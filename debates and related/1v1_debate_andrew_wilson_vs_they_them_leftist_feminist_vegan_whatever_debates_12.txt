(3:20) have a few topics and prompts for today uh we're going to be talking about
(3:26) feminism body count and abortion uh we'll go over the prompts in a moment
(3:31) but you each have a f minute opening statement and then the rest of the show it's going to be pretty much open
(3:38) conversation except for those prompt changes and we will have uh a couple breaks for messages to come through from
(3:44) the audience Andrew Wilson you're going to go first with your opening statement and then uh and then after you we'll
(3:50) have Ann uh you will go uh so go ahead Andrew yeah yeah so I appreciate it uh thanks for coming in for this debate and
(3:58) then did you want to read The Prompt so that they there's no confusion on feminism yes yes so the prompts are is
() 
(4:05) feminism good for society most abortions are
(4:11) permissible and you shouldn't care about body count if you want a relationship so
(4:16) those are the three prompts got it so let's start with my first so I have
(4:22) multiple arguments I brought to about six six arguments to whether or not
(4:27) feminism is good for society taking the affirmative claim that it is not the first is that feminism erodes the family
(4:33) and that was always its stated goal so from the uh position of original
(4:39) feminist thought leaders all the way into modern feminist thought leaders the idea of eroding what the family is has
(4:46) been a primary goal of every single individual wave of feminism starting
(4:51) with the first wave on my second argument for why it's bad for society is that feminism has switched women from
(4:58) duty to materialism you see that in the holding of debt by women this was all
(5:05) accumulated in about a 100 years since uh the 19th amendment was put into place
(5:12) and since feminism became a Mainstay it has switched from the duty based duty to
(5:18) family over to Pure materialism and what feels good which is horrible for society
(5:26) three that feminism has not increased female happiness at all you can find this there's a a now
(5:34) famous study called the Paradox declining female happiness it's a good ones by Justin wolfin it was followed up
(5:41) later on a a study by David blanchflower and in the Paradox of female happiness it states that as the material
(5:48) conditions for women opened up due to the fact that we had a more egalitarian society they have become far more
(5:56) miserable than ever and male happiness outpaces is theirs significantly in
(6:01) almost every single department and this is over all socioeconomic um uh divisions this is
(6:08) over all people groups in all places where this has been studied uh feminism
(6:14) has not done anything to increase female happiness that's for sure four feminism
(6:19) leads to male resentment and the use of force Doctrine we can touch on that it's
(6:25) not an argument that I'm going to focus on but it is one that I'm sure that we will touch on my fifth argument against
(6:31) modern feminism is that the language of indoctrination is psychology which I argue is not only a soft science and I
(6:38) would even say pseudoscientific uh but a linguistic indoctrination program and I can
(6:44) demonstrate that pretty easily uh my sixth argument against feminism is force Doctrine the idea is that my opponent
(6:53) like most feminist is likely a uh moral relativist um though they never claim
(6:58) that they moral relative they always end up being moral relativist when you dive into it and if that is the case there's
(7:04) really no argument which can be made from the moral side why men don't just use Force to enslave all women which
(7:10) they can do and there's really not much that women can do about that except we just don't we just haven't done that but
(7:16) in most parts of the world uh where that is done there's very little that women can do so essentially feminists are
(7:23) always appealing to men and men's force in order to protect their rights um the
(7:29) very same patriarchy that they're against is the very same patriarchy they necessarily have to appeal to in order
(7:35) to have rights in the first place and so the patriarchy will always be in place I think that this is a logically
(7:42) consistent view in the feminist view that the patriarchy needs to be eroded even though women cannot enforce their
(7:48) own rights absent men is inconsistent and illogical so uh those are my six
(7:53) Baseline arguments against feminism uh and we can stop it with that and move over
(8:00) all right an if you'd like you to uh respond with your opening statement yeah um well I'll make a few
(8:07) points I guess we're just starting with feminism right now um feminism promotes individual freedoms which I think uh at
(8:14) a baseline is what the government's job is to do um and so if you're looking at feminism from a legal or political
(8:20) standpoint it's quite literally the government's job to ensure that you know the type of feminism that I advocate for
(8:27) which we can kind of get into later is is you know implemented into policy now the second thing that you know you
(8:33) touched on and I'll kind of give a little bit of a response to just quickly um is about the waves of feminism um I
(8:41) probably think that you find modern feminism to be the most problematic um however modern feminist lens are more of
(8:48) what we would call a critical feminism um that's what I would probably subscribe myself to um where the goal of
(8:55) feminism is to look critically at the types of structures that exist exist in society still whether they are legal if
(9:02) they're not legal whether that be social um or you know within family structures Etc um in our institutions
(9:09) and our daily lives it's to look at the things and the ways that we interact with other people um and what types of
(9:16) things you know should be deconstructed and what types of things are still being used to oppress women even in a subversive way um now you often talk
(9:24) about this whole notion of egalitarianism and we can get into what you mean by egalitarianism but I suspect that you probably mean something like
(9:31) equality of outcomes and not equality of opportunity I would probably Advocate more for something like equality of
(9:37) opportunity versus outcomes I don't think that men and women will ever be exactly the same and I don't think that
(9:44) that's the goal of most feminists um in fact I think that might be a strong man of what most feminists are trying to do
(9:49) so what I would say is that you know when we look at people in the workforce
(9:55) the goal isn't to have the same amount of female doctors as male doctors the goal isn't to have the same amount of
(10:01) stay-at-home moms as stay at- home dads the goal is to give people the opportunity to do those things if they want to because we agree that you know
(10:08) personal freedoms once again are a good for society and they are you know good when they're able to be pursued um it's
(10:14) not necessarily that people have to pursue those things it's just that they have the ability to um and so that's
(10:20) what I would say so far and then we can get into more of like the terminology stuff yeah I mean maybe we can Define
(10:27) some terms a little bit here I mean there's yeah for the semantics feminism patriar I had a I had a few of the
() 
(10:33) semantics I wanted to clear up uh cuz I'm not sure exactly what you mean by them and I can tell you what I mean by
(10:39) them too if you'd like sure um so let's start with feminism right uh my
(10:44) definition of feminism is the movement towards an egalitarian society uh
(10:50) deconstructing the patriarchy what do you mean by egalitarian uh just basic equality
(10:56) between men and women but that's why I made the distinction earlier so equality of
(11:01) outcome or equality of opportunity because my goal would beity I even think opportunity would be fine I would just
(11:07) grant it okay sure yeah so and the deconstruction aspect is the
(11:13) patriarchy I don't think that that's a necessary part um I think that when most
(11:18) feminists are talking about like you know the patriarchy sorry I don't know if I can say you say that okay uh
(11:23) smash the patriarch smash the patriarchy screw the patriarchy whatever I don't think they're meaning literally you know
(11:29) can't have power um men can't have 51% of power or something like that do you think feminists are saying that yeah are
(11:36) are women if if feminism is saying that women are collectively oppressed who are they oppressed by well yeah most
(11:43) feminists would say that men are so that would be the patriarchy right okay but so you're saying not just men having
(11:49) power maybe we should Define patriarchy then from the father rule of the father men men in the position of power he has
(11:56) okay sure yeah I don't think women are trying to especially feminists are trying trying to abolish men out of
(12:01) power positions can men be oppressors if they don't have power no of course not but they're not trying to rid the power
(12:06) they're trying to get rid of the oppression so okay so you don't think then that power necessarily is
(12:14) oppressive no no not necessarily power not oppressive right like if you would ask a typical feminist you know like
(12:20) would it be oppressive if we had our first if comma would have gotten elected would that be like an oppressive matriarchal system or something they
(12:26) would say no it's not just the power so then feminism to you is to try to get
(12:32) men to use power oppressively feminism is trying to get
(12:37) meant to use power oppressively no to not use power oppressively yeah I I believe that feminism is about like the
(12:43) Norms about how we should act you don't think that feminism is just a descriptor of like the world right yeah I think it's just a
(12:50) descriptor do you well in the context of us doing the semantics I'm just talking about the descriptor right but you're
(12:56) asking within the descriptor can you make a claims sure you can do that with anything I guess right but feminism is
(13:02) like a philosophy about the way the world should be right like yeah it's it's a set of you know yeah but right
(13:08) now we're just talking about the descriptor itself I don't know what you mean by feminism as a descriptor then
(13:14) well so right now we're just untangling semantics right so I just want to know what you mean by the thing if you're
(13:19) saying that feminists can make a claims you're right but feminism itself is a set of a claims feminism isn't just men
(13:27) exist and they have power no no feminist well feminism to you is this right okay
(13:33) yeah so feminism to you is so I'm just trying to get a definition because it's
(13:38) somewhat proprietary still I just want to make sure feminism to you means that
(13:45) a group of women are oppressed the oppressor are men right the men in a position of power their power is fine
(13:52) it's just them being oppressive towards women with their powers not fine so the way that I look at feminism like I said
(13:58) is the push towards equal opportunity for both sexes in a society that doesn't
(14:05) necessarily mean that those Sexes will take advantage of those opportunities but that those opportunities are
(14:10) available okay so feminism to you just means equal opportunity push to equal opportunity in society right okay got
(14:17) you because that itself is a normative claim that's not a descriptive claim that's a descriptive Claim about what feminism is but feminism itself is a set
(14:24) of normative claims yeah that's fine if okay if if you if you consider it to be a normative ethical worldview that's
(14:31) that's fine with me I'm just trying to make sure I know what it is when you say it uh and then what is harm what is harm
(14:38) um there's a few different accounts of harm that um I kind of would find sufficient for different instances um so
(14:44) there can be harms of deprivation like I can deprive you of something that's harmful I can give you examples of
(14:50) things that would be harmful um or accounts of harmful there's things like counterfactual accounts of harms where
(14:55) you know imagine in another world you would have been better off had something not happened to you that would be harm in that instance um there's all sorts of
(15:03) types of harm well what do you well okay I guess I should just ask this basic
(15:09) question first do you base your ethical system around harm do I base the
(15:14) entirety of it no of course not okay so if you if you had a core principle would
(15:21) it be deontological or consequential um I think it's fine to use a mixture of of both like threshold
(15:27) deontology something like that well don't subscribe to a particular normative framework that's why I'm saying I'm I'm fine with using
(15:32) principles of both um do you think that de if not
(15:38) deontology and not consequentialism then relativism no I think if not if not no
(15:44) if no normative framework likely relativism is what I think I've probably leaned towards relativism okay gotcha so
(15:51) inside of the principle of harm since it's proprietary I actually don't feel like I got a definition from you if you
(15:57) want to look a definition up cuz it's really hard to find words on the Fly I'm actually fine with that well what I'm
(16:03) saying to you is that I find multiple types of things to be harm so it's not just that I have one set definition that
(16:08) fits all sets of things that I count as harm but that doesn't tell me what harm is though yeah sure I gave you look
(16:16) tells me that you think lots of things are that I gave you two examples of definitions so the first example would
(16:21) be if you have a counterfactual world do you know what that means when I say counterfactual Noe okay so there's
(16:27) imagine there's a possible world where you know X action or X thing had not occurred to you you know if you're
(16:33) better off in that possible world where that thing had not occurred then you've been harmed so that would be like a
(16:38) counterfactual type of harm you believe and you believe that sure yeah I think
(16:44) that is the case in some cases yeah gotcha okay and then what's the other um there's harms of deprivation um so and
(16:50) that that kind of ties into the counterfactual account right like I can say um if you were going to inherit a
(16:56) billion dollarss and I took that billion dollars I'm deprived you of that um thing that you already had claim to so
(17:02) that would be harm can be deprivation harms there can be psychological
(17:08) accounts okay and then my my next semantic question for you is what is a
(17:14) woman um so I think a woman and I do have a definition written down but um is someone who has dispositions towards
() 
(17:21) traits that are associated with females
(17:27) okay typically associated with females maybe largely based around self ID what
(17:32) does that mean what do you mean like um self-identification yeah self identification no I know I I know what
(17:38) id means um I'm asking what do you mean when you say that that definition is based around ID traits traits around
(17:45) what is feminine or what is female traits that are typically associated with females yeah so I I don't know how
(17:54) you would make the determination that you would associate with those except by self iding that way so that's a
(18:01) epistemic claim that's not a like problem with the definition right like that's a question about well how do we
(18:06) find out if someone is this thing that's not a question what this thing is yeah yeah but I'm just asking because you
(18:12) said traits so I'm just clearing up what traits are so okay so you're asking me
(18:18) how we determine what the traits are no I'm just asking you what traits are you're asking what traits are associated
(18:23) with females no just what traits themselves are you don't know what a trait is well no I'm I'm asking you what
(18:29) a trait is a trait is a property of a thing okay so then the property of the thing
(18:36) in this Cas typical properties of it's whatever the association with the feminine or female is what makes woman
(18:43) with females yeah okay got it and that's just one definition there are sufficient other definitions and then uh what is a
(18:50) woman in the context of women's rights and then I only have one more to clear these up uh that's actually a really
(18:56) good question it's highly contextual um so we're talking about like women's rights not to be maybe like essayed or
(19:03) something like that um obviously that's going to Encompass people who are
(19:10) perceived in society as women um because those people one have a right not to be you know essay um and two those people
(19:17) are perceived in the same way that females are perceived in that instance but if we're talking about something like if I want to say well women have
(19:23) the right to abortions I'm talking about people specifically with uteruses that you know can get pregnant
(19:29) and can have abortions okay so it's contextual gotcha
(19:35) and then last uh do you believe uh well in this case standpoint
(19:42) Theory do you know Fe feminist standpoint Theory are you aware of standpoint Theory at all uh can you
(19:47) describe what you mean it's that the history should be told through the lens of of women not just through the lens of
(19:53) men uh through the lens of women not just men so it both in included in the
(19:59) no history or nope it's that because women have their own propri you know their own experiences when it comes to a
(20:06) b and c that history needs to be revised also through the view of women that would depend and I'm not sure
(20:13) I don't I'm not familiar with that enough to that no big deal I just wanted to uh ask because I would have had a few
(20:19) semantic questions there too so that's it I'm done with my inquiry on semantics I just wanted to clear up a few of those
(20:24) things sure okay um so and you know the the main one that I wanted to get clear
(20:31) on was the egalitarianism um because I hear you say that a lot where you say like oh well you know it's impossible
(20:37) whatever claim you make about egalitarianism well for the for the purpose of this um if we're talking
(20:44) about uh feminism I do think that there's many feminists who do move towards the claim of egalitarianism
(20:51) being equality of outcome um but if you're saying that you're not one of those feminists it's not really worth
(20:56) harping on so I'm fine with this definitionally just including for egalitarianism the idea of equality of
(21:04) opportunity sure yeah so I'm fine with that okay I have no issues there I don't
(21:09) know if you had any other semantics that you wanted to clear up before we got into the debate um I'm assuming for woman or
(21:17) gender or whatever you just take the biological definition adult human female okay that's fine um so do you want to
(21:25) get into like open discussion or yeah yeah too open yep now we can move into it so I can I'll go back to my first
() 
(21:32) argument here let me pull it up first argument being that feminism
(21:37) erods the family and that was its stated goal are you pretty familiar with early feminist writers a few of them yeah so
(21:44) early feminism um the first waves of them started in like the depending on
(21:50) what country you're looking at but mainly in America in the late 1800s and then it moved into the early 1900s and
(21:55) that focused around kind of uh econom equality um the right to own property
(22:01) the right to vote Etc yeah well it depends on if it was commun but focusing on America yes
(22:07) largely so the idea was to erode the traditional family or the idea of a
(22:13) patriarchal family where the the uh man was at the head of the family unit the
(22:19) woman operated in a support role with children this kind of thing would you dispute that uh eroding that was a goal
(22:25) of feminism um that would be an empirical claim that I might not be able to say
(22:31) one way or another there might be feminist theorists who say like you know yes we want to completely erode every
(22:37) single patriarchal family family there are some feminist theorists who say that um a lot of those are later feminists um
(22:45) but some of them would go you know all we want is for women to have you know the right like I said the right to vote
(22:51) the right to own property the right to get equal access to jobs equal access to education things like okay well then we
(22:57) can just jump to feminism then I think so you're fine with that you're fine with granting that that that version of
(23:03) feminism that I just presented to you the historic it's not going to hurt my argument at all so no but that I I just
(23:08) want to get really clear that feminism is good for society no that's not good for still not good for society and that
(23:16) would tie into that would tie well because if you're talking about feminism and modernity so my argument is
(23:22) basically that feminism erodes the family and that was its stated goal that's my first argument so right now
(23:29) I'm giving you my argument so in feminism in modernity at least we can agree is attempting to erode at least
(23:37) the traditional family unit what you would call the cross generation or nuclear family unit who's feminism though I mean like you can argue with
(23:44) like hypothetical postmodern feminists um but if that's not me then then I'll
(23:49) argue directly with you okay do you promote alternative family units do I promote them um as a better alternative
(23:58) like like as better than a patriarchal family even equal to or even equal to sure I think in some cases they're equal
(24:04) some cases they're better if if you had government programs which promoted the
() 
(24:10) uh nuclear family or the cross-generational family at a propaganda level National level like we would do with patriotism during a war or
(24:17) things like that do you think that we would have more or less as it came to traditional family units more or less
(24:25) more or less family units if we put up propaganda MH well I mean it depends on how effective the propaganda is but sure
(24:31) I mean we probably would have more traditional family units right so then if you do a promotion for alternative
(24:37) family units that would erode that right for alternative um you mean well
(24:43) necessarily if it's going to increase the amount of of traditional family units if there's National propaganda to
(24:48) move towards necessarily I said likely but okay but even likely then it would be likely the other way around sure it
(24:54) would be likely the other way around that if we put out propaganda for something that people would latch on to it most people do sure and do you agree
(25:01) with me that alternative family unit is the propaganda which is now produced
(25:07) mostly out of leftist Institutions out of feminist institutions and out of feminist propositions to government well
(25:13) remember we're talking about my version of feminism not your version your version does that right um have I given
(25:21) you much of like I I don't think I've told you much about my version of feminism I I think you have your your
(25:26) movement so you just got done saying that you would propagate or you would
(25:32) support uh government the government itself uh pushing propaganda for alternative family units right but
(25:39) that's not no I didn't say that I we can watch this back but what do you mean by
(25:44) that like at the national level the government doing things like putting
(25:50) lgbtq flags all over the white house uh maybe putting the White House in an lgbtq flag perhaps having uh NOS non
(25:58) government organizations which are left-wing think tanks working hand inhand with government to push alternative family units which are
(26:04) staunchly feminist and psychological institutions things like that okay so I
(26:10) mean we could break up psychology but I'm not sure what that had to do with that but look so we can say you know
(26:15) these are fine these things are maybe working towards normalizing those types of family units um calling them
(26:21) propaganda seems like a loaded way to say that um and that's fine if you want to use loaded terms like that you can
(26:26) that's well we can I agree with you propaganda has a negative connotation I just don't know a better way to say it
(26:33) that people understand so you okay well you think that the normalization or the
(26:38) attempt to you know normalize something is necessarily propaganda or you think that there's a difference there no I I I
(26:44) just said I think propaganda has a negative connotation like definitionally a negative connotation but when I say
(26:50) the word propaganda I think most people understand what I mean by that word meaning there's a national campaign
(26:56) towards x a national camp okay I mean if all you're saying by a national campaign
(27:01) towards X is that people want people to be accepted as being gay or people want
(27:07) to be seen as normal for having a gay family where they have you know two parents of the same sex and children
(27:13) that live in that household if that's what you mean then sure I'm I'm fine with the United States doing things like
(27:19) putting flags on their building but not for that purpose the reason that I'm fine with that you know something like putting a pride flag up during pride
(27:26) month um is because that's a represent ation of civil rights um actually I spoke by the way little plug for my
(27:31) YouTube channel I spoke at the Florida Senate about a month ago about this um
(27:36) it's an infringement on constitutional rights um to not allow government entities to do that historically the
() 
(27:42) Supreme Court has ruled that way by the way but um that is a promotion of the
(27:48) civil rights of those people not a promotion of their lifestyle now while it might also wait
(27:55) hang on back up for me real quick um did you just say that it's a it it's unconstitutional to
(28:02) govern for for states to govern what now Flags back that up I just want to make
(28:08) sure I get this right right yeah it's um so in the instances and this is just a
(28:13) descriptor of historically how it's been um the Supreme Court has rolled it unconstitutional to regulate the types
(28:19) of speech that government entities can employ um government entities
(28:25) being do you know what a government entity is I'm just asking you so I'm just like I just didn't know if you genu
(28:32) do you do realize that that you could have proprietary definitions of things
(28:37) that may not not but I think it would be charitable to assume you know that we're kind of using similar terms that's fine
(28:44) well do you mean do you mean state government do you mean federal government do you mean local government
(28:49) historically both the Supreme cour right so this so when we say government entities I'm just trying to untangle it
(28:54) that's it sure I mean okay sure yeah government entities historically both on the federal level and the state level
(29:00) okay so like the Confederate flag they historically the Supreme Court has ruled it unconstitutional for that to be
(29:06) infringed upon okay now the issue there can be a different argument against maybe why we shouldn't allow them to do
(29:11) it maybe it's not because it's unconstitutional but maybe there's some other reason why we should infringe on their free speech um do you think do you
(29:17) think we should on the Confederate flag that would be a conversation about you
(29:23) know what's the usefulness what kind of conversation about whether or not you're consistent in your view that because
(29:28) states can do this they should be able to do this and or they should do this do you okay that's that's not true um look
(29:36) what I was saying well what I was saying was that take the instance of you know putting up a can I say the word
(29:44) swaso I would just say swasi swasi yeah take you know I put up a nice 1942 flag
(29:51) up you know on the State Building or something like that and that causes some Riot or that causes some violence or something like that um there might be an
(29:58) argument there to say well because it's had this specific negative outcome then we should restrict them from doing that
(30:03) however that's not the case with the symbolization of you know pride month the gay flags that are put up on
(30:09) buildings the intention there is to represent the civil rights of those people that would be like saying you
(30:16) can't put American flags this is a civil rights issue on either end you you think that the Civil War was a civil rights
(30:22) issue no it's a civil rights issue on either end for the flag itself so you can't say so if you say well this is
(30:28) negative right or this is positive just because one is negative doesn't mean it's not the same civil rights issue
(30:34) that you're you're you're uh pointing at here so if you're pointing at ah States states uh historically can't say
(30:40) anything or government entities can't say anything about what types of flags are put up on on you know but is it
(30:47) State Property is that what you're referencing right so government buildings yeah government buildings then
(30:53) it would still be a civil rights issue if you're saying that they shouldn't put up the the uh Confederate flag that
(30:58) would still be a civil rights problem I'm when I asked you do you think that the Civil War was a civil rights issue
(31:06) do you think that the Confederate Flag represents the civil rights of African-Americans no okay right so
(31:13) that's the cemetry breaker here and then there's also the the the well what do
(31:19) you wait what do you think a civil right is I'm do you do you think that the
(31:25) don't don't ask me a question before you answer my qu what do you think is civil rights is look a a civil right is you
() 
(31:30) know something it's actually I think pretty vague in our um legal language but a civil right is something like a
(31:36) human right that most people would call so like you have a right to put that flag up okay great I have a right to put that flag up too okay see there there
(31:42) that's where the confusion is so I'm talking about when I say you know government entities have the right to put up like Pride Flags the pride flag
(31:50) is the symbol of the civil rights of gay people to get married own property not
(31:55) be you know have their house raided while they're having sex or something like that um well well okay that's an
(32:02) assertion so so let's start with this so you just making making the claim like it
(32:07) is true that this Flag represents this that's great it represents that to this group of people I would make the same
(32:13) argue with the Confederate flag same same exact argument that's great that it represents a negative thing towards this
(32:18) group of people but it represents a positive thing towards this group of people it would be the same thing with the lgbtq flag it' be the same argument
(32:25) both ways no look the problem here is that the condition that I gave for you
(32:31) know it being fine for them to use this form of free speech is the fact that it represents the Civil Right of that group
(32:37) of people but the flag the Confederate flag doesn't represent the civil rights of who it would represent the civil
(32:44) rights of any any people who wanted to see consistency to that they can have their flag up if they so chose that
(32:50) would still be a civil right that isn't I mean maybe there's some vagueness on the Civil Rights thing but I I don't
(32:56) think that you think think that you know putting a flag up wherever you want on whatever property you want is a civil
(33:02) right you don't believe that right I think that if you were going to be consistent with your view you would need to believe that that's not okay this
(33:10) isn't answering my question um you don't think that it is a civil right to
(33:16) display I think it's a civil right if you put up a gay flag government buildings well I'm trying to answer the
(33:22) question cuz you said I wasn't answering it if you put it up on a government if you put it up on a government you ask me
(33:28) a question I was in the middle of asking you the question you said I'm not getting the answer so I was just giving you the answer so look the the question
(33:35) was do you think that it's a civil right to see your flag equally displayed because that was what you started to say
(33:40) no I think that it would be uh equally consistent to say if you can have an lgbtq flag flying on some State Building
(33:48) and that's constitutional then you'd have to say the same thing about a Confederate flag that the argument was
(33:53) from the fact that that flag represented the civil rights of that grp I me that's nice I I'm telling you is that that's an
(33:59) assertion like what demonstrate the assertion that's an assertion based off of the Supreme Court historically ruling
(34:05) it that way that's what I'm talking about I'm not making some I I can make a moral claim and we can talk about like why people shouldn't because I think you
(34:11) know there might be like violence ued by one versus the other Etc but okay so why should you be able to have the gay flag
(34:17) up but not the Confederate flag because I think that one represents the civil rights of a group whereas the other one
(34:22) doesn't one is more likely to incite violence I don't think that the is more
(34:28) is part of civil rights I think that the do I think parage is part of civil
(34:33) rights yeah when you're talking about the historical use of the FL lgbtq flag for instance this is going to have some
(34:40) type of like historical meaning to the people in which that Flag represents
(34:45) right right okay isn't the Confederate flag going to have the exact same thing it's going to have some kind of historical meaning when it comes to uh
(34:52) family lineage for people who live in the south for people who um you know
(34:57) they had ancestors who fought in this war etc etc etc it's going to be part of their Heritage and history so don't you
(35:03) think that that would have specific meaning to them as well right but there might like I said be overriding
(35:08) considerations like if hanging that flag caused violence or something like that obviously you would say like okay if we
(35:15) started hanging up Confederate flags and then more violence ensued against like African-Americans you would say we probably shouldn't hang it right so then
(35:21) by that metric are you saying that if lgbtq Flags incited violence and people who were not lgbtq we should not hang
(35:27) LGBT TQ flags and cited violence because of the flag itself like if it would have
(35:33) to be a large the same thing it would have to be a large amount of violence so long so basically what you're saying
(35:38) then just to make sure I got your view right what you're actually saying here is as long as people who don't like the
(35:46) lgbtq flag being up go ahead and commit a bunch of violence they should probably
(35:51) take the lgbtq flag down there would be multiple solutions to that but that
(35:56) could be one of them yeah if there was like let's say that was the only way to get people to stop being violent that
(36:01) might be an alternative now that's saying that that's like necessary to do to to stop the violence now if there's
(36:07) other things where we can preserve you know like the protection of the displaying of it for civil rights purposes for the for the representation
(36:13) of civil rights MH and at the same time lower the violence in some other way then yeah we should do that alternative
(36:19) I is that you think that's controversial no but now you're just switching the position because initially what you said
(36:25) was this flag if it it's causing violence uh because people it offends
(36:31) them so much that they can't help but become violent at its very at the very look of it or whatever it is how
(36:37) whatever it is that makes them respond negatively and commit violence because of this flag all that that would
(36:43) actually be doing is incentivizing people who are oppositional to the lgbtq flag to commit violence because then you
(36:49) would want to take that flag down right well for one I would say listen I would hold the same standard let's go back to
(36:55) this because I I would hold the same standard if we had a a role where we said okay we can display the Confederate
(37:00) flag and we can display the pride Flags whatever if there started to be violence committed on one end because of the
(37:06) Confederate flag I would say like okay well before we move to you know taking the flag down we should move to stopping
(37:12) the violence to whatever metric we can now there might be other reasons why I think like maybe we shouldn't display a Confederate flag I think the Confederate
(37:19) flag in and of itself represents the negative part of the history that shouldn't be displayed as if we're proud
(37:25) of it um I think it represents slavery you you don't think it does no it doesn't represent slavery represents the
(37:31) heritage of people who had family members who died in the war on behalf of their beliefs and beliefs were well the
(37:37) beliefs were to their state it was being loyal to their state most Confederate soldiers didn't have any views on
(37:42) slavery really one way or the other this was a the higher ofs who had views like this so the average soldier in fact
(37:49) there's one famous case of them saying why is it that you're fighting in this war you're so poor you can't own a slave
(37:56) and the response was cuz yall are here so what that means is is that as the north was invading the South there was a
(38:02) lot of incentive for people to go and fight against it they called it there the war of Northern aggression and uh
(38:08) yeah they had many of them had cause they got their houses burned down things like this during Northern marches to
(38:14) assist in combat in that war and yeah I'm sure that people are very proud of the Heritage that they come from in the south from people fighting for the core
(38:21) beliefs and on behalf of their families even if you don't like the cause itself the cause itself is still very much
(38:27) baked into the American history just like uh like for instance I couldn't ban
(38:33) the the lgbtq flag because of HIV right couldn't be like well that's a stain on our history the fact that there was a
(38:39) bunch of gay sex parties and they were giving it to each other I couldn't do that right I don't think that you can uh
(38:44) make a good honest argument as to why it is that people couldn't be proud of the heritage of their family fighting the in
(38:49) the Civil War look the the flag is a symbol of the leaders of that war right
(38:57) the people you you just admitted this the people who respond in that way oh well I'm we're fighting because you guys
(39:03) are here they're there because they're there they I mean they they live there they're trying to protect their homes
(39:09) and properties that's perfectly fine the problem is is the people who were starting those wars were the ones who were using those flags that's like
(39:15) saying like well you know so and so wasn't a Nazi and you know well I don't know if I can say that word um uh
(39:22) you know so and so wasn't a you know Schatzi in World War II they just had families that were you know schi members
(39:28) or maybe they were just fighting because they thought it was like a good thing they were fighting the other powers that invaded you wouldn't say certainly then
(39:35) that like they should allow you know Schatzi flags on govern building if the
(39:40) standard is that we're allowed to put up the flag of our choosing because it has
(39:47) some representation value that we see it as like let's say the people saw the schi flag as being something other than
(39:54) iHeart Hitler um I wouldn't see a problem with that no of course not if
(39:59) okay so even though that it is linked to that it is linked to support of Hitler
(40:05) and the lgbtq flag is linked to HIV okay that's how I mean people see it people
(40:11) see it as like oh wow AIDS right they see they see the rainbow flag I think a lot of people think AIDS yeah that's
(40:18) fine but there's not like gay leaders that are out there like pushing for AIDS right there's not like anybody out there
(40:24) pushing for the Confederacy who's pushing for the confeder I live in the Deep South there's people pushing for the Confederacy give me a single actual
() 
(40:32) institution of any kind anywhere or any real body of people anywhere who's
(40:38) pushing for the Confederacy what do you think that I mean there have been moves historically to seed some of the states
(40:45) again um that's not the Confederacy because of the what was speaking but
(40:50) there have been moves moves to seed States again for those particular reasons and go back to having the
(40:57) Confederacy again no there's not I live in the south I'm I'm well yeah there's not in M there's there's no serious
(41:04) there's no serious move demonstrate then show me a serious movement modernity I mean you could take people like the
(41:10) proud boys but the proud boys don't want the Confederacy what are you talking about they tons of them do no they don't
(41:18) tons of them I know Gavin mcginness personally I know for sure that he had no plans to Institute the Confederate
(41:25) States of America with the proud boed Enrique the former head what by the way
(41:32) uh he's I think half black or half Hispanic himself he has absolutely no plans to move towards the Confederate
(41:38) States of America that's absurd they might not have practical plans to but you couldn't ask some of these people
(41:44) like I said I I live in the south I mean like we can table this here because if it's just going to be like oh this is an
(41:49) empirical claim there's absolutely no one that's pushing for the Confederacy I think that's absurd I no no that's not
(41:54) what I said what did I actually say what was my actual position repeat it my actual position was there's no serious
(42:01) body anywhere anywhere not not an NGO even that I'm aware of that is pushing
(42:07) for the reinstitution of the Confederate States of America not a single one that can the and that the Confederate flag
(42:15) the only thing you seem to be able to appeal to is well because conf because in the South there was slavery and this
(42:22) was a flag that the South utilized that means therefore that it's a symbol of slavery that is not not only is that not
(42:29) logical it doesn't follow right but you haven't even demonstrated that the people who want the flag there view it
(42:36) as a symbol of slavery they clearly don't only the opposition does right are you guys okay if we move this back to feminism though or but this is part of
(42:43) the consistency of the worldview I just I just want to make it very clear that Civil War was fought over slavery that
(42:49) that has nothing to do with claim my claim the Confederate leaders of the Civil War were fighting for when did I
(42:55) make the claim that it wasn't over I'm just making that clear for this conversation when did I make that claim
(43:02) you you aru people that the people who were fighting in the war most of them weren't just fighting for slavery they
(43:09) weren't but the leaders of those armies were fighting for that some well some of
(43:14) them were and some of them even were abolitionists in their own right but I do agree with you that generally
(43:20) speaking leadership there did want to keep the institution of slavery intact I'm not disputing that what I am
(43:26) disputing is that when and Southerners see the Confederate flag as a sign of their cultural heritage which comes down
(43:32) to their uh family members defending their homes when the north came in and started burning them out amongst other
(43:38) reasons that they wanted there as a symbol of slavery and that's the argument you're actually making that's
(43:45) that's not true but then then why shouldn't it be there I I said that well one there could be an argument that it
(43:51) incites violence because it does in some instances it's used as a symbol when violence occurs especially in the
(43:57) great so we have to capitulate to people who become violent because of a symbol capitulate to people who become
(44:04) violent because of a symbol they're not violent because of the symbol they're violent because they share the values
(44:09) that that symbol represented during that war so then therefore violent because of symbol no no how did you get that from
(44:15) that well because I don't see what I don't understand why are they being violent because the Confederate flag is there they're violent because they share
(44:22) the same values as the people who flew that flag in that war no they don't what values are they
(44:28) Shar they own slaves there are people there are people in the South who want to own slaves yeah I don't how many
(44:34) people in the South do you think want to own slaves there's look there's groups of people that doesn't matter there's
(44:39) not there's no significant movement anywhere in the South to own slaves even if they don't desire that particular
(44:47) portion of the like the negative ideological you know set of things that people in the South believe during the
(44:53) Confederacy there is lumped in with that racism because of the fact that it was a
(44:59) a tool to push for slavery right so that was racist I so why do we fly the
(45:05) American flag what it's like a joke no it's not a joke it's not like a joke I don't I
(45:12) really don't understand the position the position of like but they see it as being racist they are linking this
(45:17) symbol to their feelings we're not going to capitulate you want you honestly are trying to Advocate that people should
(45:23) capitulate to symbolism under legal expression because it makes them feel bad and by capitulate you mean take it
(45:30) down so you're saying that I think that we should take down Confederate flags if
(45:35) they cause violence and if they are they're not causing violence and if they are sure I mean if they are linked to
(45:42) people who are causing violence right because they share the same values of the people who initially flew those
(45:47) flags then yeah I think that's totally reasonable I would really hope you would say the same thing about the Schatzi
(45:53) flag I really this is a totally insane claim so if somebody's F flying the Confederate flag and it's offensive
(45:59) enough you keep on acting like well if the flag is causing violence the flag doesn't cause violence flag is nothing
(46:06) it's a piece of cloth it has no ability to cause anybody violence people would be causing violence on behalf of they
(46:13) don't like that they don't like that flag so what you're all you're doing is making an argument saying we should
(46:18) capitulate to mobs who don't like things and are willing to cause Violence by taking down the thing that's not a look
(46:24) I I think that that's a complete Str man of the argument the argument is multi-pronged it's not just oh if people
(46:30) don't like thing take thing down that's not the argument it sure sounds like that's the argument that is which part
(46:35) of it am I straw Manning that is a consideration into whether or not we should allow something or not there can
(46:40) be multiple considerations that's one of them okay well I can I guess we can move on to the second argument then if you
(46:46) want to move past this one sure uh so SW uh feminism has switched women from duty
(46:51) to materialism can you explain what you mean by that first yeah I can't think of a single uh when you talk about
(46:58) egalitarianism being I want so let's start with this I guess are rights real
() 
(47:05) real in what sense do they materially exist anywhere are they concepts of the mind uh yeah rights are concepts of the
(47:12) mind yeah so they don't they don't actually exist right no something that's a concept still exists where yeah like
(47:19) feelings exist thoughts exist where they exist within the mind you just said that yeah where is that in the mind where is
(47:27) that though in brains so the brain exists inside the mind the the mind is constituted of the
(47:34) brain the brain is the mind then that that might be a semantic thing but I'm
(47:39) fine with saying whatever however you want to parse out those terms that yes Concepts come from Minds Minds either
(47:45) are or come from brains okay so well are is the mind the brain look that's
(47:53) that's a complex question I don't have the answer to I don't either so I'm just want to make sure that I understand where Concepts exist I mean look if you
(48:01) just want to say the brain just for Simplicity that's fine I'm not sure like are you like well versed on philosophy
(48:06) of mind or something is that like I'm not trying to move you into philosophy of mind I'm just I'm just trying to ask you about rights being a concept cuz
(48:14) when I say that they're not real you say they are real cuz concepts are real but
(48:19) I don't understand how Concepts themselves are real yeah they're real as in they're you know things that are from
(48:25) the mind okay so thoughts are you wouldn't say a thought is not a real thing a thought is a real
(48:30) thing well when you say objective or subjective what do you mean by objective
(48:36) or subjective I didn't use those words but usually in philosophy objective means mind independent and subjective
(48:43) means mind dependent okay right so so Concepts then they're dependent on a mind yeah of
(48:49) course okay so they they don't exist absent of mind they don't exist absence of Minds no okay so if all human being
(48:56) were gone rights would not exist because the concepts would be gone right well I didn't say human Minds there could be
(49:02) you know some alien you know the Xenomorphs or whatever come down and they have their own concepts of Rights
(49:08) then yeah I that's still a m they have rights Etc yeah no sure if there was aliens they okay just to clarify it's
(49:14) not just human Minds it is just you know Minds that can conceptualize of Rights whatever those minds are sure okay got
(49:20) it so when we're talking about rights though you exist they don't exist in any sort of material reality material that
(49:28) question hinges upon the like you know is the mind the brain or not you can't taste them touch them smell them see
(49:33) them that kind of thing sure no of course not yeah okay got it so uh rights for all intents and purposes are just
(49:39) things that we make up sure that doesn't make them any less real well I guess we're going to have to
(49:46) clear this up again then real how is a thing is a unicorn real well as a
(49:54) fictional concept yeah as a concept it's real as a as a fiction just to be clear
(50:00) there's a um way that fiction is used in a technical sense um I'm not super familiar with it but you can point to
(50:06) things that are fiction and things that aren't fiction um so it would be like well maybe Spider-Man is real in a sense
(50:14) but he's real in a fical way he's still real right there's still a book there's still movies about him there's still
(50:19) actors that play him in a sense there is well he's really in your mind Spider-Man right well there there are material
(50:25) things tied to Spider-Man right but there is a real concept of Spider-Man he's just real in a fictional sense got
(50:31) it so then for you uh rights actually do exist as more than they're they're not
(50:37) they're when you say concept you actually believe concepts are real in some sense I I think they're real in a mind
(50:44) dependent way mind dependent when you say so I think what you're doing here and you can correct me if I'm wrong I'm
(50:50) making sure we just don't equivocate that yeah but it it seems like what you are doing might be a little bit of that but it might seem like you're saying
(50:57) something is only real if and only if it's material um do you believe that or
(51:02) no I don't no I'm just making sure that we get the view clear sure talk there can be real things even if we don't have
(51:08) a specific definition there can be real things that aren't material yeah Concepts yeah sure okay got it so rights
(51:14) are a concept yeah they they are concept but they are real because there because but in the
(51:20) sense concept yeah in the sense that concepts are real right just like your feelings are real just like your
(51:25) thoughts your dreams are real got it and concepts are changeable right just like rights um the concepts themselves yeah
(51:33) the the way that people think of things yeah change sure okay so we've established that rights are just
(51:39) Concepts Concepts can be real I'll just agree in that sense because again it doesn't really matter I guess in this uh
(51:46) particular confine so um when I say duty duty you would
(51:53) have to exist or you'd have to admit is also real then as a concept what do you mean by Duty obligations that you have
() 
(52:01) absent entitlements and I would classify rights as being entitlements you have absent
(52:08) obligations so you said a duty is an obligation absent an entitlement
(52:15) yeah and then you said that what was the second that um for a right it would be
(52:22) an entitlement absent of Duty
(52:29) okay yeah so I don't actually see any duties women have in mity none like no
(52:37) no actual duties duties to what anything you don't like in a moral sense or no in
(52:45) any sense so I I see a lot of entitlements rights entitlements absent
(52:50) Duty so you you have the right to vote no duty to vote right to own a gun no duty to own a gun right you have the
(52:57) right to incriminate or not incriminate yourself but no duty to incriminate yourself or not to incriminate yourself
(53:02) right every one of these rights is an entitlement there's no Duty which comes along with it so I think that in the a
(53:12) time before feminism let's say especially the the 1900s that instead of women and men in
(53:19) this case moving towards a materialistic Outlook they focused a lot more on
(53:24) duties instead of entitlements the elves and I think that that has been very bad for society the focus on materialism
(53:31) from feminism okay maybe just to get more clear on that term Duty um being an
(53:37) obligation absent entitlement um what you're saying is that you know somebody
(53:43) should act or needs to act right without being giving anything to act no they
(53:48) could be given orders to act that could be consider but I'm saying okay maybe there was some miscommunication there
(53:54) but something that you know you should do whether or not you're rewarded for it or something like that is that something
(54:00) like what you mean yeah okay so some some obligation to do it's yeah some
(54:06) obligation absent entitlement to perform X action
(54:12) okay now that's not a perfect definition but I think it's like a workable one for the purpose of the
(54:23) conversation okay so you think that you know women don't have any duties but they do have but I think men
(54:30) do I think men have duties can we get clear on if you're making a descriptive claim or if you're making some sort of
(54:36) like prescriptive claim descriptive descriptive okay so you think that men have duties and women don't yes and that
(54:41) you think that women have rights and men don't have rights or they do I think that women have more rights than men do
(54:49) so this would come down to my argument for conscription it's very simple men have a duty and obligation to sign up
(54:58) for the draft women have no such obligation or duty to do so but women can still vote to send them to Wars and
(55:05) then not fight in them because they can't be drafted so I would consider that to be an extra right that women
(55:12) have that men do not have because they are um they they actually have to sign
(55:18) up or and be conscripted during war time okay sure and absent war time okay so
(55:24) this is argument feminism bad because men have to go to the draft and women don't and they both get the right to
(55:30) vote no this is an argument for materialism I'm just expressing that when we moved away from a duty-based
(55:36) society for women there's no I can't think of any actual obligations that women have as far as duties to society
(55:42) but I can think of actual obligations that men do have still as a duty to society and so it seems that women
(55:49) themselves actually have more rights in modern society than men do and also
(55:55) right that um a lot of this movement towards the idea of more additional
(56:01) rights comes from materialism itself everything seems to stally revolve around I want me me me me I want I want
(56:09) I want because it feels good okay um sure I'm not sure maybe we could get
(56:15) more clear on materialism there um I'm not for the draft I am for people voting I think people should vote so if you're
(56:21) making descriptive claims about like okay will you think that this moved towards materialism and I'm thinking
(56:27) maybe you're talking about like Marxist materialism or do you mean something totally like do you mean materialism in
(56:33) a totally different field yeah in this case very simple right I'm just uh using
(56:38) materialism in the sense of uh stuff stuff in the replacement for something
(56:45) that is not stuff like uh for instance if we're talking about concepts of God
(56:50) of country of nation of state things like that which could be fulfilling and material materialism would be the idea
(56:57) that like stuff can be fulfilling like actual material Goods things like this can be a form of fulfillment okay so
(57:05) materialism from what you're defining is that material Goods can be fulfilling yeah okay this has to do what with
(57:13) feminism that what feminism has done is move women more towards
(57:20) materialism than um than duties duties would be this idea of the
(57:25) conceptualization of I ought to do things outside of um because it feels
(57:32) good whereas materialism is I'm going to get this stuff because it feels
(57:37) good right um I mean I can think that people should do things because I think it would have good outcomes for them
(57:44) like I think that people should vote because I think that that helps them pursue their political goals more um and
(57:50) I think that people enjoy freedom I think that's good for people's well-being is to have personal freedom
(57:56) to be it seems to be that limiting people's personal freedoms is pretty good for their well-being well it seems
() 
(58:02) oh okay well in some senses you would agree with that in some senses you wouldn't I assume yeah in some there you
(58:08) can make you can make delineation thresholds but the everybody voting has been a disaster it's been terrible what
(58:14) do you mean by that I mean that uh by everybody being able to collectively vote rather than people had stake in the
(58:20) system what's been able to happen is that the treasury has been able to be robbed by the collect power of the vote
(58:28) so what happens is politicians end up creating V blocks voting blocks they P
(58:33) the voting blocks against each other and all of all of the these various blocks are trying to raid the treasury
(58:38) essentially for their own personal agendas every single block that I can think of in fact is trying to raid the treasury based on an agenda right but
(58:46) presumably you think some of those AG one some of those agendas are good and two you think that generally there's
(58:51) also good outcomes from everybody voting right no there's generally not good out comes from everybody voting there's
(58:57) there's not a single good outcome or I didn't say there's not a single good outcome i' never put it in a monolith but what's a question I just answered
(59:03) the question I would say I would not say that there's never a single good outcome right so you just happen to believe that
(59:09) the good outcomes don't outweigh the bad outcomes well yeah that's how I would weigh anything when it came to the
(59:15) political process right right so okay I mean we can just take for example you think that it's generally good just
(59:22) Prima fashy good to protect individual freedoms right like H to to a degree
(59:28) well I can give you I think I can probably give you infinitely many cases where you would say it's good to protect infinite I think I can give infinitely
(59:34) many cases in the opposition where you would think it was really good to limit them probably probably probably not in
(59:40) the real world like I can take for example um okay you waking up and breathing this morning that's a right that should that's an personal freedom
(59:46) that should be protected you waking up and owning a machine gun is that a personal right that should be protected um that's going to hinge on like an
(59:52) epist like that's going to be some like empirical claim that I don't it's not an empirical claim whether or not you what
(59:58) do you mean no the whether or not I think that that's a rate that should be protected is going to hinge on empirical
(1:00:04) data so you know whether or not that causes more bad out own a nuke I think
(1:00:09) probably there would be really bad outcomes if you nuk probably so you'd want to limit that right right what about a battleship with like uzi's strap
(1:00:16) to it that did a like 360 Turn Style Just mowing everything down I should probably not have that either right or
(1:00:21) hand grenades right and those are instances that we don't currently have I'm talking about literally from you
(1:00:28) breathing to you sitting at the table to you holding a pen to you wearing a shirt to you being in the studio to being in
(1:00:34) America oh sorry um to you being able to drink water all of those things are personal freedoms and you believe that
(1:00:40) all of those things should be protected and there's probably less of those like insane scenarios than uh is Brea
(1:00:46) breathing is not a right what do you mean you don't have a right to breathe it's a function it's a function of what
(1:00:52) you do an empirical right to it right but you have a right to life and stopping you from breathing do you have
(1:00:57) a right to life or do you have a concept that you have a right to life yeah the but yeah the the right is the concept
(1:01:03) concept yeah so the idea here is the the concept yeah I'm not sure that people have a right to life like if you steal
(1:01:09) my TV I don't think you have a right to life well sure those rights can be overridden those are overriding they
(1:01:14) don't exist that's why they do mean there's not really anything so the concept here right it can be overwritten
(1:01:20) and changed because the concept itself is flawed the idea of Rights themselves are flawed so when you're talking about
(1:01:27) uh your like First Amendment right or something like this when you talk about freedoms in general uh yeah I think that
(1:01:34) we have all sorts of Duties which override those rights all the time right so but you have to make the case that
(1:01:40) this is one of those instances where you should override somebody's rights so when women started hold on don't don't
(1:01:46) interrupt me that's you just told me to give you the very impolite very impolite do you think that I'm the only one cutting in I think I've probably cut in
(1:01:53) far less but look so you think that there's all of these instances where like you shouldn't have your right to
(1:01:58) breathe infringed upon you shouldn't have your you know your right to XYZ that doesn't mean that those things aren't real just because they can be
(1:02:04) overridden I I don't know what the argument for that would be what that so
(1:02:10) the concepts themselves right these things are changeable Concepts right
(1:02:15) yeah all of them are changeable the the concept itself is and where does the concept exist and does it exist in all
(1:02:21) brains or does it exist in one brain well I think that people have different concept of right what I am saying though
(1:02:28) is when people say I have a right to life they're not saying I have a right to life in every single imaginal
(1:02:34) possible scenario you like do you know that do do you like know that like when
(1:02:39) you express things that you should Express them precisely so that I know exactly what it is that you do mean so
(1:02:45) when you say so when you say like do you know when people say x that what they
(1:02:51) actually mean is y it's like no I don't actually know that because from what you're you're saying is when people say
(1:02:57) x they this this is this is it you just leave it on rights that's what people say and it's like now you clarify and
(1:03:04) say well when people say x they really don't always mean X like fair enough I can grant that that is true but he
(1:03:11) didn't really make that case you're not just granting that it's true though here's the here's what happened though is that you said that um well there's
(1:03:16) instances where these rights can be overridden um right so you do recognize that people when they say you have the
(1:03:22) right to life they aren't talking about the right to life in an absolute sense that was so that's a pedantic way to look at my
(1:03:28) words maybe my words were sloppy there right it's just a way for me to categorize the words that you understand
(1:03:34) what I'm saying so I could say override or something like this if you want to pin me on it I can use a different word
(1:03:40) but the entire idea here though is that these are just Concepts because they're just Concepts they're very changeable in
(1:03:45) the human experience as Concepts and they only exist in single brains they don't exist in Collective brains right
(1:03:51) they can't every single brain has to have some variation of this Con concept
(1:03:56) right sure but people have General like uh agreements on what a concept means so
(1:04:02) they can approximate as close as they can but when somebody says you know like I said they they have the right to life
(1:04:08) or they have the right to breathe I I would think that you know that they're not saying and also just to reframe this
(1:04:15) because you said it's like oh well when people are saying they're X you're saying they actually mean Y no I'm saying they mean something like X
(1:04:21) asteris you know to the right hand corner that but that's not what I said I
(1:04:27) think I think that's kind of Well it can't be X and not X so it has to be X actually means not X right but it could
(1:04:32) be x with like an additional Clause that's understood to be true like when you have conversations there are things
(1:04:38) that you understand with people like there's social cues like people I think people typically I agree just making
(1:04:45) sure that that if there's a meaningful distinction we untangle the meaningful distinction if there's not we don't sure
(1:04:51) okay so when people talk about rights I mean because I guess we'll just get 100% clear on this now when talk about rates
(1:04:56) they're typically not talking about some absolute you know ability to do anything some entitlement to do anything no
(1:05:03) matter what okay I agree sure but I never thought that that was in dispute you
(1:05:10) what was in dispute is the concepts themselves right so the idea is well I
(1:05:15) have a right to do X and then somebody comes along and says no you don't and puts a bullet in your head right did he
(1:05:20) have the right or did you have the right did the person who put the bullet
(1:05:27) into somebody's head have a right to do that yeah not for the person who they did it right exactly so then these are
(1:05:33) just Concepts they're individual they're they're mind dependent concepts for
(1:05:38) individual Minds themselves they're not even collectivize there can be rights that we like agree upon sure you can
(1:05:45) agree you can agree to them right but you can't really say that when somebody else comes along and says but I have a
(1:05:51) right to violate your rights they don't have a right to do that that's the problem with them right they under your
(1:05:57) like frame of Rights they they don't have that per your standard they don't have that right yeah but per their
(1:06:03) standard they do yeah that's just trivially true if you're you're just saying like trivial and trivial truths
(1:06:08) are true because they're true so the thing is is like yes it's trivially true
(1:06:13) trivially true uh just meaning it's true that if a person says well I have the
(1:06:20) right to kill you and you say you don't have the right to kill me right I just want to know who actually he has the
(1:06:26) right to do what actually has the right yeah what do you mean by that who here actually has the right to do something
(1:06:32) who here actually can actualize this right okay the question is who has the
(1:06:39) ability to do what they want to do well obviously the person with the gun I don't do you think what right did that
(1:06:45) other person actually have well the person okay maybe we should get clear on what you mean by a right what do you
(1:06:51) mean by a right I've already told you like 50 times it's a entitlement absent Duty yeah so okay they have the right
(1:06:59) and these rights are you know like I believe that I have an entitlement you
(1:07:04) know to my life believe right so if they believe that to them they had the right
(1:07:10) to the other person they did not have the right right so in this case really what it boils down to is your rights are
(1:07:16) just force right rights come force is the way that
() 
(1:07:21) the rights are protected well it's the only way they can really exist no they do exist you you admitted that
(1:07:28) Concepts exist right so like somebody can I can grant that they exist sure right so they do exist without Force
(1:07:35) quote unquote um well no not actualizing them though actual so you didn't get clear
(1:07:42) what you mean by actualizing yeah so if you want to have the right to freedom of speech and there's nobody around I
(1:07:48) suppose you would have the right to freedom of speech because you're you're the only mind which has this concept in it but if you come into contact with
(1:07:55) another mind who says you don't have the right to freedom of speech right how do we determine which mind actually has a
(1:08:01) right here and which one doesn't the only we can't right we just say you have a concept in your mind and you have a
(1:08:08) concept in your mind but this rights thing right this thing doesn't really exist just this concept is what exists
(1:08:15) see you keep saying it doesn't really exist of course it exists like you said if you're on the island and nobody's there to infringe upon that right even
(1:08:22) if somebody does infringe upon that right you could still say well that person has the right to life they have the right to speech then then people
(1:08:29) have the right to kill other people if they want to well that's not what I said per that person they no it is what
(1:08:37) you're saying they would that statement would be true okay to them if if it is the case that
(1:08:44) collectively Society decides that they have a right to enslave women they do in
(1:08:49) fact have that right in reality to do that don't they if you're saying that they're acting on what they believe is
(1:08:56) to be a right then yeah that's what they're doing that's Tri that doesn't so these are
(1:09:01) descriptive claims though I'm not interested well right now we're just making sure that we have this so so I just want to make sure I got this right
(1:09:07) and that that we're not speaking past each other rights are real as Concepts concepts are real yes so therefore if it
(1:09:16) is the case that uh conceptually people want to enslave all women and they call
(1:09:22) that concept A right then they would have the right to enslave women and that would be a real right that they would
(1:09:27) have right to them what you're missing is the index so like when I say I have a
(1:09:34) right I am talking like I said about more so um a belief or value sometimes
(1:09:41) is what I'm referencing um so when somebody says like even if someone was in prison
(1:09:47) wrongfully maybe like they didn't actually commit a crime but it was believ that they committed a crime and that person said I have the right to be
() 
(1:09:53) free now they're not saying something nonsensical you understand like what that person is saying they're saying you
(1:09:59) know I desire to be free um it's wrong and what they mean by you know it's wrong is it goes against their values
(1:10:06) for them to be it just goes It goes against their preferences right yeah in that case so that that statement is true
(1:10:13) yeah sure but it's equally true to say no we're going to keep you a slave not to that person yeah not to that person
(1:10:18) but just to the other people not once again not not to that person and not to me certainly but if it is the case that
(1:10:25) rights themselves being a value of the con concept of the Mind these concepts are real then that would mean that all
(1:10:32) people who were slaves had the right to be free that's true but also that all people who enslave people have the right
(1:10:38) to enslave them and that's also equally true correct if what you mean like we can substitute if what this is what you
(1:10:44) mean I yeah if you let me finish sentences I can do that okay so when you have the people who are enslaving other
(1:10:51) people if what you mean by those people saying I have the right to enslave these people is that those people are you know
(1:10:57) substituting out their words for like I have the value that these people are enslaved then to them that is true they
(1:11:03) do in fact have that value so so for you a right is
(1:11:08) simply wait I'm confused now now I'm actually confused on your view you said
(1:11:14) right is just a belief yeah I think well when we were talking about like Concepts yeah okay if it's just a belief then
(1:11:21) it's an equally true belief that these people over here their right to inst you exists it's equally true and because the
(1:11:28) wording I think people use this wording in a weird way sometimes um what would be more accurate to say is that that
(1:11:35) person desires this they value this or they prefer this okay so what gives them the right
(1:11:41) to something that's what I'm saying that the right is so like usually when talk about well you can talk about rights as
(1:11:47) social contracts um and maybe they're violating a social contract in that way but when I say like I have a right to be
(1:11:53) free a lot of the times what I'm expressing is like you know a very strong desire or something like that yeah just a belief that you have sure I
(1:12:00) mean that's what those people are saying so if you're just saying it is true that those people to them it is true I have
(1:12:07) the right to enslave this person and if you substitute what they mean by that by I desire to enslave these people or I
(1:12:13) have a strong will to do so then that's trivially true you don't disagree with that certainly well with your view no
(1:12:21) this is great uh you have to concede that the right is real that people collectively have
(1:12:28) the right to enslave people and that that is real concepts are real belief is Real by right is it's real in the sense
(1:12:36) that they do in fact believe or value that thing yeah that's that is now in
(1:12:41) fact believe and value is that belief that you can hold people in slavery is
(1:12:47) that a belief which I I obviously you're against it right I'm not saying you're
(1:12:52) not um but Bel this this value which is real this concept which is true they
(1:12:59) actually do have the right to do this is that morally worse than your than your view that they shouldn't to me yeah to
(1:13:07) you and that's it only to you right because it doesn't make you feel good right if I'm well there's you can say
(1:13:14) words like that like you can say doesn't make me feel good that would be more in line with somebody who takes some like emotivist view on that type of thing um
(1:13:21) but I'm fine with saying that you know there's a proposition that you know that is wrong and by that I mean that you
(1:13:28) know that's something that goes against my values got it or my desires or preferences so now now we've untangled
(1:13:34) all of that this argument actually becomes much easier so the goal of feminism is to uh push PE or push women
(1:13:45) specifically towards materialism and not Duty and I think that the belief of people in duty is much more important
() 
(1:13:51) than the belief of people in materialism so think that um the idea of
(1:13:57) having duties to Nation the idea that having duties to family the idea that having duties to community far outweigh
(1:14:03) the idea of the right to pursue whatever trivial meaning meaningless uh material
(1:14:09) Pursuit that you have that Duty should come first and that society would look better if they did well that's okay
(1:14:15) there's a few things here um that moves from a descriptive claim to like a applied claim or like an of claim or a
(1:14:22) pragmatic thing um and then there's the other type of thing where it's like you
(1:14:27) say feminism has like pushed us towards these things towards these material you want demonstration for that sub well
(1:14:34) really quickly you you think that feminism is pushing people towards subjectivism and that that's bad like
(1:14:41) there's a two-pronged claim there right no less so for towards subjectivism more so towards
(1:14:47) materialism okay well it seems it kind of seemed like you were doing a little bit of equivocating here what's the
(1:14:53) equivocation between subjectivism and materialism but if you're not then maybe we can kind bring up subjectivism there
(1:14:59) just materialism that was what we were just talking about no what we were talking about is after we untangle all
(1:15:05) of the concepts what all we're really talking about is just everything reduces to beliefs so all of these concepts of
(1:15:13) Rights everything else just reduces in at least to you to believe I believe
(1:15:18) thing which is fine it's just equal for me to say I believe opposite thing and those are just as morally valuable as
(1:15:25) the other at least from your view that's all I was establish that's not true that's not true actually so that's a misunderstanding So when you say that
(1:15:32) they're equally morally as valuable well they're not equally morally as valuable to
(1:15:37) me yeah and then there's a there's a pragmatic claim where we can kind of discuss after that like okay well let's
(1:15:42) say we have conflicting values then what you know what do we do it's more so
(1:15:47) we can then look at okay well what's maybe some underlying values that we share um where we can build off of that
(1:15:53) I'm aware of all of that but um no that would still reduce to relativism then right like how can you
(1:16:00) make ever a claim that some other mind whatever their moral proposition was if
(1:16:06) everything is just based on your preference is less good than your preference how I don't even know how
(1:16:12) that can be done you don't under well how you just explained it where I'm you're saying that the things that are
(1:16:18) good to you aren't the things that are good to me so you might say well these are subjectively good to me and
(1:16:24) therefore they're equally as good as the things that you believe and I my response to that would be no I don't believe that because the things that are
(1:16:31) good to me are my values your values don't meet mine perfect so then you're
(1:16:37) you believe that you are the architect of all morality and by that you mean you
(1:16:42) everything for which you believe is the ultimate form of morality ultimate form
(1:16:48) in what way there's no other and no no counter moral claims made to you are are
(1:16:55) ever going to be as good as the moral claims you make there can be counter moral claims that are made to me that
() 
(1:17:00) appeal to my values that maybe I'm not aware of or that I have like conflicting underlying values because you then
(1:17:05) prefer them right sorry the only thing that make them good is that you then prefer them yeah there could be something like that so then you would be
(1:17:12) the ultimate AR if I adopted them for for my morality right like that would make that thing good well your morality
(1:17:18) is the only thing that is good though to me well what what else is good except good to you the uh said look I I just
(1:17:25) said that it's the thing that it I am orbiting is my morals my moral stances
(1:17:31) so then so then the only way we can have good is if it's good to you yeah of course yeah so then if that's the case
(1:17:37) then all things you are the ultimate Arbiter of goodness of my standard of goodness there can't be any other
(1:17:43) standard of goodness there is I AG do you think that I am denying that other people have their own standards you're
(1:17:48) this is circular you I'm like I'm making the argument I don't know why you're not agreeing with it you only
(1:17:55) things which are good to you are good the things that are good to me are good to me nothing else is good except things
(1:18:01) good to you nothing else is good except things which you find well there can be other people who agree with the things
(1:18:06) that I find to be good so then that those things are good to me and good to them yeah so so but they're only good because they're good to you they're only
(1:18:13) good because they're good to me yeah there's things that are good to me and I can convince other people that they should also only find those things to be
(1:18:19) good can anything be good unless it's good to you are you saying that can I
(1:18:25) approve of something and not approve of something at the same time well no yeah right so then all all goodness comes
(1:18:31) from you all goodness comes from me that my my standards of good come from me of
(1:18:38) course is there any other standard other than yours which is good relative to me unless it aligns
(1:18:46) with my idea or value then no then you are the ultimate Arbiter of goodness of my own that's the only kind that there
(1:18:53) is there is no kind reduce this like six times it always comes back to if we look
(1:18:58) at good as values right I'm not denying that you have values I'm not denying that Brian has values I'm not denying
(1:19:04) that you know Joshua down the road has values so there are things that are good to those other people but relative to me
(1:19:11) unless they align with my values they're not so then so then you are a moral relativist look I'm I'm fine with if you
(1:19:16) want to call that moral Rel it be when you say it's relative to you is relative to me so where does that bring us look
(1:19:23) if I just say look I am World relativist fine whatever you want to call it would be fantastic we at least make some
(1:19:29) headways because what I'm saying to you is is that from a prescriptive claim
(1:19:34) then if it's all just relative then you can't really say that Islam enslaving
(1:19:39) women is morally bad it's just morally bad to you right and because saying that to me and because it's you can only say
(1:19:46) it's bad to you but because it's relative right you can't it's probably bad to a lot of other people but it is
(1:19:51) bad to me but you just said that it's relative like you can't make the claim really since it's relative they're good
(1:19:57) to them it's good to me well because otherwise then just admit you're the ultimate Arbiter of all goodness look
(1:20:03) that even if I accepted that semantic usage there that I'm the ultimate Arbiter of goodness which I would add
(1:20:10) that ASC on the end that like no I'm the ultimate Arbiter of my moral values and my goodness I mean that's that's fine
(1:20:17) that doesn't bring us anywhere else I can still look at people and go the things that they're doing don't match up with my values and that to me is bad
(1:20:23) yeah but but what my claim is that it would have to then necessarily be at at least it seems to be from all the
(1:20:29) questions you've answered that if they don't match up with your values per it that is what is bad and only things
(1:20:37) which match up with your values are what is good and nothing else is good to me
(1:20:42) and well but I don't disagree do you think if it's only focused on you who else could it be focused on though do you think well those people have their
(1:20:49) own values and to them things are good uhhuh so to them those things are good
(1:20:54) to to me those things are bad and they don't meet my values okay got it so then when we're talking about Duty right and
(1:21:01) here's my claim then I think that duty to materialism makes things bad that's
(1:21:07) my that's my claim I think that or I'm sorry materialism itself generally makes Society worse for people to live in and
(1:21:14) so I'm going to try to appeal to your values here and ask you do you think that materialism itself is good for
(1:21:21) society or do you think it's bad for society the way that I framed materialism material Goods can be
(1:21:27) fulfilling that no that the movement towards materialist Goods being fulfilling over other things like duty
(1:21:34) is bad for society I'm not sure what it means to have something like a material
(1:21:39) good maybe you can give me an example of that a material good being over a Duty or something like that what do you mean
(1:21:45) a material good being over well so a Duty or a value of a Duty be some type
(1:21:51) of conception of a thing that you feel you must do even if it doesn't give you any sort of pleasure there's nothing
(1:21:59) there's nothing that you gain from this right generally materialism is the opposition it's the pursuit of material
(1:22:05) things for the purposes of pleasure or fulfillment or something like this right these would be these would be the
(1:22:11) distinct differences so duty is not you know actualizing some pleasure Center
(1:22:16) necessarily so it's a obligation you feel like you have so a good example of a Duty would be like um oh you have a
(1:22:24) child right um that you're in charge of let's say you're babysitting or something like
(1:22:29) that you have some sort of Duty to make sure this kid is fed even if you have a bad headache or even if it causes you
(1:22:35) pain or even if you don't like doing it right the pursuit there is something greater than yourself not just to
(1:22:40) material Goods so this is an empirical claim as to whether or not it would be good for society and it seems like
(1:22:47) you're kind of why would it be imp intermingling well I can answer that question but it seems like you're
(1:22:52) intermingling the idea of materialism with subjectivism so if we say like um well the pursuit of material things is
(1:22:59) good for society overall versus people believing that they have some Duty outside of themselves outside of their
(1:23:06) values or something like that yeah well what I'm drawing is a contrast between
(1:23:11) how people lived pre feminists which was in uh smaller societies smaller
(1:23:17) communities where Duty was something which was focused and pushed on versus a
(1:23:22) modern materialist Society where duty is not a thing which is pushed out at all not by modern feminists at all this is
(1:23:29) the contrast that I'm showing that well I actually would disagree that like
() 
(1:23:35) feminists you know at large or something like that probably don't say that you would have duties like I think that like
(1:23:40) feminists think that like women shouldn't essay other women um I think that they believe that women have that
(1:23:46) Duty whether or not they're talking like a subjectivist or whether or not they're talking like an objectivist or something like that I think that they do believe
(1:23:52) those duties exist um and that is another empirical claim as to like what
(1:23:57) they actually believe but if we're talking about my version of feminism right like my version of feminism would
(1:24:03) say you know like hey I think that you know because of my values I think that you have reasons to do XYZ um I think
(1:24:09) you have you know reasons to go vote I think you have reasons to you know whatever okay so let's I think that it's
(1:24:15) fair for you to hyperfocus on your version of feminism obviously I'll start catting questions with under under your
(1:24:21) version of feminism is this true because otherwise I don't know do you under your view then this argument may be moot do
(1:24:28) you think that women ought have some duties to society some duties in like
(1:24:34) under my worldview yeah I think that women should do things that are good for Society for my values what yeah I think
(1:24:41) women should vote um I they should yeah or they should have the right to vote
(1:24:47) well I think both things can be true sure I'm just asking should they actually go vote do you think they
(1:24:53) should go do that yeah I think that women oh my God like do they have a duty to do that that noise is so loud um do
(1:25:01) they have a duty to that would I prefer them to yeah I would prefer them to go vote so they have a duty to vote should
(1:25:06) there be any consequences if they don't vote no MM okay so there's no
(1:25:12) enforcement of any Duty there no legal consequent no okay so then I guess what Dy should women have where there's an
(1:25:19) enforcement behind it like you don't do this Duty there's a consequence yeah the
(1:25:24) same types of ones that men have so if you have a child and you like you know don't take care of it you leave it
(1:25:30) malnourished I think that you have a legal duty to do that you should be punished and the same way that a man should be okay so that's one example
(1:25:37) okay so they have some ethical duties what about societal duties well that
(1:25:43) would be a technical societal duties maybe I'm not clear what you're looking for oh I'm just looking for um like jury
(1:25:50) duy a duty literally right as his name that's like a civic duty or social Duty
(1:25:56) they might have a legal duty to do that now do they have like a moral duty are they doing something like that's why I'm looking at like is there a distinction
(1:26:03) there between the ethical and the Civic duy so I'm just asking what duties do you think women socially should have in
(1:26:09) society legally or ethically legally or well both actually well those are going
(1:26:15) to be two different answers right like I let's start with legally then okay sure yeah I mean that could be things like legally I think people should be held to
(1:26:21) go to diry duty legally I think that people um should be you know prosecuted
(1:26:27) for crimes I think they have duty not to commit crimes against other people and that's both both an ethical and illegal
(1:26:32) one but the the ones that apply to men generally too so I'm not sure what this question is getting at do men have a
(1:26:39) duty to protect women sure okay I think people have a
(1:26:44) duty to protect other people when they can do women have a duty to protect men yeah when they can when they can as they
(1:26:51) can okay of course and this makes Society good right I think people protecting people makes a society good
(1:26:57) okay do women have a duty to not be promiscuous to not be promiscuous um
(1:27:03) what do you mean by promiscuous having have sex with lots of different partners uh that I'm not sure of I don't
(1:27:09) know if people would probably say no I'm asking you I I'm not sure the answer was
(1:27:16) I'm not sure you're not sure if they have that Duty yeah I'm not I'm not sure if they have a duty to society to not
(1:27:21) you know sleep with multiple partners have a duty not to do sex work um that
(1:27:27) one would hinge on some empirical facts like maybe if it caused like a lot of negative outcomes or something like that
(1:27:33) and maybe like the benefits didn't override those negative outcomes that might be one reason why I would say like okay well you know they do have a duty
(1:27:40) not to do sex work do they have a duty to stay with their husband even against their own happiness for the sake of
(1:27:45) their children uh I would probably say no in a lot of cases why not uh cuz I think that
(1:27:53) infringes on people pretty severely when you're in a scenario like that um I don't have I mean there could be some
(1:27:59) negative outcomes for kids there once again that would be an empirical claim that like the the answer to that would
(1:28:05) hinge on some empirical facts so if I were to give you empirical facts and of course during this little two-hour
(1:28:12) debate it's going to be impossible for for you to go through any empirical data I would give you in a very like wide
(1:28:19) overview right but if you were given facts then that if women did stay day
(1:28:25) with their husbands even if they like maybe fell out of love with him they didn't really like him that much anymore
(1:28:31) right or they really just didn't want to participate in the marriage but they had children with him right and we saw the
(1:28:37) outcomes for children were way better if they stayed even if it was at the expense of their happiness would you
(1:28:43) then advise women to stay that depends on how much of a toll on their happiness it would take I think falling out of
(1:28:48) love say it takes a big toll on their happiness I'm not sure that that's something I can give you an answer to or
() 
(1:28:54) not they have like some ethical duty to do um that's that is probably going to
(1:28:59) be a case- by casee thing like I would have to look at okay well how miserable is this person staying with this person and how much of a benefit is it going to
(1:29:05) give their kids and do they have access to the knowledge of how much benefit it'll give their kids to stay so you don't know if they I think in the
(1:29:12) general cases they don't have an obligation to say because I think the type of um things that lead to divorce are pretty severe and in a lot of cases
(1:29:19) usually irreconcilable differences not severe I'm I'm sorry like it I don't think it's severe usually actually I
(1:29:26) think the things that lead to div divorce or reconcilable differences are not abuse and it's not even money
(1:29:33) usually it's just falling out of love I just or they just don't like this person or they don't like their habits anymore
(1:29:38) or things like this but I'm not sure Rec I'm I'm not sure falling out of love is always reconcilable in fact that that
(1:29:44) sounds kind of force yourself to love not asking it to to reconcile and fall back in love but whether or not they
(1:29:50) have a duty to stay with their husband for their children for the sake of their children because their children get far
(1:29:55) more desirable outcomes if they do right but I I think that there's probably something like empirically there like
(1:30:02) there's probably a lot of distress that it causes somebody to stay with somebody that they don't love and to not pursue
(1:30:07) somebody that they would in fact love I agree it causes them distress that's what Duty does right sometimes you have
(1:30:13) du I'm just making an estimate that no they probably wouldn't have an obligation to do that now you've dove
(1:30:18) into the stats then so you know probably that when it comes to abusive children inside the home of single mothers do are
(1:30:26) you aware of where that usually comes from where the abuse from single mothers comes from for the children sorry the
(1:30:33) children in single mother homes are you the the abuse rates that happen to them do you know where that usually comes
(1:30:39) from I'm you might just have to give the answer I'm not sure what you're asking okay so here easy kid gets abused inside
(1:30:45) single mom home who usually abuses them I would assume the parent or other
(1:30:50) siblings no it's usually see in in these cases most off in step parents in single
(1:30:55) mother homes okay right puts them far more prone for abuse and for all sorts of different things now this isn't to
(1:31:01) say that step parents are bad because they're not right there's tons of great stepparents out there nobody's making that claim only that if you are with
(1:31:09) your biological partner right uh or the parent the biological parent of the
(1:31:15) children that the rates of abuse drastically decrease inside those homes for those children period even if the
(1:31:23) parents stay and they're out of love with each other they don't they don't even really like each other you see this often in religious uh marriages
(1:31:29) religious institutions where they'll stay on behalf of the children the children's outcomes are generally
(1:31:35) speaking far and a way better there really quick in five minutes we're going to probably do a prompt change and then
(1:31:43) we're going to do read some chats okay yeah so continue but in five minutes
(1:31:48) we're gonna let a couple chats come through okay sure how how long have we been gone uh about uh over an hour just
(1:31:55) a bit over an hour Jesus um yeah it takes a long time just to untangle worldviews it does there's nothing you
(1:32:00) can do about it you can stick on the feminism for a bit longer but in 5 minutes we're going to let some I need to have a smoke anyway so that's all we
(1:32:07) have some Zin coming too good oh my god um okay uh yeah so the problem there is
(1:32:15) is I think there would probably be a data collection problem there um when you have people who are remarried it's
(1:32:22) probably easier for kids to report that a step parent is committing abuse versus
(1:32:27) a biological parent a parent a child might be more trusting of their biological parents especially if they're still together uh there might be
(1:32:34) covering up of abuse that's occurring so that I might have some issues with like Gathering that data and actually coming
(1:32:39) to like a conclusion there but I would say that from would something like multiple meta analyses on that data do
(1:32:46) something to Sange your doubts meta analyses on the data that says that step
(1:32:51) parents are are more prone to AB Abus than the biological father sure I mean that's that's fine but there once again
(1:32:58) I would need to see that data I'd have to go through it see what kind of methodological problems exist there
(1:33:04) because I would suspect that the the abuse would go a lot less reported CU
(1:33:09) that that's something that you can't account for if a kid's not going to report it a kid's not going to report it um but you can make an inference and say
(1:33:16) like okay well kids are typically more trusting Kids come out years later and say hey my my biological parents abuse
(1:33:22) me and I never told anybody um and you know sometimes they don't even tell teachers well I mean a lot of these studies are they're they're going over
(1:33:29) multiple decades right and so is the meta analysis sure that doesn't get rid of the problem well gets rid of some of
(1:33:36) those problems but doesn't get rid of all of them I agree not the data collection not the not the issue it doesn't make that type of problem go
(1:33:41) away which which type of problem specifically the the problem of uh abuse
(1:33:47) being covered up or children being more trusted biological parents so that yeah that could be the case I was just
(1:33:52) talking when you were saying uh like children could come out later and you know discuss abuse rates or
(1:33:58) something like that it's like yeah that's true but one way that you could compensate for that is to have you know
(1:34:04) longevity in your study following these same people and then get you know getting back with them 20 years later or
(1:34:09) whatever so that you could make these determinations so that would be one way that you could compensate for that sure and it it it might still not fully
(1:34:15) compensate for it though if that person still is more of their biological parent doesn't fully get rid of I don't
(1:34:20) disagree I was just saying that here there is some things that you could do but I agree right but I would say that a
(1:34:26) meta analysis multiple meta analysis that would at least be something you'd look at I want to make it clear it's the
(1:34:31) claim that I'm disputing isn't necessarily that step parents don't abuse their children more than
(1:34:37) biological parents do um that could be very well true but what I'm saying is one we do have an issue finding that out
(1:34:44) we have an issue of like you know children trusting their biological parents more um but we also have the issue of like the the
(1:34:53) um sorry I lost my turn I thought I'm really thirsty um that might be good time for a break but uh we do have that
(1:35:01) methodological issue um over time it it doesn't really get rid of it though if children still trust their biological
(1:35:07) parents more um and it could be the case like parents are covering it up for the other parent whereas they wouldn't cover it up for like a new spouse or something
(1:35:14) like that or they might cover it up to keep the family together um that could also be a case that I would say would
(1:35:19) cause a lot of issues collecting that type of data okay and it those reasons might still the might still not outweigh
(1:35:24) the type of harm done to the person staying with the person they don't want to be with all right uh Andrew you good to stay just while the uh chats come
() 
(1:35:31) through and then I'll uh I'll go over some other things just for a little smoke break uh firstly I'm going to let
(1:35:36) some of these chats come through guys if you do want to get a chat in at this moment you can do so via streamlabs.com
(1:35:43) whatever uh re is $100 and up uh one quick question for you and some people
(1:35:48) in the chat were commenting uh are the glasses prescription they are okay cuz
(1:35:54) they are casting a bit of a a bit of a glare glare oh my so if you can I don't know maybe if I need to clean them or
(1:36:00) something no I think it's just the natural glare sure yeah they are prescription I will be blind okay yeah
(1:36:07) then keep them on all right I'm going to let the chats come through we have KK 1,23 donated
(1:36:14) $100 are the glasses functional or are they intended to make you seem more intelligent because the latter ain't
(1:36:21) working sorry missed the last streams have to work we all got to work man yeah
(1:36:26) no they're they're totally fake I'm just wearing them to look intelligent thank you KK we have Lucas here he says your
(1:36:33) incitement of violence argument against the Confederate flag is garbage you're
(1:36:38) conveniently omitting the part that use of the flag has to be directed to inciting imminent violence continued
(1:36:45) where he says just one moment while we're waiting for his second one to come up where he he writes in other words the
(1:36:52) use of the flag has to be intended for the purpose of violence and the violence has to be imminent that is right away
(1:36:59) see Brandenburg V Ohio and oh by the way I'm a lawyer I don't know if you want to
(1:37:05) respond to that or I mean there's there's not much to respond to I don't disagree with that I'm not sure if that
(1:37:11) just sure isn't clear okay it is CL donated $200 than you pretty sure you
(1:37:18) could have paid a tree to make her same argument all hails anamorphs Andrew I
(1:37:24) owe you a bottle of red breast having to deal with this she does not even understand the arguments uh she's done
(1:37:31) better than most of them G on what do you like she's done pretty good we have Ogle here she's at least engaging she's
(1:37:37) only done the tone policing a couple times so like that's pretty good and uh thank you CLA for that Ogle

(1:45:38) to get that uh bottle going so guys do you want to continue on feminism or would you like to switch to we have the
() 
(1:45:45) body count discussion and the abortion yeah let's move we'll move the topic do you have a preference on abortion or
(1:45:50) body count or just we'll do body count first we'll do body count okay great um so Ann it's kind of your position do you
(1:45:56) want to uh uh go for yeah sure I mean when we look at um people's happiness
(1:46:02) and their relationships versus like the comparison with the amount of people that they've had intimate relationships
(1:46:09) with um there tends to be a lot of variation in the long-term happiness or
(1:46:16) success of a relationship talk marriages I'm sorry you mean like marriages I
(1:46:21) believe the last time I looked at the statistics it was looking at people who were in marriages so on the lower end of the spectrum if you tended to have less
(1:46:28) bodies um and I believe the number somewhere between like 1 to three um you tended to have less successful marriages
(1:46:35) and then as those numbers kind of um get up a little bit and a little bit those
(1:46:41) are where you kind of it stabilizes you get like more happy more successful marriages or relationships and don't don't site me on the marriages thing it
(1:46:47) could just be relationships um it's been a while since I've looked at that data but then on the other end where you get
(1:46:53) into the you know the higher numbers what people would call more extreme numbers more you know uh more
(1:46:58) promiscuous people their marriages also tend to be less happy so on both ends of the extremes you tend to have less happy
(1:47:04) marriages and then somewhere in the middle um you tend to have you know more
(1:47:10) happier marriages or relationships those relationships are more successful yeah I think I'm familiar with what you're
(1:47:15) citing I think now again don't quote me either because we don't have the data in front of us but I believe that this was
(1:47:21) based around marage and um now are you you're not
(1:47:27) talking about Pew you're talking about I think there's a specific study on I just can't think of what it is I'm sure we
(1:47:33) could pull it up or have Brian pull it up but uh did this account for secular versus nonsecular marriages for what
(1:47:39) sorry what was the word secular versus nonsecular so like religious marriages versus non-religious I wouldn't know we
(1:47:45) we'd have to look at the data because once again I'm not even sure if they were talking about marriages well can we agree that at least according to um to
(1:47:53) Modern data and including uh P research did a bunch on this as well that people
(1:47:59) who are in highly religious marriages they tend to divorce less than people who are not in highly religious
(1:48:05) marriages sure yeah um there might be factors that account for that um like
(1:48:11) maybe it's looked down upon in their culture to get divorced even if you're going through something difficult like abuse um cuz you I mean just to get
(1:48:19) clear on this you think that people who are being abused should leave their partner right
(1:48:25) um depending on severity not necessarily the first order but if there's uh
(1:48:31) depending on severity do you think that people who are being physically abused should leave their Partners again it
(1:48:37) would answer it would depend on severity okay so you think even if there is physical abuse present that someone I
(1:48:43) think that two two people can get drunk right and like a woman can smack a dude in the back of the head that would be
(1:48:48) considered physical abuse and then just never do it again the rest of her life I'm not going to tell that woman to like
(1:48:54) run out on her marriage right I don't or tell that guy like oh you know she something like that
(1:49:01) or uh here's another thing that's really common so um and you see this in just
(1:49:07) normal relationships all the time like a guy will make a snide comment and like let's say they're watching a movie or
(1:49:13) something he'll make a snide comment and the woman will kind of like smack him on the arm you know what I mean or something like that is that physical
(1:49:19) abuse I guess it could be considered that so but it's severity it's it's up
(1:49:24) to severity I don't I don't know that I would call it in a case of abuse like if you're if you were messing around with
(1:49:29) your wife and she like smacked you upside the head as a joke I don't think you would call that abuse I I don't
(1:49:35) would call it abuse I would okay so just for the sake of this conversation M
(1:49:41) actions that weren't intended to be again I think it depends on severity you okay well I mean I think
(1:49:49) for the sake of this we can exclude those cases we can exclude the cases where someone just like iing pushes yeah
(1:49:55) I still think that it would depend on severity like I also think a woman can get really really upset and one time she
(1:50:03) slapped her husband cuz she was so upset or let's say she threw a plate across the room and it broke you know something
(1:50:09) like that I think that there's some of these things are pardonable and you can work past them I don't think that those
(1:50:15) are necessarily going to they could be red flags for sure but I'm not going to tell a person that they need to give up
(1:50:20) on their marriage over them sure do you think most cases of abuse like are worthy of kind of divorcing your partner
(1:50:28) just how to Cu uh well like physical abuse maybe what is considered emotional abuse probably not right we can I mean
(1:50:35) we can exclude it to you know like persistent emotional abuse would be something you would say you should probably end a relationship over right
(1:50:42) yeah okay yeah that's fine we can age wa persistent emotional abuse depending on how it's categorized what do you mean how it's
(1:50:48) categorized well it depends on how you would categorize emotional abuse it's very evasive okay I mean that's that's fine but we
(1:50:54) can just say like you think that the most most times when people get divorced
() 
(1:51:00) over emotional abuse they're usually talking about those like severe cases right like they're talking about like no
(1:51:05) persistent no I'm not I'm not at all convinced that when people say they're
(1:51:11) especially women that they're getting a divorce based on emotional abuse that there was anything other than just she
(1:51:17) just wasn't happy based on other circumstances called it emotional abuse because it's such a nebulous term okay
(1:51:24) that's fine um I might actually be fine with that um I think there's a problem with psychology where um the average
(1:51:31) person has adopted terms that are specific psychological terms like narcissist everyone's a narcissist now
(1:51:37) everyone has autism now everyone is you know BPD now so whatever term everyone's gaslighting everyone I I understand that
(1:51:44) I think there is some truth to that and to the extent that there is truth to that it should be like handled and understood by people generally um but I
(1:51:51) I would say in a lot of CAS is that that's the case where you have like severe emotional what you would
(1:51:56) categorize we can just use whatever your standard is for a severe emotional abuse sure yeah whatever your standard is for
(1:52:02) severe emotional abuse and severe physical abuse you would think that that would be more likely to be covered up in
(1:52:08) let's say like religious families right where there's I don't think it's more likely in fact I think that the reason it works is because you're more likely
(1:52:14) to get help so because you have an ecclesiastical structure in traditional uh church functions you have a community
(1:52:21) which is there that's able to actually assist inside of these relationships uh for these problems that
(1:52:27) come up whereas a lot of other people don't have resources or they have secular resources so so you think that
(1:52:35) okay I mean maybe that's like an empirical claim once again because it's kind of hard to just say that like oh
(1:52:41) well there's a lot of good evidence for this so the the fact of the matter is is that um you I mean you would just
(1:52:48) logically agree with this probably that if you have community which you can turn to for assistance in
(1:52:54) your marriage that's probably better than not having a community to turn to for assistance in your marriage that's
(1:53:00) probably always the case but if that Community reinforces ideas that like you know men are supposed to have power over
(1:53:06) women and in sometimes a physical sense that shouldn't be problematic if within the view of the religion both Partners
(1:53:12) believe that right sorry I'm going to wait for him to do that sorry you're like scaring I'm like waiting for it
(1:53:19) it's like someone's popping a balloon I'm just like waiting you guys continue all okay um sure there there can be
(1:53:26) these structures but if these structures reinforce the idea that it's good to stay with your partner no matter what
(1:53:32) like there are sex of like Catholics who believe that you should never get uh divorced like it's bad anytime that you
(1:53:38) do it there are sex of no that's incorrect Catholics Catholics are under one single ecclesiastical Church
() 
(1:53:44) Authority and the doctrines are uniform across CA Catholicism itself or you're not in communion with the church so that
(1:53:52) being the case their ecclesiastical Authority is going to be an unchanging standard from their view so it's not
(1:53:58) going to change it's going to be and if you're not part of that you're not part of the Catholic church and it would be
(1:54:04) the same thing with like um Orthodox Christians uh you would not be a part of this body Itself by its own
(1:54:11) ecclesiastical rules that's like church politics I mean that's fine you can say that like okay well if they if Catholics
(1:54:17) claim this you'll be all right that was underwhelming was like don't worry I had
(1:54:23) my you like hyped it up I had my hands on the brought it up these glasses are real please don't test that um thank you
(1:54:30) Ole appreciate it I'll I'll get you guys the go ahead continue yeah thank you um yeah but it you can boil that down to
(1:54:38) like church politics like they they can call them like not real Christians or not real Protestants not real Catholics whatever if they choose to you know
(1:54:45) follow this doctrine that say can do that yeah but yeah I mean that's fine you you think that there's some like
(1:54:51) pretty Blasphemous or un cathol I'm not even talking about that I'm just talking
(1:54:56) about so not every single Church Authority has an ecclesiastical or
(1:55:01) governmental structure so you violate you violate this structure you're not a
(1:55:07) part of this that's really clear guidelines for what makes you the thing or not the thing like we have clear
(1:55:12) guidelines for what makes us to the United States of America so there are Church authorities which have very clear
(1:55:17) guidelines to what makes you a part of that Authority if you violate it you're not a part of it that's
(1:55:22) right you can say that that they're not a part of the over like head like they're not under you know the that
(1:55:30) domain anymore that's fine but they're still they have all of the other properties that go along with that no
(1:55:35) they they don't or they would be part of the thing itself I think this is just semantic no but it is semantics but it's
(1:55:41) really important when we're talking about this because what we're discussing is um you know if you're a part of this
(1:55:48) religious denomination and it's giving you kind of this bad advice etc etc um
(1:55:54) should you know should you be relying on them as a community and then when you bring up Catholicism as an example it's
(1:56:00) like well I I want to make sure that you're not STW maning what Catholics believe before you make whatever the empirical claim I'm just saying you
(1:56:06) agree that there are some yeah so we'll do a cheer a quick cheers Ogle thank you
(1:56:12) for the crystal champagne bottle pop Salo salute
(1:56:18) cheers so there I mean there are people who still claim that though they still claim the church and then they go
(1:56:25) against maybe some you know typical teachings of the church that's
(1:56:30) fine when they say Catholic right you think they're just lying or you think they're when they say Catholic I'm just
(1:56:36) saying there's actual specific criteria for what makes you Catholic yeah that's fine that that doesn't change and none
(1:56:42) of my argument hinges on that like none of none of the question we're talking about okay that's fair um but yeah look
(1:56:48) so if these certain sects of Christianity whether that's protestantism whether that's you know
(1:56:53) some weird off-brand Catholic that is claiming they're Catholic and you don't really believe that they're Catholic or they're in fact not Catholic um if those
(1:57:01) people are in those situations where those ideas are reinforced that like you should stay together because marriage is Holy you shouldn't violate marriage um
(1:57:08) you should you know uphold these like beliefs about staying together for kids like you know that maybe their religion
(1:57:15) promotes like um nuclear families and so they hold that above you know like
(1:57:21) severe physical abuse like you you think that that's wrong and you think that that's probably more likely that they'll
(1:57:26) stay together I think it's unlikely that you're going to find uh any mainstream church denominations which uphold
(1:57:34) abusive relationships they don't necessarily have to um overtly uphold them they can
(1:57:40) do it in subvert ways like like reinforcing like telling their members privately to you know keep this private
(1:57:47) we don't want this to look bad on the church we don't want this to look bad on your family it looks bad on God
(1:57:52) secularists do the same thing within their own family Dynamics and be like well we don't want this to get out it could be embarrassing etc etc so my
(1:57:59) whole point though was that if there is a community present right for for
(1:58:04) marriage generally it's a good thing and it generally helps marriages doesn't hurt them and so one of the things that
(1:58:10) we see is that people who are rigorous with uh their Church Authority tend to stay married longer and it's exactly
(1:58:17) because of those Concepts in fact uh that is reinforced by the community that's so helpful to these marriages
(1:58:24) right but there could be Concepts in the in the community like no matter what it's still bad to divorce your partner
(1:58:30) even if they're abusing you because it goes against God's will because it goes against X XYZ insert whatever religious
(1:58:36) reason that they want to give so Gathering data on that is going to be really hard that's that's the only point
(1:58:42) that I'm making here is like Gathering data on whether or not they're actually having a happy Gathering data Gathering
(1:58:47) data on almost anything is really hard there's some instances where it's exceptional hard and that that is one of
(1:58:53) the cases yeah I'm not sure I'm not sure if that's one of the cases like um when we're talking about I mean there's
(1:59:00) exceptional record keeping kept especially by things by like Catholic churches uh so exceptional in fact that
(1:59:07) they kept all the records of like the abuses that happen with underage kids and and this kind of thing right they do
(1:59:14) pretty exceptionally keep records and they do get reviewed by other priest parishes oversights by Bishops all sorts
(1:59:19) of different things and it's like I think that if such things were happening in Mass
(1:59:24) we'd be hearing about them not saying that some Churches may not have things like this going on just like some
(1:59:30) secular families could based on I'm an internet personality I don't want it to get out or I have a big reputation I
(1:59:36) don't want you to you know what I mean same it's the same same exact I age I think that that does happen in in Hollywood a lot I think that happens
(1:59:43) where they go well we don't want this movie to look bad so let's cover up this thing that Johnny prestigious anybody in
(1:59:49) a prestigious position or doesn't want embarrassment whatever so so that the church is not exempt to that so when you
(1:59:55) say like oh well people in religious institutions tend to stay married for longer um there might be some issues
(2:00:02) with that because of the fact that there's this image to uphold for religion itself and for the church and I
(2:00:08) mean they wouldn't be the only ones beholden to it and the correlate there is so strong that the more rigorous so
(2:00:14) here's here's the thing we know this because we can look at people um so
(2:00:20) various churches have different sacramental or religious you functions that you need to follow the more you you follow X
(2:00:27) function the longer you stay married right now is that causation probably you
(2:00:33) know there could be other things in fact there is going to be other things right but it's it's a pretty strong correlate
(2:00:38) there it seems like there's an equivocation though between a long marriage like a long lasting marriage and a happy marriage and even and here's
(2:00:46) but happiness is done by by self-report right so well that's probably one of the
(2:00:51) best ways that we have access to people's happiness yeah yeah and so these people are self-reporting happiness as well in fact women who get
(2:00:58) married as virgins their self-reported happiness in their marriage is much much higher than the opposition and the most
(2:01:04) recent study that I read on that the reason is is because there's no sample size for comparison against that so if
(2:01:10) you've only ever slept with one man essentially you don't know what you're missing if you are missing anything and
(2:01:15) so you're just kind of happy and content that seems like it's pretty good for society it might be good um but you
(2:01:22) could say something like there's wrong under um you know there's something bad happening in like a counterfactual sense
(2:01:27) like maybe you know they happiness level is maybe like an eight with this person that is the only person that they've
(2:01:33) ever met the only person they've ever interacted with um and then you could take well you know there's a possible
(2:01:39) world where they meet somebody who's far better maybe you know they like the temperature the same you know in the
(2:01:45) house all the time or something like that they want the same amount of kids or something like that so you can make
(2:01:50) that argument for everything could okay yeah you could say well uh Andrew
(2:01:56) you're in a very happy marriage and you're very happy with your marriage but there could be a a world which exists in somewhere where you could have met a
() 
(2:02:02) woman who's even better than Rachel and so you I mean you could apply that universally to every marriage which
(2:02:08) exists currently every relationship which exists currently across the board I'm not sure how that would be helpful
(2:02:13) to this right but so remember what we were talking about was the sample size for the individual being very small if
(2:02:20) you've had a larger sample size then that kind of mitigates that factor there so when like you look at somebody
(2:02:28) who has maybe two partners that they've dated before and they're marrying their third partner or something they at least
(2:02:35) have a data set to look at like okay well here are the possibilities of things that I like and things I don't like um and I've kind of been able to
(2:02:41) weed through and have the opportunity of having a more fulfilling relationships with a third person because I have been
(2:02:48) able to weed out you know these are the type of people I maybe am not as compatible with whereas that person the person who
(2:02:54) hasn't had any other experiences and I'm not saying that that's a bad thing I'm not saying it's necessarily bad well it's it's a it's a it's actually strange
(2:03:01) in fact because they would still be at the mercy of the same thing perhaps though if they hadn't gone off and had
(2:03:08) the second or third relationship and had only stayed in the first relationship as a Virgin uh and had nothing to compare
(2:03:14) it to then in an alternative World they would have been much happier by that standard and that's like it's it it
(2:03:20) would be the same thing appli here yeah that's that I'm fine with saying that those people in those relationships are
(2:03:26) happy but there could be something where they are happier once they have a bigger data set so it's obviously with more
(2:03:33) knowledge about the world like you have the ability to pick and choose better the thing like you're more informed on the things that will make you happier
(2:03:40) right well you you become I would agree that you gain more experience in the
(2:03:45) things that are happening around you perhaps but that doesn't necessarily mean that those are positive experiences
(2:03:50) or that you wish that you had know them yeah you they don't have to necessarily I'm just saying that with the bigger
(2:03:56) data set you have more of a likelihood of finding the thing that's going to make you more happy but wouldn't this imply that the data set which was done
(2:04:02) on virgins and their happiness is somehow smaller than the data set which is done on people had two or three
(2:04:08) Partners unless you're just saying well it's it's uh just trivially true that the people have had two or three
(2:04:13) Partners have had sex with more than one person so we can just view them in a different light it's like no uh maybe
(2:04:20) just to clarify I'm not talking about the data set do you mean the data set of people like surveyed like the are you
(2:04:25) saying that you think that I'm saying the no no I think what you're saying is that women who have had two or three
(2:04:31) Partners necessarily have more experience than the Virgin and so because of that they don't know what they're missing they don't The Virgins
(2:04:39) like people who are virgins don't know what they're missing yeah I think they have less of a data set that's yeah but
(2:04:44) but why would okay they have less of a data set when
(2:04:49) it comes to sleeping with more people right sure yeah but why would that be a bad thing right because they have the
(2:04:56) possibility of looking for people or things that they're more compatible with so let's just say like um the Virgin you
(2:05:03) know this person who's dated one person only has access to the data set with this person that makes them like you
(2:05:09) know eight out of 10 happy or something like that whereas the person who's had access you know and engaged in
(2:05:15) Intercourse or maybe had just you know personal romantic relationships with other people they have access to data sets of people who make them like you
(2:05:21) know a level 10 happy or a level eight or a level seven or something like that they have more access they have access
(2:05:26) to more data right that individual has more access to data about what causes them to be happy in a relationship okay
(2:05:33) but again would couldn't I just apply this to anything couldn't I be like well there's not enough of a data a data set
(2:05:40) for us to really determine that if people don't drink gasoline that they wouldn't be have be happier if they
(2:05:45) didn't have the experience of drinking gasoline before we do have a I mean we we unfortunately have data on that
(2:05:53) and it's a pretty large sample size of virgins okay so what's being confused is not that the amount of people who are
(2:06:01) virgins not being confused there is because you're saying the the sample size of virgins that we have
(2:06:06) equivocating hold on hold on breathe yeah you're saying right now that the
(2:06:12) amount of virgins that we have is less I'm not saying that we could have 50 virgins and 50 people who have had sexual experi you're not saying that
(2:06:18) what you just got done saying was what we do understand the correlation between gasoline and people's happiness it's
(2:06:25) like okay but we do understand the correlation between virginity and virgin's happiness and marriage it's the
(2:06:31) same it's the same thing back and forth what would be the uh experience differential there why shouldn't I go
(2:06:38) drink gasoline to know that drinking gasoline it probably is going to make me happy okay so here's okay let's let's
(2:06:45) get this clear first the I will say this the person who decides to go drink
(2:06:52) gasoline let's just say you have two people one who has never drank gasoline the other person is going to both of
(2:06:57) them have the same knowledge about the facts about what that would do to them um but there's also you know some like
(2:07:02) non-zero probability that they could love it live a happy life and love drinking gasoline and that's you know
(2:07:08) their thing which there are people I guess who do but anyways but yeah look so these people the person who did in
(2:07:14) fact drink the gasoline and regardless of whether or not the alchem was good if they hated it if they loved it whatever
(2:07:21) that person does in fact whether that's for the worse or better have a bigger data set to go off of do you agree with
(2:07:27) that sure yeah they but should they do it should they no obviously not because
(2:07:32) we we know about the significant negative outcomes same I would just make the same argument back for this that if
(2:07:38) they shouldn't drink out uh gasoline because we know that there's significant uh bad outcomes for that but your
(2:07:45) argument for they should have more than uh you know one sexual partner um even
(2:07:50) though we know the negative outcomes for that and you say but there's a possibility that they just don't know what they're missing I just make the
(2:07:56) same argument with gasoline well just to be clear cuz going back to the prompt The Prompt wasn't that people should
(2:08:02) have multiple partners um The Prompt is more so about and maybe you can read it back specifically but it was about um
(2:08:09) the fact that if you are looking for a partner the main concern shouldn't be
(2:08:15) the amount of partners that that person has I don't think it main concern The Prompt was you shouldn't care about body
(2:08:22) count if you want a relationship yeah shouldn't right and by by that I mean that that shouldn't be your main concern
(2:08:27) I mean I can I'm allowed to clarify right sure okay sure I think that that's totally fair yeah so you're not actually
(2:08:33) saying that should case you should ever care yeah no you should care in some cases of course yeah like um so if it is
(2:08:42) the case that I have good evidence to support that a woman staying a virgin
(2:08:49) right and she's Rel religious like for instance let me give you an example if you're a religious man right and you
(2:08:57) would have certain virtues which are attributed to your religion sure one of which could be to uh marry some a woman
(2:09:05) who's virtuous and a sign of Chastity a sign of virtue could be Chastity that's a Christianity for instance Chastity is
(2:09:11) overwhelmingly large when it comes to the idea of virtue so you would think
(2:09:16) men like that actually should be selecting for body count right they
(2:09:21) should if the person uh isn't currently acting in that way um so the the problem
(2:09:28) that you run into here is like obviously um people who were prior atheists can be
(2:09:34) reformed they can find Christianity they can find God tot age and maybe they've had some you know Harlot past where
(2:09:40) they've gone out and they've slept with 50 men and done all these terrible things and and extorted people in all sorts of things but when that person and
(2:09:48) maybe this could end up being like a semantic thing um but when that person you know comes to the faith and they
(2:09:54) find god um that those that body count still exists right unless you think that
(2:10:00) it doesn't it still does right so you agree that there could be a perfectly suitable partner for a man who is a
(2:10:08) Christian right and one of the things that happened to be in her past was that you know she had all of these sexual
(2:10:15) partners but now she has you know found Christ so in that case yeah it wouldn't be right for him to consider that if
(2:10:22) she's changed no it would be totally right for him to consider it why why would he consider that because it would
(2:10:27) still because it would still show a pattern of not upholding the same virtues he's looking for in the past but
(2:10:32) not currently but if she's currently upholding those values well your past behavior is good generally a really good indication of your future Behavior yeah
(2:10:39) that's look that's perfectly fine to say but if he has really good overriding evidence that she will never do that
(2:10:45) again that she you know will go forward and be I don't know what evidence he could have for that let's just say has
(2:10:51) some some evidence regardless that evidence yeah if you were to say like he had a crystal ball
(2:10:57) in front of him right and he could see the whole future sure I wouldn't dispute that but that would be baked that would
(2:11:02) be baked into the fact of um of knowledge itself he has pre-existing knowledge this will not happen or some
(2:11:10) really overwhelmingly good compelling evidence it wouldn't but absent that which I would argue in most cases they
(2:11:16) wouldn't have then it would show a pattern of behavior against the same virtues he's looking for
(2:11:21) where he could select for somebody who's up upheld those virtues there's also um so that's fine to say that if he has
(2:11:28) reason to believe that she'll still engage in those behaviors um regardless of whether or not she's in a committed
(2:11:34) relationship with him that's a kind of separate question but it but an adjacent question um because the question is is
(2:11:40) she going to be promiscuous in this relationship um presumably like if you
(2:11:46) take somebody who has like a a large body count they're usually not in relationships with those people no it's
(2:11:51) not well unless disagree I dispute well I dispute the premise here a bit I'm going to quibble a little bit but I
(2:11:57) think I'm fine quibbling on this point so my quibble is not it's not really
(2:12:04) necessarily even a sign that she will be promiscuous though I think it's there only a sign that she's perhaps not
(2:12:09) upholding virtues she doesn't have a pattern of upholding virtues so I think
() 
(2:12:15) that like any Behavior Uh like if if you're a practicing Christian or a
(2:12:20) practicing Muslim let's say they they hold set values for what virtues are and
(2:12:25) just like uh language communication and all forms of different habits which uh
(2:12:31) which are formed in people they're done by exercising them over and over and over again so if you're a person who is
(2:12:38) high in virtue you're probably consistently exercising virtues as part of your habit right you're stopping on
(2:12:43) the let's give a stupid example like you're always stopping on the side of the road to help people or you're always you know what I mean that that becomes
(2:12:49) habit after a while after well um you almost can't help but pull off on the
(2:12:55) side of the road to help somebody because it's so habitually built up in you so I think that for them this could
(2:13:00) be a great red flag sign that wait these habits these virtue habits aren't really
(2:13:06) formed yet especially if you're a new Christian right or you just came to to Christ in this sense these H these
(2:13:13) habits haven't even had a chance to flower yet and if you could select for somebody who's upheld them why wouldn't
(2:13:18) you do that right so then it's not the necessarily body count thing um it's
(2:13:24) more so about whether or not the trend that happened in the past will continue
(2:13:30) um and whether or not that person will adopt to the virtues that you have well that it is body count though because
(2:13:36) body count would be the virtue which is being broken right but they're they're breaking that when they're not a
(2:13:43) Catholic or not a Christian right so they're it's kind of like you're saying like Okay well I want to hold you to the
(2:13:49) standard of this religion where we have these specific virtues um but I'm going
(2:13:54) to hold your past self who's not involved in that religion to that standard and that doesn't quite make sense so there could be and I think in
() 
(2:14:00) most cases probably when you look at people who come to Catholicism or to to the church in general um and they say
(2:14:07) hey I'm reformed I want to get my life turned around I want to stop drinking I want to stop partying whatever XYZ that
(2:14:14) you would find to be like vices um I think that it's probably likely that
(2:14:19) that person um take that as a strong consideration into the relationship you
(2:14:25) didn't actually give a reason for why that doesn't quite make sense though you said that doesn't quite make sense but
(2:14:31) then you gave a reason that actually still makes sense you can indeed hold people to your ethical worldview and
(2:14:37) ethical standard even before they adopted it and you can say based on the
(2:14:43) pattern of behavior pre- adopting my standard you did not uphold to it so I have good reason to believe you will not
(2:14:48) in the future at least as of right now until otherwise demonstrated like we would do with all pattern recognition
(2:14:54) Behavior yeah that's fair so what I'm saying here is that there's overriding considerations I'm saying that like if
(2:14:59) you talk to a person which I I would assume this would be the case in like the you know the courting sense you
(2:15:05) typically don't just like have someone be your girlfriend the next day especially not in like religious Traditions it's typically that you know
(2:15:11) you get to know the person first um so with that assumption in mind I would say that you're probably getting to know this person first and then you're saying
(2:15:18) okay well how much confidence do I have that now that they're part of the faith now that I know this person that they're
(2:15:24) going to uphold these values in the future and are they going to uphold them under the conditions of this religion
(2:15:31) because in the sense we talked about this earlier um they are likely not in relationships with those people so what
(2:15:38) you're asking is you know are you going to stay in a relationship with the
(2:15:44) person that you're like sexually active with or something like that and you have good reason to believe at that point
(2:15:50) perhaps not sure you you might have that as a consideration but the consideration
(2:15:55) of like in the Catholic faith like I said you don't you don't get into a relationship with somebody the next day so it's likely for the average person
(2:16:02) and for Catholics I would say yeah but you see that there's a fundamental flaw there which is yeah that's true you
(2:16:08) don't get into relationships with them the next day but this would give you good cause to not ever get into the
(2:16:13) relationship at all this is the problem right it's like after you've gotten to know the person no no sorry not giving a
(2:16:19) chance to even know the person because you just go okay because I'm a pattern recognition machine right this isn't
(2:16:26) what I'm looking for because there's too much potential for X based on how many of these virtues that you have routinely
(2:16:32) broken right and so I don't want to waste my time with you developing good good habits for virtues again or
(2:16:38) something like this they have good cause to just pass those women up completely well those women have a reason to follow
(2:16:43) the virtues now whereas they might not have when they were atheists so but something sorry goad that's kind of like
(2:16:50) saying you never gave me a reason for you know riding my bike being wrong and then sudden of all I adopt this religion
(2:16:55) where riding my bike is wrong well obviously I'm going to have a pattern of you know doing very wrong things under
(2:17:01) this religion but once I adopt this religion I now have a reason to adhere to that so those women do have a reason
(2:17:07) to adhere to that yeah but the reasons can the the problem with that argument is that the reasons can be as
(2:17:12) superficial as I want to buy a new reputation example let's say you're an only fans model and uh you decide that
(2:17:20) you don't want societal or social stigma that comes with that anymore and one venue that you've seen other women
(2:17:26) successfully um have the stigma kind of removed from them is by converting to a certain religious sect inside of that
(2:17:33) religious sect then they're essentially using that now as a some type of purpose to buy a new reputation whether they
(2:17:40) actually believe in the dogmas of it or the virtues of it or not right but you would say that in like I'm not disputing
(2:17:47) that I'm not disputing that people don't you know go around make mistakes and then like want to Rebrand themselves and
(2:17:54) kind of yeah it's constant right be perceived in a particular way of course people want to be perceived in way in you know specific ways all the time agre
(2:18:00) um what I am saying though is that if a Catholic were to meet someone else in the Catholic tradition um they would
(2:18:08) have overriding reasons not to consider body count so strongly because they know that this person has now adopted the
(2:18:14) Catholic faith or at least they have good reason to believe so I mean I would assume that you don't just like go around thinking people are just like
(2:18:20) lying or well you would think you have a good reason to believe well inside of of
(2:18:27) religions Christianity particularly we have various ways of testing the what we
(2:18:33) would call perhaps the fruits of the spirit or the sins of the flesh or various things like that within Orthodoxy for instance the example is
(2:18:41) all sin right like let's say you have that cup let's say sins could be
(2:18:46) considered I guess equivalent to each other uh in Badness but one sin can fill this cup up way
(2:18:54) faster than another type of sin though it's just as bad right the sin itself the corruption that's left behind by the
(2:19:00) sin could be worse so inside of this tradition let's say if that's the case then a person who has had their cup
(2:19:06) filled to the brim with sin right probably going to take much longer uh time for them to develop good habits to
(2:19:13) not do those same corrupting types of behaviors so it would actually give people a fairly good reason to steer
(2:19:21) clear of promiscuous women right or women who slept with a with many many people when it comes to the virtue of
(2:19:27) Chastity especially uh because they would see this as well though you have
(2:19:32) been forgiven for these sins right you will be continuously forgiven for these sins you haven't actually built up the
(2:19:38) habits for for uh being able to exercise not filling that cup right back up right
(2:19:44) that's the idea there sure I mean I'm look I'm fine with saying that there's
(2:19:50) some people who have reason to reject Some People based off of their body count um now whether or not that's like
(2:19:57) on so body count matters value in in some scenarios maybe this is probably a miscommunication thing or um kind of
(2:20:04) like what we talked about before where people when they say things they usually don't make Universal statements that's true um where it's kind of like okay you
(2:20:11) think that I'm saying X but I'm really saying X like with an asterics and that's why I brought up that statistic about the people who are um in between
(2:20:20) on body numbers like where the people who have low body counts tend to have high failure rates and the people who
(2:20:25) have really high body counts tend to have high failure rates whereas the people kind of in between have decent
(2:20:30) marriages decent relationships whatever you shot that up to things like impulse control and all sorts of other things I'm sure but well sure there could there
(2:20:36) could be tons of things but that's what I'm saying your average person probably doesn't have a good reason to say like okay well that person you know has a
(2:20:43) specific body count and my number is three and my cut off is well I think I think the average person if the average
(2:20:49) person still is following Christian ethics which I would argue inside of this country at least so far it is still
(2:20:56) the case that most people are trying to follow some variation of Christian ethics like that would be the overarching prevailing ethical system in
(2:21:03) the nation at least as of now now that's changing but I think that that's the purview if that's the purview then I
(2:21:09) would say that probably um the majority of men who are within you know whatever
(2:21:17) that majority minority is do have great to question body count and to look at it
(2:21:23) from a virtue standpoint as like look this is really bad right this is a
(2:21:28) really bad behavior and can I bypass this Behavior to go with somebody who does uphold these virtues or do I stay
(2:21:37) and or do I select for this to begin with to even try to Kindle a relationship knowing the amount of work
(2:21:43) that could come into flexing these new virtues you know what I mean yeah like I said so cuz what you're doing here is
(2:21:49) taking um the set of people who are Christian or
(2:21:54) Christian adjacent is um who might want to uphold the same types of values um
(2:22:00) and then you're taking a subset of people who it might be good for them to weed people out for like having a higher
(2:22:05) body count I would just take the men yeah you you don't think that women should weed out for like high body counsel amongst men yeah I think they
(2:22:12) should okay okay I was just curious why I just think from their end well because here when we're talking
(2:22:17) about body count we're I I assume that we were discussing it between should men care about it right uh because it seems
(2:22:24) to be that men care about a lot more than women care about it and there could be evolutionary Arguments for why that is but regardless of that from the
(2:22:31) Christian view yes I even think that women should be looking at that as well like if you're a chased virgin woman
(2:22:38) right yeah I think you have totally great cause to look at a man's body count and assess that as being potential
(2:22:45) behavior for whether or not he just wants to deflower you don't you agree with that I think that that would be a
(2:22:51) consideration if you knew more information about people so it's it's kind of hard to tell there in those cases and that's why I say it's like
(2:22:57) very individualistic and I think well I mean something as simple as just he has a profile where he's like I've screwed
(2:23:02) 150 women like isn't that enough like what more information do you that's why that's why I said like the general cases
(2:23:08) like I I I think your general person might have some concern there um but the
(2:23:14) difference here is like the um cases this is obviously given the case where you're interested in dating somebody and
(2:23:21) they've kind of also affirmed that as well um because what we're taking here is a data set where like people aren't
(2:23:27) interested in dating somebody obviously it's kind of impossible for your average person to like have sex with 200 P
(2:23:33) people you know over the span of a few years and also be in relationships with all of those people so you're taking the
(2:23:38) standard where they're not in relationships with people versus where they're in relationships with people because the concern there would be
(2:23:45) either you know just hooking up with me to you know leave me alone or the concern would be like chea cheating well
(2:23:50) it doesn't increase the probability that they're going to cheat cuz before prior that wasn't cheating right so the
(2:23:56) concern there is them leaving you well if you know information about that person that would lead you to believe that they actually do want a
() 
(2:24:01) relationship something like they're reformed in the faith or maybe they've just changed their standards over time and they've shown you Behavior patterns
(2:24:07) like this this would kind of be like I wouldn't jump into a relationship with somebody like that anyways so why would
(2:24:14) I and like that I don't mean body count wise I mean like I wouldn't jump into a relationship in that manner so why would
(2:24:21) I like jump into them like without knowing their body count that kind of
(2:24:26) thing would come later after I already know that person s for anyway why select for yeah if there if other options are
(2:24:33) available for women who have a lower body count thus at least giving an immediate demonstration that they uphold
(2:24:40) at least some of the Chastity virtue um why not just move and select for them instead of selecting for the ones who
(2:24:46) have a higher body count anyway why in other words if you only have X amount of time to find the type of partner if fits your preferences why not just go ahead
(2:24:53) and bypass this with under the assumption that hey um there's I have good evidence reasonable evidence
(2:25:00) immediately to believe that there's going to be a lot more work that goes into her trying to exercise these new
(2:25:05) virtues if she's a recent convert or if she was a convert before like let's say she was born into it something like this
(2:25:11) and just violated it over and over again now you have evidence to the contrary that she's following the faith anyway
(2:25:16) right yeah that's an additional factor to account for so that's um kind of where it gets a little bit tricky there is the person who has been in the faith
(2:25:23) and then has either left the faith or violated it or something like that where they've shown like a clear disdain for
(2:25:28) those values that might be something to take into account for and that that's fine I'm fine saying with um that that
(2:25:34) body count is something that can be factored in I just don't think for a lot of people it's the main thing that
(2:25:39) should matter um I think that if you meet somebody you shouldn't even be like you know in a relationship with them in
(2:25:46) the first place just off the bat I think that once you get to know them you should have that judement you know whether or not they're good and then you
(2:25:53) can Factor when we're speaking past each other is you keep on bringing up well you're already getting to know them to
(2:25:58) be in a relationship with them right what I'm saying is that if you have this pertinent information why why even
(2:26:03) bother selecting for it to begin with and I do think that you are um
(2:26:09) underestimating how valuable this information is and here's why there isn't that much which you can point to
(2:26:17) immediately uh for the purposes of virtue to know know uh you know based on
(2:26:22) a person's past history unless it's criminal or something like this or gossip right that I can really point to
(2:26:30) immediately where I could say from a Christian world view ah that right there
(2:26:35) shows a lack of virtue right or shows a a pattern of behavior if you doing
(2:26:40) something that you're really not supposed to be doing that's something super immediate that you can you can
(2:26:46) point to right away based on past history that you can ascertain reasonably quickly I can't think of too many other things in The Virtue
(2:26:52) Department you can do that with so I do think it is important okay so I I mean I
(2:26:58) kind of already went over this and maybe this point wasn't like made or honed in enough um because you're once again
(2:27:03) taking the subset of people who are religious who think that those are religious values because you could very well have like somebody who's religious
(2:27:09) who just thinks that it's like a virtue to go and sleep with everybody and anybody as soon as possible um well not
(2:27:16) not the majority minority but yeah sure right but I'm I'm saying that you're taking this set of people who believe
(2:27:23) these particular like values or virtues or whatever and then you're saying okay well some of those people have reason to
(2:27:30) select for people with lower body counts and even then they still have data that kind of goes against that and says like
(2:27:35) okay well with the data you know maybe they are following the virtues but there's actually less success in these
(2:27:42) uh relationships where the body counts are lower no the data doesn't show that with virgins but uh I would have to look
(2:27:49) at the data again doesn't but they don't have that is not the case with virgins they do not it
(2:27:55) does not show a lack of success especially if the husband and the wife are virgins then it becomes even more
(2:28:00) successful right and then there's there's more issues with the methodology there in collecting that data and it's
(2:28:05) not on the I'm not saying it's on the fault of the researchers saying it is one of those things we can't quibble over the methodology that we can't we
(2:28:12) can't PCH major that we can't assess hang on that we can't assess right now we can't quibble over the methodology
(2:28:18) because you don't know what the methodology is off top your head it gives me reason to be suspicious and I think that you that's fine you can have
(2:28:23) reason to be suspicious but I'm just saying that the the data itself at least isn't showing you can have you can
(2:28:29) quibble about the methodology of it and you can say here's what I don't like about it here's what I do like about it that's totally fair um but I didn't even
(2:28:37) present that argument to you I'm just saying I'm taking that off the table because it's not provable or unprovable
(2:28:43) at least for the purpose of the debate but what we can at least logically demonstrate is that a good subset of people do hold the values of virtue in
(2:28:50) Christian ethics and that this body count is an easy thing to ascertain
(2:28:56) whereas other virtuous behavior is not immediately apparent that one often is
(2:29:01) of course well I I would actually reject that I think that it's easier to ascertain information about people's virtuous status like um say they used to
(2:29:09) be a consistent liar um say they used to be a consistent thief or something like
(2:29:14) that well you can ascertain like okay well you know they did this before they were religious maybe they have been a few years clean of doing this before
(2:29:21) they became religious so you can ascertain that that person probably is adhering to the values not only
(2:29:27) beforehand but during this relationship so that's what I I'm I'm saying that yeah but I would disagree I'm not saying
(2:29:33) that they do you think that what I'm saying is that religious people can't or should never take into account people's
(2:29:38) body no no no I'm saying that you're I think that you're you're saying it's it's um I just think that what you're
(2:29:45) doing is you're grading the impact of it lower than where it actually should be graded so I think that it is something
(2:29:51) which is Major that is a portion of men's concern when it comes to Christianity the body count of a woman
(2:29:56) um other things that they could take into account would be um children with other men that would be another good one
(2:30:02) or you know there's all sorts of various uh different things that could show perhaps they're not exercising The Virtue they have children out of wedlock
(2:30:09) various things like this on the other hand you can make an argument well it's perhaps more virtuous in some ways
(2:30:14) because they kept a child and didn't abort it maybe that is in comport with the ethical system but the body count
(2:30:20) itself outside of marriage easy one to point to because it's just always universally in basically every Christian
(2:30:26) denomination going to be considered non virtuous Behavior right it's going to be considered a violation of the ethical
(2:30:32) purview of Christians themselves so it's an easy one to point to and I haven't
(2:30:37) actually heard reputation to that just yeah but there could be other factors you could point to as well it's like
(2:30:43) yeah maybe but I haven't heard why this one should actually be trivialized I'm not saying that it should be trivialized
(2:30:49) and that's like I think there's some Christian men and probably a lot of them who probably should value the people who
(2:30:56) have their similar ideals about like um intercourse with people I I think there
(2:31:02) are a lot of men who are Christian who should do that and I think there's a lot of Muslim men who should do that and I think I I'm just saying that when the
(2:31:09) body count discussion is framed as this is an immediate disqualifier of somebody
() 
(2:31:14) I think that removes all of the Nuance out of dating and relationships and I I think that like one of the Christian
(2:31:20) values is to find Nuance find compassion for other people and I think that you're exhibiting a virtue of compassion when
(2:31:28) you kind of look and say like hey I know everybody's history isn't perfect but I want to get to know this person for who
(2:31:34) they are now for who Christ has made them now and I think that that's virtuous on its own and I'm so just to
(2:31:40) once you know for all say this I don't think that there's nobody who should ever take body count into you know
(2:31:45) consideration I just don't think for the average person it should be the main focus Fus of considering someone as a
(2:31:52) partner okay well then let's move from the Christian Perspective just to the SEC then uh my argument from the
(2:31:58) secutive perspective is that body count would also be a great indicator for you just based on Revolt factor for
(2:32:04) preference so most men they find it revolting that women sleep with tons and tons of men right if they find it to be
(2:32:11) revolting and that's within their preference there's nothing wrong with that and they should select past it so that they're not trying to have a
(2:32:17) relationship with a woman that they're actually revolted by yeah I think um for
(2:32:23) those men who it's like extremely revolting and there's no way to get around that for them then they probably
(2:32:28) should but I think there's a lot of men who unders who if they had like relevant data about um the types of relationships
(2:32:34) they could cultivate with people who have had higher body counts in the past that they would probably and by higher I
(2:32:41) mean we can put a number on that if you really want to um but I'm just talking about people in that like midrange do
(2:32:46) you think that if men had relevant data that they could have great in fantastic romantic homosexual relations with other
(2:32:52) men that they would suddenly have a preference towards having a homosexual relationship even if the data said that it would end well for them some of them
(2:32:59) might lean more towards that almost none you really think that men would go oh uh
(2:33:05) I'm totally straight and attracted to women but now that I see that I could like I don't know have a bigger house in
(2:33:11) a pool if I become a homosexual um I'm going to suddenly start having gay you really think that yeah yeah well yeah
(2:33:18) there are people who do that it's kind of like saying um now they're not there are people most men would not go for
(2:33:24) that right you agree you did I say you think most men would go for that and you're like yeah I
(2:33:30) no no I said that that would lean most people more towards possibly developing
(2:33:37) a preference for that so it's not that most men would in fact become gay like that's I didn't say that or even engage
(2:33:42) in I mean if they find homosexuality revolting there's no amount of data that you're going to show
(2:33:48) them where they're like oh well now that I see that I could get a bigger pool the
(2:33:53) act of gay sex is less revolting to me right I think I have you ever heard the phrase like 20 bucks is 20 bucks I mean
(2:33:59) like come on like yeah I think people genuinely that's literally making fun of degenerates do we say that because it's
(2:34:06) making fun of degenerates you don't think there's actually people I mean there's a whole like um there's actually
(2:34:11) a wonderful sociologist and I will shout out Dr Jenny stuber for doing a presentation on this um there are people
(2:34:17) who who will go gay for pay yeah absolutely people are incentivized to do things when they realize that there's
(2:34:23) positive outcomes for them yeah there are some I I would never put it in a monolith that there could be some men
(2:34:29) like for instance in the adult uh corn industry there's men who have um you
(2:34:35) know gay who are apparently straight according according to what they say right they have to have fluffers though
(2:34:41) come in and you know get them to the point where they can do it um because
(2:34:47) they can't do it on their own right because they have no zero traction there a lot of them even find it revolting do I think that there are some men who
(2:34:53) would sell out for this sure but that was never dispute I'm just saying overwhelmingly no you're not going to be
(2:34:58) able to change men's Mind by saying well you know this could be a positive romantic Outlook that you now have uh or
(2:35:07) you could have a wonderful life with a man of the same sex if you find it revolting that's not going to change most of their minds do you think most
(2:35:13) men are most at least I me the overwhelming majority like I would say like 99 .9% or higher you're not going
(2:35:21) to change their minds sure do you think the overwhelming set of straight men are more adverse to like the thought of
(2:35:28) themselves having like homosexual intercourse than they are to like a woman with a slightly higher body count
(2:35:33) number than they prefer um yeah you think they're more
(2:35:39) they're more adverse to the homosexual right right right exactly so then when you take that into account with that
(2:35:44) you're saying like Okay well look yeah they might be completely repulsed by the thought of having homosexual sex but
(2:35:51) when they're given you know other incentives to do so or more information about the facts of what it would cause for them then they're more likely to do
(2:35:58) that whether or not that amount is in like let me counter with this real quick
(2:36:03) um which would just be yeah I agree that there's I agree that there's a lower
(2:36:08) subset of men who are revolted by promiscuous women than are by gay sex but within that subset of of men who are
(2:36:15) revolted by women with a high body count it's just as bad as the men who are complet revolted by game gay sex it
(2:36:21) would be the same thing the you're saying the amount of men is lower so if you just say the
(2:36:27) amount of well isn't the amount of men who are repulsed by uh gay sex going to be higher than the amount of men who are
(2:36:34) repulsed by women with a high body count it's like yeah but that but that really doesn't mean anything because if we're
(2:36:40) looking at the subset of men who are they're equally repulsed right they're just repulsion is repulsion I'm I'm not
(2:36:47) actually convinced of that I'm far more repul by the thought of like eating dog  than I am at the thought of like
(2:36:52) eating pickles and I really hate pickles um so that you're you're saying like oh you you're you can have like you can
(2:36:58) have that trivially right and maybe I can con concede a bit maybe I am quibbling a little bit but I'm what I'm
(2:37:04) what my point is is that just because there's a largest subset who finds us to be repulsive with gay sex there is a
(2:37:10) large subset of men who find it repulsive that women have a high body count and I don't and I think it's
(2:37:16) higher than your aversion to pickles and I think it's less High than the aversion
(2:37:21) to homosexual sex right but we I mean we can take a PLL of the people in this room like would you rather have sex with
(2:37:27) like a woman who has a high body count or would you rather have sex with a man and I think most of the people in this room would be like I I'd rather have sex
(2:37:33) with a woman with a high body count so that's just evidence in favor of the hypothesis would but it's to the matter
(2:37:40) of degree like I said it's higher than your aversion to pickles right but perhaps less High than homosexual sex
(2:37:47) but this the point remains that if they're repulsed by it and that's within their preference it seems a perfectly
(2:37:53) good argument to say it's not my preference and then just avoid those women altogether because it's outside
(2:37:59) their preference right but just like the case with the virgins what that does is when you say I'm just averse to it and
(2:38:05) and like I said I'm excluding these extreme cases of like aversion I think that those people who have extreme ver you know aversion to this thing that
(2:38:11) like the aversion can't really be manipulated or changed or you know to have better outcomes I think those
(2:38:17) people probably should and that's the same thing that I say like I think people who have like a really strong preference against like eating pickles
(2:38:23) those people probably shouldn't eat pickles even though they really want to you know have a bigger data set about what it might be like deep pickles or
(2:38:28) something like that so the the point stands there is that I think there's far more men who would have you know
(2:38:34) intercourse with a woman with a higher body count I think that that aversion can be manipulated so that their data
(2:38:40) set can be expanded and they can find happier relationships would you apply that same logic to conversion therapy
(2:38:46) then to convert in what way in the same way way that if it is the case that um
(2:38:52) they're opening up their experience to the fact that you know they're uh they could see that their life would be far
(2:38:59) less stigmatized if they became heterosexuals or only engaged in heterosexual sex and that they would
(2:39:05) have far better outcomes that there's a lot of uh gay men who could be convinced as it were to do this thing that they
(2:39:11) found repulsive that's a that's an empirical claim so if you're asking me if I I need uh one final statement on
(2:39:17) the body count question from each of you okay okay well I'll just I'll just let you go ahead and end and then I'll end
(2:39:22) sure okay um then we'll do chats then we'll do close Okay cool um yeah I think
(2:39:27) in quite a bit of cases I would be able to say that you know for most people it would be worth it to consider somebody
(2:39:34) with a higher body count then they have a preference for I believe when you look at the preferences for body count amount
(2:39:40) it's actually pretty low and it probably falls into that lower end of the spectrum where you have like people who are like from the 1 to 3ish range um and
(2:39:47) I think for those people which I would say is the majority of people they should open up the range to you know the
(2:39:53) the kind of Middle Ground where people tend to have more successful relationships yeah well I would just say
(2:39:58) that um my opponent never actually made a really good claim for why men
(2:40:04) shouldn't care about this only that um it's there's a possibility that some men
(2:40:10) can be rehabilitated against their revulsion from a secular aspect that of course that would bring up the can of
(2:40:15) worms of conversion therapy right uh same thing when it came to the revulsion of homosexual sex and then further I
(2:40:22) would say from the Christian sense she didn't really make any reputations at all only saying that yes from the
(2:40:27) Christian angle it seems that body count uh itself would be very important for somebody who was looking for virtue in a
(2:40:33) partner and that she's not adverse to that at all so I don't I don't really understand I still don't really
(2:40:39) understand the position I'm trying not to straw man it I'm trying to steal man it but I I feel like that rendition of
(2:40:44) events is actually pretty accurate there might have to be a further conversation on that cuz there is still some confusion but I will okay yeah um we're
() 
(2:40:52) going to let a bit of chats come through here the TTS has been lowered to 69 if you want to get
(2:40:58) something at the end of the show here and then uh before we do that though
(2:41:03) guys we do have debate immediately after this so if you guys want to uh tune into
(2:41:10) that that's going to be a 2v2 so be sure to stay tuned for that the link for that
(2:41:16) has been posted in the chat and in the description I'm let some chats come through but really quick before we do uh
(2:41:22) if you guys are enjoying the stream like the video if you guys have a Twitch account twitch.tv/ whatever drop us a follow in the prime sub also uh
(2:41:29) discord.gg whatever final reminder on this uh join the Discord guys I posted
(2:41:36) the behind the scenes footage of our last stream with Andrew Wilson here where he was attacked brutally AB you're
(2:41:44) recovering absolutely brutalized are you trivializing trivializing my trauma no I
(2:41:49) just thought it was funny and so you can see the point of view she was crazy she was uh quite the character so uh you can
(2:41:56) do that there also send in more Super chats yeah do it guys uh do it now do it
(2:42:02) so guys debate university.com if you want to learn how to become a master debater venmo cash app whatever pod if
(2:42:09) you want 100% of your contribution to go towards us and we're going to do a $69 TTS I'm opening that up then we'll have
(2:42:15) the two panelists do their closing statements after that we have Ray Bas here with a $200 Super Chat thank you so
(2:42:21) much Ray she says can she address Rachel's point if there's no objective standard to judge morality then it just
(2:42:27) comes down to preferences there's an objective standard for what is good and it is from God a quick response on this
(2:42:34) sure uh yeah there is some problems within philosophy regarding this issue um calling God's standards objective um
(2:42:41) because although his standards are independent of human minds they're not independent of his mind so he still has
(2:42:46) a mind um so his you know stances are are the thing that is good unless you're
(2:42:52) saying something different there and then that would have to be something we would have to get into well can you can you say though just to follow because I
(2:42:59) understand her question is there any good objective reason objective that you
(2:43:06) can a morally objective reason you can give a person to not be a Christian a morally objective reason no I if I think
(2:43:13) that reasons are the type of thing that are subjective right cuz I I take like a
(2:43:19) reason to be something that's like motivating towards an end goal yeah but you agree and motivators are like subjective but you agree that you that
(2:43:25) almost everybody can give people subjective reasons for why they shouldn't do X right sure of course I
(2:43:31) mean they could appeal to some underlying values they have or something like that or point to some contradiction in their currently held views yeah all
(2:43:38) right we have some chats coming through we have oh Dez Nate she won't have as much
(2:43:45) experience why does a woman have to cross the sexual line to gain meaningful experience from relationships virgins
(2:43:51) can have gained plenty of experience before marriage you want to do a response to that she would have as much
(2:43:57) why does a woman have to cross the sexual yeah I didn't um say that I'm not sure where that person pulled that from
(2:44:03) well you kind of did because you said that absent having multiple sexual partners she's depriving herself of those additional experiences so she
(2:44:09) doesn't know how happy she may not be yeah she could have less information than if she had those Partners yeah but
(2:44:15) that's the same argument you would make with poison again right same thing right you don't know that poison doesn't make
(2:44:20) you happy until you drink it right but you have good overriding reasons just like you have good over we can get back
(2:44:25) into the debate unless okay that's fair that's fair there's always like a little bit of back and forth when the super
(2:44:31) chats come up sure we have Lucas here he says you're wrong on the body count divorce stats women with 0 to one have
(2:44:37) the lowest divorce rate The Quirk you're referring to is that women with exactly two bodies have a higher divorce rate
(2:44:44) than and he continues by I'm going to just pull it up and read it then women
(2:44:49) between three to nine body count women with 10 or more have the highest divorce rate that's a study from The Institute
(2:44:56) of family studies sure um I have qualms with the
(2:45:02) Institute of family studies I'm not totally dismissing any data that comes from them that's perfectly fine um the
(2:45:10) sorry it's kind of hard to keep up when it's like separated like that but um that would be something I'd have to go
(2:45:15) back and look at the empiric at okay we have Mo coming in here in just a second Lucas thank you very much for your uh
(2:45:22) streamlabs message if you want to get your own in streamlabs.com whatever just waiting for Fones to come in there's a
(2:45:28) slight delay and she writes pause pause pause there it is
(2:45:34) great debate curious to her thoughts on allowing people on government assistance to be surrogates and if classism is to
(2:45:40) blame is classism to blame on whether or not we don't have money for surrogates
(2:45:47) like is that what the question is I think we should probably give government assistance to people who want
(2:45:53) to be circuits okay all right Fone thank you for that and then we now have Lucas
(2:45:59) coming in with another one slight delay apologies guys
(2:46:04) streamlabs.com whatever your position on body count shouldn't matter for promiscuous women that have now turned
(2:46:10) to religion is delusional and impractical what do you let uh would you let a saved pdf file watch your kids no
(2:46:17) you would exclude them sta your response I think that's far more severe than
(2:46:22) having a higher body count um there's a safety concern involved there as well yeah but from the perspective of the
(2:46:29) Christian you're talking about the violation of The Virtue right these are virtue violations right and for some
(2:46:34) people they hold that to be a virtue that they would consider highly we talked about those cases so those cases
(2:46:40) like the people who hold those virtues very very highly and think that that like I I think look there there are
(2:46:46) people who are justified in excluding people I don't think disagreed there okay all right and then we do have grao
(2:46:53) tag T grafo thank you man good to see you in the chat so the takeaway message here is the is some amount of money this
(2:47:00) woman would accept where she'd be willing to eat a dog doodo no amount of revulsion to an act for a person is
(2:47:07) absolute I think that's very trivially true um if I offered this got what's his
(2:47:13) name griffy out tagged like six million bucks to eat dog I guarantee you he's going to eat dog I wouldn't
(2:47:18) really 6 million damn I'd take the 6 million I can't but I can't be bought it's one of my virtues is maybe is Ogle still in the
(2:47:26) chat we could possibly arrange $6 million like but we'd have to
(2:47:31) stream it though okay the dog stream I mean that's probably against I don't know eating dog
(2:47:38) that's six m is six mli man I mean all right uh guys final call if you want to get uh any ttss in uh if any of those
(2:47:46) come through we'll get them after they both do do their uh close so if I recall
(2:47:52) uh Andrew went uh first with his open yeah so I closed last so you now get to
(2:47:58) go first with your clothes and then angre will close after you go ahead yeah sure um I think there was a lot we didn't quite get to which I wish we
(2:48:05) would have been able to um I'd love to talk to you about veganism well someday momentarily wait uh wait can you
(2:48:13) um Mick can you mute the audio really quick just so I can go over some things privately
(2:48:19) with a guess it's uh the audio mixer sorry guys it's the audio mixer
(2:48:25) you see it on the far left no no no no no no no no no no here audio mixer in
(2:48:31) OBS it's going to be on your I think the right of the screen do you see the audio
(2:48:39) mixer where I'm sorry where are you here the mouse I the orientation is different
(2:48:45) so move it to the left please yeah do you see on the this would be on the left
(2:48:51) of the screen you see the green bar that's moving back bar the audio mixer you want
(2:48:57) to mute it no the other one the one that's moving yeah click that click
(2:49:44) okay all right um okay I apologize for that guys we had to clear something up
() 
(2:49:50) super quick um didn't mean to interrupt you there for your closing statement No Worries please go ahead sorry about that
(2:49:57) uh yeah so I think there's probably some things I wish we could have gone more into depth with um I would have loved to
(2:50:03) go over veganism but I know that that's a whole thing that we can talk about um I think a lot of the things that we
(2:50:09) talked about there probably wasn't disagreement on and I think that that was made a parent when we talked about feminism a lot um and I think that what
(2:50:16) I've noticed that when I've seen your debates on feminism um specifically on
(2:50:21) like what rights women should have Etc um a lot of them are simply descriptive
(2:50:26) claims whereas like my focus would be something like a normative or prescriptive Claim about what I think
(2:50:32) that we should do and I think that's probably far more productive going into the future with debates with people um
(2:50:38) because you can say men are stronger than women they can take away rights blah blah blah and then what where do you go from that like should men take
(2:50:44) away rights should men stop women from voting Etc I mean that might be a better way to get straight to the point um I
(2:50:50) don't think any of the points made about materialism were super super convincing
(2:50:56) um maybe that just hinges on some empirical facts or empiric empirical data sorry um and I think that there
(2:51:03) might have been a lot of confusion with subjectivism versus materialism and maybe sometimes the lines between those
(2:51:10) things weren't clear um CU it also doesn't follow if you take the
(2:51:15) descriptive claims going back to that about real about like you know men that because that's why I made that point you
(2:51:21) know men are stronger than women they can take away women's rights um as far as pragmatically they can enslave women
(2:51:28) they can do you know XYZ whatever they want to them um but that doesn't say anything about what they should do um
(2:51:35) cuz we can talk about that like we can talk about like okay well white people can enslave black people well should
(2:51:40) they I mean then we can have that that type of conversation about like well no obviously me and you would agree that they shouldn't or right at least I would
(2:51:46) hope that we would but that's you know just on me um the the actualizing talk
(2:51:52) doesn't seem to make a lot of sense there um but yeah I think um overall we
(2:51:58) can look at body count I think body count is something that can be taken account in some cases probably shouldn't
(2:52:05) be taken into account or less into account in other cases and that's not to trivialize that I think that some Christian men who hold really strongly
(2:52:11) to virtues should you know discriminate against some women about body count I think women equally who hold those same
(2:52:18) exact virtues to the same exact extent probably should discriminate in the same way but I think for the average person
(2:52:24) they're probably good just taking somebody who's somewhere in the middle yeah all right Andrew if you'd
(2:52:31) like to uh respond well close the thing is is um it is true that we went over a
(2:52:37) lot of uh descriptive versus prescriptive though we did get a bit into prescriptive we did talk about uh
(2:52:45) rights and we talked about who should have them and who shouldn't and that it's not very good for everybody to vote
(2:52:50) and here's why we started to get into all of those things so I'm happy to talk about prescriptives and not just
(2:52:56) descriptives the reason this debate we had to talk a lot about descriptives is first we had to get the semantics out of
(2:53:02) the way so that we even understood what the hell we were talking about what your view is what my view is and then uh from
(2:53:08) there you actually made a lot of contradictions and ended up having to adjust your positions multiple times uh
(2:53:15) based on my inquiry so what you say is well you were you were talking descriptively and it's like well even
(2:53:21) within the descriptives we were going in circles on some things because we're trying to get them ironed out and I
(2:53:27) don't think that we got a lot of them ironed out because when you would see wait a second as I'm navigating this
(2:53:32) conversation this leads to either a dead end or it sounds silly I'll go ahead and revise what my claim is and now a good
(2:53:40) example of this is when we discuss body count and uh you were uh right in your
(2:53:45) opening saying hey actually you know men really shouldn't worry about this here's why they shouldn't worry about this it's
(2:53:51) not really that important and then you immediately began to revise your position based on the tack I took for
(2:53:58) religiosity and virtue you didn't really have an argument against that you didn't have an argument based on the relativism
(2:54:04) either so um you know ultimately I think that what you are considering things
(2:54:09) like oh we didn't get into this we didn't get into that I think you just made multiple concessions on many points
(2:54:14) and you just kind of don't want to admit that you made the concessions which is fine oh I agre that you think that and I'm happy I didn't interrupt you are you
(2:54:21) having self-control issues um so anyway what I would what I would say ultimately is like I enjoyed the debate and in good
(2:54:28) sportsmanship I will say that it was one of the more engaging ones I've had in the last few months I do like to just do
(2:54:35) Straight logical debates sometimes and sometimes I like to and I'm happy to uh go on your stream and argue about the
(2:54:40) meta ethics of veganism if you want I'm happy to do that as well I have no problems with it at all um though I
(2:54:47) think you might get upset about the presuppositional stances that I may take with veganism uh or the and the applied
(2:54:53) ethical stances even but uh I'm happy to do it uh so with that I appreciate it
(2:54:58) very very much and again guys there's not enough super chats coming in there was 10 thou I went and checked there's
(2:55:05) 10,000 live who are watching on just Brian's Channel alone and all we got was
(2:55:11) a little bit of Crystal what's going on here you guys you need to up your game in a big way uh he went out of his way
(2:55:18) to put all of this together it sure was kind of him so uh with that I will uh
(2:55:24) end my opening statement and or closing statement and thank you for the debate great guys and I do want to do another
(2:55:31) big thank you to uh ogul for the cryistal pop these are like $400 $500
(2:55:37) balls of uh champagne so W's in the chat again for Ogle thank you Ogle appreciate that let me just check if we have we do
(2:55:43) have grafo tagged coming here and he writes I can guarantee there is no amount of money that could pay me to do
(2:55:49) something I'm revolted by that applied equally both to before and after I could afford to Friv frivolously spend money
(2:55:55) on super chats yeah maybe those those men were just like less revolted by gay sex which
(2:56:01) is why they would do it anyway who knows yeah I don't saying they would do it anyways kind of sounds like they were
(2:56:07) just going to do it without the pay or whatever but there there are people who are you know get for pay all right uh
() 
(2:56:14) thank you JJ for the Super Chat okay guys like the video drop us a follow in the prime sub on Twitch check out the

(2:56:33) the video kindly uh and I think this was a fantastic debate I'd love to get you
(2:56:39) guys uh both of you back on for a followup so we can perhaps flesh out some of the topics we already talked
(2:56:45) about and then hit on some of the ones that we weren't uh unfortunately able to get to so guys if
(2:56:51) you enjoyed the stream kindly like the video and what I'm going to do right now we have a a subsequent debate scheduled
(2:56:59) for we're probably going to get that going at let me check here at about 7
