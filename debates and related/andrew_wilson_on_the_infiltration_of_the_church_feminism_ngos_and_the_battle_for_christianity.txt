(0:00) welcome to the Friday show thank you very much for joining us today uh Fridays sometimes are a bit of a grabag
(0:07) we have episodes where we talk about uh the current events that are going on sometimes there's so much in the news
(0:12) either with India Pakistan or Russia Ukraine or something else where we're going to dive into that uh sometimes we
(0:17) do the behind the scenes but other times we have special guests and uh we get to talk about some subjects that are near
(0:22) and dear to me and maybe things that you haven't heard about haven't talked about but are pretty interesting so today we
(0:29) get to do that we get to talk a little bit about some trends within the church and uh some of the movement that we're
(0:36) seeing and frankly I'm I'm kind of glad that we're having this conversation because it's necessary and uh it's been
(0:42) kind of long overdue the church in America is definitely changing um and a
(0:47) lot of times that change is for the positive and results in really really good movements in the church and
(0:53) sometimes that change actually pushes things in a direction that we don't necessarily want them to go and I'll be
(0:58) a little bit more clear once we jump into the subject here uh but one of the trends that I have noticed is women kind
(1:05) of making up the majority of the congregations in certain kind of denominations right so in the Catholic
(1:10) church that's true according to a recent Pew study uh mostly dominated by women uh definitely in the Protestant church
(1:17) that's true in the mainline Protestant church also in the black Protestant church it's very true uh makes up a very
(1:24) significant majority um of the church and there are a couple of exceptions to this rule and one of the reasons that I
(1:31) want to talk about that is because men do need to take more of a leadership role when it comes to faith we need to
(1:37) make sure that we're not allowing churches to just not necessarily just be run by women but we don't want women to
(1:44) have to take this role that God has given to men to kind of be the leaders in faith and we need more men to be
(1:50) involved in church and to be going to church and to be leading in church that's a very very important topic so
(1:57) the two groups not really in Christianity one of them is one of them kind of is Christian adjacent the
(2:02) Mormons i'm sorry guys you understand we have some issues right so predominantly male and I think I understand the recruiting brochure there is a little
(2:09) different um you know sometimes not not everybody does the polygamy thing maybe not anybody anymore but you know that's
(2:14) kind of a thing uh that that's a good selling point and then the Orthodox church I think it's something like 60%
(2:21) men 40% women which is a huge huge difference from other mainline churches
(2:26) and obviously um somebody who knows a lot about the Orthodox Church and who is great at talking about it is uh is Mr
(2:33) andrew Wilson joining us today how are you sir i'm good thank you for having me back i really appreciate it absolutely
(2:39) so you can see today I have my battle armor on right no hat to hide a bald
(2:44) spot there's no there's no bald spot i just the hat's really cool okay so but I have the battle armor on today in case
(2:50) this turns into a drag out brutal debate okay god no help
(2:57) no but I I wanted to jump into some of this with you you and I had some really good conversations recently um about this you were on the show recently and
(3:04) uh we thought it'd be a good episode to do for Gerald apologizes apologetics
(3:13) gerald apologizes apologetics it doesn't mean that it does not mean that but
(3:19) neither way uh neither here nor there so Andrew uh you have The Crucible on YouTube we also talked about it being on
(3:25) Rumble and since we're a big Rumble house here I just wanted to make sure is can people find you on Rumble as well yeah they can and uh I don't know who
(3:32) knows maybe we'll get in this Rumble lineup thing i I do have a show in mind for it but um but yeah you can actually
(3:38) find us on Rumble best place that you can find us to support us is the crucible.v videooide that's where you'll
(3:43) find our entire backlog some of the funniest stuff you'll ever see online uh also some of the most entertaining so
(3:50) there you go hope to see all you there go over there and uh follow him on X at Paleoc Christ uh I love following you on
(3:56) X it's a bit of a treat because I think sometimes you just spend your days looking for your next victim uh to poke
(4:02) and not in not always in a mean-spirited sort of way if you watched our Ash Wednesday episode sometimes you have to
(4:09) put their face right back in the mirror to make sure that they understand what uh what really is going on um let's
(4:15) let's talk about that because you and I were discussing this and looking for kind of a a stat that we thought people
(4:21) would be interested in and find kind of interesting and compelling and I think what we found was that Pewat that most
(4:26) of these other denominations most of these other kind of branches of Christianity not denominations but branches essentially are run and kind of
(4:34) populated mostly by women what do you attribute that to uh NOS's and feminism
(4:39) i mean like here's here's the truth so we started looking into this a couple years ago because this actually blew my
(4:45) mind as well nos's there's many NOS's and private corporate donors in fact who
(4:51) allocate large portions of their budget towards the infiltration of various churches around the country especially
(4:58) the you've seen mega churches right Protestant mega churches so I'll explain how this is done they they call it uh
(5:05) clergy training right and so what they'll do is they'll come in and say hey look we want to train your clergy
(5:11) for the problems of modernity you know we'll have professional psychologists come in they'll assist with the training
(5:16) and this and that and what it actually does is it erodess the system over time inside of these uh more traditional
(5:23) churches and they become soft towards issues they were not soft on before and
(5:28) uh so a lot of it is actually infiltration and the second part of it is that feminists see it as a position
(5:34) of power so inside of the these churches think of it on a local issues on on the
(5:40) local level right where are the power bases well you can have local politics
(5:45) but actually surprisingly in on the local level unless you're in big cities your local politicians don't really have
(5:51) that much power at least not influence-wise over people your church leaders do absolutely especially in in
(5:58) smaller towns smaller areas they're probably revered more too i mean like you you look at it it kind of is a natural well it gives you credibility
(6:04) right gives you credibility and it gives you status and this type of thing used to give you preferred seating on airlines that's right and a lot of women
(6:10) actually see that as an opportunity for them to move into powerful positions and
(6:16) uh another reason that this happens is because and okay let me set it up to make
(6:24) sure this is about to get taken out of context a lot of women will ride the carousel
(6:29) for a lot of their life and when they want when they want to reform when they
(6:34) want to reform um they will move into kind of weaker churches where they can
(6:40) kind of keep the progressive attitudes right they can keep the progressive attitudes and what they're really
(6:46) looking for is not being judged i don't want to be judged i don't want to be judged i don't want to be judged well
(6:51) what's really going on is they're trying to uh kind of jockey their faith into buying a new reputation and I see that I
(6:59) call these types of women sewing circle Christians and I I believe that this is one of the biggest problems in
(7:05) Protestant churches uh that there is is that there's lots and lots of women who
(7:10) want to leverage their faith to buy a new reputation and what they're supposed to be doing is falling on their knees
(7:16) begging for forgiveness right and doing everything in their power to create a reconciliation between um you know
(7:23) between their past and their and their faith through humility that's the point right not to buy a new reputation that
(7:29) would be the opposite of Christian ethics right yeah part of I think part of obviously you know the the process of
(7:35) forgiveness is realizing or the process of you know coming to Christ and and having a faith is realizing that you're
(7:40) a sinner in need of a savior yes and that's the whole process of taking responsibility for past actions not
(7:46) necessarily letting the shame and guilt from those things keep you down that's exactly what Satan wants you're too bad to ever come to God why would he ever
(7:52) accept you right but you do have to face what you've done and that apart from
(7:57) Christ that is exactly who you are and you're right you can't just come in and say "Now I'm a member of exchurch and
(8:03) that makes me somewhat holy." And it doesn't Here's one of the things that happens and you'll see this in a lot of
(8:09) dating Christian dating circles a big problem nobody really talks about my wife has uh you know she's been keeping
(8:15) a close eye on it the people who are around the whatever podcast who are recently reformed Christians have been
(8:21) keeping a close eye on it so I have as well but what happens is a lot of these women will come in after having kind of
(8:27) done these horrible things in their life right been very promiscuous this and that and they say "Well why don't these Christian men want me i'm reformed."
(8:34) Yeah i Christ is my savior well they're not trying to take that away from you and your sins are washed away through
(8:40) the blood of Christ but that doesn't mean that your reputation goes with it right and you you shouldn't have any
(8:47) expectation as a woman that you're going to get a virtuous Chad Christian man uh
(8:54) when you have spent your life on your back right and so and and and this is a
(9:00) kind of a a false expectation which happens with buying that new reputation you can't hold that against me i'm
(9:06) reformed it's like well whether you are you're not that doesn't mean that Christian men are obligated to be with
(9:12) you or you know to to do something like this right takes away the consequence for your actions which is clearly
(9:18) spelled out in the Bible there may be earthly consequences to whatever sin you've committed you can be forgiven and
(9:23) you can be saved but you might still be in prison for murder right right or you
(9:29) might still have the reputation of a harlot yeah and the thing is is like it doesn't mean we don't want you in the
(9:35) church it doesn't mean we don't want you with Christ right it doesn't mean that over time you can't change your
(9:40) reputation anyway what it does mean though is that men still are going to have preferences and them being a
(9:46) Christian maybe a lot of them can look past a lot of that type of behavior but the ones who can't they don't have any
(9:52) obligation to do so because you are also a Christian that's insane right but that's part of the buying of the new
(9:58) reputation that I'm talking about yeah well and we need that incentive structure in place so that women look at that as a cautionary tale and go "Hey
(10:04) make you're incentivized to make good decisions now." Yes because if you don't you may end up like this if you can just
(10:10) kind of do whatever you want to do and this goes for men too sleeping around if you can have that kind of reputation
(10:15) then men don't typically seek that kind of I guess cover from church necessarily but it is that same kind of thing that
(10:21) we have like if you have that reputation for going around and mistreating women probably not going to attract the best
(10:26) women into your life to find a good wife and a good mother it might be a little bit difficult but on a much different
(10:32) scale I think when with and when you when you look at the violation of virtues this is this is the truth this
(10:38) is a descriptor of is not what should be you're right that it should be the case that when it comes to promiscuity um
(10:46) that we're not judged as harshly yeah that men should have the same outcomes as women but the truth of the matter is is that women judge promiscuity in men
(10:53) way differently than men judge promiscuity in women in fact there's a lot of women and this has blown my mind
(11:00) over the years learning this that will judge a man as being a creep or a weirdo
(11:05) because they don't have sexual experience by the time they're in their 30s yeah they think well wait a second
(11:10) what why won't women go near you what's wrong with you what's wrong with you you know what I mean what what's going on here is it because I bring the chains
(11:16) and the whips out day one so in Yeah so in some ways they're like the on the promiscuity aspect of it yeah um it's
(11:24) women who are setting the standard for like we don't care as much about male promiscuity but with men we definitely
(11:31) care a lot about promiscuity for a couple of reasons one's for status right
(11:36) uh and I'm I mean that's just the case it it is a status thing the second is
(11:41) because of paternity this is how we were able to historically determine paternity is through uh how promis you know if a
(11:48) woman was promiscuous uh you probably would question the paternity of the child right and so you wanted to have a
(11:54) chase virgin on your wedding night it assured the paternity that that was your lineage you know what I mean the paternity testing has only become a
(12:01) thing recently doesn't mean biologically we're just going to change our mindset on this coincides with the Jerry Springer show roughly yeah right right
(12:09) so um and then you know the the third reason for this is because when you look
(12:15) at status a man who can achieve many many many women right more desirable
(12:20) it's more desirable for women isn't that weird but it's true it's 100% true but a woman who can achieve whatever man she wants is just Norma right very
(12:27) impressive it's just Norma or Susan it's just a normal chick right so no it is true again this is not advocating for
(12:34) that but it is true that that is kind of society how we see these things uh we are going to be rating you guys to Tim
(12:40) in just a minute here make sure you stick around for the entire lineup if you're watching on the free episode if you're not uh and you are a mug club

(13:08) those are on the way right now thank you very much for your patience um but if you are not you are going to be sent off
(13:14) and miss out on a very interesting conversation where apparently Andrew thinks that Martin Luther is a
(13:19) schizophrenic who banged a nun you heard that right schizophrenic and banged a nun i now listen you did say I
(13:26) understand why he split with the Catholic Church i understand or what why he did what he did but he was a
(13:32) schizophrenic who banged a nun where where is that from i haven't heard that yet probably because I'm a Protestant they won't put that in the brochure yeah
(13:39) so well I mean a lot of Protestants actually distanced themselves from Martin Luther because Martin Luther had
(13:44) tons of contradictions in his own doctrine uh including by the way he he venerated Mary so like that was a big
(13:50) deal and it is a big deal uh so did so did John Calvin and all of the kind of Protestant uh reformers all of them at
(13:58) different points said that the veneration of Mary is a natural part of the human condition so you know like uh
(14:05) I I have the quotes for him yeah I would disagree with uh Yeah but no offense to Mary i mean like it's like you're on the
(14:11) fence about like Mary's just like whatever Mary or Mary is you know the influencer of God i think even the Pope
(14:17) when he recently died he before he died he wrote something oh what was it now
(14:23) I'm going to have to find this but something about committing his his spirit or something into the hands of Mary or Blessed Mother Mary or something
(14:29) like that i I please if I'm misquing I apologize it was something along those lines and I just I remember going "Wait
(14:34) what?" like that that didn't make any sense to me at all how come wh why would you need that well
(14:41) what what does need have to do with it well the necessity would be created by scripture saying that this is the process so maybe that's the wrong word
(14:48) for it what I'm saying is what in scripture makes you think that not you but I would say them i don't know what you believe yeah yeah so when it comes
(14:54) to the veneration of saints do you let's well let's start with not don't say saints because I want to go with Mary because specifically saying Mary kind of
(15:02) has the the ability to not just intercession because I understand that aspect well let's start with this was
(15:08) Mary a virgin yes okay so you believe not perpetual though not perpetual i
(15:13) don't think there's any evidence that she was a perpetual what's the what's the evidence she wasn't uh many many times that her sons and daughters were
(15:19) referred to now I know people say that that could have been some other form of relation but it was widely held that Mary wasn't widely held not by the
(15:26) church mostly by Martin Luther yeah mostly Yeah mostly by mostly by a lot a lot of different thinkers in the church
(15:32) did not see the necessity for perpetual virginity like why okay let's let's say that I can argue one way that it is and
(15:38) you can argue one way that it's not and then let's just say that we come okay you you believe what you believe i believe what I believe my next question
(15:44) is okay but why is it necessary for her to be a perpetual virgin what what does it change about the story well okay let
(15:50) us assume not that that's necessarily like the most important let's assume for a second it changes nothing right but
(15:57) the fact of the matter is is that the the Bible is actually pretty clear that this is that that Mary was perpetual
(16:03) virgin but where is that well so uh Jesus was conceived right through an immaculate conception for sure at the
(16:10) birth of Jesus now do you know the history of Mary some of it yes but not sure I don't know all of it so how did
(16:15) she end up with Joseph i don't know that you don't know that okay so she was raised this is my understanding okay
(16:21) people can go back and fact check it and I'm willing to be corrected again we haven't admonished but I'm not an apologist i'm just going off memory here
(16:29) okay so my understanding was that Mary was raised essentially in something which would be akin to a nunnery okay
(16:36) she was very young when she was essentially you know in in a sense fostered out to Joseph okay joseph was a
(16:43) much much older man yeah okay and this was not set up he was not sleeping with
(16:48) her this was she was promised to marry him when she came to an age where she could be married then she became
(16:54) pregnant right and that's the immaculate conception right there is zero evidence
(17:00) that Mary ever slept with anybody anywhere in the Bible anywhere so like
(17:06) you would have to present that that would be the claim right we can agree that that immaculate conception happened
(17:13) she was a virgin correct it would be for you to That's a big bold claim though to make the claim i think both are right
(17:20) huh wouldn't both be big bold claims like equally big and bold that she either did or did not but I think mine
(17:25) would actually be less because why would why would mine be a bold claim i would have no reason to assume anything to the
(17:30) contrary you're making the contrary claim that wouldn't be that wouldn't be typical for the time for any woman unless she couldn't bear children right
(17:38) so there would be no expectation that she wouldn't have we have evidence that she was a virgin when she gave birth right that yes okay what evidence what
(17:44) evidence do we have beyond that she was not none other than what I said in scripture that we disagree with then that would be the bold claim you would
(17:50) be making the claim there you do see the contradiction though right no what's the contradiction fathering or fathering
(17:57) having children like she had one why would she necessarily stop because
(18:03) that doesn't okay but that's a so but that's question probably bad it's a bad debate yeah but that's question begging
(18:10) right so you're like so you just you you're just baking the assumption like she must have just had sex after that
(18:15) why i imagine I I I think it's fair to say that there is no evidence if we disagree on what the Bible says about
(18:21) you know the brothers of maybe that means a different relative what is it cousins is that what people say it could be cousins or there could be another
(18:28) reference there when it's talking about brothers doesn't mean that these are the And I can see that cuz I think there's
(18:34) legitimate debate on both sides about that so I understand that it just naturally as a when I'm thinking about
(18:39) the situation I would think okay I I would assume that if Joseph did die at
(18:45) some age that Mary would have potentially remarried maybe not i don't think so culturally it probably would have been more likely that she stayed a
(18:51) widow and was taken care of that's why at the foot of the cross you know look at your you know son your mother mother
(18:56) your your son right so being taken care of at that point but I don't think that it would be out of the realm of
(19:02) possibility for me to see Mary having other children fathered by Joseph now I agree i would have to have evidence to
(19:08) support that to be able to make that claim definitively yeah right and there isn't any but I don't see the I but I don't see the issue with it being I
(19:14) really don't know both ways yeah well I I don't see I don't see how it would affect affect I guess this is somewhat this is somewhat pedantic but let's just
(19:21) say inside of the tradition of the church right for all of church history until until the reformers came along
(19:28) Mary was indeed considered perpetual virgin she was the perpetual Theotocos the perpetual virgin so I don't know why
(19:35) Martin maybe it's because Martin Luther liked to bang nuns i don't know and he just assumed that she must have you know
(19:41) what I mean like maybe that was it i don't know but there's very little competition for that space let's just be honest it's true
(19:48) so you know um again like if you wanted to have somebody who could really dive
(19:54) into this specificity of like of these types of minutiae claims inside of theology what
(20:00) you would want to do is fly out Jay Dyer he's the best Orthodox Christian apologist on planet Earth right and this
(20:07) is all he does all he does is dive into orthodox theology um but for for like
(20:12) the minutia of those kinds of claims right they are outside the realm of my stupid Irish political mind
(20:20) well and I you know this is this is one of those things that I I don't want to get hung up on so many of the details
(20:25) but I think it's a good question to help people answer because my natural question for all of the conversations
(20:31) that we have had is what drew you to orthodoxy what is what is drawing you know people to this these males to
(20:38) orthodoxy well so I came to religion a different way uh you know I was raised a
(20:44) non-denominational uh Christian essentially okay and I think like most people you could call
(20:50) that like cultural Christianity more than anything unfortunately the vast majority I really did think that I had faith right but I just thought that you
(20:58) know you just you just do the Jesus thing right you know Jesus Christ is the Lord and Savior you're done you're a
(21:04) Christian that's it right well that's not the case and I don't
(21:09) know why and I think perhaps it is a satanic veil which is put over people's eyes that I never really desired to take
(21:17) the time to look into my faith any more than that that was it that's all you need right it's all about faith and if
(21:22) you have it you're going to heaven and if you don't you're going to go cook right those that's right next to Jeffrey
(21:28) Epstein apparently yeah this is the Well I mean this is the presentation which is given to I think most people well it you
(21:35) and I agree up until this point like Protestant and I grew up in the Protestant church i went to a Catholic university um you and I both have our
(21:42) issues with Catholicism we love Catholic people but we we have some issues with just how it's kind of um put together
(21:48) structurally in the Protestant church there are far too many churches that give you about a 15minute sermon and in
(21:54) that sermon they don't really have much time to go into depth because about five of it is taken up by a story about what the pastor did that week to kind of set
(22:00) up the lesson and so really you're left with a lot of worship a lot plate and 10 minutes of stuff a lot of
(22:06) sports analogies too exactly well and the thing is this is this is one of my big problems with the way in which
(22:13) evangelism is done it's done from the perspective of like like I heard a guy
(22:19) he was he was on it was TP USA and he had like an ihe heart Jesus shirt and he his whole ministry is talking about how
(22:25) he man I was down and out and one night I was in a waffle house when Jesus Christ appeared to me like then I'm like
(22:33) look now maybe that maybe like maybe that works maybe that works for some people you know what I mean but like a
(22:39) guy like me or I think most normal guys like me who are pretty reasonable pretty rational people are like got up you know
(22:45) you just didn't appear to you at a coffee shop you know healthy skepticism I think is what you'd say healthy skep
(22:51) so for me I guess I had to come to this logically first right i had to actually
(22:57) come to the idea logically that there had to be a god and then through the impossibility of the contrary which god
(23:04) and why right and so for me the logical form came first the faith came second
(23:09) interestingly enough I've actually had Protestants criticize me for this and say "That's not right it should be
(23:16) through only faith that you came through this." Right i remember asking talk to God about that yeah i remember asking an Orthodox priest and he was like "People
(23:23) come to God in the the most bizarre ways you could ever think of which maybe
(23:28) includes being at a Waffle House one night." Yeah you know what I mean and maybe you know what I mean they It's in
(23:34) the most bizarre ways possible i've always thought that it's fine to make logical arguments for the existence of
(23:39) God and logical re reasoned arguments for why you should believe in Christianity and I think that that
(23:45) reaches people in a way that often times the rhetoric of faith does not and the faith comes after the acceptance right
(23:52) it's a reasonable faith that we have and you have to be I I think you I have so much criticism of the
(23:59) Protestant church but I love being Protestant for very for very specific reasons i understand the shortcomings
(24:06) though because I've been in churches where the shortcomings are very obvious and you can go to the extremes and you know the snake handler churches and
(24:12) stuff like that like it breeds that kind of stuff where you're like where in the world did you guys like isolate one verse on Paul's journey and think that
(24:18) that should be the norm in church i saw a video recently of a guy got bit right here and blood's
(24:23) pouring down his face and he's like throwing up i don't know if it was staged but it looked hilarious that's ex Jesus exesus absent normative authority
(24:30) and that's why you have Don't you go to authority that's why you have 8,000 different Protestant sex is because
(24:36) there's no normative authority for Protestants and Martin Luther you know a lot of that was a big land grab right
(24:42) big land grab which was being done and a lot of those guys got a lot of social status including Calvin and Martin
(24:49) Luther and a lot of the Protestant killed Martin Luther like there was some risk to doing this well you know so I
(24:55) mean I the status thing yes it did come but he literally could have been killed for going against the Catholic Church
(25:01) well the thing is is like he wasn't and he had he had a very he had a very
(25:06) influential merchant father who was able to get him out of trouble he was a very wealthy guy okay he had some status and
(25:13) it's like I don't think he really ran as high a risk as as it's being presented
(25:18) you know what I mean this was a his dad had some influence and I don't think that the the church burning Martin
(25:25) Luther would have gone over very well at the time so they burned a lot of people a bad thing they did burn a lot of people but they they weren't really Well
(25:32) not not actually at that time they weren't really burning that many people they burnt a lot of people before that
(25:38) before that yeah so I mean if you're looking at the uh the big witch witch burnings in Europe Yeah it'd be like
(25:45) what 13th through 15th century roughly the witch hunt essentially well like if
(25:51) you look at what was the Inquisition what were the years for the Inquisition i don't know i was told there'd be no
(25:56) math yeah i mean I know the Spanish Inquisition i know that time period i know kind of
(26:01) yeah the Catholic Church has done some very very very very bad thing i'm just going
(26:07) to be honest like you have to be honest with your history you've had some very bad popes you've had some very weird situations where people have bought the
(26:13) papacy you've had two different popes that have excommunicated one another at one time you had a pope that dug another pope up and put him on trial really the
(26:19) bones i think I remember this now yeah he dug a Well he dug a pope up and he put him on trial uhhuh and then they
(26:25) convicted him and then they buried him again yeah what's the point and then and then later that was overturned so
(26:36) Well did they at least dig him up for the overturning i mean come on later later that was overturned so look there
(26:43) was also popes who communed with demons openly there's not there's no doubt they It was Game of Thrones in some ways i'm
(26:49) There was popes who who had a big fascination with the demonic i'm not a Roman Catholic no you're not and I don't
(26:55) want to paint you with that brush orthodox Christian okay i'm not a Roman Catholic we reject the uh the Pope alto
(27:01) together the thing is though I'm now I got to run defense for Catholic why did you make me do this okay so I I I do
(27:09) like Catholics they're very close to to Eastern Orthodox and they have like they
(27:15) have a very rich kind of detailed history and in their defense I've argued
(27:20) with Catholics many many times and they they bring up this point yeah you're right catholics have done a lot of bad
(27:26) things i mean a lot of bad things but they were the entire world also and you know what that's a really good point so
(27:32) here's what happens when you look at at uh the idea of like a hotel host things like this the Catholic Church were were
(27:39) the largest supplier of liquor in the world the largest which existed they made all the wine for and basically
(27:46) their influence in Europe was all of Europe it was this giant organization i
(27:51) mean massive with huge government bodies ecclesiastical authorities um they were
(27:56) influencing kings and kingdoms all the way down to Vic counts and and earls and you know land owners and things like
(28:03) this was a ma so of course it there's going to be tons of bad actors in that
(28:08) it's a it's a massive multi-country organization right but if you look for
(28:15) the most part mo most Catholics priests actually were doing what they were supposed to do most Catholic clergy were
(28:21) doing what they were supposed to do but there was a lot of them who would live very wealthy lives and obviously were in
(28:27) it for land and this and that and all sorts of different things but you got to kind of look at it from the perspective
(28:32) of yeah but they were in the that was the whole known world and Catholics
(28:37) basically ran it so I and I agree i I think there's we we can get into the the
(28:43) topic a little bit later but there's there's something about what Jesus came to overthrow that seems to be alive and
(28:50) well in religion in general but specifically within religions that have
(28:56) a lot of hierarchy it seems to lend itself more to that and I think it's that natural thing it's like it's run by men it is just run by fallible human
(29:03) beings that will over time and with great enough numbers have a bunch of bad actors potentially in the midst do you
(29:09) think Jesus rejected hierarchy no not out not out of hand he set it up like he you know we got our system of governance
(29:15) in hierarchy from that i completely agree with that what he was saying is like listen you you guys have made this
(29:21) about stuff that it's not about yeah your heart's not even anywhere near where I want it to be and you've
(29:26) perverted what I've sent i think that's very possible to happen again well this because the idea was the the Pharisees
(29:33) were trying to get the spirit of God back to the temple and the way that they were trying to do this was by trying to
(29:39) follow the letter of the law so that's why they would take you know 10% of their garden for sacrifice and things
(29:46) like this what Jesus was pointing out is like you're hypocrites though because at the same time you're you know you're
(29:53) basically running to the letter of the law you're missing the spirit of it otherwise why would you be fasting in
(29:59) such a way where people would notice you're fasting why would you be cutting your you know your sacrifice off in such
(30:05) a way where it's demonstrated to everybody you're taking it to sacrifice it right yeah he he's pointing out that
(30:12) the that these Pharisees are not following the spirit of what the law is
(30:18) so in the military there's a term you've probably heard it malicious compliance mhm what does malicious compliance mean
(30:24) i don't know the specific definition but it seems like I'm doing what I'm supposed to do but yeah malicious compliance means you're given an order
(30:31) and you follow it to the letter but not what the spirit of the order was you
(30:36) know what I mean and it can get you in a lot of trouble malicious compliance can get you in a lot of trouble there is an
(30:42) expectation that there's a spirit to what somebody says not just the the kind of like lawful order of what they say so
(30:48) if I asked you "Hand me that pin." You know what I mean and you picked up the
(30:53) pen right and you said "Oh I can't hand it to you because I'm way over here." It's like "Okay yeah you're supposed to get up and bring it over here right?"
(30:59) That's what I meant by that yeah you understood the spirit of what I'm asking but you're like well I'm only going to
(31:04) follow the uh kind of the form of only to the letter of what you said and and
(31:10) that's that's missing christian ethics is is pluralistic in fact there's many different ways like let me give you an
(31:17) example is it disrespectful in Japan to go into your parents house with your
(31:22) shoes on i would imagine yeah so that's not honoring your mother and father right right but is it disrespectful to
(31:28) do in the United States no so wait a second so then we can both wear our
(31:34) shoes indoors and not wear our shoes indoors and it can be disrespectful and not disrespectful well that's a cultural
(31:40) thing but yeah it's a cultural thing so I guess honoring thy mother and father
(31:46) actually has some type of like cultural aptitude to it then doesn't it yeah but I mean you're talking about the Hebrew
(31:51) culture that was given this so there shouldn't have been much like need for understanding on how to honor your mother and father yes you have to define
(31:57) what that means just like you have to define what is the Sabbath what is work like I get you're getting very
(32:02) legalistic though right no no no i get it yeah what about what about pluralism the idea of pluralism is that honoring
(32:08) your mother and your father there's a spirit to that which Christians understand that it's not a legalistic p
(32:15) perception right there's a spiritual perception and we as Christians are supposed to be able to identify what
(32:21) that is we could not actually define what honoring your mother and your father looks like in my household gonna
(32:26) be way different how my kids honor me than in your household you know what I mean but who who's the determiner here
(32:33) well but I still think in in spirit you could say you could agree that's how his kids honor him even though that's not
(32:40) how my kids honor me yeah as long as you received that honor like Yeah that's right that's right so so then that
(32:46) infers pluralism or the idea that there's many different ways to get to what the ethic is to what the actual
(32:52) thing is that we're trying to get to yeah and that was that was what was missing right that's
(32:58) what upset and called them vipers and and whitewashed tombs and taking
(33:03) advantage of people too by keeping these burdens on them that Christ never did and I think that's one thing that
(33:09) structure and hierarchy over time can unintentionally do and assume the best
(33:15) of intentions and that can be in the let me just let me just finish this it could be this could be in the Baptist church denomination as well like no drinking
(33:22) well hold on jesus never said that Jesus made wine jesus had wine like you can
(33:27) say that it is good that we don't drink because we don't want to be a slave to anything on earth right i don't want anything to be a master over me fine
(33:34) making it a proclamation that's a problem for me because that's not what scripture says
(33:39) we have to hold those things loosely and so that's I I don't it also defeats the purpose of legalism which is or or
(33:47) pluralism in Orthodox we have a concept called economia if you're in Greece
(33:52) right the customs of Greece are going to be different than the customs of Russia right the divine liturgy is going to be
(34:00) done the exact same way in both places but the customs in which people engage with each other and things like this are
(34:05) going to be and Paul talks about this right he talks about the distinction in customs between the pagans and you know
(34:11) and this type of thing so but the but the idea here is just look because there's different customs how you honor
(34:17) people in Russia is going to be different than how you honor them in Greece and this and that but we can never veer away from the teachings of
(34:23) Jesus Christ but at the same time we can still adhere to cultural customs which don't defeat those things alcohol is one
(34:29) of those things so is smoking that's one of those things right i don't think you're pro right i don't think it's Yeah
(34:35) i don't think it's particularly socially acceptable uh in modernity in the United
(34:40) States to like smoke inside of a church right no but inside some Asian nations
(34:45) it's probably fine right some coffee yeah and are you going to go in there and be like "Hey hey that's not very
(34:53) Christian of you." Right that would defeat the whole purpose that would make you the very Pharisee that you're trying
(34:59) to condemn right that's the whole point of it it's the same thing with alcohol orthodox is called the drinking man's religion interestingly enough though
(35:07) Hold on you're making me really want to dive into this thing just a little bit more interestingly it's just like with Catholics they drink plenty yeah but
(35:13) we're also taught to abstain for long periods of time from things like this during during Lent and during you know
(35:19) all sorts of different fasting days so what it's showing you is moderation the alcohol itself of course Jesus turned
(35:25) water into wine first miracle lots of wine by the way for a party by the way for a party yes at the end of a party
(35:31) yeah yeah it was for a party so the thing is is like look um these this is not the point and principle of
(35:37) Christianity at all is to go in and tell people oh hey you're drinking vodka that's not very Christian smoking a
(35:43) cigarette that's not very Christian you know what I mean that's not the that's not the point in the principle at all no
(35:48) I I agree 100% i I just have this like worry I guess because there are
(35:56) things that I disagree with in Catholicism and I just maybe maybe this is a flaw in my logic for this because I
(36:01) haven't looked into it i look at man-made structure with a lot of skepticism when it involves the church
(36:07) to some degree I think it's necessary and I'm not 100% sure where the line is for me i'm not sure where it goes from being necessary for structure and order
(36:14) and consistency to going to like okay now this is getting so unmanageable that I'm not sure that I even believe it and
(36:20) I think I take a lot of what I've seen in Catholicism and I just place it on any structure that gets too big i'll take the let me give you the other
(36:25) example in Protestantism with the the Baptist denominations i've taken a lot
(36:31) of what I've seen of the hierarchy i went to a Baptist church that was great but I've heard a lot about the Baptist
(36:37) denomination the people that are in charge and kind of the things that they push to other people and it's like yes but that's not from scripture so I don't
(36:43) know where that line is for me but I have a healthy skepticism I think well it's impossible to have a universal
(36:50) singular church without an ecclesiastical authority hierarchy and tradition otherwise you could not enter
(36:56) into what I'm talking about with economia we could not accommodate Greece and Russia and Romania and everybody
(37:04) else under the same church fun because how how could you do it without understanding the rigors the rigorism of
(37:10) the religion and tradition right so if there's deviation from tradition it's not the same church you don't have the
(37:17) same church like if we start going oh okay drink grape punch drink grape punch
(37:23) okay and eat this cracker that's the same as the Eucharist no it's not the same as the Eucharist which is a divine
(37:30) it's a divine mystery and part of the uh foundational structure of the church
(37:35) which is supposed to be done weekly right this is not so if you stray from that what happens then your man-made
(37:42) institution that you're so upset about which has kept this in order for 2,000 years you've actually split it now into
(37:48) 8,000 man-made institutions all of them waring against each other in a very tribal way all based on this they become
(37:55) the arbiter of God they become the ultimate arbiter their ex Jesus becomes the ultimate ex Jesus because who can
(38:02) argue with you no I agree we talked about this yesterday you basically individualize Christianity to where this
(38:07) person says this and so how can I tell you that you're wrong yeah how and I understand that but I don't it doesn't
(38:12) mean that the other way for me like ties everything together look that's a copout that that that annoys me a little bit a
(38:19) little bit of it annoys me okay i don't before you divert to like what about you
(38:25) right m what about the other way what about this it's like a lot of people like to do that they like to defer over
(38:31) before they answer for it first like answer for it how do you reconcile the
(38:36) fact that if you crack open a Bible and you exedute text right or a tradition or
(38:41) something like that differently than somebody else why should I go with you instead of him i'm not saying that I
(38:47) should be able to convince you one way or the other i think there are very few things that make up Christianity very few things that you must have the
(38:53) divinity of Christ is one of those things right very very few things outside of that you have some things that are very important but you can
(38:59) still have a lot of things though meaning like you'll have something but not Christianity yeah of course right I
(39:05) think there's very few things like the trinity though yeah but but but when you're talking about doctrine itself
(39:12) well give me an example of something that we could disagree over where you'd say well I'll turn to scripture and say this can people twist scripture
(39:17) absolutely but I have the Holy Spirit you have the Holy Spirit that's supposed to help us interpret scripture that doesn't mean that's the only thing but
(39:23) that's supposed to help us Here let me give you an easy one okay uh I feel like this isn't going to be easy but it's
(39:29) going to be easy look look look look look super easy are Christians allowed to defend themselves yes show me in the
(39:36) Bible where it says we can jesus said to get swords g Jesus said "Sell your cloak and get a sword." Yeah but then also
(39:43) said not to use the sword he didn't say not to use it he said put it up not right then not right then but he did say
(39:48) that was a specific instance right then he said there are consequences if you live by the sword you die by the sword too so I understand that but that's fair
(39:54) okay I can I can completely understand that but then what about the sermon on the mount in Matthew where he says if
(40:00) your enemy right slaps your cheek give him your other one and that was a demand
(40:06) for equality and you should pray you should pray for your enemy cuz it heaps coals on his head right you should and I
(40:11) mean I'm saying these are there's more to the story than just that i agree there's more to the story but these are
(40:16) actually pretty fundamental ideas just the idea there are whole denominations of Christians which are pacifists
(40:23) because of the teachings of Jesus Christ and the misconring of them and you say I
(40:28) agree with you by the way that Christians can defend themselves of course they can defend themselves my point some people don't yeah exactly
(40:34) right and that's why you need a normative authority you have to have a normative authority of a church and the rigors and customs of all traditional
(40:40) Christianity otherwise you end up with that you end up with um with or or or
(40:47) polygamy right polygamy with polygamy that's an that Well that's an easy one
(40:52) we like we point we point to we point to Paul right and we say okay so Paul says
(40:59) uh you know to to take a wife if you if you can't control you know your loss take a wife we point to that and say well see that's monogamy right but
(41:06) polygamists will point to uh the parables of Jesus Christ at the wedding where he says you know he's going down
(41:12) for multiple brides so and they say "See that's polygamy." They were they were all for polygamy and polygamy at the
(41:18) time was just fine yes but so here's here's the problem that I have you're about to give me normative authority maybe maybe the problem that I have with
(41:26) that is that you can twist scripture if you want to but scripture does inform scripture and so you can use it to
(41:32) confirm like okay so you say the Jesus thing can you point to I I don't even I wouldn't concede that point but the
(41:39) great thing about the Bible is that Jesus or God spread the message over all
(41:44) of the available bandwidth it's a great thing to do in the military if you have an enemy jamming your signal you want to spread your message over the entire
(41:50) bandwidth that way if any of it's jammed it can still get through yeah rip a page out of the Bible tell me what you've lost doesn't matter the page you've not
(41:57) lost something that is fundamental to Christianity by ripping one page out so what that tells me is that God makes
(42:04) this point over and over through symbolism through you know stuff being fulfilled from the Old Testament to the
(42:09) New Testament patterns being set up from the Old Testament to the New Testament being fulfilled in Jesus in different letters it's spread throughout the
(42:16) available bandwidth you would have a really hard time saying "Hey I found one
(42:21) thing in the Bible that another part of the Bible doesn't inform me on." And be able to end up that far a skewed but
(42:27) people do this and say "I found my verse i'm going to build my church on that yeah I'm a snake handler now but they
(42:33) but in order for you to do this you would have to appeal to a normative authority in this case you scripture well okay scripture informed scripture
(42:41) yes who's who's reading it the people this is what Paul said in Acts 17:11 right hang on you're reading it right
(42:46) sorry you're reading it i'm reading it with you so you're the interpreter theoretically yes so who's the normative
(42:53) authority i'm reading the scripture right here you can argue what it says but here's the thing what if you're
(42:59) wrong what if you guys are wrong my question to you what if it's the same thing with the Orthodox Church you guys
(43:05) split from Catholicism right there was Catholicism split from us oh come on there's no come on they split from us
(43:11) fine they split from you guys because they didn't think you were doing it right they would make the same argument that's because they decided that they
(43:16) were going to make a bishop into a pope and we said you're not allowed to do that right they thought that's totally
(43:22) fine you guys said that's not totally fine yeah so they Yeah so there was a schism they schism they would levy the
(43:28) same criticisms against you so I have two structural levy the criticism and normative authority though in fact no
(43:33) they wouldn't the Roman Catholics you guys would both leverage that against the Roman Catholics would say that um
(43:39) like I can go and take uh you know the the Roman Catholics when they do their
(43:44) version of the Euchar I could go take that tomorrow I don't have to be baptized as a Roman Catholic they they
(43:50) concede that the Orthodox are correct their Christologology is correct and our lurggical doctrines are correct they
(43:56) concede that point we don't concede their points right we don't want
(44:01) reconciliation with Rome they want reconciliation with us we don't want reconciliation with them so no they're I
(44:08) would not get attacked on my christologology by Roman Catholics that's not not the case or on lurggical
(44:14) doctrine from Roman Catholics it would only be Protestants who would be attacked so there's a great meme on this
(44:19) i just posted it the other day it's a funny one says "When when I'm making fun of Roman Catholics," and it shows like
(44:26) the guy smiling and he says "But when Protestants are making fun of Roman Catholics," and then the guy's all angry looking right and it's like "So so the
(44:34) thing is it's like um we we we're like we're like brothers who are fighting you
(44:39) know what I mean but you're like the annoying neighbors who need to get kicked you know what I mean you're like the annoying neighbor we're like "This
(44:44) is our fight don't get in the middle of our fight this is our fight it's not for you we're way too good for you." You
(44:51) know what I mean all of us I mean listen not all of us are bad no no no well look
(44:57) my parents my parents are prot like I get asked this all the time are your parents going to hell i'm like I hope not you know I hope not they're
(45:03) Protestants but our conception even if I I hope you know that you can more than hope not well listen I'm not my
(45:09) normative says you can hope we would never make the uh salvific claim like I
(45:15) remember a priest was saying uh I went to this event called the Orthodox montanica great event and there was a
(45:22) priest there and a guy asked him the question he was like "Look you know I have most of my family and friends are
(45:27) Protestants are they going to hell?" And he was like "Well you were a Protestant before you became Orthodox right?" And he said "Yeah were you going to hell?"
(45:35) And he was like "You know I don't know." And he's like "Well the thing is is is
(45:40) um you know don't be too quick to make salvific claims because didn't you know
(45:45) God before you were an Orthodox?" And he said "Yeah I knew God before I was an Orthodox." And he's like "Yeah so did
(45:51) I." So you know his his basic point here was like "Don't be in too much of a rush
(45:56) to make these salvific claims about other people." And I agree and the Orthodox Church their official doctrine
(46:02) is like we don't make salvific claims but what we can claim is the fullness of the truth right and if you don't have
(46:09) the fullness of the truth is your salvation in jeopardy i think that's a better case to make
(46:16) hm what is necessary to be saved in Orthodox church because I think it's interesting that you know we looked up
(46:22) some of this like the the Orthodox church is growing um and I tried to find some of the differences and I you and I
(46:27) have had better conversations on some of the differences that are in the church than you can really find out there so I bet a lot of our audience may not even
(46:33) know well salvation is not from again check with orthodox authority on this
(46:39) which I'm not and I'm not a minister and I'm not a priest okay Dave Smith not clergy right well there's no for for
(46:48) real Orthodox apologists they should have a blessing from their priest from their parish this kind of thing i'm I'm
(46:55) fine talking about this stuff and it's it's not even really a disclaimer it's just like look um you know I've been in
(47:02) Orthodox for a few years and there's people way more knowledgeable than me so double check everything I say here i'm
(47:07) just giving you my I actually think that's the best way to lead it my the guy that's my favorite kind of expositor he he basically says like "Listen make
(47:13) sure you go back to scripture." again from the Protestant perspective make sure you go back to scripture to see if what I'm saying is true yeah you know
(47:18) don't just take my word for it do your and I'm not an apologist it's not my my my training and Jay Dyer would be the
(47:24) guy for all that stuff but I can give you the view the view is that from the Orthodox perspective
(47:30) salvation is a lifetime process called theosis it's not an action or a mind
(47:36) state and this this is one of my biggest problems with Protestantism in general is the idea of the mind state of
(47:41) salvation i've accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior done right that's not
(47:48) that's not even if you think about it for four seconds that's really bad so in orthodoxy
(47:54) uh we have things called sins of omission which means if you can do a
(47:59) thing in which to um somehow glorify God from the biblical sense you ought do
(48:06) that thing if you don't do that thing you're in you're you're sinning right you're committing a sin of omission now
(48:12) these are pardonable sins don't get me wrong but it you know this is something like if a person let's say they're stuck
(48:19) on the side of the road you know what I mean something like this and you could help them but you just didn't want to cuz you're inconvenience yeah that'd be
(48:26) an easy way thing to point to and say it's a sin of omission right these are spots where you could have shown the
(48:31) grace of God and you didn't right now I'm guilty of those more than anything probably right there's times where I've
(48:38) been in like brutal you know blood sport debates and the person's down and I know
(48:44) I don't have to kick them again i can show a little grace you do you know but I'm going to heal kick them right and I
(48:50) know I know I'm guilty of that right i'm just you know I'm chief of chief of sinners right chief of sinners but the
(48:57) idea that salvation is a lifetime process through theosis becoming more like Christ is the orthodox view can you
(49:04) process can you lose your salvation yeah well of course and by the way that this
(49:09) once saved always saved it's stupid it doesn't even make sense like you would have to make the determination
(49:16) that you can read another person's heart oh no no no yeah I 100% agree like it'd be very difficult and and we're actually
(49:22) caution even in Protestant churches against saying like you're saved or not saved that's not something like that's
(49:28) for the Holy Spirit not me but even once saved always saved just that that's illogical on its face why couldn't Why
(49:34) couldn't you renounce your you know why couldn't you be saved and really mean it you really mean it 100% and then you
(49:42) know like a catastrophe happens your daughter at 3 years old dies horrifically of cancer and you lose your
(49:49) faith right so do you lose it or do you renounce it like is it because you're so
(49:54) mad at I think there's a difference here because I'll give you my caveat that that I agree with you in a large way
(49:59) well you lose it okay i say it's gone right i I would say this if if you reject Christ you don't you're not saved
(50:06) right so I would say that it will never surprise you right because scripture is pretty clear about people who have come
(50:11) to the knowledge of God and tasted that fruit once they have fallen away cannot be brought back that's something we have
(50:17) to deal with in scripture which to your point once saved always saved kind of falls at that verse and you're like well
(50:23) that doesn't really exist but I don't think you can accidentally through the process of sanctification and so as a
(50:28) Christian as a Protestant I don't believe in you make a decision and that's the end of the story i do believe
(50:34) that when it when you know the Bible tells us that if you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord you will be saved that it
(50:41) means just that but it doesn't stop there that was James' point to Paul was saying like yes you are saved but this
(50:47) is what life should look like after this because of the fact that you're saved like this should be how you live as a Christian doesn't mean you're earning it
(50:53) every single day it means that you're responding to the grace of God yeah but you would lose you could still lose that
(50:59) how can you lose that though because you can renounce it no from that I agree if you do renounce it that would be my
(51:04) caveat like yes you can renounce your faith i do believe that you can lose salvation yes but I mean you I say it
(51:10) wouldn't surprise you like I wouldn't go through my life thinking like and God would I would get to heaven and God would be like "Yes but this sin right
(51:16) here." And be like "Wait what?" Like I don't think it would surprise anybody like I didn't accidentally lose my faith
(51:22) because I forgot to keep some ordinance or something like that it would be a renunciation that it would take for me to do that and I also would agree that
(51:29) behavior over time especially looking at sin and calling it good over time could be a renunciation not just like a
(51:35) proclamation right well no no well that doesn't actually follow so I'm thinking about what you're saying let me steal
(51:41) man and make sure I got it right um you're saying like look you have
(51:46) salvation let's say you have salvation you've confessed with your mouth Christ is Lord all right and you believe it
(51:53) with your heart but due to like you not following certain things you know you die purposefully i mean like by accident
(52:00) yeah by accident even right and you die and you go to heaven right or wherever judgment day right you're being judged
(52:06) you don't think God's going to be like "Look you didn't go to church these three Sundays straight to hell with you." Right okay or I committed a sin
(52:14) that I was not able to atone for prior to my death yeah I get that but what about omission what like what about
(52:20) omission like what if it is the case that you're put time and time again in front of proper theology and in front of
(52:27) proper action proper way and you reject that anyway how's it is that is that accidental at that point i I I I think
(52:34) I'm following where you're going give me an example of that well is the truth written on your heart it should be yes yeah it should be so
(52:40) then h how do these sins of omission happen to begin with like you know what's right you know what's wrong right
(52:47) it's written on your heart mhm so if you're if you're accidentally not doing what's right is it an accident but
(52:53) aren't you going to be doing that Andrew from now until the day you die what sins of omission sins of Yeah sure i'll be
(52:58) doing sins but the thing is is like that doesn't mean I don't consciously understand but that's what confession is
(53:05) right i'm confessing my sins of omission confessing my sins but do you remember
(53:10) one of them well I shouldn't I shouldn't assume something i In Catholicism there is a state of grace right i've been
(53:16) forgiven of my sins i want to die in a state of grace forgive me for not knowing this because I I haven't studied this in a long time but that if I don't
(53:22) die in a state of grace according to Catholicism and then I want to know what orthodoxy says does that mean I am no
(53:28) longer saved or does that is there some media I guess
(53:33) intermediary here like my like I've been forgiven of my sins i've confessed my final confession
(53:40) right last rights I guess sure being performed is that necessary to maintain
(53:45) or be saved or to go to heaven when I die no and nobody nobody can introduce necessity that way like if you couldn't
(53:52) get your last rights cuz you're in a war zone right yeah exactly i thought about the same thing i don't think I don't think what if I'm going off a cliff i'm
(53:58) sorry that's not condemnation immediately but I guess what I'm getting at is like and I think you can logically
(54:04) argue this both ways so that's fair i think you can logically argue you know a sin of omission maybe you actually didn't know right mh um but I think that
(54:11) that would defeat the purpose of a sin of omission i think how could it be a sin if you didn't know right the sin of omission is like you do know you did
(54:18) know but you chose not to but you chose not to right okay so that's a little more clear definition of it and I think that's fair i I do think that
(54:24) Protestants have a big problem with this and and comment below guys let me know what you think um there does seem to be
(54:30) a like I feel good therefore I'm going to walk down the aisle and say that I accept Christ and it's like well hold on
(54:36) didn't say that I had an emotional response to a sermon which can happen right or a worship you know conference
(54:42) whatever it may be or a moment at a uh what was the restaurant that you said the waffle house the waffle house or at
(54:47) the I was in the lobby of a Spirit Airlines and I saw my eyes flash before my eyes you know like I I get that that
(54:54) can that can happen to people but that's not what we're talking about we're talking like actual deep rooted belief
(54:59) and in a lot of Protestant churches the thing that bothered me so I was on a ministry team at one of my churches and
(55:04) I would be the guy that stands down there at the end of the church for people to come down and pray to accept Christ if we did an altar call I would
(55:10) go and what I found in this particular church and I ended up leaving the church shortly after this was that if we had 10
(55:17) people eight were rededicating their lives two people were being saved um making that confession for the first
(55:23) time and I saw a huge problem with that because I'm like wait rededicating your life i understand the idea of
(55:29) rededicating and maybe saying "Hey I've been straying and wandering away from this but that rule pretty much held 60
(55:34) 70 80% of every single one of those times." And I'm like "We're doing this wrong." Like we're telling people that
(55:40) walking down the aisle is going to fix everything and you just have to make a one-time verbal declaration and not
(55:46) following up this is how you should live you're saying it's a mind state but but wouldn't you say that it's a sin of
(55:52) omission if you declared with your mouth and truly believed that Christ was your Lord and Savior but then locked yourself
(55:59) in your home and shut yourself away from society and did no works at all even though you could have for sure yeah i
(56:06) think that's James' point like faith has to have works that goes with it not to earn it so that's the position that's
(56:11) the position of the Orthodox though right it's faith and works it can't be faith alone it can't be solid i think I
(56:18) think that's very clear in scripture but I think people but it can't be solos scriptor either oh come on and let me
(56:24) explain hang on let me give you the logical argument here we're going to we're going to trash Martin again yeah but I I got to I got to I got to try
(56:30) this i'm going to try cuz I think I can bring you to my side on this don't you dare if you can't read which most people
(56:36) couldn't throughout human history right how do you learn the scripture you don't have to the the heavens declare the
(56:42) glory of God so that no man can stand before God and have an excuse right so creation testifies to God so Native
(56:48) Americans were Christians no I'm not saying they're Christians i'm saying that they would have been held accountable to know that there is a God
(56:55) just by the declaration of of the creation they would have been held to account for the action of good and evil
(57:01) from a Christian ethic Christians because the truth's written on your heart right to know that there is a God i want to be specific on
(57:07) that to know that there is a God like that there is a God now what happened prior to Christ aztecs cutting people's hearts out on a temple they're going to
(57:13) hell right rough i would imagine they're going to hell they would be they would have to they would have to declare like
(57:18) hey I I can look around and see that this is not just happen stance then you're holding them to the Christian ethical standard why is that because how
(57:24) else would you make the determination that that was wrong i wouldn't say it's the Christian ethical standard because what other
(57:30) ethical standard in the Old Testament that would be the Jewish ethical standard that which would inform Christian ethics before Christian ethics
(57:37) yes so but I would say no inform this one case I would blame the Jews yeah
(57:42) yeah well like I mean let's see if we can square this real quick yeah no I think it's an interesting argument how is it
(57:48) how do you hold them to the standard that they're going to hell unless you're judging them by Christian ethics i don't god does yeah but not for me to say god
(57:56) tells me that's how the world works you don't think they're going to hell i'm saying it doesn't matter what my opinion is i'm saying it's not a copout when I
(58:04) say it's God's opinion just on homosexuality do you think homosexuality is good or bad it doesn't matter what does God say about homosexuality that's
(58:10) how you inform your opinion yeah right that's what I'm saying this is what God says therefore that's what I believe so
(58:16) then God must have some formed in their hearts have no idea that doing that was evil i have no idea
(58:24) like I'm I'm not trying just like you're trying to not make a salvation a salvific or salvation claim against I'm
(58:29) going to make salvation claims about about Aztecs who cut out human hearts and kick them down they're going to hell
(58:34) i imagine so i'm just saying I'm not making they're going to hell but if they had a Charlie Manson moment right after
(58:40) cutting out the beating heart this is wrong i'm sorry you know like okay maybe in order for me to determine that I'm
(58:46) going to have to assume I'm going to have to make some suppositions here some logical suppositions the first one I'm going to have to make is that the truth
(58:53) is written on people's hearts and that they knew that that was wrong and I'm judging them from the Christian standard
(58:59) because there is no other standard of ethics for which to judge another human being as a Christian except through
(59:04) those standards right agreed then if that's the case or Jewish standard sorry yeah then if then if then if that's the
(59:09) case right how is it that now there's no
(59:15) solos scriptorra now there's no Bible now there's no interpreter there's no
(59:20) nothing right so how do you make that judgment exactly how do you make that declaration because that's what God has
(59:25) told us now that we do have the Bible yeah but how do you know that that's what he said because you have the Bible
(59:30) now I see where you're going you jerk
(59:36) you're right the Catholics got together and gave us the Bible just to piss you off yeah that's right
(59:43) all right it is interesting i feel like we can move on but I want you to stew on that for the rest of your life well and
(59:48) you're going to give me on my deathbed andrew was right
(59:56) no I think it's interesting because there there are a lot of people who we we spend a lot of time on the wrong
(1:00:01) things in our lives and we don't really evaluate and we we do this in politics we we talked about this with feminism
(1:00:07) when we did the Ash Wednesday we talked about with with a number of different things we build on a foundation and a
(1:00:13) lot of times we end up in a very kind of different place than that foundation would have initially told us we were going right we have foundational core
(1:00:20) beliefs that don't align with where we are and you made a really I thought it was a really good point on cognitive
(1:00:25) dissonance where you're like I'm not going to let you up like I have to destroy your foundation not because I hate you because I hate you i need your
(1:00:32) foundation to crumble so that you can come to a place of actually looking and evaluating this seriously looking at
(1:00:37) this and evaluating it seriously to see if that is actually true and that's a
(1:00:42) painful process and and it's well it's painful on my behalf too because um you know for me I don't it's very
(1:00:50) difficult especially modernity to determine where the threshold is for grace you know what I mean like did I go
(1:00:56) too far or did I not go far enough right yeah um that's it's actually a difficult line to
(1:01:04) determine you know what I mean and so like sometimes I've done whatever episodes where I know like by by the
(1:01:11) time I was done I just couldn't brea I'm like this it's so horrible what these people are saying and what they've done
(1:01:17) you know what I mean this type of thing i have to like stand there for a second and catch my breath and be like man you
(1:01:22) know maybe actually I should have been way more brutal because maybe that would
(1:01:28) have like pierced that a little more you know what I mean but then another time maybe I'm really brutal and I'm like "Do
(1:01:34) you ever apologize?" I wonder if like if you thought maybe you were too brutal in a situation yeah well I mean I
(1:01:42) Yeah there there's been times where I've said I'm sorry to to people like uh you're still wrong but I'm sorry that
(1:01:47) Yeah yeah no no no there's there's been times where I'm like "Look you know maybe that was a little out of line or I
(1:01:52) didn't mean it like that you know so I apologize or stuff like Yeah I've done that yeah yeah it doesn't seem like
(1:01:58) you're in any way trying to you know win the argument for the sake of winning the
(1:02:03) argument it's actually to either change lives or or to put the information out there so other people see what truth is
(1:02:09) yeah is that accurate so I will try the only time I attempt on purpose to win an
(1:02:15) argument for the sake of it would be for like debate prep or to play devil's advocate to get another person to
(1:02:20) understand the view yeah or something like this but if when I'm actually debating with people and their
(1:02:25) ideologies I am not um trying to be vicious or or things like this on
(1:02:30) purpose but rather I'm trying to break the worldview down sometimes getting a person to listen is difficult right it's
(1:02:37) difficult and so you have to navigate and every person's different after thousands upon thousands of conversations with people all over the
(1:02:43) world and thousands of debates it becomes easier to judge a person how to navigate those waters like this person
(1:02:50) actually is going to respond better if I'm a little meaner or this person's going to respond a little better if I
(1:02:55) like maybe frog boil them like a frog you know what I mean let the temperature slowly rise you you get that after a
(1:03:01) while but especially early on i'm sure I made tons of mistakes you know what I mean because it just didn't happen no I
(1:03:07) understand like I I don't think it comes from a place of malice is my point it's never been it's well for me it's never been malicious and I always tell the
(1:03:13) women even when I'm done with the podcast and this is most debates I've ever buy a horse no I'm just kidding sometimes but I I'll often say like you
(1:03:20) said whatever podcast i'm sorry that seems to be I say look this there's nothing personal here this is not
(1:03:25) personal for me you're not going to experience any community harassment from my community we're not going to be bothering you you know I'm not going to
(1:03:32) be going on like these big trails to just try to destroy your life or things like that and I never have i've never
(1:03:38) done that stuff you know what I mean i don't take it personally my job is there to represent my view the best possible
(1:03:43) way I can and the representation of those who think like me that's my job and I'm going to do it the best way I
(1:03:49) possibly can so it's not personal but that those views are poisonous they are
(1:03:54) poisonous and they do need to be destroyed yeah so I think that's fair and I you know the point that I was making that led into this is that far
(1:04:00) too often we are unwilling even in this realm like I know I know that I I've
(1:04:06) spent a lot of time studying what I believe and I would probably want to naturally defend it whether it's right
(1:04:12) or wrong i may not want to think about that at first and it may go wait a minute because when you said ste like
(1:04:17) typically my my thing is that I'll defend something because I have a belief in it i try to know why I believe what I
(1:04:22) believe if I have a belief that I don't really like I'll I'll you'll pretty much see it on my face i'm not 100% sure i'm
(1:04:27) saying like I kind of think this but I haven't really thought about that and I'm easy to kind of talk through it some
(1:04:34) stuff that I feel like I really do have good reason for believing it'll take me a couple of days of really thinking about it and I'll evaluate that because
(1:04:40) I don't want to just go well I was right and he was wrong right I don't think that's very even though in my case that is what is in fact true 100% not true
(1:04:47) but nonetheless but I would I would encourage people to do that because it's it's not a bad thing it's a difficult thing to get
(1:04:53) comfortable doing but it's very helpful to do that well get yourself out of a lot of traps too logic is really
(1:04:59) merciless especially when you start going through the confines of thinking thinking and introspecting only using
(1:05:06) logic you realize 90% of you is fake  you realize that maybe how do
(1:05:11) people do that so you said this the other day and I wanted to ask you what if somebody wants to try to get better
(1:05:17) at thinking like that or debating like that or well classic logic operates off of three laws right the the law of um
(1:05:25) non-contradiction the law of excluded middle and the law of identity okay those aren't in exact order by the way
(1:05:32) but those are the three laws of logic and what they're they're making a a
(1:05:37) determination that if if anything's outside the bounds of this right if you
(1:05:43) if you're making a conflation that like Andrew can be you we've now violated the law of identity you know what I mean or
(1:05:50) if a it's a and also not a it's a contradiction right the excluded middle
(1:05:56) where you're saying something's either true or false it can't be both true and false right or you know it has to be one
(1:06:01) or the other if you start actually kind of training your brain to think in those terms right
(1:06:08) that all propositions are true or false you start recognizing most of them are false including the ones you come up
(1:06:14) with yeah how does that feel how does that It's not It's not fun in It's terrible it's terrible right and it's
(1:06:20) the same thing when you start thinking about positions you have which are contradictory mhm when you especially
(1:06:25) when you ask people questions like what would you do in this situation like here I'll give you a good one uh this one
(1:06:31) this one will annoy you till the day you die gum it one of those here we go i already have a death bed andrew was right what else in vitro yeah in vitro
(1:06:37) fertilization yes is it moral or immoral this is in this case we're talking about
(1:06:44) uh artificially putting semen into eggs right okay and then freezing the eggs are those eggs human lives yes okay so
(1:06:53) we're in only say do it one at a time yeah so we're in a fertility we're in a fertility clinic
(1:06:58) okay and there's tens of thousands of eggs and there's a big fire right and there's a 2-year-old on the ground
(1:07:04) screaming you can get to 10,000 of these eggs or you can get to the 2-year-old who's screaming 2-year-old why i have no
(1:07:12) clue but the 2-year-old seems like the answer i mean other than obviously
(1:07:17) there's a a living breathing speaking to me this is a great Listen I don't there's no wrong answer here yeah okay
(1:07:24) but there's answers which sound that sounds wrong because it sounds like what you're saying is you believe all of
(1:07:30) these lives over here are expendable to this life which the abortionist would use to say that you must value this life
(1:07:37) more than those but that's actually false you're not actually saying that saying that you have some kind of like
(1:07:43) intuition towards this but that doesn't actually mean that you're doing anything wrong because you're following your
(1:07:49) intuition here there's actually no right choice yeah what's the right choice well in a Christian athlete you're not making
(1:07:54) a wrong choice by going for the 2-year-old and if it was my 2-year-old I'd be really happy you know I'd be
(1:08:00) really happy but if you were someone who had eggs there you'd be very sad yeah you'd be very sad about that but would
(1:08:05) they blame you no I don't think that they would so but the thing is is like it's when you start thinking inside of
(1:08:12) those paradigms of like do I actually judge these eggs as being the same life
(1:08:17) as that 2-year-old and you're like why and then you have to explore that right you have to kind of dive in to your reasons behind that becomes very
(1:08:24) uncomfortable for you to note that you've you've never really kind of dove into the very beliefs that you have and
(1:08:31) why you have them you know and uh and that can be a very uncomfortable feeling
(1:08:37) very necessary though look we were supposed to maybe we'll have to do a part two of this because we were
(1:08:42) supposed to jump into some stuff about you know the founding fathers and and how Protestants founded the United
(1:08:47) States days i'm waiting here we go we can do one more i'm happy you're welcome
