(8:40) eyes he's the emperor yeah with no
(8:46) disguise let down by his own price is an intellection sexual line oper's got mind
(8:56) control powers divine he's calling St michael the devil in charge and telling
(9:03) the Catholics they got it too large oh James don't you know it's a tricky game
(9:10) when you're calling out folks but you're doing the same you say it's the truth

(12:36) what up guys happy Friday yo it's been quite a week it has
(12:42) been an insane week i was late starting the stream today because women don't know how to drive
(12:49) can we just talk about this for a second all I needed to do was run to the beer
(12:54) store to get beer for the stream because spy stream ended early because the leftist didn't really show up with a
(13:02) presentation so spy stream ended early i had time to go to the beer store i had like 45 minutes all I had to do was
(13:09) drive two miles down the road do I get back in time for five o'clock no do you
(13:15) want to know why women drivers women suck as drivers they suck and like I'm a
(13:22) really good driver i'm going to be like "Oh but not me." But no no seriously i'm a really good driver i've never been in an accident that was my fault i've never
(13:29) gotten a speeding ticket and I speed like a fucking madman i am more aggressive of a driver than most men I
(13:35) know in fact sometimes when I have a like if I'm driving the car when a man's in the car like they will admit that I'm
(13:40) a more aggressive but also better driver than they are cuz I just I learned I I
(13:46) dated a boy in college that taught me how to drive a car okay i was properly
(13:52) trained most women are not that lucky most women have to learn how to drive
(13:57) from their mothers and their mothers also suck as drivers and so thus they
(14:03) teach the daughters to suck as drivers and it is a it is a cycle it is a perpetual cycle and obviously the only
(14:10) the only solution to this is to ban women from driving cars entirely and I know that some might say that might
(14:16) affect me but I don't actually really leave my house that much and so I would
(14:23) I would sacrifice my ability to drive a car legally i'd probably still drive it
(14:28) illegally but like I would I would I would sacrifice my ability to legally drive a car to get all other women off
(14:34) the road just because I just think everyone would be much happier and the world would be better and we would all
(14:41) get where we're going faster and uh and oh Victor just my husband just texted me
(14:48) from the downstairs and he said "No wonder miles per gallon drop after you
(14:53) drive the car
(14:59) okay maybe I am not the best driver in the world in terms of gas mileage but I am the best driver in the world in terms
(15:06) of getting where I need to go fast without causing an accident and
(15:12) also knowing how to merge can we talk about people who don't know how to fucking merge they ruin everything for
(15:20) everyone and there are men out there who don't know how to merge their cars either and it ruins everything like all people have to do is cooperate it's
(15:26) really not that hard be in the lane you're supposed to be in if you're driving slow to like don't be in the fast lane i don't know why I have to
(15:32) explain this anyway so that's why I was
(15:37) late but we're here and it's Friday and
(15:42) wouldn't you know it you know we reached a new low this
(15:48) week in that the dissident right is now defined
(15:54) by a sandwich the dissident right is now
(15:59) defined by the defense of a sandwich
(16:07) james Lindsay has turned the entire internet stupid and the entire internet
(16:13) was already pretty effing stupid to begin with yep based husband yep based
(16:19) husband gets better gas mileage on the car than I do james Lindsay has turned the entire
(16:25) internet stupid and the internet was already stupid to begin with yeah slow clap for Ariel Scarcella for correctly
(16:32) defining queer as Marxist you know she she follows the queer Marxism account so I wasn't surprised she got it right
(16:38) thanks for the super chat so listen I'm not going to go through the entire James
(16:44) saga last night James was fighting with Chris Rufo because Chris Rufo literally just posted a picture of a sandwich and
(16:51) so James decided that like literally all roof actually you know what fuck it fuck it i will show you guys this i will show
(16:58) you guys this because it was so stupid it was so retarded
(17:04) like I didn't think that we could reach a a a greater level of retardia with James than we reached but oh we did last
(17:13) night so actually that's not the best one here it is
(17:20) so Christopher Rufo posted just a picture of a
(17:26) sandwich and that broke James and James says "You realize you're marking
(17:32) yourself right?" So now James is trying to warn Chris Rufo that he's on the woke right
(17:38) for posting a picture of a sandwich and then James retweeted some random account
(17:43) that says "James Lindsay has a history of getting publicly trounced by former friends who choose to bandwagon on
(17:51) cancellation pylons he does not however have a history of being wrong about the stuff he is sounding the alarm over."
(17:57) Well no james does actually have a history of being wrong which I have
(18:03) thoroughly documented on this channel but I don't think that
(18:09) Christopher Rufo posting a picture of a sandwich can accurately be described as
(18:15) engaging in dog piling and cancellation it's a
(18:22) sandwich everyone needs to calm down and then someone else
(18:28) responded and James says "Oh this is where James admitted he has he has bipolar disorder i know we're all
(18:36) shocked at the revelation that James Lindsay has bipolar
(18:42) disorder because someone responded to James or or maybe even I don't know they responded to someone and this person
(18:48) said "I'm worried he James is pushing himself so hard he's going to have a
(18:54) manic break." And James says "That's the depressive portion of the cycle in the manic portion I wrote a book in a
(19:02) week." Yeah did Hitler eat sandwiches James did Hitler eat sandwiches is the
(19:10) question we should all be asking ourselves right now and then Carrie Carrie Karen Smith actually
(19:18) that's not even the funniest one carrie Karen Smith who is a psychotic
(19:23) person that's obsessed with me you can read about Car's obsession at surviving carryith.substack.com but I just thought
(19:30) this was funny because Carrie posted this longass essay of a post that I
(19:35) didn't read in which she was defending James Lindsay's honor and then in the
(19:40) post of her defending James Lindsay's honor does Carrie post a picture of herself with James because Carrie has
(19:48) pictures of herself with James she's posted them before so what did she post
(19:53) on the picture that with the long post defending James' honor she posted a picture of
(20:00) herself just so we know that she's not trying to make this all about her she posted a picture by
(20:07) herself on a massive post defending James and then she posted this
(20:13) completely unfunny woke right bingo card and I swear to God I saw this i was like
(20:20) Carrie you are such a fucking cringe white liberal i cannot even this is her
(20:26) attempt to own the gripers and the and the so-called woke right and it's a pink
(20:33) bingo card with words that aren't even relevant and ideas that aren't even it's
(20:38) like no one under there is there is no universe in which anyone finds this
(20:44) bingo card funny except white liberal women of a certain
(20:50) age so I don't know man the world has gone mad and everything sucks and
(20:55) everyone's stupid and um yeah I just I don't Oh you sent me
(21:03) you sent me a bingo card in the DMs okay well I'll look at that in a second so everything sucks and everyone's stupid
(21:09) and so I thought I would drink some beer and watch uh Andrew Wilson does everyone
(21:14) want to drink some beer and uh watch Andrew Wilson because the reason I'm interested in Andrew Wilson okay here's the thing here's the thing i have two
(21:20) Andrew Wilson things I want to watch how many people are in the chat right now just for Andrew
(21:27) Wilson just let me know like okay so I'm going to be
(21:32) honest i am not necessarily the biggest fan of Andrew
(21:38) Wilson but my opinion of Andrew Wilson was formed a long time ago and to be fair
(21:46) mostly my negative opinion of Andrew Wilson comes as a result of me not liking Andrew Wilson's
(21:53) wife because she's a bit much and I don't like
(21:58) her but like Andrew Wilson himself like I've seen him do some underhanded things
(22:03) that I don't like i've seen him do very underhanded things okay so I know that he is capable
(22:09) of doing underhanded things and I think I formed my original opinion of him based on him doing underhanded things
(22:15) but I'm kind of at a place in my life right now where I'm giving a lot of
(22:22) people a lot of second chances
(22:27) i'm opening up to the fact that maybe I
(22:33) can be a bit of a harsh judge of people at times and maybe I should sometimes chill
(22:41) out and be I'm trying so hard to not be
(22:47) an Aries okay just for a change of pace and so I unblocked a whole bunch of
(22:54) people on Twitter and I unblocked a whole bunch of people on the YouTube channel and I'm I'm trying to just start with a clean slate and I've been kind of
(23:01) trying to do this uh you know for a little while listen I mean I I'm still going to say there are times when you
(23:08) all deserve it okay don't don't get it twisted i'm not going to be nice all the time i I'm an Aries at the end of the
(23:14) day and don't expect don't expect that I'm gonna be kissing your guys' asses or
(23:19) anything i'm just saying that I am trying very hard to be
(23:29) nicer because I'm tired of fighting with people on the internet i'm tired of it what I do tracking the left is too hard
(23:36) and it it sucks the life out of me and listen I don't need to be fighting with everyone all the time most of the time I
(23:43) just don't care that's where I'm at see see you know and then some people just want me
(23:49) to be more of a dominatrix on the internet see I'm going to lose my entire audience of men who just wanted me to be
(23:55) the dominatrix you know we'll see how this goes no no Taurus no no taurus and I do
(24:03) not get along uh-uh no no no offense if you're a Taurus but the sign after a
(24:10) sign is a rebuttal to a sign taurus comes after Aries that means we don't necessarily get along taurus move way
(24:16) too slow it's maddening how slow Taurus move okay yeah see Rottweiler and I get
(24:24) along because he is a Leo and Aries gets along with Leo i also do get along with Sagittarius quite well aries supremacy
(24:32) exactly aries are the number one sign of the zodiac we are the top sign we are
(24:37) number one everyone else comes after us exactly aries are the best number
(24:45) one yep got some Aries got some Sagge yeah it is an Aries thing it's
(24:52) true oh Scorpio oh no oh no oh no i just learned a lot about you
(25:00) Wescott anyway so I'm trying very hard to give people second chances and so we
(25:07) watched Andrew Wilson just mop the absolute floor with the mis with the
(25:13) midwipit moron the misfit patriot earlier this week and I have to say I
(25:18) was actually uh Nick is a Leo of course Nick is a Leo i was actually kind of impressed
(25:25) with Andrew Wilson's performance i've always known that Andrew Wilson is smart i think he uses debate tactics more than
(25:34) he like understands the topics i think that's kind of like he he understands the ins and outs of debate tactics which
(25:39) I think can be a little underhanded if I'm honest about it this is part of the reason I don't debate because it becomes
(25:44) so much more about debate tactics than it does about an exchange of ideas or actually getting at the truth or any of
(25:50) those things but I think that Andrew Wilson is very good at debate tactics and I loved loved loved loved loved
(25:58) watching him just mop the floor with the midwit moron and so I kind of sat back
(26:03) for a couple days this week and I was like I you know maybe I need to give Andrew Wilson a second chance and so I
(26:11) just thought we'd have a chill stream where I watch some Andrew Wilson videos now I have something this is brand new
(26:16) and then I have something that's a little bit older and I'm going to explain why we're watching the Adam Green thing too because people might not like that but I'm I'm I'm trying to do
(26:22) two things at once so I'm going to explain the first thing we're going to watch after we get a beer of course
(26:28) because it is happy hour yeah i gave you a second chance
(26:35) Bronuck exactly now you're a channel member and everything so we're going to
(26:40) watch this this is a clip that just went up on Piers Morgan's channel like a couple hours ago and apparently it's
(26:45) Andrew and his wife yelling at some feminist and I thought that that would be pretty funny so I kind of want to
(26:50) watch this i don't like Piers Morgan but I was like this is just brand new and it looks like it could be entertaining so we'll watch that that's number one and
(26:57) then and then we're going to go back we're going to go back several months this was uh streamed almost a
(27:04) year ago now why don't I like Rachel Wilson
(27:10) because I find her to be annoy because like most women I find her to be
(27:16) annoying and I kind of think that like she wants to be a trad wife then why is
(27:22) she all over the internet sort of thing it's like I guess she can do whatever she wants i don't personally care but I
(27:27) just find it to be just like a touch disingenuous so I don't know maybe I would think
(27:34) differently of her today so anyway after we watch that Piers Morgan thing I want
(27:40) to go back into the archive a little bit and I want to watch Andrew Wilson debate Adam Green the reason I want to watch
(27:45) Andrew Wilson debate Adam Green is that a I want to watch Andrew Wilson and
(27:50) decide if I like him or not but B so I've been watching Adam Green's content a little
(27:57) bit more over the past couple months just kind of like you know at night and stuff when I need when I like need
(28:03) something on in the background and so I'd been going over some like my thoughts about what what I think about
(28:10) Adam Green's content i've had Adam Green on the channel i bet on his show whatever we can't talk anymore because
(28:15) of of interpersonal bullshit and reasons like whatever which sucks but it is what it is and and so I have actually had
(28:23) questions um specifically on a couple of the the points that Adam makes most
(28:29) specifically the question I have is I'm not convinced that Jesus was not a historical person and I actually am
(28:36) trying here with Adam Green listen I'm trying with Adam Green because I actually do agree with a lot
(28:43) of his ideas i just am not 100% there yet with some of these ideas and then so
(28:49) I've been I was trying to get him to like talk to me and answer some questions that I had and he never got
(28:56) back to me and so last night I did a Twitter space where I went into kind of
(29:02) the people that are talking about Adam Green's ideas and I was just going to listen to them but then they started
(29:08) like basically they they wanted to talk to people about whether or not Jesus was like a real person or whatever and I was
(29:14) like well I actually have questions about this and so I joined the space and the thing of it was is these people who
(29:21) I'm sure are perfectly nice people whatever are push are talking about Adam's Adam Green's ideas they did not
(29:28) do a very good job of convincing me and even Adam joined the space at one point
(29:33) and he didn't do a great job of convincing me because here's the here's the challenge that happened on the
(29:39) Twitter space last night it was that like I went on the on the space and I
(29:44) said "I want you guys to convince me that Jesus was not a historical like a
(29:50) real person." And they kept trying to convince me
(29:56) based on the talking points they use when they're talking to Christians or or the
(30:03) talking points that they use when they're trying to get people to like give up the belief in the Bible or to
(30:10) realize that maybe a lot of the stuff in the Bible is like Jewish myth and all
(30:15) this stuff they were they were using the same talking points on me as they do with everyone else and I was kind of like I'm not a Christian so you don't
(30:22) need to convince me that the Bible isn't real my argument doesn't come from the
(30:27) Bible it comes from something else and so they couldn't really handle that
(30:32) argument now the Pisces tried the Pisces on the Twitter space he tried he tried
(30:38) so hard but I think even the Pisces in that case like his argument to me may
(30:44) have been more effective had he not been performing for an audience and he could
(30:49) just have a real conversation cuz of course you're also in a space where you can't necessarily have real conversations
(30:56) anyway suffice it to say I was not satisfied with the answer that I got on the Twitter space i haven't been totally
(31:04) satisfied with the answers that I've gotten to some of Adam Green's ideas and so I want to just watch more content
(31:10) with him and what I thought was Andrew Wilson is a good debater andrew Wilson
(31:16) is going to be able to put pressure on Adam Green to kind of extrapolate out some of his ideas and so I want to watch
(31:24) this even though it's older because I want to decide if I like Andrew Wilson or not and I want to watch Adam Green
(31:30) actually get like a hard cross-examination about his ideas which is what I think Andrew Wilson will do
(31:35) and if I'm completely wrong about that's that being the content of this I'm sure someone in the chat has seen it so you guys can tell me but that's why we're
(31:42) watching this all right that's why we're watching this and I want to be very very clear i'm not going to defend Adam
(31:48) Green's ideas even though I do agree with most of them i don't know his ideas well enough to defend them
(31:54) so I don't want anyone to make me the great defender of anyone i'm not the great defender of anyone i'm not on
(32:00) anyone's side i'm not on anyone's team i just don't want to fight with people anymore and that's where I'm at so
(32:07) that's what we're going to do today guys if you feel like hanging out this is happy hour and what that means is I have
(32:13) beer and so before we're going to get started I'm going to uh show you guys the beer I just bought from the craft
(32:19) beer store and I'm going to put a poll in the chat and you guys get to tell me which beer I drink first i will probably
(32:24) not be drinking all four beers on the stream today but I guess let's see how long this goes if you have something fun
(32:29) it's a Friday let us know what you're drinking in the chat hang on let me grab my beer i'll be right back hang
(32:37) on all right here's the beer we have four beers if you don't like craft beer
(32:43) it's because you haven't found the one you like yet um it's a very hot day in New Hampshire and so I'm getting I got
(32:49) some fruity beers i got some fruity kind of like sour summery beers now when I went to the craft beer store today I had
(32:55) one mission i was like I want a blueberry beer i don't really care which blueberry beer that is but I wanted a
(33:01) blueberry beer and lo and behold as soon as I walked in the craft beer store guy walked up and he was holding a threeack
(33:07) of blueberry beer and he said "Oh do you want one of these?" And I said "Yes I do yes I do." So it was a sign from the
(33:12) universe the first beer on our list today is Great North Ale Works where is that is that out of Maine manchester New
(33:21) Hampshire blueberry Sour Ale it's raining blueberries that is option number one today
(33:29) option number two is I love orange creamsicles and so if you put an orange creamsicle beer in
(33:35) front of me then I might buy it so this is
(33:41) from Oh look it says I'm supposed to gently roll the can before I pour the
(33:46) beer for optimal experience this is from Heavy Real Brewing where are you from heavy Real Brewing what state are you in
(33:53) do you have an address on this can i don't see it let's see nope no address
(33:59) so I have no idea where this is from but it's an orange creamsicle so probably doesn't even matter our next
(34:07) one you're having some homebrew strawberry wine that sounds really
(34:13) good did I see Liberty Lockdown talking about James Lindsay and I don't I find
(34:19) Clint to be disingenuous at best i don't really want to watch Clint clint blocked
(34:24) me because I asked a question about the Libertarian National Convention i think he's a conservative that pretends to be a libertarian for clout like so I don't
(34:32) really watch him that's fine i don't really care if you guys do though anyway so our next one is from Magnify Brewing
(34:37) which are they in Colorado i feel like they're in Colorado nope new Jersey totally wrong so Magnify Brewing is one
(34:44) of my favorite breweries they do really really really really really good sour and it looks like they've got like a
(34:49) Kool-Aid beer but they had to call it a fruit punch beer but it looks kind of like a Kool-Aid beer called Oh Yeah and
(34:56) so they actually made it with It looks like Kool-Aid or fruit punch so that is
(35:01) option number three and then option number four is revisiting a brewery I haven't had in a
(35:07) while i feel like they're from Colorado or something where are you from florida see I'm completely off in all my in all
(35:14) my breweries today i have not had Tripping Animals Brewery in a while tripping Animals Brewery does these
(35:21) really really really thick kind of like dessert smoothie beers with lots and lots of fruit in it but I I saw this can
(35:27) and I was like Tigerto Boom Boom that's kind of an interesting can i do like a
(35:33) good beer can so Tigerita Boom Boom is a sour ale
(35:39) conditioned with apricot cherry coconut marshmallow and Madagascar vanilla so
(35:46) that is our wildcar beer the tiger beer we're going to call it i'm going to put the poll in the chat oh shit where'd my
(35:52) poll go i had a poll and now the poll is gone
(35:58) where did my poll go that's not fair hang on hang on which beer i'm going to do poll on the fly
(36:06) blueberry what is it
(36:12) orange fruit punch or

(38:23) bins out do you you know keep the trash out i mean what do you do do you do anything i don't do shit the piece of
(38:28) shit that you're married to yeah he clearly doesn't respect you jokes about how he married you he
(38:35) doesn't even piece of shit that's why you Clementine do all lives matter you do you know what all lives do matter and
(38:41) thank you thank you and what's the one terrible thing you found
(38:47) i've never said you completely agree with Clementine do you hate men no of
(38:52) course I don't hate men why in 2020 did you tweet the Corona virus isn't killing men fast enough i tweeted that in 2020
(38:59) as a misguided tweet apologize to men again do it again this is
(39:04) honestly just one of the most absurd conversations I've ever had in my life
(39:10) white House press secretary Caroline Levit is really out of the spotlight that's her job after all for what is
(39:15) worse she seems to be very good at it but a behind-the-scenes photograph posted by a colleague for Mother's Day in the in America has divided opinion
(39:23) even among a generally appreciative MAGA base 16 million people saw this candy snap of
(39:29) leather in the White House seemingly holding a baby son in one arm while quote owning the libs close quotes were
(39:35) the other a lot of those people applauded her as a super mom many others criticized her for aping conservative
(39:40) family values listen I don't give a flying fuck if she has her kid in the White House what I do care about is that
(39:47) she's wasting taxpayer dollars owning the libs as though that means something
(39:52) come this is this is this is the level of seriousness in this White House owning the
(39:58) libs okay while actually promoting a feminist myth about women who can have it all that
(40:05) might seem a bit harsh but the MAGA movement she's part of has made big inroads in popular culture by promoting
(40:11) the return of traditional gender roles here she is talking about masculinity back in 2023
(40:18) a man is someone who stands up for his family provides for those that he loves and contributes to his community a great
(40:25) example helping an elderly woman with her groceries helping a neighbor or a friend putting others before yourself
(40:31) that's the definition of a man i'm proud to have so many strong men in my life two older brothers a great father we
(40:37) love men we need men and as women Jen we should not be afraid to say that well there's undeniably been a huge backlash
(40:44) to the whole era of demoralizing all men as miniature Harvey Weinstein with
(40:49) ambitions that are wickedly patriarchal coincidentally you can read about how that's going on in my upcoming new book
(40:56) Woke Is Dead ever been a better time for a book called He wrote a book called
(41:01) Woke is
(41:07) Dead i'm surrounded by retards i am we are all surrounded by retards and that
(41:13) is why the left will win and we will lose because our team is filled with retards woke is dead but where does the
(41:21) renaissance of masculine men leave the women who thought it was a very good idea andrew Wilson was extoing the
(41:27) virtues of a more limited female role in a previous debate on uncensored when a shocked Emily Austin said this are you
(41:34) married how do you make a married with many children you married with children
(41:39) oh she's she's ecstatic no I'm 23 i'm a boss lady girl which seems to be driving
(41:45) you crazy yeah well I'm just pointing out for the right guy the only thing you have you
(41:50) have no arguments you just try to assault me personally well Andrew Wilson's apparently ecstatic wife Rachel
(41:57) got in touch on X and told me she'd like to participate in our next debate and so
(42:02) she will she'll be joining us alongside an all new panel of boss lady girls
(42:09) well joining me now is the host of Crucible Andrew Wilson Andrew's wife and author of Occult Feminism the secret
(42:15) history of women's liberation Rachel Wilson Emily Wilson No Relation from Emily Saves America and the feminist
(42:22) writer and author of I Don't the Case against Marriage Clementine Ford so welcome to all of you um Andrew great to
(42:30) have you back on Uncensored are are you remotely apprehensive about unleashing Mrs wilson on the world like this
(42:38) no um but she is the only Wilson on the panel that I claim i'm just just pointing it out
(42:45) everyone seems to be either called Wilson or Emily in this debate um in this two-header Rachel welcome to
(42:50) Uncensored you reached out to me on X and and very boldly said "If you want to
(42:56) debate this properly get me on you're here how are you feeling about this?"
(43:01) Well thank you for having me peers and thank you Andrew for unchaining me from the stove just long enough to appear
(43:07) today i got a day pass from the patriarchy patriarchy is benevolent
(43:12) so true yeah so I'm very happy to be here uh people love to attack my husband
(43:18) via me i'm I'm like the favorite way to do that so I thought why not come on and and talk to people myself so look Rachel
(43:25) let's let's cut to the quick a lot of Andrew's critics not me a lot of his critics say that he's an obvious blatant
(43:33) misogynist he thinks all women should be you know kept at home working can I Can I Can
(43:40) I Can I get myself in trouble a little bit can I tell you guys what I actually
(43:47) think about this no one can get mad at me okay i think
(43:54) that Andrew Wilson might act like a big dominant man but I would bet all the
(44:02) money in my bank account that Andrew Wilson's wife has more control over
(44:08) things that go on in that house than they would like to let people think
(44:14) i just get the sense that she is not submissive it's kind of one of those things where maybe she's like topping
(44:21) from the bottom sort of thing but remember like if we're talking about like you know dominant submissive
(44:29) relationships the submissive is the submissive because they are allowing the
(44:34) dominant to dominate them because they're allowing it they're agreeing to it and I just don't get the impression
(44:42) that Rachel Wilson is actually really that submissive i get the impression that she's more dominant and I would bet
(44:50) you that maybe when Andrew is not on camera on the internet he kind of um
(44:56) likes that because life is about balance and life is about dichotomy and sometimes we present an image to the
(45:03) world that isn't actually you know what's going on behind the scenes because we need to balance those things
(45:11) out she invited herself on the panel exactly
(45:20) away on the stove the housework whatever it may be uh and know their place in life you are actually married to him
(45:27) you've been subject to mockery inadvertently through the last debate we had about this for having to endure
(45:34) being his wife what is it like being married to Andrew Wilson well it's pretty awesome i mean he's
(45:41) hilarious he's really smart guy he's very charming and most of all he's a great dad and a great husband and I
(45:48) share his worldview so I I would agree in fact I would say I would probably be the more bitter misogynist out of the
(45:55) two of us if you really had to like pick one it would probably be me so really why do you say that i just think that
(46:02) feminism has absolutely destroyed so much of what I hold dear in life and it's held me back more than it's helped
(46:09) me it's one of the reasons I started looking into the history and investigating it for myself and I think
(46:14) it's just created a a a world where we now have a two-income economy and for
(46:20) women like me who do want to prioritize motherhood it makes it extremely hard it just makes it financially difficult i
(46:27) faced tons of social pressure had my first daughter at 20 wanted to stay home
(46:32) everyone around me even the so-called Christian conservative women told me it was a terrible idea you can't do that
(46:38) you have to bring the baby to daycare you're going to put yourself at risk you know the your husband's going to hurt
(46:44) you you're going to be abused if you don't have your own money and your own career and I think it's backwards i
(46:49) think it's the most inefficient stupid thing we've ever come up with and that in the future people look back at the
(46:55) feminist experiment as a goofy time in history where we tried this wild experiment that failed miserably and
(47:02) thank God it's over wow okay okay well Clementine Ford I'm sure that you agree with every word of that don't you
(47:10) um firstly I'm very glad that you're happily married it's great you know a lot of women are not happily married and
(47:16) they find it very difficult to leave marriages particularly because of the financial strain so good for you um I do
(47:23) think that your historical understanding of feminism is extremely skewed the idea
(47:28) that somehow we have only created a two-income household because feminism has tried to destroy the world is
(47:34) historically inaccurate see here's the problem though here's the problem no matter how much I dislike Rachel Wilson
(47:41) I'm going to dislike this feminist bitch more she's already annoying me rachel Wilson's fine like she's not saying
(47:47) anything really offensive yet she's fine like whatever she's obviously the dominant person in their marriage but like whatever this feminist bitch is
(47:53) going to really annoy me and and Lord help that blonde Trump supporter when she starts talking cuz I I don't even
(47:59) want to listen to what she has to say um in large part well firstly you're
(48:04) also talking about feminism from your very and when I say limited I'm not
(48:09) trying to insult you but the limited perspective of feminism in America and the understanding of the economy in
(48:15) America it's not taking into account the global reality of the fact that women
(48:20) have always worked women still continue to work women for the most part produce the majority of the world's underpaid if
(48:28) you know drastically underpaid labor um when you talk about a twoinome household
(48:33) being somehow instituted by feminism you're failing to take into account that even in America you know the the kind of
(48:41) the glamorization of this golden age of marriage in the 1950s to the early See and this is the thing this is the thing
(48:48) that the right-wingers don't want people to understand they want women to boss them around every once in a while maybe
(48:55) not all the time maybe they want to be left alone to go hang out with their friends and they don't want to be nagged by their wives to do stuff or over
(49:02) stupid things but sometimes I'm just
(49:10) saying 1960s which the marriage historian Stephanie Coups calls the long decade this coincided with an increase
(49:18) in women in the workplace so it's not it's not as if there was this golden age where women went ma went w where married
(49:25) women sorry weren't working for a lot of that actually the
(49:30) labor that is required to support the middle class is uh has always been
(49:36) relied on for poor and disenfranchised women largely in America black women
(49:42) start so she's a socialist that's making the argument about social reproduction theory which says that women do the
(49:48) unpaid labor of raising the proletarian Ian workers that are the children in the nuclear family which raises them with
(49:53) capitalist values and they're not being paid to raise the children and so therefore they are unpaid labor or undervalued labor
(50:02) let me just let me just finish let me just finish we all have to speed things up a little bit and the the economy the
(50:07) downturn in the economy the the boom that happened after the second world war was unsustainable it was a wonderful
(50:13) time between around 1940 to 1974 white working-class men in particular and then
(50:19) it began to I have a question for you one of the reasons why women had to go into the
(50:24) workforce because they had to help look at this look at this the men are already Look at
(50:35) This is the near perfect freeze frame this is the perfect freeze frame for literally every single person on the
(50:43) [Laughter] panel the men are already tired of the
(50:49) feminist talking both Piers and Andrew are already about to lose it andrew Wilson's wife is about to lose
(50:56) it i have a question for you Clementine it's a very simple question but I think it'll be an interesting question to ask
(51:02) you what is a woman oh God god is I'm not going down the path of debating
(51:08) trans women with you trans women i asked you what a woman is okay I'll tell you but I know that
(51:13) because this is your tactic this is what you do what is a woman i'll tell you controversial i'll tell you I'll tell
(51:20) you I'll tell you what a woman is a woman is someone who has at least at one point in her life felt scared of a man
(51:28) what sorry so So you But you guys never want to talk about Wait hang on hang on you guys say you've ever heard so men
(51:34) any man who's ever felt afraid of another man is a woman yeah exactly talking about what I'm saying you know
(51:41) this is exactly why you're wearing that shirt that says repeal you should put the 19th under it it's this unbelievable
(51:47) what are you talking about a woman any anybody who has ever at one point been afraid of a It's the stupidest thing
(51:54) I've ever heard do you have an actual argument here no would you let me finish speaking or do you How long is it going
(51:59) to take for you to finish reclaim my How long is it going to take for you to finish yes do you really just invite
(52:04) people on your show to be interrupted like this well look all due respect we did do a bit of research into what you said about me in the past so I think I'm
(52:11) entitled to give you No you already know what I think about that question because I've written about you asking that
(52:16) question yes you have in fact you said like all of the Why would you ask it again when you know what my answer just
(52:22) to enlighten the audience who have no idea what you're talking about or me like all of the bigots that's me apparently currently jumping on the
(52:28) transphobic shuttle to Ding-Dong Station morgan wants you to believe this is about fairness and equality specifically
(52:35) fairness equality in women's sports that was exactly what it was about and the problem is Clementine with all due
(52:41) respect to you uh the reality is I I doubt it i doubt it's going with due respect treat you with perfect respect
(52:48) but your inability to just simply state what a woman actually is particularly
(52:53) given two weeks ago in the UK the Supreme Court made it very pop quiz for my chat why do socialists never buy into
(53:02) the what is a woman argument why is this a horrible owning the libs moment that the right uses when they don't
(53:08) understand what they're talking about just for the new people why might a socialist not engage with the what is a
(53:15) woman argument it's not because they can't let's see who's been paying attention on socialism streams and who
(53:22) hasn't been why is why is what is a woman a dumbass question to ask queer Marxists
(53:28) which is what this person obviously is socialists don't believe in gender they don't believe in gender they don't want
(53:35) any genders they believe that gender is a madeup social construct and so when you're asking them what is a woman
(53:41) you're basically asking them about a fictional category that they don't believe is real queer communists believe
(53:47) that gender doesn't exist they believe that gender doesn't exist it's a social construct they want to abolish it
(53:53) entirely they want to abolish men and they want to abolish women that is why it is a stupid question it is a stupid
(54:00) owning the libs question because it fundamentally misunderstands what these
(54:05) people believe anyway clear that a woman is a biological
(54:10) female that's it it's a scientific fact the fact that you can't answer that is part of the problem i would like to No
(54:17) the thing is that I would like to know why you in particular are so obsessed
(54:23) with this definition of what a woman is firstly how does it impact you in any way secondly I have a 13-year-old
(54:30) daughter i have a 13-year-old daughter and if my 13-year-old daughter decides she wants to come back as a you ask me a
(54:36) question you ask me a question I'm gonna answer it well if you don't want an answer don't ask me a question here's my
(54:42) answer to your question i have a 13-year-old hang on so Unknown is saying "So when they say there are many genders
(54:48) they actually don't believe it." So no okay so they believe that gender is not a real thing they believe that gender is
(54:54) a construct is a madeup thing created by capitalism um in order to create oppressive hierarchies essentially and
(55:01) so in the left's ideal world they want to actually get rid of all categories but there's a reason you might not
(55:08) understand that because right now they're kind of in a transitionary stage where they're okay
(55:15) with using some categories but if you listen to what they say about it it is with the express understanding that they
(55:21) want to get rid of all categories eventually so for example non-binary is their non-gendered category right
(55:28) non-binary means no binary no men no women so they're using the category of non-binary right now but they also say
(55:36) eventually they just want to get rid of that too they want no categories for anything because categories create hierarchies hierarchies create
(55:42) oppression this is all like advanced socialism stuff you guys can come to my socialism streams if you want to know more about that but I'm happy to answer
(55:49) questions in the chat too they don't believe um they don't believe in gender or biological sex they don't believe
(55:54) that biology is biology essentially anyway
(56:01) you are not I have a 13-year-old daughter i have seven nieces no they
(56:06) want to get rid of men and women so right now they're talking non-binary is a way to abolish the gender binary so
(56:12) they want to get eventually get rid of all men and all women and all other categories entirely
(56:20) right and some of them are very expert if I may answer your question some of them are very good at sport right the
(56:27) idea that they would one day have their dream of potentially an Olympic place or
(56:32) a team GB place whatever it may be a world championship place taken from them
(56:37) by a biological male I think is completely outrageous and by the way so
(56:43) does most of the world now which is why there's been a reversing screeching U-turn on this particular subject but I
(56:49) come back to my question to you your inability to say what a woman is and yet here you are lecturing women on how they
(56:56) should behave as women is completely perverse
(57:02) i think that reducing women specifically to your biological dec
(57:10) it's called science it's their chromosome did you see she had a socialist tattoo on her
(57:16) arm watch her arm when she brushes her hair that reducing women specifically to
(57:21) your biological disciples you think a woman is because you she's got socialist
(57:27) tattoos on her arm you can barely see them but you can see they're there so socialists have a very specific
(57:32) tattooing style if you see really bad black line tattoos on someone's arm it's
(57:37) not not everyone who has bad black line tattoos on their arm are socialist but a
(57:42) lot of socialists and a lot of queer Marxists explicitly have bad line blackos dad black line tattoos on their
(57:51) arms it's called science it's their chromosomes you have
(57:57) different chromosomes to me it's not me saying that i'm not writing the first
(58:02) writing the science i'm not the first person i'm sure I'm not the first person to tell you about interex people oh my
(58:08) god how do you interex people no no no this is all wrong anyway interex is not
(58:13) a third sex it's not a third sex that's ridiculous there is no third sex there's two sexes male female categorized
(58:20) scientifically interex is not a third sex anybody can look that up in 5 seconds total lie how did you not know
(58:28) that by the way how did you not know interex is not a third sex i didn't say that interex with a with a sex you did
(58:35) but interex the implication was and interex people have interex people can
(58:41) have a mixture of chromosomes so if you if you are you saying they're a third sex or aren't you if you present to the
(58:47) world as if they're not a third sex then there's you have no argument here do you
(58:53) understand that if he's what he's saying is this is what is objective trans women so obsessed with why you so
(59:01) obsessed with answer the question for a start everyone has
(59:06) interrupted me let me speak you just asked a question and then refusing to allow
(59:13) people to answer if you don't ask a question the truth about the truth about
(59:18) the the problem is the problem is feminists in particular I've noticed feminists have latched on over the last
(59:25) few years to this idea that If anybody raised any concerns about the way the
(59:31) trans lobby was trying to make things unequal unfair and unsafe for actual
(59:36) women then they were immediately transphobic i kept saying "I want trans people to have the exact same rights to
(59:43) fairness equality and safety as me or you." However what was happening was
(59:49) women's rights were being eroded so that things were not fair they weren't equal and they weren't safe and we saw
(59:55) absolute parodies of this in the Olympics in the boxing ring where people
(1:00:00) who have been banned from the World Championships because they apparently reported positive for male chromosomes
(1:00:06) were getting in the ring and beating women up in the ring and so a woman's going to die if this was allowed to
(1:00:12) carry on see but but here's the thing and here's why this happens this happens because Piers Morgan and Andrew Wilson
(1:00:19) and Andrew Wilson's wife this blonde MAGA woman is immaterial it kind of seems like they're all speaking a
(1:00:25) completely different language than the blonde woman so there are actually questions that Piers Morgan and all the
(1:00:30) rest of them can ask that blonde woman that would force her into an answer that she doesn't want to give but what is a
(1:00:37) woman is not one of those questions because what are the w what is a woman is comes from like the conservative
(1:00:43) owning the libs perspective whereas the blonde woman who is obviously and clearly a queer Marxist has a completely
(1:00:50) different set of vocabulary so she cares about fundamentally different things she sees the world in a fundamentally
(1:00:56) different way if Piers Morgan or Andrew Wilson or his wife asked her the right questions it would really force her into
(1:01:01) a tough spot but none of them understand enough about the left to know that they're not asking the right questions
(1:01:07) andrew I think is closer than most but Piers Morgan doesn't know what the f he's talking about and so if they took
(1:01:14) some time to just learn about the enemy they claim to be fighting they would actually put themselves in a much better
(1:01:20) position to force these people's feet to the fire but since they're not interested in doing that and they're just interested in owning the libs we
(1:01:27) get this slop where it's like the the leftist doesn't answer the question because the leftist doesn't understand
(1:01:32) the question because they are speaking a completely different language and have a completely different set of values and all the right needs to do is understand
(1:01:38) the enemy that they're fighting to force them into a really tough spot on the TV and they don't do it
(1:01:45) so now people have stopped it now sporting bodies around the world have stopped it but you Clementine I say this
(1:01:51) respectfully are still flying the flag for this bullshit and you can't even say what a woman is and I just find the fact
(1:01:57) that you want to lecture women like Rachel on how they should be as a woman is completely perverse given you don't
(1:02:05) even know or don't want to say what an actual woman is anything to Rachel i
(1:02:10) haven't said anything to Rachel i've never met Rachel before in my life until today well you responded to what she you
(1:02:15) responded to what she said about the the role of a woman lecturing her i wasn't lecturing her it sounded like you lecturing to me let me bring in Emily
(1:02:22) let me bring in Emily i was actually telling I was Let me bring in Emily waiting pat historical reality of economics in the US let me bring in
(1:02:28) Emily you wanted to divert it to talk about trans women because that's clearly No you banged on about trans women i
(1:02:34) just said to you if you don't know what a woman is we've got the question no I I just she's wrong
(1:02:41) about the the economic history she's the one looking at it through an economic prism that's extremely narrow she's
(1:02:47) using feminist standpoint theory to try to tell us what the history of economics is she can't explain to us why all of
(1:02:54) human history and all that's not actually what she's doing at all Rachel but again Rachel doesn't
(1:03:00) know what language she's speaking either so and listen Rachel might have a very good understanding of the economic
(1:03:05) history of feminism i don't fucking know and to be honest I don't really care but that's not what the blonde woman is
(1:03:11) talking about the blonde woman is talking about capitalism which is defined as private property ownership which is perpetuated in the nuclear
(1:03:16) family which is why she doesn't want marriage it's also perpetuated by the gender binary which was created by capitalism in the first place which is
(1:03:23) why she doesn't want to admit what a woman is and Rachel is speaking a completely different language than she is and she doesn't understand that which
(1:03:29) is why they're going like this they're saying two completely they're making two completely different arguments
(1:03:37) excuse me ma'am you talk plenty lady you talk plenty why through all of western history we were able to raise a family
(1:03:44) like a janitor could raise a family with four children on up until 1970 what
(1:03:50) happened in 1970 we pushed women into the workforce in huge numbers and we practically doubled the workforce
(1:03:57) overnight by pushing mothers and women into the workforce uh this happened right alongside the creation of gender
(1:04:03) studies as an academic discipline and now we are in a situation where we don't have a family economy we have an
(1:04:09) individual income economy which means most people can't raise a family without both parents working okay let me bring
(1:04:15) in Emily's been waiting very patiently uh Emily uh good to see you again now you started a kind of MAGA civil war
(1:04:23) when you railed against women who want to be a trad wife uh you posted a Tik Tok video which caused a lot of mayhem
(1:04:29) let's take a look at this i'm sorry i hate to call out my own party but the young girls on the right
(1:04:36) promoting this like tradife bullshit i just That's great i'm all for it i
(1:04:43) promote traditional values i understand i have been working since I was very young i don't really plan on stop being
(1:04:49) working i suggest you find a hobby that makes you money but you guys guess what
(1:04:55) guess what baby girl that lifestyle working out a man a provider you just get to sit at home and bake bread every day slim to none i would say none that
(1:05:03) that's going to work out for you or quite literally anyone you know you're actually setting yourself up for failure
(1:05:09) because it could not be easier if that's what you're going to pursue to be trapped by a man okay also let's bring
(1:05:16) some other things to the table besides sourdough let's let's guys want to be mentally stimulated as well as physical
(1:05:24) okay but I'm just like please you guys are too young to be promoting this and also by the way it's cringe you guys are
(1:05:30) cringe okay now Emily are you are you standing proudly by that Tik Tok
(1:05:39) um thank you guys for laughing uh that is supposed to be the point of a lot of my videos i don't take things too
(1:05:45) seriously i usually say things like this and don't think anything of it um I do want to point out in the video I did
(1:05:51) start it by being like look I love stay-at-home moms i support them i promote conservative values um I think
(1:05:57) the issue with the video is a lot of people just took the video and then gave their own meaning the group I was
(1:06:03) specifically bashing on was the young girls in their 20s that promote like traditional lifestyles online that we
(1:06:09) all know in the right-wing community absolutely do not live these lifestyles and it's just a bit over the top it's
(1:06:16) kind of more cosplay than anything so of course I support moms that do that i just don't support the girls pretending
(1:06:22) to do it i guess if that kind of makes sense i'm not sure it does andrew does it make sense to you well I mean here
(1:06:28) here's the thing though and I actually don't disagree that it would be really difficult for someone to find a situation to be like a stay-at-home wife
(1:06:35) nowadays but it's kind of like maybe the young girls promoting it
(1:06:41) are doing like a fake it till you make it sort of thing maybe they can't get there yet but if they talk about it more and they visualize it more because it's
(1:06:47) what they really want maybe they're trying to fake it till you make it and why shouldn't they be allowed to do that why shouldn't they be able to say this
(1:06:54) is the type of situation I want in the world without getting shit on by someone
(1:06:59) on their own side well I mean she's right in a sense that there's a lot of laring that goes
(1:07:05) on on the right with the supposed traditional movement which she's absolutely right isn't living the
(1:07:12) traditional lifestyle however it's still a counterintuitive message to put out there that oh you're going to be trapped
(1:07:17) by your husband and his income it's like good don't you want to be in a relationship with your husband and have
(1:07:23) access to his income like what's the problem here that would be the values you're trying to move towards right so I
(1:07:29) ultimately it's a contradicting message i understand why you got a bunch of garbage for it it is a good idea I think
(1:07:34) to point out the LAR a good idea to point out how much faux traditionalism
(1:07:40) is on the right because it's a way for them to pedal sex and that's exactly what they're doing you see them in skimpy outfits doing exactly that
(1:07:46) totally fair but on the other hand you absolutely should not be putting out a message which ridicules women for
(1:07:52) wanting to be stay-at-home moms and actually live some type of lifestyle which is conducive to their children and
(1:07:58) family that's Hang on there's a question in the chat would you say the reason why the left got so bad was because of the
(1:08:03) authoritarian exclusively type environment that Jewish intellectuals um so first of all it was not exclusively
(1:08:09) Jewish intellectuals i wouldn't say now I would say that it was the majority Jewish intellectuals um so yeah I mean
(1:08:16) the Frankfurt school coming over which was mostly Jewish intellectuals in the 1930s and setting up shop at Columbia
(1:08:21) University elicited a lot of it um they took over the universities that gave them the K through2 schools that gave
(1:08:27) them the culture by the time the 70s rolled around you basically had your first generation of teachers in the K-
(1:08:32) through2 public schools that had been educated to be teachers by Marxists and
(1:08:37) so that problem has only gotten worse so yeah I think it it it almost all stems from academia but I also don't want to
(1:08:43) give the impression that even though the majority of the people who brought it to the United States were in fact Jewish I
(1:08:50) also don't want to give the impression that I think this is an entirely Jewish problem because I don't i think that
(1:08:55) maybe that's where it started i wrote a book about this called a brief history of racism um where I laid all this out
(1:09:01) basically um but uh but the the reality is today is it is perpetuated by a lot
(1:09:07) of people who are not Jewish and I think saying it's Jewish it's Jewish it's Jew it's Jewish it actually offuscates from
(1:09:13) what the real problem is that we have to deal with today so while I do understand your perspective I guess on that point I
(1:09:19) would have to respectfully disagree that's silly let's play at this stage
(1:09:26) the clip i mean also trapped is just the wrong word to use but overall my message
(1:09:31) I stand by okay I want to play because I think it fits in well here the Caroline Levit clip this is uh where she's
(1:09:38) working with her baby i'll just show the picture of her working at the White House with a baby in one hand and
(1:09:44) helping to run the country with the other now when I first s saw that picture I thought "Wow that's a pretty extraordinary powerful image of a young
(1:09:51) woman who's very young to be doing the incredibly important job she does she does it I think extraordinarily well and
(1:09:58) she's a mother uh and she's feeding her son whilst doing this at the same time." Um Rachel when you saw that image it got
(1:10:05) a lot of blowback good and bad you know some people loved it some people hated it what did you think about it well I
(1:10:12) actually tweeted about this too because although I'm a big fan Okay okay can I give Andrew Wilson a
(1:10:19) W i fucking love that Andrew Wilson is smoking while being on Piers Morgan i
(1:10:28) love that i love like when Okay you can take issue with Edward Aruro fine like
(1:10:33) he was obviously a leftist but I love the old school news broadcast where Edward Aruro is smoking while he's
(1:10:40) delivering the news and he has the ashtray on his uh on his desk it's just like it's a it's a ballsy
(1:10:47) move man like it just it shows the size of Andrew Wilson's penis so I'm sure that uh Rachel is very happy with that
(1:10:54) but it's like that's like a power move and to just like fucking smoke on someone's show i love it got it well I
(1:11:01) actually tweeted about this too because although I'm a big fan of Caroline as a person I think she's great she's smart
(1:11:08) she's lovely I don't understand this compulsion especially in the Trump administration but on the right in
(1:11:14) general where we're supposed to be conservatives where we are pushing mothers to work trump has been a huge
(1:11:21) proponent of hiring women getting women back to work as soon as possible after having the baby and I think this is um
(1:11:27) What do I think of Jay Dyer i guess I don't really have an opinion of him to be honest i don't really know that much about him i know that he's like a
(1:11:33) Christian apologist or something but I've never really watched much of his content or anything like that so I guess
(1:11:38) I don't really have an opinion is a huge mistake because number one what are we conserving if we're not
(1:11:45) conserving the traditional family and traditional gender roles and motherhood
(1:11:51) in the in the middle of a birth rate crisis what are we conserving as conservatives just like lower taxes i
(1:11:58) mean this is should be a core issue for us on the right to say "No motherhood is
(1:12:03) not a part-time gig that you do on the side you don't you know ship your baby off to daycare where they're spending
(1:12:09) three times as much time with a low-wage daycare worker as they are with mom while you go and do your career there's
(1:12:15) plenty of life to live after raising kids i think after you've done that if you want to venture out and do a few
(1:12:21) more things once you have the empty nest I think that's okay but pushing mothers to work is it's one of the key things
(1:12:28) that's tearing apart the fabric of society because we're not raising our own children we're not passing down our values to them we're sending them to
(1:12:35) daycare and we're sending them to state-run schools and that's who they're being raised by all right Clementine
(1:12:41) your response to that i don't disagree with anything she said do you work
(1:12:46) Rachel no you don't make any money from your
(1:12:51) podcasting i make some money but I do maybe you do do some form of paid
(1:12:59) employment yes first of all my children are grown up now i'm 44 years old so I
(1:13:04) had my first one at 20 they're grown up they're moved out but I I work still very very part-time maybe a couple hours
(1:13:11) a week at most but do you have because my my primary responsibility is to my husband
(1:13:17) so you you've got five children right is that correct and they're all grown up and all moved out or you've still got
(1:13:24) some young children the youngest couple at home and by the way just making an argument from
(1:13:30) hypocrisy can I can I just ask the hypocrisy can I just ask you can I just ask you do you find even with the small
(1:13:36) amount of part-time work that you do which you do get paid for do you find satisfaction from that do you get
(1:13:43) satisfaction from that work it's not the money because Andrew makes far more than I make i make a very very tiny amount of
(1:13:49) money off of you know my book and a a couple of appearances here and there might sell a few books it's it's
(1:13:55) practically nothing if I was doing it for the money it'd be a waste of even the couple of hours but what I would
(1:14:01) what I would say to that is we're not against women doing other things so if you look at the Bible in the Proverbs 31
(1:14:07) woman she does a lot of things she's out buying land she's making decisions she's doing all kinds of things the difference
(1:14:14) is that she's doing them under the purview of the guidance and leadership of her husband and for her family not
(1:14:20) for a corporation not for her own glory not for her own ambition
(1:14:26) a lot of that depends on whether or not you whether or not you have faith in the Bible which obviously not everyone does
(1:14:32) no it doesn't but the reason I asked you those questions wasn't because I was trying to set you up or anything like that it doesn't surprise me that you
(1:14:38) would get some satisfaction to me the point of the question wasn't about the money it's about the work it's about the
(1:14:45) the passion that you put into it and the reason I asked was because a multi-year study done by Adrianne Frick and Sarah
(1:14:51) de Damasque sorry found that the mental health of women who worked full-time after the birth of their first child was
(1:14:57) significantly higher than those who didn't have paid work at all so I think that taking into account the fact that
(1:15:04) for a lot of women and this is also what Betty Fredane found when she wrote the feminine mystique that and Stephanie Coots backed this up as well in her book
(1:15:10) the way we never were which is a history of a Are you married i have no idea about your situation but are you married
(1:15:16) do you have kids what's what's your deal i've I've got a kid i'm not married okay but you have a I'm a I'm a single mother
(1:15:23) okay and I have a very excellent relationship with my son's father we
(1:15:28) co-parent together very well but we're not married we don't live together um I certainly have found since having a
(1:15:35) child I mean I' I've always worked anyway but I've been working since I was 13 years old but I've always found that
(1:15:40) work for me is very satisfying and the what I'm saying is that these are the findings of multiple historians
(1:15:46) anthropologist scientists that these are the findings of diehard feminists who are only investigating this from a
(1:15:53) feminist point of view they're already sold on the ideology and what they do cherrypicked data she's a worldrenowned
(1:15:59) historian she's not specifically a feminist she's a worldrenowned historian and these are the these were her
(1:16:05) findings as well so you cannot deny the reality if you look at say that women can't do anything else we're not we're
(1:16:13) not saying that you can never leave the house we're we're not saying you can't have other fulfilling that you're suggesting
(1:16:21) that the primary role for a woman and that you know in your faith I'm not going to discredit that but your faith
(1:16:26) in God says that this is what you believe God says that you should be doing but that the primary role for a woman is that she should be staying at
(1:16:33) home that she should be devoted to her husband she should be devoted to her children that the facts do not back that
(1:16:39) up the facts of of familial satisfaction don't back that
(1:16:45) up they do hang on sorry I I think you've chosen the wrong moment to say
(1:16:51) that you've clearly got a woman here on the panel where the facts completely
(1:16:56) back that up she's had a load of kids very happily married that there would be exceptions
(1:17:01) to the rule but statistically speaking well you've just literally got one sitting there in front of That's
(1:17:07) completely untrue though to say that this one study that this one survey is
(1:17:12) going to tell us something first of all we have two multi world it was a multi-year study let me let me ask you
(1:17:18) let me let me ask the question that you want to ask anytime some leftist tries to uh nail you on there was this study
(1:17:25) about this or was this study about that is every single study has what's called inclusion and exclusion criteria which
(1:17:33) is here are the populations that this applies to for reason X Y and Z here are
(1:17:38) the populations this does not apply to for reason X Y and Z and it usually ends up going back to how they made the
(1:17:44) sample for the study and almost in every single case especially when you have multi-year studies like this you're
(1:17:50) going to have a really really really fuckoff narrow segment of people that this study
(1:17:55) actually applies to but when they talk about it on things like news shows they try to make it seem like it's broadly
(1:18:00) generalizable when in fact most studies are not broadly generalizable to the larger population so if you really want
(1:18:06) to get get them caught and make them admit that they don't know what the fuck they're talking about ask them what is
(1:18:12) the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study and what populations explicitly does this study apply to and
(1:18:19) I promise you they are never going to be able to answer that question but it is in every single study or it should be in
(1:18:24) every single study sorry when you were uh were you married or not i I can't
(1:18:30) remember what you said were you married no I've never been married okay when you were with your partner before you broke up who did the household chores and
(1:18:36) stuff like that i mean how did you delineate that as a feminist it was a struggle because even in lots
(1:18:44) of supposedly egalitarian households and you know again the data backs up that women even women who make more money
(1:18:51) than their partners or their spouses tend to do more unpaid domestic labor this is the this who did who did most
(1:18:58) who did most of the domestic chores in my house yeah me you did me okay and
(1:19:06) Rachel who does most of them in your house so that's the reality for Hang on hang on hang on rachel who does the Who does who does the domestic stuff in your
(1:19:12) house rachel I do absolutely all of it and the thing I want to say to So you're very similar i mean it seems to me
(1:19:19) you're both I care I care far less about women's fulfillment in careers than I
(1:19:24) care about children and how they're being raised and I want her to justify to me why we should be paying low-wage
(1:19:30) daycare workers to raise our children rather than doing it ourselves how does it make sense to take your duty of
(1:19:36) motherhood and simply put it on a different random woman how does that system make sense why should women to do
(1:19:42) that i agree with her if you would like to stay at home and raise your children that's you're not you're not answering
(1:19:48) the question the question is good for children it's a question of choice for them to be raised by choice it's
(1:19:54) actually not worse it's not worse outcome to be raised by working mothers
(1:19:59) that's also the the the facts back that up there is no
(1:20:04) suggest listen lady children who are less happy that is not true there are no facts on planet earth that back up that
(1:20:11) single mother households have better outcomes that's one too that outsourcing your specific let me
(1:20:19) finish you bring if you outsource the raising of your children you're already making yourself a single mother just so
(1:20:25) you know here's what's going on just that you
(1:20:31) understand I am so tired of her talking I am so tired of her talking she
(1:20:38) needs to just stop talking can she stop talking for like two seconds Lady lady
(1:20:44) excuse me don't call me lady can you let me finish can anybody finish a point can anybody finish a point or only you are
(1:20:51) only you allowed to i'm trying to make one so making a point Andrea if you out
(1:20:57) your children's raising to strangers answer Rachel's question and tell her
(1:21:02) how that makes more sense than having the child raised by their own biological mother actually answer
(1:21:10) well in my case it makes more sense because I need to make money to pay my bills to raise my child
(1:21:18) it makes what if you depended on your husband's income do you see the problem of how we end my turn to finish now it's
(1:21:25) my turn to finish but actually again if you if you if you knew what you were
(1:21:31) talking about if you actually if you actually read anything about the data on these things rather than just reaching
(1:21:37) into your gut for a feeling that feels the data show me the data that shows that if you outsource child
(1:21:46) let me bring Emily in because Emily's being again Emily Hang on there's no statistical data to support the fact
(1:21:51) that children raised by mothers who work are less happy than children raised by
(1:21:56) Yes there There's tons of damage is anyone surprised that this woman is
(1:22:05) single listen can I just can I just I I I've been married for almost 14
(1:22:13) years and so I feel like I'm in a position to give women advice if they want to have like I I feel like I've
(1:22:19) reached the point where I can say I have a successful marriage i've been married for a long time my husband and I still
(1:22:26) have sex and we still love each other and all that stuff and we're not going to get divorced and all this stuff because mostly because we're terrified
(1:22:31) of dating again i think I think that would the the prospect of having to date in today's environment is one of the
(1:22:38) biggest aversions to divorce ever not that I don't love my husband and I I do want to keep him around and stuff but
(1:22:43) anyway I feel like I'm in a position to give people marriage advice now because I've been married for so effing long
(1:22:49) do you want to know what is one of the easiest ways to have a successful marriage in which everyone is happy
(1:22:57) don't be an annoying bitch listen I know that I can kind of be a pain in the ass
(1:23:02) on the internet i understand that but I like to think and my husband is free to
(1:23:08) text me from the downstairs if I'm wrong about this I like to think I am not an
(1:23:13) annoying bitch in real life and I'm actually pretty laidback and mostly I let my husband do what he wants he's
(1:23:19) going to go out actually he might not even be here right now he's going to go out with friends later to have drinks i'm not pitching a fit about it he can
(1:23:26) go hang out with his friends i don't care he can go do what just like just keep your fucking mouth shut and don't
(1:23:33) be annoying and maybe make him a sandwich every now and again and maybe give him a blowjob every now and again
(1:23:38) and and all that stuff and and that's really all you have to do in order to have a successful marri that's it just
(1:23:45) don't be an annoying bitch and it's like so many women just think they need to be the boss bitch at all times and it's
(1:23:54) annoying and men don't like it and men need to feel like they're men sometimes and sometimes like men can be softer and
(1:24:00) they don't like to admit it to their friends and stuff like that but sometimes they can be too but like but like they also like to feel like men and
(1:24:06) they don't like to feel emasculated and so don't do that you don't need to be
(1:24:12) the boss bitch at all times you really really don't a relationship is a two-way
(1:24:18) street and stop Rachel there's so much
(1:24:23) overwhelming children that's her choice to do that is so it's not true that
(1:24:30) because that's her choice let me let me bring in other women let me bring Emily in knows that emily was trying to say
(1:24:36) something you don't want your daughters and your You don't want your daughters and your nieces being forced to stay at home to raise families i don't want I
(1:24:42) don't want I don't want my kids to be forced to do anything no Emily you wanted to say something
(1:24:49) yeah no I mean look I'm not going to argue data with either of you guys i'm sure you know more than me but I can say
(1:24:55) that um my father is my hero and the most important person in my life and I didn't if I didn't have him and he
(1:25:01) wasn't in the household I don't know where I would be today and my girlfriends who were raised without
(1:25:06) fathers in the household I do see them struggle in different ways when it comes to dating and all these different things
(1:25:12) and it's funny because it's like he they do make a point like if there was a father in the household supporting you I
(1:25:17) think a lot of these issues wouldn't be what they are so I think there's points to both of these things okay let me ask
(1:25:24) Andrew andrew but supporting in what way is your name Andrew anyway go ahead Pierce yeah Andrew i was going to ask
(1:25:30) Andrew when Rachel said that she does all domestic chores is there anything you do i mean do you you put the bins
(1:25:35) out do you you know the trash out i mean what what do you do do you do anything i don't do shit
(1:25:41) that's what I got a wife for but not only that but yard work yeah cars need
(1:25:48) repair something like that but I'm not going to do household chores that's what I got married for i don't want to do household chores not only that on top of
(1:25:54) that let's just point a couple things out my husband does like like my like there's man's work around the house like
(1:25:59) if if there's like a plumbing issue or something my husband needs to fix that if there's some sort of like issue
(1:26:05) related to needing a saw or a tool for something my husband can fix that shit
(1:26:10) okay that's the type of stuff that men they should be doing if if something heavy needs to be moved from one room to
(1:26:17) another like there's work that men can do
(1:26:22) no she's absolutely wrong here's what the stats actually say that if a child is raised in Can I tell you guys a story
(1:26:29) one time okay so one time one time we had a toilet in the house that needed to
(1:26:34) be replaced and my husband was like "Yeah I'm just going to go buy a new toilet i'm just going to replace it
(1:26:39) myself." And I was like "You know how to replace toilets?" And he's like "Yeah yeah yeah i I totally got this it's going to be fine." And so I was like
(1:26:45) "All right well you're the man i'm not going to get involved if you want to replace the toilet by yourself I don't really care just don't fuck up anything
(1:26:52) and I don't really care." And so my husband goes off and he gets all the things that he needs to get and apparently he needed to get a new tool
(1:26:58) or something and obviously had to buy the toilet anyway so so it's hours later and my husband has set up in the
(1:27:04) bathroom which is like literally right next to my office in order to replace the toilet and so I'm sitting in my
(1:27:11) office doing work and I hear out of the bathroom I hear out of the bathroom my
(1:27:19) husband is watching a YouTube video about how to replace the
(1:27:24) toilet and I hear this video playing it's like how to replace your toilet i
(1:27:30) was like "Victor are you watching a YouTube video
(1:27:35) to learn how to replace the toilet after you assured me you knew how
(1:27:41) to do [Laughter] this?" But to his credit he did actually
(1:27:47) successfully replace the toilet and it all worked out fine in a two parent household they're
(1:27:55) going to have way better outcomes and if they have a present mother who is more
(1:28:00) present with them they're going to have way better outcomes every single data point backs this up the outsourcing of
(1:28:06) children and my husband has just come upstairs and looked at me through my office door like with a smug look on his
(1:28:12) face because he knows too that he did successfully replace the toilet that time [Laughter]
(1:28:17) working to public school especially for eight hours a day is absurd stop let me finish the point finish the point and
(1:28:24) then you can respond let me finish the point i've got to say someone who doesn't like being interrupted you
(1:28:30) interrupt why is it that you won't let me finish the point i got a text from your producer telling me to interrupt if
(1:28:36) I disagreed with anyone okay but I think I think that what's what's changed since that text message is you've made a point
(1:28:43) of objecting to being interrupted so I don't think you can do that and yet I keep and keep interrupting so that's
(1:28:48) just the state of play why don't you practice what you preach and don't interrupt Andrew when he's trying to finish his point yeah so look I've just
(1:28:54) finished the point would he make a point he hasn't made one yet yeah i I just did i made multiple points all the data
(1:28:59) points are made the point that he doesn't respect his lady you still can't stop talking he didn't want to do
(1:29:05) anything so true this is why it should say the 19th under that shirt you cannot even be
(1:29:12) quiet long enough to hear a counterpoint here's the counterpoint your the data you're citing you don't have any when it
(1:29:18) comes to outcomes for children when it comes to outsourcing their raising correct none none correct show me any
(1:29:25) that shows that you sending your kids out which data are you saying would you stop so that I can tell tell me i'm
(1:29:32) trying to at least finish the question yes yeah okay here's the thing one more time all data points to the fact that if
(1:29:40) you outsource the raising of your children especially when they're young say all data you actually have to site
(1:29:46) it site any data that shows that show site any data ever that shows that you
(1:29:52) outsourcing the care of your child is good for the child any
(1:29:57) Yeah that's right nothing you got and Stephanie Coun doesn't say that you're lying three you do you even know who
(1:30:02) Stephanie Kun is yes you mean the feminist writer stephanie the feminist right you don't you see you clearly
(1:30:09) don't even know what you're talking about you you I can tell you don't you're not even interested you're not even interested enough in the topic
(1:30:15) you're not even interested enough to respect I'm sorry who's Stephanie Coun let's make sure we got it right who's Stephanie Coons
(1:30:22) stephanie Coun is an historian worldrenowned historian into marriage
(1:30:27) and the structure and isn't a feminist right isn't a feminist i just want to make sure we're clear i don't I have no
(1:30:32) idea if she's a feminist or not i know that she's an You try to make a reputation about what I'm saying i
(1:30:38) clearly you don't know enough about the topic it's silly i'm only allowed to I'm
(1:30:44) only I'm not allowed to reference historians is that we're only so if you have a historian who's also a feminist I
(1:30:52) just want it to be noted that she has more socialist tattoos on her arms we saw the other arm earlier now we're
(1:30:58) seeing this one and there are more historians is that we're only so if you have a historian who's also a feminist
(1:31:04) only allowed to reference if you have a historian who's also a feminist they're they're biased right let me ask you Clementine Clementine let me ask you why
(1:31:11) I'm so obsessed with whether or not she's a feministine let me ask you question let me try and answer ask a
(1:31:18) question here Clementine do do you hate men no of course I don't hate men absurd
(1:31:25) reductive question why did you tweet that Hang on I hate you why why in 2020 did you tweet
(1:31:32) the Corona virus isn't killing men fast enough i tweeted that in 2020 as a misguided
(1:31:39) tweet but it was actually much of a part of a long misguided tweet corona virus isn't killing men just say you were
(1:31:46) tweeting spicy shit on the internet and it's Twitter and it shouldn't be taken literally this isn't hard you say you
(1:31:52) don't hate men apologize for it Pers you thought a deadly pandemic virus was
(1:31:57) apologized apologize to men again do it again do it again you haven't apologized
(1:32:03) to me for saying that you want me invoking his nomination to consider you a man to apologize you for that say
(1:32:09) you're sorry you don't even know what a woman is i haven't consider you a man andrew to
(1:32:17) apologize to me because I do not appreciate her saying that my own husband does not respect me of course he
(1:32:24) respects me he respects me as a mother and as a wife he treats me like gold who
(1:32:30) the hell are you to tell me if he respects me or not you wouldn't have to get paid for this if you had a husband i
(1:32:36) didn't say that he Where did I even You did you said he clearly doesn't respect you you did say that i heard you say you
(1:32:42) mean the the piece of shit that you're married to yeah he clearly doesn't respect you about how he married you
(1:32:50) he's not the piece of shit in this panel that would be you man you're the one
(1:32:55) listen let's get back to the topic here you're the one who is insisting that there's no data topics that we I would
(1:33:04) hang on i would genuinely like to know you said it was misguided to say like
(1:33:10) you know it takes I'm really getting mad at this
(1:33:15) queer Marxist bitch because she's making me be on Rachel Wilson's side and I don't actually want to be on Rachel
(1:33:21) Wilson's side but there's just no other option there's no other option rachel Wilson is right this MAGA blonde woman
(1:33:28) isn't doing anything andrew is right this blonde woman is wrong piers Piers is just like laughing at this whole
(1:33:34) thing it's not fair coronavirus wasn't killing men fast
(1:33:40) enough why would That's a terrible thing to say terrible thing to say no I understand that the ter Let me finish my
(1:33:47) question i do understand it's a terrible thing to say my my question be amusement why would you say that
(1:33:54) because I was really frustrated with the articles that I was reading about how the pandemic was uh it was derailing
(1:34:02) women's workplace uh um it was derailing women's economic trajectories and there
(1:34:09) was a specific article that I had read about a woman who had founded her own company she was the CEO of it her
(1:34:14) husband had taken a sbatical prior to the pandemic and within two days of child care closing down he said I can't
(1:34:21) take care of the four-year-old and she quit her job to go home and look after the kid what's that got to do with you
(1:34:26) wanting more men to be killed so that's one if you're going to ask me the question then let me finish
(1:34:32) clementine you know what Clementine when you tweet literally Corona virus isn't killing men fast enough i think I'm
(1:34:39) entitled to push you a little see this is the problem this is this is what the
(1:34:44) classical liberals have done to us they have forced us to be on Andrew
(1:34:49) Wilson's side i didn't like couple years ago I didn't like Andrew Wilson i definitely
(1:34:55) didn't like Andrew Wilson's wife and now the classical liberals have fucked things up so badly and they've made a
(1:35:02) sandwich out to be the dissident right and we have no other choice but to be on
(1:35:08) the side of Andrew Wilson and his wife and it's really unfair and it's awful
(1:35:14) and the classical liberals have ruined everything and they they're the classical liberals are worse than the
(1:35:20) communists the classical liberals are worse than the actual Nazis
(1:35:28) yeah see see I was I was actually just saying this like I I love and adore Nick i really do i love Nick Fuentes there
(1:35:34) are some gropers that I like there are some gropers that I don't like but like the classical liberals
(1:35:40) have radicalized me more to the dissident right than Nick Fuentes ever did james Lindsay and his sandwich
(1:35:47) crusade have radicalized me more to the distant right to be like you know maybe
(1:35:52) maybe Nick Fuentes is not right about everything but at least Nick Fuentes
(1:35:58) doesn't believe that a sandwich is literally fascism this is the world we live
(1:36:04) in no I will never watch the Whatever podcast at
(1:36:10) all never again little bit more than it was a bit misguided you're literally
(1:36:15) calling for the mass culling of men while simultaneously pretending you don't hate men come on you know you know
(1:36:23) that don't be disingenuous you know that that's not what I was called hang on to
(1:36:28) be very clear no I am not an atheist i have um I am very very spiritual i am
(1:36:34) not a Christian though and no you will not convert me to Christianity and no you will not convert me to Catholicism
(1:36:39) and please don't proitize to me because I want to be friends but when people prostilitize to me I eventually get
(1:36:45) really pissed off because there is no univer I respect your ability to be a Christian i am not going to be a Christian
(1:36:50) myself never happened before he literally said all men virus
(1:36:58) isn't killing men it was a blip tweet and you know that I also apologized for it shortly after that you know that I
(1:37:03) was sincere in my apology he didn't apologize to me dragging it out 5 years later apologize to Andrew please will
(1:37:09) you apologize to me for doing it i would not apologize to you if I did something
(1:37:15) to you let alone for doing nothing to you if you did something to Was that the
(1:37:21) only time Clementine Clement Hang on hang on hang on hang on hang on i've got a followup i have a followup clementine
(1:37:27) was that was that the only time you've tweeted that that you want all men to be killed
(1:37:34) yes why don't you just say what you want to say no just ask you a question have you have you have tweeted I have tweeted
(1:37:41) prior to that all men as a joke as a joke as a joke so you quite regularly
(1:37:47) think it's funny to say that men should be killed i don't quite regularly there's two there's two examples that
(1:37:52) you can think of yeah you don't hate men but you did tweet kill all menus isn't killing men i put it to you
(1:37:59) oh hang on i've also I put it to you you probably do hate mend
(1:38:05) i've also said that men should be fired into the sun tell me at what point do these very clearly glib and yes I have
(1:38:14) apologized for them very but very clearly glib tweets from a time as well
(1:38:19) where Twitter was such a toxic I don't tweet anymore it's a bad place for everybody
(1:38:25) at what point do those things that be accepted
(1:38:30) as glib misguided regrettable deeply apologetic for them now remarks that you
(1:38:37) would never say again you don't sound very apologetic i think you should just admit that you don't like men to I think
(1:38:43) it's the problem comes when you keep denying like you very much Pierce i I don't care if you like me or not you
(1:38:48) spray gum me in public but you know I mean Piers Piers is right though like if you don't like men just be fucking real
(1:38:55) and say "I don't like men." Just be real like you don't have to lie you don't
(1:39:00) have to say "Well that was a regretable tweet that I tweeted 17 times." Like you
(1:39:06) don't like men who the fuck cares no one's going to marry you anyway because you're annoying bitch
(1:39:13) why couldn't Why do I have to sit here and admit to you that I don't like men what What do you What do you I just
(1:39:19) asked you if you do or not you said you you said you don't hate me you said that I did you spend all your time wanting us to be dead
(1:39:25) hang on she loves me you just got to shoot him in the You don't like me you think Andrew's
(1:39:32) a piece of shit so that's every single man involved in this debate is absurd
(1:39:37) every man every man in this debate Clementine you said you hate relationships with men you shouldn't be giving advice on Emily emily what was
(1:39:45) that so true so I'm saying if you live a life where you've been unsuccessful in
(1:39:50) relationships whether it's friendship love marriage whatever it is I think you're probably the last person in the
(1:39:56) position to be giving advice what women should do with men i mean I don't feel any
(1:40:02) animosity even when it comes to him in friendships and relationships that's a
(1:40:07) very single mom that's a very odd Well being a single mother doesn't mean that I'm unsuccessful in relationships i I
(1:40:13) already said before that I have a very beautiful co-parenting relationship with my son's father he lives in the same apartment building as us we're deeply
(1:40:21) close friends i don't I don't understand why you think that that is
(1:40:26) I'm not bitter towards men at all i'm I'm annoyed at uh I'm annoyed at the
(1:40:32) expectation that some men have some men on this panel have that women should do
(1:40:37) everything for them i'm certainly angry at the fact that in the UK does
(1:40:43) everything I do everything I can my boyfriend I am angry that in the UK a woman is killed every 3 days by a man
(1:40:51) I'm angry that in America three women are killed every day is kind of a
(1:40:58) different one woman is killed every 10 minutes by how many babies do you think
(1:41:05) I'm angry about and I'm angry how many babies do you I'm not saying that one in three girls
(1:41:10) over the age of 15 will experience sexual violence in her lifetime i'm very angry about that statistic i'm angry
(1:41:16) about rape and sexual assault i'm angry about the fact that the most dangerous person to a woman is a man that she
(1:41:22) knows i'm angry about all these things yes but that doesn't mean that I hate men that doesn't mean that I don't want
(1:41:28) to shoot them into men's greatness with women and with
(1:41:33) you want to shoot men into the sun you want them killed by Corona virus and you want all of us dead and you hate both
(1:41:39) the men on the panel other than that you love men we get you love them you love them they're great even though they're being a bunch of
(1:41:45) things that I hate well this my thing is like can't you admit that you at least
(1:41:51) like men enough that they gave you a beautiful child you're super grateful of i mean that's a positive this is
(1:41:56) honestly the one of the most absurd conversations I've ever had in my life i've just sat here and explained that I
(1:42:03) hate men i've just sat here and explained that I have a wonderful relationship with my son's father i've
(1:42:08) just sat here and said you know that that I've apologized for these things that I've said in the past we've all
(1:42:14) said terrible things we've peers you've said terrible things on Twitter we've
(1:42:21) all have What have I said name one oh oh Pierce do you want me to look them up
(1:42:27) right now okay let me just give me a second tell me a terrible thing I said on Twitter pier Morgan while she's
(1:42:33) looking can I refute her fake statistics that she just gave because I hear from terrible opinions there we go i'll look
(1:42:40) at that give me a terrible opinion oh it's Rachel i thought you were
(1:42:46) talking while I'm just scrolling through the No we can all wait clementine the clock is ticking though i mean find one
(1:42:52) terrible thing that I've tweeted oh I think that all lives matter was
(1:42:57) pretty bad you think all lives matter is a bit better than men should be dying faster isn't it let's just compare all
(1:43:04) lives matter against more men should die all lives matter all lives matter is a rejection of black lives matter i didn't
(1:43:11) reject Black Lives Matter i didn't reject Black Lives Matter i didn't reject the I didn't reject Black Lives
(1:43:17) Matter i didn't reject Black Lives Matter don't lie no but you didn't no I
(1:43:23) didn't you see this is the trouble you say that see this is Piers is now losing points for me because if it had been me
(1:43:30) I would have been like "You're goddamn right i rejected Black Lives Matter you crazy bitch."
(1:43:36) Said terrible things when you try and find them you don't have any i'm saying looking at it right here peers all lives
(1:43:42) matter he didn't say white lives matter he said all lives matter which is true in any decent do you not think all lives
(1:43:48) matter clementine is absolutely ridiculous clementine do all lives matter
(1:43:54) i think that all lives deserve respect do they matter i think that in the context do all lives matter Clementine
(1:44:00) you do you know what all lives do matter and thank you thank you and that bombshell but the one terrible thing you
(1:44:08) found I've ever said you completely agree with so on that on that on that
(1:44:13) delightful note will you agree with the one terrible thing that I've ever apparently said we will leave this
(1:44:19) compelling debate thank you all very much indeed i'm going to say Rachel derailed that's it that's it okay okay
(1:44:27) see this isn't even fair this is why I pulled up the second option because Andrew Wilson and his wife won this
(1:44:34) because the feminist was so fucking annoying that there was no way anyone
(1:44:40) was going to be on her side so this is not a good thing by which for me to judge Andrew Wilson because all like
(1:44:46) literally all he did had to do was to basically keep his mouth shut for the whole thing and be less annoying than
(1:44:51) the blonde woman and he did that very successfully okay so W for Andrew Wilson and his wife
(1:44:57) but we're going to watch something else now okay so we're going back into the
(1:45:04) archives for this one we're going to what is it about 10 months ago andrew Wilson debated Adam Green on Ethan
(1:45:10) Ralph's channel and I don't like Ethan Ralph at all in any way but this was I
(1:45:18) think the most recent debate that these two have had correct me if I'm wrong if there's a more recent debate between the
(1:45:24) two of them please tell me because this was the most recent one I could find so if there's a more recent debate between
(1:45:30) Andrew Wilson and Adam Green I actually want to watch that but this was the most recent one I could find that I
(1:45:36) remembered okay so I'm sure people can correct me in the chat if I'm wrong the reason I want to watch this is I
(1:45:45) actually really like Adam Green and I like a lot of Adam Green's ideas and so
(1:45:51) I think that Adam Green is going to is going to is going to You guys didn't see my Is there anything embarrassing in my
(1:45:57) watch history i don't think so nothing embarrassing in my watch history okay well that's that's
(1:46:02) critically important um because I don't really watch that much stuff on Rumble so Okay anyway so I like Adam Green a lot but I
(1:46:12) have questions about some part of what Adam Green teaches and I don't know if
(1:46:18) they're going to address that question specifically in this debate but I was thinking about it and I was like I've never really wa I've watched a lot of
(1:46:24) Adam Green's content but I've never really watched Adam Green get push back
(1:46:31) from someone that I think is like a competent debater on the
(1:46:37) other side and so what I'm interested in seeing in this is this i want to know if
(1:46:43) Andrew Wilson is being a dick in this debate and if he is I'm not gonna like him because I do like Adam Green but I
(1:46:51) also want to see Adam Green's ideas be challenged and I want to see how he reacts to that challenge because I have
(1:46:57) some questions about some of the things that he said and I have not gotten a good answer to those questions yet and I
(1:47:03) feel like I've tried i tried in the DMs i tried on a Twitter space still have not gotten a good answer to my questions
(1:47:10) and I feel like I want to see someone else try to debate him because I mean I don't really care about
(1:47:16) the debate like it's not actually that big of a deal but I just I want to see the interaction so we are going to be
(1:47:23) watching Andrew Wilson versus Adam Green on Ethan Ralph's show and we're just going to watch and we're going to see what's going on i'm almost done my first
(1:47:30) beer so that's going well if you guys are drinking something fun please put it in the chat and let us know i will be
(1:47:36) opening a second beer expeditiously but let's uh let's get into the stream and let's see what happens hello to
(1:47:42) everybody i'll turn it up a little closer how's that test one two
(1:47:49) cheers Andrew crank it up oh he is drinking
(1:47:54) cheers to you i just want it to be known that Adam drink Adam Green drinks far inferior beer to what I drink and Adam
(1:48:00) Green needs to expand his horizons outside of a fucking IPA cuz IPAs suck
(1:48:06) ipas are pissing contests for men who want to see how bitter they can go there's so much better beer in the world
(1:48:13) i know I'm drinking sour right now and you might say Carlin sours are a fruity girly drink well true but it's
(1:48:18) summer but at least I admit it but there are much better beers than an
(1:48:24) IPA you're drinking a Shop Talk Lemons Chandandy that's a pretty girly beer i'm
(1:48:29) not going to lie Mandy but it's a good beer i like Shock Top shock top Shock Top in the in the fall has the pretzel
(1:48:38) beer if you've never had a Shock Top pretzel beer you're missing out it is one of the greatest beers that has ever
(1:48:44) been made and it's only available in the fall and it tastes like a fucking pretzel and it's delicious it's got like
(1:48:51) that salty thing it's just so good it's one of the best beers that you can get that's like mass- prodduced i mean Guinness is fine but
(1:48:59) like if I'm really going to be drinking a stout it's probably not going to be Guinness guinness is fine guinness is fine if like there's you're you're at a
(1:49:05) bar and like there's no craft beer on tap but there are much better stouts than Guinness like you could do like a
(1:49:11) lefthand stout you could do a Founders a Founders Breakfast IPA stout especially if it's on Nitro like there are many
(1:49:17) better stouts in the world than Guinness anyway peanut butter stouts are amazing
(1:49:22) coconut stouts are good but Guinness is fine for an entrylevel beer
(1:49:29) cheers yeah no cheers for me i already took my breathalyzer i already took the breathalyzer i'm not taking another one
(1:49:34) okay now like five minutes ago by the way but
(1:49:40) anyway welcome to both you gentlemen uh I'm glad you can make it i'll show you when I'm in a better spot to show it to
(1:49:46) you months now I guess uh it's been a while and um Andrew to Well you know I
(1:49:53) almost bought a bunch of cider today cer is like next level right now there are so many good cers out there but if you
(1:49:59) really want to Yeah chocolate stouts can be amazing but if you want a pro tip actually you can do this with Guinness
(1:50:05) if you're at a bar that has both Guinness and a hard apple cider on top then what you want to order is uh some
(1:50:11) places call it a snake bite some places call it a black velvetine which is half Guinness half hard cider it's so fucking
(1:50:19) good and there are other things you can mix with Guinness too like some people mix uh Guinness and uh what is the beer
(1:50:25) in Pennsylvania yingling or Guinness and like Magic Had number I haven't had Magic Had number nine in like a long ass
(1:50:31) time i don't even know if that's still good but you can mix Guinness with like
(1:50:36) a blueberry logger that's really good anyway to his to his credit is been
(1:50:44) blowing up everywhere i got to give him his props uh I'm blowing up too well nigga I'm blowing up
(1:50:51) uh sometimes in a good way sometimes in a bad way but I'm always blowing up oh
(1:50:56) Ralph Green and Andrew in this one i appreciate both of you guys having the faith in me uh to to moderate this you
(1:51:03) guys know my style um I I do a little moderating but mostly just to keep
(1:51:08) people from talking over each other if I feel there's a pertinent question that needs to be asked or followed up on I'll
(1:51:15) interject um if there's a super chat that I feel is relevant and not just a total insult
(1:51:22) although I'll read the insult sometimes too but you know what I mean that's kind of how I do it here i'm the referee
(1:51:27) basically i I feel like when people watch a debate it's not to hear the moderator it's to hear the participants
(1:51:34) uh in the debate that is a good a firm believer in that and so that's always
(1:51:39) been my style it won't change and you both been on my show before so you know
(1:51:44) that you get an opening statement and you get a closing statement so whoever wants to go first with their opening
(1:51:50) statement I didn't pick uh you guys can pick amongst yourself if you'd like uh
(1:51:55) but whoever goes uh first it's opposite uh the other person gets the last word
(1:52:01) uh so yeah I'm I'm fine uh opening if Adam prefers and he'll get the last word
(1:52:07) then that's fine yeah uh but real quick just just one more thing i know that
(1:52:12) there's a way to zoom in on one screen you know what I mean um so there's three
(1:52:18) screens from my end how would I how would I just set up the one screen which is what you're looking at okay so just
(1:52:24) change it go to the three dots and you go to change layout and then and then go to spotlight
(1:52:30) ah yeah there we go perfect this debate has been years in the making actually
(1:52:36) Ethan tried to set this up a long time ago it's good to finally do it i've done many debates Blood Sports on the Kill
(1:52:42) Stream also huge shout out to Andrew he's had me on Crucible many times back when it was just getting started with
(1:52:48) 10,000 subs I was coming on there and been been on there many times including just a few months ago so look forward to
(1:52:54) Yeah always uh always happy to host debates uh always happy to participate in them uh with that guys um why why
(1:53:02) don't I go ahead and let me introduce the topic first i guess I should uh is
(1:53:07) Christianity a problem or is it the solution is the official topic now I
(1:53:13) could go anywhere you know how these things go uh but that's the official topic uh and I'll let you go yeah but
(1:53:19) okay so the thing is with a black and tan a black and tan is oftentimes going to be more of like a logger mixed with
(1:53:27) uh the the Guinness or it's going to be like a logger or some other kind of like normal beer if you want a cider mix with
(1:53:33) Guinness though it's a snake blight or a black velvetine I think but all bars do different
(1:53:39) things can I please say why I don't like them i don't like Ethan Ralph because I think he's a moron i don't like Andrew
(1:53:45) Wilson because I think that he has done some really really really underhanded things but I'm open to be proven wrong
(1:53:52) or at least to be shown that maybe he's uh I don't know
(1:53:58) like I can be swayed by people who I think are intelligent and are at least
(1:54:03) like being true to themselves in some way shape or form but I don't like some of the underhanded things Andrew Wilson
(1:54:09) has done but I mean can't we say that of everyone on the internet so so um so that's why I don't like him i do like
(1:54:15) Adam Green i have no issue with Adam Green at all and and I'm just watching this because I want to see his ideas
(1:54:20) challenged and I want to see how he re how he uh reacts to it go ahead and start Mr wilson so Adam
(1:54:28) Green has an incoherent and absurd worldview in it he defines that the very
(1:54:34) society of which all of the ethics he enjoys comes from is a society he wants to obliterate does Adam for instance
(1:54:41) practice polygamy no can he give an account of why no the truth is is that
(1:54:48) the Christian ethic is so embedded in his brain that he knows right from wrong
(1:54:53) just based on the seepings of the society around him informing him through their religious beliefs what he should
(1:54:59) and shouldn't do adam can't tell anybody what's right or wrong or in between without constantly reverting back to my
(1:55:05) worldview which is actually what informs his he's a puppet of Christian ethics
(1:55:11) that guide his entire life in worldview even as he rejects them and wants to essentially destroy Christianity
(1:55:18) atheism is an abysmal failure and the secular state is an even bigger failure
(1:55:24) they are so bad they can't even reproduce their own populations opting instead to coup how big is the divide
(1:55:31) you hang on we're interrupting Andrew Wilson's uh opening statement in which he's already you know coming out the
(1:55:37) gate um someone asked about the shaw I was making earlier i'm working on a black and white shaw it's got a spiral
(1:55:42) design in the center and then I'm kind of building out from there and I don't know what I'm going to do after I get
(1:55:48) done these sections where I'm building out like these black and white chevrons but I'm not there yet so I'll figure it
(1:55:53) out but that is uh what I'm working on for people who want to see it okay back to this ask well according to Pew's data
(1:55:59) the average Mormon can expect to have 3.4 babies in his or her lifetime jews Catholics most flavors of Protestantism
(1:56:06) have fertility rates ranging from two to 2.5 at the low end of the baby making spectrum and then you've got atheists
(1:56:12) with 1.6 kids and then you have Adam's worldview the agnostics Adam who average only 1.3 adam has two kids imagine so
(1:56:20) dogmatically embracing evolution whose primary directive is to multiply your genes or be selected out of the gene
(1:56:26) pool and then reject the pinnacle of evolution which is religion the thing which gives the purpose to
(1:56:33) higher life forms to reproduce and the one thing secularists can't offer to fucking anybody the greatest irony to me
(1:56:41) is that as the reproduction crisis reaches critical levels and the secular nations disappear Japan South Korea
(1:56:47) whose majorities have no religion less than 20% in South Korea identify as being Christian for instance is it any
(1:56:54) wonder that they are at 0.81% less than one birth per woman
(1:57:00) let's ask Adam to give them a reason to multiply he can't they won't and an
(1:57:06) entire civilization will collapse because secularism is a death cult and a genetic Okay can I ask kind of a dumb
(1:57:12) question look at how pretty this Kool-Aid beer is by the way doesn't that look like Kool-Aid does it taste like Kool-Aid hang
(1:57:22) on oh holy shit this tastes like red Kool-Aid it
(1:57:29) tastes exactly like red Kool-Aid magnify Brewing we salute you a
(1:57:35) Kool-Aid beer that has alcohol in it 6% alcohol and it tastes like a
(1:57:43) Kool-Aid come on what a beer to discover at the beginning of summer come
(1:57:50) on okay so so can I ask a dumb question
(1:57:55) why why do we want more children to be born like
(1:58:02) why don't we have enough people in the world like don't we have like maybe too many
(1:58:09) people in the world why don't we want to like reduce I mean I I guess I just I've never understood this this argument and
(1:58:16) I'm sure it's probably a very simple answer and I'm sure probably it's just something I haven't thought about but like I don't understand the virtue of
(1:58:23) having kids just for the sake of having kids i don't understand why it's bad
(1:58:28) that the population on Earth might go down but I don't know i don't know why i
(1:58:35) don't know why we need to replace ourselves like what why like there are a
(1:58:41) lot of people in the world maybe maybe not replacing ourselves and the population getting smaller might be the
(1:58:48) answer to some problems i don't know there's currently 8 billion people in the world like that's a lot of
(1:58:54) fucking people do we really need to keep increasing the population on Earth
(1:59:01) but like why listen constraints breed innovation so why would But why do we
(1:59:09) need more people to keep system like didn't didn't Trump just fire a whole bunch of people from the government and it's still running didn't Elon Musk fire
(1:59:17) like 85% of Twitter's staff when he took it over and everything was fine
(1:59:29) death sentence from the AP in 2022 some 22% of voters claimed no religious
(1:59:34) affiliation according to AP Vote cast an extensive survey of more than 94,000 voters nationwide they contributed to
(1:59:41) voting coalitions that gave Democrats victories in battleground states such as Pennsylvania Wisconsin Arizona they
(1:59:48) overwhelmingly support abortion and equality between the sexes the overall
(1:59:53) voting patterns of secular voters are very well known by now it is a Democratleaning cohort in every
(2:00:00) presidential election since 1980 non-religious voters have supported the Democrat party candidates over Republican party candidates and the
(2:00:06) divide is getting even worse this has been a fucking civilization collapsing disaster
(2:00:12) while Adam's worried about a book full of what he calls fairy tales and legends his entire ideology is taking a
(2:00:18) permanent genetic dirt nap globally supporting trans gays polygamy progressive equity social justice
(2:00:24) enlightenment principles and everything in between you can imagine what a disgusting worldview to promote does
(2:00:31) Adam have any answers to these problems no does Adam even think about these problems no adam's obsessed with the
(2:00:39) Jewish scop which subverted Christians and now uses them to push Jewish supremacy meanwhile most Jews are
(2:00:46) secular in Israel over threequarters of the country's Jews define themselves as secular non-traditional ultraorththodox
(2:00:53) birth rate there though interestingly enough is 6.5 whereas the nonorthodox it's less
(2:01:00) than two even with in vitro fertilization it seems that they follow Adam's ideology and not my ideology and
(2:01:08) what's his plan to convince other secularists to do the secular things he wants nothing because he has no grounded
(2:01:15) morality he basically has to say "Well I'll assert my position harder bro." It's laughable i would like for Adam to
(2:01:22) justify or give a single solution to a single American problem any would be nice he can't he has no morality he is
(2:01:29) just an assertion machine i assert this i assert that i want this i want that no
(2:01:36) justification whatsoever no actual solutions to any problems just whining
(2:01:41) about a fairy tale book what he considers a fairy tale book that's it that's that's Adam's entire stick and so
(2:01:47) I would actually like to see him uh justify any of these i mean I don't
(2:01:52) think this is a good argument to make against Adam though because like why is Adam obligated to care about things that
(2:01:57) Andrew Wilson cares about so I don't care that Adam has a
(2:02:03) very specific focus that doesn't make a difference to me thanks and with that I'll yield my time
(2:02:08) go ahead Mr green mr green
(2:02:14) how long was that do I have a certain amount of time well it's 10 I usually keep it at 10 it's a 10 minute limit uh
(2:02:20) and so you know you can go as long as you want he went less than that but it's up to you
(2:02:27) all right i'll address some of Andrew's assertions and claims and arguments uh when we get in the back and forth but I
(2:02:33) wanted to start with uh my prepared remarks
(2:02:40) did he just cut out by the way oh there you go you're back you're back go ahead go ahead no you're back you're back go
(2:02:46) ahead we've seen Andrew in a lot of debates with Only Fan Girls recently he loves to ask the question "Do you know
(2:02:51) what a hypothetical question is?" Do you and your audience know what a hypothetical question is Andrew
(2:02:59) is Is this your opening statement or are we back wait wait wait before we get into questions
(2:03:05) let's wait for that it's just It's just This is just the beginning i haven't even really started yet i'm prefacing my comments how would you feel if you
(2:03:11) skipped breakfast this morning guys hungry because I usually skip breakfast
(2:03:19) you're on mute you're on mute Andrew i did skip breakfast this morning yeah hungry cuz I almost always skip
(2:03:26) breakfast let everybody know I'm in on the inside joke okay on the inside hypothetical joke yeah just all all the
(2:03:34) orthoby [Laughter]
(2:03:39) but I do have a hypo hypothetical question okay i want you to grant my argument for the sake of argument grant
(2:03:45) that I'm right if you were convinced Christianity is a Jewish myth and a
(2:03:51) deception to theologically conquer the nations would you give it up would you speak it against it like I do or would
(2:03:57) you still advocate for the lie and promote it as the only viable solution that is
(2:04:02) actually real quick yeah yeah I'm h I'm happy to answer i just want a quick qualification i just want to know inside
(2:04:08) of the hypothetical am I assuming your view or my view meaning I was a Christian or I am a secularist
(2:04:15) you are agreeing that it's a myth and it started from Jews yeah but from the paradigm of what me as a Christian or
(2:04:21) you as a secularist it wouldn't well no it'll inform my answer to the hypothetical now I want to
(2:04:27) remind you gentlemen technically these are opening statements uh and we haven't gotten to the question part but let me
(2:04:33) just answer i will stop go ahead i want my direction of my opening statement i need
(2:04:40) to know fair enough fair enough from a secular worldview the answer is no i would not
(2:04:46) and in fact I would continue to push Christianity even if I thought it was a lie because I think results would be better however uh from a Christian
(2:04:54) perspective if I was I don't know and somehow made aware that my religion and every um you know every bit of uh what I
(2:05:03) consider the interpersonal relationship with God was somehow demonstrated to be to me to be some kind of like internal
(2:05:09) psychosis or something like this then I might have a different answer that's why I'm asking about the worldview paradigm
(2:05:15) okay so you would still promote it even if you knew it was a lie your stance is if I was a secularist yeah plato's noble
(2:05:21) lie the go see this is where Andrew Wilson uses loses me because it's
(2:05:26) like if you know Christianity isn't real then why would you promote it you can
(2:05:32) promote values you can say "Hey I think family is good i think we should have family for reason X Y B and Z." You
(2:05:39) don't actually need to be a Christian in order to promote family values or I
(2:05:45) don't know traditional gender roles or any of those things you can make secular arguments for those things but why would
(2:05:51) you continue to push something that you know is a lie william can't handle the truth we they
(2:05:58) need this lie to function so how do we know if you really believe it or not u
(2:06:03) if you're willing to still advocate for something because if you really wanted to advocate advocate for this you would
(2:06:09) not admit that you don't believe it because you thought it was the best outcome so that's number one question so just to be clear you would still argue
(2:06:18) he's cutting out a little bit with his Wi-Fi that's not me you're back you're back go ahead go ahead i think you're
(2:06:23) back i cut out too i missed a little okay are we both you're No no no
(2:06:29) promoting values is not too vague it's not there are secular reasons why the
(2:06:35) nuclear family is a good thing there are secular reasons why we should be able to say there are men and women and there
(2:06:41) are two there are secular reasons for all of this it is literally and this is where the Christians fucking lose me
(2:06:47) every single time it is literally only Christians who believe that there are only Christian arguments to be made in
(2:06:54) this regard it is literally only Christians who believe that your morality sets the standard for everyone
(2:07:02) else it is literally only Christians that believe that your ideas are the
(2:07:08) things that are required to allow people to live in a functional society when
(2:07:13) there are many societies they're not Christian societies they're perfectly fine there are many ways that people can
(2:07:19) live life and experience life on this planet without being a fucking Christian there are many different ways that
(2:07:25) people can judge here's proper behavior and here's behavior that's going to cause problems karma is a thing if you do bad
(2:07:33) things you are going to experience bad things if you do good things you're going to experience good things that's
(2:07:39) not a Christian belief it's just you it's just you bro
(2:07:47) yeah it's just you um not my Mexican internet
(2:07:52) i know we had some problems during the Ricada interview with the lag when I went to CDMX but uh but anyway no it was
(2:08:00) just a skip go ahead no no no this is where you assholes lose me every single
(2:08:06) time it is not the history of the world it is your history it is your chosen
(2:08:12) history you guys are just like leftists in this regard you think that your lived experience is all that matters you
(2:08:19) really think that the only people who have who have wisdom in this world are people who believe what you do that is a
(2:08:26) leftist belief you are fucking leftist i don't believe you i don't believe you
(2:08:31) for one red second if if you were really an atheist you wouldn't be arguing that
(2:08:37) Christian morality is the history of the world because that's a retarded position to take there were belief systems that
(2:08:43) existed before Christianity there are belief systems that have existed separate from Abrahamic religions this
(2:08:49) entire time and if you don't know that that is your ignorance and your ignorance is not our problem
(2:08:59) go ahead okay so just to be clear you would still argue a deliberate manufactured religious deception is our
(2:09:05) only option so that tells me that you weren't really thinking clearly like you've got extreme secularist inv okay
(2:09:13) yeah if I was a secularist yes because if I was a secularist I would I would reduce my worldview to nihilism there
(2:09:20) would be no purpose for me to do anything but go for whatever results that I wanted in society at that point
(2:09:25) wrong so you would still push it even if you thought it was a lie i I think it's really convenient that Andrew thinks
(2:09:30) that the only plausible possible solution for humanity happens to be his specific denomination of Christianity
(2:09:37) which is only about one in 10 Christians in the world true andrew's whole position is built on the premise that
(2:09:44) Europeans are so pathetic that we would just be helpless incompetent failures without the Hebrew Torah in the Bible
(2:09:51) you're basically arguing that we couldn't build a functional society we couldn't have any morality we couldn't
(2:09:56) pro procreate with women build families or accomplish any great things without
(2:10:01) ancient Hebrew mythologies basically we would be nothing without the Jewish Messiah and the Hebrew Torah i think
(2:10:08) it's demeaning this is the same identical rhetoric rhetoric we hear from the rabbis who say it's their mission to
(2:10:14) bring Yahweh's ethical monotheism and morals and commandments to the Gentiles and have them fear the God that chose
(2:10:21) them the same exact rhetoric they have and they also brag that Christianity and Islam trans transition Gentiles away
(2:10:28) from their religions and cultures uh and pagan quote unquote pagan idol worship towards the God of Israel and proton
(2:10:35) Noahide religions andrew shares the position of the most slavish Christian Zionists like John Haggy I and
(2:10:42) Christians I have clips of who say quote everything good we have comes from the Jews or quote we were nothing before the
(2:10:49) cross it's degrading it's insulting but the Bible does say salvation is of
(2:10:54) the Jews so I'm not surprised that that's your position andrew promotes Christianity as our only solution just
(2:11:00) like Christian Zionists all the Christian Zionists out there and just like the Jewish Zionists Ben Shapiro and
(2:11:05) Dennis Prager who also advocate for a more Christian America i think it speaks volumes that you would grant
(2:11:12) Christianity as a deception but then still argue that see this is this is one of I think the strengths of Adam's
(2:11:17) argument is like why are the Jewish people arguing in favor of Christianity
(2:11:22) because that doesn't make sense at all why are pre why are we pretending that
(2:11:29) Judaism is the same as Christianity and that all Christians should support all Jews that doesn't make sense to me at
(2:11:36) all they're two extremely different belief systems so I don't get that why
(2:11:42) are why is dispensationalism even a thing like why are we why are Christians
(2:11:50) obligated to support Israel as a as a state that doesn't make sense to me
(2:11:58) and it's like you know maybe this is like this is
(2:12:04) my lived experience whatever [Music] but I have had so many negative
(2:12:11) interactions with Jewish people for things like making jokes or like not
(2:12:19) supporting Israel's genocide in Gaza that I'm kind of like I don't really see any reason to
(2:12:26) support you like you're you're you're kind of assholes to be honest i'm not saying all Jewish people are assholes
(2:12:32) there are plenty of Jewish people who are perfectly nice human beings but I'm saying that I've had a lot of
(2:12:38) interactions with Jewish people who acted like unhinged fucking
(2:12:44) retards just like really horrible toxic people for no reason for no because you
(2:12:50) said something they didn't like or they made a you made a joke or something like that and it's kind of like
(2:12:58) I'm obligated to support you i don't think I am obligated to support you you're literally calling for me to be
(2:13:03) raped because I made a joke about soda i made a joke about Jewish soda do you
(2:13:09) know how many Jewish people for were calling for me to be deported and raped
(2:13:14) and murdered because I made a fucking joke about
(2:13:21) soda i don't think that's what God's chosen people would do that doesn't seem very like spiritual to
(2:13:30) me rottweiler thanks for the super chat one can admit that a lot of one's values
(2:13:36) come from religion by virtue of upbringing and looking/adopting an
(2:13:41) ethical standard aren't mutually exclusive that's where Christians lose people when talking about ethics i
(2:13:47) completely agree with you Rottweiler thank you
(2:13:52) a Jewish apocalyptic messianic cult that's what Christianity is a Jewish
(2:13:57) apocalyptic messianic cult is our only option and viable path forward a sect
(2:14:03) led by priests laring like Jewish wizards who believe an antichrist has to rule the world and apocalyptic wars must
(2:14:09) occur before Jesus returns you skipped a little bit all you're
(2:14:16) selling that as our one and only option i think it's it's ridiculous there you go you're back go ahead can you guys
(2:14:22) hear this yeah yeah yeah you're back you just We only missed We only missed about 4 seconds dude yeah yeah it was We
(2:14:29) didn't miss much um no i just don't want to blame on me no adam Green is not
(2:14:35) Jewish don't start rumors he is not Jewish at all in any way calm down
(2:14:41) that's the only thing um so um I'm not done go ahead you have 10 minutes i I
(2:14:48) always had that standard 10 minutes you know go ahead this view is cynical it's
(2:14:53) defeated and it's really limiting us from escaping the whole Judeo paradigm that's been the status quo for the last
(2:15:00) 1700 years we're basically saying we are dependent on the Jewish religion we need the Jews and their rejected Messiah uh
(2:15:08) it's humiliating it's embarrassing the Bible says to judge a tree by its fruits right and the Christian fruits have
(2:15:14) proven to be rotten the roots are rotten the fruits of Christianity has led to Zionism and led to disaster for the West
(2:15:22) there would be no Christian Zionism without Christianity you asked you asked uh if I could name one single American
(2:15:28) problem that would be fixed with Christianity disappearing the Christian Zionist problem would be the biggest one
(2:15:34) I would say there christianity has led hundreds of millions of Christian Zionists it's led to endless conflict
(2:15:39) between different sects of Christians between believers and non-believers and has all Hang on i got another super chat
(2:15:45) hang on hang on hang on hang on mero thank you for the super chat one of the Jews aren't God's chosen people anymore
(2:15:53) the reason why this isn't understood Hang on one of the Jews aren't God's
(2:15:58) chosen people anymore the reason why this isn't understood since they don't actually read the full Bible paul is
(2:16:05) clear on this all right thank you i appreciate it
(2:16:14) types of other detrimental effects for people in society how can Eastern Orthodoxy your sect of Christianity just
(2:16:21) one in 10 of Christians in the world how can Eastern Orthodoxy be the answer to our societal ills when it's been a
(2:16:28) thousand plus years and you can't even fix Christianity you can't even keep your own house in order why do you
(2:16:34) expect us to believe that that that Eastern Orthodoxy is the only solution to fix all of society when you can't
(2:16:40) even uh you're not even the dominant form of Christianity and keep them in order you agree most Christians are
(2:16:46) heretical and not real Christians but they're the ones that overshadowed you and they're the ones that wield the influence and have the power in
(2:16:52) advancing their agenda now let me ask a question um do you finish i just got a
(2:16:58) little bit more sure sure if you have a little bit more i I was just going to follow up on on what you were asking but
(2:17:03) go ahead if the majority of Christians are going to go to hell like you believe you're
(2:17:08) basically admitting that the Bible and Christianity is corrupted it's flawed and Jesus's mission to earth to set up
(2:17:15) his church was a failure you've got big problems when your holy book is so
(2:17:20) easily corrupted god created humans gave us a book started the church but then things are just going terribly wrong in
(2:17:26) your worldview but if we just double down and try to salvage the sinking ship that uh that's some somehow more of the
(2:17:33) problem will be the solution now I was going to ask a question uh ju just here
(2:17:39) do you believe that Protestants uh Catholics um other sects of Christianity
(2:17:45) are heretical andrew uh and do you believe those people will go to hell no
(2:17:52) the Eastern Orthodox don't make salvific claims okay all right all right now go ahead now you can address what the real
(2:17:58) version and they're not going to hell i think that's advantageous for your argument right now but I've heard seen plenty of them say that if they're not
(2:18:05) doing Okay Adam adam stop stop hang on hang on let's back up for a second okay
(2:18:11) it doesn't make a statement gentlemen one at a time one at a time yeah so so when
(2:18:17) you when you ask the question you say "Well I think that that's advantageous for your claim right now." Um and you
(2:18:23) say "Because I've heard ex people say this this is facious argumentation Adam you can't equate that's literally a
(2:18:29) facious argument to say because some people say that that means it must be your position that's absurd
(2:18:35) okay well not everybody agrees on everything you get You think that you're the only true church in the Catholic
(2:18:40) Church and Protestants are radically misled right oh are we I wanted to let you finish
(2:18:46) your opening i want to let you finish your opening before we get into the back and forth so finish your opening christianity has all proven itself to
(2:18:52) not be effective i I'm going to say this cuz I'm going to give again i like Adam Green i really do i like him a lot i
(2:18:58) like a lot of his ideas he's not utilizing the opening statement as well as he could be and I
(2:19:05) think that kind of not being focused in that regard is not is not to his benefit
(2:19:10) and I'm having trouble following kind of like the point that he's making christianity is in rapid decline
(2:19:16) among decline among Europeans in the West probably because it's so unbelievable it's so historically
(2:19:22) unreliable and it's so obviously mythological that people just don't believe it anymore and if they don't
(2:19:28) believe it they won't adhere to it it won't work and it won't be an effective solution
(2:19:34) israel and Zionism has no greater supporters than Christians america and Europe is headed towards disaster and this decline happened on the Christian
(2:19:40) watch true andrew is trying to salvage this sinking ship but it's outdated there's no baby in the bathwater and you
(2:19:46) just need to let it die and we can move on with some actual solutions and visions that aren't rooted in ancient
(2:19:52) superstitions and uh in Hebrew myths christianity has also led us to Zionism
(2:19:57) the fruits and Christian morality led to liberalism a lot of former Christians end up being the most liberal and
(2:20:03) progressive people the reason that we don't have a rightwing That's a really good
(2:20:08) point christianity basically created communism guys
(2:20:14) point Adam Green that seculars because it's so dominated by the rights they block out any non-religious right-wing
(2:20:22) just imagine how much better we could do having arguments against the radical left arguments that are based in reality
(2:20:28) not in the Bible so true christianity was hasn't just been subverted it is the
(2:20:34) subversion and you're going to argue about we can't have morals we can't have a society that's completely degrading i
(2:20:41) could show you how the God of the Bible is not moral i can show you all of the teachings that could be detrimental that
(2:20:46) have been detrimental and let's see I got another minute but what else do I have
(2:20:52) here um I'll end here oh you're also going to say "What are you going to replace it
(2:20:58) with?" That's what I always If Adam Green had better beer his opening statement probably would have been more
(2:21:03) on point hear from you guys what are you going to replace it with but you don't
(2:21:08) need to replace a lie to prove it's a lie you don't need to provide I don't need to provide you with a magical cure
(2:21:15) to acknowledge that your diagnosis and your treatment isn't working and it's not the solution it's destined to fail
(2:21:21) why would I give you why would I have to give you more myths to play the replace the old myths we would be better off
(2:21:28) just transcending past the age of superstitious mythologies deal in reality i'm not pretending I have a
(2:21:34) perfect magic he cut for a second but it's okay little
(2:21:39) solution he's back with Christianity oh I I disappeared no you're back there's a
(2:21:45) cure all answer but until we can fix the problem I don't see us moving forward
(2:21:51) for real solutions let me ask Andrew this and then he can take on whatever he wants and it'll be a free-for-all after
(2:21:58) this do you think you need Christianity or orthodoxy or anything else um
(2:22:08) as a basis of morality like does that I obviously you do kind of ask I do but
(2:22:14) but the thing is the thing is is while I believe in the foundation of Christian ethics is being superior ethics to all
(2:22:20) the ethical system my core belief is that politics are downwind of culture culture is downwind of religion that's
(2:22:27) my core belief structure here so I do think that you can have societies which are based in other ethical systems but they're going to be informed by religion
(2:22:34) not going to be performed by a lack thereof so that is uh that is my ultimate belief uh the truth is written
(2:22:40) on your heart there are people who do know and understand morals even external the Christian ethic but but they're
(2:22:46) always in line with the Christian ethic or they're immoral judeo-christianity has been the dominant
(2:22:53) force it has been the status quo so what we're seeing where we're at today is downstream from the Judeo-Christian
(2:23:01) world no it's not it's down downstream from secular ethics and so let me ask you a counter hypothetical to the one
(2:23:06) that you asked me let us assume for a moment that Adam Green had two buttons
(2:23:11) this is you in your current form okay you have two buttons button one you pushed it and everybody turned into an
(2:23:18) atheist this in no way hurt them harmed them killed them anything like this they just turned into an atheist button two
(2:23:24) everybody turned into a Christian which one would you push oh god that is a horrible fucking
(2:23:31) question i only get to choose between atheism and Christianity i need to think about that one for a second miro thank
(2:23:38) you for the $10 super chat without Christianity slavery would still exist worldwide as an institution i don't know
(2:23:43) if I agree with that instead the British led the crusade against slavery how's
(2:23:49) that for fruit of Christianity i just don't know if I agree with your premise that without Christianity it wouldn't
(2:23:55) exist i think okay maybe Christianity elicited one specific action but was it
(2:24:01) really about Christianity or was it about something else i don't know enough about the history yeah exactly slavery
(2:24:08) still fucking exists motherfucker what are you talking [Laughter]
(2:24:13) about listen though I think that I think ultimately
(2:24:19) though it would have been like maybe the Christianity elicited
(2:24:27) some action happening but that doesn't mean it wouldn't have happened otherwise if it was supposed to happen so I guess
(2:24:34) I have to respectfully disagree with your premise but I do appreciate the money thank
(2:24:42) you oh what what So okay so what what would you guys choose what would you guys choose one in
(2:24:50) the chat if you would choose to make everyone an atheist two in the chat if you would choose to make everyone a
(2:24:56) Christian because this is actually a really hard question for me i don't know because I hate atheists i think atheists
(2:25:02) are like atheists are so fucking annoying no offense to any atheists in
(2:25:08) the chat but like atheists are so fucking annoying what did I say one in
(2:25:15) the chat if you would choose everyone being an atheist two in the chat if everyone would be a
(2:25:21) Christian but Christians can also be annoying in their own
(2:25:26) way so I don't know i think I might prefer to live around a
(2:25:32) world of Christians than a world of atheists just because atheists are so
(2:25:39) annoying most of the time that I actually think they're not as good as Christians even though Christians are
(2:25:44) also annoying i don't
(2:25:51) know looks like a divided opinion in the chat too people are really all over on the issue so I guess follow your bliss
(2:25:58) yo you have to push one everybody everybody
(2:26:04) see you don't live in a perfect world though because Answer my question Adam well well this is a Answer my question
(2:26:11) Adam i answered yours answer my question which button will you push if everybody was a sincere believer I would say
(2:26:18) Christianity would be better well then that's the end of the debate that's the end of the fucking debate let me explain why fuck you even understand what you
(2:26:25) just said yeah yeah and are you going to let me but but does Andrew believe does Andrew understand that there are more
(2:26:32) beliefs in the world than just Christian and atheist because like this is one of the problems I have with Christians is
(2:26:38) that they really don't believe that there are like more belief systems in the world it's like there are beliefs
(2:26:44) that are older than Christian Bible motherfuckers there are beliefs that have been around long before your Jesus
(2:26:51) came around and allegedly said some things and allegedly died on the cross allegedly there have been there are
(2:26:56) other belief systems that are far older than like what you believe that are not atheism that are not Christianity that
(2:27:04) are something else these things are real many people in the world believe them
(2:27:13) finish answering the question the reason why is because hypothetical this hypothetical is completely unrealistic
(2:27:20) because you can't force all people to sincerely believe in something so if you pushed a button and that became the
(2:27:26) dominant force and it was a handmaid's tail and it was uh consolidated power
(2:27:32) centralized power and total uh Judeo-Christian Zionist tyranny they're going to persecute the other people and
(2:27:38) I I would rather live in an all atheist world in reality back up the world where
(2:27:44) everybody believes let's examine this oh god I would sooner shoot myself in the
(2:27:49) foot than live in an all atheist world that would be like my very definition of
(2:27:57) hell carlin do you know Catholics actually have a job bro I was raised in a Catholic family okay i come from the f
(2:28:06) my family were French Canadians on one side and Irish Catholics on the other
(2:28:12) side i was ra I was I was one of the few black sheep in my family that was not
(2:28:17) baptized because my father was an atheist and my mother was really an agnostic but both of them went to Catholic school growing up and that's
(2:28:24) what made them an atheist and agnostic but the rest of my entire family was Catholic i've been to Catholic church
(2:28:29) multiple times i have never been smited i know about the Catholics
(2:28:36) man the problem with Christianity is there are people involved yeah that's also the problem with atheism by the way
(2:28:46) unrealistic let's Yeah let us examine this and see if this is actually true
(2:28:51) your logic here so let's begin with the fact that yes all of the people you push button one on are going to be true
(2:28:58) believers uh zealots maybe even right in the fact that they follow those Christian eth all right I need to go to
(2:29:04) the little socialist room i'll be right back i'm going to play the debate let me know if I miss anything that when I'm gone i'll be right back ics so rigidly
(2:29:12) but in two they're truly going to be atheists they follow no form of religious ethical systems whatsoever
(2:29:20) right both in both cases they're totally devout which button do you push Adam
(2:29:25) this is again another stupid question answer the question just because you don't have Christian doesn't mean that
(2:29:31) the other side has not interested in your stupid paddle answer my question
(2:29:37) you can have an ethical system without being Christianity so this is another loaded do you know what a hypothetical
(2:29:42) is i missed where the the front end of it it cut out but do you know what a
(2:29:47) hypothetical is what's a hypothetical it's a question you shouldn't answer uh
(2:29:52) but hypotheticals that are not based in reality and they're completely unrealistic that's right if they're not
(2:29:58) based in reality and they're completely unrealistic they're designed specifically to test your logic now answer my question no
(2:30:05) what answer my question didn't I just answer it no I just
(2:30:11) reframed it differently to make sure that we could test your logic they are devout button one the Christians do
(2:30:17) become all devout Christians button two they become devout atheists meaning they never refer at all to any religious uh
(2:30:24) um you know dogma of any kind for any type of ethical system which button would you push i I think that the
(2:30:31) secular ethic Hang on I'm back suzanne said a super chat the problem with Christianity is
(2:30:38) there are people involved yes Suzanne that is
(2:30:45) true okay were my parents Zionists um I never heard my parents talk about Israel
(2:30:52) in any way so I don't actually think that they cared
(2:30:58) would be better than the biblical ethics so I'd take the atheist in that question okay so you change your answer with your
(2:31:04) hypothetical you can insert any other uh monotheistic religion and it would be
(2:31:10) the same thing if everybody believed it it would the right one so you So then the
(2:31:17) question is so then the question is if all the answer gentlemen
(2:31:24) one one at a time Wilson go ahead and then let me let me finish my inquiry and
(2:31:30) you can ask me some questions afterwards so the the first part of the inquiry here as I'm testing your logic so all of
(2:31:36) them have now pushed the button and they're all atheists can you explain to me what society looks like under atheist
(2:31:43) ethics again I think this is like I do not like
(2:31:48) this debate tactic because there are a lot of belief systems in the world they're not Christian or atheist
(2:31:56) yeah it would look a lot like atheist secular societies that aren't Christian today which have which have less
(2:32:03) degeneracy which have less crime which have less issues other places around the world that don't and they don't
(2:32:08) reproduce right so the reproduction thing didn't I address that in the beginning you really think the Bible you
(2:32:14) won't sleep with women and have kids yeah well that's what the numbers show adam do you have a reputation without the magical Jews and the magical
(2:32:20) prophecies you wouldn't be with women you'd just be a bunch of evil evil guys is your your worldview reduces to
(2:32:25) nihilism tell me how you can convince somebody who tells you nihilist you say that without
(2:32:31) Christianity if Adam Green's world view reduced to nihilism he wouldn't have two kids
(2:32:39) mhm that there's nothing to live for you're the nihilist i don't I don't look at the world that way at all okay fine
(2:32:45) fine Adam then let's test and see you have nothing to test and see if this is true from Adam Green's perspective he
(2:32:52) cut out all get back no I'm back no he's back he's back go ahead okay so let us test this out from Adam Green's
(2:32:58) perspective and see if this is the case uh go ahead your your son daughter whatever been reproducing throughout
(2:33:04) time you You need Jewish lies in order to
(2:33:10) answer my question adam you're offiscating again there's no there's no society I'm aware of which has been
(2:33:16) secular that has successfully reproduced ever in history ever come on please how long have humans been reproducing are
(2:33:22) you going to name one Adam name one dude is Andrew Wilson making the argument that human beings are going to stop
(2:33:29) having sex that just seems a little
(2:33:35) unrealistic to me i don't think that's going to happen
(2:33:41) to to say that waiting for you to name one you're just off hold on let him answer andrew go ahead because of the
(2:33:48) Bible without the Bible it's instinctual in us to want to have b have sex and have babies no having the Bible is
(2:33:56) absurd correct that's not correct adam that's not correct so let me correct you because obviously you don't understand
(2:34:01) it is instinctual in you to have sex that's true that is the mechanism which
(2:34:06) leads and finish inside and no no here's the thing no no Adam here's the thing
(2:34:13) stop talking so I can make my pull out adam stop talking so I can make my point
(2:34:19) one at a time so if so if a dude can finish inside of a woman who's on birth control does that lead to reproduction
(2:34:24) or not who's saying anyone's on birth control obviously not so it wouldn't
(2:34:30) really matter even if the instinct was to bust inside of the woman if they're on birth control it's still a non-reproductive act so even if Stop
(2:34:37) talking at him see this is why I don't like Andrew Wilson this right here he's not making arguments that like I don't
(2:34:45) think these are good arguments i'm sorry Rottweiler this debate is just as
(2:34:50) dumb as the atheist versus Christian debates of 15 years ago andrew's argument is a false dichconomy or he's
(2:34:56) being disingened but see this is the pro this is the problem see this is why I needed to do this because I really liked
(2:35:03) watching Andrew Wilson just mop the floor with the midw with the midwip moron like he was so good in that debate
(2:35:10) and I would welcome watching uh Andrew did I say Adam i meant Andrew obviously um I would welcome Andrew debating the
(2:35:18) midwipit moron and any of the other woke right assholes at any time but he's not actually speaking to Adam
(2:35:26) Green's points and he's not speaking to the core of Adam Green's argument and
(2:35:31) it's like I guess maybe we'll see where this goes i just expected better i expected
(2:35:38) better i want to I want to actually see I want to actually see Adam Green challenged on his argument in a way that
(2:35:45) he has to like defend his position and right now Andrew is taking him
(2:35:51) completely off track because this isn't even the argument that that Adam Green
(2:35:57) makes what percent of secular women honor on birth control are having abortions i think more than you guys
(2:36:03) think but you guys you guys because you're in a little echo chamber you spin each other up and it's like you guys
(2:36:09) think that every woman is on birth control not every woman is on birth control you guys think that every woman
(2:36:14) has abortions not every woman has abortions that's just
(2:36:20) false but I appreciate the money thank you
(2:36:25) let me finish my point so even if it were true that you had some type of um
(2:36:31) you know grounded evolutionary stem to bust a nut in a chick which I'm not even disputing it wouldn't matter if she's on
(2:36:38) birth control it's a non-reproductive act and what's happened due to hypergamy and due to the secular ethic of of
(2:36:45) sexual degeneracy well technically birth control can fail but I suppose that's not really the point of this what has
(2:36:52) happened is that women are having the sexual acts without the reproduction most pointedly in secular societies
(2:36:58) Japan is not reproducing adam South Korea is not stop let me finish and then you can respond the South Korea is not
(2:37:05) reproducing none of the secular nations are reproducing and only the religious people in those secular nations are
(2:37:11) reproducing at a sustainable rate look it up yourself refute it Adam and the reason for that is because the nihilism
(2:37:18) takes hold and the reason it does is you cannot convince another secularist why it is that they should value offspring
(2:37:25) go ahead and try go ahead jesus in the Bible to know why I value my offspring andrew you think
(2:37:32) why should a secularist who doesn't value their offspring first off Adam if you want to go down
(2:37:40) this right like I mean um yeah this is this is this is really bad uh every
(2:37:47) society throughout history that wasn't Christian they all reproduced and survived every species throughout time
(2:37:53) unless they had some catastrophe and went went extinct or didn't adapt they
(2:37:58) they survived to say that No they didn't
(2:38:04) what are you s What are you what are you talking about this is what I say when Andrew Wilson
(2:38:10) just uses debate tactics where Adam Green is trying to make a point and Andrew Wilson just busts in with
(2:38:17) no and it's like no what
(2:38:22) Andrew no and maybe present some evidence or a counterargument but you're
(2:38:27) just saying no like just saying no is something that I
(2:38:33) would do on Twitter if I want to annoy someone where someone might someone writes this big long tweet in my replies
(2:38:39) and I just respond to them saying no it's like I know what I'm doing i know I'm going to annoy that person because
(2:38:45) they put so much energy into their response and I'm just like no that's exactly what Andrew Wilson
(2:38:51) just did magic rituals in order to have families and reproduce we could have a
(2:38:56) culture that advocated and promoted and incentivized people to have families and
(2:39:02) also uh as Christianity has been in decline secularism has been growing
(2:39:07) there's other factors that can have been contributing to smaller families and less children it's not just because they
(2:39:14) don't believe in Jesus anymore that we're not having the big families that we used to in the past and also the
(2:39:21) whole respond wait Andrew let him hold on let him respond go ahead why is
(2:39:27) having your premise why is having more people better the only way it's
(2:39:32) important to have super huge families is if you're getting demographically replaced in countries largely because of
(2:39:38) Christian ethics and having open borders and all that so true what's so good about having 10 kids instead of three
(2:39:44) kids why is that so so let us untangle this complete mess of sophistry because you don't know what you're talking about
(2:39:50) first of all when you say species have successfully reproduced species don't have birth control other than human
(2:39:56) beings Adam we're the ones with the birth control Adam rabbits don't have fucking birth control Adam that's why
(2:40:02) they're able to successfully reproduce when it comes to I'd rather stop Adam it's my turn when it comes to the fact
(2:40:09) when it comes to the fact on the other hand of human beings we are a higher intelligence if you can have all the fun
(2:40:15) of sex with none of the responsibilities from a secular perspective how can you convince a man that wants to do that or
(2:40:21) a woman who wants to do that that they should do the opposite and have offspring you can't do it you can't make an argument for why they should you
(2:40:28) can't do it adam go ahead number one number one you act
(2:40:35) like uh birth control actually changes this if somebody uh wants to have an abortion if they want to have birth
(2:40:40) control I don't know why you want to impose on them having to bring somebody in the world for one also it's
(2:40:47) instinctual for us who want to advance our progeny to pass on our genetics that's like the whole purpose of of is
(2:40:55) to reproduce we don't need the Bible in order to reproduce
(2:41:00) what does this have to do with any of the things that Adam Green actually talks about this is what this is we're coming
(2:41:07) around see I liked Andrew Wilson when he was debating the feminist that I didn't like and now he's debating Adam Green
(2:41:13) who I do like and I do understand Adam's arguments and I'm like
(2:41:18) Andrew Wilson isn't even talking about his arguments so maybe it'll get better i don't know but you act like everybody's on birth control and nobody
(2:41:25) wants to have kids exactly everybody regardless of the Bible without the Bible has the desire has the instinctual
(2:41:32) urge to reproduce i think you're No no no wrong i do not have the urge to reproduce i don't want kids i don't want
(2:41:38) to be around kids i don't want I don't want kids anywhere near me please keep your kids away from me i'm sure that
(2:41:44) most people do want to reproduce and he's speaking in generalities i just want it to be clear that I really do not
(2:41:52) want to reproduce i'm good i don't want kids i like my money and I like my
(2:41:57) freedom and not everyone wants to have kids and that's okay i would be a horrible parent i would be horrible i
(2:42:03) would raise a narcissist of a kid because I wouldn't I don't want to be a mother i just I don't and so no no Adam
(2:42:11) no not everyone wants to reproduce no
(2:42:16) let me ask you this uh Andrew let us let us wait are you anti birth control
(2:42:26) Andrew of any sort condoms uh abortion pill yeah and I can
(2:42:35) give you great great reasoning i can give you great reasoning that's even a non-religious reason why unplanned okay
(2:42:41) okay so let him talk let him talk i ask you a question great for society that's fine that's that's that's that you know
(2:42:47) that's fine Adam uh as secularists go extinct by your own birth numbers i guess that me and my stupid idea of you
(2:42:54) know actually reproducing and the Christian idea of reproducing the meek truly shall inherit the earth and so
(2:42:59) that would be prophecy being fulfilled wouldn't it Adam but now back to this let me let me get into this because
(2:43:05) again you're under some really bad presuppositions here that make absolutely no sense adam let's start with this idea
(2:43:12) when it comes to religion you don't believe in any religion you think all of
(2:43:17) them are fairy tales not just Christianity not just Judaism you think that Islam's a fairy tale you think that
(2:43:22) the gods of Rome are a fairy tale you think all of them are fairy tales right
(2:43:28) yes all of them okay then you can't point to those societies and say "Well they successfully reproduced and say
(2:43:35) that that had something to do with secularism they were all religious you don't believe in any of their religions
(2:43:41) not just Christianity." That's one so hang on hang on i'm going to give you
(2:43:46) two points you can respond to both then when it comes to point two uh you still
(2:43:51) have not answered how you would be able to successfully push women and men who
(2:43:56) were secularists into reproduction if they did not want to reproduce absent some type of religious ethical system i
(2:44:02) still want to actually hear the answer to that now I want to ask you a question though would you be in favor of a a
(2:44:08) legal code barring birth control of any
(2:44:13) sort yeah here's the thing the truth of the matter is is that the reason you
(2:44:19) have promiscuity and degeneracy on the Hang on we got a super chat from Renon thanks Renon so I understand why people
(2:44:25) would think we have too big a population as is we kind of do but we need to have a replacement for the elderly aging out
(2:44:32) japan is going but why why do we need to replace all the people who are
(2:44:37) dying if if the And honestly I'm actually asking for an answer because I feel like people just repeat this over
(2:44:44) and over again we need to replace we need to replace we need to replace we need to replace we need to
(2:44:49) replace why there are so many fucking stupid
(2:44:55) people in the world do you want to replace all the stupid people in the world cuz I don't
(2:45:02) want to replace all the stupid people in the world cuz I think we're very literally turning into
(2:45:08) idiocracy as we speak why do we need to replace people who are
(2:45:15) dying like okay yeah it's sad they're dying fine but
(2:45:21) like what is the virtue of having more why do we need to have
(2:45:28) more appreciate the money Ryan thank you swing and you have since the late
(2:45:35) 70s during the feminist revolution is due to the fact that people can have this type of promiscuous se sex absent
(2:45:40) all consequence but assume for a second you had a society where sexual intercourse led to a consequence sexual
(2:45:47) ethics would come back and force by necessity by necessity it's actually way better in societies where they outlaw
(2:45:54) these types of things because that assists with the sexual ethics of society now Adam who apparently and I
(2:46:00) didn't know this is proabortion which is fucking insane to me i'm not just You just said that I'm imposing
(2:46:07) my will by saying you can't abort your kid Adam no no I'm saying you think it's going to have a better society to have a
(2:46:13) bunch of unplanned kids by by uh irresponsible no there's going to be less there's going to be less kids right
(2:46:18) now single motherhood is at its highest rate ever Adam single motherhood right now is at its highest rate it's ever
(2:46:25) been Adam how can you then say that pre-birth control that when there was
(2:46:30) less single mothers and single parents that somehow that meant that there was le or more unplanned kids that's an
(2:46:37) insane take can you reconcile that for me you you said
(2:46:43) that secular people are going extinct right christianity no answer my question
(2:46:48) don't I will a bunch of points i'm going to start with the first one all the other shit go okay so you say that we're
(2:46:56) going extinct christianity is going extinct it's in rapid decline and it's growing among uh non-white nations only
(2:47:04) so that's why you're so desperate to have to have more babies because you're losing so many people because the religion is so unbelievable well let me
(2:47:11) address that point first no wait you gave two points for him to address okay that's fair so you say that
(2:47:19) other nations so like the Norse Norse pagans Norse Vikings they weren't they weren't having babies because it's the
(2:47:25) instinct and a natural uh it's a natural thing that that organisms want to do
(2:47:30) it's because Thor in some book said it to have kids or something that's not what is is uh motivating people that's a
(2:47:37) straw man that's a total straw man so let me let me go so let me let me No I'll I'll clarify the argument so that
(2:47:43) you can't straw man it so my argument is this yes I agree with you there's a natural inclination of human beings to
(2:47:49) have sexual intercourse with each other which leads to reproduction however with the invent of birth control pro and um
(2:47:57) abortion condoms uh female birth control male birth control in Europe all these
(2:48:02) different things that reproduction a that reproductive action no longer leads to offspring like it used to so yes I
(2:48:09) can grant you that perhaps 2,000 years ago if you were in a non-religious society you still would have been
(2:48:15) reproducing but that is not the case now it's not going to be the case now secularists have no motivation
(2:48:20) whatsoever absent some type of religiosity to move towards reproduction
(2:48:26) if they do then please answer my question and explain how you would tell a secularist that they should be
(2:48:32) reproducing go ahead you don't have to tell them that they should be producing it's inherent in all of us it's a
(2:48:39) natural instinct to want to reproduce having sex in Let me answer the question let me answer the question this is why
(2:48:45) people that are even non-religious will be devastated if they can't have children they'll bend over backwards
(2:48:51) they'll spend a hundred,000 i will not be devastated if I can't have children
(2:48:56) in fact I think it would be ideal if I can't have children i'm still fertile and I don't want to get pregnant and I
(2:49:04) don't want to have kids so I would in fact not be devastated at all and dollars to have in vitro fertilization
(2:49:10) or go and have their uh their hormones fixed or whatever so they can have kids because they're so desperate to have
(2:49:16) children without Okay so first of all people do this the idea that we wouldn't be
(2:49:22) fucking we wouldn't answer children without Jesus definitely still be fuckable adam you still have an answer
(2:49:28) to what I actually said you're just offiscating again so let me repeat what I just said so one you can't who you
(2:49:35) think the very best argument to have kids is I won't have anyone to take care of me when I get old
(2:49:42) i don't think that's a good argument to have kids i have to have kids and give up year decades of my life literally
(2:49:51) decades of my life in order to maybe have someone that's going to take care
(2:49:57) of me when I get old because it's not like kids have an obligation to take care of you when when you get old
(2:50:02) they'll probably just send me to the old folks home i'll be on like Medicaid just like my grandma was by the way my
(2:50:08) grandmother I have I have one grandmother that had seven kids i had another grandmother
(2:50:15) that had four kids neither of my grandmothers were living in the home of their kids when
(2:50:21) they died both of my grandmothers were living in old folks homes and they had
(2:50:27) plenty of fucking kids to take care of them and they didn't they still went to the old folks home and it was not that
(2:50:34) it was not that the family didn't like them it was not the family didn't want to take care of them but both of my
(2:50:39) grandmothers had issues that needed to be addressed in another old folks home one of them had diabetes and lost her
(2:50:45) leg the other one had a stroke so it's like this argument that like there'll be no one to take care of me of course
(2:50:50) there will be there'll be an old folks home i'll go fucking wither away with my knitting in my old folks
(2:50:56) home hopefully my husband hangs around for a minute and maybe we can take care of each other i don't
(2:51:01) know but not every kid takes care of their
(2:51:07) parents and and it's honestly not even optimal for every kid to take care of their
(2:51:13) parents can't point to outliers and say "Oh there's some secularists who get really upset that they can't have kids."
(2:51:18) Yes I'm sure that there are there's maternal instinct but for men for men
(2:51:24) especially they really like to fuck lots and lots and lots of women and not have
(2:51:30) kids they really like that Adam are you Am I Am I wrong or am I right because I
(2:51:35) think I'm right and here's what happens because you have birth control the side effect is you don't have these children
(2:51:42) Adam you don't have them and And what the thing is you can't dispute this
(2:51:47) you're the reason that men move towards procreation is because they like to fuck
(2:51:52) women women have a maternal instinct they want to have kids that's all true however you can pass on their jeans you
(2:52:00) can have children and pass on their jeans yes but but the drive to pass on your genes is not necessarily the drive
(2:52:05) to have a kid the drive is for you to in pass on your jeans without having a kid adam let me explain you're Because the
(2:52:13) act of sex is what passes the genes up bro this guy's internet fucking sucks
(2:52:21) it looks to me like it's going good all right right Adam for a couple seconds
(2:52:26) here and there adam stop i'm going to explain i'm going to explain cuz you don't know i do want
(2:52:33) to say more time to talk Andrew than Adam i don't know he just asked me a question it's fair you're right you're
(2:52:39) right i just let me answer i just want to point out I just want to point that out go ahead let me answer the question
(2:52:45) pagan does a rabbit Does the rabbit Adam does a rabbit know that when it has
(2:52:51) sex with another rabbit's gonna have kids uh yeah I think so probably no it
(2:52:56) doesn't it doesn't it doesn't know that other people do it yeah no no the rabbit doesn't know that it's going to have
(2:53:01) kids when it has sex it doesn't know that there's This is the problem andrew has now completely this
(2:53:09) is why I don't like Andrew Wilson and his debate tactics because it's like this is not a debate about the issues
(2:53:14) this is not a debate about what Adam Green actually believes andrew Wilson has now taken this debate and they've
(2:53:20) gone down a back fucking road and they're meandering through the woods and
(2:53:25) this is not relevant to what Adam Green actually believes at all and what I wanted to see when I watched this was
(2:53:31) Andrew Wilson challenging Adam Green on what Adam Green actually fucking believes not some debate tactics
(2:53:37) bullshit where he's meandering down a back road because he found like a fucking thread he could pull off of Adam
(2:53:44) Green's sweater yeah they're already off the cliff exactly they're already off the
(2:53:50) fucking cliff adam's also ignoring the factor of rising percentage of porn addiction well
(2:53:57) what like what but what does this have to do with anything they literally introduced
(2:54:02) electronics to a tribal society and within a month men became addicted to porn i mean that sounds like a flaw of
(2:54:10) men to me can't you guys control yourself like you know it's not You don't have to watch porn like
(2:54:17) why is that everyone else's problem
(2:54:23) stop being instinctual so they may not know no they don't know stop let me finish adam let me finish let me answer
(2:54:30) the question Adam you already answered the question no great so if the answer
(2:54:35) is no then why is it that you make the assumption i I don't know that it's no
(2:54:40) okay but it's no hang on rottweiler says "Counter Korea banned porn and the birth rates haven't Oh is that right korea
(2:54:48) banned porn and the birth rates haven't gone up."
(2:54:53) Fascinating just discovered you this morning would you mind giving me a brief description of your personal and political worldview so I understand all
(2:54:59) right um well I'm an anti-communist at heart well at the core of what I am I
(2:55:04) cover the far left now this is this is Friday and we're drinking so this is a
(2:55:10) special Friday stream where we drink and we watch kind of fun content on the internet on most days you will find me
(2:55:16) covering the radical revolutionary far left because I was a former leftist that was on the left for like 20 years and
(2:55:22) then I left the left and then I started researching the left and covering the left and and I show more leftist content
(2:55:28) than anyone does on the internet so this is this stream is not a good representation of my normal content this
(2:55:33) is just a fun stream for a Friday because we're drinking okay so my personal political worldview is I'm
(2:55:39) pretty fucking fascist at this point i'm pretty right-wing i'm I'm extremely
(2:55:44) right-wing um I want to ban a bunch of stuff i want to ban like queer theory i want to ban queer theory from being
(2:55:50) published i want to burn all queer theory books i think it's really the only way we're going to survive but ultimately at the core of what I do is
(2:55:56) just mostly like anti-radical leftism but I'm not talking about the clickbait bullshit that most interview like like
(2:56:02) conservative influencers share i'm talking about the real far left not the madeup nonsense so welcome to the
(2:56:07) channel thank you for the $10 we're glad you're here and um come to Socialism Saturday tomorrow
(2:56:14) we do socialism Saturday on Saturdays at 6 p.m and you'll be able to see real radical revolutionary socialists and
(2:56:20) you'll hear some of the craziest shit you've ever heard in your life and uh yeah counter Korea isn't religious okay
(2:56:28) you guys can have your debate about South Korea in the chat
(2:56:36) oh so the thing is is no the Adam the rabbit doesn't know that it's going to have kids by having sex its instinct is
(2:56:42) to have sex that's what passes on the reproductive genetic material for the child you're proving my point it doesn't
(2:56:49) need the Bible do rabbits have the Bible do they need Rabbits don't have birth control adam is right they don't have
(2:56:55) birth control what not everybody's on birth control true i I would No Adam
(2:57:00) secularists are on birth control yes hold on hold on hold on that don't dictate secularism you could have
(2:57:06) cultures that aren't religious that that that uh frown upon
(2:57:13) uh extrammarital sex you could have religious uh cultures that aren't religious that are opposed to birth
(2:57:18) control and advocate for having lots of children none of this all of this can exist without Christianity oh that's
(2:57:25) true you can logically you just admitted I'm right then that's No I didn't admit you're right i admitted that it could be
(2:57:31) true i just want to say that I really appreciate the people debating in the chat sending me money when I don't
(2:57:36) really care about your debate but I'm going to take your money don't get it twisted counter counter irrelevant christianity and porn consumption aren't
(2:57:43) mutually exclusive it presupposes no Christian ever consumes porn and we know
(2:57:49) Christians consume
(2:57:55) porn you don't have to stop sending me money Rottweiler i appreciate you and your money i appreciate you first of
(2:58:02) course but I also appreciate when you send me super chats [Laughter]
(2:58:08) true logically that you could have an entire group of secularists who were promoting that you have many many many
(2:58:15) more children i could completely agree that could be true however it's not true what's actually happening instead is
(2:58:21) they're not doing that in fact they dropped the population bomb all over the world explaining why you shouldn't have
(2:58:28) kids written by secularists promoted by secularists doing everything they can to reduce the world's population especially
(2:58:34) of religious people but secularists Adam all of these nations all of them which
(2:58:40) are secular nations that you can point to their birth rate is in massive decline while you make the case well
(2:58:46) wait a second uh uh what do you think you need some kind of religion well yeah because if you have no epistemic
(2:58:52) foundation for going ahead and having children but you can have the reproductive act without the consequence
(2:58:58) of children why wouldn't a fucking nihilist secularist do that Adam why can you give me an argument for why you or
(2:59:05) how you could convince a person to actually have children i just want to say this because um and again I'm not
(2:59:11) interceding on either side but believe in Jesus i still want to have children as many as I can but hold on i just want
(2:59:18) to say this because you know the Roman emperors the you know the Greeks before
(2:59:23) um thought that society needed a religion uh and they had to have that
(2:59:28) because they weren't smart enough basically and they needed that guidance and they needed that structure
(2:59:35) uh and so you're saying that even if you didn't believe you said this already uh
(2:59:41) Andrew and again I'm not trying to intercede but I'm just trying to elucidate um you're saying that even if
(2:59:47) you didn't believe it you think it would be better for society uh for that to be the case you asshole sent $1 on Rumble
(2:59:55) for people why is a $1 super interrupting the whole debate and that I
(3:00:01) was a secularist i didn't believe in God in any way shape or form but it was
(3:00:06) proposed to me if I had some type of empirical data that was overwhelming
(3:00:11) let's say there was a shadow council and we all came together and they were like "Listen Andrew if we promote this great
(3:00:18) lie but it's fantastic for people's mental health their reproductive rates
(3:00:24) and everything else would you do it as a secularist i don't know how I could object." And the the thing is is Adam
(3:00:31) also does i don't know how he can object as a secularist doesn't Say Hang on Adam i'm almost done i'm almost done i'm
(3:00:37) finished let me finish because I asked the question i don't know how Adam can actually object to this either if it
(3:00:43) were true him as an agnostic if he was in that shadow room and they told me
(3:00:49) you're in Grand Rapids for the LNC meeting
(3:00:56) trendelyn I want you to have a really good time at the LNC meeting i want you to tweet uh live tweet the LNC meeting
(3:01:02) so I can follow it um and let me know if there's any drama and uh you know
(3:01:08) really you're going to have a good time trying it's going to be fine congratulations on your wasted weekend
(3:01:16) that they had a stabilizing force for society even if it was a lie and it turned out that when people followed it
(3:01:22) they reproduced more their country would be stronger the nuclear family would be intact there wouldn't be faggots there
(3:01:27) wouldn't be trannies there wouldn't be abortion how could he say no
(3:01:34) go ahead Adam this attitude that like without the Bible everybody would just be evil and gay it's it's degrading and
(3:01:41) demeaning even with the Bible there's plenty of Christians that the only thing stopping them from uh having butt sex is
(3:01:48) fear of the devil basically so they the devil the devil stops them from being gay but to to go back one and I hope we
(3:01:55) can move on from the Yeah I'd like to move on from the finish your point because I got to step away and close my window because it's a torrential fucking
(3:02:02) downpour in Merida right now um so continue your point and then let's move
(3:02:08) on from this because we really spent way more time on this than I had planned but I think it's been fruitful though still
(3:02:14) maybe not fruitful in terms of uh production but anyway um go ahead that was a joke uh do you think do you think
(3:02:22) it's impossible Andrew for a secular society to outlaw birth control and
(3:02:27) advocate for having big strong families uh no well so when you're talking about
(3:02:33) what what you're remember what you're asking me you're having a purple lady drink and a fillet that sounds so
(3:02:38) amazing actually you're asking me about logical possibility wolverine is logically
(3:02:44) possible superman is logically possible these are things which are logically possible but aren't actually possible
(3:02:52) you understand the distinction that something can be logically possible without actually being a possibility
(3:02:58) you're saying it's lo it's only logically possible it's impossible for any society ever ralph didn't turn off
(3:03:05) the super chats before he left
(3:03:12) oh my god you had one job bro just turn off the super chats this isn't hard this
(3:03:17) is your one job without the Bible to advocate for having children it's impossible for any society ever without
(3:03:24) a religious frown upon birth control well Adam I can demonstrate this for you i can demonstrate this for you can you
(3:03:31) explain to me why it is adam I think I'm going all of the secular nations all of
(3:03:37) them every one of them on planet Earth not a single one that isn't is under
(3:03:43) replacement rates across the board can you give me a fucking explanation for that absent some absurdity about
(3:03:51) Christians bad can you really give me an explanation for why that is go ahead
(3:03:56) yeah I'd say it has to do with uh the way there's so many more incelss the way
(3:04:02) families have less income to have bigger families there's less of a need for bigger families because there's there's
(3:04:07) less uh uh infant mortality well Adam can you explain Can you explain then why it is your question perfectly no but
(3:04:14) it's wrong it's wrong Adam no no it's not your jousting on this Adam so why is
(3:04:21) it that is the case that it's an income issue do the poorest people have the most children adam
(3:04:27) uh because they're dumb because they're dumb okay because they're dumb
(3:04:33) it's because it's because they reject it's because they reject materialism adam
(3:04:38) Green wins again adam Green is really like dominating in this debate so far as I'm concerned to be honest with you okay
(3:04:46) I got to go to the little socialist room again i'll be right back let me know if I miss anything you just got done telling me that the reason people that
(3:04:52) secularists aren't having as You just got done saying the reason secularists aren't having as many children is
(3:04:57) because they don't have enough money and yet I just rightly pointed out that it's the people with the least amount of
(3:05:02) money who have the most children so that can't be the reason Adam that doesn't logically track you understand that
(3:05:12) no i disagree i strongly disagree so explain to me the all of your premise is based on this
(3:05:18) presupposition that more kids is better somehow uh um granting there's no like
(3:05:25) outside foreign demographic replacement you're not competing with other nations in your nation that are that are having
(3:05:31) more children you mean like withoutition why is having 10 kids
(3:05:37) better than having five kids okay so let me logical argument for that yeah so let me explain this to you if you and your
(3:05:44) wife have one child and then that child only has one child and this is the case
(3:05:50) for the entirety of your population your population is going to collapse it's going to collapse what did I miss what
(3:05:56) did I miss do I need to rewind it i'll rewind it adam asked all right well I got to
(3:06:03) rewind it then sorry sorry i got to rewind it i don't know how far I need to rewind but we're gonna rewind a little
(3:06:08) bit okay sorry and actually I have a Rumble rampant markx lives over on
(3:06:13) Rumble yeah lol yes Christians assert they hold the truth because they're Christians not atheists once Carlin
(3:06:20) crashes out of communism she gets basic okay thanks for the $5 i
(3:06:27) appreciate you okay let's see what happened you're asking me about logical possibility wolverine is logically
(3:06:34) possible superman is logically possible these are things which are logically possible but aren't actually assuming
(3:06:41) understand that something can be logically possible without actually being a possibility
(3:06:48) you're saying it's only logically possible it's impossible for any society ever without the Bible to advocate for
(3:06:54) having children no it's impossible for any society ever without a religious frown upon birth well Adam I can
(3:07:01) demonstrate less kids i can demonstrate this for you can you explain to me why
(3:07:06) it is adam I think I'm going with God all of these secular nations all of them every one of them on planet Earth not a
(3:07:14) single one that isn't is under replacement rates across the board can
(3:07:19) you give me a fucking explanation for that absent some absurdity about
(3:07:25) Christians bad can you really give me an explanation for why that is go ahead
(3:07:30) yeah I'd say it has to do with uh the way there's so many more incelss the way
(3:07:35) families have less income to have bigger families there's less of a need for bigger families because there's there's
(3:07:41) less uh uh infant mortality well Adam can you explain Can you explain then why
(3:07:47) your question perfectly but it's wrong it's wrong Adam i'm gonna No no it's not your jousting on this Adam so why is it
(3:07:55) that is the case that it's an income issue do the poorest people have the most children adam
(3:08:02) uh because they're dumb oh okay it's because they're dumb it's idiocracy it's
(3:08:08) because it's because they reject it's because they reject materialism you just got done telling me that the reason
(3:08:14) people that secularists aren't having as you just got done saying the reason secularists aren't having as many children is because they don't have
(3:08:21) enough money and yet I just rightly pointed out that it's the people with the least amount of money who have the most children so that can't be the
(3:08:28) reason Adam that doesn't logically track you understand that
(3:08:35) uh no i disagree i strongly disagree so explain to me the all of your premise is based on this presupposition yes that
(3:08:42) more kids is better somehow uh um granting Adam Green is about to win the
(3:08:48) debate right here like I don't even I don't even care what happens after this if Adam Green says "Why are more kids
(3:08:54) better?" Why does this actually need to happen then Adam Green wins the debate and I don't care anything else that
(3:09:01) Andrew Wilson has to say there's no like outside foreign demographic replacement
(3:09:06) you're not competing with other nations in your nation that are that are having more children you mean like
(3:09:14) withoutition why is having 10 kids better than having five kids exactly so let me logical argument for that yeah so
(3:09:21) let me explain this to you if you and your wife have one child and then that
(3:09:26) child only has one child and this is the case for the entirety of your population your population is going to collapse
(3:09:33) it's going to collapse let me give you an example i said above birth rate let me Yeah but we're not above birth rate
(3:09:38) adam rate above we're not above replacement rate so here's the thing your whole premise is on more my whole
(3:09:43) premise is that more is better so that you don't without the Bible we start incorporating we start implementing why won't you let me answer the question
(3:09:50) that you ask one at a time i have my two i don't know maybe I need to get started
(3:09:55) on some more% hold on i'll read this this is a super chat
(3:10:01) that factor in having large families seems in Germany and so I'll read this
(3:10:07) out um and it's from Assa i'll just say he says Sweden is 80% atheist they have
(3:10:16) the same birth rate as Christian Europeans it is economy that is the
(3:10:22) biggest factor in large i can't play that song okay
(3:10:30) so let's play that song but welfare and bringing in dragging society but wait he
(3:10:35) says it is economy that is the biggest factor in having large families that's great not in Germany yeah let's see if
(3:10:44) it's true oh okay thank you in Sweden Go ahead in Sweden 60% of the population is
(3:10:51) Christian next so you just lied you just full of That
(3:10:56) was a super chat and I'm responding to the super chat the super chatter is full of shit no it's 60% Christian you're
(3:11:03) full of shit full of shit all right fair enough now can we move on to um you know
(3:11:11) is Christianity the solution or or the problem um you know some of the bas bas
(3:11:18) over 80% of Swedes belong to the Lutheran Church of [Laughter]
(3:11:24) Sweden 80% of them belong to the Lutheran Church of Sweden i I just looked up it says 64 Well again this
(3:11:31) isn't this wasn't my statistic i didn't make this argument it says 64% of the Swedish population is Christian is what
(3:11:39) I see yeah so yeah this is this is this whole thing is completely and totally
(3:11:45) bullshit madeup nonsense so you're talking about the Bible if if you're talking about the fact that atheists are
(3:11:51) reproducing there's an atheist nation that's reproduc There's not there's no atheist nation that's reproducing is
(3:11:57) bullshit total bullshit no they they are and well there's lots
(3:12:02) of room for improvement but Andrew there's lots of room for improvement like I said just because Christianity in
(3:12:07) decline you can't attribute the declining birth rates just to that there's cost of living there's economic
(3:12:13) uncertainty there's changes in cultural norms higher education levels more women
(3:12:19) are being uh career focused i agree let's let me ask you a question can we
(3:12:24) address all of these without my Bible yeah yeah and I'll ask your question Adam first off to Andrew is Christianity
(3:12:33) in decline and if so why uh yes it is true that Protestant sex
(3:12:40) are being wildly abandoned i don't I I don't even blame people for abandoning them i think that you will see the more
(3:12:46) traditional sex increase you even do in Protestantism uh but it doesn't really matter the truth of the matter is is
(3:12:52) this it wouldn't matter if 60% of the population abandoned Christianity for
(3:12:58) secularism secularism is a reproductive dead end hence why Adam can't name a single secular nations nation anywhere
(3:13:06) which has above replacement rates not a one he can't name one because they don't exist they don't fucking exist not one
(3:13:15) and the reason they don't exist he says "Oh it's economic." Oh really it's economic then why are the poor people
(3:13:21) having kids if it's economic well I don't know they make decision it's because they're dumb
(3:13:27) okay so then you get into industrialization he says they drag down let me finish i'm addressing each one of
(3:13:34) your arguments then he says industrialization yeah that's true we've been going through industrialization for 100 years if you go back though 100
(3:13:40) years ago the birth rates were far higher what happened is feminism which is introduced about around 1860 to the
(3:13:48) United States through occultism uh you can actually see the decline from the 1800s to right now it goes in a direct
(3:13:55) trajectory now with only a little bit of pushup during the baby boom and the reason that this happened is because men
(3:14:01) hadn't seen women in uh you know uh 5 years of warfare and so they were fucking like rabbits literally and I
(3:14:07) don't blame them this was also pre-birth control moving into the 60s though and the 70s and the 80s and the 90s it has
(3:14:13) dropped like a rock and it will continue to do so obviously birth control is one of the primary factors to this the
(3:14:20) deconstruction of the nuclear family that is a feminist secular ethic saying that men and women are equal and
(3:14:27) egalitarian by the way that feminist Adam shares he believes that men and
(3:14:32) women are equal he believes in some fucking crazy bullshit about equity well
(3:14:37) you must Men and women are equal in every way oh okay okay so should the man be the head
(3:14:43) of the household i think they inevitably are for the most part yeah okay why should they be beta
(3:14:48) male yeah why should they be mhm um probably because they're the stronger
(3:14:57) the stronger sex oh cuz cuz strong
(3:15:03) uhhuh okay carlin if we don't meet reproduction rates humanity dies out along with the
(3:15:10) nation i'm not convinced that that's true for the long term i think you guys
(3:15:16) are thinking in very shortterm status and by short term I mean you're thinking in the course of your natural
(3:15:22) lives i think that there's 8 billion people in the world and that's a lot of fucking people and I don't think that
(3:15:29) humanity is going to die out anytime soon and I think that I think the idea
(3:15:34) that humanity is going to die out is not correct i could be
(3:15:40) wrong i'm just a childless woman that doesn't plan to have kids at all because I don't like them but like I mean maybe
(3:15:46) you're right but hey thanks for the money i appreciate it that's why they should be well yeah i
(3:15:53) mean if the girls could beat you up then they'd probably be running the house i don't know maybe in your household that's different with all the CrossFit
(3:15:59) going on yeah so so men should be the head of the household because they're stronger than women this would assume
(3:16:07) then that if a husband was stronger than a woman and through no fault of his own perhaps he got broken legs on the job or
(3:16:13) something like this now the woman's the head of the household Adam well some women do wear the pants in the household some
(3:16:20) maybe it's true i ought to be should men be the head of the
(3:16:25) household generally that's just the way things are constant state of fear easily do their agendas i don't think should be
(3:16:33) like the man says so so that's it a lot of time the men are wrong and maybe the the woman could be smarter than the man
(3:16:39) or be right on a certain issue so again though what about women voting adam should women be able to vote should
(3:16:46) women be able to vote uh I think if they're living in the society they should have representation
(3:16:51) of course so it's all egalit i think if I think property owners should be able to vote so in my family in my
(3:16:59) family I bought the house by myself i bought the house by myself before my
(3:17:05) husband moved in the house is mine i should be able to vote i'm just saying
(3:17:12) period isn't with you all of it and by my grace my husband gets to live in my
(3:17:17) house obviously I actually wouldn't mind if just property owners were were able to vote i actually think that's kind of
(3:17:23) like a fair thing you got skin in the game at that point and even if I didn't own my house I
(3:17:29) would still say that by the way men are equal let me ask you do you
(3:17:35) think women don't have the same rights in society as men wait do you think women should be able to vote
(3:17:43) me not only should do I think women shouldn't be able to vote I think that most men shouldn't be able to vote as
(3:17:50) well agreed nobody can vote
(3:17:56) further voting is stupid it's over it's over from the birth rate thing like because
(3:18:04) it is we've had a thorough discussion on that and it's like one little one last
(3:18:09) one last point on the birth rate okay okay okay andrew is acting please make it the last but go ahead this is the
(3:18:15) last one this is the this is the closer the the mic dropper andrew is acting like Christianity is some type of like
(3:18:21) uh fertility sex cult or something when in reality you got Unix you got celibate
(3:18:28) priests and your hero of Christianity is a virgin that never had sex and had no
(3:18:36) family it actually says he will come and turn household against household which Christianity does turn uh one's a
(3:18:43) believer one's not causes all types of conflict so this idea that we would have no kids without the Bible and it's some
(3:18:49) it it barely even says anything about having kids in the Bible it says like multiply like that one time and it's
(3:18:56) like oh what would we do without that oh perfect hey let's refute this again because this is the fourth time that
(3:19:02) Adam has made the straw man again what here's my actual position again that
(3:19:07) he's straw manned again without religiosity absent religiosity of some
(3:19:12) kind and Adam can point to no society in which the birth rate was sustainable that was not religious not fucking one
(3:19:18) and he can't point to a single society you know if that's not Stop talking Adam I just let you go and in modernity he
(3:19:26) cannot point to a single society which is non-religion or non-religious that has any sort of reproduction rate that
(3:19:32) is above replacement not fucking one he's been completely destroyed dismantled on this he's made zero
(3:19:38) arguments on it except well logically it's possible that secularist could have a nation where they promoted some kind
(3:19:45) of reproduction well maybe but they don't they don't have one and so you
(3:19:51) think again this is a stupid fucking I'm so fucking sick of this argument i am so fucking Can we actually get to something
(3:19:58) that Adam Green actually fucking believes
(3:20:04) adam is ignoring we built we live in a society built on Christian ethics i don't agree with that i dis I disavow
(3:20:11) even secular secular can make these assumptions because they grow upon a society built no I disagree with you man
(3:20:18) there are belief systems that are older than your Christian ethics but because you're a Christian you don't want to
(3:20:24) acknowledge that so again I appreciate the money thank you for the support i
(3:20:30) disagree you're allowed to believe whatever you want but I vehemently disagree with you
(3:20:36) adam is China particularly religious china is slated to lose half of its
(3:20:44) population by the end of the 21st century one child
(3:20:49) policy one child policy Adam why did they need you're going to lose it here why did they need the one why did they
(3:20:55) implement the one child policy because the population was exploding out of control too many people and they that
(3:21:02) was that was without Christianity's billions India why is
(3:21:08) there so many billions in India they're not Christian they're super religious it's religion the argument is about
(3:21:14) religion not specifically Christianity so I said absent religion you have can
(3:21:20) offer no epistemic reason why people should reproduce it reduces to cultural
(3:21:25) relativism and nihilism you straw man me again for the fifth time on top of that on on uh on top of the straw man when it
(3:21:32) came to China these are secularist policies introduced by communist secularists who told them due to these
(3:21:38) uh different propagandists like the population bomb that if they didn't reduce their population they were going
(3:21:44) to become overrun and that is not the case instead they shrunk it down so far
(3:21:49) through their genocidal homicidal baby killing practices that they're slated to lose half their population these were
(3:21:55) secular ethics these are not Christian ethics bad why is it bad for China to lose half
(3:22:01) their population though here's what happens what happens if you don't have population sustaining themselves is you
(3:22:06) end up with population collapse that's why Japan okay just for the record I'm about to pour beer number three it will
(3:22:13) be the orange creamsicle beer and I can't be held responsible for anything I say or do after this point continue is
(3:22:20) about to have to import tons of foreigners for the first time in its history take care of its elder population and the thing is is that
(3:22:26) sounds like Jewish propaganda that sounds like leftist propaganda you're saying they're right there's a
(3:22:31) policy opera by the way but go ahead there's a policy right now being argued
(3:22:37) on in inside of Japan and they opened it up for something like uh 250,000 foreign
(3:22:43) visas for the first time in their history because they can't take care of their elderly in other words if you don't have enough younger gener
(3:22:51) the southern accent is incoming y'all it's coming too bad Reagan isn't here
(3:22:56) she's not going to hear this is Reagan still here reagan you know it's not my fault that
(3:23:04) the southern bell comes out when I'm drinking it's not Oh Reagan is here excellent excellent reagan is about to
(3:23:10) stop running for the hills because the southern accent's about to come out reagan look at that look at that orange
(3:23:16) beer look at that orange cuz it's a creamsicle beer reagan hang
(3:23:23) on fuck me that is a great beer that tastes just like an orange creamsicle
(3:23:30) y'all cheers happy happy Friday to everyone congratulations for everyone that's still here i'm about to get drunk
(3:23:36) and we're going to watch the rest of this stream so I can't be held responsible for anything else I say or do on this entire live stream that's the
(3:23:44) rules i've had three beers just for you so we can enjoy all this together it It
(3:23:49) looks like a melted creamsicle because it tastes like a melted creamsicle let's see how much beer that's only 5% alcohol
(3:23:56) but it probably tastes like
(3:24:01) more anyway mount that like button y'all we're going to be here for a minute
(3:24:07) generation take care of the older generation that becomes a cyclical problem if if every single new generation is less than the older one
(3:24:14) you're always going to have far less people to take care of the older people not only that your population is going
(3:24:19) to continue to reduce until you reach collapse christianity
(3:24:28) needed to become able to reproduce intelligent babies take it to to the move on and
(3:24:35) there's super chance i wish I had a based Norse presenting dad to smoke weed and read
(3:24:41) the telmod all day and attack the winning side exactly lol unrelated adam
(3:24:48) always chokes on the WQAD there is nothing wrong with smoking weed and
(3:24:53) arguing against the Jews all day i completely affirm this strategy
(3:25:00) play to smoke weed and read the tow mood all day and attack the winning side
(3:25:06) right now lol unrelated adam always chokes on the WQ i
(3:25:13) mean I think he means white question and then he says white question wq I mean
(3:25:21) Christianity is what is anti-white true it says that that the ancestors of Europeans were Nazi idol worshippping
(3:25:29) demon worshippers that are burning in hell and that only the Jews had the right religion and we're worshiping the
(3:25:36) one true God so much it spits and is an insult to the history of our ancestor stupidest fucking thing I ever heard so
(3:25:42) let's refute this in 5 seconds no you you Adam I have a super chat question for you after that yes it's your turn
(3:25:49) it's your turn question dispute how how we ancestors in your history you re fake myths of the
(3:25:56) Jews okay so anyway so let me refute how dumb this this actual logic is this is very stupid logic adam if China somehow
(3:26:05) developed a a machine which destroyed cancer would you as a white population
(3:26:11) if you were the president of all whites would you adopt that technology
(3:26:17) would I adopt technology in China that destroyed cancer it destroyed cancer it
(3:26:25) was a machine that destroyed cancer would you adopt the technology for
(3:26:30) I mean uh I guess so i don't know this is nothing i mean it seems totally
(3:26:36) reasonable that if there's a technology which is superior to your own technology that you would adopt that technology for
(3:26:43) the advancement of whatever your ethnic cultural or racial demographic was so saying that oh well Christianity is
(3:26:50) beating up on whites because we stopped them from having fucking mass gay sex orgies in the forest and brought them
(3:26:56) and brought them okay so so my point but Adam my point is
(3:27:02) is that obviously the merits of the technology were such that they were adopted by these cultures and they
(3:27:07) definitely created sophistication in these cultures there's no two ways about it all right now now let me ask you this
(3:27:14) it's it's for Andrew and then I really want to move on from from the not that it's not been you know um interesting
(3:27:22) it's just like it's eating up the whole debate um uh Nazi Dice says this uh the
(3:27:29) Jewish god of Christianity who Andrew is cucking for only had one son and left
(3:27:36) him with a single mother with no financial support so much for God's nuclear family morality yeah we should
(3:27:44) always look through we should always look through a cultural prism of historic norms through modernity like
(3:27:50) feminists do you fucking retard fair enough all right now can we can we
(3:27:56) move on to some other I mean the birth rate I think that's a interesting discussion but you know we spent a lot
(3:28:02) of time I think we beat that one to death yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and you guys need Jesus to get a heart on and
(3:28:07) have kids you do you i'm going to be all right uh without it so uh Andrew can you
(3:28:14) demonstrate your your whole thing is we wouldn't have morals morals come from God how do you know your God is moral
(3:28:21) because the Bible says so because your church father what standards do you determine that your god is moral and how
(3:28:26) how do you know that those morals are the best why would it matter cuz it's your whole argument your
(3:28:32) whole argument it's not my whole argument so the thing is is that let me explain this to you so that you understand from
(3:28:38) a logical prison mary wasn't a single all Adam Green can make is assertions for morality i assert Adam
(3:28:45) what the fuck are you talking about you've been making assertions from morality this entire fucking time
(3:28:52) see this is why I don't like Andrew Wilson because he's not an he he is
(3:28:57) disingenuous man see I needed to watch this to remind myself that Andrew Wilson is disingenuous
(3:29:06) he is moral andrew Wilson then says "Okay but I assert XYZ is moral cancer destroying technology." You have no
(3:29:12) reputation to that we're on completely equal plane jews helped humanity you cut out
(3:29:17) the last couple words there can you say it again yeah if Adam Green says XYZ is moral and that's my assertion i just
(3:29:23) feel like that's true then all I have to do is say well then XYZ alternatives to that is moral because I feel it's true
(3:29:29) that's it that is the reality of the world we live in we have different assertions your assertions say that
(3:29:34) whatever the Bible says is good whatever God is God is moral because he said so so that's your assertion yeah so what
(3:29:42) well so what i don't believe who cares what you agree with but your what your
(3:29:48) worldview of relativism reduces to is might makes right so all we have to do is all we have to do is breed enough and
(3:29:54) you breed not enough that we have the might right that's it so from your worldview there
(3:30:00) can you even tell me why it would be immoral for Christians to enslave you can you even tell me that Adam tell me why it would be
(3:30:06) immoral it's wrong to lie and deceive and enslave why is slavery bad yeah why is
(3:30:13) somebody theologically conquering the question that's just begging the question making an innocent person bad
(3:30:19) like why are you restating my question answer you're losing when you have to make these type of Stop restating the
(3:30:25) question and answer it can you even tell me why it would be bad for Christians to enslave you can you even tell me that
(3:30:31) yeah yeah cuz I wouldn't want to be enslaved i So that's why uh I wouldn't
(3:30:37) want to because of the golden rule basically oh and who gave you the golden rule i wouldn't want to be enslaved who
(3:30:44) gave you the golden rule every culture had golden re rule oh the golden rule is otherwise known as karma
(3:30:51) motherfucker karma doesn't come from Christianity karma is a separate thing god is moral because he lets us make our
(3:30:58) own fuckups free will not slaves true i agree with that and he guarantees evil
(3:31:05) is always punished in hell i don't say hell i would say evil is always punished
(3:31:10) by karma so slight difference there adam just argued their no truth just
(3:31:17) worldview i don't agree with you that that's what Adam argued i agree with you on the first point that God allows us to
(3:31:24) have our own fuckups that's what free will is i agree with you on the point that if you commit evil you will
(3:31:31) experience ramifications for the evil i don't agree that that's hell i think that that's karma i don't agree that
(3:31:38) that's what Adam just argued but I appreciate the super chat thank you Miru thank you
(3:31:45) oh okay you think that Christianity invented so let's see so let's see hang on Adam let's see if we can test this
(3:31:51) then let's see if we can test this then Adam Green's preference is because he doesn't want to be enslaved nobody
(3:31:56) should be enslaved so then all we would need to do is find one person who wanted to be enslaved and then therefore
(3:32:02) everybody should want to be enslaved right Adam that's that's a twisted version of the gold adam answer my
(3:32:07) question some people are sadistic they like to be whipped and abused and chained i don't want that so I wouldn't want to the logical I'm going to show
(3:32:14) you the logical entailment people as they wouldn't want to be here's Adam Green's logical here's your logical
(3:32:20) entailment Adam Green doesn't want to be enslaved therefore nobody wants to be enslaved so then Adam if that is true
(3:32:27) Christians they want to be if that is true then all I need to do is find one man who wants to be enslaved and then
(3:32:32) therefore everybody should want to be enslaved right Adam yeah you Christians want to be enslaved my question I am I
(3:32:40) am answering your question by saying you're Another assertion no no i'm answer that's an answer then answer it
(3:32:46) yes or no Adam yes or no yes or no to what okay so let me restate
(3:32:52) it adam Green says "I don't want to be enslaved therefore nobody should be enslaved." So then all I need to do is
(3:32:58) find one man who says "But I do want to be enslaved and then therefore all people should be enslaved." No again
(3:33:03) like I said that's a perverted version of the golden rule okay how's it How's the contradiction Adam don't treat
(3:33:08) people as you wouldn't want to be treated show me the logical contradiction Adam oh hang on hang on breaking news i just ordered pizza and
(3:33:15) so I got to run down and make sure my outside light is on cuz my husband is out drinking with his friends i'll be right back let me know if I miss
(3:33:21) anything okay
(3:33:28) to come to them right show me the logical contradiction adam the
(3:33:34) utilitarian most people whatever causes results in the least harm adam this is
(3:33:39) so obvious oh what show me the contradiction Adam the Bible says so the Bible says it's bad so it's bad because
(3:33:45) the Jews wrote it down that's We're gonna try We're gonna try this we're gonna try this again and I'm gonna Unfortunately I can't move off of this
(3:33:52) it's my turn to do a question well no it's not because you haven't answered my question answer your question we're going to try this again we're going to
(3:33:57) try this again hold on let me answer no I'm not going to let him date adam I'm not gonna let him I'm not going to let him off okay but let's do at a time is
(3:34:05) all Yeah so let me try this let me try this again i want a yes or no this is a logical entailment if A then B if A Adam
(3:34:15) says I don't want to be enslaved therefore nobody should be enslaved that is if A then B so then if I find a
(3:34:22) person who says I do want to be enslaved then B logically would be then everybody should be enslaved yes or no adam is
(3:34:29) that logical or illogical answer yes or no you're you're framing in bad faith this question the question rule that I'm
(3:34:37) talking about you can find some some Andrew go ahead just because you
(3:34:44) can find one weird person that wants to be a slave and wants to be chained up and whipped and abused and not have any
(3:34:50) autonomy doesn't mean that most people generally don't so all of our morality comes from the consensus of the majority
(3:34:56) pretty much just like the consensus consensus of the majority says circumcision is good it's good right
(3:35:03) you're just going to keep Yes the consensus and them debating that's how the church fathers uh came to their
(3:35:09) conclusions by them disagreeing and debating about things let me make sure I think you put your authority into into I
(3:35:16) want to make sure I got this right you put your authority into guys in robes holding scepters dressed up like Jewish
(3:35:22) wizards and I like to rely on logic and arguments oh you don't like to rely on
(3:35:27) logic that's why you make the most illogical arguments I've ever heard so let's see if you like to rely on logic let's find out you think you think
(3:35:34) morality You think morality comes You think morality comes from consensus you Andrew it's my turn to ask a question no
(3:35:41) it's not it's our We're having an exchange we're having an exchange and I'm not done with the exchange get back
(3:35:46) get your earphones back on be a big boy and get back in the debate okay i'm not listening i'm not I'm not listening
(3:35:55) it's my turn my turn to ask a question we're not done with the excusing bro listen no you just took your Did Adam
(3:36:03) Green just fucking take his earphones off and was like I'm not
(3:36:11) [Laughter]
(3:36:20) listening adam [Laughter]
(3:36:29) W adam just won this entire debate
(3:36:34) your head goes out bro my question bro we're still in the
(3:36:41) exchange i'm not done with the exchange so back to the
(3:36:47) exchange you believe that morality comes from consensus that's what you just said
(3:36:52) true or false no that that's how cultures generally societal norms cultural norms the morals that people
(3:36:59) agree on that's the that is he he he cut for a sec how it actually
(3:37:12) people debating on what your Bible says that's where they derive their morals so you do the same thing i don't see how
(3:37:17) you're so back to my back to my actual question i'm gonna ask you again oh my god does Adam Green believe that
(3:37:23) morality comes from consensus or not i don't believe it comes from consensus
(3:37:28) from the way it naturally occurs in societies yes as I've explained many times already what does that mean
(3:37:34) naturally you think it comes from what you think all morality comes from God you're not answering you're asking you
(3:37:40) can do the internal critique when we're done let's finish though if you say that
(3:37:45) are you saying that morality itself comes from consensus or not
(3:37:52) social constructs okay from from a consensus usually a consensus that's
(3:37:57) usually a consensus it could be a dictator king
(3:38:04) imposes the rules and the consensus disagrees so you have that too but in general what I'm saying again your whole
(3:38:10) my side okay if that is true reason your side is the Bible so if that's true
(3:38:16) let's find out the Bible says this that's Adam I just have one question one question then you can do your internal
(3:38:21) critique why you don't get to do 50 questions in a row you can do your internal critique let me ask a question
(3:38:26) almost done Adam and then you can do your internal critique okay I'm almost done so I just got to ask you this last
(3:38:32) thing then if it is true that morality comes from consensus or by edict of a
(3:38:37) single man if that's where you believe morality comes from how can you make a single argument against circumcision go
(3:38:42) ahead tell me why circumcision would be wrong if the majority of people want it adam sure that's easy because it's wrong
(3:38:49) to cut off people's body parts without their consent
(3:38:55) how is circumcision yeah thank you for And I would argue the majority of women do not actually want circumcision they
(3:39:02) might think they do because they've never slept with an uncircumcised man but I promise you the minute that you
(3:39:07) sleep with an uncircumcised man you will never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
(3:39:14) ever want circumcision again circumcision is evil circumcision is
(3:39:20) robbing people of pleasure that they are otherwise entitled to it's wrong and no
(3:39:27) woman who has ever slept with an uncircumcised man thinks any differently
(3:39:33) because it's just fact it just I'm sorry i'm not trying to make the men who are circumcised against their will feel bad
(3:39:39) because it's not like you guys can't be good at sex you feel just fine i don't want you to have a complex about it i'm
(3:39:44) just saying that uncircumcised men feel
(3:39:54) better it's true and I'm not I'm not even ashamed to admit it it feels better
(3:39:59) okay my husband is uncircumcised i'm very happy i'm a very happy woman
(3:40:04) okay
(3:40:10) great question you're a guy i I'm sure my husband is thrilled that people know the status of his cock on the internet
(3:40:15) but he I'm just saying it's it's a good it's a positive status
(3:40:21) one true God of the universe that demands us to chop off uh 8day year old babies the
(3:40:28) foreskins under tremendous pain that probably caused so many uh uh infections
(3:40:34) and death throughout history your God created us almost perfect just needed to
(3:40:39) chop off those foreskin to have your special covenant with your fake Hebrew deity i'm glad you brought this up easily it causes harm they don't have
(3:40:47) consent they um they're too young to agree to it it's a cosmetic surgery that
(3:40:53) has a huge risk there's morality comes from consensus Adam no I didn't none of I did I did I say where does it come
(3:40:58) from Adam did I say a consensus where does it come yes you did you said it either comes from consensus or a king
(3:41:05) it's genital mutilation okay then where does Okay so then I'm going to ask you something that I disagree with morality
(3:41:13) i I'll grant you that Christian society okay okay so then so then all morality then No well we're not done does all
(3:41:20) morality i'm not doing your runaround anymore man i I What run we're in the middle of a debate
(3:41:27) and you just question a question i'm going to have to be a harder moderator than I want to be
(3:41:34) because that's not my style but obviously I'm gonna have to do that um
(3:41:39) do you believe in circumcision Andrew no no the Orthodox
(3:41:45) Church uh has specifically said circumcision is not a requirement of
(3:41:51) orthodoxy so then what are we even arguing about like exactly well here's
(3:41:56) what we're arguing about and I'll explain what I'm trying to figure out what what I'm trying to figure out and
(3:42:01) Adam has been obscating from he's terrified of this question no I haven't answering directly took your earphones
(3:42:07) out like a pansy adam gentlemen gentlemen gentlemen
(3:42:12) gentlemen hey okay look look look look look look i don't like being a heavy-handed
(3:42:20) moderator i explained that at the beginning but obviously I'm going to have to assert myself a little bit um
(3:42:28) first off we haven't really moved off the first topic i mean I I guess it's kind of evolved a little bit but it it's
(3:42:35) still like the same well we're on ethics we're on We're on meta ethics but it
(3:42:41) it's it's kind of it's kind of the same i I have a couple super chat questions
(3:42:46) here well then then Ralph all I all I wanted to know is this one key thing
(3:42:52) okay well and Adam Adam just will not answer this no matter what and that's
(3:42:58) hanging on my own look look look you haven't It's unfair for me to not answer
(3:43:06) your questions if you were refusing answer i will give you one question and then Adam will get two questions because
(3:43:12) you've asked more is that fair yeah that's fine punished Gosling sent three i actually want you to not offiscate
(3:43:18) though Adam and actually answer this it's important the reason I've been asked this entire inquiry is to figure
(3:43:24) this out where does Adam Green believe morality comes from if it's not by
(3:43:31) consensus if it's not by a king then what to Adam is moral other than Adam's
(3:43:36) personal preferences other than what Adam believes what external to Adam is moral that's my question okay now you
(3:43:45) answer that Adam and you get two questions because I'm going to be honest
(3:43:50) you have asked more questions Andrew i think that's fair to say i don't think you dispute that now go ahead Adam this
(3:43:57) is the same transcendental argument trick that they all don't interrupt don't interrupt please explain where
(3:44:05) logic and morals come from otherwise I assert my god they come from my god where's your proof that they come from
(3:44:12) your god in the bible nazi you haven't answered my question yet go ahead and answer what is
(3:44:18) it?iety from cultural culture on what morals are that's why morals have
(3:44:23) changed and if that's the entailment Adam then if that's the entailment Adam then you can't make an argument against
(3:44:30) circumcision because it's just the moral of the reverse why is circumcision moral
(3:44:37) why why is general mutilation of young boys moral and from so so here because
(3:44:42) from a secular view there is no way for me to give any type of objective i'm
(3:44:49) trying to answer your question okay go ahead from a secular viewpoint it would
(3:44:55) be impossible absolutely impossible for me to give you a reason why it would be immoral to circumcise a young boy
(3:45:02) external my own preferences all I want you to say I just gave you a reason
(3:45:07) external immoral then you're religious how howal I'm trying to explain it to you as a young boy how All right we got
(3:45:14) another super chat rottweiler does Andrew realize if he had been born in say Iran he would most certainly be
(3:45:20) Muslim and all of his moral arguments would be coming would come from quoting the Quran i don't think he does realize
(3:45:25) that Rob no but I think that's a great super chat thank you so much
(3:45:30) bro stop talking so I can answer your question so if you're a secularist and
(3:45:36) you make the bold claim that morality either comes from your preference or from society or something like this
(3:45:42) which is just a collective of preferences then there is actually no way for you to say that if society comes
(3:45:49) together and all of them collectively say that you should be able to circumcise children you can't make an
(3:45:55) argument against that and you know it which is why you won't tell us what you base your morality on and you still
(3:46:00) haven't actually answered my question i told you and you reiterated it to everybody is it your preferences or is
(3:46:06) it society societyy's deciding on what's moral that's generally how you can't make the argument that it's immoral to
(3:46:12) circumcise kids if so it's a social construct come up with well fine then
(3:46:18) Adam if it's a social construct then anything that I as being moral is including circumcision regardless of
(3:46:24) reason regardless of reasons that you What do you mean I gave you reasons why I think it's immoral what are your
(3:46:30) reasons to argue from a Christian perspective that circumcision is Why would I ever need to argue from a
(3:46:36) Christian perspective it's impossible god said so god
(3:46:43) commanded it so it's good as validular no no no no it's just as valid
(3:46:49) any reason that I give you inside of a social construction meaning does not exist in objective morality or in
(3:46:56) objective reality uh any reason I give you you know what circumcision is moral
(3:47:02) because this remote is on my table that's why it's moral can you powerful
(3:47:08) argument bro yeah yeah bro can you refute it powerful argument can you give me the reason that it's immoral can you
(3:47:14) refute that it's immoral because this remote is on my table refute it i want to hear i'm asking you why is it more
(3:47:21) than I just told you cuz this remote's on my table you just said you were against circumcision though right yeah
(3:47:26) but I'm I'm going to grant the argument this remote's on my table that's why circumcision is moral tell me why I'm
(3:47:33) wrong worst nonsequator I've ever heard it's got nothing to do to do with it tell me why I'm wrong
(3:47:39) oh man this is what I mean when I say I don't like debate tactics i don't like this i don't like this this is not about
(3:47:47) truth this is not about having an exchange of ideas this is only about how can I use debate tactics to own my
(3:47:54) opponent and it's gross and it's annoying and it's frustrating and Andrew Wilson is much smarter than this and he
(3:48:01) should be acting like he's much smarter than this adam Green won this debate like an hour ago so far as I'm concerned
(3:48:07) just because Andrew keeps meandering around to topics that have nothing to do with what's actually being
(3:48:12) discussed and it's annoying and frustrating and Adam wins and I was I
(3:48:18) was fully prepared today to take Andrew Wilson's side i really was but Adam is winning this debate and
(3:48:25) allegedly my pizza's going to be here in like 18 minutes and so we're gonna watch until my pizza's here and then I'm going
(3:48:31) to go eat dinner after that this is the worst argument I've ever heard are you ever going to get to why
(3:48:37) it's wrong address how a remote control it's moral because this lighter moral
(3:48:42) it's mor it's moral because this lighter makes flame i can't even address it you can't address it you won't answer you
(3:48:48) refuse to answer how stupid i can't even make an argument is retarded adam's final no I I listen I
(3:48:57) appreciate the super chats i do i adore you you're welcome on this channel you're a member on this channel you're
(3:49:03) welcome to be here i disagree vehemently that Adam has lost this debate i
(3:49:09) disagree me i understand your position and you can disagree with Adam but
(3:49:14) Andrew has taken this debate on a meandering path that has nothing to do with the actual topic
(3:49:24) enemy a remote control that's funny all right now let me ask some of these and then we could move maybe to more of the
(3:49:31) core of the discussion um uh says "Lol this is another BS argument from he's
(3:49:38) saying this." Jew worshipper Andrew cancer destroying technology would be an actual benefit for us no matter who made
(3:49:46) it um how has a desert religion from Jews helped humanity yeah language is a
(3:49:53) technology uh secularists would consider religion to be a technology uh you can
(3:49:59) basic almost everything uh that you consider in reality which is of some use
(3:50:04) to people is a form of technology when you're talking about Christianity from a secularist perspective it can't really
(3:50:10) be viewed as anything but that there's some type of technological viewpoint which you can take whether it's uh the
(3:50:16) great buildings which are made or some type of morality which people follow you would have to concede it's a technology
(3:50:22) what else would you say it is no I'm secular and I would completely disagree that Christianity is a technology okay
(3:50:28) what's a technology it is a psychological manipulation it is a basology
(3:50:35) to control you okay well let's start with what a technology is what is it uh
(3:50:41) how would I define technology yeah define technology you always ask these these questions that nobody's ever
(3:50:46) thought of well you can't no one's ever thought of what a technology is Adam really i think of technology as like
(3:50:53) Yeah define technology what does technology mean do you know who has thought of what technology is
(3:50:58) scientologists scientologists say everything is a technology and Andrew Wilson right now is kind of sounding a
(3:51:05) little bit like Scientology and Scientology is bad and a cult and I don't want to be part of Scientology
(3:51:11) either so Andrew Wilson is basically a Scientologist and Adam Green is fighting against Scientology and therefore Adam
(3:51:18) Green is right and Andrew Wilson is wrong miro under Adam's argument
(3:51:23) pedophilia is only immoral because society said no not because it's evil he
(3:51:28) has argued against the concept of objective evil i mean I think the p that you can make the argument that
(3:51:34) pedophilia is wrong because you are you are corrupting a life force in some way
(3:51:40) like sexual abuse is never correct whether it's an adult or a child and so therefore karma states that it's wrong
(3:51:47) and you will experience the karma of whatever your actions are and therefore you shouldn't do that
(3:51:53) shit but that's just my argument i haven't heard I have not heard Adam
(3:51:58) Green make this argument and so I'm not going to ascribe this argument to him just because you're saying he made this
(3:52:04) argument doesn't mean he's made this argument i would say like inventions or
(3:52:12) uh devices you know scientific uh advance not not wouldn't be scientific
(3:52:19) discoveries would not be a technology uh I'd say scientific inventions would be a
(3:52:25) technology you know computers telephones electronics that's
(3:52:30) technologies i mean if you want to stretch the word you could say Christianity is like I don't I don't see
(3:52:35) how you can say it's a technology it's a psychological manipulation is language is language a technology theology it's
(3:52:41) not a technology it's a theology okay is language a technology um
(3:52:51) I I wouldn't define it as technology no what would it be i don't know dude what the fuck does it matter can I ask a
(3:52:57) question yet the reason The reason that it matters is you made a claim what is What is technology like what relevance
(3:53:04) does that have to any because you said because you made a claim you said you said thing X is not a technology i said
(3:53:10) okay that's a fair claim to make what is technology then so that we have a tight definition so we can test the claim how
(3:53:17) is techicalology i don't care if you don't care i want to know what it is what all right now let me ask my
(3:53:23) question so lang hang on i just want to make sure there's not a technology even got the second question and to be clear
(3:53:29) uh I haven't gotten my I haven't gotten any of my questions in actually okay go ahead Adam all right so your moral god
(3:53:36) let me ask you do you think it's moral to eternally punish your own creation
(3:53:42) simply because they aren't convinced and have faith
(3:53:48) already cut which is just God said go ahead wait hang on hang on we got
(3:53:53) another super chat from Mero Adam literally just said morality comes from society in general or one
(3:53:59) person if that's not morality comes I if that's where morality comes from their morality is not objective I think Adam
(3:54:06) is being bastardized into that argument i don't think that's what Adam actually believes and this is what my argument is
(3:54:13) against debate tactics because debate tactics are just about forcing your opponents to make some sort of technical
(3:54:19) error they're not about what anyone actually believes it's not about what the truth is and so I don't think this
(3:54:24) is an accurate representation of what Adam actually believes and so I'm going to reject this fundamentally because
(3:54:31) what Adam actually believes should matter in this you saying Adam believes
(3:54:38) X Y B and Z if Adam doesn't agree with that then he doesn't actually believe
(3:54:46) that one second it'll it'll clear up it's not me um Adam are you there
(3:54:55) that would be okay go ahead now repeat what you're going to say okay the whole thing you didn't catch any of it no no
(3:55:02) okay do you Andrew do you think it's moral to eternally punish your own creation God's own creation if they
(3:55:08) aren't convinced and have faith that God sacrificed himself to himself to defeat Satan according to the prophecies of the
(3:55:15) Jews is it moral to eternal eternally punish people for not being convinced of
(3:55:20) ancient mythical stories is that moral yeah so this is um I'm going to answer
(3:55:26) this in two parts so that you understand both parts from a secular perspective everything God does is moral everything
(3:55:32) it's impossible for it not to be because it's a sleet of preferences it wouldn't matter if God destroyed all of you for
(3:55:39) funsies if that's his preference it's every bit as valid as your own you have no argument for this you can't tell me
(3:55:46) why you cannot tell me why you just allude to the fact that that all ethics
(3:55:51) come from society so if greater society said we believe in God God's going to destroy everybody you would have to
(3:55:56) concede that that is moral adam that is one two when it comes to the kind of
(3:56:03) loaded underpinning of what is moral absent an objectively moral or morality
(3:56:09) objective morality meaning a source I believe that God is the source of
(3:56:14) objective morals you can dispute that what God says is moral or immoral it
(3:56:19) wouldn't really matter because you're a subjectivist how do you know that answer your question no so from a subjective
(3:56:28) perspective there is nothing I could ever do ever that you can say is immoral
(3:56:35) external your preference which you could never make a case is less or more valid than my own so if my god if you think
(3:56:41) he's aidal evil maniacal slave owning lunatic it wouldn't matter because you
(3:56:48) can't make the claim you can't actually dispute why it would be immoral other than Adam Green don't like it that's it
(3:56:54) no I can make other arguments besides I don't like them i'll appeal to actual arguments and evidence in the real world
(3:57:03) and you can only appeal to my God says so my Jewish appeal to those how do you know
(3:57:09) your Jewish God is moral you already answered because he says he's moral like that's circular that's why you think
(3:57:14) you're moral no you just conceded that God is moral and everything he does is going to be moral all I showed you is
(3:57:20) this if you hold on let me finish that just proves that you will circle the wagons and you will come up with any
(3:57:25) excuse any rational rationalization to justify everything God does in the Bible
(3:57:30) and every critique we can come with Christianity exactly what you do he's moral cuz he says he's moral and you don't have exactly what you do my pizza
(3:57:37) is getting delivered in 20 minutes it's the most exciting thing ever i'm having uh buffalo chicken i'm having buffalo
(3:57:45) sauce with pepperoni pizza for you nosy types
(3:57:50) no marinara buffalo only it's gonna be great huh sure so here's So here's your
(3:57:55) so here's Adam Green circular argument adam Green is the arbiter of all that is moral adam Green is the arbiter of all
(3:58:02) that is moral adam Green is the arbiter of all that is moral adam Green is the arbiter of all that is moral that's your argument that's not his argument
(3:58:08) literally about how Adam actually that's not moral because of this and this and this and I might change my mind i
(3:58:14) wouldn't go but my Bible says no so you're wrong that's what you do yeah yeah but you saying that you would change your mind still infers that you
(3:58:21) think you're the arbiter of everything that's moral Adam so why while at the same time you rage against God because
(3:58:26) you say God is the arbiter of all that is you think you're the arbiter of all that's moral you think you're the
(3:58:32) ultimate arbiter of everything which is moral you are the repeating yourself and I already
(3:58:38) addressed that point so no you didn't address it how are you not the the arbiter of all that is moral because you
(3:58:44) can change your mind and then it's moral right i told you i told you yeah I could people can have their minds con uh changed on what makes it moral just like
(3:58:51) Christians have just like Christians adam what makes it moral their morality has evolved as well too so and what
(3:58:57) makes it moral just that you think so right so it's circular it's a big only moral if your Jewish your Jewish priests
(3:59:03) say that say that it's only moral if you spurn about Jews that's what makes it moral oh my god that's what makes it
(3:59:09) moral adaming about Jews now you hit on that in your open um do you think that
(3:59:15) Adam Spur's about No you were Okay it's God I can't even
(3:59:22) keep up do get another question in if you want and then he gave a two-part
(3:59:28) answer i got another question fair enough go ahead go ahead since you're declaring that your God is where all
(3:59:33) morals come from I want to ask you do you think this is moral can you argue and defend that this is moral all right
(3:59:42) i would say you can't really love a god and worship a god if it's by threat of
(3:59:47) punishment and eternal consequences true would it be moral if I had uh I had a ch
(3:59:55) child and I said you better love me or I'm going to whip you and abuse you forever would that be moral
(4:00:03) uh depending on cir Well so here let's look at again I'll break it down in two parts
(4:00:09) could it be moral it could be so let me break it down in two parts part one if
(4:00:16) it is true that this is something which is immoral Adam Green would be the
(4:00:23) ultimate arbiter of that that that's Adam Green's logic adam Green is the ultimate arbiter of what is moral when
(4:00:29) it comes to children so he's asking me a question about morality and regardless of the answer that I give any assertion
(4:00:36) that I make is every bit as valid as his yes Adam it's moral or Adam it's not
(4:00:41) moral wouldn't matter because ultimately you think you're the arbiter of all things which are moral so if I appeal to
(4:00:47) God and say to you God would not want you to abuse your children adam seems like the cooler guy would say God does
(4:00:55) say and such and such Adam absolutely seems like the cooler guy to hang out with at the bar of the Bible that you
(4:01:02) can abuse your children so what the only dispute that you have to this is that Adam Green doesn't think that's moral do
(4:01:09) you understand that yet not what his statement is
(4:01:14) sorry you cut the very last part what did you say i said your only regardless
(4:01:19) of my answer whether I said it's moral or immoral the only case you could make for why it was or is or is not is based
(4:01:28) on Adam Green being the ultimate arbiter of what is moral no I'll ask I'll ask
(4:01:33) everybody in the chat do you think it's moral well then we're back to it just a same problem
(4:01:38) but problem so dude it's so sad you can't This is
(4:01:43) why Christianity is hugely problematic you can't even acknowledge that it's not moral to threaten your children that
(4:01:50) they have to love you adam's premise Adam's actual
(4:01:56) premise is that Jesus is a Jewish myth
(4:02:01) that Jesus was created by the Jews in order to give the Gentiles all the
(4:02:08) non-Jews in the world a Jewish God to worship so that they could control the
(4:02:14) Gentiles while still remaining God's chosen people or something like that i don't know if he would agree with that
(4:02:20) exact interpretation but that's the bas basis of his argument that all of Christianity was created by the Jews to
(4:02:27) control the Gentiles all like everything related to Jesus was created by the Jews to control the
(4:02:33) Gentiles and of course they're not talking about that at all because Andrew Wilson has taken the debate and
(4:02:39) meandered it around
(4:02:45) otherwise you're going to terrorize them and punish them adam Adam this is the
(4:02:50) problem this is the problem this is the problem with secularism adam you couldn't even tell me what love is is it
(4:02:57) a chemical response no it's an emotion that's all it is
(4:03:03) come on as far as I know yeah so I don't think I don't think there's any love going on without a brain if it's just a
(4:03:10) bunch of chemical responses if that's all that love is right and this is all
(4:03:16) that morality is is just a grouping of chemical responses then as long as I
(4:03:21) engineered people's chemicals slightly differently so that they no longer had love for each other you would have to
(4:03:27) concede that that's moral right Adam hold on say that again you could not
(4:03:32) have all people in the world genetically I altered them so that they no longer had the chemical response of love right
(4:03:40) anything that those people then did absent love you would consider that to be moral by your standard right moral
(4:03:48) dude these hypotheticals Andrew if you could genetically engineer all people to
(4:03:54) not have a brain chemical uh ox uh what is it uh
(4:04:00) okay listen I'm reading these out of respect that you're sending me money adam's premise is wrong i disagree with
(4:04:07) you but that's okay if I tell my son if you kill that man you're getting 20 to
(4:04:13) life that's not abuse that's me laying down the rules and letting you make that choice but you're making the assumption
(4:04:18) that the Christian God is the only thing laying down the rules which is not true
(4:04:25) it's just provably not true there were belief systems before your Christian God
(4:04:31) there are belief systems after your Christian God your Christian God is not the only one laying down how the world
(4:04:39) works and that's what you don't want to acknowledge but I appreciate the money hey you send me a lot of super chats i
(4:04:45) appreciate the money thank you keep sending me super chats i I'm going to keep reading them on stream but you're
(4:04:53) wrong because you're a Christian God and listen man I don't care if you're a
(4:04:58) Christian if you want to be a Christian fine fine whatever you're going to heaven the rest of us are burning in
(4:05:04) hell fine like whatever but there are other belief systems in the world that are not yours
(4:05:13) oxytocin yeah the other chemicals that are experienced like like love and positive feelings uh you're going to
(4:05:18) engineer people to not have that yeah and then that's not moral is that what you said yeah no so let me ask you again
(4:05:26) love is just a a grouping of chemical responses yes or no no yeah as far as I know yeah okay great so we got we we've
(4:05:33) established that it's just a grouping of chemical what do you think it is if you don't think that's what Adam Stop Adam i'm walking you through the logic and
(4:05:40) you can ask me after you're done answering so then we move on to step two if it is true that love is just a
(4:05:46) grouping of chemical responses that's all that it is if those chemicals were somehow diverted let's say the sun went
(4:05:52) I don't know uh got brighter and somehow that got rid of this chemical that
(4:05:57) causes love inside of that society if they did human sacrifice if they cut out
(4:06:02) babies tongues if they murdered people with wild abandon if they raped they pillaged they killed everything in sight
(4:06:08) can you tell me why that would be immoral Adam i don't see what not having love fucking
(4:06:16) question i'm trying to I'm trying to answer i don't see what not having love
(4:06:22) spinning tires sent $3 please take a bong rip on stream chemical 4207
(4:06:29) where you're going with this morality without Christian so one more
(4:06:36) so let me ask you let me ask you again now that you're back now that you're back debates over thousands of years
(4:06:42) saying that you can or you can't uh so now that you're back I want to ask the question again if bro there are other
(4:06:51) belief systems that are not Buddhism or Shintoism or any of those things there
(4:06:57) are belief systems that are much older than all of those things the fact that
(4:07:02) you guys don't know this is a you problem it's not an US
