 (Music)

[01:00:03:07 - 01:00:13:28]
Speaker 1
 You

[01:00:13:28 - 01:00:35:07]
Speaker 2
 will each have a five-minute opening statement where you will introduce yourself as you like and then the rest of the show will be open conversation with some prompt changes and breaks for messages from the audience and then you will each have a five-minute closing statement and you're going to open so go ahead.

[01:00:35:07 - 01:00:42:19]
Speaker 3
 My name is Rafael Gomez I'm the host of Women on Men where I interview women about men and dating and here's my opening statement.

[01:00:43:21 - 01:00:46:08]
Speaker 3
 I'm not here to fight men I'm here to fight for them.

[01:00:47:28 - 01:00:50:09]
Speaker 1
 Okay I mean I feel like it's

[01:00:51:25 - 01:00:59:00]
Speaker 1
 well he's a man and he's a man they're gonna have a fight pretty sure well not physical but

[01:01:01:18 - 01:01:07:13]
Speaker 1
 I think it's gonna be that way whether he's there to do that or not.

[01:01:08:25 - 01:01:11:13]
Speaker 3
 Because the red pill is presented as medicine but it's act-

[01:01:11:13 - 01:01:19:06]
Speaker 1
 let me guess Andrew here is gonna be like oh I'm not the red pill I have nothing to do with the red pill. Okay.

[01:01:19:06 - 01:01:28:22]
Speaker 3
 Actually a poison and peer reviewed research proves it. Red pill and manosphere content preys on angry rejected men and turns their pain into blame.

[01:01:28:22 - 01:01:33:13]
Speaker 1
 It tells- yeah I mean that's that's fair.

[01:01:34:28 - 01:01:56:05]
Speaker 3
 Women are the enemy that dating is a war and they're losing. That feminism ruined everything. The very people they want to date become their adversaries and it's easier to buy into that story than to look inward but the science is clear. Studies consistently show that red pill communities promote hostile sexism dehumanized women and radicalized male pain into misogyny.

[01:01:56:05 - 01:02:01:06]
Speaker 1
 And the top- okay I mean I kind of see all that being

[01:02:02:07 - 01:02:22:10]
Speaker 1
 more or less obviously sure I didn't know there actually studies on this that's kind of interesting. I'm curious to see that exactly how you could even study something like that I mean do you just what ask people opinions and kind of aggregate them and hope they tell the truth or do you yeah I'm not sure maybe maybe he'll get into it.

[01:02:22:10 - 01:02:41:21]
Speaker 3
 To top it off it's not helping them date either. Men who endorse red pill beliefs report higher levels of loneliness romantic dissatisfaction and psychological distress but the consequences are real and deadly. Just a short drive from this studio Elliot Roger murders six people at UC Santa Barbara with the manifesto filled with hatred for women.

[01:02:41:21 - 01:04:37:00]
Speaker 1
 I can't see the naughty words I guess maybe I'll have to blur it out but um Elliot Roger I remember looking into that somewhere recently for some reason um he was I don't know if you've heard about the guy but he was basically complaining about how no one wants him and he just his whole this was actually kind of uh this was pretty weird but his whole thing was he would go and basically try to you know look pretty um try to be all oh god you know use new outfit I'm gonna and then he would let go places where he thinks the women hang out in their natural habitat you know parks college was like a big one he's like I'm gonna go to college and all these women he wanted like these blondes especially these blond beautiful women and they're just kind of hang out there you know in the wild where they naturally are and he could just sneak in there and just sit there and position himself just right and wait for the women to come to him and I guess he had some kind of idea where some beautiful blonde woman would just notice how he was just sitting there all you know mysterious and pretty and come up to him and be like please f me and when that obviously never happened he went on our page and just shot people I think he wanted to kill I think he wanted to off a bunch of uh young ladies in a sorority but they locked the door and I guess he couldn't get in because the door was locked

[01:04:38:02 - 01:05:05:12]
Speaker 1
 because they were kind of freaked out like who is this guy so he ended up shooting a few outside of it and just went in like randomly started shooting people around the college area and then you know himself as well in the car he had a slummy festo for some reason he was his hero to a bunch of people who were also insults but I mean really this guy

[01:05:11:22 - 01:05:12:00]
Speaker 1
 yeah

[01:05:16:04 - 01:05:19:28]
Speaker 4
 don't do that don't do what don't do the manifesto

[01:05:21:01 - 01:05:25:26]
Speaker 4
 don't do that for youtube purposes like just skip that part or maybe okay he made the

[01:05:25:26 - 01:06:06:08]
Speaker 3
 point go ahead okay and he became martyr for red pill communities a symbol of what happens when male pain festers into violence for all the lectures about female nature and alpha dominance red pill men aren't forming real relationships they're staying single bitter and stuck the more they consume this content the worse their life gets not because women changed but because they did in the end it leaves them lonely angry and blaming everyone but the ideology that failed them just this week andrew called red pill creators degenerates for pushing casual sex discouraging marriage and obsessing over status yet here he is today defending that same ecosystem he also said that the divide between men and

[01:06:06:08 - 01:06:09:12]
Speaker 1
 he was a little little girl there

[01:06:12:12 - 01:06:37:13]
Speaker 1
 but yeah i mean i don't know what he's talking about there about him calling somebody degenerates for not doing you know christian values but the kind of hypocrite that he's appears to be i wouldn't be surprised if he just keeps calling people out oh you know himself is not quite fitting of those values

[01:06:38:21 - 01:06:45:23]
Speaker 1
 he reports but he just freaking chews i'm sure some of them he fits because you know he's married or whatever and that's such a big deal but

[01:06:47:01 - 01:06:57:12]
Speaker 1
 some of the other things that are supposed to be christian values it's like oh hmm i like these ones but not these ones well that'll get him to it

[01:06:57:12 - 01:07:14:23]
Speaker 3
 and then women is a good thing because he believes women will cave first andrew wants to keep that division wide because it serves his personal crusade to eradicate feminism even if it means sacrificing the well-being of the very men he claims to protect that's my opening statement okay so

[01:07:14:23 - 01:07:41:27]
Speaker 1
 look at this that's pretty short i don't think that was five minutes and only three minutes in it's definitely not five minutes of an opening but pretty to the point um i don't know if i disagree with a whole lot there um some of the things i'm just not aware of what he what he means by them but um you know like some calling some derrick's i don't know what that's about i'm not sure exactly what studies he's talking about but you might be looking into it but yeah kind of to the point

[01:07:41:27 - 01:07:52:27]
Speaker 4
 so i'll respond a few things by the way my name is andrew wilson the host of the crucible uh welcome to

[01:07:52:27 - 01:08:11:27]
Speaker 1
 oh this time he didn't say hey what is it he says a popular entertainment platform yeah i'm surprised he didn't do that this time i don't know if he's started to realize it's a little cringe to be like oh it's a popular thing that i do it's so popular but it's interesting he's not saying it like that anymore

[01:08:13:27 - 01:08:44:12]
Speaker 4
 to well actually thank you guys for having me especially the whatever podcast chat always nice to be back with you guys and of course the crucible crew uh thank my opponent for coming out as well for this um so the first thing is you mentioned that the the red pill is poison uh and women are enemies adversaries i think that you're making a very classic mistake that many people make which is that you're associating content creators and their views with what the red pill is and so maybe we can get in wait

[01:08:44:12 - 01:09:26:21]
Speaker 1
 oh this i totally expected this it's it's classic oh i'm not the red pill the red pill is this other thing and i'm totally not part of that even though okay what's different i mean i'm sure in any kind of um situation where there's a group of people that tend to kind of label themselves a certain way they all have disagreements here and there but for the most part they kind of see like okay they agree on a lot and i i know how he really likes to kind of distance himself because um i guess he's realized that like the red pill is kind of a dirty word and he doesn't want to be associated with a dirty word but what's different you know let us know

[01:09:26:21 - 01:09:40:03]
Speaker 4
 and what you think the red pill actually is um so you say that um the red pill is making men stay single and uh and stay miserable

[01:09:40:03 - 01:09:45:18]
Speaker 1
 he's gonna do that a lot i guarantee it is so like it's like smoking kind of people

[01:09:48:00 - 01:09:51:07]
Speaker 1
 and it's just so fake like etc

[01:09:51:07 - 01:10:01:24]
Speaker 4
 etc uh we can get into that too uh i actually didn't say that uh red pillars were degenerates and i'm guessing that you're referencing the pearl davis debate

[01:10:01:24 - 01:10:07:09]
Speaker 3
 uh no you said this on your channel you were talking to a gentleman on your own channel i can't remember he was sorry

[01:10:07:09 - 01:10:45:23]
Speaker 1
 um did he say pearl davis debate uh i saw some of that i don't know if it ever got into like a debate sort of situation because maybe i mean i didn't sit there and watch the whole thing um kind of focused on it the whole time i think i had it on in the background but i heard some of it and all the parts that i've heard of it there wasn't really much of a debate it was more just like her asking some questions and sort of like fangirling over him uh i don't know what part of that was a debate like there might have been like a minor disagreement here and there but i wouldn't call it a pearl debate

[01:10:47:08 - 01:10:51:22]
Speaker 3
 i was talking on an ipad you didn't like the sound it was something you posted i think tuesday okay

[01:10:51:22 - 01:11:35:04]
Speaker 4
 yeah yeah so um there are a lot of degenerates who are red pillars but i didn't i wouldn't make the claim that the red pill to me is just a descriptive packet uh and you say that andrew wants uh feminism to be destroyed at the expense of men is the opposite i want feminism to be destroyed because i think that that protects and helps in assist men so i'm talking about a gender divide um what what i'm what i'm disassociating is that there needs to be when i say gender divide women in the role of female gender roles and men in the role of male gender roles so that's the divide i'm looking at now i'm not looking at a divide of uh like men and women not being close to each other i'm looking at the divide

[01:11:35:04 - 01:11:36:24]
Speaker 1
 okay nobody's

[01:11:38:09 - 01:12:13:16]
Speaker 1
 i don't i don't think anybody was saying that he like specifically wants men and women to be far far apart from each other he was more saying he was saying it was more like what what you um the things that you uh kind of prescribe cause that distance not that you intend for that distance to be the goal it's just kind of the effect whether you intend it or not um slightly different but okay

[01:12:13:16 - 01:12:22:20]
Speaker 4
 divided i don't want uh sameness when it comes to gender roles because that's really bad and it does not suit society very well so

[01:12:22:20 - 01:12:24:02]
Speaker 1
 that's really bad

[01:12:25:22 - 01:12:31:13]
Speaker 1
 you'll hurt it here andrew wilson that's really bad some found

[01:12:31:13 - 01:12:36:23]
Speaker 4
 um kind of with that i'm happy to just kind of dive into whatever you want here

[01:12:36:23 - 01:12:39:15]
Speaker 3
 sure um okay

[01:12:39:15 - 01:12:50:26]
Speaker 1
 yeah that was also very short he didn't seem to have like his um prepared interest statement i know i know that was to each have what five minutes of like a little speech they give it to begin with where they kind of define

[01:12:51:27 - 01:13:00:06]
Speaker 1
 their position and kind of some key points here um you know this guy on the right here he had some um what's his name

[01:13:08:18 - 01:13:18:23]
Speaker 1
 um no it just called woke male feminist tater

[01:13:20:04 - 01:13:22:24]
Speaker 1
 okay let me see if i can find this name

[01:13:24:11 - 01:13:29:06]
Speaker 2
 hi lance for all the self as you like and then the rest of the show will

[01:13:30:14 - 01:13:35:04]
Speaker 2
 will be open conversation about a gender divide that's my opening statement

[01:13:35:04 - 01:13:40:24]
Speaker 3
 the red pill communities promote hot the red pill communities promote

[01:13:40:24 - 01:13:58:21]
Speaker 2
 yourself as you like and then the rest of the show will be open conversation with some prompt changes and breaks for messages from the audience and then you will each have a five minute closing statement and you're gonna open so go ahead my

[01:13:58:21 - 01:14:08:13]
Speaker 3
 name is rafael gomez i'm the host of women

[01:14:08:13 - 01:14:11:28]
Speaker 1
 sure okay so his name is rafael gomez

[01:14:13:27 - 01:14:19:28]
Speaker 3
 or um so i know you say the red pill is kind of this ideology but red pill not an

[01:14:19:28 - 01:14:23:13]
Speaker 5
 ideology whatever word you used um it's a packet it's a

[01:14:23:13 - 01:14:47:23]
Speaker 3
 data packet i've heard you say that i understand um but the only way that message is really disseminated is often through these big content creators most of the people come across the red pill from things like fresh and fit andrew tate this channel um it's that's how that packet is distributed and there are prescriptive messages how do they come across it i don't know the internet is the internet the algorithm do you think they made it up do i think who made it what does that matter

[01:14:47:23 - 01:14:52:15]
Speaker 4
 it up that those red pill creators that you're talking about do you think that they just made all that stuff

[01:14:52:15 - 01:14:53:21]
Speaker 3
 no i don't i think there's too

[01:14:53:21 - 01:14:57:13]
Speaker 5
 many similar messages for it to be made up yeah so there's like sources for this stuff right

[01:14:57:13 - 01:15:00:10]
Speaker 3
 wherever they're sourcing it so i'm not sure what they're

[01:15:00:10 - 01:15:33:07]
Speaker 4
 disseminating it so like one such source would be a guy his name is rolo tamasi um the godfather of red pill he's going to be pissed and i said that because it's like an ongoing meme but um he calls it a praxeology right so if it's if it's praxeological from his perspective he's saying there's no prescriptions here right it's not it's not designed around prescriptors it's designed around descriptors so if you're going to criticize the red pill you should probably start by criticizing the descriptors um but if you wanted

[01:15:33:07 - 01:16:36:18]
Speaker 1
 okay so i think what he's trying to say is oh the red pill is this thing where we don't really tell you what to do but we kind of say oh here's how the world is um i think that's what he's trying to say here in these big fancy words um praxeology i haven't heard that before i've heard praxis um haven't heard praxeology uh personally um but yeah that's that sounds like what he's trying to say is basically we don't tell men what to do we just tell them how the world is it just so happens that the way they they describe the world and how it's supposedly is um basically leads in one very narrow um direction of how to act how to act and what to do about it basically and i wouldn't say they don't prescribe i mean i've heard them prescribe on what to do um quite a bit so i don't know why he's saying that i mean i kind of guess but whatever

[01:16:36:18 - 01:16:53:24]
Speaker 4
 wanted to criticize individual content creators for their prescriptions i think that that's fine but that's not the red pill the red pill is a data packet of descriptions which are trying to express and explain interpersonal sexual dynamics between men and women

[01:16:53:24 - 01:17:05:04]
Speaker 3
 i think the gentleman you mentioned most people haven't heard of um i think most people have heard of them i think most of the people are getting their information from the millions of subscriptions to freshen fit and whatever and fresh

[01:17:05:04 - 01:17:08:14]
Speaker 4
 and fit he goes on often they have a very close myring

[01:17:08:14 - 01:17:11:05]
Speaker 5
 gains i'm sure is much more popular than him yeah well

[01:17:11:05 - 01:17:19:00]
Speaker 4
 the thing is is like maybe but myron gains is not are you saying he's the red pill i think he's one of them okay so what so what

[01:17:19:00 - 01:17:20:16]
Speaker 5
 is let's start with that what is the red pill

[01:17:20:16 - 01:17:25:27]
Speaker 3
 i consider it content that claims to reveal the truth about women but promotes misogyny and male victimhood

[01:17:25:27 - 01:17:31:08]
Speaker 4
 okay so um you think that the descriptors do that

[01:17:31:08 - 01:17:33:22]
Speaker 3
 i think the content creators that are prescribing

[01:17:33:22 - 01:17:37:23]
Speaker 1
 you think that the descriptors do that i mean

[01:17:39:16 - 01:17:43:22]
Speaker 1
 what kind of question is that and he says this is the content that

[01:17:45:13 - 01:17:49:19]
Speaker 1
 does let's go what exactly let's go back a little bit

[01:17:49:19 - 01:17:58:25]
Speaker 3
 of um i think most people are getting i think most of the people are getting their information from the millions of subscriptions to freshen fit and whatever and fresh

[01:17:58:25 - 01:18:02:19]
Speaker 4
 and fit he goes on often they have a very close yeah

[01:18:02:19 - 01:18:10:18]
Speaker 1
 i he goes all right okay um doesn't mean that he's like that popular

[01:18:13:13 - 01:18:19:08]
Speaker 1
 i mean i i couldn't let his content and i've never heard of this guy either so i'm not okay

[01:18:19:08 - 01:18:21:25]
Speaker 3
 well myring gains i'm sure is much more popular than him

[01:18:21:25 - 01:18:24:01]
Speaker 1
 yeah for sure he is

[01:18:24:01 - 01:18:37:13]
Speaker 4
 yeah well the thing is is like maybe but myron gain maybe he is means is not that are you saying he's the red pill i think he's one of them okay so what so what is let's start with that what is

[01:18:37:13 - 01:18:46:09]
Speaker 1
 what kind of stupid thing was that oh you think he's the red pill of course he doesn't think he is the red pill like the one and only like that was just kind of coming

[01:18:46:09 - 01:18:51:09]
Speaker 3
 it's the red pill i consider it content that claims to reveal the truth about women but promote

[01:18:51:09 - 01:18:54:16]
Speaker 1
 content that claims to reveal the truth about women so

[01:18:56:07 - 01:18:59:24]
Speaker 1
 okay kind of describes women

[01:18:59:24 - 01:19:02:00]
Speaker 3
 what's misogyny and male victimhood

[01:19:03:02 - 01:19:05:04]
Speaker 4
 okay so and

[01:19:05:04 - 01:19:11:20]
Speaker 1
 leads to misogyny and victimhood okay and it describes them a certain way which leads to certain thing okay

[01:19:11:20 - 01:19:13:20]
Speaker 4
 um you think that the

[01:19:13:20 - 01:19:19:00]
Speaker 5
 descriptors do that i think the content creators that are prescribing what the red pill is so

[01:19:19:00 - 01:19:24:01]
Speaker 4
 it's not about so it's about content creators sure you just think that so there's just content

[01:19:24:01 - 01:19:28:02]
Speaker 1
 okay what does that matter really like

[01:19:29:23 - 01:19:38:03]
Speaker 1
 splitting between like the most popular people of the movement who all kind of go in a similar direction to do this

[01:19:40:07 - 01:20:12:01]
Speaker 1
 kind of naughty thing and he doesn't seem to dispute that part he just seems to kind of put hairs there and say oh well the the description doesn't on its own do that but the content creators that talk about it also say you know do also basically do this whole misogyny thing or whatever which doesn't seem to dispute at least not yet so uh weird okay

[01:20:12:01 - 01:20:15:06]
Speaker 4
 content creators who you disagree with their message um the

[01:20:15:06 - 01:20:19:00]
Speaker 3
 majority of the red pill content creators that disagree with their message

[01:20:19:00 - 01:20:23:05]
Speaker 4
 well okay but okay well what's the majority like how many do you think they're the most

[01:20:23:05 - 01:20:29:13]
Speaker 5
 popular of the bunch the ones that have the most viewers subscribers okay so who are these guys so you're talking about um fresh and fit is a big one

[01:20:29:13 - 01:20:32:10]
Speaker 3
 andrew tate is another one and whatever podcast is another one

[01:20:32:10 - 01:20:33:20]
Speaker 4
 fresh fit

[01:20:35:22 - 01:20:37:10]
Speaker 4
 fate do

[01:20:37:10 - 01:20:45:27]
Speaker 1
 you have to write those three down i mean i mean that kind of more obvious biggest ones

[01:20:48:00 - 01:21:01:20]
Speaker 4
 and whatever so here's an easy one i guess let's start with whatever because i'm intricate i'm pretty familiar with the content here um so what is the message that's being put out there

[01:21:01:20 - 01:21:12:03]
Speaker 3
 um there's a lot of misogynists the messages that come out of this podcast and i have several lists. Well let's start with what is misogyny? Misogyny is the hatred or dislike of women the act of dislike of women

[01:21:13:29 - 01:21:58:07]
Speaker 1
 okay uh sure uh let me guess um this is they get this on the show often where they'll have some usually women that will come in the show and be like yeah i saw some stuff from the show i saw some clips or whatnot and it seems like y'all are misogynistic misogynistic it seems like y'all are misogynistic that you don't like women um insecure things like that the common things they hear which are totally fair but then they'll try to kind of you know play super nice and be like oh we don't do this we're not like that i mean there's all these other red pill creators that might be like that but you know we're not like that we're good how how exactly are we misogynistic and

[01:22:01:08 - 01:22:27:05]
Speaker 1
 sure i mean off the top of their head they usually can't point to like a specific example um but yeah i mean the whole tone i will go into it at some point but the whole tone of the show will will do um the next time they have uh their regular kind of panel on um i think we'll get into it a little bit but she'll come up but the the whole thing

[01:22:30:04 - 01:22:30:29]
Speaker 4
 um i

[01:22:30:29 - 01:22:37:16]
Speaker 1
 just don't happen to tell him right now it would take me way too long this is already like five over almost six hours

[01:22:37:16 - 01:22:49:03]
Speaker 4
 oh women yeah correct the entire job not the active dislike of a woman no not typically so it's just women yeah okay so misogyny is the active hatred or dislike of women you got it all

[01:22:49:03 - 01:22:52:08]
Speaker 5
 right and fresh and fit is another big opener

[01:22:52:08 - 01:22:58:12]
Speaker 4
 to that let's start with whatever okay yeah so what is the misogyny or the dislike of women which is promoted on this channel

[01:22:58:12 - 01:23:04:19]
Speaker 3
 every it's presented as a dating podcast but it's really not um the topics that typically come up on this part of

[01:23:04:19 - 01:23:07:00]
Speaker 5
 that what makes it not a dating podcast i'm about to go into that

[01:23:07:00 - 01:23:15:08]
Speaker 3
 oh okay go ahead um a dating podcast should not discuss whether or not women should be submissive whether women should vote on sunday

[01:23:15:08 - 01:23:16:08]
Speaker 1
 i mean

[01:23:17:22 - 01:23:47:20]
Speaker 1
 yes or no i don't really think it's inappropriate to discuss like on a dating podcast whether or not women should be submissive um the answer to that may depend on the person but it's not irrelevant to dating um whether women vote or not on the other hand probably irrelevant yeah i mean i think it they have this common thread where it goes into this whole you know feminism women's rights thing and

[01:23:48:21 - 01:24:13:05]
Speaker 1
 i think you could make anything technically relevant to dating so on some level sure it's relevant but not really more or less than literally anything else i mean everything at some point is related so it's just one of those things that like sure you could you could link it back to it to dating somehow but does it really no not really it's it's more like politics

[01:24:15:03 - 01:24:21:18]
Speaker 3
 hey sunday show you as women how many pumps after they tell you to stop is it great that's not a dating podcast

[01:24:21:18 - 01:24:25:00]
Speaker 1
 oh that was the last okay that was the last one that's

[01:24:26:02 - 01:24:32:05]
Speaker 1
 yeah that was that was weird well we'll see if i can remember to

[01:24:34:14 - 01:24:45:28]
Speaker 1
 yeah that that was so weird so basically they were discussing like if if a man is actively um you know

[01:24:47:05 - 01:24:53:20]
Speaker 1
 having relations with women and pumps would be you know in and out

[01:24:55:02 - 01:25:06:12]
Speaker 1
 and if she says stop and he keeps going for how many in and out motions can he do that before it's considered

[01:25:07:27 - 01:25:20:20]
Speaker 1
 essay basically and they went on and on about this and i mean i sure it's related to dating but like really it's just why

[01:25:23:03 - 01:25:36:23]
Speaker 3
 gas that's one of the craziest questions i've ever heard yeah same you basically say divorce divorce hurts men marriage is pointless i don't know how that's helping your audience i don't know how military conscript

[01:25:36:23 - 01:25:39:09]
Speaker 1
 well to be fair um

[01:25:40:09 - 01:27:29:18]
Speaker 1
 andrew here did not say marriage is pointless because he has married us he likes to tat around like that's a speed defenses oh i'm married y'all are not even married and i'm married so i know better somehow even his whole the the wife and how they always you know judge other women for having multiple baby daddies and you know she does i think he's what the third allegedly so and not super traditional and them judging other women for basically what she herself has done while tatting her around is like this perfect wife and perfect woman so anti-feminist so submissive so perfect in all the ways basically just this pure picture of perfection and yeah he likes to talk about so he's definitely not anti-marriage um but the uh what was that thing oh the divorce hurts many i mean um there's there's truth to that divorce does often hurt men more um but it really depends like you know women basically if if they are a homemaker and they get divorced i mean they don't have any job history so the kid there's they can't exactly get like it had they been working that whole time climbing the corporate ladder versus dedicating themselves to the household they would have definitely you know after divorce be able to take care of themselves better um and there's definitely you know there's some some room for discussion questions in different situations there but it often is um the case that divorce hurts hurts men more um i think that may be changing a little bit but i could i could see that there being some truth to that so

[01:27:31:02 - 01:27:41:13]
Speaker 3
 inscription has anything to do with the dating podcast i don't know how uh you know guests being shown a submissive ex-girlfriend and saying would you bow to your husband okay

[01:27:41:13 - 01:28:45:07]
Speaker 1
 so um brian the host usually has this video where he pulls that he pulls out and it's it's a random video of um a young asian woman and it's like a pov where um the husband or whoever would come into the into the house to come home and she basically greets him at the door and does like a bow like phone like bow um and you know basically feed some tomatoes or something my bad and basically feed some tomatoes for dinner and she's like this perfection submissive um woman and he goes around and basically convinces women that they should be bowing to their man and if they don't it's somehow wrong and if you you know put a d in your mouth that's like so much worse than bowing and if you do that why not just bow um let's go on and about this basically every other time they have a panel of ladies on it's completely ridiculous i'm glad he brought that up because like what

[01:28:47:10 - 01:28:55:20]
Speaker 3
 and would you bow to your husband that's not a dating podcast that is promoting hatred of women and and misogyny as well um

[01:28:55:20 - 01:29:49:12]
Speaker 1
 what kind of i know like the cleaver in asian countries you know the wife would bow to the husband no they don't they've had um ladies from asian countries that the report do this and they said no they don't do that it may be like a very rare like formal occasion but no that's not like they don't just come home and like oh it's like a regular thing and they just do a bow and feed them and just like bow to the left or right that's just not in it and if you're not asian like and you don't have that culture of the bowing um rarely to your husband in the first place but if you're not even part of that part show what what does that have to do with you like what it's just ridiculous that really doesn't have anything to do with dating and i'm pretty sure it's just rage bait but it's just so they really push that

[01:29:49:12 - 01:29:56:16]
Speaker 3
 um female guests are pressured to reveal their body count and then mocked if they don't reveal they're interrogated until they reveal

[01:29:56:16 - 01:30:24:03]
Speaker 1
 yeah basically and it's it's such it's such as like a dirty tricks kind of thing because if if one refuses they keep trying to push it push this whole like oh well do you want to give her range and if if they do if they are trusting enough and don't see through this whole thing and do give a range they'll just assume it's not just the highest number but like triple whatever the highest end of the range is

[01:30:25:20 - 01:31:01:22]
Speaker 1
 they'll be like oh is it is it between you know um one and 50 and then they usually start kind of high they're like oh is it over 100 and they'll be like no and then they're start going down and down a little bit and then the woman busting realize well they'll be like oh i'm not telling you but some of them do say that it's you know between this and that and they'll just take the highest number um and if they try to argue about it it's whatever you know like the name of the show it doesn't matter they'll just assume whatever they want and go with it and assign her whatever number they they think is um the highest and

[01:31:03:08 - 01:31:17:00]
Speaker 1
 for when it comes around to their side of um the table and it's their turn to say it they of course don't so it's okay for them not to but you know the one kind of they're really pressured to it yeah

[01:31:17:00 - 01:31:26:08]
Speaker 3
 um women with only fans are moralized and told to quit um male promiscuity is excused and celebrated um

[01:31:26:08 - 01:31:34:05]
Speaker 1
 i don't really have a problem with like saying oh hey you should should quit doing only fans um but the way they do it is definitely not

[01:31:36:21 - 01:31:39:26]
Speaker 1
 yeah it's it's the way they do it it's pretty nasty

[01:31:41:13 - 01:32:10:11]
Speaker 1
 but i don't really have a problem in general with the like hey you know that's not a great path you know what why don't you do something else like that i don't and they do sometimes have conversations that are a little bit more like calm like oh why don't you do this other thing and um it's fine to ask i mean they're there to discuss this sort of thing so that's why i don't have a huge problem with that just sometimes the way they say it can be quite nasty and it's not rare

[01:32:10:11 - 01:32:20:01]
Speaker 3
 um women are asked about their peak looks age and questioned incessantly segments like man bear versus woods mock women's very real fears about

[01:32:20:01 - 01:32:38:12]
Speaker 1
 man bear versus woods okay so it's it's the whole if you're stuck a lot in the woods would you rather come across a man or a bear thing um there's like a whole internet trope about it i'm sure you've come across something like that at some point so they basically go around anyone that says i'd rather be along with the bear they're like oh ha ha you know

[01:32:39:23 - 01:32:48:22]
Speaker 1
 they don't say it quite like that but it basically boils down to while you're so stupid do you think all men are going to um say you or whatnot and

[01:32:49:22 - 01:33:02:28]
Speaker 1
 i mean sure it's not exactly logical but is it really that big of a deal that a woman would say that i mean i don't know maybe i don't think so but maybe some people might think that

[01:33:03:28 - 01:33:09:05]
Speaker 1
 um but yeah they do that basically every time is just is the whole bear thing

[01:33:09:05 - 01:33:25:16]
Speaker 3
 about male violence even though statistical realities are ignored and dismissed as irrational the super chat roast um the guests love to shit on these women there's a chance they get and on this show feminism and women are blamed for most of his problems

[01:33:25:16 - 01:33:28:18]
Speaker 1
 yeah that that's actually true

[01:33:30:16 - 01:33:38:24]
Speaker 1
 yeah like anytime anything is discussed where something goes poorly for men it's like oh it's women's fault i want feminism

[01:33:43:01 - 01:33:52:12]
Speaker 2
 and i have a do you have a copy of that i'd like to see it the thing because you just shotgunned a bunch of points and andrew might you want yeah you can have

[01:33:52:12 - 01:33:55:23]
Speaker 3
 it one by one i also have peer reviewed studies if you want those two

[01:33:55:23 - 01:34:00:05]
Speaker 4
 yeah if you have uh any especially if they have a meta analysis i'd like to see them

[01:34:00:05 - 01:34:09:21]
Speaker 2
 and and just to be before you give your response andrew my understanding here for the the debate was primarily going to be about feminism not specific criticisms of the

[01:34:09:21 - 01:34:15:01]
Speaker 1
 uh oh i mean he okay he doesn't doesn't want to hear criticism of his show

[01:34:16:07 - 01:34:19:09]
Speaker 1
 but okay i mean

[01:34:19:09 - 01:34:22:23]
Speaker 4
 well i mean this is the prompts were about man it's like

[01:34:22:23 - 01:34:30:27]
Speaker 1
 oh man if you want to take a look at feminism that'd be super nice you know don't don't hate on my show my show is like oh it's so cool don't hate it

[01:34:32:07 - 01:34:44:07]
Speaker 4
 else if you're in red pill yeah so this is i'm actually fine with this right so um why it's not a really a dating podcast so whether women should be submissive

[01:34:44:07 - 01:35:15:22]
Speaker 1
 i'm sure they're gonna have some conversation leader or a brightest and like well i said i didn't really wouldn't right not really have i said i'd rather not have this whole thing of like discussing the show i'd rather talk about this feminism thing why did you go into this whole um discussing how the show is bad thing i'd rather have done the feminism thing did you hear me say anything about that i mean i don't know but it seemed like ryan was kind of like let's talk about something else and i'm just like oh whatever i you know i got this so i do this point by point

[01:35:15:22 - 01:35:18:17]
Speaker 4
 if um why i don't

[01:35:18:17 - 01:35:24:28]
Speaker 1
 know each one of those things is totally not you know women are bad it's more like just

[01:35:26:00 - 01:35:30:29]
Speaker 1
 regular descriptions of the world and how statistics are on their side and we'll see

[01:35:30:29 - 01:35:34:09]
Speaker 4
 understand why would that not be relational to dating

[01:35:34:09 - 01:35:37:11]
Speaker 5
 what does submission have to do with dating well

[01:35:37:11 - 01:35:48:07]
Speaker 4
 because dating is uh especially on a dating show you would be significantly talking about people's preferences when it came to the the social experiences they're having with the opposite sex you're not talking about

[01:35:48:07 - 01:36:07:00]
Speaker 1
 yeah i could i could say i mean i i think i mentioned earlier but yeah i don't think like submission on its own is like not relevant to dating it's it's kind of an important part of dating and preferences about submission because it it has a lot to do with the relationship dynamics and things like that so i don't have a problem with that being like a topic of conversation

[01:36:08:14 - 01:36:12:07]
Speaker 1
 in general they don't go about it well but in general it's not a

[01:36:12:07 - 01:36:19:11]
Speaker 3
 problem talking about your preferences you're talking about their preferences because when you talk about submission you're talking about from your worldview women should be submissive

[01:36:19:11 - 01:36:33:10]
Speaker 4
 okay but what from their worldview that they could also have maybe a counter to that why they shouldn't or uh also a lot of them say yes they should so the idea here for submission especially would be i don't i don't see how that's not dating related

[01:36:33:10 - 01:36:38:07]
Speaker 3
 i i don't know how submission comes up on any sort of date i don't know if you've ever been on a date in the

[01:36:38:07 - 01:36:41:13]
Speaker 4
 last 20 years okay so if i ask you what

[01:36:41:13 - 01:36:48:10]
Speaker 1
 i mean just because it doesn't come off on a date doesn't mean it's not related to dating i mean that's not a great point

[01:36:49:28 - 01:36:59:03]
Speaker 4
 type of woman do you want and you go through the traits and you say i'd also like a submissive woman does that make sense to say is a trait

[01:36:59:03 - 01:37:04:10]
Speaker 3
 sure i don't know many people that would just offer that up as one of the first things they want a woman but maybe those are the people you hang

[01:37:04:10 - 01:37:23:06]
Speaker 4
 out with who said is the first if you're at five i'm asking if you ask somebody i'm asking what's your dynamic and one of the answers is a submissive woman yeah that comes up all the time for men in dating okay in your circles perhaps i mean no just in what it well how many dating podcast sample sizes do you have here i listen i

[01:37:23:06 - 01:37:28:03]
Speaker 1
 wouldn't know i mean i'm sure that the people that hangs out with probably say

[01:37:29:10 - 01:37:55:17]
Speaker 1
 bring that up often and maybe the men he talks to don't ever bring it up so i don't know if there's like a general study done of like how many men like even think about like whether women are submissive or not as part of their criteria and i'm not a man myself so i do not know but it is relevant to dating i don't see your problem with that again sure

[01:37:55:17 - 01:38:01:25]
Speaker 3
 i listen i'm on a dating podcast i made one i listened to a lot i listened to a lot of your shows i listened to a lot of everything

[01:38:01:25 - 01:38:11:09]
Speaker 4
 that's out there i don't understand any of the dating podcasts that come up when you ask men yeah their preference they've never once says i would prefer to have a woman who's more submissive

[01:38:11:09 - 01:38:14:01]
Speaker 3
 the topic of submission only comes up on red pill podcasts

[01:38:14:01 - 01:38:17:07]
Speaker 4
 no it doesn't only come up where else is it come up it's

[01:38:17:07 - 01:38:23:24]
Speaker 5
 been on dr. fill it's everywhere dr. fill talks about submission every episode every episode i didn't say every episode he's not doing

[01:38:23:24 - 01:38:26:20]
Speaker 4
 a dating is he doing a dating podcast don't mention dr.

[01:38:26:20 - 01:38:33:15]
Speaker 5
 Phil's a dating show then doing don't mention dr. Phil's a dating show that's not a dating show you asked where else it's mentioned as a dating show that

[01:38:33:15 - 01:38:42:16]
Speaker 4
 is not a dating show so in any case any of the dating podcasts that i've seen is a very common answer to say if they want to name another dating podcast and here's the other thing to dive into

[01:38:42:16 - 01:39:19:05]
Speaker 1
 i'd be curious like ago he said he's seen all these dating podcasts and it's a common thing like name some other ones like he said i'm sure he's just gonna try to skip over that but i mean i'm interested i mean i don't honestly i don't have a problem with it being a subject but um it is curious that they talk about that a lot and that is a very big deal for them um you know which it was just fine i don't mind like having a certain um a certain like category of content and be focused on one thing and another category be focused on you know another you know set of things that's fine but he kind of just kept going past that

[01:39:19:05 - 01:39:23:08]
Speaker 5
 into this name another dating podcast so to dive into this we gotta name another dating podcast

[01:39:23:08 - 01:39:30:24]
Speaker 4
 okay freshen fit happens they're all that's one of those content exactly as i said okay so we're talking about a dating podcast what do you mean by that

[01:39:30:24 - 01:39:34:06]
Speaker 3
 something a little less i don't know misogynistic perhaps what does that

[01:39:34:06 - 01:39:49:02]
Speaker 1
 yeah i mean naming one of the three that he said in the beginning are um you know red pill misogynistic um as like another podcast i just happened to talk about submissive uh women um i mean that that was silly for him okay

[01:39:49:02 - 01:39:51:27]
Speaker 3
 that mean though i've already explained it to you

[01:39:51:27 - 01:39:57:11]
Speaker 4
 and if any man has it it has a dating podcast is it uh red pill i have a dating

[01:39:57:11 - 01:40:00:00]
Speaker 5
 podcast and it's not misogynistic i see and let me

[01:40:00:00 - 01:40:02:23]
Speaker 4
 ask you a question what kind of questions you ask in your dating podcast i

[01:40:02:23 - 01:40:07:10]
Speaker 3
 ask them what are their priorities in a man i ask them do you have advice for men and

[01:40:07:10 - 01:40:09:10]
Speaker 4
 how many how many men have you had on

[01:40:09:10 - 01:40:17:12]
Speaker 5
 zeros called women on men oh i see so you're a misandrist absolutely not well i don't understand why don't you want a man's opinion because i want to ask women specifically

[01:40:17:12 - 01:40:20:10]
Speaker 3
 that's nothing misandry involves hate i don't hate men

[01:40:20:10 - 01:40:34:06]
Speaker 4
 oh okay i got it so so you only have on women correct and you don't ask them when you ask them about preferences yeah right that do they say that they want things like assertive men no do they say that they want less assertive men

[01:40:34:06 - 01:40:38:22]
Speaker 3
 i give them a list of 10 traits and say rank these between your top three and your bottom three

[01:40:38:22 - 01:40:41:24]
Speaker 4
 okay so you're you're getting a lot of what's on that list

[01:40:41:24 - 01:40:45:25]
Speaker 3
 giving them the answers i'm not giving them the answers they take a lot of time to think about

[01:40:45:25 - 01:41:02:23]
Speaker 1
 i didn't say given the answers i mean 10 is already a lot of traits i mean if i were just to think about like traits that i personally would want in a man i don't know if i could even think of 10 that are like unique enough to separate out like that um

[01:41:05:05 - 01:41:23:09]
Speaker 1
 yeah i mean that's that's already quite a few i don't know how that's giving them the answers i mean kind of but it helps to have something that's a little bit organized where um you you can kind of quantify things better if it's just completely free of form um it's going to be difficult to compare answers about it

[01:41:23:09 - 01:41:25:17]
Speaker 4
 but you just said you gave them 10 traits

[01:41:25:17 - 01:41:28:12]
Speaker 3
 yeah that does not the answers those are options yeah

[01:41:28:12 - 01:41:33:22]
Speaker 4
 yeah that's the answers that are options you can choose from it's a multiple choice that's not answers yes it's

[01:41:33:22 - 01:41:36:13]
Speaker 3
 answers okay they're answers andrew yeah

[01:41:36:13 - 01:41:38:20]
Speaker 4
 you gave them 10 answers and say choose from and

[01:41:38:20 - 01:41:40:17]
Speaker 3
 then they sort them yeah but that doesn't that's

[01:41:40:17 - 01:41:43:00]
Speaker 4
 their answer they're making a choose from answers that you give

[01:41:43:00 - 01:42:35:26]
Speaker 1
 god every time he does this like smirking thing it just makes me like i'm so uncomfortable i don't know why just something about it's like smirking that he constantly does it just like uh irrelevant to what they're discussing sure but still just i mean it's just giving them give them okay so you're literally feeding them their answers and then and then they choose them yep okay i mean they're both kind of right he's not feeding them answers but there are a limited set of options that they're not to choose from so sure he is asking them to select their preferences but i mean if something wasn't on the list that really was their you know top 10 i think they probably would bring it up and talk about it maybe maybe not but

[01:42:35:26 - 01:42:41:28]
Speaker 3
 yep and they don't come and say man i wish you would have had this on well how can there

[01:42:41:28 - 01:42:47:09]
Speaker 4
 you go yeah i just hit then well how long have you been doing it can we get back to can we get

[01:42:47:09 - 01:42:56:02]
Speaker 1
 back to misogynistic podcasts yes seriously how is that i mean sure but it's really that big of a deal is the case can we get back to

[01:42:56:02 - 01:43:01:05]
Speaker 5
 misogynistic past no we're not a that it is your criticism can we get back to misogynistic if you're gonna have

[01:43:01:05 - 01:43:03:16]
Speaker 4
 criticism for whatever i'm gonna have criticism for your podcast you

[01:43:03:16 - 01:43:06:15]

[01:43:14:25 - 01:43:49:13]
Speaker 1
 you can't yeah that's not how that works you would have to you know listen to the show you can't just take like one thing that you kind of have a problem with and honestly that isn't that big of a deal and be like oh well this you know is bad because this and that you got you got to see at least you know a couple hours of it to really have like a form of opinion for this kind of discussion um to have like at least a little bit of an opinion at least watch like a few clips here and there but come on don't

[01:43:49:13 - 01:43:57:14]
Speaker 5
 watch my podcast so don't sit here we're not going to critique my podcast why not because you haven't even watched it let's watch it go ahead pull it up so if we pull your 45 minutes 45

[01:43:57:14 - 01:44:04:23]
Speaker 3
 minutes 45 minutes put on two times speed and then we can critique my podcast but until then tell me about another non-misogynistic red pill

[01:44:04:23 - 01:44:07:25]
Speaker 4
 podcast well i don't think any of those are misogynistic podcasts yeah of course not

[01:44:07:25 - 01:44:14:07]
Speaker 1
 you gotta damn are they really i don't think they're gonna watch the show but they're acting like they're going to which is hilarious straight

[01:44:14:07 - 01:44:15:13]
Speaker 4
 that they actually hate these women

[01:44:15:13 - 01:44:27:01]
Speaker 3
 by their actions by the things everything that's happening right there so so let's go through some more of these when my ring gains has a has a college uh table that says women deserve less you don't think that's a little

[01:44:27:01 - 01:44:37:00]
Speaker 5
 misogynistic is that during his podcast he is one of the red pill content creators that we're talking about to be a podcast dude i thought i had to be a podcast can

[01:44:37:00 - 01:44:39:12]
Speaker 1
 you

[01:44:44:04 - 01:44:52:17]
Speaker 3
 doesn't that be a podcast like an adult that is the most childish thing i've ever seen in my whole life you put the criteria gave me the criteria is the content creators including my ring gains

[01:44:52:17 - 01:45:01:04]
Speaker 4
 yes i've always said that nothing's changed in my statement we're talking about dating podcasts or the idea of dating correct is it also possible there's just not that many yeah

[01:45:01:04 - 01:45:07:28]
Speaker 5
 there's not a lot of red pill podcasts the no no just dating podcast there's a ton of dating podcasts okay name some mine name some other ones

[01:45:07:28 - 01:45:16:01]
Speaker 3
 um there's a guy named man we're in trouble um there's um ev edit there's ev

[01:45:16:01 - 01:45:32:27]
Speaker 4
 edits uh uh dating podcast yeah she talks about dating and men and women say that dating podcast though yes so they have this isn't a dating podcast so they have this isn't a dating podcast so on ev edit they have uh every single time they come on they have multitudes of people on with them and all they talk about

[01:45:32:27 - 01:45:35:00]
Speaker 3
 is they say they have guests i'm not talking about the form

[01:45:35:00 - 01:46:00:11]
Speaker 1
 you don't have to have like a panel of only fans girls in order to be considered a dating podcast i mean that's just the format that they want but there's many different ways to have a dating podcast you could literally be one person in a room alone and discuss dating and still be considered a dating podcast i don't see how that's

[01:46:00:11 - 01:46:05:07]
Speaker 3
 format i'm saying that's what the content that comes up is men and women and this is not a dating podcast that we're currently

[01:46:05:07 - 01:46:10:04]
Speaker 4
 on you're just talking about freaking you a dating podcast just anybody who's talking about dating

[01:46:10:04 - 01:46:14:21]
Speaker 5
 this is not a dating podcast that we're currently on we'll prove it i just

[01:46:14:21 - 01:46:22:04]
Speaker 2
 did how let's go through more you want me to read them so here why don't we do the first one whether women should be submissive i don't

[01:46:22:04 - 01:46:33:26]
Speaker 1
 i don't think the whatever podcast is not a dating podcast but it's also

[01:46:35:17 - 01:47:12:16]
Speaker 1
 not not it's not a dating podcast but it's also not not a dating podcast it's it has dating related things and it talks about dating and preferences but to describe it as like a dating podcast i mean sure you can but i wouldn't there's a lot more to it than that i wouldn't say it's like super laser focused on dating specifically it may be like 50 50 dating and whatever else

[01:47:13:24 - 01:47:23:20]
Speaker 4
 um i don't understand how again how would that not be yeah actually how would that not be uh a decent question to ask for dating i don't get it

[01:47:23:20 - 01:47:24:19]
Speaker 3
 you ask on your first dates

[01:47:24:19 - 01:47:31:16]
Speaker 4
 what if a woman would be submissive yeah no exactly because it's not a dating question why would that wait hang on let's back up

[01:47:31:16 - 01:47:42:16]
Speaker 1
 well that's again that's not relevant just because you don't ask something on a first or second or any date doesn't mean it's not really relevant to dating in general that that's not exactly a valid point

[01:47:42:16 - 01:47:50:05]
Speaker 4
 let's assume for a second that anything that i would ask a woman on the first date isn't something you would ask a woman on the first date what does that prove

[01:47:50:05 - 01:47:58:26]
Speaker 3
 i'm saying the things you guys do how do you think you're gonna look better in 10 years do you think you're gonna look better in 10 years is that something you asked on the date question what's your body count do you guys sound

[01:47:58:26 - 01:48:02:28]
Speaker 1
 the first date can you answer my question i hate it when people talk over each other like that

[01:48:02:28 - 01:48:25:13]
Speaker 4
 what's a body count on the first date before you start shot you have different questions before you start shot running questions you have different questions i'll never answer one of yours if you never answer one of mine go ahead andrew so so here here we go again what does it actually prove what does it prove that if i ask the whole sequence of different questions from you on my first date what does that prove

[01:48:25:13 - 01:48:28:24]
Speaker 3
 yeah you're not asking these questions on your first can you

[01:48:28:24 - 01:48:40:10]
Speaker 1
 answer my i mean sure it doesn't but again can you just move on it's getting kind of

[01:48:40:10 - 01:48:41:22]
Speaker 6
 a question did what

[01:48:41:22 - 01:48:48:28]
Speaker 3
 does it prove it proves that you're not asking these questions so it doesn't prove anything it does prove it what does it prove that you're not asking these kinds of questions on your

[01:48:48:28 - 01:49:06:06]
Speaker 1
 first date what is that proving yeah i mean to be fair just because you you don't ask these questions on your first date doesn't mean anything it just like okay you don't ask them on the first date but it's they're so relevant to dating in general

[01:49:07:20 - 01:49:10:12]
Speaker 5
 being outside of that it proves that these are more misogynistic questions does it

[01:49:10:12 - 01:49:21:16]
Speaker 1
 also prove i don't think that it proves that they're more misogynistic just because you don't ask them on the first date that doesn't exactly logically follow

[01:49:21:16 - 01:49:29:23]
Speaker 4
 that i don't ask any other questions other people would ask that you're not asking here i have no idea if it proves it's just so stupid dude it proves nothing

[01:49:29:23 - 01:49:35:24]
Speaker 5
 okay what does it prove what do those questions prove nothing they don't prove anything okay this

[01:49:35:24 - 01:49:36:26]
Speaker 3
 is just a pure dating

[01:49:36:26 - 01:49:42:17]
Speaker 4
 podcast dating is about your preferences anecdotes experiences yeah it's about how

[01:49:42:17 - 01:49:45:20]
Speaker 3
 many months after she says stop is grape that's a dating

[01:49:45:20 - 01:49:48:01]
Speaker 4
 do you think that when people yeah

[01:49:48:01 - 01:50:16:04]
Speaker 1
 that that was so weird that they even kept going on about that it's things like that that really like sure it's relevant to dating but i mean what kind of question is that that's that's not like in whatever he was saying in anecdotes and stories about dating like it's not that what it was that was so weird

[01:50:16:04 - 01:50:18:20]
Speaker 5
 hold on answer that question

[01:50:18:20 - 01:50:24:25]
Speaker 4
 i'll answer it i don't think you are you have to stop talking i can't answer it so stop talking okay i'll answer it

[01:50:24:25 - 01:50:27:03]
Speaker 1
 did you stop okay let's just just say it

[01:50:27:03 - 01:50:35:17]
Speaker 4
 is it the case that when you have uh you know half a dozen people who are sitting at a table and they're building a rapport with each other that they crack jokes

[01:50:35:17 - 01:50:42:06]
Speaker 1
 that was not a joke the whole pump how many pumps thing that was not a joke

[01:50:42:06 - 01:50:47:15]
Speaker 3
 i think that's a joke yeah how many pumps after a woman says stop is it grape is a joke yeah

[01:50:47:15 - 01:50:50:15]
Speaker 5
 who laughs at that uh lots of people i think i

[01:50:50:15 - 01:51:20:12]
Speaker 1
 don't i don't remember if any of them laughed when they were discussing that i never that one for quite a bit a joke is like usually kind of a few one a few lines everybody goes ha ha they move on this was like a full-on discussion and they were like debating exactly how many and why and the ramifications of it like that was not a joke to try to his face to try to play it up as a joke is just come on

[01:51:20:12 - 01:51:22:20]
Speaker 5
 think it's funny i i'm not surprised

[01:51:22:20 - 01:51:43:07]
Speaker 1
 i think he would think it's funny i mean honestly uh i i know he's like fake laughing here but he would think it's funny i'm not surprised by that it wasn't a joke at the time like during the podcast you know this guy i'm sure he would think it's funny it's funny i think you think it's funny yeah hilarious his face where do you think it's

[01:51:43:07 - 01:51:46:01]
Speaker 4
 funny it is funny because you know but do you know why it's funny what makes it funny

[01:51:46:01 - 01:51:47:28]
Speaker 5
 because you're a little misogynist no no no it's because

[01:51:49:10 - 01:51:50:11]
Speaker 4
 a feminist a

[01:51:50:11 - 01:51:53:13]
Speaker 1
 little misogynist just just just just a little

[01:51:55:05 - 01:52:02:13]
Speaker 4
 on this program uh-huh uh a few months ago i remember i saw yeah yeah so i don't so it's a callback to that it's not a callback to that yeah it's a

[01:52:02:13 - 01:52:07:03]
Speaker 5
 callback to that because that was not about stopping yeah it was about consent yeah but that was about your wife

[01:52:07:03 - 01:52:10:13]
Speaker 3
 sleeping and you banging or was sleeping that doesn't she says

[01:52:10:13 - 01:53:05:03]
Speaker 1
 yeah it was completely different thing i think they're referring back to like when andrew was talking about how like while his wife is sleeping he would like surprise her with a d in the v and how she would do it back except you know not her d in his v but you know what i mean um but yeah not relevant i don't see how exactly how that's even a callback they didn't discuss like oh haha by the way this was a callback to this thing way back then um totally different context and situation no i mean this is just such a um disingenuous way to try to explain the way um just just admit that it's like not great and move on i don't think he was even a part of that discussion so just be like i don't personally

[01:53:06:16 - 01:53:19:15]
Speaker 1
 so like i don't he wouldn't say that he's got to defend the show and you know again i'm sure that he doesn't think there's anything wrong with that kind of conversation he

[01:53:19:15 - 01:53:21:03]
Speaker 5
 says stop and you keep going is that consent

[01:53:21:03 - 01:53:27:13]
Speaker 4
 that's well the idea there is how long after is is are you violating consent that's the idea yeah that's a dating

[01:53:27:13 - 01:53:51:04]
Speaker 1
 that wasn't but i'm sure that was that was kind of the thing we're talking about last time which is not a joke of discussion but the thing about his wife the problem was potential problem they were discussing was like just the initiation of it like that was the problem not if they say stop or i mean sure that could have also been discussed but completely different situation

[01:53:51:04 - 01:53:55:13]
Speaker 3
 dating podcast topic right of course yeah of course people talk about that all the time

[01:53:55:13 - 01:54:23:28]
Speaker 4
 right do you think that in the age in this modern age where intersexual and interpersonal dynamics between men and women are so fucked up and they are fucked up and you're contributing right do you think that the idea when you have tons of people who are out there talking about consent do you have feminist academics who are talking about if two people are drunk and they have sex or actually technically raping each other they're raping each other right do you really think that these are inappropriate questions to ask during a dating podcast in madera

[01:54:27:05 - 01:54:28:05]
Speaker 7
 uh okay

[01:54:30:27 - 01:54:31:19]
Speaker 1
 why would

[01:54:34:16 - 01:55:04:23]
Speaker 1
 that this whole focus on essay is like sure relevant to dating but not i mean the way they talk about it is just more like um usually involves blaming women and saying stuff like oh well woman will like lie about it and um usually assuming like the man is innocent and the woman is somehow bad modernity

[01:55:04:23 - 01:55:15:28]
Speaker 3
 i absolutely believe it's inappropriate to say how many pumps after a woman says stop is it great yeah why is inappropriate why because it should just well how does she says stop

[01:55:15:28 - 01:55:23:14]
Speaker 5
 tell me how many i'm not going to answer that question you're not going to answer it no because it's a stupid question i don't know i think it's a fair question of course you do because you're misogynistic what's my son

[01:55:23:14 - 01:55:25:25]
Speaker 1
 i thought it was a joke

[01:55:25:25 - 01:55:31:29]
Speaker 6
 i think you think about it because that is great you're talking about great in such a hardy manner how does that just answer the question how does that

[01:55:31:29 - 01:55:35:28]
Speaker 3
 prove i hate women dude we can go down the list of things you've said

[01:55:35:28 - 01:55:39:12]
Speaker 1
 i mean it feels a little obvious but okay i mean let's

[01:55:39:12 - 01:55:46:19]
Speaker 5
 see let's go down the list out of your 5 000 debates go down the list do you like women at all love them oh you love them i

[01:55:46:19 - 01:55:50:08]
Speaker 1
 don't think he does i really don't

[01:55:50:08 - 01:55:54:26]
Speaker 4
 i'm sure yeah yeah you know you know it's so funny to talk about you know how i know do

[01:55:54:26 - 01:55:57:26]
Speaker 3
 you know i know i like her more than you the fact that you would laugh at a great

[01:55:57:26 - 01:56:00:05]
Speaker 5
 question shows that you don't like women i laugh oh

[01:56:00:05 - 01:56:05:06]
Speaker 4
 yeah it just keeps smirking uh hang on are you saying i hate men because i laugh about prison great

[01:56:05:06 - 01:56:06:18]
Speaker 3
 no you don't

[01:56:06:18 - 01:56:13:04]
Speaker 1
 i don't i would you laugh about that either like that's i mean sure there's some

[01:56:14:07 - 01:57:15:21]
Speaker 1
 it's still not really funny like i know that's more acceptable to joke about but that's disturbing i don't get it though that's a double standard you don't hate men and that's also like a common cultural like more light-hearted joke about the prison essay situation um personally i'm not a fan but it's common culturally and it is understood as a joke usually by most people in attendance of wherever the joke is said but this whole thing with the pumps and how many pumps that was not a joke again i don't know why he keeps trying to find a joke that was obviously not that had a whole thing about it and it was not said in a joking manner there was no i mean any kind of laughing that was had was more like awkward like are we really talking about this kind of like laughing oh that's so funny laughing and you don't very obvious you love

[01:57:15:21 - 01:57:24:02]
Speaker 4
 men you only care about men you only care about men you only care about men you only care about men if i make light of a man getting raped yeah you don't see that's that's fine you don't see it the same and it's not you don't see it the same

[01:57:24:02 - 01:57:31:14]
Speaker 5
 well how do i see it because you see women is so much less than prove it i'm looking for the demonstration not the assertion just watch just watch just watch these

[01:57:31:14 - 01:57:47:09]
Speaker 1
 yeah i mean sure it's easy to say on the spot you know prove it quote quote me saying all this stuff but But it's not difficult to gauge his hate for women when you just watch the show. It's his...

[01:57:48:11 - 01:57:57:10]
Speaker 1
 anything from just his tone, the things he says, the way that anytime... This is one of the easiest ways to tell.

[01:57:58:15 - 01:58:15:28]
Speaker 1
 Anytime that a woman cries on the show, usually because he made her cry, he will keep egging it on and being like, "Oh, keep crying. You should cry. You should feel bad. Just keep making the woman feel worse and worse and worse." It's like he gets off a woman crying. It's really disturbing, actually.

[01:58:17:19 - 01:58:23:03]
Speaker 1
 But yeah, it's not hard. If you're any normal person and you're not stuck in the whole,

[01:58:24:06 - 01:58:37:10]
Speaker 1
 "Women are bad, I am an insult, life is so terrible because feminism..." If you're not stuck in that kind of mindset and you're just a regular person, it's very easy to see how much he actually does not like women.

[01:58:39:19 - 01:58:44:02]
Speaker 6
 Just watch Andrew's videos. Just watch Andrew's videos. Just watch his... Yeah, exactly.

[01:58:44:02 - 01:58:46:25]
Speaker 3
 Don't prove, no evidence. Just watch... Yeah, no, I mean...

[01:58:48:03 - 01:58:56:15]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, I mean, sure, it's easy to say it like, "Give me a list of quotes." But yeah, really, it's just watching some of the stuff you could tell.

[01:58:57:20 - 01:58:59:05]
Speaker 1
 I'm making it up.

[01:58:59:05 - 01:59:01:08]
Speaker 4
 So just tell me real quick.

[01:59:02:21 - 01:59:13:16]
Speaker 4
 How can you affirm that I hate women because I might make light of a grape joke for women, but I don't hate men if I make light of a grape joke for men? I'm not sure. No, you're not sure. Because that makes...

[01:59:13:16 - 01:59:21:00]
Speaker 1
 That's not entirely relevant. I mean, he didn't really say that he doesn't hate men. I mean, it's also possible that he hates men.

[01:59:22:10 - 01:59:24:26]
Speaker 1
 You can't hate both men and women.

[01:59:26:21 - 01:59:35:23]
Speaker 1
 It's not completely impossible. But yeah, I mean, also different things, different contexts. Again, not a joke. I'm getting a dead horse here.

[01:59:37:10 - 01:59:40:14]
Speaker 4
 That makes no fucking sense. So moving on to the next one,

[01:59:42:00 - 02:00:11:08]
Speaker 4
 as we go through this, whether women should vote. So in modernity, women's voting habits have a lot to do with the modern state of society, don't they? Sure. And they have to do with the state of people who want maybe patriarchy, or they want highly religious women who allow men to lead, or women who will turn over their ability to vote to their own husband and say, "You just tell me where to vote." You agree with all of that?

[02:00:12:17 - 02:00:20:10]
Speaker 4
 Sure. Okay. So then why wouldn't it be pertinent to ask women what they think about women's voting patterns and voting habits? Because you...

[02:00:20:10 - 02:00:32:20]
Speaker 1
 Ask women about women's voting patterns and habits specifically. I mean, surely mention it, but it's more in the context of should women even be allowed to vote versus just generally how women vote and what's going on there.

[02:00:33:21 - 02:00:35:15]
Speaker 1
 Should they be allowed to at all?

[02:00:35:15 - 02:00:45:28]
Speaker 3
 You talk about revoking the right for women to vote. Exactly. So it's just an easy conversation that people have. Should women vote? That's just something that people talk about around their dinner table, right?

[02:00:45:28 - 02:01:19:26]
Speaker 4
 Okay. Do you think that was an easy conversation when you were talking about whether or not it was okay for white women to vote to date black men? I think what was an easy conversation? That conversation. Sure. Pre-miscegenation was a pretty hard conversation, right? Sure, yeah. But do you think that it was pertinent to dating at the time? Sure. Okay. So then if that was pertinent to dating at the time and they were talking about all the reasons you should or shouldn't do this... The danger of it. And it's a political ideology. The danger of it. Yeah. On both sides, right? Why is it not appropriate for us to have a conversation about women's voting patterns when it comes to relationship?

[02:01:19:26 - 02:01:22:24]
Speaker 1
 Again, not voting patterns.

[02:01:24:11 - 02:01:35:02]
Speaker 1
 It's really trying to downplay exactly what they talk about. It's not women's voting patterns. It's should women be allowed to vote? Totally different thing.

[02:01:35:02 - 02:01:40:26]
Speaker 3
 It's not women's voting patterns. It's should women vote. That's not about patterns. Yeah, it is.

[02:01:40:26 - 02:01:43:28]
Speaker 5
 That is the question about women voting. How would you determine if they should or shouldn't?

[02:01:45:02 - 02:01:47:22]
Speaker 5
 I just think everyone should. Is it actually that? Oh, you just think that. Yeah.

[02:01:49:01 - 02:01:57:02]
Speaker 4
 You don't need to. You don't need to? No. Okay. I love it. So the thing is, I'll just release you from this. I'll just let you skip out.

[02:01:57:02 - 02:02:04:27]
Speaker 1
 Oh, thank you. Release him. He should be so grateful. I'm so much better than you kind of thing. It's just...

[02:02:07:17 - 02:02:10:07]
Speaker 4
 On giving me no justification for why everybody should be able to vote.

[02:02:10:07 - 02:02:11:23]
Speaker 6
 I don't need a justification.

[02:02:11:23 - 02:02:13:19]
Speaker 5
 But I would like to know, you don't need one?

[02:02:13:19 - 02:02:23:19]
Speaker 4
 I don't need a justification for why I think women should vote. I don't need a justification to ask a woman if she thinks other women should have the right to vote in order for me to judge whether or not she's a submissive woman or not.

[02:02:23:19 - 02:02:26:02]
Speaker 3
 Sure, but that's not a dating topic. That's really...

[02:02:26:02 - 02:02:35:28]
Speaker 1
 The only possible way you could be a submissive woman is to say that women should vote. I mean, there's no...

[02:02:37:07 - 02:02:46:19]
Speaker 1
 nothing beyond that. Nothing before that. It's basically just like, should women vote? No. Submissive.

[02:02:47:25 - 02:02:54:26]
Speaker 1
 Should women vote? Yes, definitely not submissive. I mean, it seems like submission is such a more nuanced topic than that.

[02:02:56:21 - 02:03:00:07]
Speaker 1
 And just saying should women vote or not.

[02:03:01:19 - 02:03:22:12]
Speaker 1
 I mean sure, yeah, a woman is probably submissive if she says no woman should vote, but not very many women today think that. And many are submissive by most people's standards. It's such a strange, all or nothing question.

[02:03:23:14 - 02:03:33:19]
Speaker 1
 It's not exactly... Just because you're submissive doesn't necessarily mean you have anything in women voting. There's just so many other ways to show submission.

[02:03:35:00 - 02:03:48:06]
Speaker 1
 So many other ways that they discuss on the show that women can show submission that just should they vote or not be kind of the end all and be all of it, that's not inaccurate by their own standards.

[02:03:49:23 - 02:03:51:10]
Speaker 3
 That's just you being political. If I want to judge if she's submissive.

[02:03:51:10 - 02:03:52:11]
Speaker 1
 That's just you being political.

[02:03:52:11 - 02:03:59:13]
Speaker 4
 You guys push your conservative agenda on this channel and that's what you do. Do you think that I want to live in it? Well, I do. Yeah, you do. But it's not my channel.

[02:03:59:13 - 02:04:03:24]
Speaker 3
 So just Jim Bob, I know. Because only just sits back and chills. Brian's chilling. He's eating popcorn.

[02:04:03:24 - 02:04:06:19]
Speaker 1
 No, seriously, that's so true.

[02:04:09:05 - 02:04:38:14]
Speaker 1
 Brian's really kind of just sitting there like a rage waiting and egging things on while he just has the dog dogs come out and do their whole mashing thing while Brian joins in sometimes. But he mostly just does kind of sit back with popcorn, so to speak. Oops, sorry. Sit back with popcorn, so to speak, and just kind of egg things on and just kind of do a little jab here and there.

[02:04:39:22 - 02:04:48:07]
Speaker 1
 Defend his dog dogs whenever he deems necessary, but for the most part just kind of lets them have at it.

[02:04:49:10 - 02:05:15:15]
Speaker 1
 It generally seems like I get a feeling like the whole bowing thing that he brings up is probably rage bait and most of his stances are probably a lot more mild compared to Andrew and Jim Bob guy was last week and all of the guys he brings on. I get that feeling for some reason, but it is what it is.

[02:05:15:15 - 02:05:23:25]
Speaker 4
 Are you asking questions? Yes, but I mean, I literally have made his podcast. It's a name for the problems that I'm here to represent my worldview.

[02:05:23:25 - 02:05:27:15]
Speaker 3
 I know, but it's a dating podcast and you're asking these crazy questions. They're not crazy.

[02:05:27:15 - 02:05:31:01]
Speaker 5
 They're absolutely. Should women vote is a crazy question in 2025.

[02:05:31:01 - 02:05:41:04]
Speaker 4
 Can I also ask you this? Do you think that men and women get into political arguments often? Sure. Constantly, right?

[02:05:41:04 - 02:05:54:13]
Speaker 1
 I mean, Again, just because something happens in a relationship, like anything happens in a relationship, so everything is a topic related to dating. I mean, sure, you could structure it that way, but that would include literally everything.

[02:05:55:19 - 02:06:11:22]
Speaker 1
 Like do women sometimes in a relationship and relationships go outside and go stargazing. So astronomy is super relevant to dating because they sometimes do it like, okay, like, is that anything could be that if you define it like that.

[02:06:11:22 - 02:06:15:13]
Speaker 3
 I mean, theoretically for dating somebody with the same values, you're not.

[02:06:15:13 - 02:06:21:11]
Speaker 4
 If you marry, if you marry a woman and she votes against your vote, would that create marital issues?

[02:06:22:25 - 02:06:28:03]
Speaker 3
 Maybe but I don't think you probably would have ever married that person to begin with because you don't have to say why. Probably not. You know why?

[02:06:28:03 - 02:06:32:02]
Speaker 4
 Because you asked her what she thought about the right to vote and she said, I want women to have.

[02:06:33:14 - 02:06:35:20]
Speaker 1
 I want to see how to do the faces. It's just so often.

[02:06:35:20 - 02:06:43:16]
Speaker 4
 I have the right to vote. And so you didn't fuck. I just thought, why? You can marry her. You didn't date her because she doesn't align with you politically. Does that make sense?

[02:06:43:16 - 02:06:48:08]
Speaker 3
 Do you know people that do that? Do you know people that say I won't marry this woman because she thinks she should marry

[02:06:48:08 - 02:06:52:07]
Speaker 4
 an overly assertive woman who thinks that she's going to be politically dominant?

[02:06:52:07 - 02:07:01:16]
Speaker 1
 He obviously wouldn't. I mean, he's the, he needs to be the boss, right? He's just can't handle having something to say except to get a sir.

[02:07:01:16 - 02:07:02:29]
Speaker 5
 Dominant my home.

[02:07:02:29 - 02:07:09:17]
Speaker 3
 It doesn't do about politically dominant. You said, if I ask a woman, do you think women should vote? And she says, yes, I'm not going to date that person.

[02:07:09:17 - 02:07:10:11]
Speaker 5
 And then, but hang on.

[02:07:10:11 - 02:07:11:28]
Speaker 4
 But then you ask her why.

[02:07:11:28 - 02:07:16:04]
Speaker 5
 No, I don't ask her why. I know, but if you were going to date her, you should know because I think.

[02:07:16:04 - 02:07:19:07]
Speaker 1
 I always with the fake laughing, why does he have to keep doing that so?

[02:07:19:07 - 02:07:24:07]
Speaker 4
 I mean, she should vote. I know you think that and you're not every man who lives.

[02:07:25:14 - 02:07:45:07]
Speaker 1
 Neither are you. And I think most men today probably think women should vote. I mean, at least here in the US, I'm sure there's some other countries that that might not be the case. But probably most of the world at this point thinks that women should vote.

[02:07:47:04 - 02:07:54:00]
Speaker 1
 Definitely most of the Western world. I don't know why he's like, I think so smug about it. Like he's this, you know,

[02:07:55:02 - 02:08:10:25]
Speaker 1
 out there all by himself and doesn't really think it's relevant. And to him, it's like this and he'll be all this like defining characteristic of submission and that all men just really care about this issue of women voting.

[02:08:12:02 - 02:08:27:15]
Speaker 1
 I just don't think I think it's the opposite. I think, you know, this guy over here is the one that's kind of the outcast and his opinion is more of a majority.

[02:08:31:04 - 02:08:34:29]
Speaker 1
 See what happened there.

[02:08:43:15 - 02:08:48:06]
Speaker 4
 Davis, I wouldn't use in terms of.

[02:09:01:23 - 02:09:09:22]
Speaker 4
 Let's go back and be getting married at the same rates to those men. Okay, well, why aren't they getting married then? Because they don't have access to those men. Okay. Can you tell me why that's wrong?

[02:09:10:24 - 02:09:13:29]
Speaker 4
 No, I think no, you can't can you? Because it makes sense, doesn't it? I'm about to.

[02:09:13:29 - 02:09:15:13]
Speaker 3
 Why do you think there's such a gulf?

[02:09:15:13 - 02:09:17:00]
Speaker 1
 Again, no, it makes sense.

[02:09:17:00 - 02:09:20:10]
Speaker 3
 Okay, here it is. Between relationships right now that you actually encourage.

[02:09:20:10 - 02:09:25:29]
Speaker 1
 So he's, he's claiming that Andrew's encouraging a gulf between relationships.

[02:09:25:29 - 02:09:30:18]
Speaker 5
 I don't what gulf do I encourage? You encouraged him on Pearl Davis's show just this week. What?

[02:09:30:18 - 02:09:33:20]
Speaker 3
 That the gulf, she said men and women aren't dating. You said good.

[02:09:33:20 - 02:09:36:11]
Speaker 1
 Men and women aren't dating. He said good.

[02:09:57:07 - 02:09:57:18]
Speaker 1
 Let's see if we can find that.

[02:10:00:00 - 02:10:07:12]
Speaker 1
 Let's see which LGBT says about it. Let's see if we can find a timestamp there.

[02:10:09:05 - 02:10:17:23]
Speaker 1
 How about 42 minutes in.

[02:10:20:22 - 02:10:22:14]
Speaker 1
 Let's see if we can find that here.

[02:10:29:01 - 02:10:31:28]
Speaker 1
 Let's see, what's going on here? Gen X. Okay.

[02:10:31:28 - 02:10:42:12]
Speaker 4
 And they weren't the worst degenerates ever. They became much more socially conservative than people thought. Gen Z on the other hand, and millennials, especially, but millennials became a bunch of leftist scumbags. But Gen Z.

[02:10:43:25 - 02:10:45:10]
Speaker 1
 Millennials are a bunch of leftist scumbags.

[02:10:47:08 - 02:11:06:05]
Speaker 1
 I mean, yeah, I do get the feeling that millennials are quite leftist. I wouldn't phrase it like that. I mean, that's just rude as somebody who is not a leftist myself. I'm still just not a fan of saying it like that. That's just lame.

[02:11:08:15 - 02:11:14:25]
Speaker 4
 Moving the paradigm back a little bit. It's very possible that Generation Alpha is finally the first generation of actual alphas.

[02:11:14:25 - 02:11:20:01]
Speaker 1
 I don't know what alpha is going to be like. There's still children, aren't they?

[02:11:22:02 - 02:11:23:11]
Speaker 4
 Right. It's possible.

[02:11:23:11 - 02:11:27:07]
Speaker 6
 I mean, I just see the sexes going further and further apart.

[02:11:27:07 - 02:11:41:10]
Speaker 1
 Here it is. So Pearl says she sees something further and further apart. And I see. He said good. Yep. There it is. You can see it in the closed caption. He says he said good. Okay. So that did happen. What? What that other guy claimed on the show.

[02:11:41:10 - 02:11:44:17]
Speaker 4
 That's a good thing. I want that. I want the division.

[02:11:44:17 - 02:11:45:17]
Speaker 6
 I thought you wanted the families.

[02:11:45:17 - 02:11:47:24]
Speaker 4
 I do want the families, but the idea of this.

[02:11:47:24 - 02:11:52:02]
Speaker 1
 Okay. So he wants the division, but he also wants the family. So let's see what.

[02:11:52:02 - 02:12:04:11]
Speaker 4
 The next thing is being far apart is saying that we both have gender roles and those gender roles. I'm not going to settle for less than that gender role and neither are you. And it's like, so one's going to have to break and it's going to be women first.

[02:12:07:01 - 02:12:11:15]
Speaker 1
 Okay. So he wants them further apart.

[02:12:13:09 - 02:12:18:20]
Speaker 1
 One of them is going to have to break and it's going to be women. I mean, why does it have to be? Yeah. I mean, that's not.

[02:12:20:00 - 02:12:29:00]
Speaker 1
 That doesn't sound like he wants, you know, men and women to come together and be, you know, friendly and relate to each other. It's like, good, you know, they should be far apart. I mean,

[02:12:30:04 - 02:12:52:01]
Speaker 1
 you kind of make an argument here that he's talking about like gender roles specifically, but when he, I mean, in response to what Pearl was saying and the way that he's saying it and how, you know, this first year, how, you know, one is going to have to break and it's going to be women.

[02:12:52:01 - 02:12:54:07]
Speaker 4
 Why does it have to be? First, because they need men. Men don't need them.

[02:12:54:07 - 02:13:28:07]
Speaker 1
 Yeah. Men don't need them. Okay. I mean, this, this kind of rhetoric here that's definitely not conducive to like men and women should come together and get along and, you know, get into relationships. This is definitely like, you know, men don't need women. They're just kind of extra women are going to break. They need us. That's so, that's so dirty. Like, but this is, I mean, do you not hear yourself? Like you don't need,

[02:13:30:07 - 02:13:36:11]
Speaker 1
 you don't need women, you know, women need you, but you're just so above all that, you know,

[02:13:38:18 - 02:13:52:11]
Speaker 1
 you're just, you're just like a woman, whatever, but they're going to break because the women, they need us. Yeah. I mean, I guess they're kind of see how this is not conducive to healthy relationships

[02:13:53:11 - 02:14:02:05]
Speaker 1
 between men and women. This is definitely just like putting them against each other, saying, we're going to break. They don't, you know, men don't need them. That's not great.

[02:14:05:01 - 02:14:09:28]
Speaker 5
 Yeah. No, no, no, no. Are you serious? Yeah. You're going to lie right here, right in front of my face.

[02:14:09:28 - 02:14:13:18]
Speaker 4
 No, I don't think I did say that. Yes, you did. You said it's good because they're going to know.

[02:14:13:18 - 02:14:19:10]
Speaker 3
 I'll tell you what you said. You said they're going to hold out because you think women are going to cave first so that we could start creating these generals again.

[02:14:19:10 - 02:14:21:23]
Speaker 1
 Ah, that is kind of what he said.

[02:14:21:23 - 02:14:25:10]
Speaker 4
 Yeah. Yes. So you're talking about my internal critique of Pearl Davis.

[02:14:25:10 - 02:14:28:18]
Speaker 3
 Pearl Davis said men and women aren't dating and you said good. And this is why.

[02:14:30:21 - 02:14:33:10]
Speaker 1
 Again, with internal critiquing. Let's see how that relates exactly.

[02:14:34:12 - 02:14:36:13]
Speaker 1
 So according to Chad J.B.C.,

[02:14:38:05 - 02:15:14:26]
Speaker 1
 he said that no, Andrew is lying that, you know, it's good that there's division and, you know, that whole thing we just discussed. It's not an internal critique of Pearl's position. It's a straightforward disagreement. What internal critique means. Internal critique accepts your own stated premises or value framework and then shows a contradiction or unintended consequence from inside that framework. So you say you value free speech. So while you try to censor X, that kind of thing, that's an internal critique.

[02:15:16:19 - 02:15:30:09]
Speaker 1
 But what happens really is Pearl says the sex is going further and further apart is negative, not good. And then Andrew is like, no, it is good. Good. I want the division and blah, blah, blah.

[02:15:31:11 - 02:15:52:07]
Speaker 1
 So he doesn't actually agree with her premise and then it's like, oh, so you think this, but hey, so why is it actually that, you know, that he just says, no, I disagree with it. So in order for that to be an internal critique, apparently it would have to be more like,

[02:15:53:23 - 02:16:24:01]
Speaker 1
 yes, the sex is going further and further apart is a negative trend. But why, you know, is this a thing? But he says just flat out no, that it's a positive trend. So it's just apparently not even an internal critique, which is interesting. Like I don't generally use kind of complicated like philosophy debate kind of words if I don't know what they mean. And I'm not even a debater really. I just like watching them.

[02:16:25:12 - 02:16:40:23]
Speaker 1
 And especially, you know, really like specific phrases like this. I just try to avoid them if I don't know exactly what it is and if I'm not sure that most people also know exactly what it is.

[02:16:41:23 - 02:17:04:03]
Speaker 1
 And especially in kind of a conversation like this, it's less of like a formal debate for other people who are big fans of debate. It's more of just like a very public popular channel where just kind of anybody, but mostly men go to kind of vent their anger at women. But really just anybody, you know, I'm not one of them. I find it kind of like a hate watching sort of thing for fun.

[02:17:06:05 - 02:17:09:28]
Speaker 1
 But yeah, I mean, that's not what that is. So okay.

[02:17:12:07 - 02:17:20:06]
Speaker 4
 This is why it's good. That's not an internal critique. Yes, it was the entire conversation with like he's saying this is yeah. Well, it's an internal critique that specific.

[02:17:20:06 - 02:17:25:08]
Speaker 1
 How is that the entire conversation? That's just not looks like it's just not the case.

[02:17:25:08 - 02:17:27:12]
Speaker 3
 The conversation was not an internal.

[02:17:27:12 - 02:17:29:07]
Speaker 5
 The whole conversation was an internal critic.

[02:17:29:07 - 02:17:30:25]
Speaker 3
 That's a very likely story.

[02:17:30:25 - 02:17:38:11]
Speaker 4
 It's not that makes no sense. Only a like. Listen, do you do am I do I am I a person who debates utilizing internal critiques? Sure.

[02:17:38:11 - 02:17:58:19]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, I would agree. I would agree with that. So based on what we just learned about, at least I learned about what internal critique means. Like, oh, you say you value this. So why are you trying to do this? And this thing would be like contradictory to what they say they value. So yeah, he does that a lot. So I don't disagree with that. But in this case, it just seems like that was just not true.

[02:17:58:19 - 02:17:59:24]
Speaker 4
 Yeah.

[02:17:59:24 - 02:18:16:06]
Speaker 1
 And do I say this whole conversation was that like, that's just silly. Like what? No, it wasn't. It was just basically a regular conversation like earlier podcasts. It wasn't even really a debate. It's just a regular podcast with like some disagreement. Okay.

[02:18:16:06 - 02:18:17:10]
Speaker 4
 Big deal.

[02:18:18:29 - 02:18:29:03]
Speaker 4
 Use that. Yeah. Do I have a staple for utilizing internal critiques? Sure. Okay. Why is it though that for some reason you think with Pearl Davis, I wouldn't use internal critiques throughout the, I will admit throughout the.

[02:18:29:03 - 02:18:33:22]
Speaker 1
 Okay. Just because you do something a lot doesn't mean you do it literally all the time. I mean, what kind of logic is that

[02:18:33:22 - 02:18:36:16]
Speaker 3
 arc as you were, but this specific point, you weren't.

[02:18:36:16 - 02:18:38:16]
Speaker 6
 This was, this was your own personal belief.

[02:18:38:16 - 02:18:42:08]
Speaker 3
 That is a good thing that men and women are dating because you only want Christian people dating.

[02:18:42:08 - 02:18:42:17]
Speaker 4
 No, no, no.

[02:18:42:17 - 02:18:46:15]
Speaker 3
 You only want Christian people dating and having babies, circulars, my point, my point there.

[02:18:46:15 - 02:18:51:06]
Speaker 1
 I don't know if he's specifically said that. He could have, I just haven't seen that part.

[02:18:52:08 - 02:18:58:10]
Speaker 1
 Well, he didn't seem to be part of like his specific point right then and there, but I wouldn't be surprised if he said stuff like that.

[02:18:59:15 - 02:19:11:10]
Speaker 4
 Now this is off the top of my head, right? And I think it's unfair for you to hold me to the standard of this debate that I had that went on for hours. I can't remember every detail of it. But if I remember this correctly, again, it wasn't really a debate

[02:19:11:10 - 02:19:14:05]
Speaker 1
 and I was pretty long.

[02:19:15:12 - 02:19:25:11]
Speaker 1
 And now I'm 45. Okay. That's not exactly what on for hours. I mean, this one is going on for hours and you could say this is more a debate. Um, this conversation here,

[02:19:26:28 - 02:19:36:28]
Speaker 1
 really how does Troyer that's well, Pearl, you get an attention. That's what you learned.

[02:19:38:11 - 02:19:50:13]
Speaker 4
 Correctly. What actually happened there was we were discussing secular marriage. And if the golf got too wide, right, then people are going to divert themselves over to other X thing. But I don't remember.

[02:19:50:13 - 02:19:51:14]
Speaker 5
 It had nothing to do with secular.

[02:19:51:14 - 02:19:57:01]
Speaker 3
 It's like you keep throwing that word in front of what these people are saying because it just helps your argument. But that's not what you guys were discussing.

[02:19:57:01 - 02:19:58:18]
Speaker 6
 I don't remember women and women aren't dating.

[02:19:58:18 - 02:20:01:19]
Speaker 3
 You admit that women and women are dating currently that it's,

[02:20:01:19 - 02:20:07:09]
Speaker 1
 you know, that part wasn't about like religion or not religion. So it was just a very general statement.

[02:20:08:10 - 02:20:11:19]
Speaker 3
 18 to 2,400 rascal women out in real life. Did you know that? Yeah.

[02:20:11:19 - 02:20:13:26]
Speaker 4
 So well, no, that's not correct. Okay.

[02:20:13:26 - 02:20:14:19]
Speaker 3
 Correct me then.

[02:20:14:19 - 02:20:18:09]
Speaker 4
 Yeah. No, show me. Show me. Show me any data that shows that in your packet.

[02:20:18:09 - 02:20:23:03]
Speaker 5
 It's probably not in that packet. Because it's not true. Okay. Then what's the, what's the statistics? I don't have to give you a counter.

[02:20:23:03 - 02:20:25:06]
Speaker 4
 I just can tell you that that's not true unless.

[02:20:25:06 - 02:20:26:19]
Speaker 1
 Okay. I mean,

[02:20:27:21 - 02:20:52:22]
Speaker 1
 there is such a thing as, you know, if you assert something, you have to present, you have to be the one that presents the evidence. Like if you're the one that says, you know, you know, the thing X is, you know, X, Y, Z. That's if you say something like, oh, think X is equal to one, two, three. You have to be the one to present evidence for that. Like the, the burden of proof is on whoever's doing the assertion.

[02:20:53:29 - 02:20:59:06]
Speaker 1
 But in this case, I mean, he wasn't like, show me the evidence.

[02:21:00:19 - 02:21:05:08]
Speaker 1
 He was just like, no, that's not true. So now he's making an assertion of,

[02:21:06:13 - 02:21:28:07]
Speaker 1
 you know, you're wrong. It's actually something else. So now he also has to show the something else. But not only does he not like have evidence that he's lying or wrong or whatever. He also doesn't even know what the something else is. So not exactly that situation.

[02:21:30:11 - 02:21:32:13]
Speaker 4
 Unless you demonstrate, demonstrate it.

[02:21:32:13 - 02:21:34:10]
Speaker 3
 Okay. I'm the one who actually brought something.

[02:21:34:10 - 02:21:37:22]
Speaker 6
 Did you bring any, did you bring anything? Demonstrate any statistic you've thrown out.

[02:21:37:22 - 02:21:52:13]
Speaker 1
 Seriously, that's, that's, I could, I could kind of sense how he's a little frustrated here because, you know, he's actually brought some things and, you know, came a little bit prepared. And he's just kind of, you know, using, using his notes, you know,

[02:21:53:28 - 02:21:59:29]
Speaker 1
 and then complaints that he doesn't have like one specific thing and it makes a big deal out of it. So that's like, that's a really, that's a really good thing to do. So that's why I thought he was a little, a little silly.

[02:21:59:29 - 02:22:02:22]
Speaker 4
 Well, now what, through what statistic have I thrown out?

[02:22:02:22 - 02:22:04:09]
Speaker 5
 Demonstrate any statistic you want out.

[02:22:04:09 - 02:22:09:13]
Speaker 6
 How much more men in college make than their, their wife. You demanded that I give you

[02:22:09:13 - 02:22:11:11]
Speaker 4
 a number. What did I say?

[02:22:12:11 - 02:22:13:16]
Speaker 4
 You said is significant.

[02:22:13:16 - 02:22:17:23]
Speaker 5
 I said, I don't actually know other than it's significant. Well, then show me the proof of that.

[02:22:17:23 - 02:22:19:01]
Speaker 4
 Yeah. I don't. That's all.

[02:22:19:01 - 02:22:23:22]
Speaker 1
 Seriously. Like, yeah. I mean, you could, you could push this either way. Not that I was going to have everything on the spot.

[02:22:27:22 - 02:22:33:09]
Speaker 4
 Okay, so here here just real quick Just demonstrate it demonstrate it.

[02:22:33:09 - 02:22:36:20]
Speaker 5
 I got your data packet. Let me ask you something our men and women dating less

[02:22:36:20 - 02:22:40:01]
Speaker 2
 Hold on if you got to answer his question.

[02:22:40:01 - 02:22:45:05]
Speaker 1
 I don't have to do it What okay? He's gotta come in here and defend his buddy. I am

[02:22:45:05 - 02:22:51:19]
Speaker 2
 Questions If you're gonna cross examine him he's gonna cross I asked him initially

[02:22:51:19 - 02:22:53:04]
Speaker 3
 how many people are dating and then so

[02:22:53:04 - 02:23:01:18]
Speaker 2
 what most of your Was the question he said you've asked a bunch of you've shotgunned a bunch of questions he asked you a question back You should respond. Oh my god this

[02:23:01:18 - 02:23:04:18]
Speaker 1
 so he doesn't have to answer He just asked a question back

[02:23:04:18 - 02:23:10:04]
Speaker 4
 fucking room is cooking. Can you open that door up? It is pretty hot in here Yeah, it's fucking cook for them. Holy shit

[02:23:11:05 - 02:23:14:28]
Speaker 4
 Whoo This is like peak bad dude

[02:23:16:07 - 02:23:21:26]
Speaker 4
 Alright, it's got to be like a fucking hundred-degree. It's hot room dude So anyway, where were we?

[02:23:23:06 - 02:23:25:19]
Speaker 1
 Was he just like thinking of how to answer what's going on here?

[02:23:26:22 - 02:23:33:19]
Speaker 3
 What are we talking about? I asked about men and women dating and the gulf between them Yeah, what about it? Do you admit that that's happening?

[02:23:35:09 - 02:23:41:19]
Speaker 4
 That there's a gulf between dating. Yeah, the men and women are dating less by general. What does that mean? What are you asking me?

[02:23:41:19 - 02:23:48:25]
Speaker 1
 Putting me what is he asking you are women and men dating less internal? I mean, that's a pretty straightforward question Do

[02:23:48:25 - 02:23:52:04]
Speaker 3
 you think men and women are dating less yes or no?

[02:23:52:04 - 02:23:54:18]
Speaker 1
 Yes, okay, and

[02:23:54:18 - 02:23:56:00]
Speaker 3
 you think that's a good thing?

[02:23:58:15 - 02:23:59:28]
Speaker 4
 Contextually it could be a good thing.

[02:23:59:28 - 02:24:13:10]
Speaker 1
 He was pretty clear that that's a good thing when he was talking to her all those Very not contextual. It was very in general. It is he was very clear about that. So no, it's Got some nuance to it all of a sudden What

[02:24:13:10 - 02:24:15:06]
Speaker 3
 do you mean by contextually

[02:24:15:06 - 02:24:29:06]
Speaker 4
 well It could be that people are selecting for better better mates for instance And so they're dating less because they have much more criteria for them to go off of maybe it You could possibly see these results of that less single motherhood there could it could be a good thing Do

[02:24:29:06 - 02:24:32:05]
Speaker 3
 you think there are more in? voluntary celibate men than ever

[02:24:33:07 - 02:24:40:11]
Speaker 3
 No, you think this is definitely not you think this is not an anomaly that's happening right now No, when it when else in history Do you think that was how

[02:24:40:11 - 02:24:48:11]
Speaker 4
 throughout most of history only about 40% of men ever reproduced? And we know this because of we can we can check our ancestry and see

[02:24:48:11 - 02:24:49:12]
Speaker 1
 I mean

[02:24:50:20 - 02:25:02:11]
Speaker 1
 Reproduce doesn't necessarily mean They weren't doing it at all. I Mean, it's definitely a correlation there e how many that doesn't necessarily mean they weren't doing it at all

[02:25:02:11 - 02:25:13:01]
Speaker 4
 or Female ancestors the male we have so yeah most men were not able to reproduce they were expendable They were used as soldiers used as this uses that So no actually

[02:25:13:01 - 02:25:16:08]
Speaker 3
 more men or so the report I can get I can get my I could see that yeah You're

[02:25:16:08 - 02:25:20:15]
Speaker 1
 also not really talking about like, you know thousands of years ago. It's not really relevant

[02:25:20:15 - 02:25:23:28]
Speaker 4
 See that point right? Yeah. Yeah. I don't think that this is like

[02:25:23:28 - 02:25:28:10]
Speaker 3
 so you don't think there's a golf in the mail loneliness Thing you don't think that's a real thing.

[02:25:28:10 - 02:25:31:07]
Speaker 4
 Yeah. Well, I didn't say that though. What did I actually say?

[02:25:31:07 - 02:25:32:01]
Speaker 3
 No, I'm asking Do

[02:25:32:01 - 02:25:48:22]
Speaker 4
 you think so what I actually said was I do I do think it is the case that no you are incorrect And that this is not the worst it's ever been I would say that the interpersonal sexual dynamics might be the worst They've ever been but I also think that feminism and single mom caused that

[02:25:48:22 - 02:26:02:24]
Speaker 1
 It's feminism's fault in single moms. He married a single mom so what's What is he blaming single moms for I guess he doesn't care about Living his wife. I mean, it's fine

[02:26:04:12 - 02:26:06:12]
Speaker 5
 That's an interesting why do you think that caused it

[02:26:06:12 - 02:26:20:17]
Speaker 4
 because all the stats show that Every single rate that you can imagine a metric which is horrific on young men Usually comes from single mother homes. We're talking everything from homelessness on up I'm almost

[02:26:20:17 - 02:26:29:00]
Speaker 1
 so I mean, I guess you could argue that oh, she was a single mom, but he came in and saved her So she doesn't have to be a single mom anymore I guess you could argue that

[02:26:29:00 - 02:26:32:05]
Speaker 3
 everything is another term for single mother homes fatherless homes.

[02:26:32:05 - 02:26:33:01]
Speaker 1
 Sure

[02:26:35:10 - 02:26:37:04]
Speaker 1
 Let's that's another way to rephrase it

[02:26:37:04 - 02:26:43:16]
Speaker 4
 So why do you put it on women? Because it's usually women who initiate being in the fatherless relationship not men and why do they

[02:26:43:16 - 02:26:44:28]
Speaker 3
 initiate being a fatherless relationship?

[02:26:44:28 - 02:27:34:13]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, I mean sure, you could be Technically the one to initiate something but if you have really good reason Did you really initiate like it? It it's kind of semantics here because you know who broke up with who if if say You know partner a cheater and partner B Did and then partner B broke up with partner a but partner a was the one that cheated, you know who really? Ended their relationship. I mean if you get technical and say, you know partner B But who was really like the reason for it partner a right? So just because there's something on paper that says, you know women, you know file for divorce more or whatever it is It doesn't necessarily mean that you know, they're just like willy-nilly. Oh, you know, I don't like doing this anymore Which I'm sure that happens, but that doesn't necessarily mean that

[02:27:35:14 - 02:27:40:07]
Speaker 4
 the number one answer from women is that irreconcilable differences so

[02:27:40:07 - 02:27:43:18]
Speaker 1
 is a vague answer for from anything

[02:27:44:28 - 02:27:56:15]
Speaker 1
 Like he cheated on me I got beat he likes ice cream and pistachio flavor and I like it in chocolate like That doesn't prove this point

[02:27:56:15 - 02:28:06:09]
Speaker 3
 So do you know anyone in a woman in your life has ever been divorced? Sure, do they say hey we got divorced because we couldn't reconcile our differences or they say another reason?

[02:28:06:09 - 02:28:13:10]
Speaker 1
 exactly, I mean that's down but Really? It's yeah, that's a good point

[02:28:14:10 - 02:28:17:09]
Speaker 4
 Usually well, I mean they they have all sorts of reasons.

[02:28:17:09 - 02:28:26:18]
Speaker 5
 Yeah, but they don't say we couldn't reconcile our differences, right? Yeah Yeah, that's true. Well, what's your point? Why do you use that as a reason women are that's the reason they give is irreconcilable

[02:28:26:18 - 02:28:37:23]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, I mean if just because that's what's on the paperwork That's like the part of probably like a multiple-choice answer when by his you know

[02:28:39:26 - 02:28:45:22]
Speaker 1
 But my histologic here if they're basically given the answer and they put it down do they really answer it

[02:28:45:22 - 02:28:52:07]
Speaker 3
 It reconciles not if that's the reason to give in court, but what do they give in real life? What's the real reason they have a

[02:28:52:07 - 02:28:53:05]
Speaker 4
 very they have a varying?

[02:28:53:05 - 02:29:12:25]
Speaker 1
 That's just like that standard kind of thing that everybody says it's not I mean, I mean, I'd be literally there like on multiple-choice paper like is it But it's just like a standard So

[02:29:12:25 - 02:29:14:20]
Speaker 3
 our differences or they say another reason

[02:29:14:20 - 02:29:19:01]
Speaker 4
 I Usually well, I mean they they have all sorts of reasons.

[02:29:19:01 - 02:29:25:11]
Speaker 5
 Yeah, but they don't say we couldn't reconcile our differences, right? Yeah Yeah, that's true. Well, what's your point? Why do you use that as a reason women?

[02:29:25:11 - 02:29:28:13]
Speaker 4
 That's the reason they give is irreconcilable.

[02:29:28:13 - 02:29:32:08]
Speaker 3
 That's not if that's the reason to give in court. What do they give in real life? What's the real reason

[02:29:32:08 - 02:29:42:23]
Speaker 4
 they have a very they have a varying a varying degree of things, but here's what's not happening What they're not actually giving in real life is he was abusing me. He was beating me up. He was doing this he was

[02:29:42:23 - 02:29:47:23]
Speaker 1
 They don't even want to bring it up or talk about it

[02:29:48:24 - 02:30:00:27]
Speaker 1
 Like don't want to get the man into trouble. They just want to like get out There's many reasons that they might not bring that up if that was happening, which does unfortunately happening a lot

[02:30:02:28 - 02:30:04:28]
Speaker 4
 Was doing that usually it's a reasons

[02:30:04:28 - 02:30:05:27]
Speaker 3
 women file for divorce

[02:30:07:01 - 02:30:12:18]
Speaker 3
 infidelity emotional neglect and poor communication followed by finances top three though. That's what the top

[02:30:12:18 - 02:30:25:01]
Speaker 5
 three I just said no, it's not Yes, it is. No. Yes. I'm three is not infidelity. Yes infidelity emotional neglect and poor communication followed by finances Oh, so what's the number one reason? I just said fidelity infidelity.

[02:30:25:01 - 02:30:31:00]
Speaker 4
 I just said infidelity is number one reason, correct? Okay, which one of these studies proves that did you bring any studies? Just tell me what don't

[02:30:31:00 - 02:30:35:10]
Speaker 3
 you know what don't say any facts for the rest of this debate if you're not gonna show me a study How about that bro?

[02:30:35:10 - 02:30:37:20]
Speaker 5
 Listen, don't show no more facts.

[02:30:37:20 - 02:30:41:11]
Speaker 2
 No more facts. Yeah, you gotta stop interrupting Did do every

[02:30:41:11 - 02:30:59:29]
Speaker 1
 really I mean He's interrupted plenty Friend always does this like anytime somebody interrupts Andrew he's just like oh you can't be interrupting Andrew or Andrew But every time intern trips everybody else which happens all the time. He just kind of lets it go You literally

[02:31:01:03 - 02:31:11:03]
Speaker 2
 Yeah, I make a claim or did you it's called yo, it's called moderating the show you've been interrupting the entire time Okay, if Andrew interrupts you I'll say the same thing. Yeah

[02:31:11:03 - 02:31:17:29]
Speaker 4
 But just real quick Did you make the claim or did I make the claim? I made the claim. Okay, great Can you show it?

[02:31:17:29 - 02:31:22:03]
Speaker 3
 I don't have the data point in front of me, but I looked it up prior to this and you can Do it after okay?

[02:31:23:03 - 02:31:27:28]
Speaker 4
 What if we do it now? Don't go for it. Sure And where can I find this data?

[02:31:27:28 - 02:31:45:11]
Speaker 3
 I Like it around now you looked it up a lot of data man. I don't know exactly each This is more about Single mothers you can look at that one if you want to talk about single motherhood

[02:31:45:11 - 02:31:53:06]
Speaker 4
 Yeah, we can get into that but again, this is just wild to me I thought I thought you were gonna tell me that that was the number one reason okay?

[02:31:53:06 - 02:31:55:11]
Speaker 3
 Well, you can't use any facts if you don't have any data

[02:31:55:11 - 02:31:57:11]
Speaker 4
 I'm seeing is lack of commitment.

[02:31:57:11 - 02:32:00:26]
Speaker 3
 Well, that's infidelity and also Okay,

[02:32:01:28 - 02:32:03:21]
Speaker 3
 what does lack of commitment mean to you Andrew?

[02:32:03:21 - 02:32:05:10]
Speaker 4
 I have no idea what it means you tell me

[02:32:05:10 - 02:32:12:03]
Speaker 3
 Right because you and fidelity doesn't show like this does infidelity show a lack of commitment So

[02:32:12:03 - 02:32:14:04]
Speaker 4
 he's not coming home by fucking 10.

[02:32:14:04 - 02:32:19:28]
Speaker 1
 Oh Yeah, I mean that's very good. Just not be finding the right

[02:32:22:19 - 02:32:32:28]
Speaker 1
 Survey or whatever however it is that they did this like I'm sure the people get different things. They could categorize things differently and They might be a little different

[02:32:32:28 - 02:32:39:13]
Speaker 4
 Okay, what are you talking about? So tell me what does that mean lack of commitment you tell me I You're the one who made

[02:32:39:13 - 02:32:47:22]
Speaker 5
 the claim. You're the one who said it was in reconcile differences That's the number one reason they filed divorces is yeah, but that's not the reason people actually file for divorce Okay,

[02:32:47:22 - 02:32:53:17]
Speaker 4
 so the reasons that they give you're saying that the number one reason women women give is infidelity

[02:32:53:17 - 02:32:55:27]
Speaker 3
 infidelity Emotional neglect and poor community.

[02:32:55:27 - 02:32:59:03]
Speaker 4
 Okay, where can I find the statistic? I don't remember man.

[02:32:59:03 - 02:33:00:19]
Speaker 1
 I put I

[02:33:15:17 - 02:33:19:19]
Speaker 1
 Tragedy what are the top three reasons women give for filing divorce?

[02:33:24:01 - 02:33:33:04]
Speaker 1
 I Just thinking

[02:33:46:01 - 02:33:47:19]
Speaker 1
 See here

[02:33:54:26 - 02:34:09:28]
Speaker 1
 Okay, it's really really thinking about it

[02:34:12:04 - 02:34:13:26]
Speaker 1
 Is Okay, so

[02:34:22:04 - 02:34:26:03]
Speaker 1
 I research service three themes dominate

[02:34:28:06 - 02:34:29:29]
Speaker 1
 First is

[02:34:31:05 - 02:34:51:06]
Speaker 1
 We've grown even paddable slash no commitment left So when we describe resistant mismatch and values long-term goals or emotional connection So this would be difficult. Sorry phrasing and share this would be what they would call basic incompatibility or lack of commitment, so this is

[02:34:52:07 - 02:34:54:23]
Speaker 1
 43 to 75 percent is

[02:34:56:12 - 02:34:57:20]
Speaker 1
 Incompatible on a commitment

[02:34:59:00 - 02:35:01:14]
Speaker 1
 Misfit values long-term goals emotional connection, etc

[02:35:02:20 - 02:35:09:12]
Speaker 1
 Second list is infidelity 28 to 59 percent list of partners affair as a primary trigger

[02:35:10:24 - 02:35:30:15]
Speaker 1
 And third is Financial stress so 22 to 46 percent To define money-related fights, so it seems like it depends on the study or survey or whatever it is That depends on like like how they categorize it, but it seems to kind of brought this together

[02:35:31:19 - 02:35:56:25]
Speaker 1
 In a way here, which is pretty handy What ties the top three together chronic not sudden movement typically endure these problems for years before filing divorces the end stage after counseling separation repeated last chance talks I mean, yeah, it's it's almost kind of a meme where the wife would drag the husband to the You know marriage counselor to work things out. That's That's almost basically a meme

[02:35:57:27 - 02:36:06:08]
Speaker 1
 Perceived irreversibility incompatibility cheating and entrenched money habits are viewed as character level issues. So I've seen a lasting change

[02:36:07:11 - 02:36:43:19]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, I mean all of these are basically like they've tried for years. It's a big problem And then better off all accommodations or is fine women with weight post-diverse stability and autonomy more heavily than men Once the emotional or financial cost benefit tips they initiate. Okay Yeah, I mean honorable mentions that rank just below the big three Emotional or physical abuse about 20 to 25 percent. That's quite a lot. That's so sad substance addiction 15 to 30 percent and constant arguing such for communication of chivalaps with reason number one Which would be gonna compatible in the commitment left

[02:36:46:21 - 02:36:53:08]
Speaker 1
 So, I guess they're probably both right, I mean there's different studies saying different things and

[02:36:55:09 - 02:36:59:21]
Speaker 1
 Just probably depends on the study which And how they group them

[02:36:59:21 - 02:37:01:04]
Speaker 3
 I brought all

[02:37:01:04 - 02:37:08:13]
Speaker 5
 the statistics you didn't bring any I didn't need to bring it Yeah, cuz you're making shit up. What am I making up anything you say cuz I can you can't pro What have

[02:37:08:13 - 02:37:09:08]
Speaker 4
 I said that I made up

[02:37:09:08 - 02:37:11:10]
Speaker 3
 about the finances that how

[02:37:11:10 - 02:37:13:01]
Speaker 4
 do I make something up when I say I don't know for sure?

[02:37:13:01 - 02:37:16:21]
Speaker 5
 Okay, well you said it's significant. That is true. It is significant. Okay.

[02:37:16:21 - 02:37:28:25]
Speaker 4
 Well, how can you prove that? Well, what does significant mean? Let's see statistically do do do do do. Let's just see if we can find this I Am NOT seeing infidelities number one answer on any of these. Okay

[02:37:28:25 - 02:37:36:12]
Speaker 1
 I Mean it's Categorized that it's number two

[02:37:36:12 - 02:37:39:00]
Speaker 4
 number one reason I'm seeing is financial problems That's

[02:37:39:00 - 02:37:41:29]
Speaker 3
 not the number one reason and you've also said it's not the number one reason.

[02:37:41:29 - 02:37:45:00]
Speaker 4
 That's what I'm seeing Okay, but I'm ready for a counterfactual.

[02:37:45:00 - 02:37:51:06]
Speaker 3
 Okay, fine. Let's just concede that I don't know what I'm talking about The point is it's not in reconcilable differences people file for a reason

[02:37:51:06 - 02:37:53:26]
Speaker 4
 well We're talking past each other because you act we were talking

[02:37:53:26 - 02:38:11:12]
Speaker 1
 well to be fair like basic And I have commitment is like irreconcilable differences But so is infidelity like that's in an irreconcilable difference and so is money infinitive stress. That's also an irreconcilable difference You know emotional physical abuse

[02:38:12:14 - 02:38:36:16]
Speaker 1
 Kind of its own category. I think but if you really wanted to you could also group it in there substance substance addiction is also Kind of its own category, but it's also an irreconcilable difference like one person wants to do with other one to sentence and They were consented a different so yeah, I mean you could you could group pretty much anything into that one category if you want to

[02:38:38:14 - 02:38:51:23]
Speaker 4
 Talking about divorce right and I said that that they file for irreconcilable differences, right you asked for the meaning behind the irreconcilable difference I'm fine with that. I just don't think it's infidelity I think that's incorrect and when I just looked it is I mean you made the claim that

[02:38:51:23 - 02:39:04:19]
Speaker 1
 it's 28 to 58 percent Or 28 to 59 percent list of our innocent affair as a primary trigger. I mean that that's quite a lot I Mean up to 15% depending on the study that could be number one in some studies

[02:39:04:19 - 02:39:07:03]
Speaker 4
 It is but you can't tell me where

[02:39:07:03 - 02:39:11:06]
Speaker 3
 I you're violating women for filing for divorce making it sound like it

[02:39:11:06 - 02:39:17:04]
Speaker 1
 I mean just by definition. It has to be a number one like 15 percent. It's 60 percent is it's over half so

[02:39:19:03 - 02:39:31:05]
Speaker 1
 Even if the next one took up all of it would still be less so It's got to be that in some studies infidelity is number one Because it's it's very ensure with a good way different studies, so

[02:39:33:13 - 02:39:48:18]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, I mean in the incompatibility it's 43 to 75 percent of any study so it could be 43 percent and you know In failure something else could be basically follow the rest of it so and like maybe a lot of two percent for something else so yeah, it could be

[02:39:49:25 - 02:40:15:04]
Speaker 1
 Depending on the study that it really is the case that it wasn't really first and You know money somewhere in there see it's it's set up three here But just because one is ranked slightly higher than the other depending on the study doesn't mean that it's like just so much more important or so much different like I'm sure it's usually probably a combination of these things and depending how you want to phrase it What it is that's happening?

[02:40:15:04 - 02:40:21:13]
Speaker 3
 Like it's just some fly-by-the-night thing they decided to do there's typically a reason and you read some not

[02:40:21:13 - 02:40:23:18]
Speaker 5
 saying that there's not reasons Okay, the question.

[02:40:23:18 - 02:40:29:13]
Speaker 4
 Why do you blame women for single? I shouldn't the question is whether or not there's good well first of all can you be a single mother never be married?

[02:40:30:14 - 02:40:39:22]
Speaker 4
 Sure, but where's the father in this scenario? Yes? Well? Here's the thing don't quartz Adjust towards women even when they aren't married Do you know one in one?

[02:40:39:22 - 02:40:45:19]
Speaker 3
 Three children born out of wedlock don't see their father past the age of three did you know that hmm?

[02:40:46:29 - 02:40:47:05]
Speaker 4
 Why?

[02:40:48:05 - 02:40:50:00]
Speaker 4
 You tell me I'm I'm waiting

[02:40:50:00 - 02:40:54:03]
Speaker 5
 no you tell me why do I need to tell you when I ask you a question? Why because single

[02:40:54:03 - 02:40:56:13]
Speaker 3
 motherhood is not just a female problem. Okay?

[02:40:56:13 - 02:41:34:25]
Speaker 1
 Just just blaming women for You know just being single mothers, which by the way is interesting because he married a single mother, but Just blaming women for that and so what it's his wife's fault that she was a single mother I Does he like rub it in all the day like hey by the way you were single mother is you're so bad like I? Don't want to say wouldn't be surprised But you know he saved her so that's good. Thank you. Enjoy the hero Yeah, it's that's interesting that it's just I would swim in bad, but What about what about the father like what happened to the father did he?

[02:41:35:26 - 02:41:52:28]
Speaker 1
 Run away was the woman just like so bad I knew all that he just couldn't stand to be around her or did he just like he had better stuff to do and just wanted to abandon The family of the child or whatever why do you know women get all the blame here? You know from him specifically

[02:41:52:28 - 02:41:58:24]
Speaker 4
 okay, but why do they not have access because men tend to abandon children? Can you demonstrate that yeah?

[02:41:58:24 - 02:41:59:26]
Speaker 1
 I mean that does happen often.

[02:41:59:26 - 02:42:01:20]
Speaker 3
 I think I just did how?

[02:42:02:21 - 02:42:05:08]
Speaker 3
 33% of children don't see their father past age of the reality

[02:42:05:08 - 02:42:09:25]
Speaker 4
 that doesn't prove that it's because the men don't want to Okay,

[02:42:09:25 - 02:42:33:03]
Speaker 1
 how many men show there's cases where like women are just evil and they just for some reason want to take the kid away from the father but that's just not that often compared to like legitimate reasons why you know they shouldn't see their father for reasons of you know abuse or Where the father is just absent because he just doesn't feel like being there so

[02:42:37:11 - 02:42:45:07]
Speaker 1
 It's just so much smaller where it's just the one being evil Why he's making out to me just like oh, it's it's gotta be the woman's fault no matter what

[02:42:45:07 - 02:42:48:25]
Speaker 3
 Men file for custody of the child in a child court

[02:42:48:25 - 02:42:53:16]
Speaker 4
 I Don't know the stats off the top of my head we can look 95%

[02:42:53:16 - 02:43:02:19]
Speaker 3
 of them are filed Without contest from the father and the 4% that do typically do get it so if 95% of men are fighting for the child I think you can look at men for the problem.

[02:43:02:19 - 02:43:11:10]
Speaker 4
 Oh, I see okay, so let's back up Tell me something who can actually have children men or women

[02:43:21:11 - 02:43:29:25]
Speaker 7
 Alright, well I think we were over here somewhere so let's kind of continue where we left off last night.

[02:43:32:19 - 02:43:39:10]
Speaker 3
 Making it sound like it's just some fly by the night thing they decided to do. There's typically a reason and you read some of them. I'm not saying that there's not reasons.

[02:43:39:10 - 02:43:46:03]
Speaker 4
 Okay. The question is- Why do you blame women for single motherhood? The question is whether or not there's good- well first of all, can you be a single mother and never be married?

[02:43:47:06 - 02:43:47:12]
Speaker 1
 Sure, but where's-

[02:43:48:12 - 02:43:58:16]
Speaker 1
 Okay, so it looks like they're back to the single mothers thing. I'm not sure if I've run it a little bit too far or if this is like a repeat from earlier.

[02:44:00:25 - 02:44:07:13]
Speaker 1
 But yeah, the whole blaming women for everything that's kind of pattern here. So I'm not surprised that you kind of hit them with that.

[02:44:07:13 - 02:44:15:04]
Speaker 4
 Well, where's the father in this scenario? Yes, well here's the thing. Don't court. Adjust towards women even when they aren't married.

[02:44:16:07 - 02:44:22:02]
Speaker 3
 Do you know one in three children born out of wedlock don't see their father past the age of three? Did you know that? Mmm.

[02:44:23:04 - 02:44:23:10]
Speaker 3
 Why?

[02:44:23:10 - 02:44:26:16]
Speaker 1
 Let me guess, that's also somehow the woman's fault.

[02:44:28:21 - 02:44:32:25]
Speaker 6
 You tell me. I'm waiting. No, you tell me. Why do I need to tell you when I-

[02:44:32:25 - 02:44:35:02]
Speaker 1
 No you, no you, wait, no you.

[02:44:35:02 - 02:44:40:17]
Speaker 3
 I asked you a question. Why? Because single motherhood is not just a female problem.

[02:44:40:17 - 02:44:45:25]
Speaker 4
 Okay, but why do they not have access to the child? Because men tend to abandon children. Can you demonstrate that?

[02:44:47:19 - 02:44:50:03]
Speaker 1
 I mean, it's kind of basically like a trope.

[02:44:51:17 - 02:44:53:10]
Speaker 1
 And yeah, I mean,

[02:44:54:24 - 02:45:04:28]
Speaker 1
 I think men abandoning children is way more common than women abandoning children. It's pretty much like, I don't know, anyone else who would argue otherwise.

[02:45:07:24 - 02:45:08:28]
Speaker 3
 I think I just did. How?

[02:45:10:09 - 02:45:12:22]
Speaker 3
 33% of children don't see their father past the age of three in a wedlock.

[02:45:12:22 - 02:45:14:15]
Speaker 4
 That doesn't prove that it's because-

[02:45:14:15 - 02:45:18:19]
Speaker 1
 Let me guess, it's somehow the woman's fault that they made the father leave or something.

[02:45:19:29 - 02:45:35:23]
Speaker 1
 I mean, from everything else that this guy has said, it wouldn't surprise me if he was just like, "Oh yeah, the women, they just nagged too much and that's why the man has a very right to be on the kids, because they just, the nagging women."

[02:45:38:21 - 02:45:40:04]
Speaker 4
 It's because the men don't want to.

[02:45:41:10 - 02:45:45:10]
Speaker 3
 Okay, how many men file for custody of the child in a child court?

[02:45:46:27 - 02:45:49:01]
Speaker 4
 I don't know the stats off the top of my head.

[02:45:49:01 - 02:45:59:04]
Speaker 3
 We can look. 95% of them are filed without contest from the father and the 4% that do typically do get it. So if 95% of men are fighting for the child, I think you can look at men for the problem.

[02:45:59:04 - 02:46:05:06]
Speaker 1
 Oh, I see. I mean, that kind of makes sense, but let's see what he's got here.

[02:46:05:06 - 02:46:06:21]
Speaker 4
 Okay, so let's back up.

[02:46:08:03 - 02:46:08:22]
Speaker 4
 Tell me something.

[02:46:10:11 - 02:46:12:19]
Speaker 4
 Who can actually have children, men or women?

[02:46:12:19 - 02:46:23:21]
Speaker 1
 Let me guess, is this some kind of roundabout way to try to like deflect, redirect the conversation somewhere else? Because I mean, what are you going to say to that?

[02:46:24:23 - 02:46:33:12]
Speaker 4
 Women. Okay. Are these women being raped? No. Okay, so they have the responsibility of making sure that they don't get pregnant, right?

[02:46:34:15 - 02:46:38:06]
Speaker 3
 I think two people have the responsibility to make sure they don't get somebody pregnant as well.

[02:46:38:06 - 02:46:58:03]
Speaker 4
 Tell me that it is the case that most men will sleep with most women, but most women won't sleep with most men. So what? So if that's the case, right, then women have greater access than men do, don't they? Sure. So if that's the case, why are they granting access to men who abandon their kids?

[02:46:58:03 - 02:47:00:07]
Speaker 3
 How do they know they're going to abandon their kids?

[02:47:01:25 - 02:47:09:22]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, I mean, this is kind of a weird place to take it. I mean, what is this? Like, oh, don't have sex.

[02:47:10:24 - 02:47:10:28]
Speaker 1
 Okay.

[02:47:12:03 - 02:47:18:09]
Speaker 1
 But, you know, once it gets in the picture, it's on both people, right? If,

[02:47:19:19 - 02:47:24:13]
Speaker 1
 I mean, this whole, oh, it's the woman's fault. Everything is the woman's fault. It's just getting kind of old, honestly.

[02:47:25:14 - 02:47:25:20]
Speaker 1
 Like.

[02:47:26:20 - 02:47:30:10]
Speaker 4
 Oh my God. That's so weird though. Wait a second. Let's back up.

[02:47:30:10 - 02:47:30:16]
Speaker 7
 Mm-hmm.

[02:47:30:16 - 02:47:41:19]
Speaker 4
 They're the ones who have the sexual access, right? So if they don't know, why are they sleeping with these men? They're the ones who get pregnant, not the men. And men are the ones that get them pregnant. Yeah.

[02:47:41:19 - 02:47:44:25]
Speaker 1
 Okay. Like, yeah. So what the,

[02:47:46:17 - 02:47:46:27]
Speaker 1
 like,

[02:47:47:28 - 02:47:50:22]
Speaker 1
 either way, I don't understand.

[02:47:51:25 - 02:47:54:13]
Speaker 3
 What? They're a part of the equation. So what?

[02:47:54:13 - 02:47:57:28]
Speaker 4
 That's a part of the equation. Yeah, but women are the ones who get to access them.

[02:47:57:28 - 02:47:59:07]
Speaker 1
 What does this have to do with anything?

[02:47:59:07 - 02:48:02:09]
Speaker 3
 That. And men are the ones that access it.

[02:48:02:09 - 02:48:17:24]
Speaker 4
 Right. Can men have abortions? No. Can men force women to have abortions? No. Do you believe women should be able to have abortions? Yes. Well, if that's the case, right? That you believe women's, women ought to be able to have abortions. Men ought not to have any say on whether or not women have a...

[02:48:17:24 - 02:48:43:28]
Speaker 1
 Okay. I mean, this, sure, I generally agree with the kind of logical line where if women can have abortions, men should also be able to opt out of the child's life. But I mean, this isn't... That's not the point here. Just because you legally can, or legally at least should be able to, it doesn't have anything to do with the father's abandoning the kids.

[02:48:45:04 - 02:49:07:11]
Speaker 1
 That's still a problem that's happening. So what is he saying? They should be able to... I mean, okay. But from his perspective, women shouldn't be allowed to have abortions. So then men should be abetting their kids. Like from his perspective, it's the opposite. I don't understand.

[02:49:09:07 - 02:49:14:15]
Speaker 4
 Have abortions. Then women are the ones who ultimately have 100% access around reproduction, not men.

[02:49:14:15 - 02:49:16:10]
Speaker 3
 So men have no responsibility in your eyes?

[02:49:16:10 - 02:49:20:06]
Speaker 4
 How could they have a responsibility if they're not allowed to make the choice of if the child's even here or not?

[02:49:20:06 - 02:49:21:21]
Speaker 3
 If you got somebody pregnant, would you abandon it?

[02:49:21:21 - 02:49:23:02]
Speaker 1
 I'm pretty sure.

[02:49:24:03 - 02:49:32:15]
Speaker 1
 I don't know if it was him exactly, but I've heard people on this podcast, like the men that they invite on, say things like, "Oh, well, you shouldn't have had sex."

[02:49:33:19 - 02:49:36:19]
Speaker 1
 So well, the men shouldn't have had sex. How about that?

[02:49:38:12 - 02:49:41:26]
Speaker 4
 Abandon them? Do I form a secular worldview or do I form a Christian one?

[02:49:41:26 - 02:49:46:22]
Speaker 3
 Do Christian people abandon their children? No. No, they don't. All Christians are perfect?

[02:49:46:22 - 02:49:50:24]
Speaker 4
 No, no, no, no. Under Christian ethics, you're not too abandoned in your children. Sure.

[02:49:51:29 - 02:49:57:10]
Speaker 3
 So only secular people abandon their children? No, that's not what I said. What did I just say? Christian ethics bans you from...

[02:49:57:10 - 02:50:00:00]
Speaker 4
 Under Christian ethics, you ought not do that.

[02:50:00:00 - 02:50:05:21]
Speaker 1
 Under any kind of ethics, you ought not to do that, so I don't get it.

[02:50:05:21 - 02:50:08:19]
Speaker 4
 Not the same as... Do they don't? Should anyone do that?

[02:50:08:19 - 02:50:18:18]
Speaker 3
 Do I think so? Yeah. Under Christian ethics, no. No, even secular. Do you think people should? Under Christian ethics, I don't think secular people should. And I think secular people also don't think they should abandon their children.

[02:50:18:18 - 02:50:18:29]
Speaker 4
 Okay.

[02:50:18:29 - 02:50:20:15]
Speaker 3
 But they can kill them.

[02:50:21:15 - 02:50:22:19]
Speaker 3
 I don't think it's killing them.

[02:50:22:19 - 02:50:28:00]
Speaker 1
 I'm not children, whatever. I've... Getting into this abortion thing is kind of annoying. I'm just over it.

[02:50:28:00 - 02:50:29:27]
Speaker 4
 Oh, I know, right. We're not gonna...

[02:50:29:27 - 02:50:31:12]
Speaker 6
 You don't think it's killing them? No, it's not.

[02:50:31:12 - 02:50:32:20]
Speaker 4
 Okay, got it.

[02:50:32:20 - 02:50:41:00]
Speaker 1
 You can start and see at the bottom here. They can kill them, but they think that they can... It's your whole issue of abortion every time they get to this is just the same crap back and forth. Let's see if we can just kind of skip over that part.

[02:50:43:09 - 02:50:43:26]
Speaker 1
 Descriptors versus...

[02:50:45:20 - 02:50:47:17]
Speaker 1
 I don't know, luckily it's not that long. Whatever.

[02:50:49:15 - 02:50:55:04]
Speaker 1
 There's still like five, almost five hours left still.

[02:50:55:04 - 02:50:56:14]
Speaker 7
 Holy moly.

[02:50:58:02 - 02:50:59:09]
Speaker 3
 And you don't think secular people do?

[02:50:59:09 - 02:51:06:03]
Speaker 4
 Well, I can't see how secularists could justify it, no. Not if you're making the claim. So you made the claim here... From my worldview, if you have

[02:51:06:03 - 02:51:13:21]
Speaker 3
 a child, you should take care of it, period. Why? Because that's my worldview. Why, though? Because it's your child, you'll justify it for me. I don't need to justify it for you.

[02:51:13:21 - 02:51:26:13]
Speaker 1
 That's a pretty standard worldview. Like once a baby is born, it's reasonable to expect the parents to take care of it, unless they're, for some reason, like really unable.

[02:51:26:13 - 02:51:34:12]
Speaker 4
 When we walk around the logic, here's what we end up with. You say women have complete and total access, should be able to kill a man's kid, right? No.

[02:51:35:14 - 02:51:39:19]
Speaker 1
 Okay, killing a kid is totally different than... I'm not gonna get into this.

[02:51:39:19 - 02:51:49:27]
Speaker 4
 Or should be able to bring it to bear and make sure that the man takes care of the kid, but the man can't tell the woman that she has to have the kid, even if she's pregnant, right? That's correct.

[02:51:49:27 - 02:51:53:26]
Speaker 3
 And if there's a child in the world that that man contributed to, he should take care of it.

[02:51:53:26 - 02:51:55:22]
Speaker 4
 Okay, so just to make sure that we got this...

[02:51:55:22 - 02:52:20:01]
Speaker 1
 I personally disagree. I think, I mean, it should also be able to opt out before birth, like at around the same time when a woman should be able to opt out. Like, they should be able to opt out at the same time, like in the same timeframe. So for instance, if it's like the third trimester and the woman can't opt out, so to say, anymore,

[02:52:21:12 - 02:52:43:16]
Speaker 1
 I don't think the man should be able to opt out at that point either. He had his chance beforehand, unless he for some reason wasn't notified properly or something like that. Like, in weird circumstances, I think it could be extended. But if women have a certain timeframe at which, during which they can opt out, then men should also be able to opt out during the timeframe.

[02:52:45:13 - 02:53:07:04]
Speaker 4
 Got this right. It's an uneven standard for men versus women. If that's the world we live in. Yeah. So justify why it is that men shouldn't say, "Fuck that." I don't need to. Okay. Well, then when you asked me, "Andrew, don't you think X?" and I say, "Well, yeah." And you say, "I can't... From a secular point of view, I actually can't answer the justification. Just remember that neither can you."

[02:53:07:04 - 02:53:10:13]
Speaker 3
 And I would say most secular people also believe you should take care of a child if you're the one that's...

[02:53:10:13 - 02:53:15:29]
Speaker 4
 From the ethical angle, of course, of course you're supposed to take care of your children. But from the Christian ethical...

[02:53:15:29 - 02:53:20:19]
Speaker 1
 Of course, from any angle, you're supposed to take care of your children. What kind of argument is that?

[02:53:20:19 - 02:53:28:16]
Speaker 4
 Well, it's also completely appropriate, right, to put significant pressure on women to not have abortions. Meaning, men get a say in the choice, right?

[02:53:28:16 - 02:53:37:06]
Speaker 3
 What's wild to me is that you're complaining about single motherhood and then you're sitting here saying, "Well, men should say, "Fuck it," which is just wild, that men should say, "Fuck it," if they want to.

[02:53:37:06 - 02:53:42:04]
Speaker 4
 When did I say when... You said, "So men should say, "Fuck it," right?" I'm sorry. What an ought is versus a descriptor.

[02:53:43:09 - 02:53:43:26]
Speaker 4
 What's an ought?

[02:53:43:26 - 02:53:45:15]
Speaker 3
 An ought is... I don't know, actually.

[02:53:45:15 - 02:53:49:27]
Speaker 4
 Did I say that secular men ought to that? Or did I say, "I can't think of a justification"?

[02:53:49:27 - 02:54:01:28]
Speaker 1
 You can't think of a just... You said you didn't know what ought means, like ought to, like somebody should do something that could have been right, could it?

[02:54:04:07 - 02:54:07:00]
Speaker 1
 I mean, let's see if he explains better what he meant by that.

[02:54:07:00 - 02:54:07:18]
Speaker 6
 You have a justification.

[02:54:07:18 - 02:54:16:19]
Speaker 3
 But you also don't think single motherhood is a good thing, correct? That's correct. So why don't you encourage men to take care of the children? Should we force them to?

[02:54:16:19 - 02:54:36:15]
Speaker 4
 I think so. Okay. So you think that we should force men to take care of the kids? Correct. That's what child support is. No, no, no, no. No, that's not... Well, that is true that they take it by force, I guess. That's what you said. But what I'm talking about force is like, should we make them participate as a father? Yes.

[02:54:36:15 - 02:54:38:05]
Speaker 3
 We should force that.

[02:54:39:10 - 02:54:41:04]
Speaker 3
 As long as the court rules that they should, yes.

[02:54:42:10 - 02:54:43:21]
Speaker 4
 No, that's different.

[02:54:43:21 - 02:54:51:13]
Speaker 1
 I mean, I don't know if that's a good idea. You can't force somebody to be a dad, you know?

[02:54:53:07 - 02:55:11:24]
Speaker 1
 Sure, like if, say, they are past the point where they should have opted out and they chose to stay and they should probably still pay at that point if they chose to consent it to having it.

[02:55:13:02 - 02:55:23:24]
Speaker 1
 But if later on they decide, "Oh, never mind. It's not for me. I don't really want to be a dad." I don't think you should force a man to be a dad. I mean, she should still continue paying because they signed up for it at that point.

[02:55:24:24 - 02:55:55:18]
Speaker 1
 And that would have informed the woman's decision to continue having it, possibly. So I mean, at that point you're stuck with at least being financially responsible but forcing a man to just be a dad, be there emotionally and spending time and all of that. I don't know if that's right. It could end up, like if you force somebody to do something like that, it's likely it could actually turn out worse to force somebody than to just not have them there at all.

[02:55:56:21 - 02:56:28:21]
Speaker 1
 There's other male role models that a child could have in their life to replace, that you can't fully replace a father, but it's better to have one that's not there than one that a child could tell it does not want to be there. If kids can pick up on that kind of stuff, they can tell. I could really mess it up if they can tell that their dad doesn't want them and is constantly seeing that and feeling that. Just be wrong.

[02:56:30:17 - 02:56:35:16]
Speaker 4
 Different. I'm not asking about what the court rules. I'm asking, do you think we should force men to participate?

[02:56:35:16 - 02:56:38:08]
Speaker 3
 I think they should force at least child support.

[02:56:38:08 - 02:56:42:27]
Speaker 4
 And if the father- No, no, that's not my question. Well, that's what I'm saying. Should they force men to participate?

[02:56:42:27 - 02:56:46:11]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, I mean, he did say child support, but let's see.

[02:56:46:11 - 02:56:49:29]
Speaker 4
 Right, and being a father. Being a father, no.

[02:56:49:29 - 02:56:53:24]
Speaker 1
 Okay, thank you. I'm glad he said that as far as the West kind of confused you.

[02:56:55:07 - 02:57:00:04]
Speaker 3
 No. No. No. If a father's going to be a shitty father, then no.

[02:57:00:04 - 02:57:12:02]
Speaker 4
 Can you explain to me how it is that if the woman can get child support from the guy, right, and you were not going to force any participation, aren't you pushing single motherhood?

[02:57:12:02 - 02:57:22:03]
Speaker 3
 No, you're blaming women for single motherhood. Yeah. What does that have to do? You don't have all the choice by your own admission. But the fathers have no part to play in it. And single motherhood fathers have no part to play.

[02:57:22:03 - 02:57:38:09]
Speaker 4
 If it is the case that fathers can't make the determination as to whether or not they can even have the kid, and only the woman can, you hold an uneven playing field, I have at least a consistent view. That women should not be allowed to abort, and men ought to actually be made to participate in their own children's life.

[02:57:39:13 - 02:57:42:19]
Speaker 4
 That's my consistent worldview. That's so messed up.

[02:57:42:19 - 02:57:50:28]
Speaker 1
 Both points, honestly, forcing a man to be there if they don't want to, that could just lead to so many terrible things.

[02:57:52:15 - 02:57:55:23]
Speaker 1
 And the whole abortion thing, I'm just so tired of it.

[02:57:55:23 - 02:58:00:01]
Speaker 4
 Worldview's inconsistent. Okay. You're making things... Yeah, totally inconsistent.

[02:58:00:01 - 02:58:09:12]
Speaker 3
 I said that if a man has a child... You're just giving privilege to women. Sure. If a man has a child, they should take care of it. Do they? That's a different story. I'm saying they should.

[02:58:09:12 - 02:58:14:29]
Speaker 4
 If women have children, should they take care of it? Yeah. Can they give it up for adoption? Okay. Can the man make the woman give...

[02:58:16:02 - 02:58:18:22]
Speaker 4
 Why can't the man give up his parental rights and just walk away?

[02:58:18:22 - 02:58:26:28]
Speaker 1
 I think he should be able to. During the point when... Well, it's actually an interesting point because, say,

[02:58:27:28 - 02:58:57:28]
Speaker 1
 the woman chooses to not be a mother during the first trimester or whatever, and that should be allowed. But also, I think during the first trimester, a man should also be able to opt out. Maybe the woman would base her decision on that. Maybe not. Maybe if she knows that he's not going to be there, she might decide not to keep it. Or if she knows that he is going to be there because he hasn't opted out, she might be more inclined to keep it in certain situations.

[02:58:59:16 - 02:59:05:25]
Speaker 1
 But giving it up for adoption, that's interesting because I think at that point,

[02:59:07:09 - 02:59:08:11]
Speaker 1
 say,

[02:59:09:16 - 02:59:30:00]
Speaker 1
 a woman chooses to go through with her pregnancy, but she still intends to get off her adoption, that should still count as choosing not to have the baby, even though she's actually physically having it. She has absolved herself of the parental responsibility, basically.

[02:59:31:15 - 02:59:32:29]
Speaker 1
 So yeah, that's interesting.

[02:59:35:29 - 02:59:36:28]
Speaker 1
 I don't know. I guess that's tricky.

[02:59:37:29 - 02:59:44:09]
Speaker 1
 She at first wants the child the whole time during her pregnancy, but then the child is born and suddenly she's like, "Nope, don't want it."

[02:59:45:16 - 02:59:54:04]
Speaker 1
 There might be some psychological problems there. I mean, postpartum, depression, and things like that playing a role, so that's definitely complicated.

[02:59:55:06 - 02:59:57:08]
Speaker 1
 But in the rare cases that does happen,

[02:59:58:12 - 03:00:38:10]
Speaker 1
 I don't know. It's tricky, but since that kind of thing is just so rare, I don't think relying on that to make rules for what the men should not be allowed to do is a good idea. But honestly, I haven't really fleshed this out too well. I just have this general sense that if women should be able to opt out, then men should also be able to opt out. And if there are certain time frames for when women are allowed to opt out, I think there should also be certain time frames that would box in when a man would be able to opt out. But obviously,

[03:00:39:11 - 03:01:04:01]
Speaker 1
 this kind of thing is just so different. What women go through versus what men go through during pregnancy is completely different. It's difficult to find something that would be 100% fair for both parties. You're never gonna have something that's just 100% straight down the line equal in this kind of situation, just on the basis of biology, there's just no way.

[03:01:05:26 - 03:01:08:21]
Speaker 3
 If the woman can. If the woman does, then he can.

[03:01:08:21 - 03:01:11:11]
Speaker 4
 Well, wait, that's really weird. I don't get it.

[03:01:12:15 - 03:01:20:06]
Speaker 4
 If it is the case that the mother has guardianship of the father's child, she can still put the child up for adoption, right? Sure. Okay.

[03:01:20:06 - 03:01:21:12]
Speaker 3
 But he can't.

[03:01:22:15 - 03:01:25:21]
Speaker 3
 If he has guardianship of the child, he can't. If he has guardianship, right?

[03:01:25:21 - 03:01:28:17]
Speaker 4
 So he can too. But if she's a single mom, what gives him guardianship?

[03:01:28:17 - 03:01:30:21]
Speaker 3
 Well, he doesn't have guardianship. I'm saying if a,

[03:01:30:21 - 03:01:45:25]
Speaker 1
 what makes her, what kind of question is that? If she's a single mom, what gives him guardianship? Well, nothing. She's a single mom. What does that have to do with anything? Like if, if he's not around and he's not claiming his rights, like what?

[03:01:47:19 - 03:01:49:01]
Speaker 1
 I don't get it.

[03:01:50:01 - 03:01:56:16]
Speaker 3
 If a father has guardianship, he can also put up the child for adoption. It's not just a mother. Yeah. But who does it default to? Why does it default to women?

[03:01:57:24 - 03:02:04:15]
Speaker 4
 Because that's the way the system is set. How is it set that way? Because it's, it has become matrilineal rather than patrilineal.

[03:02:04:15 - 03:02:11:23]
Speaker 3
 What does that mean? What does that mean to you? It means from the father or from the mother. No, I know the definition. You always use those words, but why is it family court?

[03:02:11:23 - 03:02:17:04]
Speaker 4
 Why is it giving it to women? Because feminists have made huge pushes in order to make it that way.

[03:02:17:04 - 03:02:23:19]
Speaker 3
 Feminists have pushed that women get custody of the child. Yeah. Are most judges in family court, men or women?

[03:02:23:19 - 03:02:31:21]
Speaker 4
 And family court, they're men. And so they're influenced by feminists. I'm sorry, wait a second. Are you saying that men can't be feminists?

[03:02:31:21 - 03:02:39:17]
Speaker 3
 I'm saying that I doubt that the majority of families. Are you saying that men can't be feminists? I'm saying that I doubt all the family court judges are so influenced by.

[03:02:39:17 - 03:02:48:02]
Speaker 1
 I mean, I'm not surprised that I'm just kind of pushing this whole thing. And it has been anybody who's not, you know, 100% on his level as a feminist.

[03:02:48:02 - 03:02:52:22]
Speaker 4
 So the family court judges have to adhere to the law or do they make the law?

[03:02:54:05 - 03:02:56:07]
Speaker 3
 I'm not sure if they make the law or not. If they have to.

[03:02:56:07 - 03:03:00:27]
Speaker 1
 No, they don't make, judges don't make laws. They're supposed to interpret them.

[03:03:00:27 - 03:03:31:18]
Speaker 4
 Here's the law. They don't make it, right? Yeah. So family court judges are just adhering to the law, right? And what's the law say? Yeah. The law you, so here's what happened. You just have to have what are called coverture laws. Covature laws actually forced men to take care of their families. That very same thing that you want, right? Of course, this also made children their property and women, right? Were also part of the man then, right? That was how it went. But guess what? They had to take care of their family or they went to fucking jail. That's what happened. Marriage has stayed together about 90, 95%. Okay.

[03:03:31:18 - 03:03:39:10]
Speaker 1
 I mean, staying together under threat. I don't know how I feel about that. That just sounds 

[03:03:41:05 - 03:03:44:11]
Speaker 1
icky. Like, is that a good thing? Is she like, telling them it was a good thing here?

[03:03:44:11 - 03:03:52:04]
Speaker 4
 You know what happened? Feminist really pushed real fucking hard for the average default laws. And here's where the average default laws were.

[03:03:53:13 - 03:04:02:17]
Speaker 4
 Oh, the average default laws were saying basically on average, the default's going to go to women, right? Now there's a whole series of laws I can pull up and go through, but yes.

[03:04:02:17 - 03:04:21:06]
Speaker 1
 I mean, I don't know how I feel about this particular topic either, that by default, if there has to be a default, I think it makes sense that it's women because they're usually the caretakers and they're the ones who can physically naturally feed the baby.

[03:04:22:20 - 03:04:32:07]
Speaker 1
 Not that formula doesn't exist. Now that we do have formula, of course, there are more options. But I don't see why there just has to be a default.

[03:04:33:24 - 03:04:48:09]
Speaker 1
 I mean, if there has to be one, it makes sense that it's women, but I don't think there has to be a default necessarily. And I think that's... I heard that was changing too, but it's unfortunate that fathers are just seen as incapable, usually,

[03:04:49:18 - 03:04:50:04]
Speaker 1
 by default.

[03:04:51:04 - 03:04:56:07]
Speaker 1
 I don't think that's right. And I do think it's changing if you've seen a lot of sentiment going the other way.

[03:04:57:07 - 03:05:01:08]
Speaker 4
 Yes, this was pushed by feminists so that there was default laws which pushed,

[03:05:02:11 - 03:05:07:15]
Speaker 4
 literally, that women, by default, had custody. Yes, that is correct.

[03:05:07:15 - 03:05:12:22]
Speaker 3
 That is not how it works because if a father tries to get custody of the child...

[03:05:12:22 - 03:05:52:01]
Speaker 1
 It's also kind of interesting because he's saying feminists were pushing for the women to get custody of the kids and all of that. But I thought that he also stated that feminists are for it being equal between genders. Or is that what he perceives as the hypocrisy of it? That they say it's equal, but it's not. And then there's also the whole thing where he claims that feminists are against families, anti-children, anti-natalists, or whatever. So why would feminists who are so anti-children be pro, you know, holding down the woman with their responsibilities of a child?

[03:05:53:03 - 03:05:54:07]
Speaker 1
 I don't know if that really follows.

[03:05:58:03 - 03:06:01:01]
Speaker 3
 The child, they often do get it. But most...

[03:06:01:01 - 03:06:01:18]
Speaker 1
 They do now.

[03:06:01:18 - 03:06:03:26]
Speaker 3
 Also feminists have failed them? No, pro. There's been...

[03:06:03:26 - 03:06:21:06]
Speaker 1
 So yeah, even they admit that it seems like things are changing now that if fathers do want the kid in custody that they do get it. So yeah, I'm happy to see that that's changed for the positive. But you could argue that women also had...

[03:06:22:15 - 03:07:11:02]
Speaker 1
 Not that long ago that you couldn't even have credit cards and things like that. So there were rights a while ago that women didn't have. And it seems like a short time ago, there was something men didn't really have and now they do. And it's great that we're moving towards a place where everybody's getting more of their rights. So I mean, I think that's a good thing. But if you want to go back to the past and rehash everything, how far do we go? Do we go 10 years, 20, 80, 100? Do we go into reparations? Where does this go? And reparations how far? For everybody? For who? At some point, every group and every particular category of people you could think of was oppressed in some way.

[03:07:12:03 - 03:07:33:11]
Speaker 4
 There's been... Since men's rights movement started, especially in about the mid 2000s, there have been reforms to the laws. Male custody has quadrupled because of men's rights advocacy groups. And yes, quadrupled. And yes, I can grab you that stat if you want it. It has quadrupled because these laws have now begun to get rolled back.

[03:07:34:11 - 03:07:38:23]
Speaker 1
 Okay, so that sounds like there are some crappy laws and they're getting rid of them. So okay.

[03:07:40:07 - 03:07:41:22]
Speaker 4
 It should just be a straight default.

[03:07:41:22 - 03:07:50:10]
Speaker 3
 A straight default. How long... Because my understanding of this is most fathers aren't filing for custodial guardianship of the child.

[03:07:50:10 - 03:08:08:29]
Speaker 4
 Yeah, you're talking... You have to understand that you're looking at it from a historic prism that doesn't make any sense. You're talking about modern laws and the way that modern custody arrangements happen. It wasn't always this case. The case used to be actually that children went to the men. That was the old laws under coverture.

[03:08:08:29 - 03:08:15:08]
Speaker 1
 Okay, so it used to be that they went by default to the men, which was not great. No, they...

[03:08:16:09 - 03:08:38:12]
Speaker 1
 Not now, but after that, they went by default to the women, which was also not great. And now it seems like things are balancing out more where they get shared custody or if the men ask for it, they get it. If the women ask for it, they get it. And at that point, they share or if only one asks, they get it. So it just seems like it's become more fair. So it's what they're even gonna argue about here.

[03:08:39:16 - 03:08:46:16]
Speaker 4
 Virtue laws, right? That changed with feminism and radical feminism pushing for those laws to be changed.

[03:08:46:16 - 03:08:51:05]
Speaker 3
 So you're saying there was a time when the children were raised... There were more single fathers than single mothers?

[03:08:51:05 - 03:08:54:10]
Speaker 4
 No, there just wasn't really any erosion of marriage.

[03:08:54:10 - 03:09:03:19]
Speaker 3
 Okay, then why did you say that? Why did you make that point? The point that...

[03:09:03:19 - 03:09:04:22]
Speaker 7
 Back

[03:09:04:22 - 03:09:10:18]
Speaker 3
 in the day, men were getting custody of the children, but then there were still more single mothers.

[03:09:10:18 - 03:09:28:06]
Speaker 4
 No, there wasn't very many single mothers either. Okay, but they outnumbered the single fathers. No, there wasn't... Listen, these marriages stayed together, but under the law, it was true under the coverture laws that the child was the property or was at least associated property to the father, yes.

[03:09:29:07 - 03:09:34:09]
Speaker 1
 I'm not... I don't know a lot about this, but if what he's saying is true, it kind of sounds like

[03:09:35:18 - 03:09:43:02]
Speaker 1
 they were basically holding the kids hostage. So if the woman was to leave, they would have to abandon their children.

[03:09:44:03 - 03:09:47:01]
Speaker 1
 So they were basically forced to stay with men, whether they liked it or not.

[03:09:48:07 - 03:10:03:10]
Speaker 1
 That sounds terrible, honestly. I mean, is that true? Is what he's saying true? I don't know. Honestly, I don't know. But if that is, that's not the great, wonderful thing that he says it is. Yes.

[03:10:03:10 - 03:10:06:26]
Speaker 3
 I'm glad we're having this discussion because it goes back to the point that I've been trying to make.

[03:10:06:26 - 03:10:08:10]
Speaker 4
 Can you explain, though, your logic there?

[03:10:08:10 - 03:10:11:29]
Speaker 3
 I'm trying to actually understand the logic. No, I'm not going to... I'm not going to... I'm not going to... I'm not going to... No, I want to get back to the thing we're talking about.

[03:10:11:29 - 03:10:14:07]
Speaker 4
 No, no, no. Hang on.

[03:10:14:07 - 03:10:16:09]
Speaker 3
 Hang on. Why don't you escape? It's not about escaping.

[03:10:16:09 - 03:10:18:25]
Speaker 4
 Before I let you escape, I just want to get back to this logic, though.

[03:10:20:13 - 03:10:25:14]
Speaker 4
 This is the point that there was more... This is the point that I'm trying to make. Hang on. Stop, bro. I don't want to... I just want to finish it. I want to get back to...

[03:10:25:14 - 03:10:45:13]
Speaker 1
 Why does he always get the big little stop, stop, and he's the one that always gets his way? I'm glad this other guy is pushing back a little bit because usually he just kind of bullies people into submission. We'll see if this other guy can push back. I don't know if he's going to be able to. He just gets louder and louder at some point. He's just a big baby about it.

[03:10:45:13 - 03:10:48:22]
Speaker 6
 If you say this to this last question, we can move it off.

[03:10:48:22 - 03:10:56:17]
Speaker 3
 I want to get to the next thing. I want you to answer my questions. Because the whole point I've been trying to make this whole debate is that any chance you get, you blame women. Any chance you get...

[03:10:56:17 - 03:10:57:25]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, that's true.

[03:10:57:25 - 03:10:59:11]
Speaker 3
 You blame women.

[03:10:59:11 - 03:11:04:25]
Speaker 1
 Single mothers... I'm glad he didn't back down because usually people kind of eventually give up.

[03:11:04:25 - 03:11:10:07]
Speaker 3
 For everything. You blame women for the downfall of society. Andrew... Let me ask you this.

[03:11:10:07 - 03:11:13:06]
Speaker 6
 Do you blame women for the downfall of society? No, I don't blame them for the...

[03:11:13:06 - 03:11:19:07]
Speaker 1
 Let me say, "Oh, he blames feminism." I'm sure he can split hairs, but...

[03:11:19:07 - 03:11:24:20]
Speaker 3
 Downfall of society. The current trend of society? You don't? No. You never said that?

[03:11:24:20 - 03:11:31:19]
Speaker 4
 No. What I blame women for specifically is feminism. And feminist marks...

[03:11:32:20 - 03:11:34:16]
Speaker 4
 ...this ideology. I do blame them for that.

[03:11:34:16 - 03:11:45:06]
Speaker 3
 Okay, and as you said, feminism is a reason there's so many single mothers, right? I think it's a core reason, yeah. Okay, so is that contributed to the downfall of society? Sure. So through that logic, women are contributed to the downfall? Exactly.

[03:11:45:06 - 03:11:49:29]
Speaker 1
 I mean, he just drew it pretty much straight from A to B right there.

[03:11:49:29 - 03:11:50:09]
Speaker 3
 Fall of society?

[03:11:50:09 - 03:11:51:13]
Speaker 1
 A to B to C.

[03:11:51:13 - 03:11:58:17]
Speaker 4
 Yeah, but men would also be contributing to the downfall of society. Okay, so you blame women mostly for the downfall of society? I blame feminism, yes.

[03:11:58:17 - 03:12:01:25]
Speaker 1
 And he just said that he blames women for feminism and he blames...

[03:12:02:26 - 03:12:10:23]
Speaker 1
 Or rather, he blames women for feminism and he blames feminism for the downfall of society. So he just said that with "What is this?"

[03:12:10:23 - 03:12:12:10]
Speaker 4
 A analogy of feminism.

[03:12:13:11 - 03:12:30:23]
Speaker 4
 Which is women... I'm blaming the ideology. So you're just asking about the execution. It's like, are you blaming men for the downfall of society, of a society which is mostly communist? Or would you be blaming... because they're enforcing everything? Or would you be blaming the ideology? You're blaming women... Can you answer my question?

[03:12:30:23 - 03:12:34:21]
Speaker 6
 No, you're blaming women. No. You're not blaming the ideology because women are the ones who...

[03:12:34:21 - 03:12:38:26]
Speaker 4
 So I'm going to ask the question again until you answer it. Okay. So you have a communist country.

[03:12:38:26 - 03:12:44:13]
Speaker 1
 Honestly, I'm getting kind of bored. Let's see if there's any... I'm falling asleep now.

[03:12:46:05 - 03:12:48:26]
Speaker 1
 Let's see topics-wise what we got here.

[03:12:52:23 - 03:12:59:06]
Speaker 1
 Doo-doo-doo. Does he always blame women? Feminism and misogyny. Superchats. Who should raise their children?

[03:13:00:10 - 03:13:03:06]
Speaker 1
 Pregnancies and dating more pregnancy stuff. Oh, Jesus.

[03:13:04:10 - 03:13:05:08]
Speaker 4
 Men for the...

[03:13:07:11 - 03:13:08:10]
Speaker 7
 When the chapters go.

[03:13:09:11 - 03:13:19:04]
Speaker 7
 There's not a lot I meant to do. Okay.

[03:13:27:10 - 03:13:27:22]
Speaker 1
 Let's see.

[03:13:31:15 - 03:13:37:06]
Speaker 1
 Insales and semantics. That might be kind of interesting. Look at the cool red pill. Shoot if there's a house.

[03:13:42:25 - 03:13:43:04]
Speaker 1
 Mm-hmm.

[03:13:44:22 - 03:13:45:13]
Speaker 1
 Who has bad faith?

[03:13:49:28 - 03:13:51:23]
Speaker 1
 I don't know. This one's getting kind of boring.

[03:13:55:07 - 03:13:56:04]
Speaker 7
 Why do I keep doing that?

[03:13:56:04 - 03:13:57:21]
Speaker 3
 Okay, so is that contributed to the downfall?

[03:14:05:11 - 03:14:07:04]
Speaker 1
 Okay.

[03:14:12:29 - 03:14:20:11]
Speaker 1
 All right, well, I'll stick with it for a little bit. We're already an hour in. We'll see how it goes. If it continues to kind of...

[03:14:21:16 - 03:14:35:10]
Speaker 1
 If it continues to not be that entertaining, we'll probably just see if there's other chapters that might sound interesting to kind of jump to. There's a few I saw that might pin out to be a little bit more interesting. We'll see.

[03:14:36:11 - 03:14:40:22]
Speaker 3
 On fall of society? Sure. So through that logic, women are contributed to the downfall of society?

[03:14:40:22 - 03:14:43:05]
Speaker 4
 Yeah, but men would also be contributing to the downfall of society.

[03:14:43:05 - 03:14:47:13]
Speaker 3
 Okay, so you blame women mostly for the downfall of society? Feminism, yes.

[03:14:47:13 - 03:14:52:12]
Speaker 1
 And he blames women for the feminism. He said that. He just said that.

[03:14:52:12 - 03:14:57:19]
Speaker 4
 Ideology of feminism, which is women... I'm blaming the ideology. So you're just asking about the executions.

[03:14:58:25 - 03:15:09:01]
Speaker 4
 Are you blaming men for the downfall of society, of a society which is mostly communist? Or would you be blaming... Because they're enforcing everything? Or would you be blaming the ideology?

[03:15:10:04 - 03:15:10:29]
Speaker 4
 You're blaming women.

[03:15:10:29 - 03:15:15:23]
Speaker 6
 Can you answer my question? No, you're blaming women. No, you're not blaming the ideology because women are the ones who...

[03:15:15:23 - 03:15:26:10]
Speaker 4
 Bro, so I'm going to ask the question again until you answer it. Okay. So you have a communist country, right? And the men are doing most of the bad stuff in the communist country. Would you blame the men or would you blame communism?

[03:15:27:11 - 03:15:30:12]
Speaker 4
 I don't think feminism can answer my fucking question.

[03:15:30:12 - 03:15:30:29]
Speaker 1
 I think...

[03:15:32:00 - 03:15:42:16]
Speaker 1
 That's interesting. I think you would blame the men. I don't think... Like, if people are doing terrible stuff, I think you blame the people. Because it's the same reason that...

[03:15:43:19 - 03:15:45:21]
Speaker 1
 Um... I would blame a person like...

[03:15:47:02 - 03:15:55:24]
Speaker 1
 I don't subscribe to the whole, you know, "Guns don't kill people. People kill people." Like, if somebody goes and, you know, "pew-pews"

[03:15:56:28 - 03:15:57:18]
Speaker 1
 Like, seriously.

[03:15:58:18 - 03:16:25:17]
Speaker 1
 If somebody goes and does a "pew-pew" on somebody, it doesn't mean that, you know, it's the "Guns' fault" or whatever. It's, you know, it's the person's fault. And it's the same reason, like... I can see how ideology might be a little bit different, but still, I think, if people do terrible things, it's the people's fault. If an ideology is bad and it's kind of...

[03:16:27:01 - 03:16:27:12]
Speaker 1
 You know...

[03:16:29:10 - 03:16:41:18]
Speaker 1
 If an ideology is a bad one and is driving people to do bad things, I'm sure it contributes, but still, the primary responsibility rests on the people doing the actions.

[03:16:42:25 - 03:17:02:28]
Speaker 1
 So, yes, people can be influenced, but you can only be influenced so far as to what you have capacity for and it's still just... Personally, I feel like the final blame for whatever bad things happen, lie with the people that do the bad things.

[03:17:05:16 - 03:17:05:22]
Speaker 1
 Question.

[03:17:05:22 - 03:17:09:06]
Speaker 4
 Answer the question. I don't know. Yes or no? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Okay.

[03:17:09:06 - 03:17:18:07]
Speaker 1
 I'll just start answering that one. Because you're saying feminism. I mean, that's fair. He doesn't have a strong opinion on it. It's fine to say, "I don't know." What's with the staff you like?

[03:17:19:19 - 03:17:20:24]
Speaker 1
 The ideology in its own.

[03:17:20:24 - 03:17:21:02]
Speaker 3
 No, no, no.

[03:17:21:02 - 03:17:37:16]
Speaker 4
 Feminism, the ideology on its own. If you lived in a communist country, and it was mostly the men enforcing the communism, you don't know if you'd blame the men or the ideology, really. You don't know? I'd probably blame the men at that point. You'd blame the... Okay, well then... So, you're saying that I should blame women? No, I'm saying that you do.

[03:17:37:16 - 03:17:39:01]
Speaker 6
 I've blamed the ideology.

[03:17:39:01 - 03:17:44:01]
Speaker 4
 No, you're blaming the women at every chance you get. The only consistent thing you could actually say here.

[03:17:44:01 - 03:17:46:15]
Speaker 1
 No, he is blaming the women, but that's not...

[03:17:48:11 - 03:18:08:07]
Speaker 1
 We're not saying that women are doing a terrible thing in society, and therefore we should blame them. He is saying feminism is the bad thing, and women are doing it. Therefore, he's blaming women for doing it for feminism, which is the bad thing in society, right? So, that's what he's claiming here.

[03:18:09:12 - 03:18:17:06]
Speaker 1
 I don't see how that's... I gotcha there. He's acting like everything he says is a scotcha, but it's just that it doesn't follow.

[03:18:18:22 - 03:18:25:10]
Speaker 4
 Sure. Would be, "I blame communism for the way these men are behaving, unless you innately think men are bad."

[03:18:26:23 - 03:18:28:27]
Speaker 4
 What about feminism? Like, do you innately think men are bad?

[03:18:28:27 - 03:18:31:05]
Speaker 3
 What about feminism is bringing about the downfall of society?

[03:18:32:10 - 03:18:39:25]
Speaker 4
 You mean, what is it contributing to? Yeah. It's not just contributing to single motherhood. It also contributes to these two-income households. It's contri...

[03:18:39:25 - 03:18:43:16]
Speaker 1
 Okay, so I've got single motherhood.

[03:18:45:06 - 03:19:09:18]
Speaker 1
 I mean, that one... I mean, he made some points about men leaving. I don't see how you can specifically blame feminism for that. I could see how you could point to some things that might be correlated, and that seemed to be related, I'm sure, but I don't know if you could necessarily prove that it's responsible for higher rates of single mothers,

[03:19:10:28 - 03:19:30:11]
Speaker 1
 just because feminism, it may allow women to escape bad situations better, but it would be those bad situations that would be leading women to become single in those cases, not necessarily the fact that they were...

[03:19:31:13 - 03:19:46:21]
Speaker 1
 the cage was opened up. That's the thing that's putting them in the bad position. That's the cause of those becoming single, not them being released or them being not forced to stay anymore.

[03:19:47:29 - 03:19:50:23]
Speaker 1
 So that's a bit odd to say, too.

[03:19:50:23 - 03:20:02:25]
Speaker 4
 Contributing to... well, it contributes to the fact that we even need two-income households, but one of the major things it contributes to is taking mothers out of the home. That's the biggest way that it contributes to the downfall of society.

[03:20:02:25 - 03:20:10:28]
Speaker 1
 I could see that point, honestly, because if you draw the line that women going into the workforce,

[03:20:12:22 - 03:20:19:07]
Speaker 1
 I could see arguments for how that reduced wages, because there's more supply now,

[03:20:20:18 - 03:20:57:04]
Speaker 1
 supply of labor, there's a whole supply and demand thing. I could see that and I could see how not having parents in the home is probably not as much, it's probably not as good for kids. So I do think that having multi-traditional households would kind of resolve this issue. So you would have grandparents while the parents are working, or not all women have necessarily to work. If they want to focus more on being there for the kids more, or if they do have the kids,

[03:20:58:05 - 03:21:07:01]
Speaker 1
 then they should be able to do that. And if they would rather have a career and not even have kids at all, I think they should be able to do that.

[03:21:08:13 - 03:21:20:07]
Speaker 1
 I think that's kind of what modern day feminism says, is if you want to have a family, you should have a family. If you want to have a career, you should have a career. If you want to do both, there are ways to do both and still deal okay.

[03:21:23:06 - 03:21:40:23]
Speaker 1
 But I could see what he's saying too, I could see how there could be downsides. I don't know a lot of people who argue that there aren't trade-offs for things like, you know, both parents going to work when they have kids to take care of and that kind of thing.

[03:21:42:24 - 03:21:45:18]
Speaker 4
 Society is taking mothers out of the home. Don't you agree?

[03:21:45:18 - 03:21:56:02]
Speaker 3
 I don't agree, but this goes to the point that I think that... How does this change what I said, that you blame feminism for the downfall of society? Well, you didn't say that. You said that I said that initially. I said that in my opening statement as well.

[03:21:56:02 - 03:21:56:14]
Speaker 4
 You said I blame women.

[03:21:56:14 - 03:21:58:18]
Speaker 3
 Who implemented feminism?

[03:21:58:18 - 03:22:03:10]
Speaker 4
 Yeah, so, well, that was a bunch of rich corporatists. And then it was also a lot of women.

[03:22:03:10 - 03:22:36:10]
Speaker 1
 But he did actually say, I blame women for feminism. He said those exact words and now is he backtracking in that anytime that he does any kind of debate? He's always accusing his opponents of, oh, now you're backtracking, now you're backtracking. You're just gonna say this other thing now. You said this other thing before. He's always just poking them about it and being like, oh, ha, ha, ha. Even if they didn't actually do that, regardless of whether it's true or not. But here he is doing that exact thing and he's allowed to. So, that's interesting.

[03:22:37:23 - 03:22:40:17]
Speaker 4
 Who were in bed with women? No, it really was. It was rich corporatists.

[03:22:40:17 - 03:22:41:25]
Speaker 3
 It was the men that implemented feminism?

[03:22:41:25 - 03:22:48:08]
Speaker 4
 It was both. Yeah, it was both. But what do you think? But back to this, I just want to make sure, right?

[03:22:49:12 - 03:23:11:10]
Speaker 4
 Why would it, like, how would it even track that I would blame women for the, or hate women? I'm sorry, hate women. I do blame them if they're feminists for holding that ideology. But that's not all women. That's not me hating women. You made the distinction earlier that if I hate an individual woman, that's not misogyny, right?

[03:23:12:25 - 03:23:14:17]
Speaker 3
 I wouldn't say on an individual level, no.

[03:23:14:17 - 03:23:21:07]
Speaker 4
 Yeah, so then if I hate all feminists, that's only hating individuals with an ideology, right?

[03:23:21:07 - 03:23:23:21]
Speaker 3
 If most women are feminists, wouldn't that be misogynistic?

[03:23:23:21 - 03:23:25:03]
Speaker 4
 I'm not sure that most women...

[03:23:25:03 - 03:24:12:12]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, I mean, according, I mean, every time that they have a panel of women on, he accuses basically every single one of being feminists, no matter how conservative leaning they are. There may have been literally a handful that he hasn't accused of being a feminist. Like, even if they say, "Oh, no, I'm not a feminist," he's like, "Oh, no, you're a feminist. You're definitely a feminist." And then he proceeds to go to straw. Anyway, it's a pattern. It's a pattern to say this whole, you know, that not all women are feminists and not the majority of women are feminists, I don't think he believes that. I mean, at least that's not how he acts usually. He acts as if most women are feminists, whether they say they are, they're just all secretly feminists.

[03:24:14:10 - 03:24:15:27]
Speaker 4
 Well, I don't know. That's hard to say.

[03:24:17:11 - 03:24:27:26]
Speaker 4
 If it is the case, no, actually, even if it was the case that most women were feminists and you hated all women who were feminists, you still wouldn't hate women. You would only hate feminists.

[03:24:27:26 - 03:24:30:12]
Speaker 3
 That's an easy way out of that one. Well, I mean, it's true though, right?

[03:24:30:12 - 03:24:36:13]
Speaker 1
 No, it's not true. Okay, then explain the logic to me. I mean, they're constantly saying that, "Oh, well, if you...

[03:24:37:20 - 03:24:46:22]
Speaker 1
 if something disproportionately affects men, then it's, you know, in a bad way, it's misandry." Like, "Oh, well,

[03:24:47:24 - 03:25:00:14]
Speaker 1
 things like men being... men having to be drafted and things like that, that's, you know, unfair to men and it affects the majority of men."

[03:25:02:04 - 03:25:08:18]
Speaker 1
 But here it's like, "Oh, well, just because it's the majority of women doesn't mean you hate men." Just because...

[03:25:09:24 - 03:25:10:22]
Speaker 1
 yeah, I mean,

[03:25:12:14 - 03:25:13:18]
Speaker 1
 I'd like to...

[03:25:16:16 - 03:25:17:10]
Speaker 1
 Here,

[03:25:20:08 - 03:25:36:00]
Speaker 1
 I'd like to go back a little bit and to make it a little more clear what I'm saying, because maybe some clips would be helpful of kind of what I mean, because saying things like, "Oh, well, it's not just because most women

[03:25:37:01 - 03:25:44:20]
Speaker 1
 are this thing and I hate people who are this thing," doesn't mean I hate all women. Okay, sure, it's "most,"

[03:25:45:27 - 03:25:46:05]
Speaker 1
 but...

[03:25:47:19 - 03:26:05:18]
Speaker 1
 Okay, and then he said, "Well, isn't that misogynist hating women is kind of the... one of the standard definitions people give for misogyny is like just hating women, whether that's correct or not, but they seem to have no problem with that definition here." And he's like, "Well, no, it's not misogyny if I hate most women."

[03:26:07:05 - 03:26:09:23]
Speaker 1
 Does that sound right to you? I mean,

[03:26:10:28 - 03:26:17:15]
Speaker 1
 saying, "Somebody hates most women," that sounds pretty like standard misogynist to me, honestly, but...

[03:26:19:02 - 03:26:20:11]
Speaker 1
 Okay, Andrew, if you say so.

[03:26:24:11 - 03:26:28:10]
Speaker 3
 Because if women are feminists and you hate feminism, then you hate women.

[03:26:28:10 - 03:26:33:07]
Speaker 4
 No, you hate feminism. Okay. Yeah, so here's the thing, and I can prove it.

[03:26:34:10 - 03:26:48:07]
Speaker 4
 I hate men who are feminists, too. Oh, you're looking at one. Yeah, so here's the thing, if that's the case, then, would that make me a misandrist? I don't think so. What if most men were feminists, which you said is about 80%,

[03:26:49:11 - 03:26:54:04]
Speaker 4
 so then I hate 80% of men by that logic, so I'm a misandrist, right?

[03:26:54:04 - 03:26:55:16]
Speaker 3
 If you hate them for that...

[03:26:55:16 - 03:26:58:27]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, I mean, that's the reason why,

[03:26:59:27 - 03:27:00:23]
Speaker 1
 too. I mean,

[03:27:02:04 - 03:27:13:25]
Speaker 1
 it's because they want to kind of be free. You hate them, and you hate them wanting to be free.

[03:27:15:12 - 03:27:25:04]
Speaker 1
 So, I mean, that's part of it, too. But yeah, if he said that he hated most men, I think that that might be a misandrist as well.

[03:27:26:29 - 03:27:31:04]
Speaker 1
 But I don't know if most men would be called feminists. I mean,

[03:27:32:18 - 03:27:36:15]
Speaker 1
 by his definition, it seems like basically everybody's a feminist, so what are we arguing about?

[03:27:37:22 - 03:27:41:01]
Speaker 4
 For that, yeah, sure. Okay, so then I'm a misandrist and a misogynist.

[03:27:41:01 - 03:27:41:25]
Speaker 3
 Then, yeah, you hate people.

[03:27:41:25 - 03:27:43:09]
Speaker 4
 So I just fucking hate everybody.

[03:27:43:09 - 03:27:47:22]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, I mean, it sounds like it. Oh, so funny.

[03:27:47:22 - 03:27:49:23]
Speaker 3
 I mean, I wouldn't say most men are...

[03:27:49:23 - 03:27:52:18]
Speaker 6
 I just fucking hate everybody. I wouldn't say most men are feminists. You said 80%?!

[03:27:52:18 - 03:27:54:09]
Speaker 3
 I'm granting you're hypothetical.

[03:27:54:09 - 03:27:59:15]
Speaker 4
 You weren't granting a hypothetical? I asked you the question. You said 80% agree with me. No, I don't think 80% are men. And you're a feminist.

[03:27:59:15 - 03:28:09:12]
Speaker 3
 I don't think 80% of men are feminists. Okay, how many? I don't know. I have no idea. I'll throw out a number. I'll say maybe 30%. 30%? Yeah. And how many women? I have no idea.

[03:28:10:15 - 03:28:15:22]
Speaker 4
 Maybe 80. So a lot more? Yeah. And you think that that shouldn't come up during a dating talk, huh?

[03:28:15:22 - 03:28:20:25]
Speaker 3
 I'm not saying it should. I'm saying that you blame feminism, which by default, you blame women.

[03:28:20:25 - 03:28:28:03]
Speaker 4
 So if men and women are in the workplace, men and women are so ideologically split on like almost a 60-20 playing field?

[03:28:28:03 - 03:28:37:28]
Speaker 1
 Okay, so if that is true, women tend to believe in this feminism thing more than men.

[03:28:39:09 - 03:28:43:20]
Speaker 1
 So what? Is that an excuse to hate them more? What's the deal here?

[03:28:43:20 - 03:28:47:23]
Speaker 4
 A playing field? You don't think that's pertinent to dating? I'm not saying that.

[03:28:47:23 - 03:28:53:05]
Speaker 1
 Oh, it's the whole... They're back. Okay, so they've come back full circle. Does this have anything to do with dating or not?

[03:28:54:11 - 03:29:00:23]
Speaker 1
 I mean, maybe a little bit, but this is more like a political thing, I think.

[03:29:01:25 - 03:29:04:25]
Speaker 3
 I'm saying that you blame feminism for the downfall of society.

[03:29:04:25 - 03:29:11:22]
Speaker 4
 Not just feminism. Okay. Yeah. But I do blame feminists for their part of the downfall of society. Yeah.

[03:29:11:22 - 03:29:14:19]
Speaker 3
 Including going to work, including going to college, including all of that.

[03:29:14:19 - 03:29:26:19]
Speaker 4
 No, the idea of separating mothers from children. That was the worst thing they ever did. By going to work and going to college and... That's a terrible idea. Right. Don't you think it's a better... Well, like, why is it a better idea...

[03:29:26:19 - 03:29:31:25]
Speaker 1
 I mean, I think if women could afford to stay home with their kids more, they would.

[03:29:33:03 - 03:29:33:12]
Speaker 1
 So,

[03:29:34:24 - 03:29:44:05]
Speaker 1
 I don't know about that. But, yeah, it's definitely not great that so many of... You know, I don't like how this is turning out.

[03:29:46:18 - 03:29:49:08]
Speaker 1
 I'm just too tired to make good points anymore, and I'm just...

[03:29:51:04 - 03:30:04:25]
Speaker 1
 I'm confused as to what they're trying to say. They're not making sense. I don't know if it's just because I'm tired or if they're really not making sense. So, I might try this again at some point, or I might just do the beginning and jump around to some other parts that seem interesting.

[03:30:06:13 - 03:30:18:23]
Speaker 1
 We'll see. But I think, you know, the one tomorrow says more interesting, so maybe I'll just jump around that a little bit. I've watched most of it already, but I was just listening to it while I was doing other stuff, so...

[03:30:21:11 - 03:30:22:14]
Speaker 7
 Alright, I'm gonna go to bed.

[03:30:26:09 - 03:30:38:00]
Speaker 3
 That's another question to women, what's more attractive looks or confidence in every woman's confidence. Now do looks get you in the door? Sure, but I think a confident man who's average looking has a shot if he approaches or...

[03:30:38:00 - 03:31:11:11]
Speaker 1
 I hear that. Because I've like personal experienced there were men who were more confident that like objectively speaking looking back didn't quite have some of the looks that some other men had but because their confidence was so high like in like a reasonable way not like in a narcissistic way but like a regular like healthy confidence way it really elevated their well everything.

[03:31:13:26 - 03:31:14:27]
Speaker 3
 Which is a woman with confidence?

[03:31:16:08 - 03:31:39:05]
Speaker 1
 Because their confidence level was so high it really got them in the door and it really like I've seen them interact with women and it really like it was really charming like just having the confidence and the charm really makes up for quite a bit like you wouldn't even realize that they were just kind of average looking with the way that you know they carried themselves and that got them far.

[03:31:40:13 - 03:32:03:14]
Speaker 3
 Has some personality, has a sense of humor, he's got a shot. I'm not saying more than the giga chad or whatever they call him but he's got a shot and a lot of women end up marrying those kinds of guys and I think the stats alone speak to it. I think only 14% of the population is over six foot tall or six foot and over but about 50% of households are married. So yeah I mean the numbers speak to themselves.

[03:32:04:18 - 03:32:07:12]
Speaker 3
 Obviously women are marrying guys who are under six feet tall.

[03:32:07:12 - 03:32:30:27]
Speaker 2
 Yeah I would say most people probably a good amount of people in terms of getting married. It's actually if we're talking about socioeconomics they're marrying people or in their socio-economic class. That's pretty typical. On the confidence thing though I mean I don't think there's any dispute even in the red pill space and there's some dispute of whether I even am red pill but. Right.

[03:32:30:27 - 03:33:02:12]
Speaker 1
 Now he brings it up I'm surprised it took him like all the way up until the end to even bring up the whole maybe I'm not even red pill because there were other times when other people have brought up in the show like oh well the red pill the red pill. He's like well I'm not even red pill there you know way over there and I'm not part of that I'm totally over here and they're way over there and now this whole conversation has been kind of presumed that yeah okay we're red pill whatever and now all the way near that he's like well maybe I'm not even part of that but you know I'm just gonna keep going.

[03:33:02:12 - 03:33:26:00]
Speaker 2
 Nobody denies that confidence is a bolster when it comes to attracting women. I think the conversation though is that and this is I don't even think it's a red pill position really it might not be like they're like yeah confidence is really important I think it's more black pill the black pill guys who are like no it doesn't matter like it's all look.

[03:33:26:00 - 03:33:43:08]
Speaker 1
 I mean sure you can I'm sure there's sects of red pill space but I mean collectively you can divide them into other colored pill of sub category or whatever but it's generally the same kind of space.

[03:33:43:08 - 03:34:03:12]
Speaker 2
 Looks yeah heights looks face money all that stuff I mean but they're not totally wrong like if you're really unattractive and you're the most confident guy ever not saying you're not gonna get a girl but like the this idea that confidence is like the cure all forgetting right like it's some.

[03:34:03:12 - 03:34:46:12]
Speaker 1
 You gotta at least be average if you want like really really good results with confidence but average is average like most people are average I mean if you're just like so exceptionally ugly you just gotta be funny at that point or famous or rich but there's there's other ways of you know attracting a mate that looks a few we're not as blessed in that department as you know just average and I mean that's a small subsection of people most people are just kind of average and that's fine if you add confidence average it brings you up to way above average so that's kind of what we're talking about here.

[03:34:46:12 - 03:35:15:10]
Speaker 2
 A magic wand forgetting any woman I don't think that's the case. I agree and the other component though is that I think men who are confident are gonna fare better in person so like an average looking guy right but he's like got good personality and he's confident in person I think he's gonna do well I think he's gonna do well the issue is though is that the majority of people at least from what I've seen are meeting online right so that confidence.

[03:35:15:10 - 03:35:54:25]
Speaker 1
 Yeah I mean that does change things honestly he's got a point there the the whole just seeing a picture and then swiping thing that's been pretty bad for you know getting people together because if you just with one glance decide whether you like a person or not you're not gonna get very far with that unless you have some kind of like super charming like one-liners or you're just have like a really interesting like photos of your life to show that are just like really hook somebody in it's a whole different game that's a good point.

[03:35:56:00 - 03:36:25:11]
Speaker 2
 Finance that personality doesn't really translate yeah and so if people are meeting on Instagram dating apps etc and my understanding from some statistics I've seen maybe it's wrong yeah the majority of people are meeting online at some capacity they're meeting on dating apps so somebody's confidence or personality doesn't really have an opportunity to express itself that's true online yeah these women are swiping on the dating apps yeah they're just looking for a hot dude

[03:36:25:11 - 03:36:35:26]
Speaker 1
 but people people still go outside though I mean people do people go outside so there are still places outside where you could meet somebody it doesn't have to be online

[03:36:35:26 - 03:36:56:03]
Speaker 2
 absolutely they're gonna see the hot guy first yeah and look if he's like a little bitch then yeah he's gonna be in trouble but if he has like a modicum of ability to have a conversation with a woman he's a good-looking and she's already physically attracted to him he's gonna do okay where even if his confidence maybe isn't like exceptional yeah

[03:36:56:03 - 03:37:23:29]
Speaker 3
 I agree and I think that's kind of why I want to encourage men I think that's why I do on the street interviews is because I'm approaching women randomly they have no idea why I'm approaching them I think most of the time they're like pretty they feel pretty comfortable with me but I'm trying to encourage men to do that more because personnel on the dating apps is a losing game you're men outnumber women three to one so they're already on a losing game like there are the dating app I want men to get off the dating apps yeah

[03:37:23:29 - 03:37:51:01]
Speaker 1
 that's good advice I mean unless you're you know bigger chatter or whatever it's it's difficult I guess gotta be difficult as a man to you know get out there and you know just with the picture yeah I mean especially with the numbers game too like it's it's difficult so yeah I mean you definitely probably have better look in real world scenarios especially if you can you know you know carry yourself with the confidence

[03:37:52:21 - 03:38:39:07]
Speaker 3
 and I think they're kind of on the decline I know I think statistically recently more people I agree with that so I'm I want to encourage more people to go meet people in real life because that's when your personality can shine and that's when your confidence can shine that's when your sense of humor can shine and if you feel like I don't have enough money or I don't have enough this is like honestly there are guys at McDonald's that are married there are guys at Walmart that are married there are guys at gas stations that are married and I'm not saying that's the norm but it's possible and I think people can find love and partnership and that's all I'm trying to push for that's really it because I I'm not saying like I'm like a huge natalist but I think there's a common ground in what a lot of the red pill and a lot of these other people think is that at the end of the day we do want to have a thriving population and how do you do that you get people together and right now there's too much of a divide so I'm

[03:38:39:07 - 03:38:44:29]
Speaker 1
 yeah I mean this whole putting up putting men up against women is it's just not working

[03:38:44:29 - 03:39:13:09]
Speaker 3
 trying to limit that divide as much as I can that's that's my mission that's what I'm trying to do and I you know it's I'm brand new to this um but any guy I can reach with that it's like I I know what it's like to not have confidence I know what it's like to feel like you're never gonna date a girl um and it's sad and I don't I hate that feeling for men and I know a lot of men feel that way so um I just want them to not feel like if you don't have six figures six foot six how

[03:39:13:09 - 03:39:18:28]
Speaker 1
 much longer is this I don't know if I can do another like half hours it's just kind of going in circles now I'm kind of repeating themselves

[03:39:19:29 - 03:39:22:28]
Speaker 1
 let's see if it's anything more interesting here

[03:39:22:28 - 03:39:30:23]
Speaker 3
 hit up uh camp uh Herika you might you might get a date you you have a female barber no no no she I have a male barber oh okay she

[03:39:30:23 - 03:39:49:11]
Speaker 2
 was in there she was in there I was talking to either destroy the morale of men who are attempting to fight for custody of their children yeah or to paint a picture of the man as being uh essentially

[03:39:51:08 - 03:40:10:10]
Speaker 2
 really want to fight for his children and then he'll go talk to uh a family a family law attorney yeah and the family law attorney does not have like a good uh prediction for how it's gonna go and that men face

[03:40:10:10 - 03:40:35:00]
Speaker 1
 they've already talked about his area of practice with nothing and what if how you know it's it used to be that women would automatically get custody but it's really changing now and if men fight for their kids they get them so yeah I mean they've already kind of gone through this um I don't know if there's a ton more here I mean

[03:40:36:11 - 03:41:52:23]
Speaker 1
 I'm I'm over it I'm pretty much over it but yeah this one was kind of for the most property time compared to some of the other ones um there were some recent ones that um were a little bit more you know crazy this one I honestly started falling asleep half through so it was okay I mean this guy wasn't great um there were a lot of things he just didn't have answers to but you know he tried to go prepared he gave it he gave it some effort but he didn't really have alternatives for like oh don't don't be in the red pill and it would be nice if he had like at least a list of possible alternatives to like groups that would make you feel like um you know the sense of community that people are looking for uh so to replace that so there's I mean sure it's anything but and I kind of get that point too but it would be nice if he at least offered um if he at least tossed a few ideas out there I think that would have been helpful because they were really able to kind of push him on that and it made him seem like he doesn't know what he's talking about um even though he's not he's not wrong but yeah I mean it was interesting there were a few stats that I was surprised about but

[03:41:53:29 - 03:42:41:24]
Speaker 1
 honestly it doesn't matter too much at this point um like historical facts about like who had what rights when um not not really it was just kind of um splitting hairs at that point of like which looking from our perspective now uh which year women got which right and under what conditions like it's just pretty clear that in the 70s this one we basically had like financially at least um all all of them equally and until then we kind of had to um well not we because I wasn't around but women had to basically deal with all these restrictions that usually stopped them from um making financial decisions unless they went through all these hoops even if they

[03:42:43:10 - 03:43:33:13]
Speaker 1
 went through the hoops they often you know wouldn't be hired or they couldn't open a bank account because of like societal influence not necessarily law so all kinds of things going on there but yeah a few interesting historical facts learned here but otherwise kind of uneventful honestly this one was uh take it or leave it but yeah um I'm glad I was able to skip around a little bit because I don't think I could have sat through the whole thing like this it's just kind of it got so boring there in the middle and even near the end it was just kind of interesting that Brian jumped in but it was it wasn't that interesting either it was just kind of interesting that he was the one talking because usually he sends you know out Andrew or whoever to do it for him but it was interesting to hear him talk for a while there um a rare treat thank you Brian

[03:43:34:14 - 03:43:37:18]
Speaker 1
 so yeah that's uh I'll call it I'll call it a day there I think

[03:43:40:00 - 03:44:19:17]
Speaker 1
 we'll see if I want to do more of these because it seems like I just whenever I kind of hate watch these or whatever fourth wall there's that called this is stupid I'm gonna get this out um so usually when I watch these I just have so much so much I'm thinking like oh wait no that's that's stupid oh don't say that oh that's not true I mean come on and it just it helps me kind of get that out so there's just so many things that I kind of want to say back what that I can't because I'm not there so this is gonna be my way of doing that

[03:44:24:28 - 03:44:50:13]
Speaker 1
 So they couldn't really do anything about being told no women until 1974 when the Equal Court Opportunity Act was passed because there were no anti-discrimination laws about this. So they could just be like, "Oh, if you're unmarried or an animal, you can't open an account here. We don't want you."

[03:44:51:22 - 03:45:05:20]
Speaker 1
 So even if you had a job, you often still just couldn't have a bank account, couldn't take up credit, couldn't take it alone, just for being single. And if you were married, you needed a man until somewhat recently.

[03:45:07:16 - 03:45:09:04]
Speaker 1
 Eighteen-something.

[03:45:11:15 - 03:45:23:24]
Speaker 1
 So there were also assumptions of financial incompetence. So women are emotional, impulsive, and they go about money, which it fuels it too, the whatever podcast. It seems like that hasn't changed.

[03:45:25:08 - 03:46:12:21]
Speaker 1
 And banks, thoughts, and women lacked male supervision, so that was a financial risk. Some banks only allowed accounts if a father or brother co-signed, even for adult women. The whole, you know, infantilizing woman, that hasn't changed much. I mean, have you heard Jim Boba on this channel? And credit files were tied to husbands. So did the 60s credit histories and bank files for married women were often the start under the husband's name. Single women had no way to build credit. The King banks were reluctant to lend more for accounts for them. Yeah, so they basically had their hands tied, even though like legally you could technically do it, but unless you were married, and then it's just a whole mess of things that basically, practically, you couldn't for the most part.

[03:46:14:01 - 03:46:32:22]
Speaker 1
 And it seems like until the 70s, it was very limited. And you're around the 70s is when you can actually guaranteed access. So you could definitely do all these things that the men could, you know, financial banking wise. That's interesting. Okay.

[03:46:35:05 - 03:46:36:25]
Speaker 1
 Let's see what they say here.

[03:46:36:25 - 03:46:59:24]
Speaker 2
 Hold on something about banks anyways here. Let me get through the chat. So it's because we got to try to get this wrapped up soon. But we will get these chats read guys $69 TTS if you want to get it. You know what? Maybe we got to do a little over an hour row session. Hold on. We got Daniel here. Thank you. Ridiculous question. Thank you, Josh Brooks, donated $69 appreciate it brother. Let's get a roasting guys.

[03:46:59:24 - 03:47:03:04]
Speaker 1
 I mean, kind of okay.

[03:47:03:04 - 03:47:17:08]
Speaker 3
 So I didn't know that I didn't know that till just now. I mean, fuck, I just walked into that. Um, so there's a heart to heart here. Okay, I don't know that I can call you directly a misogynist. No, I can't do that. But I do think

[03:47:17:08 - 03:47:19:22]
Speaker 2
 about all this. What about all this Raphael?

[03:47:20:24 - 03:47:23:09]
Speaker 1
 Uh, what about all that?

[03:47:24:19 - 03:47:30:13]
Speaker 1
 I mean, that's just stuff about Red Pillow in general. I don't know if you can call it a specific person that,

[03:47:32:04 - 03:47:39:20]
Speaker 1
 but I mean, just because you may not directly say things like, Oh, I hate women.

[03:47:42:14 - 03:47:59:26]
Speaker 1
 But I mean, the way that he phrases questions and the way that he reacts to certain things like contextual clues tend to lead me to the idea that he may be leaning into a misogynistic direction.

[03:48:04:25 - 03:48:25:21]
Speaker 3
 It's not only you. What is this? A lot of your panel does it a lot of the people on your side do it. It's not just you. I think you're actually a pretty cool dude. So really? Oh, but the thing is, I think the show sometimes does promote that stuff. And I think the guys who are angry find it to be, Oh my God, women do suck. Yeah, I agree with this.

[03:48:25:21 - 03:48:36:18]
Speaker 1
 I don't think Brian disagrees with that, whether he just seems to do it to kind of rage me or for the show or to, you know,

[03:48:38:04 - 03:48:57:11]
Speaker 1
 kind of agree with the audience that he knows has a certain view about women. He doesn't ever seem to disagree for the most part. If it was why he does not disagree with the other male panelists on the show, which are always like very anti women.

[03:48:58:27 - 03:49:03:17]
Speaker 1
 So I don't know. I don't know if I agree with that assessment of whatever this guy's saying here.

[03:49:04:18 - 03:49:09:22]
Speaker 3
 This is the show women do all the worst. I hate them. They have no logic. They're stupid. And I just think that,

[03:49:09:22 - 03:49:29:24]
Speaker 1
 yeah, I mean, I don't know if I, if Brian has ever directly himself said that women are illogical and emotional or whatever, but I wouldn't be surprised if he was quoted saying that I would not be surprised. At least he didn't seem to disagree when others have said things to that, to that effect.

[03:49:29:24 - 03:49:58:23]
Speaker 3
 I think the guys who are already deep red pill, that's what they're going to continue to believe. So that's the only thing I'm trying to do. Dude, I do your show. I, you know, do your thing. I'm just saying I hope that there are men out there that aren't like going deeper into it because studies show they do. That's all I'm trying to, I don't want guys to unalive themselves. It's just the thing. And I'm not saying you're the cause of it, but I'm saying, because they're probably watching other content too. It's not just this, but all of that reinforces it in my opinion.

[03:49:58:23 - 03:50:02:15]
Speaker 2
 You know, I think people who watch my show, Oh,

[03:50:02:15 - 03:50:06:10]
Speaker 1
 he's got his face on.

[03:50:06:10 - 03:50:09:09]
Speaker 2
 Okay. They actually love women more. They love.

[03:50:10:21 - 03:50:31:20]
Speaker 1
 It's hilarious that it seems like he knows, like he's making this into a joke because like he knows that the people are really men who watch the show really don't like women. That's why this is so funny to him. Like, and he's funny to him. I mean, they obviously like, he knows he plays into it.

[03:50:31:20 - 03:51:01:27]
Speaker 2
 Love women more because they, you know, you gotta go into something with your expectations managed. And the blue pill thing is, is you're going to have a sense of what your experience is going to be with dating. But if you go in to dating knowing full well what that's going to entail, then you're not going to be surprised when certain things happen and which will, what

[03:51:01:27 - 03:51:12:16]
Speaker 1
 is he talking about? Like what, what is just like, it's like, he knows exactly what happens in all relationships because they invite a bunch of OnlyFans girls on like what able

[03:51:12:16 - 03:51:37:15]
Speaker 2
 you to have an understanding of women and have a, have your expectations managed. And if your expectations are managed and you don't believe in this Disney fairy tale bullshit when it comes to dating. And I think women have a lot of, this isn't just men's view of women. I think women need to lose the Disney bullshit too when it comes to to men also.

[03:51:37:15 - 03:51:42:12]
Speaker 3
 Yeah, I think they have, I think someone have lofty expectations of what the women have of a dating.

[03:51:42:12 - 03:51:59:03]
Speaker 1
 Sure. Sure. Well, that doesn't, I mean, he started off this whole thing about how it's so funny that, you know, his audience totally doesn't hate women totally doesn't, but like his face says everything like they totally do. Excuse me.

[03:52:01:03 - 03:52:31:09]
Speaker 1
 But now he's trying to go into this whole thing about like trying to rationalize how it's actually, you know, good for them to manage expectations. And I mean, sure. I think there are some expectations about dating on everybody's and like, not just, not just, you know, men thinking it's one thing and something else. Women also think it's one thing. It's like until you experience it, if you change with different people, you don't really know, you don't really know what it's all about. Like it, and you might still not know because it could be totally different with somebody else.

[03:52:32:25 - 03:52:43:24]
Speaker 1
 So yeah, I mean, this isn't like a men versus women thing that, you know, having certain expectations when dating, you might be disappointed. Like, sure.

[03:52:45:06 - 03:52:48:15]
Speaker 1
 Sure. Kind of different from where he started out at.

[03:52:48:15 - 03:52:52:22]
Speaker 2
 Yeah, but I think both men and women have been sold this like Disney fuck.

[03:52:52:22 - 03:52:55:01]
Speaker 1
 Okay, so now it has both. So what's the point of splitting it in the beginning?

[03:52:55:01 - 03:52:59:28]
Speaker 2
 I'd sort of ideal, which is just not realistic whatsoever.

[03:53:01:00 - 03:53:29:04]
Speaker 2
 And so for this reason, I actually think if you're going into dating or your encounters with your girlfriend or whatever it is, with managed expectations, you're not going to end up disappointed because you know exactly what you're getting into. And I think that that makes for a much healthier relationship than having these unrealistic expectations, whether you're a man or a woman, when it comes to dating and relationships.

[03:53:29:04 - 03:53:30:21]
Speaker 3
 I think there's a fair point in what you're saying.

[03:53:30:21 - 03:53:41:18]
Speaker 1
 I think, okay, yeah, I mean, that's, that's fair. But he started out with this like kind of troll thing, and then he went on to something completely reasonable as if those two things are connected, but they're not like, it's just, okay.

[03:53:43:09 - 03:53:53:25]
Speaker 3
 You know, let's dispel the fairy tale that there are people out there that have shitty ideals, shitty preferences. There's shitty people out there. And not every woman's great. Not every man is great.

[03:53:53:25 - 03:53:54:21]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, exactly.

[03:53:54:21 - 03:54:28:11]
Speaker 3
 I think that's okay to say that. But I feel like it's constantly the expectations. Okay, so I'll tell you, I, you know, my tiktok blew up pretty quickly. It's doing pretty good. The comments I get from men constantly, when I asked women, would you date a man under six feet tall? All the women said yes. Every single one I asked, I know what they said, but the common thing I get from every red pill guy who's also single says, watch what they do, not what they say. But I'm interviewing married people. And these people are married to people under six foot. So I'm watching.

[03:54:28:11 - 03:55:01:22]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, I mean, there are plenty of times where even on this show, there were women that say, I'm, I'm, I am married to a man who is, you know, six foot tall, but they seem to only really point out, like, and make a big deal about it when a woman want, like, when someone would happen to prefer somebody taller, they make it to this thing that like, Oh, well, all women are like this, even though they have examples on the show that are not, but they just seem to kind of brush that on the side and just focus on the ones that are, you know, jaloo or whatever it is they say.

[03:55:02:28 - 03:55:14:03]
Speaker 3
 Watching what they do. And but men can't believe it because of what they're hearing in the red pill space. They're hearing that women only want these preferences and that they're never going to get anybody and they're hearing that message over and over again.

[03:55:14:03 - 03:55:40:19]
Speaker 1
 I mean, that's, that's depressing if that happens. But I mean, I could see how that could happen if all you see is stuff like this and all you see is like the women they invite on here and they only focus on the ones that are daloo according to them. Then yeah, I mean, the ones that are somewhat normal that they sometimes have a few, they usually have like one or two that are somewhat normal. And even, even those women, they tend to pick on them for one reason or another.

[03:55:42:04 - 03:55:59:11]
Speaker 2
 Well, I mean, to your point a little bit. So we asked the height question on our show. Sure. And even women on our show, it's not like the super brutal black pills where they're like, Oh, I only want to date a six five giga chat. Right now the women say I've heard it. I'm five seven. I'll date a guy who's five.

[03:55:59:11 - 03:56:00:00]
Speaker 3
 Yeah, I've heard that.

[03:56:00:00 - 03:56:14:17]
Speaker 2
 I'm five foot. I'll date a guy who's five. Sure. You know, they're like, as long as he's taller than me. Yeah. And I don't think that the women are lying necessarily. But I think he

[03:56:14:17 - 03:56:17:11]
Speaker 1
 doesn't think they're lying necessarily.

[03:56:18:13 - 03:56:18:19]
Speaker 1
 Okay.

[03:56:20:16 - 03:56:54:20]
Speaker 2
 You are to some degree misrepresenting the red pill position on this, maybe, which is, I meant, they're not saying that it's perhaps a black pill position. Okay. If you're not six foot, you're just never going to get a girl. I, the red pill position is acknowledging the reality that women have a general preference towards tall men. Do you disagree that generally speaking, women have a preference for taller men, not to say that they wouldn't date a guy who's five nine, but generally, if they had like a choice between the guy who's six three versus the guy who's five nine, absolutely. Probably pick the,

[03:56:54:20 - 03:57:27:14]
Speaker 1
 sure. If they were perfect and you know, perfectly the same and all the other regards, but people aren't like that. And every time they, they ask this question they bring this question to women, they make this hypothetical into a wall. They're perfectly the same and all the other guards are so sure. Obviously, when we would prefer somebody taller, if they're perfectly the same and all the other aspects, but people aren't like that. People are not perfectly the same in all aspects, except this one thing, like that's just not how it works. So really like micro hyper focusing on this height thing.

[03:57:28:28 - 03:57:35:12]
Speaker 1
 And, you know, the framing questions in such a way as to kind of push them into this hole. It's really

[03:57:36:28 - 03:57:43:22]
Speaker 1
 to kind of raise the importance of the height thing. It's, you know, it does mislead people, I think.

[03:57:43:22 - 03:58:16:00]
Speaker 3
 But it's the same way guys would rather have Sydney Sweeney than, you know, some girl they just met on Tinder. Like men have the same kinds of preferences in terms of the extremes. So I totally agree with you that, but I think what happens is men get frustrated that women have those preferences and it makes them feel like they're excluded. And I don't think that's necessarily the case because men follow Instagram models and they think, Oh my gosh, you so hot. This is why I'd rather date, but then they might meet somebody in the street and just because they don't look like that or feel that they don't feel like the attraction. And so I'm saying, you're saying the men don't

[03:58:16:00 - 03:58:22:08]
Speaker 1
 feel attraction to like the regular women or the, I don't get it.

[03:58:22:08 - 03:58:29:10]
Speaker 2
 Feel attraction, right? Towards the women. Correct. Oh, well, I think that's men shouldn't follow. Sure. Prescriptively, I would say mentioned follow like IG models.

[03:58:29:10 - 03:58:32:24]
Speaker 3
 Yeah, but you're right. And I think that's a dangerous precedent for men.

[03:58:32:24 - 03:58:46:06]
Speaker 1
 Like, yeah, I mean, those women are usually just so over, over filtered over Photoshop that it's not a real person. But by like, by the time you see the picture, it's not even a real person anymore. It's just so,

[03:58:48:04 - 03:58:51:04]
Speaker 1
 so edited, like so heavily edited that you're just,

[03:58:52:04 - 03:58:54:14]
Speaker 1
 it's just pixels. It means nothing at that point.

[03:58:55:15 - 03:58:56:14]
Speaker 2
 Like watch porn or

[03:58:56:14 - 03:59:19:06]
Speaker 3
 Yeah, yeah, of course. And I can get behind that. I think porn is setting men up for unrealistic expectations for the world. And so they get upset because they feel rejected, but they see women have these preferences for what they consider giga Chads. And it's like, yeah, if a woman had all the say in the world, she'd probably want to be with that. But the guy she ends up with is probably not going to be that. And you're missing out, I think on great opportunities to meet women and have a good relationship.

[03:59:19:06 - 03:59:38:23]
Speaker 2
 Well, I do want to address your, your, I guess, comment or perhaps criticism of you said that you do these street interviews and the answers that the women give you, you're saying that they're counter to some of the narratives, for example, when it comes to height, right? And the rebuttal that you probably receive is,

[03:59:39:28 - 04:00:01:21]
Speaker 2
 look at women, look at what women do, not what they say, you probably get that all the time. But you think that there's a component of truth there? Like, I agree with you that women aren't aren't just like wholesale lying about every single thing they say. However, I also think that and this perhaps also applies to men too, is that people want to give the answer that sound

[04:00:01:21 - 04:00:15:12]
Speaker 1
 I mean, street interviews are sure. I mean, and then there's a whole editing thing, like, do you do you just pick which ones you like better? Do you like how do you pick who to approach? There's all kinds of issues with it.

[04:00:15:12 - 04:00:30:14]
Speaker 2
 But I'm sure sounds good. Sure. And I think that this men do this too. But I think women do it a little bit more. And so they want to give the politically correct answer the answer that sounds good. Women don't want to,

[04:00:30:14 - 04:00:34:13]
Speaker 1
 I mean, where's the data on that? Like, you're just kind of assuming that

[04:00:34:13 - 04:00:40:18]
Speaker 2
 give an answer that might paint them as potentially superficial,

[04:00:41:18 - 04:01:06:19]
Speaker 2
 or paint them in like a bad light. So they're gonna say, Oh, I don't care about height. But for example, what we've done on the show is, you know, you ask a woman, well, you don't care about height, but we just asked them, Yeah, I've seen how tall of all your long term relationships, how tall have they been? And they're all, for example, not all the time, not all the time, though, to be fair, like sometimes the girl, yeah, I did the guy who's, thank

[04:01:06:19 - 04:01:29:29]
Speaker 1
 you, at least he mentions that it's not all the time. But it's really, like, from what I've seen, at least, they it's usually kind of sprinkled all over the place. It's not even like, sure, there's a few girls that have this pattern of like, just tall people, and they have like, three really tall boyfriends. But for most women, it seems pretty much kind of all over the place.

[04:01:31:16 - 04:01:40:18]
Speaker 2
 My current boyfriend's five, seven, I dated the guy who's five nine. Yeah. But we've also had women who's who are like, well, I'm five four, and I would date a guy who's five, six.

[04:01:41:21 - 04:01:51:10]
Speaker 2
 And then they're like, well, my last three boyfriends were all six foot three. So it's like, well, that's a really small percentage of men in that, in terms of the,

[04:01:52:25 - 04:01:54:01]
Speaker 2
 what's the term?

[04:01:55:08 - 04:02:33:11]
Speaker 1
 And also, like, just three, it could be coincidence. Like, obviously, it seems like there's a pattern there, and it could be preference. But if they would be open to dating somebody shorter, but they just happen to, you know, also meet these tall men, and they have maybe a preference for them, that's, there's nothing really wrong with that. It's not like they're saying, no, I wouldn't date anybody shorter just because they happen to have, you know, met these taller people that they also like doesn't mean if they hadn't met those people and they met somebody shorter, they wouldn't, you know, date them just because they were short, just because they have this history. I mean, that that's not necessarily that doesn't necessarily follow

[04:02:33:11 - 04:02:39:20]
Speaker 2
 percentile. Yeah, the height percentile, like six foot three, you're in like the 99th percentile. Right.

[04:02:40:26 - 04:02:41:13]
Speaker 2
 But again,

[04:02:41:13 - 04:03:02:03]
Speaker 1
 also, I wonder if somebody who is that short, if they have like a perception of men who were say like five nine, they could seem like they're, they're like six three or six four to them. Because if they're that short, they might be like, oh, he's really tall, he must be like six three. But they could just be like, you know, five nine, five eight, like it.

[04:03:03:08 - 04:03:17:03]
Speaker 1
 You never know what these things unless they like physically got there, measured them and you know, meant to also kind of exaggerate height a lot. So you never really know what these things like, they could just be saying that and not know for sure.

[04:03:18:06 - 04:03:19:21]
Speaker 1
 Again, especially if the woman is that short.

[04:03:19:21 - 04:03:46:29]
Speaker 2
 I think women will often say the politically correct and feel good answer to these things. Yeah. And I don't always think that they're honest about it. And they did do a study on this. I can't recall what, but they asked women to compare, I think it was six traits. Yeah. And I don't know if you've seen this. There's this infographic floating around. It was like, what are the like the six most important things I think I've seen this and one of them was like good looks, intelligence,

[04:03:48:07 - 04:03:51:22]
Speaker 2
 money. I can't remember the other ones. And they

[04:03:52:26 - 04:03:57:04]
Speaker 1
 he brings this one up a lot. That's kind of interesting, but it doesn't necessarily

[04:03:58:16 - 04:04:06:00]
Speaker 1
 like mean that all of them are shallow or whatever. And he himself says that looks are important in relationship and attraction is important.

[04:04:07:05 - 04:04:11:17]
Speaker 1
 Basically all the panelists didn't show ever say that. So I don't know what the big deal about that is.

[04:04:11:17 - 04:04:13:15]
Speaker 2
 I'm trying to remember when they

[04:04:14:16 - 04:04:49:03]
Speaker 2
 looks was like at the bottom of their stated preferences, but then I don't recall exactly what the study did, but I think they showed them like images of men or something. Oh, I know the study. Yeah. And then, but, uh, there, so there's, there's a massive difference between their stated preference and their actual preference attraction. Their actual preference was more towards physical attraction as compared to what their stated preferences were. And the other thing, final, I know you want to respond. Last thing on this is just, if you ask women, if they think Lizzo is beautiful, they'll say yes. Right.

[04:04:50:12 - 04:04:53:15]
Speaker 1
 I mean, some women, maybe, um,

[04:04:56:10 - 04:05:11:01]
Speaker 1
 I mean, I don't think so, but I mean, it all depends on like what you think is beautiful. So I think most people would probably not think so if somebody is, you know, that overweight,

[04:05:12:06 - 04:05:14:25]
Speaker 1
 but I thought she was losing weight. So that's good for her.

[04:05:14:25 - 04:05:17:13]
Speaker 3
 But do they really think that I know what you're saying.

[04:05:17:13 - 04:05:44:02]
Speaker 2
 I mean, I don't know if you're a chubby chaser. I don't want to put words in your mouth. I'm just saying, uh, when it comes to physical attractiveness, I think it's a tough sale to say that somebody who's like, I'm not saying this to be insulting towards Lizzo. She's just factually morbidly obese, or maybe she's been losing weight a little bit. I think she has a little bit. I think most, most people when it comes to appraisals of physical attractiveness are not going to say like somebody who's morbidly obese is physically attractive.

[04:05:44:02 - 04:05:44:25]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, that's fair.

[04:05:44:25 - 04:05:49:25]
Speaker 3
 Yeah. Generally speaking, most people wouldn't find that attractive. I hear what you're saying. I mean,

[04:05:51:01 - 04:05:52:08]
Speaker 3
 I got to lose a bit of weight guys.

[04:05:52:08 - 04:05:53:14]
Speaker 2
 I'm getting a little obese.

[04:05:53:14 - 04:06:20:06]
Speaker 3
 We gotta, we gotta cut out that in and out. But, um, no, I think, uh, I think you're on to a lot of things and I, I don't disagree that maybe some of these women are answering this way, but that's why on my long form podcast, I interview married women because I want to interview women who are actually, you know, putting their money where their mouth is. A lot of the women I interview have either said I have dated men under six foot, or one of the more popular videos is which you date a man who earns less money than you. And all but one woman said yes.

[04:06:20:06 - 04:06:24:03]
Speaker 1
 Okay. That's interesting.

[04:06:25:04 - 04:07:04:00]
Speaker 3
 And that woman was, you know, being on it, that one was being honest, which I appreciate. Um, when I did the six foot video, the last woman I interviewed, she was like, well, clearly, and she points to her husband who's like her height, you know, and it's just like, this is great. It's a great, it's a, it's so I do see that women are putting their money where their mouth is now in that study. I, if I remember correctly, they listed the preferences, but then they were showing photos. And I think photos is always going to be a bit superficial. Like I think photos like kind of like Tinder and all that stuff. It's very superficial. I think what makes somebody attractive isn't necessarily just looks, I think looks are the first thing you notice, but I asked,

[04:07:04:00 - 04:07:12:06]
Speaker 1
 yeah, that's true. Cause I mean, if you don't haven't actually spoken to the person, how exactly are you going to rate them except for what you're seeing? That makes sense.

[04:07:18:07 - 04:07:28:07]
Speaker 1
 Alright, well, I tried to keep watching this and, you know, kind of focus on it, front of a point, but I just, I got bored.

[04:07:29:22 - 04:07:55:28]
Speaker 1
 This kind of lost game, it was just, the points were kind of eh, so I put on my headphones, went out to do some gardening and listened to, like, most of the rest of it. Maybe like half of the rest of it, but there's just not that much to say about it. Basically what happened was,

[04:07:57:25 - 04:08:06:06]
Speaker 1
 Andrea kept asking, "Well, is it better to, you know, send your kid off to daycare or, you know, do you want the mother to stay home?"

[04:08:07:18 - 04:08:18:20]
Speaker 1
 Raphael was like, "Well, it depends on the family," stuff like that, and then more about mothers working,

[04:08:20:03 - 04:08:37:13]
Speaker 1
 and there was some stuff about, like, "enso" specifically and what that means. Raphael started bringing up the word "enso" and, you know, just talking about "enso" in general, and she was like, "Well, what's that? What's that?"

[04:08:38:28 - 04:08:47:00]
Speaker 1
 And, you know, he said, "Well, involuntarily sell it," and the intro kept going on about, "Well, can't they just get, you know, a lady of the night?" So to say.

[04:08:49:08 - 04:08:52:07]
Speaker 1
 And yeah, I mean,

[04:08:53:19 - 04:09:00:07]
Speaker 1
 I'm pretty sure it means involuntarily sell it except for, you know,

[04:09:01:07 - 04:09:11:25]
Speaker 1
 just sing it, or the point that Raphael brought up was maybe they can't afford it. I suppose there was not too, but I mean, just get,

[04:09:13:09 - 04:09:16:14]
Speaker 1
 just buy the sex seems kind of,

[04:09:17:20 - 04:09:21:15]
Speaker 1
 I mean, that's not really the answer they're looking for, so.

[04:09:23:06 - 04:09:38:27]
Speaker 1
 Anyway, that was kind of it about that. They just went back and forth about, into definition of "enso," they had this whole big argument about it, about how Andrew wants to play semantics, and yeah, I could kind of see that as, it was stupid.

[04:09:40:06 - 04:09:42:27]
Speaker 1
 And they kept going kind of back and forth and then for a while,

[04:09:44:00 - 04:09:50:10]
Speaker 1
 then they brought up how men unalive themselves more after divorce,

[04:09:51:24 - 04:09:55:11]
Speaker 1
 which is true than, you know, single men.

[04:09:56:18 - 04:10:11:23]
Speaker 1
 And they wanted about that for a bit. Of course it doesn't actually prove that getting married somehow causes that. It's more like loss of relationships, and apparently it's also similar for widowed men, but yeah, so studies.

[04:10:13:22 - 04:10:37:29]
Speaker 1
 Obviously it's not like, oh, you get married and then, you know, she's gonna break up with you, take all your stuff and you're gonna off yourself. That's not really the takeaway there. I mean, I guess you could twist it into a pretzel to make it that, and I'm sure that's what Andrew's implying there, but long story short, there was a bunch of superchats, as per usual, about very nice.

[04:10:39:14 - 04:10:42:28]
Speaker 1
 And more about different Red Pill creators,

[04:10:44:07 - 04:10:56:00]
Speaker 1
 which ones are the ones that matter, and there was some talk about religion where Andrew said that Christianity as well as Islam was

[04:10:57:28 - 04:11:43:06]
Speaker 1
 something that men who do Red Pill can kind of transition out of the Red Pill and go into Christianity and Islam. And Rafiel was like, oh, that's fine. I mean, as long as it's not the Red Pill, if it's dysplasia stuff, I mean, it's not for me, but if that works for you, go ahead. And then she was like, ah, ha, ha, they're just so much less egalitarian than even the Red Pill and blah, blah, blah. So that was basically that. And there was some talk about the gold digger fear of more, it was just kind of just winding down. You could tell it was just losing steam.

[04:11:44:10 - 04:12:28:10]
Speaker 1
 And they basically kind of wound down a little bit. They had some closing arguments, and Andrew was like, I need sleep. And he left. And then surprisingly, Brian took over. I thought that was going to be kind of it, but no, I looked at the timestamps or rather like the bottom timeline bar of it, and it was like two thirds of the way through maybe at that point. So I was like, OK, this is going to be interesting. Usually Brian sent the one that does the debating or the conversation so much he just kind of sends one of these guys like an intro out. But that was kind of interesting.

[04:12:29:20 - 04:12:35:29]
Speaker 1
 So Brian got on and there were some super chats that they read and discussed.

[04:12:37:21 - 04:12:42:01]
Speaker 1
 There was some is it straight to date a trans woman?

[04:12:43:11 - 04:12:50:06]
Speaker 1
 And I feel that he personally wouldn't, but he doesn't really know what to call it.

[04:12:51:16 - 04:13:03:04]
Speaker 1
 It was that. I think they asked this question on their regular panel podcast show pretty much every time. Is it straight to date a trans woman?

[04:13:04:09 - 04:13:11:20]
Speaker 1
 I don't know why they're so obsessed with that particular question, but for some reason, that's like I noticed that's something that's very pervasive.

[04:13:12:26 - 04:13:26:02]
Speaker 1
 And then if they talk about what racism means, or Phil says it's prejudice, prejudice, I can't speak. Or Phil says that racism or sexism is prejudice.

[04:13:27:28 - 04:13:30:18]
Speaker 1
 He says that it is prejudice plus power.

[04:13:31:28 - 04:13:54:29]
Speaker 1
 So that basically that somebody who is oppressed can't be racist. So you have to be kind of above the person in some way. I think he gave the example of basically if there is a black person going to get a job and they get denied because they're black, that would be racism.

[04:13:56:21 - 04:14:04:22]
Speaker 1
 But that's something smaller that would not cause where the person is a sort of power. Like if they're on equal ground,

[04:14:05:25 - 04:14:07:02]
Speaker 1
 then it would just be prejudice.

[04:14:08:04 - 04:14:14:01]
Speaker 1
 So then Brian was like, well, what if it's a female CEO and they refuse to hire a man?

[04:14:15:04 - 04:14:19:06]
Speaker 1
 And Jeffy says, yep, that would be sexist because she would be in position of power.

[04:14:21:05 - 04:14:33:29]
Speaker 1
 So that was basically that they also talked, Brian did this whole thing about who is the primary victim of war. This is something else. That's one of his favorites. It brings it up basically every time he has anything to say about anything.

[04:14:36:12 - 04:15:06:16]
Speaker 1
 This whole going to war thing for Brian is like a dog with a bone at this particular point because he's just so convinced that this one thing about men being drafted into war and going into war, it just kind of, it seems like a lot of rusts on that. So anytime that they discuss like, oh, what a men do in society, what a women do, what are obligations, et cetera, et cetera. And what do, what are men forced to do? What are women forced to do?

[04:15:08:03 - 04:15:13:15]
Speaker 1
 He's always bringing up the war thing, but not even that many men that are going to war like Brian is never going to have to do it.

[04:15:14:21 - 04:15:21:04]
Speaker 1
 There was a podcast a while ago where I really want to find this clip at some point, but

[04:15:22:07 - 04:15:34:28]
Speaker 1
 he basically was bringing up kind of the same point about, well, men have to be, have to sign up for the site of service. They have to go to war. They're the ones that go to war and all these bad things happen to them in war, in a PTSD,

[04:15:36:00 - 04:15:38:01]
Speaker 1
 actual crippling physically.

[04:15:39:08 - 04:15:43:09]
Speaker 1
 And he went on to say that men also just,

[04:15:44:17 - 04:15:56:25]
Speaker 1
 this was a long time ago, so forgive me if this wasn't like the exact context, but I do remember him bringing up also how men's jobs are dangerous and that they are,

[04:15:58:01 - 04:16:04:21]
Speaker 1
 they could cause physical harm to the man more than the women's jobs, as in jobs that women generally go for.

[04:16:05:25 - 04:16:19:00]
Speaker 1
 And he even went on to basically make himself into a victim and try to put himself into this category of men's jobs being dangerous, but has sin annual day causes back pain.

[04:16:20:20 - 04:16:27:15]
Speaker 1
 I am not kidding. And I thought it was a joke, but he was like, no, seriously. And he just, I need to find this clip.

[04:16:29:14 - 04:16:45:02]
Speaker 1
 And then there was the whole selective service thing in this conversation too. How everybody has to register for the draft. Rafael says that basically men are more capable in combat, which is obviously true.

[04:16:46:08 - 04:17:15:28]
Speaker 1
 And Brian was like, well, there's some jobs women can do their support roles, et cetera. I think Rafael went on to say something about, well, what are the men going to do? Oh, the sub brand was like, oh, why don't we just send all the women to war? And Ryan was like, well, I'm sorry. Rafael was like, well, what are the men going to do? And Brian brought up the whole reference to how in Ukraine, people who are not at war are out partying. So that's something about the girls going on and hooking up with men who didn't go to war.

[04:17:18:00 - 04:17:21:27]
Speaker 1
 And that's kind of interesting, like who's going to have the kids during this time period.

[04:17:24:13 - 04:17:52:01]
Speaker 1
 Anyway, Brian just seems very intent on sending women into combat. So honestly, I'm not entirely against that point because I think it might actually prevent war if it was just women who were allowed to go. So that's an interesting kind of from there. Should we just say women have to be sent to war and hope that it does prevent war from happening at all?

[04:17:53:03 - 04:17:57:29]
Speaker 1
 So I kind of like that, honestly, because I think that would be the obvious outcome of that.

[04:18:01:05 - 04:18:10:04]
Speaker 1
 And then they kept going on about war, how it's going to be could be kind of a cyberwarfare.

[04:18:11:21 - 04:18:18:24]
Speaker 1
 But Brian was like, no, look at Ukraine and Iraq. And it's still that people have to go and physically fight.

[04:18:20:09 - 04:18:39:08]
Speaker 1
 There was some talk about conscription, how basically in the 70s it was a small percentage of the population. It was only, I forgot what it was exactly, but it was like under 10% of the population even got drafted.

[04:18:40:21 - 04:18:50:09]
Speaker 1
 It was, I believe, like hundreds of thousands of people, he said. Brian said it was like a few hundred thousand people and that's less than 1% of the male population.

[04:18:52:22 - 04:18:58:24]
Speaker 1
 So that is about how far I got previously.

[04:18:59:28 - 04:19:12:08]
Speaker 1
 And I don't know how interesting it would be to go sort of go back and do a point by point there. But it's, let's see, 31.

[04:19:13:21 - 04:19:27:04]
Speaker 1
 It's only about 10 minutes, so I might as well start. So let's see here, where does that injure leave around?

[04:19:31:07 - 04:19:37:20]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, I mean, this whole, the next few hours here, which is not that eventful, honestly,

[04:19:39:28 - 04:19:43:11]
Speaker 1
 I tried kind of sitting through it, but I was just falling asleep. It was, oh,

[04:19:44:19 - 04:19:51:08]
Speaker 1
 there's a video. It's a video, I don't think I'm going to include it because I was just literally sitting there like,

[04:19:53:10 - 04:19:55:27]
Speaker 1
 I was just dosed off. I was just so bored.

[04:19:57:21 - 04:20:00:10]
Speaker 1
 But it does kind of pick up a little bit.

[04:20:03:27 - 04:20:13:23]
Speaker 1
 Let's see here, because the interesting thing for me is that Brian doesn't usually, like, usually step in. So this is what makes this kind of unique.

[04:20:16:04 - 04:20:21:16]
Speaker 1
 So here is there's Brian, Andrew's gone. So what they're going on about here.

[04:20:21:16 - 04:20:26:07]
Speaker 2
 I think the Vietnam veterans who were drafted, who either are still alive,

[04:20:28:19 - 04:20:44:15]
Speaker 2
 who have PTSD or depression, or who are homeless, whatever it is, or the ones who are dead, you're right. Probably disagree with you. You're right.

[04:20:44:15 - 04:20:57:27]
Speaker 3
 It's a small thing. No, you're right. I shouldn't have said it like that. I'm saying it's a small percentage of the population that is not happening to the vast majority of men. So I think the vast majority of men aren't ever going to be drafted. It's never going to be a thing simply because in the 20s.

[04:20:57:27 - 04:21:11:13]
Speaker 1
 Okay, so this is this is right about the Josh foot. I think where does it start? Over here actually.

[04:21:16:06 - 04:21:27:02]
Speaker 1
 I want to skip the super shots. That's the whole that is got to the straight to trans woman and black people get to be racist towards white people.

[04:21:28:17 - 04:21:34:17]
Speaker 1
 So I'm going to skip that part and see what the hell over here.

[04:21:54:20 - 04:21:58:06]
Speaker 2
 It's going on here about, but you think it's like the counter image.

[04:21:58:06 - 04:22:06:29]
Speaker 3
 No, I think Miss Andrie is probably the closest thing to what red pill ideology is because I don't think there's a necessarily equivalent for women on that side, but I do think that

[04:22:06:29 - 04:22:25:07]
Speaker 1
 okay. I think the question here was what's the cool on the woman's side for the red pill is there like a woman's red pill and that's, that's kind of a good point. I don't think there is anything that women have that's that's anything like the red pill,

[04:22:27:02 - 04:22:44:17]
Speaker 1
 which kind of makes sense because at least in my opinion, the red pill is kind of born out of the rejection that men face. And I just, I think that women happen to be privileged enough to not face as much rejection from the opposite gender.

[04:22:46:06 - 04:22:51:23]
Speaker 1
 So it's, it's just kind of how things are structured. It's not super fair, but it is what it is.

[04:22:51:23 - 04:22:59:07]
Speaker 3
 That my personal definition of feminism, and I think a lot of people's today is just equal opportunity regardless of outcome.

[04:23:00:10 - 04:23:01:16]
Speaker 3
 So that's what I view as feminism

[04:23:01:16 - 04:23:05:28]
Speaker 2
 equal opportunity. Would you be in favor of the draft military draft for women?

[04:23:07:01 - 04:23:10:03]
Speaker 3
 I don't consider that equal opportunity. But what do you mean?

[04:23:10:03 - 04:23:26:16]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, I mean, equal opportunity, I guess it would be yeah. If it was about military service, equal opportunity would be like, can women voluntarily sign up to go to war being drafted? Isn't really an opportunity. That's, that's like a forced conscription kind of thing. I think you have any call opportunity.

[04:23:27:16 - 04:23:31:25]
Speaker 3
 What do you mean? For example, an opportunity would be

[04:23:31:25 - 04:23:42:02]
Speaker 2
 well, yeah, I, I, well, I don't think the draft is an opportunity for men or agreed. Agreed. So I'm not really talking about equality of opportunity, but it would be well, that was his definition.

[04:23:42:02 - 04:23:56:09]
Speaker 1
 So if you have a different definition, I feel like it can't, I mean, he just said, if it's equality opportunity, you're saying, well, this isn't opportunity. So what about it? Obviously it doesn't fit.

[04:23:57:15 - 04:24:00:08]
Speaker 2
 The equality, if both men and women were subject to that.

[04:24:00:08 - 04:24:30:15]
Speaker 3
 But I'm not, I'm not pushing for necessarily full equality. I'm pushing for equal because that's not my definition. My definition is equal opportunity. If a man has the opportunity to do something and a woman is just as capable of doing said thing than do it. Now in my definition, if you're talking about conscription, if a woman is as capable of a soldier as somebody else in the country decides that's what that's, you know, that's what we should go then go for it. But I don't think we should just start drafting anybody. I think it is about, and also for the record, do you know how many, what percentage of men were drafted for Vietnam?

[04:24:32:20 - 04:24:35:26]
Speaker 2
 I think wasn't it like a couple hundred thousand?

[04:24:35:26 - 04:24:46:25]
Speaker 3
 No, but what percentage of the male population? What is this going to be like 1%? At the time it's like 2%. So it's not that big of a thing. And then the 20th century only nine. Hold on.

[04:24:46:25 - 04:24:49:17]
Speaker 1
 That's not that big. That's probably not the best phrasing there.

[04:24:50:22 - 04:25:04:02]
Speaker 1
 I mean, it's still a big deal that people get drafted, but it's not like compared to how many people there are. It was not that many people in comparison to how many, however many people were left.

[04:25:05:15 - 04:25:10:25]
Speaker 2
 I thought your whole thing here though was like, I want to reduce the unaliving rate of men. I want to reduce.

[04:25:10:25 - 04:25:11:25]
Speaker 3
 Let's get rid of conscription.

[04:25:13:16 - 04:25:21:26]
Speaker 2
 Right. But you're saying it's not that big of a thing. I think the Vietnam veterans who were drafted, who either are still alive, who have PTSD or.

[04:25:21:26 - 04:25:24:25]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, that wasn't great phrasing. I don't know if I meant it like that.

[04:25:24:25 - 04:25:30:22]
Speaker 2
 Depression or who are homeless, whatever it is, or the ones who are dead, you're right. Probably disagree with you. Right.

[04:25:30:22 - 04:25:34:01]
Speaker 3
 It's a small thing. No, you're right. I shouldn't have said it like that. I'm saying it's a small percentage.

[04:25:34:01 - 04:25:37:20]
Speaker 1
 Okay. He seems to acknowledge that that wasn't the best phrasing there.

[04:25:37:20 - 04:25:48:04]
Speaker 3
 And as are the population that it just happened to the vast majority of men. So I think the vast majority men aren't ever going to be drafted. It's never going to be a thing simply because in the 20th century only.

[04:25:49:06 - 04:26:16:07]
Speaker 1
 I bet that's just so uncomfortable for Brian to hear because that's that's one of his main arguments is like, oh, women get drafted, men get drafted. That's why women need to bow to them. Because men get drafted and women just get to stay protected. He's never going to be drafted. Not that many men are going to be ever drafted. If any going to be ever drafted at all, at least here in the States,

[04:26:16:07 - 04:26:29:03]
Speaker 3
 really 9% of the total male population has been drafted. So that's still more than I'd like in the, in the 20th century, only 9% of the male population has ever been drafted.

[04:26:29:03 - 04:26:29:29]
Speaker 7
 And that's a lot of men.

[04:26:29:29 - 04:26:32:29]
Speaker 3
 I agree. But it's not the majority and it's not the bad with

[04:26:32:29 - 04:26:46:26]
Speaker 1
 how the world wars were with how big the world wars were. I am surprised that it's that low. I mean, with how big of a deal it was, I really thought it would be more.

[04:26:48:11 - 04:26:51:03]
Speaker 1
 I mean, I kind of get that Vietnam would be not that many comparatively,

[04:26:52:06 - 04:27:05:22]
Speaker 1
 but like the world war, world wars were, I mean, world wars, they were huge. So that's, that's kind of, that's interesting. I didn't know that.

[04:27:05:22 - 04:27:08:07]
Speaker 3
 At the vast majority, it's not even close.

[04:27:08:07 - 04:27:13:05]
Speaker 2
 Well, all men have to register for the selective service. Agreed. So.

[04:27:18:28 - 04:27:30:15]
Speaker 1
 Yeah. I mean, I don't, I don't think they should have to register for the selective service, but you're never, it's, you're not going anywhere. Like Brian, you find most, most men are going to be fine.

[04:27:33:21 - 04:27:34:22]
Speaker 2
 There's inequalities.

[04:27:36:00 - 04:27:42:17]
Speaker 2
 Well I agree with you that there might, we might be in peacetime or there might be periods of peacetime where there's men aren't going to be drafted.

[04:27:44:04 - 04:28:00:13]
Speaker 2
 There are still ramifications for not registering for the selective service. And all men have to register for selective service. One of the big things we're talking about was voting in order to be eligible to vote as a man, you have to register for the selective service failure to do so precludes you from the ability to vote. Sure.

[04:28:00:13 - 04:28:02:08]
Speaker 3
 I don't necessarily see that as an opportunity.

[04:28:02:08 - 04:28:15:24]
Speaker 1
 I wonder if you shares his opinion about voting, if he shares Brian's opinions on, sorry, that is right. I wonder if Brian shares Andrew's opinions on voting that most people shouldn't be voting.

[04:28:17:09 - 04:28:25:23]
Speaker 3
 Portunity. I see that as something I wish we didn't have to do. Well yeah, I'm just talking about equality in general. But I'm not, I'm not really prescribing equality across the board. I'm saying equal opportunity.

[04:28:25:23 - 04:29:12:27]
Speaker 1
 That's interesting. That's, that's gonna, that's gonna be interesting to hear because usually people try to fit into how everything is just equal, but it's, it's a different thing. Like men are different. There's not gonna be perfect equality. It's impossible. Like it just so happens that men can't bear children. And that's, that's a really big deal in the ways that how important it is and how much it just destroys your body. And it's not just your body. I mean your mental health, your career opportunities, all kinds of things. So there's just no perfect equality based, just based on biology. There never will be perfect equality. So you know, how men are stronger.

[04:29:14:05 - 04:29:24:07]
Speaker 1
 There's, it's, it's not equal. It's just not, you can't force it to be because you're just not starting. There's no way to biologically start from an equal place.

[04:29:25:17 - 04:29:51:25]
Speaker 1
 You're just, just based on the facts of the world, of the physical facts of the world, we can't force it to be perfectly equal. So it's nice to hear someone else kind of say it flat out. Like it's not equality, not perfect equality at least. Although I wonder if that's kind of what he means by that. That's kind of my thinking on it, but I don't know. I don't know about him. Let's see.

[04:29:53:16 - 04:30:00:12]
Speaker 3
 So if a man is able to make a decision in his own life to do something and a woman is just as capable of doing the same thing, she should do it too.

[04:30:00:12 - 04:30:09:13]
Speaker 2
 I'll engage with you on equality of opportunity. Women have the opportunity to not be subject to the selective service and force. That's not what

[04:30:09:13 - 04:30:13:19]
Speaker 1
 opportunity means, but okay. I mean, sure.

[04:30:13:19 - 04:30:19:26]
Speaker 2
 Military conscription. I think it seems like an opportunity, right? But sorry, are you in favor of just abolishing the draft entirely?

[04:30:19:26 - 04:30:21:11]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, I would be.

[04:30:22:19 - 04:30:29:18]
Speaker 2
 Ideally, yes. Okay. That's the size to hear. But do you think that that's politically tenable?

[04:30:29:18 - 04:30:33:00]
Speaker 3
 I think so. I think we have a large enough volunteer army and I also think.

[04:30:33:00 - 04:31:16:00]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, and if there are not that many people that I hear that want to keep the draft even on the right and on either side of the political spectrum, I just don't come across many people who are like, yes, the draft is great. We need it. I just don't come across that opinion very often. So I don't think that would be politically a problem. And honestly, it's time. The draft is wrong to force people, even though it's not happening, it's still wrong to force people of any gender and to a service like that where you could potentially die and fighting a war. There's just so many ethical-leading wrong things with it that it needs to go.

[04:31:17:21 - 04:31:21:10]
Speaker 3
 Wars in the future aren't going to be necessarily boots on the ground.

[04:31:22:16 - 04:31:31:02]
Speaker 3
 I think wars in the future are going to be either cyber or they're going to be drones or they're going to be, we have air superiority. I don't think it's going to be boots on the ground unless something crazy happens.

[04:31:31:02 - 04:31:39:08]
Speaker 2
 Let's talk about the two most modern conflicts. So you have the war in the Middle East and then you have the Ukraine war. Are there not?

[04:31:41:17 - 04:31:43:09]
Speaker 1
 Technically those aren't just...

[04:31:45:01 - 04:31:49:01]
Speaker 1
 Those aren't really our conflicts in a very direct way.

[04:31:50:04 - 04:31:56:17]
Speaker 1
 So I think conscription would be more like if somebody literally invades America.

[04:31:57:23 - 04:32:31:27]
Speaker 1
 America. If somebody literally comes over on their boat or whatever, planes, it doesn't matter. If they literally come onto United States soil and try to invade us, that would be related to conscription. But stuff that happens around the world, I don't think that's really super relevant here. But I could see how it's not just all drones ever all the time now. But it is true that a lot of our warfare that United States does specifically directly is...

[04:32:34:01 - 04:32:51:07]
Speaker 1
 Seems to be going in the direction of being more reliant on drones and remote operating machines like that. But other countries may not have cut up as much yet to that. So that's why there's other conflicts happening now that don't exactly look like that yet.

[04:32:53:04 - 04:32:56:20]
Speaker 2
 They're not boots on the ground? Are men not being drafted into these conflicts?

[04:32:56:20 - 04:33:01:16]
Speaker 3
 Sure, but they're not being drafted. It wasn't a draft in Iraq. There wasn't a draft in Afghanistan.

[04:33:01:16 - 04:33:04:19]
Speaker 2
 Well, I'm talking about Ukraine and... I'm talking about the United States.

[04:33:04:19 - 04:33:45:16]
Speaker 1
 Oh, you're talking about... Yeah, I mean, things are different around the world. If you start bringing in the whole global conflicts into the situation, there's so many cultural differences. Just leave the war thing aside for now. Just so many cultural differences in other countries and just across the globe that trying to figure out any kind of pattern for dating and the relation of red pill content to it and bringing war into it. That's just too broad of a thing that you can't generalize for all of that. There's just too many different...

[04:33:48:09 - 04:33:57:27]
Speaker 1
 There are too many different variables in the big pile of global everything. I think the conversation generally seems to center around here in America.

[04:33:59:05 - 04:34:26:13]
Speaker 1
 That's also interesting because every time on the podcast that they have where they bring in a panel of women, usually one of the girls sometimes says, "Well, answer the question of how are women oppressed?" One of the girls would sometimes say, "Well, there are countries in the world where women can't drive, women can't do this, do that." They're like, "Well, we're just talking about the United States obviously. These are the countries whatever."

[04:34:27:16 - 04:34:30:12]
Speaker 1
 Obviously, Brian, these are the countries whatever.

[04:34:31:16 - 04:34:42:04]
Speaker 1
 Interesting how they can bring up other countries when it fits their point, but other people, it's like obviously it's just the states we're talking about.

[04:34:43:23 - 04:34:54:12]
Speaker 2
 Oh, you're talking about the United States? Correct, yes. Okay, yeah, there hasn't been a draft since Vietnam. But in Ukraine, there is forced military conscription and they have done- Which is terrible. Octoman into the streets.

[04:34:54:12 - 04:35:09:10]
Speaker 3
 Yeah, I don't agree to that. Maybe if it's like things are so dire, that's what we have to do. I hope we never get to that point, but in an ideal world, in the US, we have a large enough volunteer army and we have technological advancements that our superior are at.

[04:35:09:10 - 04:35:28:14]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, I think we're okay. Honestly, if things are so bad that it comes to literally drafting Americans, I think we have bigger issues than gender equality at that point. Things are just literally falling apart so badly that I don't think anyone's going to care to argue about stuff like this.

[04:35:28:14 - 04:35:29:20]
Speaker 3
 Or adversaries.

[04:35:31:07 - 04:35:35:04]
Speaker 3
 I don't think it's going to be a boots on the ground war unless something crazy happens to the world.

[04:35:36:17 - 04:35:49:09]
Speaker 2
 Yeah, but so given- So I mean, we can talk about should the draft go away, but since it is a reality, the draft is a reality and we're selective services reality, shouldn't women be obligated to sign up as well?

[04:35:49:09 - 04:35:50:28]
Speaker 3
 I don't think so, no. Why?

[04:35:52:01 - 04:35:57:08]
Speaker 3
 I think because men are more capable and more. That's why. I think that's what you'd rather have.

[04:35:57:08 - 04:36:25:29]
Speaker 2
 Yeah, but I mean, so I saw a stat and maybe somebody in the military in the chat can weigh in. In order to field one combat soldier, you need 10 support roles in the military. So if you want frontline combat soldier, you need 10 people in support roles administration to enable that one individual on the frontline. So there are roles that women could serve in the- Look, even if women-

[04:36:25:29 - 04:36:43:04]
Speaker 1
 That's true. I mean, there are plenty of roles in the military that don't actually involve going out and physically fighting anybody or there are roles that don't involve heavy lifting or any other physically strenuous exercise kind of thing. But they're still-

[04:36:44:12 - 04:36:52:28]
Speaker 1
 I mean, if the premise says, "Well, the draft has to exist, should we have both men and women be drafted?"

[04:36:54:15 - 04:36:59:00]
Speaker 1
 I don't know. I'd rather not exist at all, but it would-

[04:37:00:00 - 04:37:36:17]
Speaker 1
 I don't know. Honestly, I could see both sides of the argument here because in one hand, Cher would make it more equal. But then again, men and women just aren't equal like that. They're equal in some ways, but we're just too different to be completely equal in all the ways. So I don't know about that, honestly. There are definitely issues with it. Like if we start drafting women who's gonna be raising the next generation, who's gonna be having kids. Obviously, you can't have kids if you're in war.

[04:37:38:26 - 04:37:43:18]
Speaker 1
 I don't know how I feel about that. I could go either way on it. I'm just not sure, personally.

[04:37:44:26 - 04:38:01:00]
Speaker 2
 Men were subject to force military conscription. It's probably unlikely that they would encounter frontline combat. I personally think that's still unequal. I guess I would accept that they should at least be subject to force military conscription, but there's plenty of roles in the military that women can...

[04:38:03:02 - 04:38:04:25]
Speaker 2
 Pencil pushers. Sure. Pencil pushers.

[04:38:04:25 - 04:38:07:02]
Speaker 3
 Well, here's what I'll say. I think men should...

[04:38:07:02 - 04:38:08:03]
Speaker 1
 Yes, send them to the kitchen.

[04:38:09:12 - 04:38:20:24]
Speaker 3
 Should still be the primary people that have to serve. I mean, again, if I could get rid of the draft, I would. If we had just a volunteer army and technological investments to combat our enemies, but should a draft...

[04:38:20:24 - 04:38:25:27]
Speaker 1
 I like that. I really... I do hope that we get rid of it at some point soon.

[04:38:27:22 - 04:38:33:23]
Speaker 1
 It just ethically not okay with me. Whether it's men, women, whoever, it's just not okay.

[04:38:35:06 - 04:38:48:07]
Speaker 3
 If something terrible happens and we have to draft, I still think primarily let's draft men because they're more capable at combat and in the front lines. But if we desperately need the help and women can be in the support role, then maybe that's a discussion to have.

[04:38:49:12 - 04:38:53:29]
Speaker 2
 Honestly, I think we should just draft women for frontline combat.

[04:38:56:01 - 04:39:12:24]
Speaker 1
 I know this is supposed to be rage bait or whatever, but I think deep down he probably means it. He just... He wants women to die. I would not be surprised. You just like send them off. I hope they all get killed.

[04:39:14:20 - 04:39:16:02]
Speaker 1
 That's probably...

[04:39:17:23 - 04:39:30:19]
Speaker 1
 Probably what's going on here. Obviously, I can't know for sure, but there does seem to be a kind of disdain for women in the air over in this area of the room.

[04:39:33:22 - 04:39:34:28]
Speaker 3
 I don't think that's a good idea.

[04:39:36:29 - 04:39:38:17]
Speaker 2
 That's kind of sexist of you.

[04:39:38:17 - 04:39:41:17]
Speaker 3
 I don't think I'm preventing this.

[04:39:41:17 - 04:39:45:04]
Speaker 2
 That's kind of misogynist. You don't believe in strong independent boss babes?

[04:39:45:04 - 04:39:55:01]
Speaker 3
 I do. And if there are women in my definition of feminism, if there are women who would like to go to the front lines because they feel capable enough, then go for it. But I'm not saying they should be forced to.

[04:39:55:01 - 04:39:57:23]
Speaker 2
 I think I honestly... Yeah, I mean,

[04:39:58:27 - 04:40:08:13]
Speaker 1
 obviously, there's this such rage bait. He's still gonna go on about it, isn't he? He does this thing where he just keeps going on about things that are obviously rage bait.

[04:40:08:13 - 04:40:17:08]
Speaker 2
 Gatham? It's kind of like we've had hundreds, hundreds, thousands of years of forced military conscription for men, maybe just like test it out for like a century.

[04:40:17:08 - 04:40:28:22]
Speaker 1
 That's convenient just when it happens to be that it's your turn, now make the women do it and somehow act like you've already done it when you personally haven't.

[04:40:28:22 - 04:40:31:20]
Speaker 2
 Just send the women to war. You're not serious though, right?

[04:40:31:20 - 04:40:36:25]
Speaker 3
 And televise it. And we should televise it. You're not for real, right? This isn't for real. I mean...

[04:40:36:25 - 04:40:43:19]
Speaker 1
 I don't think it's true. I think this is rage bait, but I don't think he would hate to see it.

[04:40:44:24 - 04:40:57:15]
Speaker 2
 I mean, look, if this idea that men are better suited for war... Yeah. Yeah, you're right. But what if everybody just... We all agreed, "Eh, let's just let the women do a bit of the fighting for a century."

[04:40:58:28 - 04:41:01:27]
Speaker 2
 It's just women versus women, so it's kind of... And see, this is the

[04:41:01:27 - 04:41:13:00]
Speaker 1
 part where I'm like, "Okay, yeah, I mean, that might actually turn out well because I think if everybody has to send their women off to fight, nobody is going to want to actually start war."

[04:41:14:19 - 04:41:20:12]
Speaker 1
 So I kind of like that. If that basically means no more war, then sure.

[04:41:22:00 - 04:41:33:01]
Speaker 2
 Kind of, you know. Oh, I see what you're saying. It's not women versus men. "Worces across the board." Like, I think for the equality of opportunity, we should allow women to have post-traumatic stress disorder and...

[04:41:33:01 - 04:41:41:19]
Speaker 1
 The problem with that is if somebody calls somebody's bluff and the women do actually have to go and fight wars,

[04:41:43:12 - 04:41:43:18]
Speaker 1
 basically,

[04:41:44:19 - 04:41:48:24]
Speaker 1
 civilization collapses because they're not going to be having kids.

[04:41:50:24 - 04:41:55:17]
Speaker 1
 How do you have a kid while you're at war? Yeah, I mean...

[04:41:56:27 - 04:41:57:25]
Speaker 1
 And that just doesn't work.

[04:41:59:16 - 04:42:06:05]
Speaker 2
 You know, just like get a artillery shell in the gullet. I'm in favor.

[04:42:06:05 - 04:42:13:21]
Speaker 1
 What would the men... It's like he's salivating at the idea of imagining women physically hurt. That's kind of disturbing.

[04:42:13:21 - 04:42:14:29]
Speaker 3
 What are we doing?

[04:42:15:29 - 04:42:31:29]
Speaker 2
 We would be... What are the women doing in Ukraine? We'd be on Tinder, sleeping with the women who didn't get drafted. We would be kicking it. We'd be kicking it. We'd be mowing lawns and shit. And...

[04:42:33:15 - 04:42:36:15]
Speaker 3
 I mean, that is an interesting hypothetical, but... You're not...

[04:42:38:04 - 04:42:38:21]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, I mean...

[04:42:39:25 - 04:42:42:06]
Speaker 1
 Is he actually going to try to take it seriously?

[04:42:43:19 - 04:42:55:15]
Speaker 3
 For it? I'm not. Because again, my loose definition of masculinity is doing the right thing because it's the right thing and I think men... Yeah, what's the right thing? The right thing in this situation is protect women. That's what I feel like.

[04:42:55:15 - 04:42:58:04]
Speaker 2
 Protect women? Yes. I think the right thing...

[04:42:58:04 - 04:42:58:28]
Speaker 1
 Protect women?

[04:43:00:11 - 04:43:03:28]
Speaker 1
 Protect women? Oh no. Oh no, he's going to have a problem with that.

[04:43:03:28 - 04:43:10:12]
Speaker 2
 Something would be in the event of a war, all the countries just agree. All the countries agree. Okay, we're just going to have women.

[04:43:11:13 - 04:43:18:28]
Speaker 2
 We're all feminists now. We're going to have the women fight. Just test it out. But we get to televise it too. I mean, we already do that with the war.

[04:43:18:28 - 04:43:19:26]
Speaker 3
 I just...

[04:43:19:26 - 04:43:31:17]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, we're just kind of... I mean, I'm on one hand glad that people get to see it more if they want to and more information out there about it.

[04:43:32:24 - 04:43:36:02]
Speaker 1
 But on the other hand, it's a little bit... It can be disturbing.

[04:43:38:19 - 04:43:46:11]
Speaker 3
 I just don't think that's necessarily feminism. I mean, here's a loose example. It's a terrible example. It's like super feminist. The women get to fight. No, it's an equal opportunity. It's not...

[04:43:46:11 - 04:43:47:23]
Speaker 2
 It's an equal opportunity to die in shit.

[04:43:47:23 - 04:43:51:21]
Speaker 3
 That's not an opportunity. You don't want... That no one thinks being the front line is a prison opportunity.

[04:43:51:21 - 04:43:57:14]
Speaker 2
 You don't want equal opportunity for women to die? No, I certainly don't. That is misogynistic, sir. I want...

[04:43:57:14 - 04:44:00:15]
Speaker 1
 So, so very misogynistic, wow.

[04:44:01:17 - 04:44:07:07]
Speaker 2
 I want you to apologize to all the women watching that you don't want equal opportunity for women to die.

[04:44:07:07 - 04:44:17:05]
Speaker 3
 So the way I see it, and this is a stupid example, but it's the first one that came to mind. If you're on an airplane and you see someone struggling to put their suitcase up, do you get up and do it?

[04:44:18:06 - 04:44:19:09]
Speaker 1
 I don't think he does.

[04:44:20:28 - 04:44:39:12]
Speaker 1
 I mean, he's gonna have to say yes here because like what kind of a-hole would be like, no, but I don't think he would be one of the ones hoping. I think he would just kind of like either watch or look away, but I don't think he'd get up and start helping. Maybe if it's somebody like, if it's like,

[04:44:40:13 - 04:44:43:16]
Speaker 1
 I don't know, I don't know who he would even help.

[04:44:45:04 - 04:44:46:13]
Speaker 2
 If I see somebody struggling?

[04:44:46:13 - 04:44:48:14]
Speaker 3
 Yeah. I'll indicate.

[04:44:48:14 - 04:44:51:25]
Speaker 1
 He's gonna have to really think about this. Like, how do I say this? Do I say it?

[04:44:51:25 - 04:44:53:02]
Speaker 3
 Carry on.

[04:44:54:22 - 04:44:55:21]
Speaker 1
 What? I don't...

[04:44:55:21 - 04:44:56:10]
Speaker 3
 I'm just asking.

[04:44:56:10 - 04:45:01:01]
Speaker 1
 Do we... It's such a difficult question, Brian. Such a difficult question. Do you help? Do you help or not?

[04:45:01:01 - 04:45:02:12]
Speaker 3
 Do I do it?

[04:45:02:12 - 04:45:02:27]
Speaker 1
 Do you?

[04:45:02:27 - 04:45:03:17]
Speaker 3
 And you see someone struggling?

[04:45:03:17 - 04:45:10:03]
Speaker 1
 Do I do it? What should I say here? I know it's a no, but what should I say?

[04:45:11:10 - 04:45:11:23]
Speaker 1
 Old lady.

[04:45:11:23 - 04:45:16:13]
Speaker 3
 I'm not even... I'm not even saying anybody. I'm not even saying a gender. I'm not saying...

[04:45:16:13 - 04:45:19:08]
Speaker 1
 Okay, so an old lady, he might help, but...

[04:45:21:05 - 04:45:23:04]
Speaker 1
 He's saying anybody. Ugh, what do I do?

[04:45:24:05 - 04:45:24:28]
Speaker 3
 Anything. Yeah, sure.

[04:45:24:28 - 04:45:30:02]
Speaker 1
 If someone is struggling? Sure, sure, I'll help. Whatever. Whatever, I'll help. I don't think he would.

[04:45:31:05 - 04:45:38:23]
Speaker 1
 Somebody who would help would be like, "Yeah, sure." Like right away. There would not be this whole thing about it.

[04:45:38:23 - 04:45:44:23]
Speaker 3
 I'll help. That's kind of how I feel masculinity is. I'm capable enough to do this thing. I should do it.

[04:45:44:23 - 04:45:53:15]
Speaker 2
 That's how I feel. I think we should help women get drafted into the military and let them do a bit of the dying. I don't believe you do.

[04:45:53:15 - 04:45:57:12]
Speaker 1
 I'm still holding up on this whole women have to die thing. It's kind of disturbing.

[04:45:58:17 - 04:45:59:26]
Speaker 2
 I think the women should do a bit of the dying.

[04:45:59:26 - 04:46:00:26]
Speaker 3
 Are you doing the Trump hands?

[04:46:01:29 - 04:46:02:29]
Speaker 3
 Are you using your Trump hands?

[04:46:02:29 - 04:46:05:08]
Speaker 1
 He is doing Trump hands. I just noticed that.

[04:46:06:25 - 04:46:07:19]
Speaker 1
 That's kind of endearing.

[04:46:07:19 - 04:46:08:17]
Speaker 2
 Okay.

[04:46:09:18 - 04:46:22:25]
Speaker 2
 I think we should have some of the women do a bit of the dying just to equal it out a little bit. You know, a little bit of shell shock, a little bit of mortars. Let them experience some mortars. Trench war.

[04:46:22:25 - 04:46:32:19]
Speaker 1
 He's really like this, this picturing women dying thing. It's just like, he's just so into that.

[04:46:32:19 - 04:46:44:08]
Speaker 2
 Fair trench for all the different ways. There's back in Ukraine. They got trenches. You see the drones dropping the grenades. You seen that? Yeah. Let's maybe look equal. Let's get women to do it.

[04:46:44:08 - 04:46:46:08]
Speaker 3
 I don't, I don't agree.

[04:46:47:15 - 04:46:47:28]
Speaker 3
 I don't agree.

[04:46:47:28 - 04:47:03:09]
Speaker 2
 Have you gotten the real fat? I'm the actual real feminist here. You seem like a bit of a red pill podcast bro with your, you know, men are supposed to, men are supposed to protect women. That's very, you know,

[04:47:03:09 - 04:47:09:04]
Speaker 3
 I think, I think men should protect the innocent and I think men should protect people that can't protect themselves. That's what I believe.

[04:47:09:04 - 04:47:13:19]
Speaker 1
 Okay. So men should protect the innocent and people who can't protect themselves.

[04:47:15:02 - 04:47:43:14]
Speaker 1
 I mean, sure. I mean, as a person who's not a man, I don't mind that definition of like who should men should protect if, but then the whole like should men protect. It seems like men agree that they should, but I don't know. That's kind of a different question here. So look at Brian's face here, protect the innocent and people who can't defend themselves. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. How are we going to try this into men should not protect women?

[04:47:45:14 - 04:47:47:29]
Speaker 2
 So the women are the innocent and the men are what? The devils?

[04:47:47:29 - 04:48:05:06]
Speaker 1
 No. He's really like latched onto this whole innocent thing. He said innocent and people who can't protect themselves. So there's two categories there. I'm assuming by innocent, he meant like children and people who can't protect themselves. So it would also be like women and children, maybe like the elderly.

[04:48:06:27 - 04:48:16:10]
Speaker 1
 So he's really latched onto this. He heard the word innocent and he just got like triggered in the context of women could be innocent. Oh no.

[04:48:17:14 - 04:48:18:28]
Speaker 1
 I have a problem with that.

[04:48:20:20 - 04:48:29:28]
Speaker 3
 No if I'm the man, I'm not saying men are, I'm not giving a judgment on men. I'm not giving a judgment on anybody necessarily, but if somebody can't defend themselves, I think men should. That's all men.

[04:48:29:28 - 04:48:36:25]
Speaker 2
 Men should. Yeah. No, but that's what I'm saying with the war. We just make that shit all women. We have a United. He's still on this.

[04:48:36:25 - 04:48:38:09]
Speaker 1
 Oh geez.

[04:48:39:19 - 04:48:48:28]
Speaker 1
 I'm going from this already. This, this, this. He has this thing about just like really drawing out the rage by just stretching it out.

[04:48:48:28 - 04:48:56:28]
Speaker 2
 The nations, we have them agree. Okay. For the next hundred years, all the men, you know, they're not going to fight. We're going to send the women to fight.

[04:48:58:22 - 04:49:02:23]
Speaker 2
 I think that you're not on board with that. Do you get on board with that?

[04:49:02:23 - 04:49:09:07]
Speaker 3
 That would be, I'm not. Do you think that would be good for the general population and inter?

[04:49:09:07 - 04:49:22:15]
Speaker 1
 Yeah. Who's going to have all the kids? I mean, you're basically going to be missing a whole generation of children. That's going to, I mean, even though when people are having just less children already,

[04:49:23:16 - 04:49:46:08]
Speaker 1
 and it seems like there is risk of society falling apart just because there's not going to be enough young people to take care of the old people, add on women going to war instead of men on top of that, the already declining birth rates. That's a nightmare. That's complete society collapse. I mean, what is he,

[04:49:47:19 - 04:49:48:25]
Speaker 1
 this is getting kind of old.

[04:49:50:04 - 04:49:53:20]
Speaker 3
 In terms of us, you know, continuing our population. Do you think that would be a good thing?

[04:49:53:20 - 04:50:10:27]
Speaker 2
 Yeah, it'd be good. Okay. It'd be good. Okay. Yeah. You know, what would that be good? You send, you send the feminists to fight, send the feminists to fight or send the anti-natalist. Because like you look, if you're a woman and you're pregnant, you can, you can get out of it.

[04:50:10:27 - 04:50:36:01]
Speaker 1
 Okay. So he has some exceptions here, for women who are already pregnant. But what about the ones that are going to be pregnant later? I mean, it seems like he's now he's saying only feminists and people who are anti getting pregnant. So, but by his definition, basically everybody's a feminist except for a very niche like section of red pill people.

[04:50:37:10 - 04:50:49:03]
Speaker 1
 So that would be basically everybody. Like anytime someone gets on and she's like, no, I'm not a feminist. They start questioning her and being like, Oh no, you're a feminist. You're a feminist. You're a feminist. Like, Oh, you're, you're totally, you're feminist.

[04:50:51:10 - 04:50:55:03]
Speaker 3
 But don't you want women to be getting pregnant during this time?

[04:50:55:03 - 04:51:00:14]
Speaker 2
 Yeah. I mean, look, we're going to put a cap. Only 10%, only 10% of the women.

[04:51:00:14 - 04:51:02:16]
Speaker 1
 The story keeps changing.

[04:51:03:17 - 04:51:09:08]
Speaker 1
 You can go poster. You know, just really narrowing things down. Okay.

[04:51:09:08 - 04:51:14:12]
Speaker 2
 Can fight. That's it. We won't send more just 10%. That's it.

[04:51:14:12 - 04:51:18:23]
Speaker 3
 That's a weird rule when you're having a war where you're like, Hey, we're only going to send 10% of our troops. You guys.

[04:51:18:23 - 04:51:34:13]
Speaker 1
 Yeah. I mean, if it comes down to things are so bad that we have to conscript people into war. If we have this rule of 10% our enemies are going to know that we basically have a cap and they can plan around that. That's how I was going to work.

[04:51:35:21 - 04:51:39:02]
Speaker 3
 You guys agree to that? I don't, I just don't think that works. I mean, again, I don't think anyone

[04:51:39:02 - 04:51:47:20]
Speaker 2
 would do this in this hypothetical. 10% of the population. So just why, but don't you think we should send women? I don't, I don't.

[04:51:47:20 - 04:51:53:29]
Speaker 3
 I don't. I just don't, because I don't think that they're capable. I think men are more capable in war. Men are more capable in war. Yes.

[04:51:53:29 - 04:51:58:29]
Speaker 2
 Okay. Obviously. All right. We got some chats coming through, but I got some more. Oh, finally.

[04:52:01:24 - 04:52:05:02]
Speaker 1
 I

[04:52:05:02 - 04:52:27:08]
Speaker 2
 got some more things I want to talk to you about. Okay. All right. Let me let some of the chats through. Sorry for the delay guys, but I'm sitting next to a misogynist who doesn't want women drafted and it's really frustrating. I'm really upset by this whole, you know, this, the sexism is just, I feel the sexism coming from you, man. It's a little, it's a little upsetting to me, but I'm really upset. It's really.

[04:52:27:08 - 04:52:37:27]
Speaker 8
 It's donated $69 dude. With the exception of UNIX soy boy lives as your target audience, you have absolutely not a chance in hell in changing any.

[04:52:37:27 - 04:52:49:22]
Speaker 1
 I always hear this specific person doing the super chats and the text to speech thing they have here, just like constantly sending in stuff.

[04:52:52:21 - 04:52:57:16]
Speaker 8
 Man's mind. Red pill plus Christian ethics equals society's salvation.

[04:52:58:22 - 04:53:00:23]
Speaker 3
 I already have changed people's minds, but that's okay.

[04:53:03:14 - 04:53:03:29]
Speaker 2
 You know what?

[04:53:05:00 - 04:53:05:17]
Speaker 2
 Oh wait, nevermind.

[04:53:05:17 - 04:53:08:27]
Speaker 8
 Okay. Selena Gorn is donated $69.

[04:53:09:28 - 04:53:16:23]
Speaker 8
 The red bill is the alternative. It's the rejection of do what you want all the time. And that is what is the other one.

[04:53:16:23 - 04:53:25:12]
Speaker 3
 He's like a hound mix. A hound. Yeah. That's very red pill. You inherently have duties just because you're. I don't know.

[04:53:25:12 - 04:53:50:17]
Speaker 2
 I don't want to keep going. But I mean, so every single all or all men had the right to vote and women didn't. I don't remember. I don't know. Yeah. I think it's, uh, I could be off by a couple of years, but I believe it's 50 years. That's a period of time between when men, all men or almost all men had the right to vote and all women had the right to vote. Before that, most men, most women, they didn't, they couldn't vote. Right.

[04:53:50:17 - 04:53:56:24]
Speaker 1
 I see that right when it was basically just landowners who could vote. Is that what this is about?

[04:53:56:24 - 04:54:02:21]
Speaker 2
 You had, you had small groups of concentrated power. You had monarchies, very small people.

[04:54:04:00 - 04:54:20:07]
Speaker 2
 Voting is a really super new. Sure. Past couple hundred years. Yeah. You go back even 200 years. Most men can vote. Most women can vote. The way that men, uh, got the right to vote is because they had to go to war. Yeah.

[04:54:20:07 - 04:54:21:22]
Speaker 3
 At a point in time. Yeah. Yeah.

[04:54:21:22 - 04:54:22:12]
Speaker 2
 Right. Like if you,

[04:54:22:12 - 04:54:24:04]
Speaker 1
 I mean,

[04:54:25:14 - 04:54:42:10]
Speaker 1
 is that really why men got the right to vote? Because they had to go to war because men had to go to war for all of these past previous years that he was talking about too. Like, you know, hundreds and hundreds of years ago, men still had to go to war. That doesn't mean they got the right to vote then. So what is, what is he on about here?

[04:54:42:10 - 04:54:49:14]
Speaker 2
 If you look at, so women got the right to vote in 1920, right? What happened just before then?

[04:54:49:14 - 04:54:50:14]
Speaker 7
 World war one.

[04:54:50:14 - 04:55:17:02]
Speaker 2
 World war one. And so it's interesting conveniently for, for women and I suppose feminists that they got the right to vote right after the most, at least at the time, world war two had higher casualty count. Although you could argue that in many ways world war one was much more brutal in, in, in many ways, the trench warfare and the soldiers were on the front for way longer than, you know.

[04:55:17:02 - 04:55:28:14]
Speaker 1
 World war one, I don't know as much about it as I do world war two in general. I'm not really a history buff, but I mean, that was, that was brutal.

[04:55:29:21 - 04:55:42:14]
Speaker 1
 Sometimes I just think about it and I can't believe that so, so many people just died like that. That's, that's, that's really sad.

[04:55:44:07 - 04:55:51:28]
Speaker 1
 And then they did it again a few years later with world war two. Like that's just sometimes I just don't get it.

[04:55:53:02 - 04:55:56:01]
Speaker 2
 You know, they'd be like in perpetuity on the front.

[04:55:57:04 - 04:56:03:25]
Speaker 2
 Whereas like in world war two, they took, they'd shift out and it was a bit different, but it was world war two was also really bad of course.

[04:56:05:12 - 04:56:17:08]
Speaker 2
 But the, the most barbaric war that had ever been seen up until that point, most casualties, etcetera, women conveniently secured the right to vote right after it because one of the concerns of the suffragists,

[04:56:17:08 - 04:56:21:09]
Speaker 1
 what does she mean conveniently right after it? Like what does that mean?

[04:56:21:09 - 04:56:37:21]
Speaker 2
 See if he explains that. That's was, well, if we secure the right to vote as women, we're going to be subject to to military conscription. Feminists were able to secure the right to vote without any corresponding responsibility and that responsibility duty would be having to go to war.

[04:56:38:21 - 04:56:42:09]
Speaker 2
 And so, I mean, and again,

[04:56:44:06 - 04:56:47:17]
Speaker 2
 men got that because they had to basically be willing to die.

[04:56:47:17 - 04:56:48:03]
Speaker 7
 Yeah.

[04:56:48:03 - 04:56:53:10]
Speaker 3
 They had to be at one point it wasn't that it's not something. Well, at one point it was also land ownership and things like that.

[04:56:53:10 - 04:57:05:19]
Speaker 1
 Yeah. I mean, men got, I kind of understand when he's going here with the historical context, but men got sent to war for, well, all of our written history, basically.

[04:57:07:27 - 04:57:12:21]
Speaker 2
 There are other differences too, but I mean, this idea though that women.

[04:57:12:21 - 04:57:26:13]
Speaker 1
 And I'm sure this one was like exceptionally brutal, but I mean, just being sent off to die didn't, it never meant you got to vote. So you know, what else changed here? Because obviously something else changed.

[04:57:26:13 - 04:58:06:05]
Speaker 2
 That men for like millennia had like all men. I will actually grant to you that like throughout most of human history, the men, which by the way, was a very, very small percentage, like 0.001% of men had power. The rest were like the peasant. Yeah. Yeah. The peasantry class oppression too. Right. But so like the top apex of men, yeah, they're the ones who did have power, but like that doesn't speak to the 99.99% of men who were just as oppressed and who had honestly, I would argue throughout history, at least my big argument here was, is as it relates to warfare, women.

[04:58:06:05 - 04:59:02:05]
Speaker 1
 Okay. So he's, what is, what is he saying? No, that there for most of history and I mean, now also it, there's only a small percentage of people who are in power, but he's specifying it as like men. So for all of this time in history, there was a small percentage of men specifically who are in power and the rest of men specifically were basically had no power, which is true. But you know, even now, like most of women don't have power either. There's a very few, very few women are in actual positions of power, just like very few men in positions of power. This whole dividing everything into a man and woman is kind of silly there. I mean, we're, we're all basically very little power for most of us. There's very few people that actually have tons of men have been

[04:59:02:05 - 04:59:12:06]
Speaker 2
 shielded by the barbarity of war. Absolutely. Women have been shielded for having to participate. They're protected. Typically at least, you know, your own civilization.

[04:59:12:06 - 04:59:13:03]
Speaker 1
 Oh no.

[04:59:14:12 - 04:59:22:10]
Speaker 1
 Women are shielded. That's, must be so terrible for him to even think about women being shielded from war. We got to make sure they get beat up, right?

[04:59:23:23 - 04:59:28:08]
Speaker 2
 In your own population, your own nation, your own society, women are, are protected.

[04:59:28:08 - 04:59:28:29]
Speaker 8
 Yeah.

[04:59:28:29 - 04:59:29:18]
Speaker 2
 Are protected.

[04:59:29:18 - 04:59:57:00]
Speaker 3
 And so I mean, I see what you're saying. I I'm not denying that men have been oppressed. There's obviously been oppression of men as well. I think though, as time progressed, men got more and more privileges that women didn't same with minorities. You know, there was oppression of minorities as well. You know, slaves had to appeal to white men in order to get free. You know, there's been oppression of different classes, races and things like that. And men obviously have been oppressed too.

[04:59:58:09 - 04:59:59:25]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, that's something everybody has been.

[04:59:59:25 - 05:00:19:07]
Speaker 3
 But I think as time has progressed, men had more and more agency and women didn't. And I think even if you're talking about voting, let's not just take voting off the table, just being women being able to own land or women being able to have a certain job, those were, you know, taken from them. And that's why I define it as oppression.

[05:00:19:07 - 05:00:24:10]
Speaker 1
 I would say it was taken from women. It's just that they never had it until recently.

[05:00:25:14 - 05:00:35:20]
Speaker 3
 Now voting, I think anyone should have the right to vote because it's their country. They have a right to say, I think if you're a disabled man, that doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to vote because you can't go to war. So I think, you know,

[05:00:35:20 - 05:00:47:17]
Speaker 1
 yeah, I don't know how I personally feel about the voting thing. Obviously, it shouldn't be split up by gender. That's that's stupid. But I mean, should should there be some for it? Was it accepting certain age? Like should you, for instance,

[05:00:49:15 - 05:01:31:07]
Speaker 1
 you know, the previous how the country started out basically was owning land was a thing, but with how the economy is now. And it's basically impossible for younger people to buy a house like even even even if we personally, it's just it makes me sad that I don't know if I'll ever be able to go home and older people got it for basically, you know, peanuts and were basically screwed with that. So I mean, it's hard to say exactly like if there should be some prerequisite to voting. But I mean, splitting it up by gender. That's so stupid.

[05:01:32:19 - 05:01:37:20]
Speaker 1
 But you know, should there should there be some kind of duty for voting?

[05:01:39:24 - 05:01:40:05]
Speaker 1
 I don't know.

[05:01:42:02 - 05:01:55:26]
Speaker 1
 Some people suggest things like a test that doesn't work because you know who designs the test. There's all kinds of issues with that. So I think what we have now is probably as good as it can get.

[05:01:57:20 - 05:01:59:23]
Speaker 1
 Not perfect, but it is what it is.

[05:02:03:01 - 05:02:10:15]
Speaker 3
 In terms of denying resources and rights, women minorities have had it worse than let's say white men in general.

[05:02:12:01 - 05:02:17:06]
Speaker 2
 I mean, it's perhaps on that specific front, you said denial of resources and rights

[05:02:17:06 - 05:02:20:10]
Speaker 3
 and rights systematic denial of resources and rights,

[05:02:20:10 - 05:02:24:07]
Speaker 2
 a systematic denial of resources and rights.

[05:02:26:04 - 05:02:33:03]
Speaker 2
 OK, so here's the examples you provided were what, like land ownership, land ownership, certain jobs, going to school.

[05:02:34:18 - 05:02:38:26]
Speaker 2
 Tell me what year do you think women were allowed to own property and land?

[05:02:38:26 - 05:02:40:21]
Speaker 3
 They weren't allowed to have.

[05:02:40:21 - 05:02:44:01]
Speaker 1
 I wouldn't know something like that off the top of my head.

[05:02:44:01 - 05:02:46:12]
Speaker 3
 You know, debt and bank accounts.

[05:02:46:12 - 05:03:09:22]
Speaker 1
 It was like the 70s or something of when we couldn't get like credit cards and stuff. But I'm not sure about like owning land. I think you could always simply own land if it was like passed down through your family or like your husband died or something. I think there were some I don't know the exact circumstances, but there were circumstances in which you could own land, but you couldn't just go and buy land. It had to be like given to you in some way or passed down.

[05:03:11:13 - 05:03:17:09]
Speaker 3
 Accounts and things like that for a long time. So they weren't only land until I mean, as far as I'm aware, they weren't on the land for quite some time.

[05:03:18:11 - 05:03:21:01]
Speaker 2
 Women have always been able to own land.

[05:03:21:01 - 05:03:22:07]
Speaker 3
 OK, maybe that's a bad example.

[05:03:22:07 - 05:03:23:21]
Speaker 2
 My understanding of it.

[05:03:23:21 - 05:03:29:15]
Speaker 1
 For sure, there's a caveat of it. You couldn't just buy it. You had to be like happen to have somebody who passed it down to you.

[05:03:30:19 - 05:03:44:13]
Speaker 2
 Is that when women were married, any property that she had became her essentially her husband's. That's my understanding. Oh, interesting. And if the marital couple they owns land, it was like in his.

[05:03:44:13 - 05:04:02:14]
Speaker 1
 So any property she had became her husband. So if somebody passed out property to her, it also became his if she got married. So that's I mean, that's even worse for whatever he's trying to say here. Like if if a woman did have enough land, if she got married, it became the man's like what? OK. Isn't that what kind of point is he trying to make here?

[05:04:02:14 - 05:04:09:28]
Speaker 2
 His name got went went to the women in the 1800s in the United States, 1900s. They could own land.

[05:04:09:28 - 05:04:12:07]
Speaker 3
 Maybe that's a bad example. Maybe maybe I'm wrong about that.

[05:04:12:07 - 05:04:13:01]
Speaker 2
 But for example,

[05:04:13:01 - 05:04:21:11]
Speaker 1
 a father couldn't go. OK, here's he's probably going to say about the whole inheritance thing, but they couldn't buy land. I mean, that's that's really different

[05:04:21:11 - 05:04:25:13]
Speaker 2
 in his will could bequeath to say he only had daughters.

[05:04:26:24 - 05:04:53:14]
Speaker 2
 If if if it was actually true that women could not own property or own land in the event that a father, a father of only daughters and he has say three, three or even one remaining heir, one daughter, two daughters, three daughters, where would the property go to? Probably the daughters. So they could own property and they could own theoretically, but this

[05:04:53:14 - 05:05:08:20]
Speaker 1
 isn't the dog that he thinks it is like being passed down something that you can't do much with except, you know, whatever you get made also becomes a man. It's like, that's not what is this? Some kind of like Sam Dunk here. I mean, what is what's going on?

[05:05:08:20 - 05:05:16:16]
Speaker 2
 But I'm saying if a woman wants to, it's not just theoretically me out in practice, women owned land. OK, they could buy land.

[05:05:16:16 - 05:05:19:21]
Speaker 1
 OK, I said they could buy land. I don't know about that.

[05:05:19:21 - 05:05:21:23]
Speaker 7
 But this might be a bit. Let's look it up.

[05:05:59:28 - 05:06:01:13]
Speaker 1
 Let's see what tragicity says.

[05:06:06:06 - 05:06:11:14]
Speaker 1
 I also went good women buy land and I mentioned that they couldn't own hair tents.

[05:06:13:00 - 05:06:14:10]
Speaker 1
 So let's see here.

[05:06:15:19 - 05:06:24:15]
Speaker 1
 Colonial and early U.S. periods, 1600s to early 1800s, and married women could own and inherit and sell land.

[05:06:25:15 - 05:06:43:14]
Speaker 1
 Married women lost control of their property to their husbands under English common law. Even inherited property became legally the husbands once they married. 1839 in Mississippi, specifically, Mississippi passed the first Married Women's Property Act allowing women to retain ownership of inherited land after marriage.

[05:06:45:13 - 05:07:05:28]
Speaker 1
 So this law mainly aimed to protect property from husbands' debts, not feminist liberation. 1848 New York, that's the model, New York's Married Women's Property Act, 1848, allowed married women to own property in their own name, control earnings, and buy and sell property.

[05:07:07:04 - 05:07:16:02]
Speaker 1
 Other states slowly followed often copying this one. So 1848 was when they could actually buy and sell property.

[05:07:17:29 - 05:07:25:13]
Speaker 1
 By 1900s most states allowed married women to buy land, but that doesn't say single.

[05:07:27:01 - 05:07:40:00]
Speaker 1
 Okay, yeah, so, okay, I missed something. So 1848 is New York's Married Women's Property Act. So it allowed married women to own property, control earnings, and buy and sell property. Only married women.

[05:07:42:03 - 05:07:43:11]
Speaker 1
 Or is it also single women?

[05:07:45:15 - 05:07:46:14]
Speaker 1
 Let's see.

[05:07:48:23 - 05:08:09:27]
Speaker 1
 So let's keep going because there's a little summary too. Most states allowed married women to buy land by 1900s. So most states had lost permitting, married women did, independently, buy and sell and manage property by the early 20th century. Southern states were slower,

[05:08:10:29 - 05:08:12:05]
Speaker 1
 but let's see.

[05:08:13:19 - 05:08:30:10]
Speaker 1
 Another line is that unmarried women could own land from early on, so married women got the legal right to buy and control land in 1839, but unmarried could actually buy land since colonial times.

[05:08:31:15 - 05:08:32:29]
Speaker 1
 Okay, I didn't know that. That's interesting.

[05:08:36:17 - 05:08:41:12]
Speaker 1
 So unmarried women could always inherit, buy, and sell land freely.

[05:08:42:13 - 05:08:52:08]
Speaker 1
 You can't do it without your husband until 1848. And from then on, it shifted to basically anybody could do it whenever.

[05:09:00:26 - 05:09:01:08]
Speaker 1
 Okay.

[05:09:04:26 - 05:09:11:03]
Speaker 1
 I thought that for some reason women couldn't actually buy it, but I was wrong.

[05:09:13:13 - 05:09:35:23]
Speaker 3
 That would be a bad example, but that doesn't mean women could have their own resources to purchase land. Maybe they inherited it or maybe it came through something else, but women weren't able to work in high paying jobs for a lot, high paying jobs in this country for quite some time. Like I said, they couldn't practice medicine or finance or law 55 years ago.

[05:09:35:23 - 05:09:37:16]
Speaker 2
 That's when someone's- 55, hold on.

[05:09:37:16 - 05:09:39:06]
Speaker 3
 It's in the 1970s.

[05:09:39:06 - 05:09:43:26]
Speaker 2
 Hold on. I think there were no female lawyers prior to the 1970s.

[05:09:43:26 - 05:09:46:22]
Speaker 1
 I don't know if that's true. I mean, it could be, but rare.

[05:09:46:22 - 05:09:48:02]
Speaker 3
 That's correct.

[05:09:48:02 - 05:10:03:02]
Speaker 2
 I'm going to have to, I need to fact check this. Just to be clear, there were no female lawyers- Women cannot practice law until around the 1970s. When could women practice-

[05:10:03:02 - 05:10:05:22]
Speaker 1
 It looks like they're looking it up, so I'll have to do it.

[05:10:05:22 - 05:10:10:13]
Speaker 2
 I'm going to have to go back to the first form of law and this was- hold on.

[05:10:11:16 - 05:10:13:20]
Speaker 2
 If you can correct me if I'm wrong.

[05:10:14:28 - 05:10:35:29]
Speaker 2
 The first formal admission of a woman to the bar was in 1869 with Arabella Mansfield's admission in Iowa. By 1879, federal law allowed qualified women to practice in any federal court, and Belva Lockwood became the first woman admitted to the bar of the Supreme Court.

[05:10:37:22 - 05:10:40:05]
Speaker 1
 Okay, so they had one lady back in the 1800s.

[05:10:40:05 - 05:10:45:05]
Speaker 2
 You're like a century off. 1870, 1869, 1879.

[05:10:45:05 - 05:10:50:03]
Speaker 3
 I'm telling you- I'm telling you in large practice, women couldn't practice law or medicine until 1970.

[05:10:50:03 - 05:10:55:15]
Speaker 2
 That's correct. Where's the evidence for this? I looked it up, man. This claim is completely dubious. I looked it up.

[05:10:55:15 - 05:10:57:20]
Speaker 1
 Well, let's see. I'm kind of curious.

[05:11:27:29 - 05:11:44:10]
Speaker 1
 You can legally do something. Doesn't mean that there aren't other things for us. If you can't- if nobody's going to hire you, where are you going to get the means to buy property? You'd have to inherit the money for it, right? You'd have to make money in some other way if you can't just get a job.

[05:11:48:20 - 05:11:50:18]
Speaker 1
 So yeah, 1869, first woman.

[05:11:51:26 - 05:11:54:01]
Speaker 1
 1872, first black woman.

[05:11:55:14 - 05:11:56:12]
Speaker 1
 In 1873,

[05:11:57:20 - 05:12:01:08]
Speaker 1
 Supreme Court says states can borrow women from practicing law.

[05:12:03:08 - 05:12:05:19]
Speaker 1
 In 1890, a lawyer reversed the scores of limits.

[05:12:07:02 - 05:12:08:10]
Speaker 1
 Bradwell, posthumously.

[05:12:10:19 - 05:12:19:01]
Speaker 1
 States set their own rules at first, and many still borrowed women through the 1880s through 1900s.

[05:12:20:22 - 05:12:30:08]
Speaker 1
 By 1920, the year of women's suffrage, most US states allowed women to practice law. Somehow that's where it took the 1920s and 1930s.

[05:12:32:07 - 05:12:35:02]
Speaker 1
 So in 1870, fewer than five total,

[05:12:36:09 - 05:12:43:15]
Speaker 1
 all pioneers are made by rare exception. 1900, there are about 1,000, still under 1% of all lawyers in the US.

[05:12:44:17 - 05:13:00:08]
Speaker 1
 By 1920, there are about 2,000 progress post-suffrage, but still about 1.3% of the bar. By 1940, there were 4,000, about 2.4% of US lawyers.

[05:13:01:14 - 05:13:28:09]
Speaker 1
 In 1970, there were 12,000, so it started to run pop-up after civil rights era. And now in 2020s, there's over 400,000, and women are now about 38% of all US lawyers. So up until around the 70s, where it became 12,000, which is still very low percentage, it was basically 1% to 2%.

[05:13:30:01 - 05:13:43:10]
Speaker 1
 So not a lot. So why so few at first? Barriers to law school admissions, marriage bans, some offers prohibited married women, cultural hostility, judges, and clients refused to take them seriously.

[05:13:44:12 - 05:13:59:12]
Speaker 1
 So yeah, that was, it is, sure there were a few at first, but I've been to various exceptions and there was all kinds of barriers to it. Yes, definitely a more recent development when women really started becoming lawyers.

[05:14:02:16 - 05:14:06:02]
Speaker 2
 Oh, dude. So you're saying by law, they were precluded? Correct.

[05:14:07:07 - 05:14:30:05]
Speaker 2
 Excuse me. Same way women were precluded from going to school. Same way women could go to school in the 1800s. To college? Yes. I believe there are perhaps some private schools that didn't allow them in. I think that's, I'm not denying that there weren't specific schools that barred women from entry, but my understanding is starting in the 1800s, women had access to higher education.

[05:14:30:05 - 05:14:35:08]
Speaker 3
 Let's say I'm wrong about all those things. Let's say, could women have their own bank account?

[05:14:36:12 - 05:14:39:08]
Speaker 2
 Could women have their own bank account? You tell me.

[05:14:39:08 - 05:14:51:28]
Speaker 3
 They couldn't. That was factually true? It's factually. I mean, look, I want to look at what you're looking at. Maybe my data was wrong. I doubt it, but I definitely would be curious. But do we have any more chats?

[05:14:51:28 - 05:14:56:03]
Speaker 2
 Yeah, there are some more chats. Hold on. I just had one thing on the bank thing.

[05:14:58:14 - 05:15:00:07]
Speaker 2
 My understanding here though.

[05:15:00:07 - 05:15:03:11]
Speaker 1
 Let's see what's the case. Are they going to look it up or do I have to look it up?

[05:15:04:24 - 05:15:25:02]
Speaker 2
 With this, women couldn't have bank accounts. And I'd like to research it because look, I honestly, it's not a specific category of like historical feminism that I'm aware of. What I've heard though is many banks, they require married women to have a husband co-signing. Or a brother. Mostly, but that was due to them being a unit.

[05:15:26:10 - 05:15:28:23]
Speaker 3
 It was due to them not being able to secure credit, I'm pretty sure.

[05:15:31:01 - 05:15:31:07]
Speaker 2
 Yeah.

[05:15:33:20 - 05:15:35:01]
Speaker 2
 Something about credit.

[05:15:37:04 - 05:15:38:02]
Speaker 2
 They

[05:15:38:02 - 05:15:46:22]
Speaker 1
 couldn't hold debt, which is like he's going to say, "Oh, that's such a privilege that women couldn't hold debt."

[05:15:47:26 - 05:15:49:12]
Speaker 1
 Which, sure, I mean in some ways.

[05:15:50:12 - 05:15:56:16]
Speaker 1
 But debt is kind of how our society is ran if you can't borrow money.

[05:15:57:29 - 05:16:01:02]
Speaker 1
 It's really hard to start a business or be an entrepreneur in general.

[05:16:02:07 - 05:16:23:15]
Speaker 1
 So unmarried women could always open and manage their own bank accounts by probably your own business. But social restrictions and later marriage still had limited access. So married women before 1840 couldn't independently have any kind of financial thing, bank account.

[05:16:24:23 - 05:16:29:05]
Speaker 1
 You know, even if they had a job, their wages and all of their stuff legally belonged to the husband.

[05:16:30:17 - 05:16:36:07]
Speaker 1
 So anything they did, buy land, do school, any kind of investment, everything had to go through the husband.

[05:16:40:07 - 05:16:41:08]
Speaker 1
 Let's see here.

[05:16:44:16 - 05:16:54:01]
Speaker 1
 Yeah, so it seems like legally, if you were unmarried and you were just single, you could always do kind of whatever legally.

[05:16:55:06 - 05:16:57:10]
Speaker 1
 But societally you couldn't.

[05:16:59:00 - 05:17:02:04]
Speaker 1
 There were, like, makes her like, "No, thank you."

[05:17:03:16 - 05:17:04:18]
Speaker 1
 It seems like so.

[05:17:05:22 - 05:17:12:23]
Speaker 1
 Doesn't exactly say here when that changed, but let's ask.

[05:17:23:15 - 05:17:33:29]
Speaker 1
 Because that's interesting, yeah. So even though it was legal, banks still send no to many single women, especially through the 1800s to mid-1900s.

[05:17:35:05 - 05:17:51:04]
Speaker 1
 So the reasons being banks were often privately run and male-dominated, even if no law said no women, they could just say we don't allow accounts in women's names, especially if they weren't married, wealthy, or vouched for by a man.

[05:17:53:02 - 05:17:57:20]
Speaker 1
 They couldn't really do anything about it because there was no anti-discrimination laws.

[05:18:01:02 - 05:18:03:06]
Speaker 1
 They couldn't really do anything about it until...
