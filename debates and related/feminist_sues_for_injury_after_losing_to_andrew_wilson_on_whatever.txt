Title: Feminist SUES for INJURY After Losing to Andrew Wilson on Whatever!
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJKm1YhmE4

(0:00) Do you remember this girl here? If you
(0:02) don't, here's a quick refresher. I
(0:03) debated with her on the Whatever
(0:06) podcast. She rage quit. Lunatic
(0:08) feminist. What many of you may not know
(0:11) is that she came down, she's suing the
(0:14) show because she got so brutalized in
(0:16) that debate. And she also apparently
(0:18) came down with balls pausy. Uh here is
(0:22) in her own words.
(0:23) Side of my face was completely
(0:25) paralyzed. I've had a very difficult and
(0:27) stressful week and I have been sick the
(0:29) last couple of weeks with a virus
(0:30) without really taking care of myself. I
(0:32) just assumed it would go away and didn't
(0:34) go get medication. If you've ever heard
(0:35) of Belle's pausy, that's what I have. It
(0:38) could be significantly worse, but I
(0:40) wanted to make a video about it because
(0:42) it is slightly embarrassing and it's
(0:44) difficult for me to talk this side.
(0:46) Uhhuh. It's very difficult for her to
(0:48) talk, Jake, because of the balls pausy
(0:50) in her mouth. side. I can't really move
(0:54) as well as this side. This is apparently
(0:56) a temporary condition, but it is brought
(0:58) on by stress and emotional difficulties
(1:01) that no matter what you're going
(1:02) through, please take care of yourself
(1:03) because you never know how that stress
(1:05) is going to manifest.
(1:07) Now, I want to remind everybody of the
(1:11) 150 IQ, the genius level IQ that we've
(1:13) got on display here. From her words, she
(1:15) has a 150 level IQ and she reads 300
(1:18) books a year. That's one book pretty
(1:20) much every single day. So,
(1:22) Oh, yeah. I forgot about that. She Yeah,
(1:24) she reads like 400 books or some crazy
(1:26) [ __ ] I remember.
(1:28) Yeah.
(1:29) Every year.
(1:30) Yeah. What causes balls Pauly, Jake?
(1:33) Losing a debate with Andrew Wilson
(1:35) apparently will cause half of your face
(1:37) to go completely limp and give you a
(1:40) permanent medical condition for which
(1:42) you should then sue for
(1:44) temporary. But it's still really scary
(1:46) to wake up, here are some photos, and
(1:48) not be able to move your
(1:51) Do you see the photo? Hang on. I want to
(1:53) see if I can get it in a still frame.
(1:55) Hang on. I want to see. Let's see if
(1:57) this should be temporary, but it's still
(1:59) really scary to wake up. Here are some
(2:00) photos.
(2:04) I feel like I've gotten I've I've gotten
(2:05) Bell's palsy a few times after after a
(2:08) night out with you, though, Andrew. So,
(2:09) it does make sense.
(2:10) Well, that's from hangovers, though.
(2:11) That's okay, right? It's not my fault
(2:14) that you Australians can't drink and us
(2:16) Irish can't. It's not uh it's not our
(2:19) fault.
(2:20) I think we could drink you under the
(2:21) table. But anyways, she was doing a
(2:23) little bit of uh nose scratchy and uh
(2:25) there was a little bit going on there.
(2:26) There was a few rumors going around that
(2:28) there was a lot of touching of the nose
(2:29) going on, but you know, that's just all
(2:31) speculation obviously.
(2:32) Yeah, some somebody needs to make that
(2:33) an emoji for sure, right? For sure.
(2:37) So, please be kind to people. when you
(2:39) never know what they're going through
(2:41) and take care of yourself early on.
(2:43) Hopefully regain function soon. But
(2:46) I love how she can just cry
(2:48) immediately.
(2:50) Uh like, you know, on demand, she can
(2:52) just cry immediately. All right, diving
(2:54) right into this.
(2:54) Top five phrases that white people use
(2:56) to indicate they are closeted racist. I
(2:58) was
(2:58) top five phrases, Jake. Uh I'm I'm
(3:01) guessing that um you probably use all of
(3:04) them.
(3:06) I think I think they'll be familiar. I
(3:08) want to try and guess what they are, but
(3:09) I really honestly can't imagine what
(3:11) she's about to say.
(3:13) Yeah,
(3:13) we can call this sort of thing.
(3:15) Well, the one thing that she needs to
(3:17) say is that we haven't grifted enough
(3:19) and you need to send in memberships
(3:21) immediately. Gift memberships
(3:22) immediately. Send in money immediately.
(3:24) And the reason you should do that is
(3:25) because we have a goal of 5,000 members
(3:27) in 90 days. I think we can do it.
(3:29) Raised around a lot of racist white
(3:31) people. And so these are the phrases
(3:33) that people would use in public and then
(3:34) in private they would be incredibly
(3:35) racist. Number one, I'm not racist. I
(3:37) treat everybody the same. And although
(3:39) they treat everyone the same, they are
(3:40) the people who often
(3:41) Hold on a second. Is this is this is she
(3:44) trying to say what liberals say?
(3:46) No, she liberals.
(3:47) Yeah, I know. I don't But she she just
(3:49) assumes, I guess, that this is common
(3:51) for people to say. Uh that's like
(3:53) the underhanded racism of the liberals
(3:55) is absolutely amazing.
(3:56) Yeah, I prefer to be just really overt
(4:00) racist and hateful stereotypes in
(4:02) private. Number two, I just care about
(4:04) the economy. No, you only
(4:10) That's the economy, stupid.
(4:12) Yeah. All about the economy, dummy.
(4:15) About preventing black, brown, queer, or
(4:17) disabled people from accessing
(4:18) healthcare and then you go home to your
(4:19) white family and your white kids and you
(4:21) start saying slurs and convincing your
(4:22) kids why they shouldn't marry a person
(4:24) of color.
(4:25) Now, I have a slightly different take on
(4:28) what I think that if people are overt in
(4:31) their racism and as overt as possible,
(4:33) making fun of every single race, that
(4:35) signifies to me that somebody actually
(4:37) is not a racist because, you know,
(4:40) everyone can get it. Nobody's safe.
(4:42) Yeah. I mean, isn't that Don't they call
(4:45) that military doctrine? Like, you you
(4:47) can be racist in the military. As long
(4:49) as you're racist to everybody, it's
(4:50) fine, right?
(4:51) Yeah. I think that should be the rule.
(4:53) Number three,
(4:54) as long as nobody's nobody is safe.
(4:57) I don't like identity politics. This is
(4:59) not one that I hear that often except
(5:01) from like weird libertarians and people
(5:03) like this because all politics is
(5:05) identity politics.
(5:06) Oh, you mean when it's not about you?
(5:08) Because whiteness is already centered in
(5:10) every other aspect. So the one time it's
(5:11) not, you you get mad.
(5:12) Oh, great. Yeah, whiteness. Whiteness.
(5:15) What do they mean by whiteness is always
(5:17) scented? What is What does that even
(5:18) mean? Well, it just means that society
(5:20) has uh revolves around white people,
(5:22) which kind mean I'm not saying anything
(5:26) here, okay? I'm not I didn't say
(5:29) anything, okay? I'm just say that's what
(5:31) they mean is that society revolves
(5:33) around white people.
(5:33) Number four, why does everything have to
(5:35) be about race? Because everything is
(5:37) about race.
(5:39) There we go. Liberal little progressive
(5:41) race baiting for you. They can't help
(5:43) themselves, can they?
(5:45) Yeah. No, I mean their discourse is
(5:46) surrounded is is all about whiteness.
(5:48) That's for sure. That's all they care
(5:49) about is whiteness.
(5:50) 100%.
(5:51) Is quite literally anything that you can
(5:53) think of in America is rooted in race.
(5:55) Tipping culture. The naming of
(5:57) tipping culture is rooted in race.
(6:01) I mean, I'm I'm I don't know. Are you
(6:03) more likely to tip your Mexican or you
(6:04) more likely to tip your whiteer?
(6:07) Uh I mean, I just I just you know, I
(6:10) just tip if the service is good.
(6:11) And number five, I just think people
(6:12) should follow the law. You mean the law
(6:14) that is inherently racist and that
(6:16) criminalizes blackness or
(6:20) the law is inherently racist? Remember
(6:23) when he said that you have rights and
(6:24) those your rights are inherent? And then
(6:27) I said really your rights are inherent
(6:29) where do they come from? She was like
(6:31) God. I said I thought you didn't believe
(6:32) in God. I don't.
(6:34) Was it Was it her that was continually
(6:36) using the word inherent? Inherently
(6:39) say inher Yeah. Somebody the first
(6:40) comment was like, "This chick inherently
(6:42) lost this debate."
(6:43) Yeah.
(6:45) That has banned indigenous practices and
(6:47) celebrations. Right. Right.
(6:50) H you know, I just love destroying these
(6:54) feminists and watching their brains melt
(6:56) when I'm done with them. I do. But you
(6:58) can see just the depths of her madness.
(7:00) She was actually on her best behavior.
(7:03) When you look at these, you realize she
(7:05) was on her best behavior for that
(7:07) podcast. Isn't that crazy?
(7:10) Yeah, I mean you look at the Tik Tok and
(7:11) it tells a completely I mean it tells
(7:13) the real story to be honest, but the
(7:14) only thing I'm a little bit disappointed
(7:16) about is this. This is post Belle's
(7:18) Pauly and it looks to have gone down
(7:20) quite a bit. So I'm I'm not feeling as
(7:22) inspired.
(7:23) Well, I don't know. Look at her face.
(7:26) It's more of a slight one. In the video
(7:28) before, she was really,
(7:30) you know,
(7:30) she has a little bit going on right now,
(7:34) right? A little bit.
(7:35) Yeah.
(7:36) Looks like you could just be tipsy
(7:37) though now. Yeah, maybe
(7:39) that fascism is an issue in the United
(7:40) States. You need
(7:41) Fascism is an issue in the United
(7:43) States.
(7:44) Look at what's happening in LA. Trump
(7:45) literally called in the National Guard
(7:47) on protesters in LA to disrupt them and
(7:49) to use tear gas and rubber bullets.
(7:51) Oh. Oh, yeah. So her she's she's very
(7:55) upset because uh Trump sent in the
(7:59) National Guard to bring back order
(8:02) because Nuskum uh has basically given
(8:05) all of his police officers a standown
(8:07) order and has let them be completely out
(8:09) of control as we'll see soon. I think
(8:12) that actually it does meet the
(8:13) definition of fascism though because if
(8:15) you look at the definition of fascism,
(8:16) it's national pride and orange man.
(8:20) Orange man and military. National Pride,
(8:22) orange man, military fascist.
(8:24) Wasn't that what Destiny said to me? I
(8:26) think that's what he said to me. But
(8:29) it's like a strong national pride
(8:31) national pride
(8:34) forces and the entire goal here is to
(8:36) protect and defend the homeland. Newsome
(8:38) and other people in California actively
(8:40) said that they do not want people to
(8:42) come in and police. He is sending 2,000
(8:45) people with tactical training and giant
(8:47) military weapons in to disrupt. that is
(8:50) literally going to put fuel into the
(8:52) fire and make things blow up even more.
(8:55) What does she want? What does she want
(8:57) to happen?
(8:57) Well, this is the cope. This is the left
(8:59) cope. The left cope is we have to let
(9:02) these people do whatever they want and
(9:04) destroy everything in their path because
(9:06) if you try to stop them, they're just
(9:08) going to get upsetty spaghetti and then
(9:10) they're really going to destroy [ __ ]
(9:12) Really? Even more so than they're
(9:13) already destroying [ __ ]
(9:15) That's that's actually the argument. Not
(9:17) kidding. That's the real argument. Yeah,
(9:19) but it's the total opposite. It's
(9:20) because these people don't understand
(9:21) consequences to their actions and that's
(9:23) why they do this. If they thought that
(9:24) they were going to get stomped out
(9:26) immediately, then they wouldn't do it
(9:27) because they're all little liberal
(9:28) [ __ ] and they're all laughing like
(9:29) they're trying to be revolutionaries.
(9:31) Mr. E, pull up Mighty Megatron's
(9:32) comment. That'sing hilarious. He says,
(9:36) "This is what happens when dad isn't
(9:38) home to smack the kids."
(9:40) Yeah. Yeah.
(9:41) Yeah.
(9:42) People are getting injured. They are
(9:43) literally having to pour water and other
(9:46) milk into their eyes because they can't
(9:48) see. One of the
(9:50) Well, the thing is I I have a 100%
(9:54) surefire way for how you'll never get
(9:56) tear gas in your eyes. What here's
(10:00) here's what you do. I'm going to give it
(10:01) to you step by step. One, when there's
(10:04) riots going on, you don't go.
(10:07) And then,
(10:08) yep.
(10:08) Step two is you just repeat step one.
(10:10) And then that's that's it. Like I like
(10:12) the fact that they're getting milk in
(10:13) their masks. That really that's that's
(10:15) quite satisfying. They're getting milky
(10:17) masks.
(10:18) Yeah. Well, I I mean we were watching
(10:20) them cry last night on stream when they
(10:22) were getting gassed. And I mean that
(10:23) shit's just hilarious to watch.
(10:24) I saw one of them collapse like go down.
(10:27) It was like a slow collapse.
(10:29) Well, I mean, but that's extra funny.
(10:31) Core principles of fascism is trying to
(10:33) shut down dissenting opinion. And I
(10:36) actually it's not that's not a core
(10:38) tenant of fascism. That's a core tenant
(10:40) of she just made it the up.
(10:43) That's a core tenant of she just made it
(10:45) the up.
(10:46) Haven't you read all of the fascist
(10:48) intellectuals, Andrew?
(10:50) I have actually.
(10:51) I think he me he me he mentions this.
(10:53) Giovanni Gentiel definitely mentions
(10:54) this and he mentions Trump as well.
(10:56) Yeah. Well, that is true. He did predict
(10:58) Trump, but other than that, you know,
(11:01) than that, other than his crystal ball,
(11:03) I can't think of a better way to do that
(11:04) than calling it a [ __ ] military
(11:06) brand. The American people have a right
(11:07) to protest and stand in solidarity with
(11:10) immigrants as well as Palestinian.
(11:12) Hey, Redacted, thank you so much for the
(11:14) raid. We really appreciate it. Very,
(11:16) very kind of you.
(11:18) Yeah. What's that?
(11:19) One of my favorite podcasts. Red. Thank
(11:21) you.
(11:21) Yeah, I love it. Thank you. So, on this
(11:24) this chick is of course going apeshit
(11:26) again. Yes, it is true. Americans have
(11:28) the right to peacefully assemble. She
(11:32) forgets that part. They have the right
(11:34) to peacefully assemble. They don't have
(11:36) the right to assemble as mobs with
(11:38) foreign flags and uh wreck [ __ ] in a
(11:42) country that's not even theirs. That is
(11:44) not uh protest. That's an invasion and
(11:47) that's what we're dealing with. Yeah.
(11:49) Yep.
(11:51) People, this is infringing upon our
(11:52) rights and this is serious. So if you
(11:54) see this video, please share it. Stand
(11:57) together. Join local protests and call
(11:58) your [ __ ] representative. Immigrants
(12:00) aren't destroying our economy. Bill,
(12:02) here we go. We We got Crash Out Kylie on
(12:05) her next rant about immigrants. Mystery,
(12:07) you might want to turn the video up a
(12:08) little bit, by the way. All right.
(12:10) It's not fair. Immigrants get free
(12:11) healthcare and I don't. You know whose
(12:12) fault that is? I'll give you a hint.
(12:13) It's not immigrants. It's not black
(12:14) people. It's not trans people. It's the
(12:16) billionaires that are hoarding trillions
(12:18) of dollars in wealth and sucking the
(12:20) life out of society.
(12:22) Oh, really? I thought that it was
(12:24) liberal progressive policies. That's
(12:26) what I thought it was. I thought it was
(12:28) liberal progressive policies where they
(12:29) were like, "Well, if you're under the
(12:31) poverty line, give us all of those
(12:33) people and we'll give them free
(12:34) healthcare because they're under the
(12:35) poverty line." Oh, hey, you workingass
(12:37) Joe and workingclass uh Jill, pay up.
(12:42) Pay for their healthare. California used
(12:45) to have, by the way, one of the finest
(12:46) health care systems in the world, some
(12:48) of the finest hospitals in the world
(12:50) with some of the finest doctors in the
(12:52) world. Totally [ __ ] destroyed.
(12:55) totally destroyed because of the
(12:57) Hispanic invasion, bankrupted uh most of
(13:00) the major hospitals which were there.
(13:03) That's no no [ __ ] You can go uh look
(13:05) back especially in the 80s and 90s some
(13:07) of the finest hospitals in the world
(13:08) totally destroyed.
(13:10) The working class pays more in taxes
(13:12) than Amazon. And while we're sitting
(13:14) here arguing about who deserves food
(13:15) stamps,
(13:16) the working class pays more in taxes
(13:18) than Amazon. the working class. There's
(13:21) a lot more of them to tax than there is
(13:23) an Amazon.
(13:25) How much is how much percentage of the
(13:27) uh United States labor force is
(13:28) considered the working class? I wonder
(13:31) I don't have to Amazon, the one company.
(13:33) Yeah, I don't have the stats offhand,
(13:34) but you would say probably uh most
(13:36) people would be uh considered inside the
(13:39) working class. The poverty line is
(13:41) actually uh not as large and it's
(13:43) shrinking every single year.
(13:45) Who doesn't deserve food stamps? Who
(13:47) deserves free healthcare? They are
(13:48) literally using those tax dollars to fly
(13:50) to space to do [ __ ] side.
(13:53) They're using those tax dollars to fly
(13:55) to [ __ ] space. This is a crush out
(13:58) Kylie with another great take
(14:00) quest.
(14:00) It's not all the Mexicans that are
(14:02) flying to Spence, by the way.
(14:06) We need someone to clean up the trash
(14:07) around NASA, bro.
(14:13) Yeah, I know. This guy says, "How dare
(14:14) billionaires keep their money?" I know
(14:16) those. the audacity of these people
(14:18) they stole from our labor. The
(14:20) scapegoating is strategic. If you're
(14:22) busy blaming the most vulnerable people
(14:24) in society, because let's face it, there
(14:25) will always be those people. You are not
(14:27) going to notice as your money is being
(14:29) stolen from you slowly over time.
(14:31) Corporations, landlords, and the
(14:33) politicians.
(14:34) Corporations, landlords, politician. So,
(14:36) here's the thing. The left makes a
(14:38) pretty good point here, which is true,
(14:41) that there is an unholy alliance between
(14:44) corporate America, NOS's, and uh the
(14:48) federal government and state
(14:49) governments. That's true. I'm not
(14:51) disputing that.
(14:52) Liberals.
(14:53) Yeah. But progressives are the ones who
(14:55) push that more than anybody. What this
(14:56) is what gay pride was was it was all
(14:59) astroturfed
(15:01) uh NOS's. And uh what they did was they
(15:04) would approach various companies to get
(15:07) them to side with them and fund them and
(15:09) put the rainbow [ __ ] everywhere. It's
(15:11) like the left are the ones who go for
(15:13) the corporations to push all this [ __ ]
(15:15) not the right. When's the last time you
(15:17) saw the right get pushed by a
(15:18) corporation? What thing got pushed by
(15:20) it?
(15:21) Yeah. I mean, we've been pushing against
(15:22) it, ironically, which is the way that
(15:24) the tables have turned. But it's funny
(15:25) because if she wants to talk about
(15:26) fascism, and that's definitely
(15:28) intrinsically fascist or whatever the
(15:30) hell she says. Well, I mean, the merger
(15:32) of corporation and state and media is
(15:37) getting a little bit closer. Is getting
(15:38) a little bit closer than her.
(15:40) It's becoming more of a body of the
(15:42) state, isn't it?
(15:43) They bought those are the people who are
(15:45) to blame. You're not broke because your
(15:47) coworker is trans or your neighbor is
(15:49) undocumented. You're broke because
(15:51) billionaires rigged the system and they
(15:53) are laughing at us as we fight amongst
(15:55) each other. And you're
(15:57) well, nah. You see, the thing is is that
(16:01) I you would she would almost have a
(16:02) point if it wasn't the case that the
(16:05) local Democrats in most of these like
(16:07) take Grand Rapids for instance. I was
(16:09) just bitching about this on Crowder's
(16:10) show when Gretchen Whitmer says that
(16:13) she's going to fix the road. She didn't
(16:15) fix the roads. She gave the money to a
(16:17) bunch of transgenders and a bunch of
(16:19) minorities and was very public about
(16:21) doing so. when she was taking in all
(16:23) that money for COVID relief, she gave
(16:25) millions of dollars to uh study the
(16:27) effects of COVID and minority
(16:29) communities. You know, this is this is
(16:31) what they do. And then they pretend, no,
(16:33) no, it's just fascist. No, this is
(16:35) leftwing America. This is what leftwing
(16:38) America wants.
(16:38) If I ever want my roads fixed, I give
(16:40) the money to transgenders. I don't know
(16:42) about you.
(16:42) Yeah. Well, I mean, it's not it's not
(16:44) their fault that you you keep giving
(16:46) them [ __ ] money. It's not their fault
(16:48) this transgenders are good road fixes.
(16:51) Yeah. It's going to be you that one day
(16:53) you're going to be the billionaire. But
(16:54) guess what? Most of us are in the same
(16:56) boat here. Wake up. Wake up. Let's talk
(16:59) about how overturning Roby Wade has
(17:00) nothing to do with states rights and
(17:02) everything to do with white women.
(17:08) I was not was not expecting that, but
(17:11) she's got a point so far. Hang on. Let's
(17:14) hear her out. Let's hear her out.
(17:16) If you've ever heard of the great
(17:17) replacement theory, this is one of the
(17:19) most common conspiracy theories among
(17:21) farright people.
(17:22) Ah yes, the great replacement theory.
(17:24) The theory goes something like this. Due
(17:27) to the fact that the population of the
(17:30) United States cannot reproduce itself,
(17:34) due to women especially deferring their
(17:36) reproductive years to go to college
(17:37) instead of having a family due to the
(17:39) propaganda of the left that the
(17:43) government and other governments of the
(17:46) world have been coalesing to pump in
(17:50) tons and tons and tons of migrants to
(17:52) then replace the domestic population of
(17:55) these various countries. What's really
(17:57) interesting about this theory is that
(18:00) that's exactly what's happening. I don't
(18:02) know. How can you call this a theory at
(18:04) this point?
(18:05) Well, it's a mathematical fact if you if
(18:07) you really think about it, but the
(18:08) interesting part about the Great
(18:09) Replacement that the liberals well, they
(18:11) probably don't do the research into it,
(18:12) but it's actually it was actually
(18:14) popularized by a gay French liberal
(18:16) named Renault Camu in in uh in France.
(18:18) And it was about all the immigrants
(18:20) coming from the colonies in France and
(18:21) how they would eventually replace the
(18:22) French population. And it was just the
(18:24) mathematical formula that leads you
(18:25) there.
(18:26) Yeah. Well, I mean this this is exactly
(18:29) what's happening. I mean, you take the
(18:31) domestic population has not replaced
(18:32) itself. You add millions upon millions
(18:35) per year in immigrants. You you they
(18:37) pump in almost one to one uh the amount
(18:41) of of immigrants as they do for the
(18:44) amount of abortions. So, it's somewhere
(18:46) uh somewhere around a million to a
(18:48) million, right?
(18:49) A lot of American conservatives believe
(18:51) in this. They believe that enough
(18:52) immigrants are coming into the country
(18:53) and enough white women are having
(18:55) children with non-white people that one
(18:56) day this birth rate is going to overtake
(18:58) the white birth rate.
(19:00) No, that's not how the theory works.
(19:02) That's a progressive twist on the
(19:04) theory. The truth of the matter is is
(19:05) that misogynation's always actually been
(19:07) pretty rare. This is uh different races
(19:10) actually um having children with each
(19:12) other. That's fairly rare. That's not a
(19:15) thing which is um which is even really
(19:17) happening. Most races have children with
(19:18) the same within the the confines of the
(19:20) same race. to date within their own
(19:21) preferences. Misogynation's never really
(19:23) been a huge issue. What is happening
(19:25) though is that we are pumping in tons
(19:27) millions of migrants in order to replace
(19:29) the domestic population because we don't
(19:32) uh push any sort of top- down propaganda
(19:35) for reproduction domestically. And yes,
(19:37) that includes for white people. Yeah.
(19:40) And also it's like these these people
(19:42) tend to form cultural enclaves as well
(19:43) and they tend to reproduce within their
(19:45) own communities. If you look at England
(19:47) for example, England is going to be a
(19:48) Muslim country within 50 years, maybe
(19:51) even before that. They've got a Muslim
(19:52) mayor of Birmingham and a Muslim mayor
(19:54) of London and they had city and they had
(19:55) the um Richie Sunnak who is an also also
(19:57) a Muslim guy. They will be a Muslim
(19:59) country in in 50 years and they're going
(20:02) to get out they're already getting
(20:03) outbred. So this is happening all around
(20:05) the world.
(20:06) Yep. And as secularism is pushed in
(20:08) western nations, uh, reproduction
(20:11) continues to drop because they can't
(20:13) give a good for why people shouldn't
(20:14) just be solopsists. They shouldn't just
(20:16) focus on themselves and only themselves
(20:19) the most selfish ways possible. And
(20:21) yeah, this is it's a culmination. It's
(20:23) not any one factor. It's a culmination
(20:25) of factors.
(20:26) You could apply it to liberals though.
(20:28) you could apply the great the great
(20:29) replacement to liberals because there
(20:30) will be a great replacement in the
(20:32) coming generations of religious people
(20:33) who breed more and outre outbreed
(20:35) liberals. So I think that uh bookmark
(20:38) this but the liberals might come up with
(20:39) their own great replacement
(20:41) eventually. If white people don't have
(20:42) majority status they won't be able to
(20:44) impose their rule upon everyone else.
(20:45) Now that brings me to the white women
(20:47) birth rate problem. It's a commonly
(20:49) documented fact that white women have
(20:51) declining birth rates more than any
(20:53) other demographic of people. This is
(20:55) likely due to a number of factors, but
(20:56) the primary one is that white people
(20:58) typically have access to better health
(21:00) care resources, aka birth control.
(21:01) Nope. Has nothing to do with that. And
(21:04) it has nothing to do even with abortion.
(21:06) The primary reason is because white
(21:09) women more than any other uh demographic
(21:11) are going to college. Now, except I
(21:14) think the Asian demographic does too,
(21:15) but there's not as many, right? And
(21:17) Asians have the whole tiger mom thing
(21:18) and they want to have children and this
(21:20) kind of they actually have some cultural
(21:21) barriers there for children whereas
(21:23) white women don't. They defer their
(21:25) childbearing years to go to college and
(21:27) then establish a career. So they're
(21:28) getting married at 28 years old on
(21:30) average uh or 30 years old. How many
(21:33) kids are you going to have at 30? How
(21:35) many?
(21:36) Yeah. But like also what's actually
(21:37) wrong with just saying that we want
(21:39) white women to reproduce? I don't see
(21:41) anything wrong with that whatsoever. I
(21:42) mean
(21:43) there'd be no problem. Yeah. If if there
(21:45) was another if there was like a Mexicans
(21:47) who were saying we want to replace our
(21:48) population. We don't want to go extinct.
(21:50) The liberals would never complain. But
(21:51) it's only if it's white women. Well, I
(21:53) always catch these all of them with the
(21:54) same question. Are you happy that Native
(21:56) Americans aren't reproducing?
(21:59) They always say no. They always say,
(22:00) "No, I'm not happy about that." And I
(22:02) say, "Why?"
(22:03) "Because I want to preserve their
(22:05) cultural." Oh,
(22:08) because you want to preserve that people
(22:09) group. Yes. Okay, you stupid [ __ ]
(22:12) Exactly.
(22:14) And other options to decide to carry out
(22:16) the pregnancy or not. Well-known
(22:18) conservative politicians have even
(22:19) stated that white women need to start
(22:20) having more babies. They do. They do
(22:23) need to start having more babies. They
(22:24) do. I actually don't want to see white
(22:26) people go extinct. That's true. Yeah.
(22:28) That isn't that terrible? Oh my god.
(22:32) They've done some good stuff in history.
(22:33) Yeah.
(22:34) They Yeah, they've they a little bit
(22:36) little bit of good stuff.
(22:37) They've built some built some good
(22:38) places, but they don't have tacos,
(22:39) though. I mean, whatever.
(22:41) They have tacos now.
(22:44) We have the technology. My wife's white.
(22:46) She makes a she makes a good taco.
(22:50) Yeah. Good point. Yeah,
(22:52) we have incorporated their food
(22:54) technology. We no longer need the people
(22:55) group. You take the food tech and you
(22:58) leave. Don't white people own pizzeras?
(23:00) Yes, they do.
(23:02) I'm stumped.
(23:03) Yeah.
(23:04) So, no. This is nothing to do with the
(23:06) right to life or states rights. It's
(23:07) literally rooted in white supremacy and
(23:09) misogyny. And
(23:10) Uh-huh. So, it's rooted in white
(23:12) supremacy and mis You see, this is the
(23:14) problem. She acknowledges the great
(23:16) replacement is happening. She just says,
(23:18) "But it's it's actually just some white
(23:20) nationalist shit." Even though it's
(23:22) happening. It is happening. That's true.
(23:24) But it the only people who care about it
(23:26) are white nationalists. These people are
(23:28) interchangeable
(23:30) widgets. They're all of their talking
(23:32) points are exactly the same. They have
(23:33) no idea what the they're talking about.
(23:35) They've never really looked into these
(23:36) issues. It's all surface
