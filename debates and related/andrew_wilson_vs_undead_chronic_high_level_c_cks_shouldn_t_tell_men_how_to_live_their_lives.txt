(0:08) All right, Undead Chronic. I leave it to you to open. Cool. There is a mountain.
(0:14) It's called Cuck Mountain. He who sits at the top of Cuck Mountain is Mr. Jack Murphy. Actual cuckled. People who watch
(0:23) their wives engage in sexual activities with other people. Why is cucking bad? Why do men not like
(0:31) to be cucked? Because you're giving up access to your sexual resources to other
(0:37) men, right? There are levels of cucking. Everybody here listening is a cuck if
(0:42) you pay taxes to the federal government, right? Unfortunately, we all get cucked that way because your money gets sent to
(0:49) single mothers and bass kids through welfare, through whatever it is. I would
(0:56) argue that a man who marries a single mother is higher on cuck mountain than
(1:03) someone who says I want to have my own children and spend all my resources on
(1:08) my own children. That's pretty much it. Okay. Um I put the floor to Andrew.
(1:19) That's that really that's it. That's all you wanted to do there.
(1:24) Okay. Am I supposed to respond or No, I I was just just making sure. No. No. Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.
(1:30) So, uh, as expected, this, uh, I think that this is just going to be a kind of routine hater debate. I actually rather
(1:37) enjoy these more than any other type because my haters really don't know very much about me at all and basically just
(1:42) make assumptions or reuse old attacks which have already been addressed 100 times. Uh, the fact they get so much
(1:48) wrong obviously amuses me, but the attacks usually center around my wife, kids, and doesn't really have anything
(1:54) to do with what I say, but rather who I chose to marry and have kids with. Mhm. The topic of this debate is going to be
(2:00) centered around uh, of course, uh, is being a stepfather cuckoldry. Now, a
(2:05) person can create any definition of the word cuckoldry they like. I think that we just saw Undead Chronic do that, for
(2:11) instance. Um but it does need to point to a category and that category should
(2:16) contain information which is coherent. The itemology of the word cuckled comes from middle English cuckweld from old
(2:22) French cuckwalt from the cuckoo bird. The equivalent words in French and other
(2:27) languages applied to both the bird and the adulterer. Cuckold has never been applied to the bird in the English language for instance and that's where
(2:33) some of the nebulousness of the term comes from. Shakespeare and other playwriters popularized the term because
(2:39) all rights in the name were perilineal uh from father to son. So peasants, nobles, monarchs alike had a very real
(2:45) fear of being cuckled, which meant their wife would cheat and they'd end up raising and siring a child not their own
(2:52) unknowingly. Thus, if ever later revealed, it could topple entire noble lines. And in the past, that actually
(2:58) has happened. The word has evolved to include men who want to watch other men have sex with their significant other.
(3:04) He mentioned Jack Murphy. I think that's a good example. Uh wife, girlfriend, whatever. But this has only been a
(3:10) recent inclusion as a pornographic category, and it describes essentially the same behavior just in the style of
(3:17) fetish where now the man is fetishizing not knowing if the child is his or not. This is by far the most common use of
(3:24) the word in modernity. what most people mean when they say it. The theme crossover with the itemology makes
(3:30) perfect sense because in both cases the meaning is defaulting to not knowing if your offspring is actually yours. A
(3:37) stepfather or mother on the other hand doesn't fit that criteria as paternity isn't what is in question. Joseph, the
(3:43) husband of Mary, for instance, was stepfather to Jesus Christ. If we were to use undead chronic definition here or
(3:50) use uh any of the word cuckled the way he says it, we would have to blaspheme
(3:55) and say God cuckled Joseph which makes zero sense as in that sense then every
(4:00) man on planet earth would be a cuckled by this logic as a thing which makes us us is created by the divine god and it's
(4:06) called the soul. Also there are further logical issues if we extrapolate this to adopt also would be cuckoldry as
(4:13) adoption and stepparenting is essentially essentially the same concept. In fact in the days of old to
(4:19) be married to a woman with children was to adopt those children. The basic idea is that offspring which aren't yours you
(4:25) are willing to provide resources for and love them. Rendering aid to any child in fact would be cuckoldry as a sharing of
(4:32) your resources with a child would be exactly what a cuck or cuckled is doing by being a steparent. But there's
(4:38) actually more. If a woman has children who are adults and no longer live with her, is the stepfather still a cuckled?
(4:44) He isn't sharing any resources at all, for instance. What about if a woman pays all the bills and takes care of all the
(4:49) responsibilities and not the man? Would he still be a cuckled? If the issue is that uh his meaning of the word is that
(4:56) a cuckled is a man who sleeps with a woman who has children from another man, that also presents logical issues. For
(5:02) instance, what if she's a widow? Is he still a cuckled? What if the woman was pregnant with multiple babies but
(5:08) aborted them all? Is he still a cuckled? If the answer to any of these is yes, the logical extension is that just
(5:14) sleeping with a woman who has slept with any other man but you makes you a cuckled, which would likely include most
(5:20) of my audience and his. Also, what if she gave another dude a [¬†__¬†] before you were with her? Is that still
(5:26) cuckled? I'm interested in a good faith debate on this, uh, though I don't think I'll get one. I'm still going to try to,
(5:32) though. Ultimately, it was pretty clear to me that Undead doesn't really know very much about me or my content and
(5:38) rather defers to what other people say, which I think he should know better than to do. I never had any actual issues
(5:43) with the guy, but he seems to have some with me. My guess is that this will basically just be kind of a personal
(5:49) insult character attack, and we won't really get into the topic very much. With that, my opening is done.
(5:55) All right, the floor is open, gentlemen. So if a man watches another man
(6:01) impregnate his wife and willingly raises the kid, he knows the kid isn't his. Is
(6:06) he not a cuckle? Yeah, he would be if he's getting enjoyment or entertainment from watching another man impregnate his wife. Yeah.
(6:13) Okay. Okay. Yeah. So adoption, that's a very interesting point. Well, hang on. Can we stay on the on the
(6:18) first point? Yeah, sure. What you going to say? So to to start with that, you wouldn't disagree with me that a man who would
(6:25) get enjoyment and not just their wife, girlfriend, whatever, uh from watching another man have sex with their
(6:31) significant other, whoever that was, would be a cuckold, right? Yeah, that's probably the peak, that's the, you know, definition of cuckled.
(6:38) Yeah. Would you agree with me that if you were to ask maybe walk down the street and ask a thousand people what cuckled meant, that that would be the
(6:45) meaning most of them thought it meant? Probably. Yes. Yeah. Okay. All right. Yeah. Yeah. But we can go to topic two.
(6:51) Yeah. So for adoption, uh, you're giving resources to another man's child. Yep.
(6:57) Yeah. It's probably somewhere on Cuck Mountain. I don't see it as bad as, you know, marrying a single mother, willingly giving your
(7:04) No, now I do I do have an audio clip here of you saying that you would be willing to adopt.
(7:09) Yeah. Well, that kind of changes. That's in flux. But if I mean, if you would be willing to adopt, are you then admitting that
(7:15) you would be willing to be a cuckold? Well, I have to pay taxes, so I'm forced to be a cuckold on that on that. Yeah. But even if we're going to use a
(7:21) tier, I So, let me kind of reject a couple categories. I would say that force coercion wouldn't
(7:27) make you a cuckold. So, for instance, if like men broke into your house on Dead Chronic and they you were like holding
(7:33) your wife and they held you right at at, you know, at gunpoint and then they did things to
(7:40) your wife in front of you. I don't think that that would make you a cuckold because that was coercion and force. I
(7:45) think that there has to be like a um you know some type of participation in the
(7:50) watching and viewing, right? Yes. Yeah. So I I don't think that taxes for instance, if you're if you're making the
(7:57) statement that that's done under under coercion, which I'm I'm sure you would, I don't think that would make a person a
(8:02) cuckold, right? But if a man gets cucked and doesn't know about it, he didn't consent to it and he's raising another man's kids,
(8:08) he's still cucked. Yeah. Well, I think that that's the itemology of the word is I would agree with you. So if a if your wife stepped
(8:15) out, got pregnant, and then you unknowingly raised that kid, I would agree that that's cuckled. Yes.
(8:21) So I would agree that that's the baseline mology and that watching another man have sex with your girl on
(8:27) purpose would also fit that mimmology. So I don't think consent really really affects whether someone's getting
(8:33) cucked. Well, I think that consent is the whole basis for it because you're not consenting to raise the kid that isn't
(8:39) yours. You don't know it. So you're otherwise you would retract consent if you did know. That was the whole point.
(8:45) Like that was the whole point, right? So if a king had a had like a queen and she
(8:50) decided to like [¬†__¬†] the bard and she got pregnant by the bard uh and then she had the kid, he unknowingly raised that
(8:57) kid. Uh he would be cuckleded, right? So but if he had known, he would retract
(9:02) consent. But today we have cuckled to consent. Yeah. Yeah. So, I think that that's the
(9:07) pornographic um like the the the pornographic idea of it and the porn
(9:13) industry coined that term and yeah, I would agree that that fits the itemology of the word because this they're
(9:19) fetishizing that happening to them. So, I I do think that people can get cucked with or without their consent.
(9:25) Like, I'm getting cucked. I don't want to be cucked by paying taxes, but I'm getting cucked.
(9:30) Yeah, but why if if it's done through coercion, I don't understand that.
(9:35) That's like saying so like for instance if a woman were to be you know like you
(9:40) know essay for instance you wouldn't you wouldn't hold that against her like she didn't there was
(9:46) nothing she did wrong she was just like jogging down the street and that happened to her um you wouldn't say that that's a sex
(9:51) partner right you would say that that was like this horrible thing that happened without her consent right sure but it was still a sexual activity
(9:58) yeah I wouldn't disagree that that there was sex involved in it I'm just saying that uh I think I think that what makes
(10:04) that the essay A is the consent. And I think that that would be the same thing with cuckoldry that both both types are
(10:10) based around consent. Either consent to watch the woman do this or uh no consent to raising the other
(10:17) child. Yeah. So there's levels to the cuck mountain. And consent is not really you
(10:22) can't say I didn't consent I didn't get cucked. You can't say I consent I didn't get cucked. Consent doesn't really
(10:28) doesn't really determine whether or not you're getting cucked. Well, I think it if if you were to instance um if you
(10:34) were to find out that um uh or or you had wanted your wife to screw another
(10:41) guy and get pregnant, that wouldn't fit the idea of cuckoldry, at least not the
(10:47) the base word of cuckoldry, because the whole idea there is I did not consent to this and you made a cuckled out of me,
(10:54) right? I'm now raising a child that is not mine. Um and I assumed that it was. I think
(10:59) it's the consent issue that is the big issue. Yeah. I'd still call him a cuck. I still
(11:05) think that fits the spirit of the word. Now, we got these old definitions. You got new definitions. You have, oh, well,
(11:12) it was this. You're some birds. I think most men would agree letting your wife get pregnant willingly from another dude
(11:20) is some cuck [¬†__¬†] Yeah, I agree. I wouldn't disagree with that.
(11:25) Okay. So, when I did my opening statement, you said there was a lot of similar arguments, attacks, haterade,
(11:32) whatever it was, and I don't know you. I don't know you. Where was I wrong? Because I don't want to be wrong if I say you married a single mother and that
(11:37) was true. No, that's true. That's true. I did I did marry a single mother. I'm not sure how that um relates to cuckoldry. Unless
(11:46) if if all you're saying here is that is that uh all of us are cucks to some degree and I'm just in some kind of
(11:52) higher tier of couck than you are even though you're also a cuck. Then I mean it just it just doesn't seem
(12:00) like it's um that it's an argument with merit really. Well, I'm I'm trying to say that higher
(12:05) level cucks shouldn't be telling young men how to live their lives. Well, I don't tell anybody how to live their life.
(12:11) You don't preach? You don't? No. I have no ministry of whatsoever. Oh, well that's an attack. Okay. Sorry
(12:17) about that. Yeah. What do you do mostly besid because I've only seen you attacking hookers online.
(12:22) Oh, from whatever. Yeah, that's whatever clips. Yeah. So, I go on whatever. That started a few
(12:27) months ago. I go on anytime they ask me to guest on there. And sometimes we have interesting conversations and sometimes
(12:32) debates break out. Occasionally they're theological in nature, but um like my rule is not to ever give advice. Even
(12:39) though people DM me for it all the time. I literally tell them I don't give advice. It's a bad idea to give people advice because I don't know anybody's
(12:45) personal situation. And I feel like I could actually give somebody the wrong advice and it would lead them the wrong way and then I would be to blame for
(12:52) that. Yeah, that's a tricky situation. I mean, I'll give advice, but it's stuff like uh
(12:57) no him, no diamond, don't marry a single mother. Go to the gym. Very basic stuff. That's all good advice.
(13:04) Yeah, but if some, you know, someone will call in, they'll be like, "Yo, Chronic, I got this girl. We've been dating for 5 years. I love her, but she
(13:11) has body count of three. Should I No, no diamond out of there. It's like, look, bro, that's your life, man. I'm not
(13:17) gonna tell you to do to to do that. I'm saying this is what So, I mean, but doesn't that kind of get to a lot of the core of the issue, too,
(13:22) which is every single situation is going to be different. And while I agree with you, um I agree with you that probably a
(13:31) woman who is chased and who is a virgin would probably be optimal for most men.
(13:36) There's less baggage, there's less all kinds of things. But you know these guys who are in their 30s or in their 40s
(13:41) they have they all have different situations and not every woman who's a single mom is a bad person. Though I
(13:46) will admit that the rate of women who become single moms on purpose has now caused significant problems in regards
(13:52) to feminism. Um but like every situation is going to be different. So it's very difficult
(13:58) even for you to um to kind of broad uh broad brush it any more than me. That's why you probably take it on a situation
(14:05) by situation basis. Yeah. I think when it comes to a single mother, I would always say no.
(14:11) But people What if she was a like what if she was a widow? No. No. Cuz there's a woman up there without kids.
(14:18) Yeah, that's true. But like what if the guy What if you know like modern women what I learned from whatever going on
(14:23) there so much is that modern women [¬†__¬†] suck. And it doesn't necess it
(14:28) doesn't necessarily matter. I agree with you. Yeah. Like it doesn't really even seem
(14:34) to matter. uh they have kids, they don't have kids, this and that. Like they're all kind of entitled, obnoxious brats,
(14:42) uh for the most part, very um very ungrateful brats. And um you know, the
(14:47) thing is is like I'm not so sure that even advising even if the woman has no
(14:53) kids, she probably had four abortions, right? It's like I don't it's hard to it's hard to give anybody advice and the
(14:58) dating market is completely [¬†__¬†] I wouldn't even know what to do with it. Like if I was one of these pickup artists, I'd probably just give up,
(15:05) dude. Yeah. You know, um so funny thing you tweet, you uh DM' me. You said something like I the date got cancelceled and they
(15:11) said debate. I thought of the pickup artists I beefed with in the past. These dudes would legit sell a spot for a Streamyard date
(15:20) and some some supporter would would get on the Streamyard and they' have a a date with some probably Only Fans girl
(15:26) for like 30 minutes and then the next two hours would be four pickup artists like ripping the guy apart on how he
(15:32) didn't hold frame. And so when you said that I because I know you didn't do it, that was some funny [¬†__¬†] in my mind.
(15:38) Yeah. Well, I've seen um I I've actually uh debated with a lot of pickup artists, debated with Destiny, Matt Dylan, a lot
(15:44) of the bigger debate names. I only actually go on whatever occasionally, but I mostly do debates with highle
(15:50) personalities. Um those are obviously a lot more fun to do. Uh like for instance, I the the way I found out
(15:57) about you was when you were kind of uh just going at Hunter Avalone, which I thought was [¬†__¬†] hilarious, right? Um
(16:04) you know, I was the one who broke that story. I broke that story on the uh on the Hunter Avalone thing. I was the
(16:09) one that his wife was doing this with all these dudes. Yeah.
(16:14) Yeah. That was gross. Yeah. Kingston emailed me, but I was like I'm not sure if this is legit andor legal. So, I just
(16:21) I let it I let it sit in my email box. Then he made the video the next day. Yeah. Yep. Yep. That was uh that was
(16:28) [¬†__¬†] wild. But yeah, I mean for the Yeah. Go ahead, sir. I say, "Did you see Hunter Avalone on Twitter begging for donations to get
(16:34) shared custody? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I did. Well, actually, I tweeted about it. It's like because it
(16:41) was really funny. He had this tweet that went out with um he he had done a debate with Fuentes and he was like, I'm over
(16:47) here living the Trad life, right? And so I tweet up I put that tweet up side by
(16:53) side with his I need money. I need money for custody. It's so bad. Well, part of
(16:59) me wants to feel bad for him, but just how he's acted over the years. It's I
(17:04) I'd like to see it. I like I'd like to see leftist cuckolds. Well, he got
(17:09) cucked, but he's not a willing cuck. I like to see leftists get destroyed by the family court in public.
(17:15) Yeah. Well, I you know, the thing is though is maybe I have different motivations for that. I'd prefer to see
(17:20) them come over to our side. So, the leftists, they're not stupid, right? They're just misguided. And I
(17:27) think uh I think when [¬†__¬†] like that happens and they suddenly have to engage in the real world in real world consequences, they begin to move away
(17:33) from that more into the right-wing sphere. Yeah. Could I interrupt, gentlemen?
(17:40) I feel like you guys should be cracking a beer open and just barbecuing or something. This has turned into like a
(17:46) nice conversation. You found a lot of agreement points. Well, a lot of people when they get
(17:53) invited to a debate or discussion, they'll watch some of my content because my content like when I'm streaming or
(17:58) I'm making response videos, very costic, very toxic. Um, but when I want to have
(18:04) a when someone's willing to have a conversation with me, I'm not going to just call them a a goddamn cuckle and
(18:10) laugh at it. I I still think marrying a single mother makes someone more of a cuckled than not, but it's like, what
(18:17) are we going to do? Am I gonna repeat my arguments five times? He's gonna do it and then I'm gonna get angry and call him a cuck boy. Then that's not really
(18:23) productive in my mind. Yeah. I would I would still say though
(18:28) um the the the problem if you have a word which alludes to this this um this idea
(18:35) of cuckoldry and it just means basically anybody doing anything to you that you
(18:41) just don't want them to do to you. Then that just basically makes everybody on planet Earth a cuckled.
(18:47) Yeah. Well, I like to use cucketry. Would I call you a cuckold? No. Would I
(18:53) say you are you marrying a single mother is engaging in cucketry? Yes, I would.
(18:59) Um, but if I was getting taxed, that would be cuckree. Oh, yeah. Well, it's a different level of cucketry, right? We're getting we're
(19:05) all getting cucked by the government. Yeah, but I mean, how do we ascertain what the levels here are? Isn't it? And
(19:10) she's just kind of using intuition for this. Like, I feel I feel like this is more more
(19:15) cuckled. That's why when I when I use it mmology, I'm trying to look at the root of the word and I'm trying to discern what category
(19:21) it goes in. So every word is going to point to a meaning and a category. So if we use the word, we're pointing to the
(19:28) meaning in the category, it seems like it's very much sexual and is very much related to offspring. But if we just kind of take that
(19:34) itemology away and say just anything anybody ever does against your will is cucketry,
(19:40) uh then I I think that we've just lost what the word meaning is. Yeah. I think calling someone a cuck or
(19:47) saying they are engaging in cuckatry is not the same as saying they're a cuckold. Cuckled I like to reserve for
(19:53) you know the Murphy's. Okay. So, okay. So, let me let me make sure I got it right then. So, cuckled we
(19:59) would agree is going to be like Jack Murphy. He's a cuckled and we would agree like a king who
(20:05) raised a prince that the bard had actually sired and he there was no paternity test. That would be a cuckled
(20:10) too. So, we have those two things would be cuckled. Yes, but you know it's when it comes to what's worse. It's like
(20:17) cockatry is like temperature. Everything has a temperature. Okay. It's a scale. You know, just because I say um you
(20:23) know, this table has a temperature of what is it? 72 degrees doesn't mean that ice doesn't also have a temperature.
(20:29) Yeah, I agree with that. It's more of like a I think I see cockatry as more of a It seems to me like it's just two
(20:34) categories. We're talking about two different categories. So when we say cuckled, we're both agreeing on what that category is. And then when we say
(20:40) cockatry, your definition of cockatry is basically anything uh which is done to
(20:47) you the person that uh you didn't want done to you. That would be it's I would I would say it's any
(20:55) transfer of resources from a man Mhm. to another man's offspring. That's what
(21:01) I would say. So like Okay. So really though, because like if you're let's say you're a soldier in a foreign war and you give a
(21:07) kid a candy bar, that's cockatry then. Yeah, that's a good point. Let me think
(21:12) let me think of a a better because is there is a sexual nature of it, right? Yeah, I think there has to be I think
(21:18) there has to be donating you know like donating to like uh some food aid, donating for I don't
(21:24) know like shoes to some homeless kid. That's obviously not cuckree, right? So like in like if you if you
(21:30) were go back to old Roman Empire when they like let kids die of exposure and you rolled out if you if you had a
(21:36) time machine you went back and you like save that kid from dying you wouldn't call that cockatry right
(21:42) no but I would say if you married a woman with a bunch of kids and you raised those kids and you spent your
(21:48) life's energy raising those kids instead of having more of your own kids that's cockatry. What if you did both?
(21:56) both as in like raising someone marrying and raising someone else's kids and donating and you had your own
(22:01) and had your own then you're less I'd not say you're less cut than someone that didn't have any of their own but compared to the version of
(22:08) you that had all your own children you're more cuck than that version is. Okay. So, uh when we're talk so when
(22:15) we're talking about cockatry then we're going to we can at least exclude some category. So like just providing
(22:21) resources for kids that aren't yours isn't going to fall under that category because that wouldn't make sense. Yeah. A soldier giving a candy bar to a kid in
(22:26) a war zone is not going to be we're not going to consider that cuckatry at all. Yeah. I would say if it's if it's not at
(22:32) the expense of your own children or future children. Yes. It's not cockatry. Okay. So then the widow argument would
(22:38) stand. So then if um if a widow died and her children died, let's say before you
(22:44) met her, there would be no allocation of resources. So that could not be cockatry.
(22:49) So what are you doing with this widow? Because she's dead. just necroily. No, no, no, no, no. She's the widow.
(22:56) Okay. There's a widow and her kids had died. Kids are dead and her husband died. Yeah. Oh, and the kids. Well, then you're not
(23:02) transferring any resources to her kids cuz they're dead. So, that's not cockatry.
(23:11) I'd say it's not overt cockatry. I think anything worse than anything that's not No, no diamond on some level is a little
(23:19) bit cuckish. Yes, I think that is. But it's Yeah, you're a cuck because you married a widow. I I wouldn't.
(23:26) Yeah. So, so even sleeping with a woman who slept with a with a a man before
(23:31) you, you're still a cuck. If you're giving her money and providing for her, it's worse than no hammer, no
(23:36) diamond. So, the only way essentially somebody would not be practicing cockatry is if
(23:41) they married a virgin. Yeah. But yeah, I'd say that. But you're still getting taxed. But willingly
(23:48) participating, willingly doing everything you can. You're willingly like marrying a chick who has slept with
(23:53) like seven guys in a lifime. That's that's some seasoning of cuck flakes on top. Yeah.
(23:58) So that's cockatry. Yeah. That's Joseph by this but by that logic though, Joseph
(24:05) who is the stepfather of God would be a [¬†__¬†] Sure.
(24:11) You I mean you you are I think you're a Christian, right? Yeah. But I'm not I'm not attacking
(24:17) Joseph for being a cuckle. He he consented to raising the father of God.
(24:22) And I'm not comparing people who marry single mothers to a dude whose wife gave birth to a Messiah. Yeah. That's
(24:30) Yeah. But he didn't know he didn't know that that was the Messiah first. So she came she came from a convent um and was
(24:38) betrod to him and was pregnant before she knew that that was the Messiah. Didn't an angel tell him it was going to
(24:43) be the Yeah, but she he had already known she was pregnant by that time. Yeah, sure. I'd say that.
(24:50) So he So he's a You think he's a [¬†__¬†] He's higher on the mountain of cockatry
(24:56) than a man who didn't consent or a man who didn't have
(25:01) to raise this immaculate conception. Yeah. So I mean again I think I think
(25:08) that we just have to category error. So I think we agree on the first category of what a cuckold is. And I think that
(25:13) the second category is um this kind of this word you came up with of cucketry
(25:18) which essentially just kind of alludes to anything in which a man is utilizing resources as you described um towards
(25:26) other people's children. But there's then caveats to that where okay not in a war zone though or not if you like find
(25:33) them on the ground and there's no parents around even though you' be raising the kid then not for adoption. So it's not really clear to me what the
(25:40) criteria for cockatry is. It's a fun word, right? Like I'm going to use it now. I'm going to totally it from you
(25:45) and use I'm stealing it and I'm using it because it's a fun word. But I I'm I'm just I'm not clear. I'm
(25:52) still not really clear everything that would go in that category as all. Do you think do you think any of your
(25:58) children are the Messiah? No. Probably. Probably not. Yeah, I would say no. Um you willingly chose a woman with
(26:05) other man's kids. Yep. To marry and have kids with and give resources to raise those kids. Yeah, that's true. That is a much higher
(26:11) level of cockatry than a man who was told by an angel that his wife is pregnant with the Messiah.
(26:17) Yeah, I get it. But it's still just going to fit under this criteria of cockatry. Whether there's different levels of it or like I would say there's
(26:23) different levels of essay. You can say there's different levels of essay like penetrative, non-penetrative,
(26:29) um some which are likely far more horrible than others. This type of thing, but it's all going to fall under the same category. And I'm just not
(26:35) clear everything that would fall under this category of cuckety. So if you say okay stepfathers are going to fall under
(26:42) that okay why well because you're giving resources to someone else's kids like okay but I can give you many many
(26:48) examples of people giving resources to other people's kids where that doesn't fall under cucketry and you kind of agree with that
(26:54) if the resources that you give away do not inhibit the resources that can go to
(26:59) your own children. So you said a lollipop in the war right? Yeah. I mean that that still could I
(27:06) mean like if you if you give to a children's do charity, you know what I mean? That's going to take away resource
(27:12) from your own kids. Yeah. If you if your kids are if your kids can't afford, you know, new shoes
(27:18) and you're donating to give shoes to inner city kids, you are a cuckle. Yes.
(27:23) That's cuckry, too. Well, what if they what if you can't afford it for them and you have a little bit left over, but
(27:28) they're not going to like they're not going to get the nicest shoes and then you're going to split those resources and ordinarily they could have nicer
(27:35) shoes, but you split the resources and then give that to children's charity. Is that still cockatry?
(27:41) Are we talking like what kind of shoes are we talking about? Are kids like using water bottles?
(27:46) No. No. They they they have like regular serviceable shoes, but they're not like they're not really highrade and you
(27:52) could get them high grade. It's just that you choose to get them kind of normal shoes and then split it or you choose to get them like maybe not the
(28:00) nicest toys around and then split it and then give the rest of it to like a children's charity. I would say that those that children's
(28:05) charity, the resources you give to them, there's definitely other parts in your child's life that could benefit from
(28:10) those resources besides shoes. Okay. Well, then let me ask you this. Um, you I I'm I understand that you work
(28:18) in the medical field and um I'm I'm guessing that you have tons and tons of patients who come in
(28:25) who you take care of who have forms of state assistant, Medicaid, Medicare, things like that, right?
(28:30) Yeah. Let's say I'm not directly involved with the patient care, but let's Yeah, sure.
(28:36) Okay. So, you're not you're not like providing the surgeries and this kind of thing, but but if you if you were Well, I don't know. I'm making an assumption.
(28:43) I don't know. You can. But but anyway, so you're you're providing this care by the state paying you to do that.
(28:50) Doesn't that make any of those children you provide the care for cuckled by you? Aren't you basically cucking them?
(28:56) I'm cucking the kids by providing medical services to them. Is that what you said?
(29:02) Yeah. because it's coming from the state from other No, I think that I think the people which is everybody paying taxes to fund
(29:08) Medicare and Medicaid are getting cucked because illegals will go into the
(29:13) hospital and get basically free health care. I'm just profiting off of the cockatantry system.
(29:20) So you So you're participating in the cockatree system. Yeah. I mean every you pay taxes, you're participating.
(29:26) I mean I I tend to agree. I'm just I'm trying to figure out all of the kind of dimensions to what cockatry would
(29:31) entail. So, if a person were to take their wife um to the hospital, let's say,
(29:38) yes, or I'm sorry, let's make it even easier. Take their their um their kid to the
(29:43) hospital and um and then says, "Okay, can you provide care for this kid?" And
(29:50) then he pays you to provide care for the kid. Is is he that's not cuck.
(29:56) I'm getting paid for a service. Yeah, I know. But he if my job is to uh let's say my job is
(30:01) to remove uh wasp stingers from kids and I'm getting paid to do that.
(30:07) Now another guy is sitting in the ER and he looks over and says, "Oh man, that
(30:12) sucks. I'm going to pay that kid's bill." He's a [¬†__¬†] Yeah, he paid taxes. Yeah, you're you're
(30:19) if you pay taxes, you pay for the health care of millions of illegals jump in the border with horrible health problems.
(30:25) We're getting cut by taxes. No, no. I'm saying if if if a if a guy's in the hospital, you treat you treat the
(30:32) kid, right? His kid. Yes. And uh and he's like, "Oh, man. This this this co-pay is killer, you know, or
(30:39) whatever. Uh this this bill is killer." And somebody in the hospital looks over and says, "Hey, you know what, man? It's
(30:44) around Christmas time. I'm going to pay for that bill." He's a [¬†__¬†] Does he have kids? Are the kids?
(30:50) Yeah, he has kids. Yeah. Do the kids have medical bills that need to be paid? Well, I mean, maybe not, but any form of
(30:56) resources which he would provide necessarily is going to be resources that his kids aren't going to have, right?
(31:05) Yeah. I think it is more cut than not doing it on the level
(31:10) of cuck mountain cockatry, right? But I don't necessarily think that
(31:15) charity towards someone's kid willingly
(31:21) unless it hurts your like what are the kid it goes on a deeper level like what what is his kids eating are his kids
(31:27) eating modern American food are there is there a hormone system they have they have a healthy diet and
(31:33) this and that but kind of regardless of what their personal circumstances would be whether they were well taken care of
(31:38) or not well taken care of necessarily if this guy takes care of this other kids bill that is going to be taking
(31:44) resources away from his kids. That's like an entailment of that. Think of it. Yeah, that is cockatree. How is this kid going to buy a house
(31:50) when it's a million dollars for a house? He could have taken those resources and put it away. Yeah. So, I mean I I don't I don't
(31:56) really think we have much to um I don't even think that we have much in the way
(32:02) to disagree with here. If the second criteria for this if of cucketry is so broad that it would entail even acts of
(32:08) charity and we're all just kind of cucks then I I guess I just don't give a [¬†__¬†] I think on the other end of cuck
(32:13) mountain is self being selfish, right? Because obviously most people would be
(32:18) like, "Hey, paying for some kid's cancer treatment doesn't make you a cuck." I'd say, "Well, putting that money away for
(32:24) your kids' house would probably be more useful to the kids." And someone like, "Dude, you're a selfish asshole." I'm like, "Yeah, probably. Yeah, I'd agree with that."
(32:30) Okay. Well, then I guess I guess all of us engage in cucketry and uh to some
(32:36) degree and some and many of them do it on purpose for the purpose of charitability and then we don't really disagree on what a cuckled is. So I
(32:42) think I think the debate's been resolved. Some people will marry a woman with children and I find that a level of cockatry I
(32:51) would not accept. Okay. I don't really know where to take it
(32:56) from there. there. I don't need it.
(33:03) It was 40 minutes. It wasn't even 40 minutes. Uh, Undead Chronic, did you
(33:09) ever have any other points of contention? I just wouldn't let my son marry a
(33:14) single mother. I'd probably strangle him before that. That's fair. That's fair. Well, I mean,
(33:20) gentlemen, I don't want to eat up any of more of your time. If you're both uh satisfied with the response and and all
(33:27) set, we can end on closing statements. Well, I just say it's nice to meet you. Uh this was um this was kind of a breath
(33:33) of fresh air debate. I felt like you were very good faith and answered the questions that I had for you and uh
(33:38) appreciate that. I just I think that we're kind of having a semantic argument and I think semantics are important to
(33:44) arguments. Um, and I think that you have just kind of made this category error of
(33:49) a cuckold tree is X and then cucketry is Y and you fall everybody falls in in
(33:55) some way to this category Y, but we agree on category X. So, I mean, I don't
(34:01) really if that if that's all it means, then I guess I just don't have an issue with it. I think climbing the mountain
(34:07) to go closer to being a cuckled is a bad thing to do. And I think you got your
(34:13) Patagonia on and you're hiking and I'm at the bottom of mountain like bro stop. But I mean at this point it's like dude
(34:20) divorce your wife. Like that's not that's not going to you know there's no there's no fix to this. It's more young
(34:25) men don't marry single mothers. Yeah. But I wouldn't be I don't think that that's bad advice.
(34:31) Yep. That's advice I would generally agree with. In fact, the the people I see more
(34:36) giving that advice out nowadays than anybody else are single mothers who've been through the the ringer in the system and go, "Wait, I really [¬†__¬†] up
(34:43) here." So, that's uh at least that's the turn that I'm starting to see. But, you know, feminism is entrenched, so who knows?
(34:49) Who knows how it'll go? But anyway, that's all I have for my closing statement. Appreciate it. Uh closing for you, Undead Chronic.
(34:57) Man, [¬†__¬†] you for making me agree with you. Sometimes I wanted to yell Was
(35:05) that it for you? I don't really have anything else. It's just lifestyle differences. I think that
(35:12) marrying single mother and I we just had we just talked about it. So that's pretty much
(35:17) that's fair. Well, let me just Well, all right, guys. Um I got to get
(35:22) prepared for another podcast tonight. Sarah, thank you again for having me on your stream. I appreciate you doing the leg work for this. It was very kind of
(35:28) you. You guys have a wonderful night. Thanks, Andrew. And Undead, if you want to leave as well, that's fine.
(35:35) And thank you for coming on and entertaining. I appreciate it. See you and bye.
