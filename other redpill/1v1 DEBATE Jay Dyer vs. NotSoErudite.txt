(1:49) closing statement and uh Jay we're going to have you give your opening statement first go ahead thank you for joining us
(1:54) thanks Brian appreciate it yeah so I take the uh position that feminism is absolutely destructive to society the
() 
(2:02) only healthy society that we can have is a patriarchal society if you look at the history of the world history of
(2:08) civilizations we notice that the the natural formation the natural structure
(2:13) that all societies almost across the board maybe a few tribal societies have had in matriarchy but most societies
(2:20) fall into some form of natural hierarchy hierarchies found in nature we see it in the animal kingdom we see it in the
(2:27) manimal kingdom that we inhabit and when we look through history we find certain civilizations have flourished
(2:33) particularly with a worldview or a philosophy that gives it its social cohesion the longest running
(2:39) civilization in history the most successful the most prosperous was Bzanthium bzantium was an Orthodox
(2:46) Christian imperium dating back to the time of Constantine all the way up into the 1400s when it fell to Islam due to
(2:53) liberalization due to forms of modernization certain economic open borders policy shall we say that led to
(3:00) the decline of Bzantium so even in the most successful civilization in history
(3:06) in Bzantin we begin to notice that the liberalization of that society is what led to its decline and its eventual
(3:13) collapse and even falling to Islam if we fast forward to modernity we look at
(3:18) women's rights or the idea of the uh first wave of feminism feminism find its
(3:25) finds its origins in French revolutionary philosophy which led to the first wave I should say french French revol French revolutionary
(3:32) philosophy with Mary Wallstonecraft and others posit the idea of absolute equality in in society based around the
(3:39) principles of liberty equality fraternity all which were revolutionary at the time and sought to overthrow not
(3:45) just the church and not just the state or the monarchy or a patriarchal society but all society all revol all areas of
(3:53) life had to be revolutionized since that time we've had second wave feminism we've had third-wave feminism thirdwave
(3:59) feminism Interestingly which not many people know was actually funded by very wealthy powerful oligarchical elites in
(4:06) fact in the Rockefeller's authorized biography there's an entire chapter on Abby Rockefeller's funding of third-wave
(4:13) feminism and cell which was the most radical form of this this is really what
(4:18) prepared the way for the absolute insane degeneracy that we see in today's society western civilization in other
(4:24) words could not have gotten to the point that we're at had we not had first second and third wave feminism preparing
(4:31) the way for the absolute and total revolution against all natural order all
(4:37) biological order and the notion of patriarchy itself in fact many of the uh famous feminists over the last several
(4:44) decades have openly said that in order to destroy western civilization they would have to destroy the masculine
(4:50) archetype the patriarch that is God the father had to be destroyed to make way for the rise of the goddess etc all the
(4:58) various things that we see attending to or accompanying the revolution that is feminism if you look on my wall on X
(5:05) right now you'll notice at the very top is an interview that the famous director Aaron Russo did with uh a friend of mine
(5:11) Alex Jones and in that interview they discuss Aaron Russo's interview with Nick Rockefeller and Nick Rockefeller
(5:18) said that the greatest tool to revolutionize and control society was feminism modern feminism changed the
(5:24) landscape of getting women out of the house into the workforce quote so that they could be taxed and that there would
(5:31) be less children less families so we have from one of the key elites from the Rockefeller family admitting that the
(5:38) purpose of this was to change society reduce population tie it into neoliberal
(5:44) economics taxation on a mass scale for the population and thus it has been an absolute disaster and it has nothing to
(5:52) do with equality has to do with control it has to do with social it's dystopian has to do with social dystopian control
(5:58) putting us into a utilitarian technocratic society and I would say that this is all an attempt admittedly
(6:04) if you go back to people like early feminists like Wstonecraft or others throughout history Alexander Colintai of
(6:10) the [ __ ] Revolution they all speak about this as intimately tied into not just sexual revolution but the overthrow
(6:17) of masculinity ultimately the overthrow of the idea of God the father the ultimate patriarch and that's where we
(6:24) are today is in a society that has adopted revolutionary philosophy that is ultimately anti-male
(6:30) anti-biology anti-reality because they all go together in other words feminism cannot be divorced from the revolution against
(6:38) biology the revolution against masculinity the revolution against every area of life that is healthy wholesome
(6:45) and uh based around patriarchy
(6:51) all right thank you for that Jay uh Kyla would you like to uh give your opening statement though sure um mine isn't
(6:57) going to be nearly as long uh but that was I was really interesting and I basically would grant you lots of that
(7:03) stuff i would essentially argue that feminism is not only a necessity it's unavoidable i think that's where society
(7:10) tends to go uh I think women joining the workforce uh while there's lots of cons with it uh one of the biggest pros is
(7:16) the massive boost to GDP and just the competitiveness of every nation that includes women and overall I think
(7:23) feminism is broadly good for society but I am sure that I would be happy to talk with you about number of areas that I
(7:30) think have been harmful for society i think feminism has been co-opted and often twisted I think particularly in
(7:36) the third wave we saw this um by what I would call gender opportunists um and so
(7:42) when I think about feminism uh I'm more interested in a feminism that is
(7:47) centralized around uh empowering women and uh promoting femininity um I think
(7:54) when you talk about egalitarianism I think it's really interesting concept but I think we need to be precise in
(8:00) what we talk about so I guess to open I'd maybe start with a question um with
(8:05) your philosophy background i'm sure you're familiar um with Haidiger's concept of chatter
(8:11) um no okay so um Haidiger uh interesting
(8:16) philosopher from the 40s but he has this idea of chatter that I think is really interesting for discussion which is essentially how a lot of times when
(8:22) people have like philosophical and idea wrestling conversations they use the same word but they have different
(8:28) meanings for those words and so then the whole conversation is just essentially garbage that's what he calls like idol
(8:34) chatter and so I'm curious if what you'd be willing to do for this conversation is if we could make sure that we agree
(8:40) on what we mean by certain words so that we can actually talk about the ideas underneath them and hopefully come to a
(8:45) better understanding of everything what are the words you would like specified
(8:51) probably for this conversation we should talk about patriarchy and feminism those seem like the most obvious things to define um and then after that just if we
(8:58) come to a word that we keep both using it would probably just be useful to define it and make sure that we agree to what we're talking about if that works
(9:05) okay would you like to start with your definitions and then Jay can give his sure so see where you guys agree um yeah I'm curious so patriarchy I would define
() 
(9:12) it as a hierarchical structure where men monopolize soft and hard power
(9:18) um I think that they have authority i wouldn't say it's a monopoly on power
(9:23) because women can have a degree of influence and power in society but it's under the headship of a man so for
(9:30) example uh a job right um as an example Proverbs 31 talks about women being able
(9:37) to work but it's sort of under the purview of the husband so it's not independence it's not doing their own
(9:43) thing it's a family unit working together so there's roles sure so when
(9:48) we're thinking about like a job um so when I think about a hieropoly of hard and soft power in my
(9:56) mind I'm thinking law like kind of like men are mostly monopolizing positions in
(10:02) law but also soft power like media and kind of able to kind of set the tone
(10:07) culturally as well so they kind of have these uh areas of power mostly fully
(10:12) occupied by men um particularly systems where men force it to be the case that
(10:18) it's only men in those positions monopoly is a difficult term because it suggests totality and again there can be
(10:25) a shared uh situation here that's not a total monopoly but fine I'll go with it it's fine sure
(10:32) um we can say like a soft monopoly or something like that but essentially hierarchical structure where men tend to
(10:38) mostly occupy positions of power um feminism I define it as the empowerment of women and promotion of femininity do
(10:45) you agree with that or do you have a very different definition um I I think of it as something necessarily tied to
(10:51) revolution and I think when you say the word empowerment it's also ambiguous because that could be a lot of things in
(10:57) different context so I don't know what you think empowerment is okay so by empowerment what I mean is typically
(11:03) going to be uh I'm very big freedom of opportunity person liberal um guilty as charged so empowerment would be uh
(11:10) eroding any obstacles to um disadvantages or inabilities to take
(11:16) opportunities other people would have um that would be one way of empowering someone so for example uh there's a TED
(11:23) talk about 10 years ago and one of the ladies who was a diehard sort of CEO out
(11:29) of the academic world she went into academia and became a CEO she was bragging that most CEOs now this was
(11:35) again about 10 years ago are now women that we're reaching some tipping point that there's a large majority of women
(11:41) that are now CEOs do you think that's good is that fair because I would see
(11:47) that as a revolution against male authority i see it a I am very dubious
(11:53) of her claim a B I see it as like neutral i don't really I don't really
(11:59) care who trickles up to the top so long as the people who trickle to the top did so because there was free opportunity to
() 
(12:06) do so right so like in our societ I'm sure here's something we probably agree on most of the positions of power in our
(12:12) society are occupied men because men tend to be more extreme like they're just more extreme in bell curve like
(12:18) genetically um and they don't often take time away from work with kids so they have a little bit more time to dedicate
(12:24) so we see at the highest levels of trickling to the top men typically occupy those roles i'm sure you and I
(12:30) would agree yeah but when you say extreme again this is a very ambiguous term extreme in their views extreme on
(12:35) the belt i meant genetically like so because of the Yaxis specifically so I don't know if you know anything about IQ
(12:41) research for example i know about that so men um well like obviously the average IQ for men and women is 100 uh
(12:47) because it's normalized men tend to occupy a bit more of those extreme spaces they're both the lowest and the
(12:53) highest IQ um and we see men doing that all the time they tend to just have more
(12:59) extreme genetic traits both for success um and for struggling right that's why
(13:05) we tend to see men over represented on both sides of most things so that's why men often will trickle to the top of
(13:11) most workspaces for example and you think that's because of extremes of IQ
(13:16) uh well not just IQ that would be extremes of multiple things and also I think I said you said IQ a minute ago
(13:22) yeah IQ would be one thing i just don't think IQ is the only thing that would predict so what are the things that led
(13:27) men to be in those positions other than IQ um uh probably just the ability to work
(13:36) like they don't take time away from work for children their wife typically does it could there be anything biological
(13:41) well would that be biological iq would be something biological partly biological i'm saying like in terms of
(13:46) what a man is biologically is there anything is that anything to do with what might be roles in society hierarchy
(13:53) uh I don't think there's super good evidence that like testosterone predicts like anything other than like aggression
(14:00) towards those like equal or lower and like muscle distribution um I think it's
(14:06) a lot more going to be muscle distribution is part of biology right sure i just don't think like muscles get
(14:11) you to the top of a Fortune 500 what about like being a soldier does that help yeah okay that's why men are
(14:16) significantly better soldiers than women but what about that high IQ that group of high IQ does that help
(14:23) get them to the top of the CEO ladder that would definitely help i think it's like a 45% to 60% and you admit that
(14:29) that's partly genetic yeah of course okay so it seems like naturally speaking when I
(14:36) appealed to my opening statement to what's natural and biological men are just sort of fitted to those things
(14:42) their very constitution for those things yeah it's just with um in 2025 with women having birth control
(14:49) and tampons um there's less obstacles to that so they might trickle to the top too and I just want a society that would allow them to do so but why that's what
(14:56) I'm what I'm getting at is if this is biological and thus quote natural to a degree according to what you're arguing
(15:03) what's the need for women to do what is then perhaps not natural for them to do
(15:08) in society because there are lots of women that are still uh in the high IQ
(15:14) realm that are very capable that make excellent bosses so exceptions make the rule no more like freedom of opportunity
() 
(15:21) right that's my premise is I want it's like a it's like the innovator scale right i don't want to arbitrarily just
(15:26) say 50% of our society cannot be at the top of society because I want to make
(15:32) sure that if they're achieving the top of society it's because of skill and um
(15:37) like merit and etc etc that's what I believe in and so I wouldn't want to arbitrarily ban women from those
(15:42) positions right but it's not I didn't even talk about banning so that was something that you interjected what I said I'm not saying you did right
(15:48) because you were asking like what I'm interested in i'm saying a freedom of opportunity for women to just trickle so there's a there's a standard which you
(15:55) would say that's a better that's a a net good for society if women are able then to interject themselves into that male
(16:03) space that's a good Why is that a good uh like I said innovator skill what
(16:08) innovator scale more people means more innovators you just get the best of the crop more people so we should have more
(16:16) people in society uh sure i don't know if this is
(16:21) connected to birth right yeah because the more people in society would would then back up what you're arguing right
(16:26) but don't we don't we need more husbands and wives to have more people yeah i just don't think these things are mutually exclusive how can a a wife be a
(16:34) CEO and also raise the kids uh tampons birth control um like supporting so
(16:39) tampons and birth control raise the kids what do you mean um lots of lots of women find a way to both raise children
(16:45) and work well shared parenting like the husband takes roles sometimes they get babysitters sometimes there's
(16:51) intergenerational families there's multiple ways that women uh share the load of parenting so that's a net good
(16:57) uh it can be yeah okay what is the standard for good here uh do you mean like like at an epistemic
(17:05) level at any level uh good as in in your worldview what determines the good so in
(17:11) the in the case of what we're talking about I talked about the innovator scale so the reason I like women being able to
(17:16) have access to opportunity is because it improves GDP okay so the net good for
() 
(17:21) society is just what more fiat money like what what determines that yep gdp is a good thing
(17:28) do you disagree yeah I do first of all like what if the money is a scam that
(17:33) doesn't have anything to do with GDP why would not having more GDP for a country not be good the the nature of the money
(17:40) itself if the money system is a debt based scam doesn't have anything to do with GDP
(17:46) not really because GDP is about like the income of a country right so like debt is debt is part of how you navigate
(17:53) income of a country right but our country's income is presently based on
(17:58) pure debt right is that a bad thing our GDP is not based on debt no it is well
(18:04) the whole the whole system is based on debt gross domestic product is not itself debt i'm saying the economic
(18:09) system itself is based on debt yeah like it's a debt based system yeah like modern theory of like money is very debt
(18:16) organized it's just like debt is not this like bugaloo scary thing in and of itself no i'm talking about our system
(18:22) is fiat it's not attached to anything hard it's no there's no hard currency that our money is attached to since the
(18:28) shock doctrine of Nixon right so Nixon goes up the gold standard so we're now a debt based system so I'm just saying
(18:33) your highest quality was the best GDP in society so your organizing principle is
(18:39) a neoliberal economic theory so what I want to know is even if that's itself based on debt then what's the source of
(18:45) the good here the so in this case what is good for society is having a competitive GDP so that your enemies
(18:52) can't stall you that's the highest good that's not the highest good that's the good of what I'm talking about in the case of women entering what is the
(18:58) highest good that determines that that's good are you talking about morality just at all in your system you tell me what
(19:03) your system's standard of good is so it I'm I'm not really sure why we're having
(19:09) the epistemic conversation i just Why not because we're it feels like we're losing the plot of the conversation no I
(19:15) want to know what your standard of the good is again what do you mean by good
(19:20) you said that the GDP is necessarily attached to the highest good i didn't say highest good i said it's a good
(19:26) thing okay then I'm asking you what the highest good is that determines that the GDP is better than not caring about GDP
() 
(19:33) i have So you're asking for my moral foundation theory sure i'm a divine command theorist
(19:40) from what divine command um the Christian God and he says GDP is good no
(19:45) did Moses come down and say I don't think GDP is moral you just said it was the highest good for the highest good
(19:51) this debate no I said it's good for society then it's moral if it's good i
(19:58) don't think it's moral in this case if it's good it's moral well you can have good as in a moral claim well of course
(20:03) you can have functional claims right so if it's only functional or if it's only pragmatic then it's not ultimately a
(20:10) good it's just subjective so at a functional level it is I guess do you disagree with this idea that it's good
(20:16) for a state to have competitive high GDP it could be but I don't think it's the
(20:21) highest good and I have a standard of good so I'm trying to figure out what yours is well what's more important for a nation state than GDP uh the health of
(20:28) the society sure but if the health of society is really high I mean could you have let me let me give you an example
(20:34) could you have a society that's mass addicted to drugs but has a good number a nice income probably not no you can
(20:41) have societies that are full of detriment like full of ghettos and they're ruled over by uh organized crime
(20:49) that make a lot of money typically those countries like if you're thinking about like the Congo or like areas that have like high levels of corruption their GDP
(20:55) is horrible because typically crime is not good for GDP but I'm saying you could conceivably have that it doesn't matter whether there's some exception to
(21:01) that rule somewhere it's not exception i would say the rule is in general when you have lots of corruption and drug addiction it's not good for GDP but I'm
(21:09) saying conceivably you could have a ruling elite that makes a lot of money from drugs and the society itself is
(21:15) living in shanty town right i don't think that that nation state would have high GP i don't think there's any evidence it doesn't matter if you think
(21:22) that because it's conceivable that you could have that right you could have a successful oligarchy that that makes a
(21:27) lot of money and the people themselves don't do very well are you talking about like Saudi Arabia yeah sure sure but
(21:34) Saudi Arabia again is not nearly as competitive as somewhere like America or any how do we know that competitiveness
(21:40) for women is a good you've just said that that's the case because it increases GDP so I'll just break it down
(21:46) circle out of it's okay if we're going to do trigger Like what we can do a
(21:51) grippa tile it's just useless i can use it at you too right well but if I'm arguing for a moral ought on the basis
(21:58) of this is not a moral ought it is you said it's not a good if you say something I said it's functional what
(22:03) word okay we're doing chatter so you want me to use when I say functional no no in a debate if you're arguing for
(22:09) your position then you're necessarily arguing that we ought to follow your position um yeah i I think I said
() 
(22:16) necessity and unavoidable that doesn't mean it doesn't mean it's a moral claim it would be like real politic well then
(22:21) it's an ought because do you think we should we ought to follow your arguments not all are moral ought we follow your arguments uh as in like should you do
(22:29) what I prescribe for society ought we follow the true arguments versus the false arguments
(22:35) sure okay then you're using an ought right now to argue for your position
(22:41) sure but this isn't a moral claim you just argue that we ought to follow your position that's a moral claim it is it's
(22:46) not all how oughts are morals if you're extending them to everybody in the theoretical realm of listening to the
(22:53) debate do you think that it's moral or not moral to to have GDP do you think GDP is moral in your I'm pointing out
(23:00) that your answer question I have a different system than you so it's not going to apply to my system do you think that GDP is moral everything in life is
(23:08) conceivably or potentially moral how is GDP moral because you extended it to in
(23:14) this argument the highest good i did not you did walk it back after I asked for the highest good yes you did i did not
(23:20) for a nation state i guess it's like one of the higher goods yes it's not the highest good and I I've said so and what
(23:26) is the good J i don't know how to explain to you over and over that this is not a moral claim it's real pragmatism you're saying that but ought
(23:33) we follow your argument in pragmatism here uh if you want a flourishing society by and large so we ought
(23:39) logically sure but it's ought we logically it's Sure it's again it's not a moral claim it's not is GDP a moral
(23:46) claim it can be depending upon the system how is GDP a moral claim in your system you're arguing that what you just
(23:53) said we ought to follow your argument i don't know how many times to tell you this i'm not making a moral claim you
(23:58) are and you're saying you're not you're just keep telling me anytime you say that there's an ought that's not true
(24:03) that is true no it is no even if you redefine it as functional how about this you don't have to have a liberal society
(24:09) that has a high GDP you're just going to get stomped and you'll be a failed nation state it's it's neutral morally
(24:15) yeah but you're missing the point about highest goods for society you're arguing that I'm not engaging in that yet well
(24:21) I'm that's But that's Go ahead oh no just uh if you guys can try if you guys can just try to uh let each other finish
(24:28) your thoughts but go ahead so this debate necessarily comes down to
(24:34) metaphysical claims and epistmical claims and ethical claims no yes it does uh we feminism is about morals ethics
(24:43) biology society social relations you can't divorce ethics from that now if you think you can I'm happy to address
(24:49) that but that's just going to get you in an even deeper bind i'm not saying that you can't that you can divorce these things of course feminism you just
(24:56) argued a minute ago that it's not moral gdp is not moral then you can't divorce these things so you just contradicted
(25:01) yourself so there are lots of elements okay there are lots of elements within feminism that do make moral claims right
(25:07) lots of them when I'm talking about something like an innovator scale it's not a moral claim it's real politics i understand you think that but I'm
(25:13) pointing out that it is still moral that's the argument I'm making okay
(25:18) do you want to engage with the actual conversation now you saying that doesn't avoid the argument I'm making i know
() 
(25:24) that's what you're trying why is GDP not good for a society or is it i'm saying it depends on your standard of good and
(25:29) that's what I'm asking what's your standard of good i think GDP can be great for a society but it's not the highest good of society such as the
(25:36) social cohesion of society that's more important than who's making fiat money okay what do you think is the role of
(25:42) the nation state the nation state has the job and the
(25:47) duty to def defend its people and to uh maintain a healthy society to punish the
(25:54) wicked and to uh reward virtue sure yeah I would broadly agree it's to keep its citizens safe right um Okay how does it
(26:01) do that at a for I said reward virtue and punish vice so there's also necessarily an ethical component there
(26:08) sure that that's your your claim that's my worldview yeah i'm just engaging with it okay so then how does your nation
(26:14) state and your worldview uh protect itself from enemies it has a standing army okay and how does
(26:21) it fund that standing army well nations have gone into debt or they have been
(26:26) prosperous and used their own treasuries or they have raised money to go to war so there's a lot of different ways that
(26:31) could happen okay and so what do you think is the right way to do that
(26:37) um it's an oversimplification question because not everything in regard to warfare or history of civilizations is
(26:45) necessarily right or wrong it's a question of what might be the best or the worst so there can be scales it's not either or there are some things that
(26:51) aren't moral necessarily some of them are just pragmatic and then there's some things that are moral
(26:59) everything could potentially be moral but some things are pragmatic sure okay that's basically what I've been saying
(27:05) yeah but you were appealing to the good of a nation state you were again because you were using the word good in a way
(27:11) that I wasn't meaning it and even though I clarified multiple times that I meant functional and I even said what word
(27:17) would you like me to use to describe this i understand that you're you think that saying that because it's functional
(27:22) it removes the ethical domain but it doesn't is the point I'm trying to make because the question that we're debating
(27:28) is whether feminism is good for society or not that's an ethical moral okay so
(27:33) going back to the chatter thing how we have to agree about words okay you're now essentially assigning to me what
(27:39) good means and it's it's obvious that I'm not no I'm doing internal critique is what I'm doing you know what that is
() 
(27:44) assigning to me do you know what an internal critique is uh tell me so I'm criticizing your position on its own
(27:50) grounds that's an internal critique that's what happens in debates okay what word would you like me to use when I am describing this non-moral functional
(27:57) element that is the one that makes a non-moral position make sense of why feminism is a good for society we can
(28:05) get there but again we have to You're not going to get there well we can but you're not even you're not even like we're doing chatter we're literally
(28:12) we're doing the point where you don't understand the issue that's the point that's not true all you've done at this
(28:18) point is just like you've basically you've you're you're in you're just weaponizing tri group no you admitted
(28:23) that the debate is about whether feminism is good for society that's a moral ethical domain right there sure
(28:30) there are some moral elements so when you make arguments about GDP if it's not moral then it's not relevant to the
(28:36) debate it's absolutely moral what language would you like to use i said it's not there is moral elements and
(28:42) there are some non-moral elements gdp is the debate today about something moral
(28:48) uh I don't know if I agreed to saying we're only going to talk about epistemics and morality good is again
(28:56) this word that we're basically doing chatter around where you're assigning a label to it and I haven't agreed to I'm
(29:02) trying to figure out your position on the good my position on the good is it's holistic there are things that are good
(29:07) because it's functional and there are things that it's good because it's moral right is the debate today feminism about
(29:13) the good of the moral for society it's about I guess I would like to make the case for both the answer okay so if then
(29:20) that means that everything you've been saying for the last hour is wrong no because I'm making a case for the functional element too but the fact that
(29:27) you're making the case for the functional element too doesn't matter if you're also talking about the moral you
(29:32) can make both arguments and I would like to engage in the first one right because the other one is the one I'm looking at
(29:38) and that's the problem for you it's not the problem for me my no the problem with this conversation
(29:45) is that essentially what you've done is you've assigned me a bunch of positions that I don't have you've done a bunch of
(29:50) circle talk about words you've done a couple of rhetorical flashbangs and now we're stuck in the situation where we
(29:56) can't actually talk about the ideas which is unfortunate cuz I was really looking into a c you're chasing you're
(30:01) like one foot is nailed and then the other one is going in a circle like a cartoon you're like a cartoon character
(30:07) running in a circle if you want to like throw trig's trilmma at me you can but I
(30:12) can throw it at you too and if we do that then there's no point we're at an impass what do you think is good the
(30:19) good ultimately relates to God the highest good okay the highest good so is GDP in direction of that or not all
(30:26) things that exist are good in some way and in some way relate to morals but I do not believe that the GDP is the
(30:33) highest good for society okay what is the highest good for society the health and flourishing of the society which has
() 
(30:40) to exist within some kind of patriarchal norm that's the only way that it can function gotcha and the ones that don't
(30:47) they dysfunction okay and so in your mind does GDP contribute to any of that it's just one
(30:53) component of life just like I don't know the size of the the nation's land mass
(30:59) is one component sure I would agree with that but it's not the highest good okay
(31:05) got So what's the argument that feminism is good for society feminism is good for
(31:10) society at a functional level because it increases innovator scale i also think it's the right thing to do that's moral
(31:19) yep i'm giving you a moral claim now okay thank you and why is it right for society um I it is right for society
(31:26) because I think in general we should try to treat others well and I think limiting people's opportunity by force
(31:32) is bad for them i don't think God wants that okay what
(31:37) God the Christian one okay where does he talk about this um forcing people to do
(31:44) things no this idea of what the good is for society because we have a lot of historical Christian societies sure were
(31:52) any of them feminist uh no but I don't think in general that God advocates really strongly for a political system
(31:59) really no what about when Israel was organized was that a political system uh
(32:05) like in 1948 no in the Old Testament in the Old Testament uh was it a Yeah it
(32:11) was a political society mhm how was it organized i'm not a Jew what does it have to do with whether it was organized
(32:17) in a certain way or not it has nothing to do with my claim what does the Old Testament say about how God organized that society uh he gave them
() 
(32:23) prescriptions about how to run their life from Moses how was that society organized uh it was uh organized I
(32:29) believe in a patriarchal society with matrineal heritage and it was a monarchy
(32:35) uh yes a male monarchy yep okay so in that regard God was not feminist right i
(32:43) never said that God was feminist well I'm asking if there's a history example of where God organized a feminist
(32:50) society uh I mean it's interesting because when you look at like ancient Judeo history if you're not being
(32:56) presantist it was like insanely uh progressive compared to like the pagans
(33:02) around them like the Assyrians and Babylonians that's not what I'm asking well it it is what you're asking you're
(33:08) calling it progressive and I would just say it's healthy so the fact that they had the ten commandments God seemed to
(33:13) advocate to some degree for a better treatment of women than any other society around them but that's not feminism uh to some degree you could
(33:20) argue that it is if you agree with my definition which is like the empirical but your definition is so elastic and broad that it could be anything except
(33:27) for what my position is no I don't because I'm not agreeing that Old Testament patriarchal society is feminist you just admitted it's not if
(33:34) you're not agreeing why did we even define the words at the beginning of Can you name a feminist society
(33:39) that God advocated i'm not interested to you appealed to God yeah i think it's it's a good thing to treat women well
(33:44) did God ever That's not feminism now you're equivocating i'm not equivocating yes you are how am I equivocating
(33:50) changing the moving the goalpost is what feminism is completely different
(33:57) equivocating or am I moving the goalpost now it's both it's both you're equivocating on the word and moving the goalpost to make your position work so
(34:04) if there's no feminist if there's no feminist equivocating on the word that's
(34:09) not what equivocating i know what equivocation means yes it does it means that two different understandings of a
() 
(34:14) word you're equivocating on the word okay feminism and you're defining to say that if God in the Old Testament gives
(34:20) women rights that's feminism that's not what feminism is feminism is a modern movement postrevolutionary why did you
(34:27) agree to my definition of feminism because it's so broad that that's fine if you want to defend that against
(34:32) patriarchy but I'm arguing patriarchy against feminism and what you appeal to
(34:37) is moving the goalpost by the originally agreeing to a definition of feminism and now you're saying that can't work
(34:42) anymore because it's defeating my argument the Old Testament God and the New Testament God are the same God and
(34:49) they never institute a feminist society and women's rights or being made in the image of of God that women are protected
(34:56) now in that status what do you mean by feminism what do you mean by a feminist society a matriarchal society or a
(35:03) nonpatriarchal society i've never advocated for either of these things okay but feminism has never been a
(35:09) societal goal in the Old Testament or the New Testament or the history of any Christian society so you have no
(35:16) examples of this i haven't advocated for any of these things i don't need you appealed to God as your standard of the
(35:22) ought and the right the moral right yeah it's a moral thing to treat women and then I said give me the examples of
(35:27) where that God ever instituted anything like what you're talking about in terms of feminism and there's not there's not
(35:33) there is according to the definition you agreed to feminism yeah the empowerment and pro promotion of femininity judaism
(35:38) that is not what is happening in the Old Testament judaism is the most progressive approach to femininity of
(35:44) all of the modern rebbitic Judaism is not the same thing as what's in the Mosaic law you asked for old testament
(35:49) examples which I just gave you one that's not rabbitic Judaism you admitted that the it's a m it's a patriarchal society that's What do you mean it's not
(35:56) ra You don't think Old Testament Judeo like No it's not it's notic what are you
(36:02) talking about it's not the same thing as rebuild you think that the 1200 BC society that was erected by King David
(36:08) wasn't wasn't a rabbitic society rabbitic Judaism comes out of the fourth and fifth century when the then the
(36:14) Babylonian Talmud is collected and collated so you don't think that the Old Testament at all is not rabbitic no
(36:21) okay and it's patriarchal so even if it was
(36:26) rabbitic it wouldn't refute then there's no examples of what you're talking about well the the issue for me is that what
(36:32) you're what you're doing is you're creating a false dichotomy you're pretending like patriarchy and feminism can't coexist at the same time they
(36:37) cannot of course they can we live in one being feminine is not the same thing as
(36:43) the movement of feminism i didn't say that it is i said that we are you did you said that femininity is promoted in
(36:49) the Old Testament and you used that as a way to prove your position i said it empowered women and it promoted femininity it empowered women by
(36:55) creating matrinal lines of inheritance and it uh promoted femininity by making a whole bunch of female figures be
(37:01) viewed as these like incredible characters to like look up to like Ruth and Deborah and stuff like that okay well there's aent according to the
(37:07) definition you agreed to on feminism would be feminism then it wasn't quote progressive according to your view
(37:12) because other societies worship the goddess and that would be more progressive than what you said if you want we can go back an hour and we can
(37:18) redo chatter and you can make a new definition for feminism that you like more so that you can apply it more narrowly if you'd like you have moved
(37:25) the goalpost i have not on what feminism is i wrote it down you agreed to it
(37:30) anything that So is the goddess feminism uh I don't know what that is is goddess
(37:36) worship in the ancient pagan world is that feminism it might be i'm not sure i
(37:41) don't know i view so your position is so elastic that it could encompass any possible why did you agree to it it's
(37:48) unfa because the way you you framed it was anti-atriarchy and I'm fine with that i didn't frame it that way i did
(37:54) not frame it that The terms of this debate are an hour is feminism good or is patriarchy good i wrote it down do
(37:59) you want to go back the fact that you wrote it down just means that you wrote you misunderstand what you wrote down no that's even dumber the issue the issue
(38:06) rather than you just being bad faith for no reason no this is you don't know what you don't even know what an internal
(38:12) critique is so I'm not being bad faith i've been debating for 25 years completely it's completely fine to know what know what terms are right sure but
() 
(38:20) in terms of debate that's like 101 knowing what an internal critique is i I understand what like consistency checks
(38:26) are i just didn't use the language internal critique right so if we want to go back an hour you agree to this idea
(38:32) of chatter right how we want to define concepts agree to them so that we can talk about rattle or chatter
(38:40) i'm just kidding go ahead so if you agree to that and then you agree to the
(38:46) terms you can change them later i'm just going to be good faith you can change them later if you want to let's just go
(38:53) back to the terms again and narrow it down to what we can agree to of what feminism and patriarchy means because
(39:00) now all you're doing I gave a very precise definition for patriarchy right sure i did and you gave a very loose
(39:07) definition as to what you think feminism is which could encompass conceivably anything that helps women and that's an
(39:14) ambiguity fallacy then provide a different definition don't agree to it in my opening statement I said that I
(39:20) believe feminism is a revolutionary philosophy that destroys society it was
(39:25) brought about to change society in Toto and ultimately to serve into
(39:31) oligarchical designs and people who and I gave sources you can read the Rockefeller's authorized biography they
(39:36) have a whole discussion of Abby Rockefeller funding thirdwave feminism in cell how is this not just as
(39:42) ambiguous as the one it's just a revolution just as ambiguous i'm literally giving you the people who funded it and the actual names of the
(39:48) people like cell to authority right now none of this matters that's not an authority that's
(39:55) the people involved it's not an authority pill yeah if the people don't know what an authority is that funded them is an authority for the gave the
(40:02) people involved like Abby Rockefeller who was herself no it's not then why are you citing them it's a person who's in
(40:09) the movement it's not just the funer yeah you're appealing to authority you don't know what an appeal to that's a fact it's not an appeal to authority you
(40:15) don't know what an appeal to citing them or a definition of feminism yeah that's not an appeal to authority yes it is no
(40:21) it's not you don't know what an appeal to author if I said my position is true because I cite the Rockefellers that
(40:28) would be an appeal to authority and that's a fallacy this is an evidence goofus because of the Rockefellers if
(40:34) you want no I'm not i'm telling you the history of the movement which you don't even know about then I've asked you to
(40:41) define feminism and now and I'm giving you the history of that movement which is three waves are there three waves of
(40:47) feminism why can't you give me a Are there three waves of feminism there's four okay so there's three oh you didn't
(40:54) know that that's crazy so there are three correct there's four right but that would mean there's also three even
(40:59) though there's a fourth right that's true three is less than four i know that but the fact that there's four there's
(41:05) still three that have happened right irrelevant to anything modern feminism wait is that an appeal to authority
(41:13) what authority am I citing right now i don't You're citing facts that you think are appeal to authority what authority have I cited name one name one authority
(41:20) I've cited jay think one authority I've cited you don't understand name one authority I've cited i'm making a joke
(41:26) because you think appealing to a fact is appeal to authority those are two different things not true in fact when
(41:31) you were citing when you're citing Rockefeller as the definition for feminist feminism the fun is not the
(41:39) definition you idiots then why are you appealing to them in any way to prove the history of the
(41:44) movement is I just gave you the example I gave I've been debating for 25 years i
(41:50) know what the appeal to authority is that's one right there okay so that's the appeal to authority you appeal to irrelevant people that sound authority
(41:56) not relevant the history of feminism isn't relevant to you giving me a definition of feminism that I can
(42:03) operate on is it a historical movement can you give me Is it a historical movement yeah of course then the history is relevant to the definition you idiot
(42:09) then give me the definition you can do it nice if we can do it Jay I believe in you it's like talking to a 5-year-old
(42:15) yeah well you're a big boy so this should be really easy for you define feminism go ahead feminism is a
(42:21) historical movement that's concerned with the rights of women including
(42:26) egalitarianism the idea that women and men are equal if we go back to Wallstone Craft if we go back to the suffrage
() 
(42:33) movement if we go back to the notion of women not being married at certain ages as children so the first wave wanted
(42:39) suff not just suffragism but they also wanted to not have child brides and that
(42:45) kind of stuff i'm really proud of you you guys listen I'm not Shut up shut up and let me finish i'm not done i'm not
(42:52) done they also wanted uh better work hours they wanted women
(42:57) to have inheritance rights they wanted women to be able to get jobs and and and
(43:03) they went to women in the workforce and to be in positions that they didn't have so they wanted certain social rights
(43:09) that women like voting right suffered right those are all first wave okay this
(43:16) is your definition of feminism okay i've wr I'm writing it down are you serious i look I I'm so dumb you asked for the
(43:22) history of it i didn't ask you for the history i asked you for history you said that it's historical and I've given you
(43:27) the movement i'm not asking for the history i'm asking You said it is historical so I have to go back to the
(43:33) people you're so dumb that you can't conceive of a position apart from the people who came up with the position
(43:40) i'll do so Israel i can define Israel without going through the entire history of Israel feminism while it doesn't
(43:47) Actually you can silly conversation you admitted it's a historical movement
(43:53) therefore it can't be divorced from the people in history do you think it came out of the sky did it come into people's
(43:59) minds out of the sky or from the people you're doing a false dichotomy again what are you dude you don't even You're
(44:06) acting like you can't define it without the history i'm telling you correct it's a historical movement by your own definition that doesn't mean that you
(44:11) can't make a definition for the word you have to go to the people that where do you think words come from from people
(44:18) they don't drop out of the sky they come from people jay I know you can do this you can define a word without giving me
(44:23) a fiveinut monologue on the history no you can't so there's no way for you to define feminism would you go to a
(44:29) dictionary that's an appeal to authority it's not an appeal to authority okay there are appeal to authorities that are
(44:35) facious and there appeal to authorities that are nonious like when I give the examples of the funders of it is not an
(44:42) is not just a fun abby was involved in cell 16 she's not just a funer that doesn't matter that doesn't It does
(44:48) because it came from them that doesn't mean that she's a relevant uh authority to site the one who funded it and got it
(44:55) going at Chicago University is not relevant portions of the third wave yes that doesn't mean that she comes out of
(45:00) her money millions of dollars at Chicago University that doesn't mean that she's the definer of feminism i didn't say she
(45:06) was i said she's You cited her as a definer of feminism she's involved in the third wave definition of feminism j
(45:12) oh my gosh you're so stupid i've got three things from you so far even do a feminism equals rights of women men and
(45:19) women are admitted labor rights three things what else is feminism we can do this in terms of first wave feminism I
(45:27) mentioned child age of marriage as another element of it in terms of the first wave let's civil rights let's just
(45:34) call those civil rights that's not civil rights it's Oh my gosh it's prior to the civil rights movement you idiot that
(45:39) doesn't mean that it's not civil rights Jay i'm just trying to create a way to make this succinct so we can get a [ __ ] definition because you don't
(45:45) like mine which is fine that's why I'm just trying to get a new one that's fine
(45:51) make your own i'm giving the historic I don't need my own definition it's your
(45:57) position you goofus you you debate positions like when you debated Jim Bob and you tell people to define your
() 
(46:03) position this is how silly you are no J you gave a broad definition i gave you a definition and you too broad that's fine
(46:10) make your own definition and then we can work from there to make a definition if you have rejected my
(46:16) definition you now have to supply one yes I'm going to the people who came up with it correct his Rockefeller didn't
(46:23) come up with it i said Mary Walstonecraft in my opening statement is one of the first feminists in modern society
(46:30) do you want to supply a definition this doesn't matter Jay just make definition so the people who came up
(46:35) with it don't matter they matter if you can get to getting a definition out of your [ __ ] mouth we've got we've got
(46:42) four elements of feminism now okay so we've got rights of women like men and women are equal
(46:48) egalitarianism labor rights and civil rights is there anything else you would like to add to that definition as we
(46:54) move into modernity we get more radical versions of this particularly with Cell
(46:59) 16 which becomes almost a revolutionary terrorist movement which it wants to engage in radical action and Skittles
(47:08) rights shall we say so they move into it being Skittles as well okay so now I don't care if you reject trans rights i
(47:14) don't care if you reject that or accept that i because I'm looking at this as a historical movement because guess what
(47:21) feminism is a historical movement that's what we're debating you might not believe me Jay it's so I'm so I'm so
(47:26) disappointed about this conversation i talked about chatter because I was interested in a good disc you keep
(47:32) saying chatter doesn't have anything to do with the fact that I did an internal critique and you didn't know what that was and then I start going to the
(47:38) history of feminism and then you're right now you're just saying I'm just saying stuff yeah there we go so going
(47:43) to chatter the reason I asked you about it is so that we could have a decently good conversation so that we weren't quibbling over the definition of words
(47:50) and we could actually engage in conversation if if the only way that you can debate for the last 25 years is to
(47:56) just quibble about semantics of words I'm sorry you're not a king debater
(48:01) you're just bad faith you asked me for the last 30 minutes to define a word so you're the one that's quibbling about
(48:07) semantics that's semantics i'm literally not quibbling i am writing down your word oh so if you're writing it down I'm
(48:13) granting It's not semantics because I'm just granting your definition it was semantics no it's not it's not semantic
(48:19) debating because I'm not disagreeing with you on your definition i'm literally begging you to just give me
(48:24) one i'm begging you at this point because you don't like mine so let's give yours i don't care what your
(48:31) definition is because all I have to do is critique your position internally and and points out that it's about my
(48:38) definition if you're going to do an internal critique that's the fundamental of a [ __ ] internal critique is that
(48:43) Oh now you do know about so you just learned about an internal critique about 10 minutes ago and now you're going to lecture me on it you're a really good
(48:49) teacher Jay what can I say so debate's over you do care about admitted she's learning you do care about feminism and
(48:56) my definition of it because you need it for the internal critique which you've already done i don't care about it because now you've rejected my
(49:01) definition of feminis i know being mean to women is your fall back you have nothing homin
(49:08) now so there we go it's not an ad hominant i didn't say you're being mean to you i didn't say you're wrong because
(49:13) you're being an [ __ ] i just said you're an [ __ ] now you're getting your feelings that's not an ad homonym my feelings are It's not an ad homm no
(49:20) insulting people and being mean is an ad hom you should know this you can Google it google it at home an ad hom is when
(49:25) you use the insult of a person to discredit them so if I said "Jay you're wrong because you're mean." Now I'm ad
(49:31) homing you as a debate bro of 25 years you should know your fallacies better
(49:36) you've already been wrong about multiple fallacies really and you can't def Yes and you can't define feminism do you
(49:42) want to get there i've you've already admitted that I gave you four elements of the first five actually i think that
(49:49) you actually think that you actually think like a 100 IQ person that the way
(49:55) that you define something is you literally just look at a definition in a dictionary and then you just list it out
() 
(50:00) and that's the definition of the word that's false really that's Yeah i've never seen because I'm giving you the
(50:06) entire context of the history of feminism and you're saying I need a [ __ ] definition as we're working
(50:13) through the actual history of it and the definition of what it is to give me you admitted that it's a historical movement
(50:18) didn't that has nothing to do with you giving me a definition that it's a historical
(50:25) movement so the history has to do with it you idiot I don't need the history for you to give me a definition you
(50:30) idiot we have to go to the people who are the philosophers of it you can just define like Mary Wallstonecraft and her
(50:37) positions like egalitarianism you can just define it i'm defining it for you
(50:42) i've been defining it and you just keep yapping and melting down over your notes well the issue is that it has taken me
(50:48) pushing you to be specific over and over for 45 minutes we have five points now because you don't have anything other
(50:54) than this that's false i prove your position that feminism is good for society as a feminist you're
(51:01) showing us that you're not good for society so you're actually proving my point as you yap and argue you're
(51:06) proving my point great example of an ad hom that is actually that is an adom that is an but it's but it's an illustrative ad homonym yes correct
(51:13) that's true it was a very creative ad hom okay so we have five points that you would like to define feminism is there any other points that you want to define
(51:20) feminism with yes people who funded that also said that they like the movement because it destroys the nuclear family
(51:27) gets women in the workforce taxes the other half of the population and reduces
(51:33) the population because there's less families uh how do you want to summarize that
(51:39) destruction of nuclear I just said feminism you can't remember four sentences I just said no I can remember i just want to like you're such a you're
(51:46) just very yappy and so I'd like to make it succinct yes you to give me a definition you've had to give me an
(51:52) entire century's worth of history even though like when you admitted that it's a historical movement so it can't be it
(51:57) can't be divorced from the historical you know what you could have done you could have just said to me so that we can move forward with this conversation feminism is but I'm not going to grant
(52:04) women men and women and simple answers in a debate why
(52:09) wouldn't you just define a word maybe we could avoid some of the the
(52:15) insults and if we can also allow people to to finish their thought let's try to
(52:22) uh Okay are you not do interruptions but go ahead go ahead i want to know how this any of this helps your case to
(52:28) prove feminism is good for society well we can get there now that we've defined feminism so destruction of nuclear
(52:33) family is another one that you would like to add to definition of feminism that's why the people who fund it matter
(52:39) is because they say that okay i would argue that the destruction of nuclear families is not inherent to most
(52:45) feminist movements and is bad so I reject that part of your definition so the people who want that in society and
(52:51) say that it does that don't matter uh because you have a they're not the feminism that I'm fighting for because you have a definition that is so elastic
(52:58) to make it anything that you think helps women and that's why I've said you've already lost the debate because you're
(53:03) elastic the well you define promotion of femininity so
(53:09) empowerment means things like removing obstacles ambiguous and promotion of femininity would be like making feminine traits viewed as respectworthy like
(53:16) submitting to authority in men is that a feminine trait uh no I would not say so oh so so it's not clear it's ambiguous
(53:23) submission is you have to define it i would say submission is feminine but I don't I don't think it's to men
(53:28) specifically no okay it would be like to any authority right to any authority are most authority men a lot of them are but
(53:35) some so it would be to men nope it would be too authority well men aren't a class men aren't a
(53:41) class but most authorities are men and they are submitting to that right that So so it would be yeah but the idea Okay
(53:49) you love semantic no it's called a debate i can do that too if you want me to just like mock you every time you stutter we can have a
(53:55) super fun it's just how debates work i'm sorry when they stutter is not rhetoric is part of debate is it this is not
(54:01) rhetoric this is just you being watched an Oxford Union debate they make fun of each other i'm fine with you making fun of each
(54:07) other i That's what I've been doing okay would you like to have a productive conversation too or do you want to just
(54:12) do We can circle the drain i'm having a great time that's fine we can just continue to circle the And how does uh
(54:18) this prove feminism is good for society okay so I already said I would reject the destruction of nuclear family i
(54:23) don't think it's central to most feminism i think most uh was it central to C16 uh it sounds like it was but I
(54:30) would say most fourthwave feminists for example are not very pro- destruction of the nuclear family in fact there's like an entire like barefoot pregnant
(54:36) movement within the fourth wave that is very much about embracing uh being pregnant being motherhood and like promoting that as a good thing is that
(54:42) the attitude that most feminists in society have i would say a lot of young feminists are directing are they the
(54:48) most i wouldn't no they're not most also don't want to destroy the nuclear family
() 
(54:54) well in academia and feminists want to get married and have kids does this worldview promote in general in society
(55:01) in academia and in the corporate world the destruction of the family or does it
(55:06) help that uh it it tends to promote it yeah they want women to be mothers who
(55:11) can also feminism promotes women in society in general i would say fourth wave feminism is very pro mother yeah i
(55:18) asked you about the majority of feminism today that's institutionalized
(55:23) yeah most institutional academics are fourth and they and they want people to have kids yes they're not antiatalists
(55:29) uh some of them are but most of them are not institutions yes no that's crazy i I don't know what to tell you i've been
(55:35) reading lots of Well I've been in academia i've been in institutions i've never met a feminist in academia institutions who thinks that there
(55:41) should be more people and more kids they all believe in depopulation the ones that I've met that's crazy i've just met
(55:46) lots of feminists that don't believe that and regardless those feminists who who are like basically death cult feminists I'm not interested in
(55:52) advocating for the worldview that's fine i don't have to own them but the history of feminism just like you don't have to own like Protestant most feminism right
(55:58) so you've got a nuanced feminism I guess is your take right uh I just have like a pretty traditional like fourth wave
(56:04) feminism okay so but it's not historic feminism right or is it first wave it's
(56:09) fourth wave so it's tied to history of course because there's waves oh so it is tied to history yeah but the waves the
(56:15) essentials of the waves is that I've never ever said that feminism isn't tied to history you've just made that up uh I
(56:22) think we could go back about 20 minutes so you can do what I do you know we go back 20 minutes where you said that the history doesn't matter and you need
(56:29) definition it doesn't matter you can hold literally you have double think going on have you read 1984 you can hold
(56:36) your read right do you know what double think is it's the ability to contradict within a couple minutes i didn't go if
() 
(56:42) you remember we can roll back the tape we were talking about defining You think definitions are relevant can I finish my
(56:47) thought or are you just going to interrupt me because I'm trying to Can I finish i'm trying to hone in on what this weird mistake is because it's weird
(56:55) guys if we can at least we'll let the insults go if you guys want to insult each other we'll allow that but at least
(57:00) let each other finish their thoughts go ahead okay the reason that we went into the history and why I said I don't care
(57:07) about the history is I was asking for a functional definition so we could move past that part of the conversation i
(57:13) always acknowledge that history was part of the feminist movement and it's tied to I reject that there is a definition
(57:18) divorce from history i've never said that there's a definition divorce from history i said I don't need because you
(57:24) said I don't need the history lesson i don't as you got to let me finish you
(57:30) asked me cuz you're lying you asked me for that divorce you said divorced from history what is your definition that's
(57:35) what you said yeah I didn't want the history thank you so you just contradicted yourself no I didn't contradict myself you're a machine of
(57:41) contradiction desperate you're so desperate you're like God how do I get this win i asked for you to stop giving
(57:48) me all of the history and just gave me a definition so we can [ __ ] that there is a definition divorce from history and
(57:54) you just admitted that you can't so you don't have the brain capacity to define something without a fiveminute monologue
(57:59) about the history you just admitted you can't do that define Israel are you going to go back 3,000 years to define
(58:05) correct yes because it's a ancient historical nation yes so you can't define Israel without giving me a
(58:10) 10-minute monologue it's a false analogy because feminism is a modernist movement it's a modern movement it's not an
(58:16) ancient civilization it doesn't matter it does matter you're just saying it doesn't matter just shows your time is
(58:21) not all a false analogy extensive you are melting down right now because you contradicted yourself i'm melting down
(58:28) because you said that you had 25 years of debate history and you can't you can't get a single thousand look at you
(58:33) you're melting down how is that a false analogy how is that a false analogy Jay because it's a modern movement it's not
(58:39) an ancient civilization what does that have to do with anything when it comes to comparing contradicted and in debates
(58:46) contradictions are what has nothing to do with the false analogy how is that a false that's how you lose the debate correct contradicting is where you lose
(58:52) the debate define Israel without giving me the centuries of history is that what you're telling me i didn't say that you just said that you said it was a false
(58:58) analogy so what was the false analogy i never said that you said that so you're trying You're You're yapping because you
(59:05) got caught i didn't get caught you did again you did you said that history You
(59:10) said history doesn't matter give me your definition and then you just said history matters it's part of the
(59:16) definition you contradicted i did not say history matters as part of No you did yes you did part of debating part of
(59:22) debating is holding frame right would you agree
(59:29) like when you did that is that holding frame or what is that no that was making fun of you obviously right right so part
(59:34) of debating is holding frame like putting dongs in your mouth is that holding frame i don't understand no
(59:40) that's funny like yeah we're all laughing about it yes or are we laughing at you um kind of the same thing that's
(59:45) kind of what performers do right yeah so part of debating is holding frame is any
(59:50) of this going to prove that feminism is good for society because literally you can't get there because you are you make
(59:57) my case i'm not making your case again just an ad hom you love fallacies it's
(1:00:03) my favorite thing about you is that you cite fallacies constantly you don't know what they mean and you can't define them
(1:00:08) properly like how history is not part of feminism but how is it a false analogy to compare Israel defining
() 
(1:00:15) Israel because it's an ancient nation state feminism is a modern political
(1:00:21) social revolutionary movement they don't compare so why does the extent of the length of this make them disalious
(1:00:28) you've already lost the debate because you admitted that the definition can't be divorced from the history and then
(1:00:34) you said the opposite that means you've massively contradicted yourself within the last 5 minutes again you're just
(1:00:40) making [ __ ] up i'm glad that the madeup narrative I mean everybody heard you oh all is Jay just lost the debate because
(1:00:47) you straw manning me and putting words in my mouth that didn't happen wow i'm really good at debating do you want to
(1:00:52) go back to the actual conversation sure okay so why is it falsely analogous when
(1:00:58) you're saying that to define words you must include the entire history to define the word why is it disanalogous
(1:01:04) to compare feminism to Israel i asked you to define feminism and I asked you to define Israel and I asked you if you
(1:01:10) could define Israel without the three centuries of history and you said well it's different it's a false analogy a
(1:01:16) false analogy why is it a false analogy because they're two totally different things and you already admitted that
(1:01:24) feminism is a historical movement and that it can and can't be divorced from the history so is Israel
(1:01:30) that's making my point you goofus no it's not it is i'm saying you can obviously define Israel without going
(1:01:37) through three centuries which you agreed to that's why you don't that's a false analogy because you won't define Israel
(1:01:43) with the three centuries because it's just it's just long it's an ancient nation state modern feminism only has a
(1:01:49) hundred years so I can give the history of that but I can't give the history of Israel to define it because it's too long essentially that's your argument
(1:01:55) that's what Yes that is your argument it is not falsely analogous and also comparing two different things is the
(1:02:01) point of [ __ ] the more that you talk it makes my whole case here that feminism is a net negative for society
(1:02:07) thank you for representing feminism by the way all you're doing is making me be like maybe the rads are right and men got to be out of power cuz they cannot
(1:02:13) keep up if this is what like two masters philosophy right you literally contradicted yourself with I think the
(1:02:19) conservatives are right don't go to college guys you're going to end up like this not good i don't recommend people
(1:02:24) go to college by the way because you are the people that teach at college so you're actually you're like the college
(1:02:30) professors I debated the women I debated you're like them so they should go to college if you want them to be in your
(1:02:36) position right no I if they end up anything like you they should definitely not go to college you're like I had a philosophy
(1:02:43) degree and I don't know what fallacies are did I say that basically was that was
(1:02:48) that a cut down good one try again this would be a perfect moment to
(1:02:54) read a couple chats here we have Cat who gifted 50 memberships thank you so much Cat guys W's in the chat for Cat thank
() 
(1:03:01) you for the gifted 50 whatever memberships robert Tanner thank you for the gifted 50 whatever memberships thank
(1:03:06) you so much we also have Rachel Wilson in the building thank you for the gifted five memberships really appreciate it
(1:03:12) and then we have a couple chats coming in here through Streamlabs let me get those pulled up if you guys want to get
(1:03:19) a message in it's uh $99 and up we have Intel Wild oh it's coming in as a TTS l
(1:03:25) Wild donated $100 not so bright do you like BDSM
(1:03:30) because you are getting spanked by Jay ah classic when you can't defeat a woman
(1:03:36) you just have to sexually like when you do the dongs in your mouth like that is that a good example what you're talking about i can't defeat a woman so you put
(1:03:42) dongs in your mouth because it's funny you can't defeat a woman without sexually degrading her and then making a joke like when you put dongs in your
(1:03:48) mouth is that sexually degrading by yourself that was Oh by yourself okay right so it's all subjective like relativism usually you can make jokes
(1:03:54) about yourself that you believe in relativism too yeah I do really is it self-refuting no is relativism true uh
(1:04:03) but depends on what you mean by true is any is everything relative uh every Yes but that doesn't mean it's like
(1:04:09) subjective it means the same thing yeah no it does not yes it does no something being totally relative means that it is
(1:04:15) subjective no that's I'm sorry that is like a philosophy 101 that's it's
(1:04:21) correct philosophy 101 you would learn that if something is completely relative then it's purely subjective it's the
(1:04:26) same no yes it is it's you're conflating subjectivism to cultural relativism at
(1:04:32) best i know the difference between the opposite of relativism your position is what do you think the opposite of relativism is you've already now that
(1:04:37) you've admitted that everything is relative to you what do you think it is the opposite of relativism there's
(1:04:42) epistemic relativism there's cultural relativism there's ethical relativism what's broadly the opposite of relativism everything is relative to
(1:04:48) your vantage point your perspective perspectivalism no it's not you're an idiot it's absolutism it's not
(1:04:54) objectivism relativism is not absolutism no the opposite of relativism is moralism it's objectivism no it's not no
(1:05:01) the idiot you You've never had Have you I don't know that's crazy i've debated
(1:05:07) all the top atheists and philosophers and you I'm not going to lie i didn't expect that i You should definitely The
(1:05:12) opposite of relativism is objectivism it's absolutism it this it means the
(1:05:17) same thing yes it does no it does not you you have a problem with words that you think that two different words can't
(1:05:23) mean the same thing okay moral absolutism is when you can apply things universally objectivism is that
(1:05:30) something can be like capital T true these are the same thing you can use the termin you're arguing over these are not
(1:05:36) the same yes they are no they're not moral objectivism what is that moral objectivism is believing that there's
(1:05:41) like a capital T true you can find yeah that's not the same thing as No no it's not k is moral objectivism you don't
(1:05:47) know what you're talking about moral objectivism is that there are moral absolutes it's that simple
(1:05:55) no yes what do you mean no that's crazy uh can I get water so now she wants to
(1:06:01) run and get water no I'm not running i'm actually just I'm smacked oh there's some under
(1:06:06) under because you have a basically you have essentially an ele you have an elementary school level education and
(1:06:12) you're actually debating people who actually know what philosophy It's crazy because despite my little education you
(1:06:17) still don't know what relativism is versus like absolutism and objectivism that's fine we can move on i've debated
(1:06:23) the dude from the objectivist foundation the Enran Foundation so I'm pretty sure I know
(1:06:29) again then you would know the position do you understand that a word can mean different things in different context so
(1:06:35) if I say that something is morally objective or that it's morally absolute or that it's not relative or subjective
(1:06:42) it all means the same thing even though it's different words did you know that
(1:06:49) that's crazy okay that's crazy that words can mean the same thing is crazy that you don't have any concept of the
(1:06:54) philosophical compass is crazy the philosophical compass yes so memes meme
(1:07:00) level philosophy yeah it's not meme level it's a meme it's it's not team level philosophy because you thought
(1:07:06) that words didn't mean the same thing okay we have a chat coming in here from
(1:07:14) Robert one sec guys let's get that pulled up there it is thank you Robert appreciate it robert donated
(1:07:21) $200 hey Brian comment on this discussion bloomberg just reported two
(1:07:26) days ago that for the first time ever white men are slightly now less than half of board members at S&P 500
(1:07:33) companies progress on GDP thank you Robert do you guys want to discuss that
(1:07:39) or uh not I don't know if that's even true if that's true uh I feel neutally
(1:07:47) about it okay it depends on like why it's the case right i think like white men in general are being like pretty
(1:07:52) shittily treated by society right now i think there's like a fair bit of like persecution so I suspect that the
(1:07:57) reasons behind that is bad but maybe it's neutral but probably it's bad but maybe it's neutral all right we have
(1:08:03) three other chats unless Jay you wanted to weigh in on that one no I agree that's bad sure we have whatever fan
(1:08:09) thank you whatever fan donated $100 i'm enjoying Jay Barbecue cooking
(1:08:15) her puppy cheeks better than Gordon Ramsay like a donkey okay they like my
(1:08:20) cheeks that's all I heard we have You got cooked is what they said i know i
(1:08:25) know you can't I know you can't hear something there was a nice one that came through about you uh I saw All right we
(1:08:32) have Grandma sweaters coming in here in just a moment grandma's Grandma's
(1:08:38) sweaters excuse me grandma's sweaters donated $100 eerodite that makes no sense
(1:08:45) feminism is a populist movement where each rep in history interprets the definition feminism hold ancient beliefs
(1:08:53) and utilize history as foundation for their beliefs yep okay
(1:08:59) just it's not a reputation of anything that I've said if you guys understand that you can't understand objective
(1:09:04) argument with me I'm right here but if you want to keep fighting like some But you're arguing in yourself in your head
(1:09:10) it's like a hamster wheel running and you're not actually in the debate i've definitely times I did a lot of labor
(1:09:18) finally i bet you couldn't restate my internal critique could you of me yeah uh it was something about how you think
(1:09:24) that I'm like self-defeating uh because you think that my definitions uh necessarily like contradict each other
(1:09:30) which they don't it was just a false dichconomy now that wasn't the internal critique but good try okay do you want
(1:09:35) to remind me you got more yeah we have Rachel Wilson thank you Rachel
(1:09:40) appreciate it donated $100 the most merciful thing that the large family does to one of its infant
(1:09:47) members is kill it margaret Sanger founder of Planned Parenthood firstwave feminist feminism is intrinsically
(1:09:55) anti-natalist yep i just disagree okay good job thank you Rachel Wilson appreciate that and it's almost like
(1:10:01) there's lots of camps to a large movement like so it's elastic exactly thank you yep to some degree yeah we
(1:10:07) would agree that there's heterogeneity within any movement right so it can be defined the way you need it at whatever
(1:10:13) point in the debate i defined it really clearly like broadly so that you could move it later and it didn't work agree
(1:10:20) i'm sorry it didn't work why did you agree to it because I was setting you up to lose later that's why oh it was an AD chess plan correct and then it took you
(1:10:27) 45 minutes to define it later no I just let you sink your own dig your own hole after 45 minutes whatever you need to
(1:10:32) tell yourself hey I bet you 95% of the chat's going to agree with me you want to sure that this chat because
(1:10:38) everybody's dumb oh really so everybody in the chat's dumb thank you oh I didn't say that i said "I'm sure chatters agree
(1:10:43) with you i just don't." But you think that my arguments are dumb so they're dumb i'm not super interested in what
(1:10:48) chatters have to say viewers are a very different breed optics and who won the debate is judged by the audience uh yeah
() 
(1:10:55) but the audience isn't just chatters right it's also viewers and these are not the same person i I bet the comments
(1:11:00) are going to say otherwise i'm sure the comments on a very rightle leaning decently Eastern Orthodox that has
(1:11:06) already accepted most of your presuppositions as a show are going to agree with you right leaning right leaning yeah I'm I'm sure that they're
(1:11:13) going to agree with you but that doesn't mean that you've won right just like if you if I put this on my channel and then
(1:11:18) all of my left-leaning audiences said I won that's not evidence that I won obviously are you sure yeah obviously
(1:11:24) that would be like a super selection debates debates are for audiences sure did you listen to anything I just said
(1:11:30) what's a selection bias well it's when you choose the evidence based on what you want that's not a selection bias
(1:11:36) that's called uh Well you're talking about you're talking about audiences and like my audience would like my stuff so if they like me then I think I won
(1:11:43) because my audience liked me so I selectively chose the audience is what you're saying no okay a se No so you
(1:11:49) know what never mind you're wrong no that's what it is it's crazy i don't know what any of these words mean you've
(1:11:54) really impressed people selection i like how the word objective just means absolutely selection bias in science means that like a naturally arising
(1:12:01) population that you are testing might end up having some emergent trait that you think is a construct true of that
(1:12:07) group when actually you've already set up the prerequisite methodology to find that trait within it so my audience is
(1:12:13) going to like my [ __ ] more and your audience will like your [ __ ] literally what I just said yeah but the issue is
(1:12:18) that that's what I just said you were defining that's what I just said no you said that you and that's what I just defined you idiot no you're stupid like
(1:12:25) I literally just defined the same thing that you said do you think that when you call me stupid you win like what's the purpose you're factually demonstrating
(1:12:32) what is the case again do you think that you're winning you literally give the same definition I did i don't care no
(1:12:37) the issue was that you were doing the um what's it called when you Oh I thought you knew the fallacies i thought you knew the fallacies i I do i just don't
(1:12:44) remember but you don't you don't cuz you didn't know what an internal critique was either do you remember what the word
(1:12:49) is for when you uh selectively pick your you cherry pick your evidence what's the word for Well there's two fallacies
(1:12:55) there's the sharpshooter fallacy and the gambler's fallacy so you might be referring to either of those no just cherrypicking fallacy it's not
(1:13:02) cherry-picking fallacy it's got He doesn't even know the fallies i I do no you don't yes so what's what's the
(1:13:07) gambler's fallacy if you know the fallacy what's a false analys what's the What's the gambler's fallacy i I don't know you just said you knew the
() 
(1:13:13) fallacies i know lots of fallacies that doesn't mean I know every What's one of the most popular ones you don't know nope in incomplete evidence
(1:13:20) policy of incomplete evidence suppressing evidence uh I
(1:13:25) Okay I can't think of the word it starts with a C sure we have a few more excuse me a few more chats coming through
(1:13:32) thank you Christopher appreciate it christopher Scott donated $100 thank you absolutism is a form of objectivism they
(1:13:40) are intrinsically intertwined not so bright oh you thought words only had one meaning donor said it so you thought
(1:13:45) words only had one meaning i'm sorry sometimes they can mean two different things it's called a word concept fallacy did you know about that one or
(1:13:51) no i should I should write that one down when later you get mad at me for using the word Texas sharpshooter go look it
(1:13:57) up work concept fallacy look that up can gamblers fallacy go look that up and
(1:14:02) internal critique thank you by the way guys we did set a super chat goal uh
(1:14:08) we're at 13 of 50 we have about 50 minutes left on it uh Kyla will wear a
(1:14:16) hat if you give me part of that I will give you a $2 bill if I'm the reward for it I'm getting some of that money but
(1:14:23) I'll definitely wear the hat we'll talk after the show we'll we got to see if we hit the goal but we can hit the goal guys 50 minutes uh let's see here we're
(1:14:31) all caught up caught up we should give $100 to whichever chatter can figure out why Jay doesn't understand what a false
(1:14:37) analogy is and was incorrect in the use of it i know what a false analogy is that's true but then why do you use it
(1:14:42) incorrectly i didn't you did so either comparing the nation state of Israel comparing the nation state of Israel to
(1:14:49) the history of feminism is a false analogy what was I comparing you asked for a definition that was not
(1:14:56) connected to history and then by the way you said that history is bound up with a definition so I asked you Israel if you
(1:15:02) could define it without going through the history and you said yeah I could no I didn't you said that you could define
(1:15:08) Israel with No I didn't i said I have to and the reason why you said that it's disanalogous is you said Israel has too
(1:15:13) long of history you just yapped and didn't listen that I said you can't I said you can't define Israel without
(1:15:20) going into the ancient history you said that I don't want to and that it's disanalogous because Israel has long
(1:15:25) history and feminism has short history that would contradict what you just said what you said that's what you That would contradict what you just said like 2
(1:15:31) minutes ago that doesn't matter i was catching it doesn't matter it doesn't matter so contradictions don't matter in a debate your contradictions matter yes
(1:15:40) oh my gosh you just admitted that you contradicted and now you're saying that I'm No I did not you did no you said
(1:15:46) they don't matter no I said that when you were trying when I asked you to define Israel I asked if you could
(1:15:51) define Israel without going through these centuries of history and you said that you could you said that you could lying i
(1:15:58) said I didn't the reason why it was a false analogy look at you you're losing your mind you're crazy you can't hold
() 
(1:16:04) your crane like this is crazy i said you can't because in the same case as feminism you can't i you know what if
(1:16:11) you want to retroactively change your claim and correct it fair enough
(1:16:16) i think maybe you misheard no because it wouldn't work for my argument if I said the opposite that's why it was stupid of
(1:16:22) you to say i didn't say that i said that neither feminism nor Israel could be defined apart from their history
(1:16:29) you said that and you're lying right now no I'm not you said you are lying you said that you wouldn't go through the
(1:16:34) reason why these were disalities the reason why these were disalities is you couldn't go through the centuries of history for Israel because of the extent
(1:16:41) and this is why I laughed at you when I said they're disal one has long history and one has short history misheard
(1:16:46) because you don't listen maybe you misspoke you can't understand i can grant you that you misspoke maybe you misspoke you obviously did i didn't
(1:16:53) misspeak you obviously did but it's it's disanalogous because the two things are different separate from that I said that
(1:17:00) I can't define Israel apart from history analogous you don't even understand what I'm
(1:17:05) saying you can compare two different things that I'm comparing is defining things without their history and you
(1:17:10) said that I could define Israel without this entry i said that's fair that you misspoke it's No I didn't misspeak you
(1:17:16) just don't don't listen okay we got a chat coming through here we got Ali Bur Knight thank you for that appreciate it
(1:17:22) ali the Knight donated $100 thank you for that thank you thank you knight please remove and rotate from your
(1:17:28) Twitter banner you're not worthy occult feminism will help with the after co my
(1:17:34) favorite thing is dumb asses who think that I have up there because I like Andrew Tate it's clearly a meme it's obviously a meme
(1:17:41) uh earlier on in the discussion you said that feminism is unavoidable i think
(1:17:46) during your opening introduction unavoidable and necessary yeah um do you want to get into that a little bit like
(1:17:51) why I guess why is it unavoidable uh I think because as uh nations grow
(1:17:57) essentially eventually you will want women to join the workforce to be able to compete at like a global scale and
(1:18:03) therefore it becomes inevitable because you need women to join the workforce and as soon as women join the workforce they
(1:18:08) now have way more leveraging power by having money and certain rights and once they have those uh those rights and
(1:18:13) those leverage powers they're necessarily going to leverage that power to give themselves more freedom that they obviously wanted I don't what are
(1:18:20) you asking right now if it didn't exist for thousands of years in history then it wasn't necessary
(1:18:26) uh I'm pretty sure you've literally said that multiple countries fell because of like liberalization so I'm just asking
(1:18:31) you liberalization and giving women more rights did it exist for thousands of years until modernity um not all the
(1:18:38) forms of so then it's not necessary and it's not inevitable it's absolutely necessary at this point because if it did it for thousands of years then it's
(1:18:44) not necessary and inevitable you going to teach you something crazy you're not going to teach anything over time develop which means that the way
(1:18:50) that you're talking and asserting You got to let me talk the way that the Romans worked their world is not the way
(1:18:56) that we can work our world obviously because things then it's not inevitable and it's not necessary it is inevitable
(1:19:01) because was it necessary and inevitable in Rome wait just just let her finish let her finish go ahead okay this for example if you don't update to
(1:19:08) technology your society tends to fall behind so technologies that made her
(1:19:13) finish so technologies that make feminism necessary and unavoidable would be things like tampons and things like
(1:19:19) birth control this is absolutely true and they're never going back in the hole we're never we're never putting the the
(1:19:24) coldgate back in the in the [ __ ] tube right so Poland is a great example of a
(1:19:29) country that didn't update its technology and as a result it got stomped when the beginning of I believe
(1:19:34) World War I or World War II they invested in calvary because the Polish calvary was like the greatest thing the
(1:19:40) wing tards everyone loved them but tanks became a thing and they got absolutely utterly dumpstered and destroyed which
(1:19:46) is why for societies to compete at a global geopolitical level you have to keep up with technology the reality is that China wants to win over America
(1:19:53) which means they're going to allow women into the workforce they're going to give them tampons they're going to give them birth you have to none of that proves
(1:19:58) that it's necessary inevitable proves that it's a necessary and inevitable because the technology changes at a global level for you to compete at a
(1:20:05) global level you have to allow women to work so she just yaps this is like her whole thing is to just yap if it didn't
(1:20:10) happen in Rome then it wasn't necessary and inevitable and that proves my point do we live in Rome anymore oh my gosh
(1:20:15) are you serious you're that stupid do we live in Rome anymore or the technology you said necessary and inevitable yes
(1:20:20) was it necessary inevitable in Rome again the techn or do we live in Rome
(1:20:26) did we live in Rome so then it wasn't necessary inevitable are the technology Can you follow an argument that isn't just gapping and asserting your position
(1:20:32) jay can you follow me what's the argument it was not necessary in Rome because they didn't have tampons it wasn't necessary inevitable thank you it
(1:20:38) is inevitable because we now it's not necess you just said it's not necessary do tampons exist that refutes your position do tampons exist
() 
(1:20:46) no did they exist in Rome no they don't exist did they exist in Rome there are no tampons there's no such thing as tampons okay great
(1:20:54) if the tampons There's no such thing did they exist in Rome no so tampons are not real correct okay well if we're doing if
(1:21:01) we're doing this type of debate I guess that's true and the sky is purple and uh I'm a 12oot hippopotamus
(1:21:08) we have some chats coming through we have uh flower pot flowerpot 91 donated $100
(1:21:16) you two just need to bang already you are obviously secretly in love i'm married i think they're both They're
(1:21:22) both married uh thank you though for the message flowerp pot we have Lucas here he says "Dear God is this the exemplar
(1:21:29) of today's US education system this woman is an amalgam of feckless vapid initude combined with unearned high
(1:21:36) self-esteem." Do you want to respond to that uh Kyla or I'm Canadian huh i'm
(1:21:42) Canadian oh right even worse okay there you go all right all right actually Canada has like one of the most competitive education systems no it's
(1:21:47) worse because it produces Okay examples like this we have Intel Wild thank you Intel Wild appreciate Wild donated
(1:21:55) $100 not so bright you look like you have gained some weight lately moo moo
(1:22:00) oink co what the uh yeah i just finished my bulk cycle uh so I'm about 15 uh
(1:22:07) pounds heavier than I am and I'm about 120% more muscle than I want and I started cutting a few days ago that has
(1:22:13) nothing to do with it i'm answering why I'm fat right now are you building muscle bulk or fat bulk
(1:22:19) no no i I just said I gained 120% of the muscle that I'd ideally like to maintain after my Okay that's why I said is that
(1:22:25) part of your feminism regimen nope it's just part of putting on muscle which you
(1:22:30) would not know about i guess donated $100
(1:22:35) it's not too much to demand definition for the entire topic of the debate a good faith debate is contingent on being
(1:22:42) charitable to the other's intention gay sophistry to secure W is lame af that's
(1:22:48) true it is you got one fan it is pretty gay good job is this directly that's crazy you knew that was about you oh my
(1:22:54) god thank you that's so [ __ ] funny dude you're
(1:23:00) so cringe right now he's like I know that's me i'm doing the gay sophistry
(1:23:05) that is so funny well if any of you want to get a chat in it's $100 for a TTS you
(1:23:11) do that streamlabs.com if you put in enough money I'll wear a MAGA hat yeah
(1:23:17) let me see where we're at on that so we're at 17 of 50 so we need 33 more to
(1:23:23) hit the goal we got about 40 40 45 minutes you got to do uh 10 and over soup chats over there on YouTube uh or
(1:23:30) if somebody does a champagne pop we'll just do it right away so is that like a big donation yeah it's through
(1:23:36) Streamlabs they have to uh Yeah they do it through Streamlabs or if we have Crystalall here they have to do one
(1:23:41) Ethereum so uh that's another option if you Ethereum one Ethereum for a How much
(1:23:46) is that worth now it's like I think 17,800 around there holy [ __ ] it went
(1:23:53) down but it's a little back up so you're high class that's expensive i've got some crystal here if you guys want to
(1:23:58) get liquored up so okay uh I would like to continue on a little bit with the debate here do you guys want to shift
(1:24:04) the prompt to we could talk about patriarchy specifically we could talk pick a word and we'll fight about the
(1:24:10) definition for another form you guys want to talk about immigration or something i don't know no no okay not
(1:24:16) really well I didn't prep for immigration so I wouldn't want to talk about yeah um I'm just at least with a
(1:24:22) feminism related topic uh trying to think here any suggestions
(1:24:29) i mean we could talk about whether or not you think it's biological or not that men have an
(1:24:35) innate role to lead or not because when you debated Jim Bob you
(1:24:42) seem to think that soldiers are who puts on a costume
(1:24:48) what you said that a soldier is anyone that wears the costume of a soldier uh
(1:24:55) uh I'm pretty I'm pretty sure I was making fun of Jim Bob when I said that i don't think you were arguing that
() 
(1:25:00) there's no difference between a soldier who's a man and a soldier who's a woman because anybody who puts on the uniform
(1:25:05) becomes that i feel like you must be citing Ken i think Ken was somewhat equalizing the genders uh what are you
(1:25:13) asking about whether or not men should be the frontline soldiers you and Jim
(1:25:18) Bob particularly were going back and forth i'm fine with men being frontline sold why don't you just ask me a qu
(1:25:24) rather than putting words in my mouth just ask me what you want to ask me i did just ask you a question i said do you think that there's a gender or
(1:25:30) natural component that men have that makes them leaders and women not leaders
(1:25:36) in general um uh yeah to some degree um
(1:25:43) yes and then I think that gets reinforced culturally as well what does that mean what's the biological pieces
(1:25:50) no but what do you mean when it's reinforced culturally like what what is uh multiple things it would be
(1:25:56) multiffactorial so okay fancy word i know very I don't know big words go
(1:26:02) ahead you do i'm sure you know what mult I don't what is multiffactorial mean Jay make your argument okay sure so when I
(1:26:11) say multiffactorial in a cultural way I mean things like epigenetics right so I think when we have a culture that
(1:26:17) reinforces certain things and makes people more successful as a result of those expressions we'll also reinforce
(1:26:22) it through epigenetics it'll turn them on more often but also then it builds a cultural social identity of like what it
(1:26:28) means to be man and that's both testosterone and neurochemical but it's also slightly epigenetic right but it's
(1:26:35) also on top of that it's things like uh culture in society and what we do so there is a component that's biological
(1:26:41) that's genetic but there's also a component that you think is is cultural of course okay so if it's natural and
(1:26:47) biological why ought we put into place a position or a system that is counter to
(1:26:53) that that would make that position or system unnatural that's what I argued at the beginning trying to make that point
(1:26:59) again uh cuz it's not just biological right and I think but the fact that it's not just doesn't address the question
(1:27:05) that's being asked because by limiting people arbitrarily a partial fallacy by the way do you know that because by
(1:27:11) limiting people arbitrarily I think you decrease your damage it's not arbitrarily it is arbitrarily so for example you just admitted that there's a
(1:27:17) difference so it wouldn't be arbitrary it would be arbitrary so say for example well you don't don't do ecological
(1:27:23) fallacies on me right so if we have like a bell curve right of men and women and men tend to be a little bit more extreme
(1:27:28) and say we're selecting for a job that's purely So you're repeating the f the first 20 minutes of this discussion and and ignoring what I just asked you if
(1:27:35) you want me to respond to you I can if you want to just like bloate but you're not responding you're just you're just
(1:27:40) I'm trying to give you a response i'm trying to give you a response it's not a response i can just sit here and you can
(1:27:45) be like it's like a matter of fally fallacy or do you want me to respond
(1:27:52) you can try okay you sure
(1:27:58) you're the leader here try okay so at a individual level right i don't want a
(1:28:03) system that would limit any single individual from achieving higher levels than they can otherwise achieve
(1:28:09) what why are you mad it's just like talking to like a child it's just Okay what word are you mad about i know words
(1:28:15) are very sensitive for you what justifies the position that you're arguing for that patriarchy should not
(1:28:23) be the norm but feminism I've never said that oh my god i've just I've literally never said patriarch mutually exclusive
(1:28:29) position yes they are feminism is a revolutionary they live in a patriarchy and feminism exists that doesn't mean
(1:28:37) that they're not mutually exclusive that's a stupid argument no it's not that's an appeal to that's a naturalist fallacy the fact that it is so then it
(1:28:43) must be it must be good or it must be right i'm not saying that it's good or right i'm saying that they both exist the fact that they exist doesn't mean
(1:28:49) that the positions are coherent mutually exclusive they can be ideological or epistemically incoherent even if they
(1:28:55) exist at the same time you don't know that okay so how are they mutually exclusive Jay because they're contrary
(1:29:00) positions patriarchy is an anti-feminist position that's what I'm arguing i would
(1:29:05) not agree with that by and large do you think patriarchy just means that it wants to oppress and crush women you
(1:29:12) admitted that feminism is a historical movement all of its proponents are revolutionaries who wanted an
(1:29:18) egalitarian society and did not want a patriarchy they're mutually exclusive so
(1:29:24) you've redefined the position to be your own feminism that's not relevant to what we were debating i don't have to argue
(1:29:29) for those women i don't think that they're mutually exclusive but your position is stupid then because it's an ambiguous position that's just anything
(1:29:35) that you subjectively think helps women nope i just don't think that Nope yep hold on um I don't think that feminism
(1:29:43) is doing a good job by just dismantling patriarchy unless the patriarchy is enforced okay well we haven't heard why
(1:29:49) feminism is good other than GDP that's because you because you didn't give an argument you just said GDP
() 
(1:30:02) equival I will use literally any [ __ ] word because I know you really love words to try to debates have to do with
(1:30:08) words it's crazy why ought we have Why ought we have she can't tell us why we
(1:30:13) ought to have heaven she can't give an argument this is chatter this is what's the ought we can't I I don't even want
(1:30:19) to go there cuz you Because you don't have an argument no because you can't engage with me because you get so pnic
(1:30:25) what is the argument that feminism is right for society it is beneficial to
(1:30:31) society because it improves innovator scale it allows more GDP of course GDP is one of the things and why are we
(1:30:37) supposed to think that's the good because I think it is morally good to allow you think you think that why is that the good uh because I believe that
(1:30:44) it is good um Oh so it's you subjectively saying because it's the good no I'm a divine command theorist
(1:30:52) but when we went to God God didn't ever give us a feminist society yeah but I don't think by your own admission
(1:30:58) actually I think we by my definition of feminism we both agreed that ancient
(1:31:03) Judeo- like Christianity was feminist and then you're like it's moving the goalost never mind feminism is not that
(1:31:09) thing anymore it's moving the goalpost it's not moving the goalpost in any way shape or form i have had the experience
(1:31:15) you admitted that the society of the [ __ ] world admitted the society you just don't like it no you have an
(1:31:20) elastic broad definition that you allowed it as much as possible monarchy and a patriarchal society in ancient
(1:31:28) Israel that doesn't help feminism that's not your position there's no feminism because it gave women like rights to
(1:31:33) owning their feminism yes it is no it's not yes it is feminism is a modern
(1:31:39) revolutionary movement you idiot it's not an ancient movement this is unironically it's not an ancient civil
(1:31:44) rights because the Civil Rights Act didn't exist you're debating feminism which you said is a historical movement
(1:31:51) word can mean you said it's a historical movement i agreed but that I Yes it's a So it's not an ancient civilizational
(1:31:58) movement it's a construct it's a modern revolutionary social movement that doesn't matter that doesn't mean that we
(1:32:04) elements of it doesn't matter she just lost the debate again for the fourth time this guy just lost it four times in
(1:32:11) a row because he didn't even know that there are four waves of feminism and he just kept going "But there's three." But there's three yeah if there's four
(1:32:18) there's also three that's called That's a point that's a point I'm making in terms of stupid argument no it's not yes it is there's still three if there's
(1:32:24) four you know realize that there's there's also two and there's also one chat he didn't know it doesn't matter it
(1:32:30) doesn't matter how many i don't I don't care it doesn't matter that there's four waves but the history matters but it
(1:32:35) doesn't matter that there's four ways there was three so it doesn't matter that there was four you're not defending your position she doesn't even listen
(1:32:43) there's nothing to listen to like you're literally just like you're just You literally didn't know that you said that you're a relativist yes you just said
(1:32:51) that it's your definition and you're the source of your argumentation
(1:32:57) uh I'm sorry that means you lost the debate because you can't appeal to anything outside of yourself that's not
(1:33:02) true again if you want to do a grippa's dilemma you can you're just falling into dogmatism dogmatism stupid too no I do
(1:33:10) infinite regression i do internal critiques i do world view how do you solve infinite regression and dogmatism
(1:33:15) because I don't believe in your world how do you solveism how do you solve dilemma how do you do it because I'm not
(1:33:21) a foundationalist all are circular fundamentally all that's my position i
(1:33:26) know that's why I'm a holist how do you solve that by worldview apologetics so
(1:33:31) you none of these things matter it's all circular anyways no not everything is circular how do you solve your doctorals
(1:33:37) why are you yapping if you don't want to know the answer i'm just doing what you're doing i'm not going to lie i just
(1:33:42) I'm I'm I've put on the clothing of Jay okay i'm I'm performing now i don't have
(1:33:47) as good of hair though or sunglasses i don't have as good of hair to perform as Jay or sunglasses
(1:33:54) okay keep answering i'll keep doing it watch
(1:33:59) so there's a difference between something being circular at a normative level versus paradigm fundamental
(1:34:07) epistemic holism but that's Aren't a all circular though Jay didn't you just agree to that like 2 minutes ago see
(1:34:13) he's contradicting himself he doesn't even know what he's talking about this is crazy i just won the debate yep yep yep spursburg yeah i'm doing exactly
(1:34:20) what you do that's true all right we have a couple chats uh we have Dank
(1:34:26) Naked with the 50 uh thank you for the soup chat Cat thank you for the soup chat we have Lucas again yes dear what
(1:34:32) this chatter says parenthesis yours truly is indeed true i am on my firm's
(1:34:37) associate hiring committee i would describe you as a quote unquote mediocrity but in all cander even that
(1:34:44) would be gross hyperbole wow okay you response to Lucas or No um Lucas does
(1:34:51) your girlfriend know that you masturbate to bullying women online cuz I don't know if she'd like that she might be
(1:34:56) watching with him maybe they they both wrote this together uh thank you Lucas for the super chat i do appreciate it we
(1:35:03) have uh two chats coming in here through Streamlabs one moment we have the great
(1:35:09) One sec guys it is loading every day I'm struggling says
(1:35:15) asks this everyday I'm struggling donated $100 not so erodite what is the ontology
() 
(1:35:21) of logic from your world view are ethics universal do you want to respond to that uh I'm a
(1:35:28) divine command theorist i believe that God is fundamentally relative in how he approaches things and I do my best to use exesus is Jesus and divine
(1:35:34) revelation to understand what God's will is and to enact that in my life and understand pure gibberish so there's no
(1:35:40) such thing as as divine command theory that is relative yep we found one pure gibberish you just scoot your microphone
(1:35:47) to the edge of the table there perfect and then we have Intel Wild hold on let me read this before uh
(1:35:57) uh probably shouldn't read it if you're cringing that hard already it's it pertains to destiny and like my
(1:36:05) sexuality uh no is that relative or is that part
(1:36:11) of objective morals you know is it circular when you ask that question or is it part of like your absolute do you
(1:36:18) know what you're even talking about right what is your opinion on Destiny allegedly recording your good friend
(1:36:24) having sex without her consent and why i mean it's off topic Intel but if you want to uh Yeah if he did that it's bad
(1:36:33) okay all right thank you Intel Wild uh guys $100 TTS if you want to get a
(1:36:38) message in here if you're enjoying the stream you can also support via VMO Cash App they don't take any cut like how uh
(1:36:43) YouTube and Streamlabs and apparently also you guys do you stream on YouTube
(1:36:49) at all or so apparently I don't know if you know this so YouTube takes 30% cut
(1:36:54) you know that up to 45% if it's below $10 wait really here's the other thing though if they're
(1:36:59) using uh an iPhone or another Apple device and they use the YouTube app to send it in Apple takes 30% first so if
(1:37:09) somebody donates for example they send in a uh $200 super chat you're going to be left with $98 of the $200 super chat
(1:37:16) so they take a lot take a lot just uh you know for those of you who support Kyla or you support uh Jay here just
(1:37:23) consider sending it through either Streamlabs or some other method and then if you're enjoying the stream guys like
(1:37:29) the video also if you guys are watching on Twitch drop us a follow on the prime sub if you have one thank you guys uh shall we get back to the debate we have
(1:37:36) maybe about another 30 minutes or so so uh Jay can just pick a word um to define
() 
(1:37:42) and then prattle about it actually could you give me the history of a word uh you asked me for the definition so I don't
(1:37:47) know what you're talking about me prattling over the words when you asked for the definition i asked for definition you prattled for 30 minutes
(1:37:53) no I gave you definitions connected to the historical people you didn't help no you didn't do anything but talk yourself
(1:38:00) into oblivion i pulled it out of your We did it so you haven't explained why this is I'm
(1:38:07) going back to the debate we've been circling this let's just for context can you restate what your argument is as to
(1:38:13) why it's good other than GDP is that your only argument uh I also believe that it is good because I think it is a
(1:38:19) liberal value to uh give people free why are liberal values good uh I think it leads to the highest level of flourishing within a society okay so
(1:38:25) it's a circle thank you good job all axioms are circular good job no no no they're not all circular yes i'm not a
(1:38:31) foundationalist are circular right but I'm not a foundationalist so doesn't matter all axioms are circular not everything no listen god is good how do
(1:38:38) you know that all axioms are circular it's it's it's fundamental it's fundamental to Can I just claim that
(1:38:44) it's fundamental does that make it so it this is like being like how do you know that correct yeah it's called epistemology is the probability factor
(1:38:51) it's like epistemology that's that's what it is it's called epistemology so what's the justification for that for
(1:38:58) which that all axioms are circular because they're foundational they're foundational ideas that would mean that
(1:39:03) they're circular right so that's a circle so your argument for how you know that is that it's a circle i'm saying no
(1:39:10) what I'm saying when you refute when you refute my claim by going circular I'm asking you a circular also how do you
(1:39:16) know that is what I'm asking it's foundational it's just like basic basic presupposition you understand and that's
(1:39:22) not you don't even know what a presupposition what presuppositions are no you don't because if I can if you can do that in a debate that means I can do
(1:39:28) that in the debate so there's no debate possible i can just say all of my beliefs and my positions
(1:39:33) are are foundational and aimatic it's almost like I said I could agrip a trillemma you too and then it would be
(1:39:38) stupid that's not what we're talking about that's exactly what we're talking about yes tell me what an epistemic typically when we engage in debates
(1:39:45) we of each other's world so that we can actually epistemic justification uh I
(1:39:51) don't know define it for me Jay well I thought you were you knew all about philosophy no you've been teaching no you told me you you said you were going
(1:39:57) to instruct me in philosophy mm-m i'm really dumb just tell me you said earlier that you knew philosophy so what is epis justification i'm pretty sure I
(1:40:04) never said that I knew philosophy in No you did you said I knew I knew nothing i knew no fallacy i laughed and said it's
(1:40:10) insane to me that you have a philosophy degree cuz I'm assuming you know philosophy but you don't know multiple fallacies and you you unironically are
(1:40:17) trying to say that the optim i'm sorry that you're having a hard time but this is how we do debates
(1:40:23) okay what's the argument for feminism other than GDP and it's just good and it's
(1:40:30) liberal uh okay so do you understand that I can then come to the debate and say that it's good because it's not
(1:40:36) liberal okay and then I would say why do you not value liberalism you're missing the point because why do you not value liberalism it's not that's not an
(1:40:43) argument i think liberalism leads to higher leveling based on every single statistical norm that we have that exists out there that's what I value i
(1:40:50) think that when people are doing the fact that you value happier healthier fuller mentally mentally the fact that
(1:40:56) you value that doesn't make it an argument that's the point i believe that God wants us to be happy healthy just
(1:41:02) appealing to that doesn't do anything for your case there there is I'm telling you Jay there's nothing I can say that
(1:41:07) you're not going to throw circular because you're not making arguments correct that's what you're unwilling to
(1:41:13) any level of norm are not arguments okay yeah in a debate I'm not going to grant you normativity i've supplied
(1:41:19) evidence for it and then you've just gone it's circular no you're the one that's like losing it and flapping i've
(1:41:25) said GDP i said flourishing is good because it improves why is that the good i believe that it is good because I
(1:41:30) think all the fact that you believe that doesn't make it good because I think that God wants us to be happy healthy whole and good people and I think that
(1:41:36) liberal societ I think that liberal societies produce all of those outcomes to the
(1:41:41) highest level that doesn't mean that I think that God is a liberal by any means god is so much more and beyond all of
(1:41:46) that but I think by and large the liberal system to the greatest possible God is so much bigger than any label or
() 
(1:41:53) construct that any human can apply to him i don't even know why you're saying that because it's a dumb argument what you're saying it would be a dumb
(1:41:59) argument for me to apply political [ __ ] label to the omnipotent you just said that liberal societies are good
(1:42:06) that's what you appeal to in terms of divine command theory so that would make God illiberal no it wouldn't at all
(1:42:11) because I'm sure you can conceive of a world your own i'm sure you can conceive of a world where God is more than any
(1:42:17) political system just saying God's more my bestation of how to engage if I promote
(1:42:22) liberalism then I'm a liberal i don't think so you have conflicting
(1:42:28) positions i think liberalism strikes as close no not at all you're just not engaging with you literally can't think
(1:42:33) through your own arguments so sad you actually can't understand you said that liberal society is what God wants but
(1:42:39) God's not say that i didn't say that i said that what God wants is for people to be happy healthy whole and that's
(1:42:44) your liberal society i think a liberal society leads us towards that the best that we have created so far then God
(1:42:50) wants a liberal society i'm sure that God wants something more for us than that but that's a partial
(1:42:55) fallacy the fact that he wants it more doesn't mean that he doesn't want the liberalism that No God is not follow no
(1:43:02) God is not a liberal i'm not applying your own position would mean he is you No it wouldn't i already No I No Jay
(1:43:07) i've already said that God is more the fact that he's more doesn't mean that he's not promoting the liberalism that
(1:43:12) you just argued he does okay Jay can you summarize my argument in any way it's not there's no argument it's literal
(1:43:18) child yapping it's like a three-year-old yapping out of my then it should be really easy for you there is no argument
(1:43:24) to summarize summarize it anyways happy healthy whole flourishing society is liberal and that's what God wants
(1:43:31) therefore God's a liberal no none of these are my arguments it would follow no it wouldn't that's literally what you
(1:43:37) just said no you said God wants a liberal society i said it's the closest appro approximation to what I think God
(1:43:44) wants then he wants that no he probably wants something more for us than that then it's still part of that if he wants
(1:43:49) more possible that it's it's [ __ ] some debate the whole debate you've
(1:43:54) misunderstood what part fallacies are when you go home I want you to get on your computer and I want you to watch a
(1:44:00) few talks on what a parts hole fallacy is because you've made that multiple times and I want you to look up what an
(1:44:05) ad hole i'm actually telling you how you would do better i know you don't understand right now because you're in
(1:44:10) your emotions because you're partial fallacy i'm not losing you're just not engaging you're losing it because you
(1:44:17) don't know what you're saying it's just endless like if you don't want to engage so you would be a better debater if you knew what a parcel fallacy was i'm
(1:44:23) trying to help you if you could even slightly engage in my normativity so that we could have a conversation i'm
(1:44:28) not going to grant you that it's a debate the way that you think you don't know how debates work i'm not going to grant you normative you don't understand
(1:44:34) anything about work with She wants me to grant her her position in the debate yes typically when you engage No that's not
(1:44:40) so debates work by granting positions this is what she thinks it it it enga you grant one another's normatively
(1:44:46) framework no you don't yes you do i don't yes you do i don't then then you end up at a grippa's trilmma no you end
(1:44:53) up at you floundering and losing your mind and flaming out why does God want the world that you
(1:44:59) want i can make that argument make it my worldview is coherent it makes sense why
(1:45:04) does God want all of history all of history has been patriarchal societies in terms of Christian and Old Testament
(1:45:10) Hebrew revelation they're patriarch wants that though by your own argument you argue that it's divine command
(1:45:15) theory in the Old Testament so you already aditted it's patriarchal what value what God value is coming out of that god the father is a patriarch god
(1:45:23) wants patriarchy specifically the father is a patriarch because he's a patriarch
(1:45:28) so oh isn't that a little circular i don't have a problem with circular arguments oh interesting okay so God
(1:45:34) wants a patriarchy because he's a patriarch therefore God is good and patriarchy is good because God is a patriarch and turning on a bunch of like
(1:45:40) adding a bunch of That's a really nice circle see how we can just end up in a grippa trillemma together and it's stupid so instead the difference between
(1:45:47) what I do is I will just grant you elements of your so that we can engage i don't I
(1:45:53) don't I'm a presuppositionalist that means I don't your position which is probably why you're a really annoying
(1:45:58) person to debate and that's why 15 years but you think that you you're not winning you're not winning by just
(1:46:04) engaging in a grippa's trillemma all you're doing is you don't even understand the debate yes I do you don't
(1:46:09) what's you don't understand what a paradigm level is define it you don't understand what a paradigm level critique is before I keep going can you
(1:46:16) define a you don't understand what a paradigm level critique is what's a grippa trend I'm not going to answer your questions because you don't know
() 
(1:46:21) what a paradigm level critique is okay well how is any of that where is the proof for feminism
(1:46:27) What's a grippers where is the proof for feminism what's a grippa trion where is the proof for feminism i gave you multiple pieces of evidence so you don't
(1:46:32) have an argument for feminism i have multiple other evidence no evidences are not arguments an evidence evidences are
(1:46:38) arguments no they're not yes they are yes they are evidence is back up arguments you idiot an evidence is not
(1:46:45) an argument yes you use premises oh my god you're so evidence is not an
(1:46:50) argument it backs it up that's a grip trma an evidence is not an argument
(1:46:55) you use evidences support arguments you [ __ ] wow you're so smart Jade you
(1:47:00) really got me with that one stupid mistakes you really got me with that one what's the argument for feminism what's a grippa tile what's the argument for
(1:47:07) feminism what's a grippa's trilmma what's the argument for feminism i've made it multiple times you gave evidence not an argument just because you don't
(1:47:12) like it you gave evidences not an argument what's a Gria's trillemma you gave evidences not an argument my
(1:47:20) argument is supplied by the evidences it is good for society that's my argument and I said "What's the good that relies
(1:47:26) on?" The good which is what flourishing happiness well-being and God's a liberal
(1:47:31) like sovereignty and God's a liberal because he wants a liberal society god's a liberal i said "Of course God is so much more than anything we could ever
(1:47:37) apply a construct to because I'm not a [ __ ] heretic are you crazy i would never apply." You don't see the divorce
(1:47:44) between those i would never apply I'm sorry it's like talking to a woman god is sacred to me i would never apply a
(1:47:49) label to God ever about anything even So he wants a liberal society but he's not own so he wants a liberal society is not
(1:47:55) a liberal he wants so much more that's a partial fallacy you idiot that doesn't matter oh fallacies don't matter thank
(1:48:01) you yeah when you when you abuse them incorrectly yeah they don't really matter do you think that God is any
(1:48:07) political system what political system do you think God wants yeah i think God wants a
(1:48:13) patriarchy patriarchy isn't a political system it's a hierarchical system to a political system that doesn't matter there's there's patriarchies in
(1:48:19) democracies monarchy in the Old Testament so God wants a monarchy yeah he was a patriarchal deity oh has
(1:48:25) Christianity had anything but monarchies for the last comfortable capturing the entire
(1:48:31) visage of God in a single political system you're comfortable with that did
(1:48:36) I say his visage is encaptured you said that God wants a monarchy so God's a monarchist correct wow that's crazy i'm
(1:48:43) not heretical like that i don't know what to tell you heretical yes i would never apply you have no idea what heresy
(1:48:48) even is okay what's a Gria's trilmma do you want to answer that what is an Orthodox
(1:48:54) Protestant first of all the thing that you made up and put in your bio what is that uh it's a branch of theology that
(1:49:00) is postmodern and it more or less tries to engage with the Bible that's heresy right it's not heresy postmodernism is heresy that's not heresy yes it is yeah
(1:49:07) it has nothing to do with Christianity i'm sorry it's the Bible in the way that it was written can you name any Christians in history that were
(1:49:13) postmodernists the original ones yeah really like who paul paul was a postmodernist yeah to some degree a 20th
(1:49:20) century philosophy that developed out of France you don't even know what Paul was a postmodernist this is how stupid you
(1:49:27) are you have no clue what you're talking about you're a total sue how did Paul engage did you think that because you
(1:49:33) knew destiny and just yapping really fast that you would be a good debater how could Paul be a postmodernist do you
(1:49:39) want Do you want me to answer was Was Paul talking to Derida was he talking to Dereda remember how was Paul talking to
(1:49:46) Derida just because they weren't invented yet doesn't mean that you can't apply i have no idea what you're talking about now you're making my argument
(1:49:51) thank you for aditting my argument thank you for admitting my argument 2 hours ago good job you just lost again wow
(1:49:58) this is crazy i won he just made weird noises what's a Gria's trillemma you don't know you're avoiding this cuz you
(1:50:04) have no idea your argument for feminism what's a Grippa's trilmma what's your argument for feminism i haven't heard
(1:50:09) anything other than No you didn't make an argument you just said GDP why is GDP good way more than GDP at this point why
(1:50:16) is a grip's tral is what you said what's a grippa's trilmma why is God a liberal i don't
(1:50:23) know why I can't answer this why is God a liberal i've never applied that that's your straw man why is God a liberal why are you straw maning me why is God a
(1:50:29) liberal why are you straw manning me you said that he wants a liberal society n therefore he I never said that now
(1:50:35) you're lying again you said 30 minutes ago he wants a liberal society i said it's the closest approximation to
() 
(1:50:40) something that God wants for us then he wants that no he would want so much more for us the fact that he wants more doesn't mean he doesn't want that if
(1:50:46) he's pushing that you just argued from divine command theory that's what he wants no yes you did no he wants more
(1:50:53) than that yes you did no the fact that he wants more than that doesn't mean that he doesn't want that no it's part
(1:50:59) of the more do you think he wants more than monarchy or It doesn't matter to the argument does he end at So you can't
(1:51:05) do a partialole fallacy does he Does he end it's a partsole fallacy if you want If you want to do fallacy game again
(1:51:12) tell me what a grippers trailer is answering any of your objections or questions until you give an argument for
(1:51:18) feminis what is the argument for feminism other than GDP and God liberal a grippa's
(1:51:23) trilmma is really important to understand anytime a person tries to hit you with this like circular like normative like no argument you made any
(1:51:31) sense you're not even doing what you have to hit them back with is essentially a Grippa's trilmma which is that she's just repeating what you heard
(1:51:36) destiny truly she's just repeating some [ __ ] from destiny i don't think I've ever heard him ever talk about what's the argument for feminism other than GDP
(1:51:42) and god liberal when you're dealing with people who just like constantly fall back circular reasoning and
(1:51:47) like none of this stuff makes any sense a grippa tile basically points out that every single argument fundamentally at
(1:51:54) like a foundational level never truly makes sense there's some level of like ambiguous up you talking to up here out
(1:52:02) there's nobody up there i'm right here why are you wearing a silly shirt how come you have to close your eyes why do you have floaters in your eyes look how
(1:52:08) stupid that Yeah it's stupid it's stupid i'm not saying it's a sick burn and pointing out how silly your behavior is
(1:52:14) so it do you want to engage in a Gria's trillemma because then you and I can just do turtles all the way down if you
(1:52:20) want to again which is part of a gria's trust he doesn't know what it is and he won't define it he's just going to run
(1:52:25) away forever i don't accept the infinite regress at all oh wow how do you do that
(1:52:30) how do I do that i don't have that philosophical system yeah but how do you solve it it's not a problem it's not a
(1:52:36) philosophical system infinite regress is not a philosophical system it's a foundational issue to every single philosophical system i'm aware of that
(1:52:43) i'm a presuppositionalist i know how that works right so there's always a why behind your presuppositions right what
(1:52:49) does that have to do with us that's what infinite regress is yeah there's a behind infinite regress you're not going to convince anyone in the audience that
(1:52:55) you're trumping me here because all systems say that but he still won't define every time I try to answer you
(1:53:01) just keep yapping it's only me that's interrupting you're right you don't shut up when you ask the questions i have a
(1:53:07) worldview view of apologetics and debate okay it's epistemic holism i said that
(1:53:12) like 10 times earlier which you didn't hear it didn't register with you so I'm not subject to a position that's a
(1:53:19) foundationalist critique okay i'm not I'm not an epistemic foundationalist so that doesn't apply to me i don't have
(1:53:25) that system wow you've solved a grippa trillemma yes because I'm not in that system that's crazy that's not possible
(1:53:31) just so everyone tell that is impossible tell me what a presuppositional argument is since you're saying that this is my
(1:53:36) position what is it uh a presuppositional argument is where you have uh like a presupposing of God like
(1:53:43) God is a presuppositional argument there's there's some foundational initial cause and everything kind of comes from there no that's the
(1:53:49) cosmological argument that's not the presuppositional argument okay why don't you tell me what it is it's just simply an epistemic position that all arguments
(1:53:55) at root are circular not every argument but foundational commitments in a
(1:54:02) worldview are circular so my fundamental commitment to God or to teology or to
(1:54:07) causation or to morals or ethics is going to be self-referencing to God but not all arguments and positions are
(1:54:13) circular so the trilmma or the problem or whatever you're giving to me doesn't apply to my How do you solve dogmatism
(1:54:20) with that all positions are dogmatic and so coherentism
(1:54:25) coherentism is the solution that you're looking for true okay so you solve that coherentism is the solution that you're
(1:54:32) looking for m gotcha okay can you tell me what that is coherentism would be like something's consistent all the way
(1:54:37) through correct so I'm a coherent do I get like a head pat i'm a coherentist there's There's
(1:54:44) the answer to your question i'm not a foundationalist gotcha you're a foundationalist that's
(1:54:49) why I didn't grant you the normativity at the beginning of the debate gotcha well you know what if he's going to
(1:54:55) answer for me then I honestly probably don't need to be here you could just make my arguments for me there's no
(1:55:00) point i'm answering your question that you asked me you said "How do I solve these dilemmas?" And I gave you the answer here's the difference right you
(1:55:05) just don't like the answer i'm sorry no I'm I'm just willing to grant you your worldview i'm fine with it i don't do that in debates you have to
(1:55:12) otherwise you end up here you don't grant a person the otherwise you end up at dogmatism and I end up at infinite
(1:55:18) regression that's why I did an internal critique okay that has to do with coherentism
(1:55:24) yeah the the problem with dogmatism is that it's circular and the problem with infinite regress is it fundamentally a
(1:55:29) circuit all positions are dogmatic at root is what I'm arguing so it's a question of coherence which is why you
(1:55:34) allow incoherence and why your position is incoherent which is why you grant some level of normativity yes you do you
(1:55:41) you must and you don't understand debate the issue is that my my positions are coherent as well i think yes they are
(1:55:47) they're just coherent in your head because they're self you just don't like them you literally grounded it in your own subjective that's not an argument
(1:55:54) why aren't you making an argument what what do you mean you're not making an argument you appealed to yourself what
(1:56:00) do you mean that's not true i'm a divine command theorist were you not listening you saying that is not an argument your
(1:56:07) argument that's not an argument either that's a two quot what's your position that's a two Quoquay that's not a two Quoquay how is it not because a two
(1:56:13) Quoquay is an adome based on hypocrisy i didn't accuse you of hypocrisy you said that's your position you just literally
(1:56:18) just said that she knew that oh no she used the fallacy wrong again you literally just said that to me i'm realizing that to debate Jay I just have
(1:56:25) to memorize every single fallacy because I think you used them all i'm pretty sure debates relate to false analogy
(1:56:31) incorrectly you quay incorrectly you made the false analogy you idiot no no
(1:56:36) you made the false analogy not me you engage in an ecological fallacy you made the false analogy and then you misstated
(1:56:43) what my argument was cuz you can't follow it the key to debating Jay is memorizing lists of fallacies yeah I'm
(1:56:48) pretty sure that the laws of thought he uses the laws of thought matter in a debate i'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure
(1:56:54) the laws of thought matter in a debate were you miser intentionally i didn't
(1:56:59) cite it wrong i cited it correctly you literally just turned it back and said "Will you do this?" That's not a two no
(1:57:06) it's not i wasn't accusing you of hypocrisy yes you did you said that I was making the same argument that's not
(1:57:13) a two quotequote yes it is you're calling me hypocritical that's not hypocrisy i'm not accusing you of
(1:57:18) hypocrisy hypocrisy would be if you say one thing and then do a different thing like if you're like "Don't smoke." And
(1:57:23) I'm like "But you're smoking Jay." That would be a two quote don't smoke is a completely valid argument regardless of
(1:57:29) whether you use what you're yapping about that's crazy you just actually site these incorrectly and then you have
(1:57:37) a child level understanding of what the definition is at a website and what you did was So here we go again you can't
(1:57:46) even talk like a normal person neither do you you literally lose your mind rolling your eyes you're basically right
(1:57:52) now you're basically having you're basically having like an epileptic episode trying to debate because you
(1:57:58) can't handle a normal conversation so I started very good
(1:58:03) faith where are you looking right now Jay directly at you why why are you doing that because normal people look at
(1:58:10) people they don't stare up into the sky and have that blood exile oh yeah you're right she's so wrong cuz you looked into the sky got him no you're just yapping
(1:58:17) and you don't even understand the things you're talking about i am literally I don't know so chat just so you guys
(1:58:23) realize what I've done for the last hour is unironically just employed Jayisms back at him for an hour straight that's
(1:58:30) what I've been doing sounds really really stupid her tactic was to not actually debate but to just mimic
(1:58:36) there's no way to debate which is interesting because women basically women basically just mimic
(1:58:43) men because you didn't have an actual argument the moment back on like basically circular reasoning and just
(1:58:50) insisting that you were I gave you the answers and you didn't know what they were as an
(1:58:58) epist so instead all I opted to do for the last like hour and a half your behavior there's no one over here I'm
(1:59:04) looking at the camera but you know you're looking at the wall i don't know why you're so worried i'm having an epilepsy episode just relax do you need
(1:59:10) your Do you have Do you need a medicine for the epilepsy or I'm worried about where I'm looking this is funny like
(1:59:17) because you can't I'm not even sure you can't have a conversation look in the person's eye yes when I think I look up
(1:59:23) good for you good good point got them destroyed
(1:59:29) what is the argument for feminism other than GDP is that it uh I believe that it is good for society because it leads to
(1:59:34) overall flourishing which was economic liberal liberalism well-being um what
(1:59:40) does that mean well-being typically is measured by like positive mental health some level of udemonic expression um and
(1:59:47) some level of like self-report of udemonic expression um it also leads to things like less missed work um greater
(1:59:55) social connections uh greater access to opportunities all sorts of things that I think are broadly good for society leads
(2:00:01) to better outcomes leads to happier people and I think by and large God doesn't want us to like be punished
(2:00:06) arbitrarily for no reason so I think he more or less wants a society that allows us to express in the way that we want to which is a liberal society uh there's
(2:00:14) probably multiple societies that would allow this in the future not just a liberal one does he want a liberal one right now i don't know but earlier you
(2:00:22) argued that it was God i hope so yeah I hope so i believe so but now you don't know you said God earlier divine command
(2:00:27) theory now you don't know so which one is it well it's it's both right because I it's both I don't know end to my I'm
(2:00:32) not like when it comes to my faith I try to contradictions do you want me to answer were you contradicted well to
(2:00:38) some degree yeah i think there's a paradox yeah there's a paradox there's a paradox of faith that you have to hold where you're paradox is not a
(2:00:44) contradiction you they're two different things that's true did you know that that's true it's almost like I'm So now
(2:00:49) you're appealing to a paradox to get up do you want me to answer okay i'll I'll Do you want me to answer you please contradict the way okay so I think when
(2:00:56) it comes to things like my faith I try to engage in some level of epistemic humility where I both do my best to
(2:01:01) understand what God wants through divine command theory through exodus is Jesus and divine revelation however at the
(2:01:06) same time I maintain a level of epistemic humility of recognizing that I could be go wrong about the infinite God
() 
(2:01:13) which is why I said I don't know but I hope so so the appeal to divine command theory actually doesn't work no it does
(2:01:18) work not to ground your position sure it does how because I'm using exogesis isogesis and divine revelation to try to
(2:01:24) understand words doesn't mean that it actually works for an argument it does work for an argument rattling out the
(2:01:29) terms exesus that is looking at a text and getting out of the text what it
(2:01:35) means reading into the text yeah and what's isogesis isogesis is reading into the text and then what's divine
(2:01:41) revelation all the teachings of Christ contained in scripture and tradition in our view and I'm sure I'm sure you would
(2:01:48) agree that these are typically the three things taught in most theological schools that you should utilize to try to understand what God's will is and
(2:01:53) what his principles are but that doesn't mean that you have an argument because you're appealing to what's taught in seminaries that's what I'm trying to get
(2:01:58) you my argument is based on divine command theory and I use exes Jesus Jesus to try to understand what I think
(2:02:04) God wants and then I try to apply that to the world but I'm telling you why it's not a good argument because it's coherent you just don't no it's not
(2:02:09) because you just said that I don't know if it's right and so I can't appeal to the court do you know exactly what God
(2:02:15) wants in all ways you just know all of God now it's not divine command theory of course it is but you don't know what
(2:02:21) God wants i do my best do you think that you know do you know what he wants or or not i think so yeah that's what faith is
(2:02:28) right you think so was that an argument i that's an honest response to my my
(2:02:34) relationship with Christ are you good but how is that an argument confident that you know what God wants how is that
(2:02:40) an argument are you 100% confident that you know what God wants my subjective state of confidence doesn't matter about an argument or not do you think that you
(2:02:46) know 100% what God wants this is the problem is that you think that your subjective state of argumentation or of
(2:02:53) con being convinced relates to an argument and it doesn't no not at all do you think that you know what God
(2:03:00) wants yeah sure oh so would you say that you're using your subjective state to interpret the world around you do you
(2:03:06) think that because everyone has a subjective state that everything is subjective nope I don't okay so then
(2:03:11) there's there's your answer okay interesting so I also would agree that just because I'm using my best
(2:03:16) interpretation it doesn't mean that it's subjective because I'm using things like exigesus exesus is not subjective as
(2:03:22) much as possible right you're using ancient toms you're looking at Greek literatures you're listening to rabbis and the original readers of the language
(2:03:28) to try to understand what like exodus means right that's exugesus and so that
(2:03:33) is not subjective ideally ideally the goal is to be as less subjective as possible that would make my point that
(2:03:40) it's not subjective and so you are appealing to something that you claim to know but then isogesus is reading into
(2:03:45) it as well which we have to do with this because that's the level of like uh self-interpretation every single
(2:03:51) Christian is doing in fact you're doing to try to understand your divine command theory what does this have to do with
(2:03:56) proving your argument pointing out that we're doing the same thing but that doesn't mean you're getting to the same
(2:04:01) conclusions or it's a good argument you're right we do come to different conclusions but that doesn't mean that mine is somehow how does this relate to
(2:04:07) your argument because we're using the same thing and so what the use of the thing has nothing to do with the
(2:04:12) argument you're using your own logic to establish why I am being coded i want to know your argument you're just saying
(2:04:18) that I use these things i've already said Good job how's that an argument it's an it is using the things is the
(2:04:25) argument no it's not my argument is that feminism is good because it does a number of things which I've listed
(2:04:31) multiple times and you appealed that on the basis of divine command theory and now you say that I don't know what's
(2:04:37) wrong why don't we have an interesting conversation and you argue with me about like GDP or like whether it actually
(2:04:43) leads because we're going to the thing rather than presuppos like presuppositionalism because it's what your argument is based
(2:04:49) on if I undo that your argument falls that's why and it did it it didn't you just don't
(2:04:56) like it we're we're using gave a dumb argument no we're using the same system we're using the same system using that
(2:05:01) how does that how does that help your argument because what it means is that we're both being coherent but we still end up i don't have your views yeah you
(2:05:07) do you're you're divine i don't have your views aren't you a divine command theorist i have a different account of what that means do you understand you
(2:05:13) don't use exogesis is divine revelation different things in different systems do you not use these three things to understand using them has nothing to do
(2:05:19) with whether that's backs up your argument interesting so you will agree that basically you're doing the same thing as me to build up your
(2:05:25) presupposition but somehow my presupposition is incoherent but yours is super coherent how does the use prove
(2:05:32) that your conclusions are correct it doesn't thank you but it doesn't prove yours either it doesn't prove yours
(2:05:38) either even if it doesn't it means that your argument doesn't prove feminism and your argument doesn't prove anything
(2:05:44) either because of feminism you're here to prove that patriarchy is good if you failed in your
(2:05:49) argument then you've lost you have to prove feminism is bad you have to do the same thing by you just giving a bad
(2:05:55) argument any arguments that any of your presupposition all I have to do is internally critique you and let you flounder and refute yourself and then no
() 
(2:06:02) one has it's not an argument though that's not a debate it's not an argument no it's not it's interesting in any way
(2:06:08) i don't care if it's interesting is that like your desperate friend idea of what's interesting I
(2:06:14) liked so she's right this is why you're yelling and melting down is because when you got yelling and melting down Jay
(2:06:20) when you because you can't talk you can't listen i have to talk over you because you're losing here you didn't give an argument i've given an argument
(2:06:27) no you excuses your arguments are not arguments they're assertions
(2:06:33) okay Jay got to let some chats come through we're about at the 2hour mark so we'll get the
(2:06:39) closing statements in in just a bit the TTS has been lowered we're going to do a roast session if you want $69 TTS
() 
(2:06:46) streamlabs.com/w whatever if you want to get a roast in also be sure to stay tuned guys as we're winding down this
(2:06:52) debate uh Kyla here is sticking around for another debate we have Jim Bob in uh
(2:06:59) in studio in uh I think we're going to go live in about an hour hour hour and a
(2:07:05) half we're going to break for a bit let me let these chats come through we have Chef Dill Pickles thank you for that
(2:07:10) chef Dill Pickles donated $100 did not so bright ever kick that wine habit she isn't slurring tonight
(2:07:18) but none of her arguments have improved wine drinker nope not really okay we
(2:07:23) have uh Silent here with a $100 super chat thank you so much Silent for your $100 blank super chat thank you so much
(2:07:30) man lucas uh follows up on his previous super chat yes my wife is actually watching me bullying you online and
(2:07:37) always watches whatever with me she's quite entertained that said you call it bullying i just see it as calling a
(2:07:43) spade a spade sorry truth can sometimes be disquing you want to do a quick response to that or uh there there's
(2:07:50) there's nothing to respond to like yeah me and my wife both enjoy being mean to women online like you're welcome for the
(2:07:56) foreplay I guess i don't know okay there you go thank you Lucas always good to see you in the chat thank you thank you
(2:08:02) we have Christopher Scott here with a message thank you Christopher christopher Scott donated
(2:08:08) $100 wait did she just gods a relativist we he approaches things what nonsense is
() 
(2:08:13) that any response yes i said that God is a relativist you can just like look
(2:08:19) through scripture and see that he like is constantly saying totally refuted yourself for example there's multiple verses where he says like things that
(2:08:25) were wrong back then or weren't wrong back then were not wrong because they didn't understand yes he regularly updates that
(2:08:33) is what relativism is yes it is it is absolutely relativism it's understanding people within the context of where they
(2:08:38) are and applying rules it's not relativism yes it is no it isn't that does not make God a relativist you were
(2:08:44) indoctrinated with postmodernism and that's why you thought St paul was a postmodernist so you don't have a clue
(2:08:49) what you're talking about okay good job all right we have another chat here we have Grid One big Grid One thank you man
(2:08:55) oh there it is grid One Motorsports donated $200
(2:09:02) erodite it is super interesting to watch you try and walk the line trying to claim patriarchy and feminism are not at
(2:09:09) odds when feminism has its base in the destruction of patriarch yep uh yeah I
(2:09:14) just think that when feminists do that it's it's harmful i don't think that patriarchy by itself is bad but I do think that patriarchy that like is
(2:09:20) enforced is bad and so like feminism is at its root trying to block the obstacles by which we make patriarchy a
(2:09:28) necessity rather than like allowing patriarchy to emerge naturally so another way to show that she lost the
(2:09:33) debate is that her position is unfalsifiable because anytime it gets challenged she can redefine the terms to
(2:09:40) be whatever it needs to be at that moment and if you go back and watch the debate she did that multiple times and
(2:09:45) that's why feminism the definition was broad enough to fit this it wasn't
(2:09:51) actually broad enough again if you didn't like you thought ancient
(2:09:56) Israelites were feminist yeah yeah to some degree for feminism is a historical
(2:10:01) movement you goober again just a modern movement do you think that trans people only existed after we made up the word
(2:10:08) feminist movement is what's what's being debated not it's not it's literally it's
(2:10:14) literally not it's feminism I'm pretty sure the title is is feminism right it's
(2:10:19) it's a concept it's not is the feminist movement the feminist movement is what I'm debating that's not what I came here
(2:10:25) to debate the question is is good you did come to debate feminism do you think that transminism began to exist after
(2:10:32) the word was invented that was the only time people feminism is the thing that we're debating which is a historical
(2:10:37) movement do you think that like any admitted exist until we already aditted it's a historical movement like
(2:10:43) crocodile until we made the word crocodile already admitted in the debate it's a historical movement of course
(2:10:48) it's a historical movement that just has nothing to do with anything because feminism is concept for the fourth time
(2:10:53) you contradict yourself because you said that the history man today said a word can mean two different things feminist
(2:10:59) as a movement is not what I'm here to defend feminism as a concept is you admitted an hour ago that the movement
(2:11:07) is necessarily bound up with the history you idiot that has nothing to do with
(2:11:12) the Thank you lost again for the 10th time the debate again if you if you like
(2:11:18) if you desperately need all of history to define a concept that's fine for historical concepts yes like movements
(2:11:26) like social movements that come out of the French Revolution obvious yeah so a a a movement can create a concept and
(2:11:33) then the concept can then be retroactively applied to other instances that you saw in history it's not retroactive absolutely true this is why
(2:11:39) Paul's not a postmodernist you moral this is why we can call people democracies before postmodernist this is
(2:11:46) why Paul is not a postmodernist this is why this is why for example we would say that the founding fathers created a
(2:11:53) democracy even though they didn't invent the word democracy yet you can retroactively apply concept yes you can
(2:12:00) paul is not a postmodernist i I'm I'm sorry paul is not a postmodernist this is so stupid this is
(2:12:06) the dumbest thing I've ever heard engaged with the Bible he engaged with the Bible the same way that I post a
(2:12:11) stupid stupider statement than that you don't even know what I think jay
(2:12:18) you have blabbered the most insane spaghetti diarrhea nonsense what is
(2:12:23) Protestant what is What is What is it what's radical orthodoxy i
(2:12:30) don't know what you've made up you shut your mouth oh so you're just admitting that you don't even know what I'm
(2:12:35) supposed to know your madeup Protestant you're attacking me for it so you should Yeah probably have an idea of what it is
(2:12:41) it's gibberish it's madeup nonsense there is no such thing as your madeup radical Protestant Orthodoxy i know
(2:12:46) radical Orthodoxy just isn't I don't know what your position is it just is a theological branch i don't know what I'm supposed to know her position is you
(2:12:52) could ask me and then engage with me based on it i don't care about your crazy position then why are we debating at all why are you here you came to
(2:13:00) defend your position you came to defend your position as well and you haven't given an argument for feminism i have given an argument for feminism multiple
(2:13:06) times if you want to keep laughing about the po Paul postmodernist thing you can just ask me what I mean by that but you
(2:13:12) don't want to you just want to be bad you just want to be bad faith and then blabber on so that like your audience
(2:13:19) it's such an absurd statement but it explains how cuz he keeps saying that he's winning explains
(2:13:24) how you're able to read back into history all these positions that I know that you're smarter than this which means that I know that you're being bad
(2:13:30) faith right now and there's nothing that I can do in a conversation other than be bad faith back there's nothing there's no there's no we're at an impass just
(2:13:37) keep talking it's convincing everybody in my position please speak all right we let me let the chats come through we have uh Nollie looks like bought
(2:13:44) something at shop.what whatever.com she bought a hoodie thank you so much or maybe it's a it's a guy thank you Nollie
(2:13:50) for Appreciate that Giovani thank you thank you Giovani jade you donated $100
(2:13:56) thank you Giovani you are absolutely a heretic herodite this would have been way better if Jay in good faith pushed
(2:14:02) Herodit's understanding of Christianity with an intention to correct her well the debate wasn't Christianity the
(2:14:07) debate is feminism so yeah all right that would be stupid also just want to be clear as a Christian you should be really really So I think that what he's
(2:14:14) applying to like one thing is heretical i don't think that Jay is a heretic and as a Christian to Christian you should
(2:14:19) be really really really really really cautious when commenting on the like the state of people's salvation like just in
(2:14:25) general and I'm sure you would agree with this i'm not at any point going to say that I think Jay is or isn't saved somebody saying that I'm an outright
(2:14:31) heretic is essentially implying that I'm going to help,23 appreciate it she keeps bringing
(2:14:38) up the trma you can keep asking but he's asking for evidence to back up your
(2:14:43) claims at equals asserting a belief someone then asking why and why you
(2:14:49) believe that and so on yeah so we did that and I gave reasons why and then I
(2:14:54) started getting into evidence and then he said "Oh evidence is an arguments." So then we circle all the way back up
(2:14:59) well you know it's not right you know that an evidence is not an argument yep and so we circled back to my thesis and
(2:15:05) then I to my thesis and then I my arguments and evidence again and then he
(2:15:10) said "Uh that's not an argument that's evidence." And so we circle back and
(2:15:15) back and back because Jay can't actually engage with a concept he has to just constantly attack basically semantics
(2:15:22) i'm going to tell you this one time and I'm not ever going to say this again tampons do not exist that one's true
(2:15:28) actually he's cooking with that one okay there you go we have Cleap is it going to come through one
(2:15:34) sec there it is thank you Cleap appreciate it cleap donated $100 if NSE believes ancient Israel was
(2:15:42) a feminist society would she be happy with us moving to their gender norms if
(2:15:47) not doesn't this demonstrate Jay's points that her definition is too broad quick response to this uh yeah I don't
(2:15:53) believe that Israel was broadly a feminist society i think that it was had more levels of feminism that I was
(2:15:58) talking about than other societies around it but by no means would I like encapsulate that as like that's not feminism yes it is feminism is a push
(2:16:05) feminism is a is an action it is a movement towards empowering women with historical movement it's not an ancient
(2:16:11) Israelite movement that again you can apply words that were invented later historically which is why we can say the
(2:16:18) founding fathers invented a liberal democracy even though they didn't use the words back then yes you I'm sorry
(2:16:24) you're fundamentally wrong about this you absolutely can and if you won't do
(2:16:29) that that's why it's an ambiguity fallacy because you can make the position unfalsifiable i'm not making it
(2:16:35) if that's the case I could say that everything in history is patriarchy have to do because history was patriarchal
(2:16:40) all you have to do to dismantle my argument is prove that doesn't empower women that's that's all you could do you
(2:16:46) could do that the internal critiques already did that which you didn't even understand nope again you just all you
(2:16:51) did yeah just say no and it makes I'm just going to have a meta conversation just for sake of time just got moving on
(2:16:57) though but uh grandma's sweaters thank you for donating $100 i don't mind women in the workforce
(2:17:04) thank you it's not inherently bad the fundamental issue is feminism also divorces God and God's reps trades which
(2:17:12) leads to polarization and societal conflict for GDP what i see a question mark at the end
(2:17:19) there this is uh and societal conflict for GDP
(2:17:26) did they mean God at the end there i don't know how I don't know how societal conflict leads to problems with GD i'm
(2:17:33) not really sure brand those sweaters if you want to send in a clarifying message you can we have $100 intel Wild donated
(2:17:40) $69 not so bright is a miserable woman on the inside she is also a degenerate
(2:17:46) woke pig snake kuma Gremlin what what is akumor gremlin i don't know what is that
(2:17:52) i don't know what that is but I have a feeling that if I had an Only Fans this guy would be subbed to it for sure he
(2:17:57) would be subbed okay all right intel wild that I don't have one and I would never will but Nick donated 69 I have
(2:18:05) one people can go to my only humility she could learn a lot from it's me and yoga pants that's up to Jay

(2:18:19) coming in here in just a moment with a message if you want to get your own own in $69
(2:18:24) ttsstreamabs.com whatever you want to get a little message in here donated did
(2:18:30) $100 it took 2 hours but she finally said "God wants a society that allows us
(2:18:35) to express in the way that we want to." Her god is individualism just like every
(2:18:40) feminist which destroys civilization agreed five more absolutely are you
(2:18:46) opposed to individualism i'm This is not This is just a straw man
(2:18:51) my worldview i don't think it's the highest value in society of course it's not the highest but are you opposed to individualism again that's an ambiguous
(2:18:58) term depends on what you mean so you just won't answer the question okay no it's literally an ambiguous term just
(2:19:03) like most of don't like them can't do it mm- again 100 IQ maybe mac thank you you
(2:19:10) donated $69 although I agree what Jay this debate was kind of unwatchable due to the
(2:19:16) constant childish mocking having said that Erodite should have let Jay give the definition in his terms my Jesus
(2:19:25) [ __ ] Christ i give I give I would have loved I would have loved for Jay to just define his words that would have
(2:19:31) been amazing i agree honestly Mac true jay you should have defined your words if you didn't like my definitions holy
(2:19:38) [ __ ] why would I define your words you rejected mine yeah but debates are for
(2:19:43) you defending your position it's not for me defining the words for you if you don't like my definition then you should
(2:19:49) supply your own i don't have to supply your position then there's no point in talking after that if I say feminism you
() 
(2:19:55) just don't understand what a debate is and how it If I say feminism is this and you go I reject that then the onus I'm going to let you make your mistakes in a
(2:20:01) debate i'm not going to make them for you i'm not going to help you in a debate i'm going to let you define things in a dumb way and then call you out later that's how debates work have a
(2:20:08) debate about feminism if you won't supply a definition and you won't engage with my definition how do we even talk
(2:20:14) about feminism if you don't understand how debates work that I'm I'm arguing the position against your position that
(2:20:19) means you define it and you defend that so I defined it the concept and and I let you make the mistake and then you
(2:20:25) didn't like it which is fine no I said that it was inconsistent later on no you
(2:20:30) said it was too broad later on because you moved the goal post consistent i didn't move the goal post you did because you tried to make ancient
(2:20:37) Israelites feminist that's moving another one coming in here we got
(2:20:42) $69 thank you Clay appreciate it is feminism bad name one society where it would work that wasn't in a Wonder Woman
(2:20:49) movie i'mma go have a steak good to see you we back to watch her get demolished by Jim Bob wrong time of the month to
(2:20:56) have her on do you want to do a quick response to the first uh feminism is not like a societal hierarchy system maybe
(2:21:02) you're talking about matriarchies but matriarchies are broadly not that successful i don't so it's not useful to
(2:21:07) talk about Jordan $69 thank you thank you please grant my definition of good in the is
(2:21:14) feminism good debate sad exactly that you would come to a debate
(2:21:20) and think that people grant you the positions that you're defending this is why you lost this debate all I'm
(2:21:25) learning is that Haidiger you're learning that you don't know how to debate no I'm I'm learning that you literally don't want to define words
(2:21:32) because that way you can pretend to win by just No I let you hang yourself i let
(2:21:37) you hang yourself you literally didn't all I let you hang yourself you acted like a petulant you
(2:21:44) misdefined the words i didn't and moved the gold paste nope i didn't do that either you did you said ancient
(2:21:49) Israelites were feminists because they had women because they had a high view of women yeah because I I defined it as
(2:21:55) like an action word feminism the movement that we're debating you goofas define feminism differently and we can
(2:22:01) quibble about that that's the historical movements I mentioned okay yeah there we go jay as long as I quibble about words
(2:22:06) then I can pretend I won god dates donated $69 to anyone who thinks whatever only
(2:22:13) brings on dumb women I present to you Jay i love whatever i love Andrew i hate
(2:22:19) Jay she tried to try to be good faith he wanted to be nothing but bad faith
(2:22:27) i guess I got to retire no more debates for me ever again i'm retiring there it is i I think our debate could be like
(2:22:33) you're you're actually such a smart person and you're so informed we could No you just don't understand debate literally like it's I'm doing a debate
(2:22:40) at this level and you're debating right i should never be good no you just don't know what we're talking about literally
(2:22:46) it's too it's too childish too childish you're not You shouldn't debate i'm trying to tell you right now i was
(2:22:52) giving you a compliment and saying it would have Yeah but I'm helping you and giving you a compliment saying you should not debate that's not a compliment it is it's not a compliment
(2:22:59) because you're good at other things like what jay not debating okay what I was saying Jay if I could just finish this
(2:23:06) thought is that I was actually looking forward to a really interesting discussion because I think you are really philosophically grounded out and
(2:23:11) I think it could have been interesting but instead you wanted to quibble over words and just like do dumb like gotchas
(2:23:17) that are meaningless and therefore we didn't put forward any the debate's happening at a level that you're
(2:23:23) interrupting me all right uh we have get back in the kitchen get back in the
(2:23:28) kitchen woman donated $69 i am asking the most important question and we men want to know woman

(2:23:40) is a woke ass bag l Catholics uh what is your favorite sandwich to make I guess
(2:23:47) uh probably just like a panini with like lots of meat and cheese high protein love the protein we got Shaw here shaw

(2:24:10) oh Jim Bob okay and then uh guys we're going to do if you want to get one uh a couple more in last call on the uh TTS
(2:24:18) roast that's streamlabs.com/ whatever i'm going to let this one come in then we're going to do closing statements you
(2:24:24) donated $70 thank you Giovani they would agree that the OT patriarchs were Eastern Orthodox and worshiped the
(2:24:30) Trinity even though that concept as we understand it didn't exist can absolutely retroactively apply newer
(2:24:38) concepts uh Giovani thank you for that appreciate it oh interesting so uh what we're going
(2:24:45) to do now is I'm going to have each of you give a up to five minute closing
(2:24:50) statement kyla you'll go first jay you will uh you'll go after her go ahead uh
(2:24:56) sure since we basically didn't actually talk about the topic today which is unfortunate uh I guess I would I would
() 
(2:25:03) say uh debates are like this thing that I love a lot uh it doesn't mean I'm
(2:25:08) perfect or awesome at them necessarily but they're supposed to be this Socratic thing where we engage in trying to find
(2:25:15) better ideas and and and better truth essentially and you do that by being
(2:25:20) good faith to some degree by allowing and granting certain norms of one another and engaging with one another in their thought and not just like
(2:25:26) constantly falling back to like whining about words and just like bas basically
(2:25:32) just trying to insist that your opponent makes no sense based on almost nothing
(2:25:38) at all but like whining about words just like semantic arguments which is unfortunate cuz I think that this could have been a really meaningful
(2:25:44) conversation i think feminism as like a uh concept can be really valuable and I
(2:25:49) defend it a lot but I'm extremely critical of the feminist movement which I make a distinction from maybe that
(2:25:55) would have been helpful if I made that more clear i'm not probably not actually uh the feminist movement has been full
(2:26:01) of lots of pretty bad gender opportunists which is unfortunate a lot of uh civil rights movements get
(2:26:07) hijacked by bad actors and I think as a result of it it's left a lot of men with a bitter taste for feminism in their
(2:26:13) mouth and to be clear I don't think most men should be feminists i think women should be feminists because it's about women um and I think when women lie and
(2:26:20) pretend that it's about both genders it's cringe and stupid um overall I think a society that gives women more
(2:26:26) options and choices so long as they're not harming others is a good society uh and tries to incentivize good behavior i
(2:26:34) think it leads to better flourishing i think it leads to happier people um and I want a world that uh goes towards
(2:26:40) these things um what Jay wants is a world where he can yell at everyone from
(2:26:45) the top of his crownwearing throne uh about words and tell them that they don't know anything that they're talking
(2:26:51) about and then agreeing that they basically have the exact same type of like coherent presuppositional system
(2:26:56) but then insisting that you're stupid and wrong and don't know anything because he essentially disagrees with my worldview without ever actually
(2:27:02) dismantling why I'm wrong about like GDP for women he just he just literally
(2:27:08) couldn't even engage with that maybe he doesn't know what the word GDP means but he's smart so he probably does i'm not actually sure we could have had an
(2:27:15) interesting discussion instead Jay robbed you of that for I'm not really sure and then he's going to end this by
(2:27:20) insisting that he won because he caught me in all these contradictions while also just like misquing fallacies and I
(2:27:27) guess to liberals pro tips when you debate people like this you unfortunately just like have to be bad faith um and it just turns into like
(2:27:34) annoying dunk sessions where you are mean to each other um and that's all you can basically do uh which is unfortunate
(2:27:41) cuz I think we could have had a better discussion and people don't win because they say the things that you like they win because they engage in better ideas
(2:27:47) um and this unfortunately didn't happen i don't think anyone won i think everyone lost including the viewers so
(2:27:53) sorry about that guys all right Jay your closing statement i don't know if that was a diary entry or was that a closing
(2:27:59) statement because it was sound like a diary entry but um yeah so I mean feminism is not beneficial to society i
(2:28:07) laid out uh my case why both historically and in terms of especially not in terms of scripture and divine
(2:28:13) revelation which he claims to agree with or believe in i mean Paul says to Timothy that women should not teach
(2:28:19) women should not be an authority in the church the church is a historically patriarchal institution we don't have
(2:28:25) women preachers women ministers and so women have a uh degree of rights or uh
(2:28:31) we could say their dignity is because they're made in the image of God just like men but that does not translate
(2:28:36) into equality of roles and of course the New Testament is abundantly clear about that as I said when Paul tells Timothy
(2:28:43) that women are not to preach or teach but should be uh in subjection and should be silent especially in the
(2:28:50) religious realm so um most of what she uh argued for today was her own
(2:28:55) subjective relativist positions that she wants that she thinks she thinks that is
(2:29:01) Jesus and exes Jesus back up this idea that because God is bigger than the idea of uh modern liberalism even though he's
(2:29:08) willed modern liberalism that that's what's good for society um she equivocated multiple times she quit she
(2:29:14) committed multiple fallacies throughout the discussion i never heard an exact clear argument as to why we ought to
(2:29:20) choose feminism she spent the first 45 minutes talking about how oughts are not relevant here because this was pragmatic
(2:29:26) no no i think if you know about debates debates are about making the argument from an epistemic justified true belief
(2:29:34) position that's what epistemology is it's concerned with justified true belief and I asked for that uh at least
(2:29:39) a couple times in the debate i never got that so I don't think that any of us heard any compelling arguments other
(2:29:45) than just GDP well GDP is not good enough to show us why we ought to have
(2:29:51) this position or this ideology unless GDP is somehow the highest good or the
(2:29:56) the best thing that we should shoot for so that's precisely why in the debate I kept asking for what her basis for the
(2:30:04) good is she didn't want to talk about that she said that was a meta discussion and it was a uh circular discussion and
(2:30:11) all these deflections away from the fact that everything that she argued for she based on a thing that was subjective
(2:30:18) that would make ultimately her arguments subjective and thus she lost the debate so uh I don't think we heard any
(2:30:24) convincing arguments for um feminism and in fact I think we heard that uh a
(2:30:29) better case for patriarchy from her own position because she claims to be a Christian and clearly feminism and
(2:30:36) Christianity are absolutely antithetical unless you think Paul was a postmodernist
(2:30:43) all right this is a picture of me and Jay being friends oh there you go it's
(2:30:48) very good there you go very talented thank you all right uh thank you both uh
