() 
(1:56) kylie you're going to go first go ahead okay thank you um hi my name is Kylie i
(2:02) just wanted to start by saying a little bit about what I stand for which is just feminism generally and I would want to
(2:08) say that feminism is a crucial movement both in the United States and across the world feminism is defined as advocating
(2:15) for gender equality and challenging the structures of power that perpetuate discrimination and violence against
(2:21) women it is not an attack on men rather it is a call for an equal and just
(2:27) society in the US despite progress women face systemic inequalities which means that
(2:34) gender inequality is rooted in many of the systems that we see today for instance women in the US earn 82 cents
(2:41) for every dollar that a man makes and black women earn just 63 cents so there
(2:46) are three reasons potentially that this could be the case which is I would say that we do not value female labor enough
(2:53) in this country and there's a phenomenon called male flight which is typically when a field becomes very female
(3:01) dominated 50 to 60% women men typically begin to leave that field and the pay rate for women drops so that might be
(3:07) some sort of implicit phenomenon happening as well as domestic labor is unpaid which is when women typically
(3:13) take on more of the child rearing in homes and obviously that is not something that is compensated and for
(3:20) women who do go to work and raise kids there's inadequate child support meaning
(3:25) they often miss out on we often miss out on promotions or other major um opportunities in the career because we
(3:31) are not supported in that way so this all could explain that economic inequality which brings me to according
(3:37) to the World Economic Forum it's going to take roughly 300 years to close the gender gap for both economic and
(3:43) political empowerment for women in countries like Afghanistan women still battle for access to education and
(3:50) health care as well as personal freedoms in some places if they open the door without being covered they may be beaten
(3:57) or arrested which brings me to this the home is the most dangerous place for women according to the United Nations
(4:03) the home the place where we should all feel safe six women are killed every hour around the world by people they
(4:11) know now here are some other very depressing statistics one in three women
(4:16) experience violence at the hands of a man in their lifetime whether that's physical or SA and that's according to
(4:22) the World Health Organization 50% of women who were unalived in 2017 were
(4:27) killed by an intimate partner violence it's according to the United Nations 650 million women were married before the
(4:34) age of 18 this is according to UNICEF meaning they became child brides often against their will now the final
(4:40) statistic is that 71% of human trafficking victims are women and girls this is not to negate the importance of
(4:47) male victims and standing up for their rights as well just to point out a general pattern in the fact that women are typically um overlooked as well as
(4:54) over represented in victim being victims of crimes now there's also a general tendency to
(4:59) blame women for our oppression that we make less because our work is less important or because we choose to work
(5:05) in fields that don't pay as much money or that we were essayed because of the clothes we were wearing or that we were
(5:10) unalived because we chose to marry the wrong man but none of these things are true and they are rooted in really
(5:16) harmful misconceptions about what the feminist movement stands for i'm sure you all are also expecting me to be very
(5:21) angry today and I hope that I won't be but I'm truly interested in furthering the feminist cause and promoting
(5:27) equality even if it means sometimes talking to people who don't agree with me um and finally I just would like to
(5:33) say that men can be feminists and they're very important for the feminist movement for seeking equal rights um
(5:39) around the world and um we strive to combat hate not promote it for equal
(5:45) rights for all and by definition feminism is about the belief in social economic and political equality of the
(5:52) sexes not about female supremacy or anything like that and I hope to debunk some of the myths that people think
(5:57) about feminists today and show that it is very important cause not just globally but in the US and in the West
(6:04) thank you all right Kylie thank you very much for your opening statement uh
() 
(6:10) Andrew if you'd like to give yours now yeah um just a second let me back up
(6:15) here one thing I wanted to address right in my opening i've been going through Kylie's videos and she knows so much which is
(6:23) not so this is a big bait and switch this happens often i think I pointed this out to the whatever podcast many
(6:30) times especially when it comes to sociology and psychology how often they are wrong and here's how they're wrong
(6:35) most often what they do is they take studies which are recently published they point to those data sets and say
(6:42) because this is right now the most current data set we have it's true and then operate as though those things are
(6:48) in reality true when they're not kinsey says for instance on gender quotas
(6:54) according to and she she cites this and many feminists site this are you talking about the the Kinsey study yeah yeah the
(7:03) Kinsey study which you cite right and most feminists site the Kinsey study um
(7:09) has been debunked for years i don't know where why why feminist Hang on it's my
(7:14) opening statement you'll have a chance to cross-examine him just allow him to let me let me walk you through this
(7:20) earlier this week journalist Christopher Brunette flagged a paper in a March 2024 issue of Econ Journal Watch a bannual
(7:27) publication edited by George Mason economist Daniel Klene that publishes articles lengths responses to other
(7:33) economist errors the paper written by accounting professor Jeremiah Green of Texas A&M and John RM Hand of the
(7:39) University of North Carolina addressed the first of three McKenzie four installment series of diversity studies
(7:45) green and Hand sought to test the replicability of McKenzie's findings guess what they found guys could another
(7:52) set of researchers using the same data come to the same conclusions since uh
(7:58) McKenzie refused to turn over its numbers Green and Hand had to reverse
(8:04) engineer the firm's 2015 18 and 20 data sets the results were startling green in
(8:09) hand couldn't replicate the results of McKenzie's first three studies which monitored the profitability of executive
(8:15) demographics of an undisclosed group of S&P 500 firms claiming to have found a positive correlation between diverse
(8:22) leadership and the firm's performance we do not find a statistical significant
(8:27) positive correlation between um McKenzie's measures of the racial
(8:33) ethnic diversity of executive terms of firms as measured in December 2019 green and hand reported and either the
(8:40) likelihood of financial outperformance in 1519 so to give you a quick summary the study seems to show it's most likely
(8:47) correlation and not causation meaning companies were already doing very financially well uh and they have the
(8:53) luxury to mess around with diversity quotas and initiatives in addition the data from the 2024 paper was unable to
(8:59) replicate any of the older McKenzie studies any of them that should uh tell you something
(9:06) so that's a very recent data set right why don't any of the psychologists ever
(9:13) go with the recent data set well the reason they don't go with it is because it doesn't affirm their nonsensical
(9:18) worldviews that's why they don't go with them ever you'll find this very common in sociology and in psychology which
(9:24) suffer from the replication crisis somewhere around 60% of their findings cannot be
(9:29) replicated are not to be trusted psychology is the study of the mind the scientific views of psychology are only
(9:36) done through data collection but it has to be interpreted this is a major major
(9:42) problem so many feminists will tell you so many studies and luckily I have all
(9:47) of the ones to refute all of all of my opponent's studies today because what
(9:53) happens is they have a biased worldview and they want the data set to correlate with the worldview rather than wanting
(10:00) to tell you what the actual truth is the truth is is that a bunch of S&P 500
(10:05) companies who are very rich were already doing really well and for the purposes of publicity they decided that they were
(10:11) going to start doing a bunch of DEI hires and ethnic hires and this type of thing and they decided that the
(10:18) correlation co they made it the correlation causation error that's it you'll find this over and over again I'm
(10:24) sure as we go through this debate as we go through the numbers especially when it comes to the abuse of women especially when it comes to just how
(10:30) useful women are we talk about domesticated labor labor what a joke you believe that women should be paid some
(10:37) type of domestic wage however it's skilled labor in the home which keeps the home running it's always going to be paid way more than domestic labor
(10:43) because it's more worthwhile than domestic labor simple so with that I'll finish my opening statement i can't wait
() 
(10:50) to dive right into this okay uh so Kylie it sounded like you
(10:56) maybe had some uh some push back you wanted to give on something Andrew said there yeah so I um
(11:04) very briefly referenced the McKenzie study and Mackenzie and company's women in the workplace study by the way is
(11:09) what he's referring to but um it's actually if you go and look it up it's generally considered accurate and comprehensive in its findings so I have
(11:15) quite literally no idea what my opponent is talking about as well as the fact that this is a red herring fallacy of
(11:20) just oh this is wrong and my opponent is wrong for the following reasons how's that a red herring because you're not
(11:25) actually acknowledging any of the information that I said i refuted the information i didn't even talk about that i have reputations to your video i
(11:33) have your video right here and you start by saying the largest comprehensive study the Kinsey study which one are you
(11:38) talking about i'll play it for you give me a second here okay well um I
(11:44) think we should stick to what we're talking about today um and I just Well we're talking about all of this today so
(11:50) the Okay well I would like you to be less hostile to me first of all because I think we should just have a general discussion stop whining we're doing a
(11:56) debate stop whining so um I'm not going to give you the reaction that I know you're looking for yeah so women are
(12:01) better leaders than most you agree oh yes yes yes yes i was looking at that video yeah there i mean that's like one of the ones that Can you cite which
(12:08) study you Oh yeah the one that I'm talking about now but I didn't reference that in my opening at all so I think the people in the audience if they had any
(12:13) sort of common sense following along they'd be like "What is he talking about kylie didn't mention that." Which I didn't but the thing is is like this is
(12:19) a a current core part of your worldview and belief and you make propaganda videos about it even though it's
(12:25) completely uninformed that women are better leaders i think that is a subjective opinion none of the statistics and facts that I gave
(12:30) previously are objective opinions like the fact that women didn't have the right to vote until 1920 women couldn't
(12:36) open a bank account in the United States till 197 when did men get the right to vote okay I know this exa is exactly what you
(12:42) were talking about this is what you're known for is like getting people on a technicality that we don't historically know but the answer to that is no the
(12:50) answer to that is The answer is that's no no the answer to that is the fact that in 1920 everyone was given the
(12:55) right to vote but there were still um barriers to vote for people of color when did men get the right to vote the
(13:00) the right to vote was guaranteed to all people in 1920 according to the 1920 yeah before 1920 were men were all men
(13:06) allowed to vote no okay great they weren't then when even when men supremacy and because our system was not
(13:11) founded equally are you aware that men only got any rights to vote about a decade roughly before women
(13:20) that is not true men have been making the founding fathers were all men so I have no idea what you're talking about what does it have to do with the right to vote the right to vote was
() 
(13:26) historically withheld from men of color it was a white also with the general population do not cut me off do not cut
(13:31) me off i'm in the middle of speaking i don't care if you're in the middle of speaking you're in the middle of a debate the right to to vote you don't
() 
(13:37) have your Tik Tok mute button sweetheart i will not be speaking anymore until you
(13:42) have a conversation with him well look if you can if we can uh for for both
(13:49) people if we can allow each other to finish uh even if you want to jump in
(13:54) just let the other person finish speaking if somebody's going on a uh monologue and they're filibustering I'll
() 
(14:01) try to get them to wrap up but just if they're making a point just try to let them finish no I did not go to school
(14:08) for 4 years and build a platform to be talked to like this so I will be walking away from the microphone right now and I
(14:14) would encourage you to get your guest under control i'm going to take two minutes so you can ask him questions if you'd like and I will be right back
(14:21) i just won't be back and I don't give a [ __ ] what do I care i'm here to have a
(14:27) debate and I listen to your whining do you want to have a debate or not all right i I'm not going to be talked to like this so do you want Do you want to
() 
(14:33) just take a little two-minute breather you want to take a two-minute breather this is feminism you're the strong woman
(14:39) you're the strong woman really strong woman i will not be talked
(14:46) to like what what did I even say um you know I would
(14:52) uh I will not be talked to like that yeah you will what are you talking about
(14:57) what are you It's a debate maybe we'll we we can try to stick to
(15:04) there's been some really strong feminist women in that chair who have debated with me just not this one yeah
(15:11) um although I think maybe for the the sake of the ensuring that the debate
(15:18) happens uh maybe we
(15:23) can just so we get the debate so the debate happens you know maybe Well what what am I supposed to do i'm in the
(15:30) middle of a debate am I supposed am I supposed to worry about tone policing and this and
(15:35) that because I have points and reputations which may hurt people's feelings well I I think she overreacted
(15:43) a little bit but I think it is fair to allow
(15:48) uh then if she's in the middle of uh time it give us 60 seconds a piece uh
(15:54) yeah we could do that yeah I'll I'll propose that to her just do 60 seconds but I mean I'm I'm fine with keeping it open but just if if you're talking I'll
(16:03) and she interrupts you I'll tell her not to mhm but if you can just try to let her uh finish yeah but when they when
(16:09) when anybody does the [ __ ] of like I'm speaking then you know what I mean of course there's going to be some Yeah
(16:14) but try to try to let her finish if you can but yeah let's do 60-second back and forth that's fine with me as long as
(16:19) there's some boundaries yeah you want to do that 60 seconds back and forth that works or if you guys want we could give
(16:25) it another shot at just keeping it open combo um sure why don't we do that if it
(16:31) if it the interruptions continue you guys feel like you're not I would like to just point out that Wait wait wait we
(16:36) have to set the rules first no more talking yes we will do 60 seconds supposed to be talked to like that though right no 60 seconds back and
(16:42) forth i Well I will leave i'm so serious we sign an agreement if I appear you can leave i don't care why do you think I
(16:48) care if you [ __ ] I'm not talking to you hold on i'm not talking to you i'm talking What's your What's Go ahead
(16:53) what's your proposal my proposal if we don't do 60 seconds back and forth I will walk out right now the agreement was that I appear it does not say that I
(16:59) have to stay for 3 hours so I will leave right now because I'm not going to be talked to like this i mean like what
(17:06) what real men a real You're going to tell me what a real man is well Andrew
() 
(17:11) real women don't abort their children lady my dad has the same political beliefs as you and he would never talk to a woman my sister has the same
(17:17) political beliefs as you and she would never dare talk to a man like that like what's your point that makes no sense andrew can you stop andrew that's really
(17:24) further oh god if everything's disrespectful andrew stop stop you're such a crybaby andrew stop in
(17:31) furtherance of ensuring that this debate actually occurs let's set some ground rules we
(17:38) got to allow people to finish their points and uh Andrew maybe you've said
(17:43) some mocking things towards her i have said no i have not mocked him at all no no no i have stood up for myself and I
(17:49) will not be mocked i have not said a word that is bad to you i talked to you about your family in Michigan i want to get to know you this isn't about
(17:55) anything about me mocking you this is a boundary of get to know you i'm here to do a debate look when you return to the
(18:02) table uh you did the the tone your tone wasn't the best towards Andrew and look
(18:08) look on hold on hold on i'll be fair hold on Kylie i'll be fair andrew's tone
(18:13) towards you wasn't great either in furtherance of ensuring that the debate actually occurs why don't we just get
(18:21) back to it and stick to the uh the substance of the conversation i'm trying
(18:27) to be fair to both of you but 60 seconds each yeah no interruptions andrew if you if you're fine with that then I'm fine
(18:33) with that so we'll and if you guys are open to it if if that goes well the 60 seconds each we can bring it back to
(18:39) open conversation well there does have to be some cross-examination at some point but yeah that's fine sure okay so
(18:45) Kylie go ahead you have uh 60 seconds okay so the point of my conversation here is I would genuinely like to have
(18:51) an open discussion about like what feminism means and to debunk some of the feminist myths but my opponent seems to
(18:57) want to attack me instead and call me names which is totally okay i'm used to that um especially if you look at my comments online but the point being I'm
(19:04) going to try my best to keep it very mellow again if I'm being attacked I am going to get defensive but I would like
() 
(19:09) to start by saying yes the Mackenzie study so in sociology psychology studies are flawed and that is true um they are
(19:15) continually it's a field that's expanding and that's why I chose to study psychology because I do find it so interesting but that doesn't negate the
(19:22) fact that plenty of studies have found a significant correlation between being a woman and being a victim of violence at
(19:27) the hands of a man and again the study of one in three women globally who experience sexual or physical violence
(19:32) and I think that is the core of what a lot of feminists believe in is trying to combat that violent behavior and to
(19:37) protect women i'm sure that's close to a minute so I can pass it over yeah so feminism has completely lied to
(19:44) everybody and I'll explain exactly how it failed in its promise its promise was that it was supposed to protect women it
(19:50) hasn't protected women the very idea that you want to put women inside of of male workforces is not protecting women
(19:57) the idea that you want to have dual colleges where it's men and women together is not protecting women these are terrible ideas and they've been
(20:03) borne out as being terrible ideas when you talk about sociological studies being flawed I don't think that you're
(20:10) really being honest about how flawed they are the replication crisis in sociology is getting worse not better
(20:16) it's not getting better even with all the meta analysis it's not getting better why isn't it getting better it's
(20:22) because of bias there's so much bias which is going on especially from the the purview of feminists and feminists
(20:29) use standpoint theory they want everything to go through the view of women so when you're talking about for instance the criteria when you're
(20:35) talking about uh what that means that women are assaulted right what what is
(20:41) the criteria for that for what an assault actually is that's a really good question um it it there are definitely
(20:48) we are definitely working on um defining the lines for that so right now there's an acronym that we are coming up with that we want to teach in schools of like
(20:55) what that means which is um fry so freely given reversible informed enthusiastic or engaged in specific of
(21:02) what consent means so that there is no confusion about what is happening in
(21:08) terms of you know like whether it's an assault because I know that does happen where men are confused and they don't
(21:13) know and especially if there's alcohol involved and so my goal is to protect women and also to make sure that men
(21:20) know that if they are causing harm that I mean a lot of men they don't want to hurt other people they don't realize it
(21:25) and so I think if we have better education about like what assault is and how to prevent it because again there
(21:31) are male victims so I think if it's something that we can come forward about and make sure that everyone feels heard
(21:36) and supported then men would also come forward more about like if they've been assaulted this doesn't answer my
(21:42) question though my question is when you cite the data on how many of these women have actually been assaulted what is the
(21:48) criteria being used um that's a good question i see your point of how it varies like based upon the study and
(21:54) things like that but um I think uh a lot of these problem is that it is self-reported but again another issue is
(22:00) that that means they could be under reportported as well because you know women are too scared to report it um so
(22:06) yes there are issues with that um but another thing though is that women are definitely in a position um in the home
(22:11) where they are not safe in a lot of places and again that comes back to the um kind of assumption that I was talking
(22:18) about earlier is that like it's because we married the wrong man and you know this guy is unsafe in our home but it's not about that sometimes when you you
(22:24) marry somebody or you date somebody they can then become violent towards you um because they see you as their property
() 
(22:30) almost most of these domestic violence claims and things like this are happening from single mothers with boyfriends though not happening from the
(22:36) father at home relationships yes I do okay no I I'm just wondering because um
(22:41) yeah not only not only is that factually the case but interestingly enough if the
(22:47) state seizes custody of a child inside of an abusive home the child's actually more likely at the hands of the state to
(22:53) die than they are in the hands of the abusive home which is insane but true I
(22:59) think now let me give you the studies that you're talking about here okay um I So okay are are these the studies about
(23:06) which claims that you said yeah so here we're going to start with the national incident study NIS it's the largest
(23:13) collection of all types reporting data relating to abuse and m malreatment of children okay 68% of malreated children
(23:20) were maltreated by a female whereas 48% were maltreated by a male some children
(23:26) were maltreated by both of children maltreated by biological parents mothers maltreated the majority 75% were fathers
(23:32) maltreated a sizable majority 43% in contrast male perpetrators were more common for children maltreated by
(23:38) non-biological parents or parents partners 64% or 75% safest place you can
(23:44) possibly be in the home is with your husband and with your children that that's for women the safest place they
(23:50) can be any study that you pull up is going to be drawing from the NIS source
(23:55) that's direct from the NIS itself there's no refuting that i've looked and looked and looked it is definitely from
(24:02) partner incident violence women are the safest when they have a husband in the home i think for some women that is the
(24:08) case i think there are good men out there and I think that's a misconception that feminists don't believe in and that
(24:13) there are good men that we hate all men which definitely isn't true but I would like to say like because you're saying you know psychology is an evolving field
(24:19) there are different studies and different numbers male perpetrators are predominant and while the exact percentage differs it's generally
(24:25) estimated that between 75 and 90% of child sexual abuse is committed by men or male adolescence nope that's because
(24:30) it's not drawing from the correct data set which would be the NIS but the and the reason they do have the authority to
(24:36) say which one is the correct data set because they all draw from the NIS all of them draw from this data set the NIS
(24:42) they have to it's the most comprehensive source for reporting so here's what happens if you wanted to gather data
(24:47) you're a psychologist are you seriously explaining to me how it works to gather data no I'm asking you a question if you
(24:53) wanted to gather data right if you want especially on crimes you would use law enforcement or the best source for
(25:00) reporting right in this case self-reporting is going to be far less reliable than reports to the police
(25:05) things like this right yes understandable so you're saying that this is the most comprehensive therefore the most reliable source it's the most
(25:11) comprehensive source where are you finding that it is the most comprehensive because you haven't mentioned a source that says it is because I'm looking at it now the NIS
(25:18) that's not from the NIS there's the National It's from the NIS from the NIS there's the National Center
(25:24) of for Victims of Crime in RAIN which is the statistics that I just draws from the NIS okay so then how come it draws
(25:31) from the same source my conclusion is different than yours because they changed the criteria for what is considered assault and they change the
(25:37) criteria like I've seen it as bad as them saying that men cannot be essayed by women because it's non-penetrative i
(25:44) see so you're saying that those that would skew the numbers it does skew the numbers so the results of the national incident study NIS the largest
(25:52) collection of all types of reported data related to abuse the malreatment 68% of maltreated uh children were maltreated
(25:58) by a female 48% maltreated by a male women when they're in positions of power
(26:05) over the over people who are weaker than them actually abuse more than men do so
(26:10) at the same time while you say well women have to run this big gambit of threats from men because men are much
(26:16) stronger than women and more have more propensity of violence when women are in charge of people who are inferior in
(26:21) strength to them they're incidences of violence towards them are much higher than men's incidences of violence
(26:27) towards them it sounds like women are the greater threat here than men sure um if you want to say that that's totally
(26:33) your prerogative but that's not what the numbers say so you can say what no no no it's my turn to speak you can say what you want about all the different
(26:39) statistics and how they come from a specific study but the point is that they are there are different estimates
(26:44) and basically every study conducted globally has found that the number of female victims is astronomically higher
(26:50) than male victims not to say male victims aren't important if you are a male victim especially if you haven't spoken up I have seen the effects of
(26:55) having male sexual assault in my family so please like talk to somebody it is serious but one in six boys have been
(27:01) sexually assaulted and a lot of the time it is by male offenders but what about the fact that when we're talking about
(27:06) wages of abuse of children women are are the ones who are most often in charge of
(27:12) children the domestic rates for instance inside of a boy's home where the guards
(27:18) prison guards are all male and it's a male uh you know youth population versus
(27:24) female if there's a female you uh females in charge of the youth population the statistics for abuse
(27:30) skyrocket same thing inside of public schools are you saying that women are more likely to be uh women are more
(27:35) likely no women are more likely than men when it comes to the weaker sex in this case children we would just say children
(27:42) are the the uh I not I mean both sexes right but they're they're the weaker
(27:47) human than women when they're in charge of children they actually abuse them far more than what men abuse women at and so
(27:55) it's like so who's really the dangerous ones here your 60 seconds begins go ahead you're good thank you um well I
(28:02) would like to say that that is a a claim that that is a reasonable conclusion that you are drawing from the data that
(28:08) you are presenting unfortunately that that is not true though that the vast majorities of sex offenders are male and
(28:13) especially when you know there are still female offenders and that is still bad but um the point is that there is
(28:21) significant male dominance and that most sex offenders are male and females do commit sex crimes but they're often
(28:26) under represented as perpetrators so you're correct um but the data you're reporting is it do you want to continue
(28:32) yes please um and so you're 60 this is from the United States Commission sentencing which is just about sexual
(28:38) abuse offenders um and there's a whole pie chart here but in like about how many times they offend and who they
(28:44) offend and um who they're under guidance for and again it is saying that the vast
(28:50) majority up to 80% of the perpetrators um are men yeah yeah you can talk now so women do you agree with me that well I
(28:57) have to ask some questions here so I can figure some things out i hope that you'll answer them so do you agree with
(29:02) me that uh both men and women have the propensity to in some way essay the
(29:08) other the other partner both of them yeah I wouldn't say that it's I mean no yes I agree it is definitely possible
(29:14) for both sexes to do that the question becomes if you have if you switch criteria around right for what is
(29:20) considered sexual assault let's just assume things like cat calling are put in the category that's harassment but
(29:26) are you saying it's categorized not as harassment but as a form of sexual abuse
(29:32) would you say that that would greatly skew the numbers if that were how it was classified yes do you have evidence that
(29:38) is how it is i do in fact there's there's a whole grouping of colleges in a study that I can show you where that
(29:43) was smuggled in as a form of uh of sexual assault or essay or sexual
(29:49) battery in some cases right they smuggle in but and so what they do is they
(29:55) decide that they want to make that data set wider and so they just reclassify things which would not ordinarily be
(30:01) classified as sexual assault or sexual battery by just inserting those things now the same same exact thing happens
(30:07) here do you think that it's very masculine for instance inside of society for men to go and report when a woman
(30:12) gives them unwanted touching no and I I matter of fact I do know male victims with female perpetations and they have
(30:18) unwanted touching yes so they're just far more likely to report it because of the social stigma which happens to them
(30:24) often from women who tell them things like "I don't consider you a real man." Like you did to me earlier oh um I
(30:30) didn't really say that but you did your exact words were "A real man would X." Oh yeah like real men like my dad who
(30:37) have the same political beliefs but don't talk to women the way you do yeah whatever that means but anyway so a real man a real man does X right wouldn't you
(30:43) say that the social stigma around the fact that women can kind of get away with the same type of inappropriate
(30:49) touching without men reporting would greatly skew these numbers yes however I think that women um and men who are
(30:55) victims and are perpetrators as well I think those are both under reportported i think across the board it's under reportported but more for male victims
(31:02) with female perpetrators how many more for male victims i don't know but it could be it could be drastic right and I
(31:07) would hope not and if it is drastic then it would skew your numbers on all of those percentages across the board absolutely it would but the problem is
(31:13) we have no way of gathering that data and with the data we do have though I see what you're saying about the stigma but it is so vastly that women are
(31:20) victims and men are the perpetrators that I don't see that catching up in any percentage why not it it depends on how
(31:26) underreported it is in fact a lot of these data sets draw from unreported incidences via estimates don't they
(31:33) unreported incidences via estimates yes so I suppose yeah there's no way that they can actually gather that data um
(31:43) yeah so this would be the exact same thing right they're making a supposition based on an estimate this would equally
(31:49) have to apply to men but if the social stigma is there by your own admission that men are basically not reporting the
(31:55) instances of unwanted touching from women due to this social stigma we don't actually know how bad that social stigma
() 
(32:01) really is do we no and I mean that's also what feminists that's a great point and I agree with you because feminists
(32:07) that is one of Oh it's also my 60 seconds right well we're having a back and forth now so okay well can I have 60 seconds cuz I would just like to talk a
(32:13) little bit about like we can't like we can't get into a back and forth and then and then like arbitrarily demand whole
(32:19) blocks well I'm just going to give some statistics cuz I think we're on the same page here i think we've actually found common ground so the the stigma around
(32:25) um essay and abuse is what allows these numbers to be under reportported and so I think that because that's what
(32:31) feminists want is we want men to be comfortable coming forward as well because we want safety and equality for the sexes that is what the definition of
(32:37) the term is is the belief in social economic and political equality of the sex let me refute these lies because well I think that some people don't
(32:42) believe that all all national campaigns that I've seen hyperfocus on women and the abuse of women already making this
(32:48) supposition that men are the monsters and the criminals who are doing the unwanted touching and the essaying and
(32:53) because of that because this is done at a national level at a state level at a local level and the organizations and
(32:58) NOS's are all hyperfocusing on women this stigma towards men is never addressed because women are only looking
(33:05) at it through the prism of women you know it's not just women who are working on these studies right and who are writing these articles it doesn't matter
(33:11) don't you say men can be feminists yeah okay so by your criteria these men who have the same exact worldview as you
(33:16) they're still hyperfocusing on feminism and the idea always starts with the supposition that men are the more
(33:23) violent sex that there are more often doing these types of of essay sexual assaults things like this and what do we
(33:29) end up with we end up with very skewed numbers based on the criteria right where uh within just a matter of minutes
(33:36) we can determine that not only can most of this stuff be replicated but we can also determine that just based on the viewed categorization of these things
(33:43) they can't be true these numbers can't be true okay no um so I don't understand
(33:49) where you're coming from with how it can't be true how something can't be true because again if you're going off of something being under reportported and the data not being there you're
(33:55) saying okay well then this is true which means this can't be true which means this and you're not even going from like actual data you want me to demonstrate
(34:00) it no no I'm okay I'm talking for now please um I'll demonstrate it real quick so it would be like this you know what
(34:05) i'm I'm actually okay i feel like you've dominated the conversation for the last few minutes if that's okay if I would like to Well I thought you just wanted
(34:11) me to demonstrate for you something no no I'm actually okay on that thank you you don't you don't want me to you asked me a question you don't want me to
(34:17) answer it no no no i was actually in the middle of talking okay go ahead um thank you um so you're welcome thank you no
() 
(34:23) like that was genuine i wasn't trying to be I know you're welcome thanks uh yeah so um the patriarchy is benevolent yes
(34:29) so I think that the four principles that uh is it's a common misconception and if you want to refute these like I would
(34:36) love that but working to increase equality economically and politically for for women um which again not rooted
(34:42) in female supremacy but some people think it is uh expanding human choice human choice meaning male female
(34:48) everyone um elim eliminating gender stratification which means you know globally it's hang can we move back to two yes expanding human choice um and
(34:57) for everybody and And then three eliminating gender stratification um you
(35:03) know how like most of the power and money is concentrated to men globally so sort of making the opportunities there
(35:10) for women and again like you have to think about this globally as well like not it's not we're very US- ccentric I think in this debate but there are
(35:16) definitely countries where women are really really uh deprived of any sort of autonomy and then the final one is
(35:23) ending sexual violence which we've talked about quite a lot so those are the four principles of feminism as we see it today um and although there are
(35:31) different places around the world I guess we can focus um you know sort of here and globally if you have points on
(35:37) that or if you just want to confine it to the US then let me know yeah well the US is where I live that's where I'm
(35:43) talking about but okay so when we're discussing this this idea especially of
(35:48) no no these numbers are accurate that actually can't be true you said no it it actually can't be well no it can't be
(35:54) because one you've already admitted that there's a stigma towards reporting which means that these numbers are already skewed right from the get-go here's a
(36:00) good demonstration of this this is something you'll hear psychologists say a lot and I'm sure you probably said it yourself that mental illness probably
(36:07) has always been somewhat near as high as it is right now it's just that it went under reportported right that's
(36:12) something that you would say or trans there's just as many transgender people now as there were or homosexuals it's just that we didn't have the right
(36:19) numbers cuz they weren't able to report them correctly right so it follows then that if it is the case that under all of
(36:24) these circumstances due to a lack of reporting due to stigma we didn't have the correct numbers and so you can
(36:30) suppose that into the data that you have right now for how many there's always been why couldn't I do the exact same
(36:35) thing with SA numbers no you can but um how are you going to get the fig like how are you going to get the figure that
(36:40) it is more are you saying it's more female perpetrators like than male perpetrator how could you possibly get
(36:46) that number because if I look at the raw data and we look at stigmas right if we're looking we agree on stigma but the
(36:51) data how do you have because the data is not taking into account the stigma towards male reporting but it is but I'm
(36:56) saying there are no reporting cases yeah how do you how do you report the cases if the stigma is there for them to not
(37:02) report so yes given that how do we come up with any because you know these other places
(37:08) they come up with estimates studies that you just cited so how do we come up with an estimate for female whether we come up with the estimate or not we have good
(37:14) reason to doubt the the uh the various estimates by RAIN and these other sexual
(37:19) advocacy organizations especially when I look at the NIS because when I look at the NIS I get totally different numbers
(37:24) and it's way more comprehensive it's the largest most comprehensive data set on planet earth is the NIS and that's what
(37:31) it shows it shows that women are far more likely to abuse their children than men when when women are in positions of
(37:38) dominant power and authority over weaker people than themselves they're more likely to abuse almost every time this
() 
(37:43) is also included in healthc care stats when they are in charge of people who are weaker than them in healthcare
(37:49) situations they abuse far more than men do you keep talking about the NIS like which specific like are you talking
(37:55) about the national in because what the specific study that you're talking about how women are perpetrators more frequently genuinely cannot find it
(38:00) anywhere on the internet okay I'll pull up the exact study if you give me just a second yeah no that's fine um because I'm looking at like the Bureau of
(38:05) Justice statistics and like you know like the FBI from the US even the CDC find this
(38:11) from the US Department of Justice sexual victimization and juvenile facilities reported by youth 2012 okay okay and is
(38:18) this where you're saying that these are all comprehensive these are all comprehensively included inside of the
(38:23) NIS this is why I'm saying is that I have each individual study ready for you the you can look also and we can we can
(38:30) move to this as well if you want to wait so is this the one where you're saying that female perpetrators are more frequent is that what you're talking
(38:36) about yes yes from the that's from the national incident study oh national
(38:41) incident study yes okay the largest collection of all types reported data related to abuse malreatment of children
(38:46) 68% of the maltreated children were maltreated by a female 48% maltreated by a male in every circumstance the NIS
(38:53) finds that when women are put in charge of uh people who are weaker than
(38:59) themselves are more likely to abuse than the stronger sex that being men and what's interesting about this is it
(39:05) gives us every reason to believe that if women had the exact same frame and build as men did that men that uh that they
(39:13) would actually abuse far more often than men do them right so what we're looking
(39:18) at here is we're looking at a huge problem where women who are supposedly being abused by men are doing a whole
(39:25) lot of abuse which is going unreported of children while you're focusing on the scapegoat of men yeah i don't doubt that
(39:31) women are unfortunately a lot of women are abusing children but the study that you're saying the only thing that I'm
(39:36) able to find is that one in every 25 children in the US experience malreatment neglect is more prevalent than abuse and then they talk about how
(39:42) for the 4% of children that experience genuine maltreatment and and danger of of death but I I'm not seeing anything
(39:49) um it says "Oh girls were sexually abused much more often than boys under the harm standard and endangerment
(39:54) standard with male perpetrators being more common." That's all I was able to find um uh Okay would you like for me to
(39:59) actually link it to you that was just from the juvenile facility study though right yeah yeah but what about the NIS
(40:05) data the NIS data is going to be the most important because it's the most comprehensive collection of it it's
(40:10) funny because you keep repeating this talking point about a study that I can't find uh well how do you I'm not saying it doesn't exist but from the So you
(40:18) think that um the National Incident Study is not reporting this like I could link I can link it to you no I I believe
(40:24) it i'm just saying like there are so many more common sources that have different numbers talking about how male
(40:29) perpetrators are more common than the study that you're talking about because I genuinely I'll I got a little more for
(40:35) you the US Department to me is that Yeah the US Department of Health and Human Services has been tracking the data on
(40:40) child abuse and neglect since 1978 with something called the National Incident Study NIS the National Incident Study is
(40:46) a congressionallymandated periodic effort of the United States Department of Health and Human Services there have
(40:51) been four such reports the latest being the NIS-4 which came out 2010 this includes the breakdown the NIS gathers
(40:57) data from all reporting agencies that and any study will pull from these agencies because it's the congressional
(41:04) authority which is gathering that data the methodology the NIS uses the standard definitional framework for
(41:09) classifying child maltreatment including both types of abuse and neglect these are the legitimate numbers and feminists
(41:15) have been hiding them under a rock because they don't want to talk about this issue um I I I think that that is
(41:22) an interesting theory i think that a lot of the things that you're talking about go more into theory than into fact and
(41:28) that's okay i think that goes into what I'm saying is like just generally that's why I'm here is to debunk a lot of the myths um why you didn't debunk that myth
(41:36) well again you said you would send me the study cannot find the study that women are more likely to be perpetrators
(41:41) it doesn't I I genuinely cannot find a single thing i've been looking for 5 10 minutes you've been looking for what have you been looking on i've literally
(41:48) looked at exactly what you said cannot find the numbers because I like I'm not This is not trying to be like an appeal
(41:53) to like authority but I've done like debate my whole life and like obviously like most of the time we tend to focus on the facts so to me if I can't
(41:59) understand the facts I they don't exist of where I'm finding it that is a problem for me
(42:05) okay i I saw that it didn't say the numbers that you were talking about yes it has them this is from There's no way
(42:10) you scroll down so I can read it how in the world i was just on that website and they did not say that female perpetrators are more common did you
(42:15) read that entire thing in 2 minutes that is nonsense it is huge there is no
(42:22) possible way you went through those numbers i read like that is the biggest book that is the biggest c there is no
(42:28) possible way you went through that in 2 minutes it is massive okay you can think that it's okay what do you mean think
(42:33) that that is not humanly possible do you have magic powers that I'mware unaware of i don't know you're pretty smart what
(42:42) oh come on at least be honest in the debate i mean there's you could just say I didn't read it you I couldn't find the
(42:48) numbers that you're citing there's no possible way that exist the numbers that you're talking about there they don't
(42:53) exist female perpetrators are not more common than male perpetrators so like again I would prefer that we would stick
(42:59) to actual reality and facts that these are the actual realities and facts I just showed you the study right the most
() 
(43:05) likely reason why women are more likely to abuse than men other than the fact they're not being used to checked on uh
(43:10) using force is the UK's leading mental health charity the mental health foundation says that today women are
(43:16) three times more likely than men to experience common mental health problems as well do you want to go over that about how men are more likely to
(43:22) experience mental health issues no females women are more likely to experience mental health issues what is
(43:27) your point yes than men what's your point well how is feminism combating this i would hope that we can continue to do a better job i mean there's a lot
(43:34) of people that I know that really struggle with their mental health and a lot of I mean we don't have to get too deep into it but I know that a lot of
(43:40) women who have experienced some uh abuse uh sexually at the hands of a man and then that led them to have mental health
(43:46) issues i also know men more than sold PTSD no no no no ptsd is certainly an issue but you can get PTSD from a number
(43:52) of things so I I would like to point out that like just saying one thing doesn't negate the other right so like just because I think it's important to talk
(43:58) about women's mental health doesn't mean men's mental health isn't important because again they are more likely to like you know what about the fact that
(44:04) women's women's mental health has been astronomically growing in the negative direction under feminism especially
(44:09) under the egalitarianism of gender they report they report the h the happiest
() 
(44:14) levels that women report are when they're married and in traditional gender roles have you ever heard of the term ignorant the phrase ignorance is
(44:20) bliss i'm sorry do I want to I'm sorry do I need to go and experience killing someone right to know that I don't want
(44:26) to experience killing someone what well ignorance is bliss it's possible
(44:31) for instance that I could kill someone and really love it right to maybe talk about Well hang on i want you to answer
(44:36) my question is that possible i just don't really understand how can you answer my question though if is it
(44:41) possible that I could kill somebody and then just really like it but how does that answer my question please stop
(44:48) negating the question just answer the question i just don't really want to talk about murder i don't care what you want to talk i want you to answer my question and I'll answer yours i'm not
(44:54) answering your question just go to your You're not going to answer my question about murder that's not related to business yes it's a Listen it's
(45:00) logically answer how you think I would answer answer how you answer what do you mean i'm in a debate with you i'm not in
(45:06) a debate with me i'm not Why would I answer this hypothetical question about murder that has nothing to do with I was talking about If it has nothing to do
(45:12) with it I'm going to look really stupid right so just answer the question so um go ahead and finish because I would like
(45:19) So my question to you was isn't it possible that I could kill someone who really like
(45:24) it that would be yes or no i understand how this works but I need you to answer my questions we're in a
(45:30) debate i will answer your questions but you also need to answer mine or I can't get to the worldview yes or no okay i
(45:37) just This seems like a really moot point to me and it Can you just answer it then you've wasted like like two minutes not
(45:43) answering the question it's like a three-hour debate yeah why are you wasting time just answer the question
(45:49) look Kylie it's it's conceivable that you're going to propose hypothetical questions to Andrew to test and I'll
(45:55) answer them logic and worldview he'll answer it he's I think it's a fair question if you can answer it as the
(46:00) moderator sure um I suppose it is possible yes that if you did it then you would enjoy it although it makes me
(46:06) uncomfortable to talk about that okay but if that's if this is the Well it would be possible for any human being
(46:12) yeah logically possible so the thing is is that knowing that this is true that we could I am actually ignorant having
(46:18) never killed anybody right and I am in bliss about that i myself am really
(46:24) really happy that I've never done that even though I could do that and be very happy about that the idea that you would
(46:30) make the point ignorance is bliss seems to in I just want to give you I'll give you
() 
(46:36) the the quick answer i have to wait for you to let me talk thank you you're welcome so what I would say is this when
(46:42) you say ignorance is bliss all you're doing is alluding to the fact that people should engage in I'm giving you 15 seconds if you don't give me Mike I'm
(46:49) leaving go ahead 15 oh my god you're going to leave oh no uhoh look Andrew's
(46:55) finishing his point i was He was finishing his point no I'm serious 10 15 seconds because he's been talking for
(47:01) the last 5 minutes so it's really not fair you're You're not moderating very well here well to be fair you guys got
(47:07) to allow We were actually doing really well I think hold on hold on until I was until I was making a broader point then
(47:13) then I that wasn't well it was at the expense of me speaking is the problem hold on just one moment so look in in
(47:19) conversations and especially in a debate look sometimes people are going to are going to butt in there's been a few
(47:24) times you've done it Andrew's done it you've both done it i'm trying my best here well that's why I'm alerting you i
(47:30) feel like at this point I would like to be able to speak my point because he he inter he rebuted me before I was able to
(47:36) give my point and that's that's been happening the last time you asked me a question have you heard the term ignorance is bliss so I could speak and
(47:42) explain my point yeah so then I said yes and said but we here's the problem talk for about 3 4 minutes and then try to
(47:47) back me into corner the expression when I ask you a question you answer it I expect a yes or no and then you give a
(47:52) comprehensive answer like I was so can I can I give my my explanation
(47:59) did you are you done Andrew okay okay so um you you going back like 5 minutes basically to what we mentioned was the
(48:06) term like oh women are happier in the home with a husband and kids right and so the term of ignorance is bliss I think for a lot of women who do not have
(48:13) the opportunity to get an education and they are forced to be in the home they don't know any other alternative so some
(48:18) women are truly happy but if that becomes the standard that women have to be in the home and have kids and they
(48:23) don't have the opportunity to get an education then of course that's going to be something that they think brings them joy because they don't have any other
(48:29) opportunities and so like there's a lot of people in my mom's generation or my grandma's generation where like they
(48:34) were like "Man I wish I could have gone to school and like had an education and like picked someone and they just fell into a marriage that either was abusive
(48:41) or like they weren't happy." And so I think that um it's easier to report higher levels of happiness when you
(48:47) perceive it to be your own your only option is living in the home and having children and raising them so but what do
(48:53) you have to say to that yeah so interestingly because it goes to your like underreported things like well first of all when when you give
(48:58) anecdotal evidence like oh my mom and mom's friends I can give you an actual study if you want may have and I can
(49:04) refute it I promise but here's the thing when you give anecdotal evidence and you say well my mom's friends this and that
(49:09) wish that they could have gone to school there's also anecdotal evidence and an awful lot of it and you can find it on YouTube right now of tons of women
(49:15) saying they wish that they had not gone and gotten a career and wish that they would have instead deferred those
(49:21) childbearing years in order to have a family because they see the happiness levels of their friends colleagues f you
(49:27) know co-workers things like this that anecdotally is also just as true but to
(49:32) even go on to the ignorance is bliss i could say this and make this case about literally anything i could say well I
(49:37) would love heroin right i've never taken it but ignorance is bliss right oh I could say ignorance is bliss about
(49:44) literally anything any drug hang on any risky I didn't cut you off any risky
(49:49) behavior any of this i could say that about anything what you're doing is saying I'm these women are happy there
(49:55) must be some bad reason for that some women are happy no you're saying these women are happy and there must be a bad
(50:01) reason for that and the bad because they're doing traditional Hang on because they're doing traditional gender roles so that must be bad so we can
(50:07) explain that away by saying if they had all these negative experiences that those women who have those negative
(50:12) experiences actually report a higher unhappiness level those women would actually be happier that's absurd logic
() 
(50:17) by the way okay sure um well again I agreed with you on quite a few things there but I would also like to say that like I said at the beginning in my
(50:23) opening statement the home being the most dangerous place for women like there are women who are in abusive marriages and so they have to convince
(50:29) themselves that they are happy because their husband is beating them or like assaulting them or harming their
(50:35) children and um when you're in that sort of situation it's very difficult to be able to walk away from it and often
(50:41) times because you're isolated um and so yeah because the home is the most dangerous place for women and you know
(50:46) six women are killed every hour in the home um around the world those are very difficult realities that a lot of people
(50:52) don't want to grasp and I'm not saying that every woman doesn't you know isn't happy in the home i think there are
(50:57) plenty of happy moms i mean my mom has worked and raised our children you know her children and my sisters and I and
(51:03) like helped my dad out with like work but yeah for the most part was a stay at home mom and I think she really enjoyed it but for me at this point in my life
(51:09) that's not something that I would like and it's not to say that it's you know it's a bad thing but I just I think that
(51:15) some people are um convincing themselves that they're happy when in reality it's a very uh difficult situation well I'm
(51:22) going to have to go back to the NIS where I point out to you that as you keep saying that the most dangerous
(51:27) situation for women is in the home well that's according to the UN around the world though not just here okay but inside of the United States at least and
(51:33) inside of the Western nations this is a commonality that they all share it's not usually from the husband it's usually
(51:39) from boyfriends of single women or single moms or uh as far as for instance
(51:46) cohabitation cohabitation leads to some of the worst outcomes for women when they're not married and men it leads to
(51:53) terrible outcomes for both this idea that you have that some when you when you say this it's very loaded it gives
(51:59) the impression that husbands are at home abusing their wives and the opposite is actually true the truth is is that when
(52:05) women get divorced and they end up in these occupied relationships that's when they end up with the most amount of
(52:10) abuse not from their husbands well I think it's uh you know how we were talking about earlier about like confounding factors and other things
(52:16) that might uh the classification of things might change the results of studies for this one um I'm looking
(52:21) about it looking at it and it says facts and statistics on you know domestic violence DV and it's mainly um including
(52:28) partner intimate partner so it's it's not talking about husband or boyfriend that's why we separate them right so we would separate those two categories to
(52:34) see who's the more abusive do you have a statistic yes I just gave it to you twice from the NIS i know but like I I'm
(52:39) looking at it and again like I'm having Show me the numbers from the NIS that you're looking at i actually don't believe you oh I'm not looking at the
(52:44) NIS right now i was looking at it earlier could not find the number you were talking about yeah but you looked at it from one minute no I didn't you
(52:51) did those I I literally pulled it direct from the NIS itself when there is a
(52:56) minor in the home and there is abuse they look at both parents and in that
(53:01) case they are finding according to this the domestic violence center data for
(53:07) mankind initiative i'm finding the mankind initiative the cult the cult the
(53:12) mankind initiative i I have no idea what you're I mean this is like a it's a statistic like it's like um a study
(53:18) that's produced or I could go to the University of Pennsylvania do that because the Mankind Initiative as far as I know is a western cult which exists as
(53:27) a deasculating agency just so you know um I okay uh well so it's saying
(53:34) analyzing 31,000 this is pen today um so this does uh go to your to your point it
(53:39) is just slightly above the spouse rate for abusive boyfriends um but again um
(53:46) and those go reported much more right than or I'm sorry the marriage rates go
(53:51) reported much more than the inter than these rates where you're living outside
(53:57) of the home with another man right so because that's the more common living arrangement therefore I am correct it is
(54:04) true that the most dangerous situations coccupancy not marriage i mean there's different I think it's difficult you you
(54:10) deal a lot in absolutes and as a teacher that's something that we are told not to do to facilitate like open communication
(54:16) is because you typically say well this is true this is true that means I am truth I am correct in saying this thing
(54:22) but again statistics are changing all the time so actually you're contradicting yourself because at the beginning you were like what I'm saying
(54:27) is I can negate I can negate these with logic by simply pointing pointing this
(54:32) out I mean you can negate anything when you talk to yourself like you do because you're not really listening to the words that are coming out of my mouth I'm
(54:37) listening to do you want me to steal me in your position you just said to me that everything everything when it comes to statistics is fluid i would tend to
(54:44) agree with that based on data which is coming in however we still have to apply
(54:50) logic and inductive reasoning even when we're dealing with data sets especially i didn't say we don't I agree so those
(54:56) are unchanging unconfounding variables logic and reason so if we're using those two things we can easily point to this
(55:03) and say we know for sure that it's going to be under reportported in cohabitation and possibly uh reported at least better
(55:11) from the marriage standpoint that's probably that's probably true i don't think anybody would really dispute that
(55:17) yeah actually I found a study to your point researchers have consistently found higher rates of violence in cohabitating compared to marital
(55:22) relationships but in those cases still it is 95% of perpetrators are male so what do you have to say in terms of that yeah okay so here's what happens what
(55:30) feminism has done especially with the destruction of the marriage is it has put women in the most vulnerable
(55:36) position where now they leave their home with their husband where they're the abuse rates are not nearly so high as
(55:42) pretentious feminists pretend they are so that they can cohabitate with men with other men who are strangers to them
(55:49) strangers to their children it puts their children at risk and it puts them at actually higher risk than if they had
(55:54) stayed with their husbands in most cases oh okay that makes sense as an explanation but I think that um like
(56:00) again that's an anecdote that's probably not true for everybody um and the the cases are are pretty clearly in place
(56:06) like the the evidence has shown that regardless of whether there's children in the marriage 95% of the perpetrators
(56:13) are men and you know we were talking about how it is likely under reportported for female perpetrators
(56:18) right in marriages i'm sure there are abusive wives but I think that the point being is that it is very um it is
(56:24) definitely a pattern in terms of in the United States of the home being made
(56:29) unsafe because of uh men that live there it doesn't have to be the husband but it is uh men that are um you know being
(56:37) violent with the women that they are living with and I think your point about how it's it's women that are picking these boyfriends that are abusing them
(56:43) is not uh fair because again you don't know men that are going to be to turn out to be abusive until they hit you one
(56:49) day it doesn't start out with you know if you went on a first date with a woman and she clocked you in the face would you continue to date her no you wouldn't
(56:54) it's the same with women here's what we're going to do andrew Andrew you give your response then we're going to do a prompt change okay okay so I don't I
(57:01) Okay but yeah that was the end of my I don't even understand this like all of the stats back up exactly what I'm saying you agree with me that what I'm
(57:08) saying is likely the most true case scenario at least compared to all the numbers boyfriends being more abusive
(57:14) yeah can can I finish right i didn't cut you off so the thing is is like look as
(57:19) we look at this data the data backs up everything that I just said especially when it comes to cohabitation you say
(57:25) well it's not women's responsibility that they're picking these men it's like well women are initiating most of these divorces for one they're leaving their
(57:32) husbands they put themselves in this confounding situation where now they're being abused by strange men often
(57:38) because they want them as sexual partners or other things like this you say "Well that's the true that the abuse happens inside of these places male
(57:44) whether there's children or not." Great but when it's a cohabitation event where children are involved you're now putting
(57:51) your children at risk because the the risk skyrockets for abuse skyrockets for
(57:56) abuse of those children no wonder men don't want to get married to modern women if they're going to get divorced
(58:02) and their women are going to put their children in an abusive situation right and that's what the stats show more than
(58:09) anything not that women are being abused but that when they have authority over children they are putting them in
(58:14) situations where they are abused or abusing them themselves that's what's actually happening we do have to change
() 
(58:19) prompts uh Andrew I think uh you wanted to perhaps discuss patriarchy and force
(58:24) doctrine you'd like to get into that go ahead yeah you can start yeah so I'll give you my definition of patriarchy
(58:30) first it's a historic definition it's means rule of the father i often will
(58:36) shortphrase this to from the father usually it operates around something which is patrineal lineage rather than
(58:43) matrinal lineage though not always you can have patriarchies where there's matrinal lineage you can find this in
(58:48) Judaism and other places like this when I talk about patriarchy and broadly speaking at least in modernity and in
(58:54) the last hundred years about men being in charge of general systems we could
(58:59) just say men being in charge of general systems head of the household head of the family things like this my view is
(59:05) that patriarchy is always going to end up being the default especially the more feminism there is you'll push more
(59:10) people into the patriarchy role and here's why because of force doctrine force doctrine is a doctrine which I
(59:17) came up with which tries to describe a phenomenon which you yourself are going to have to concede is true that half of
(59:23) the world right now if men decide to they can basically exterminate every
(59:29) single woman inside of their nations and there's not a damn thing women can do about it we can find this in most of the
(59:34) Middle Eastern nations we can find this basically anywhere that we look right they can't actually do anything about it
(59:40) also when it comes to rights rights are a social construction product of the mind because of that they are not
(59:46) inherent and since this is the case force is what is the practical applicator and if men decided to by
(59:53) force take away women's rights women cannot do anything about it the opposite is not true if women wanted to take away
(1:00:00) men's rights uh and men didn't want to let them they could not and because of
(1:00:05) this force doctrine application women's rights all come from men not inherently
(1:00:10) from themselves therefore feminism is a lie complete lie that's force doctrine i don't know
() 
(1:00:18) if you had anything to say about it um well aside from the fact that that is genuinely a terrifying idea um I think
(1:00:25) that the idea that men could just take away our rights and wipe us away is the nec is why feminism is necessary is
(1:00:32) because um we are trying to get enough men I suppose on our side if you think about it in terms of like a military occupation so that we that wouldn't
(1:00:38) happen um because I think that it is possible for men to take away our rights at a blanket pace but I don't agree with
(1:00:43) your conclusion based off that premise though i don't believe that women inherently don't have rights that it's given to us by men and the reason why is
(1:00:50) because I believe that all human beings inherently should have equality and human dignity which is a although I'm
(1:00:56) not Catholic it's a term that was very much focused on in my Catholic high school i went to public school and then Catholic
(1:01:02) about humanity yeah it's just a matter yeah i mean it's still like important though to me because I think that
(1:01:07) because the societies that we have created have necess necessitated the the need or have created the need for um
(1:01:14) laws and for structure and government and so there are many philosophers that have talked about how important it is to
(1:01:20) have government right but because of the fact that men can take it away does not mean that men g thus give to us right
(1:01:29) like men are not gods it is it is something that is inherent to each of us that we should have the ability to live and self-govern and have autonomy and um
(1:01:36) I think the fact that men could take it away actually goes to my point about how a lot of them do and a lot of them try to take our autonomy and um make us feel
(1:01:42) unsafe and harm us um which you were previously refuting but actually seems like you agree with me on that that it's
(1:01:48) a possibility for men to do that no no it's well it's descriptively true i'm not giving an aught i'm giving a
(1:01:53) descriptive of descriptive reality but because it's a descriptive reality we have the truth is is that you appealed
(1:01:58) to patriarchy i have no idea what I I have not said appeal to patriarchy what are you talking about when you said the
(1:02:05) whole goal is to get more men on our side you're appealing to a patriarch the whole goal but is a goal yes I should correct myself and so what you're trying
(1:02:11) to do is you're trying to appeal to the very demographic which can take away your rights at any time conceding that
(1:02:17) if you do not have them on your side you cannot maintain your rights that is not ever true of men which is
(1:02:24) why you'll always end up with a default patriarchy the more especially the more feminist push i don't know if you're looking at the modern world oh it's the
(1:02:30) modern world cuz not necessarily a default it's always going to be a default but in a lot of tribes they were very matriarchal and like women were at
(1:02:37) the head of the family there's never been a matriarch in the world that is not true at all give me one okay I will look it up it's going to be an Indian
(1:02:42) tribe and I'll refute it watch well indigenous people largely have it's going to be an Indian tribe and I'm going to refute it i think you should
(1:02:48) just use the term ind i think you should just use the term Indian i don't see any problem with it at all oh I think they do i don't think so indians themselves
(1:02:55) call themselves Indians often indigenous people in the United States do not call themselves Indians yes they
(1:03:00) do just like black people call themselves black people not African-American what are you talking about um do you think that all black
(1:03:06) people call themselves African-American this is a moot point so I'm not going to even go into this with you well you're the one who wanted to tell police and
(1:03:12) say that I had to say Native American instead of Indian um so basically I'm pulling up the matriarchs for you um and
(1:03:21) there are obviously a number of societies that have thrived and there's a whole document but in China um in
(1:03:27) Costa Rica the Briber people yeah name one any of them that you think is a
(1:03:32) matriarchy okay um a matriarchal society they have a society with an estimated 12,000 to 35,000 members that is a
(1:03:38) matriarchy and that is B R I B R I Bri in Costa Rica or you could look at the
(1:03:44) um there's a Kenyan tribe that's u M OJ A um that are all matriarchies they have
(1:03:50) women at the helm that are leading their why the Bribery tribe societies often describes matrineal it's not actually a
(1:03:57) matriarchy women are the heads of households responsible for passing down culture and land but the men have the
(1:04:02) most important role as the authority officers of the tribe they are the ones who defend and ult they have chiefs too
(1:04:09) male chief that's not a matriarchy well this I found a different article we could just go back and forth all day
(1:04:15) yeah let's look at it um so the brib so this is the intercontinental cryb bre i
(1:04:20) don't know if you speak Spanish but bribun matriarch mo so I speak a little bit not like I'm not like fully fluent
(1:04:26) but anyways and they're talking about how um the clan structure means that tribal lineage is passed down through
(1:04:31) the mother and matrineally yes and also in the home I know the difference but if something is matrinal doesn't make it a
(1:04:37) matriarchy i know but they're saying that women in this article play a primary role in in government as well in
(1:04:42) Yeah not but see what you did there you did a smuggle they play a primary role
(1:04:47) in government that doesn't make it a matriarchy but it's a system you know what a matriarchy is though it's a It
(1:04:53) would be women broadly in charge of all of the It's a system of social structure where they hold a lot of power they hold
(1:04:59) the majority power and the decisions of the men are at their behest in any but
(1:05:04) that's what the article just said of the Bree tribe i I don't know i don't know again I just found a different article any should speak to like what's going on
(1:05:11) matriarchy that I've ever investigated which is supposedly a matriarchy we find very quickly that men are in the
(1:05:17) prominent positions of authority on force which means that any matriarchy is living at the behest of the men that's
(1:05:23) it so is your point that men are better then because they have brute force or like what's your point that men should be in charge governmentally my point is
(1:05:29) not I'm not giving an aught we have to agree first to a descriptor the descriptive truth is that it is in fact
(1:05:36) the case that women have to appeal to men for all of their rights period by your own admission that's why you're
(1:05:42) trying to get them on your side because if you don't have them they can basically cage women up if they wanted
(1:05:47) to and there's nothing women but that doesn't mean that men are there for better or should be in charge like I'm
(1:05:52) confused like what's the actual point like the conclusion that you're making here the point here is that men being in charge is obviously and clearly they're
(1:05:59) very benevolent because at any time they so choose they can lock all women up there's nothing they can do about it and
(1:06:04) the reverse is not true which is so interesting you're literally at the mercy women are at the mercy globally
(1:06:10) and always have been of men and yet we're monstrized and demonized by
(1:06:15) feminists that's what we're we're literally considered demons by feminists you did it by your own admission today
(1:06:21) with your own stats trying to make us out to be sexually assaulting monsters didn't even know the counter stats didn't say that never yeah that's what
(1:06:27) it appears to be though from the onlookers perspective i feel like you have these generic like talking points
(1:06:32) that you try to apply to feminists but I haven't like really been very reactive or calling you names i'm trying not to i have but you you have acted exactly like
(1:06:38) a feminist today madame okay but um nobody's going to be confused about that at all the whole the whole snobbery the
(1:06:46) whole snobbery towards authority you're going to do what I want the finger clap thing you did the whole feminist trope
(1:06:51) the entire thing but what I would like is a reputation here can you agree i feel like it's my time can you agree
(1:06:57) that it is the case that women have to appeal to men for their rights and not
(1:07:03) the other way around i will not I will not ever agree to the fact that we should appeal to men for our rights i think that is an inherently misogynistic
(1:07:08) question have to have to no do not okay well then where do rights come from they should be
(1:07:16) inherent to every person but again I think I should be able to like this you make your So give me a second because
(1:07:21) again like you've just been a little bit insulting the last few minutes so I feel like when that happens it's just like a good change of pace is important um but
(1:07:28) well I I I do need to keep it on the topic at hand but which again where were we can you repeat the question rights i
(1:07:34) asked you where rights come from where rights come from if you can address that okay but then I get to respond yeah yeah
(1:07:40) you can but it's on force doctrine and rights go ahead okay um well I think the fact that we're debating a topic that
(1:07:45) you came up with is a little bit strange personally but um I was going to say that I think that rights are inherent um
(1:07:51) I think that they should be related to all people just like the fact that we are human beings we shouldn't have to
(1:07:57) appeal to any person for authority and again the fact that men are stronger bigger more powerful doesn't mean that
(1:08:02) they give or take away people's rights i'm not religious necessarily but I think if I if I was I would probably
(1:08:08) tell you that I think God is the person that you know relates and who is who gives people their human dignity and
(1:08:14) rights but I think it's inherent i think that we should all have the right to live and be free of violence and I think
(1:08:19) that those who offend and try to put people in cages those are the people that should be um jailed like I don't
(1:08:24) think that that's a a blanket statement yeah yeah so I would just Okay you keep on saying rights should be inherent that
(1:08:32) doesn't tell me anything about where rights come from where do rights come from where do we describe rights well I
(1:08:39) think that you're thinking very like United States like governmententric anywhere you can pick anywhere on planet
(1:08:45) i don't care where you pick where are rights coming from they are coming from the set of people that are in charge the
(1:08:51) government and to your point that's the patriarchy however I agree so I I concede to that point however I'm saying
(1:08:57) that that is not that does not mean that men since they create the ability to
(1:09:04) give people um like rights and take it away that doesn't mean that men it should be that way it shouldn't it like
(1:09:10) I don't know if that makes sense so men have been guaranteeing your rights the entire time you've been alive no that's
(1:09:15) definitely not true well I don't understand i thought that you just said rights come from the government the government is the patriarchy the
(1:09:21) patriarchy then is giving you rights right right but like the government isn't inherently like the government is
(1:09:26) influenced by patriarchy but it's not like all men making decisions like in the past it was would you say it's
(1:09:32) mostly in charge by men yeah but again like I think that your um your points
(1:09:37) that you're making are very uh misogynistic like I think the point of what you're saying listen is like we
(1:09:43) should be grateful to I think the points you're making are very misand that it doesn't tell us but I don't hate men so that's not a very good
(1:09:50) Okay but your question inherently is rooted in the fact that you think that there is male superiority and that men are in charge descriptively men are
(1:09:57) stronger than women yeah descriptively yes there's You're not going to argue that point right on average I suppose
(1:10:04) yeah yeah on average well I mean it's a strong average though sure yeah like I mean you know teenage soccer teams are
(1:10:10) beating you know female pro player teams right you agree that that's the case okay great so if that's the case and we
(1:10:16) can agree and you agree that the governments of the world are patriarchal then you have to concede that the
(1:10:23) patriarchy is giving you your rights right now i again I will never concede
(1:10:28) that and the reason why is because I think that that is rooted in the idea that women should be grateful like you're telling me that I should
(1:10:34) essentially be grateful to you for the fact that I'm not in a cage right now and that someone's not assaulting me as we speak like that does not mean that
(1:10:39) about just your like your right to free speech and the fact that it's enforced by men the patriarchy is the ones giving you that by your own admission listen so
(1:10:46) my theory is the way it should be this is what I think this is the way that it was before we had col you know colonization and all the imperialism and
(1:10:52) stuff there's a blanket statement right or there's a blanket right to to life to um autonomy to all these things right
(1:10:58) that are just given to you by the nature of being human and there are certain entities and people and oppressive
(1:11:03) regimes that then come in and they try to take those things away from you because waring tribe theory well because
(1:11:08) they they give you those things or because the government gives you the right to exist now right doesn't mean
(1:11:14) it's a benevolent uh patri like doesn't mean the patriarchy is benevolent because it is currently giving me these
(1:11:20) rights and I'm not like sitting and trapped in my house like I am what would make it malevolent
(1:11:26) what would make it malevolent um I think in places like um talking about here in
(1:11:31) the United States which is a patriarchy by your own admission giving you rights what would make it malevolent um I think
(1:11:36) that there are a lot of current things that are malevolent um like in legislation and things like that that are you know like right attacks on
(1:11:42) bodily autonomy and like the overturning like the DOS decision or the but you would consider your first amendment a
(1:11:48) benevolent right your third amendment your your fifth amendment I think these are things are all inherent gener like I
(1:11:53) don't like just because it's written in by the government doesn't mean that it should inherently be it can't be that's
(1:11:58) a contradiction you can't say it's inherent and the government gives them to us that's a contradiction the
(1:12:03) government does but it it doesn't mean anything like we should already have these things like just like if I how do
(1:12:09) you have them how do you have them absent government you should just be able to walk around and be free and how
(1:12:16) do you have that without force how how is it even possible i think you're looking at it through a lens of like
(1:12:22) imperialism and I don't think that like force was always ne it hasn't always been necessary i'm looking at it through a lens of I literally told you my lens
(1:12:29) of force doctrine explained it described it has nothing to do with imperialism has to do with this you're walking
(1:12:35) around there's no government if you're walking around there's no government where do your rights come from then
(1:12:40) okay this is just like such a silly question please answer the question okay
(1:12:47) so if I if there's no government and I'm walking around my right to be alive my
(1:12:54) right to uh find a can someone come around and kill my can someone come around and kill you yes but in that case
(1:13:00) there have historically always been place ways of punishing people who take those away so the people who take them
(1:13:05) away are Hold on just let her finish a government go ahead hold on then go ahead the people who take those things
(1:13:12) away from you if they don't decide to take it away it doesn't mean that they're good right so like a really
(1:13:20) horrible example that for a lot of women is true is if I am a woman and I have
(1:13:25) not had intercourse with anybody and a man is my friend and he decides that he's not going to take my virginity from
(1:13:32) me um does that mean he is a good person inherently by not assaulting me no it doesn't because that should be the
(1:13:38) standard right and so if someone comes in and they take it away and then they they tell me that they can or they can't
(1:13:44) in the future right that's essentially to me what you're saying is just because the government is is giving me the right
(1:13:50) to walk around and have this conversation with you today means that I should be thankful and I should you know
(1:13:55) not be concerned with things and that you guys are actually benevolent the patriarchy is benevolent because I'm not in a cage because I'm not being
(1:14:00) assaulted yeah that's not what it's being said anyway can you answer my question though where if there's no government where do your rights come
(1:14:07) from um I think we've already been over this i think you've asked me quite a few answer listen what you did was I mean
(1:14:14) I've already told you human dignity so well human human dignity account you can't account for dignity in a secular
(1:14:20) worldview what is dignity it's just whatever you think dignity is so tell me this real quick you have rights they're
(1:14:26) inherent i'm talking about legal moral or human let's let's omit legal right because I I'm talking about in a
(1:14:31) hypothetical okay moral and human rights in for me it's rooted in the
(1:14:37) philosophical natural law natural law is Catholic you don't believe in Catholicism you would have to have God
(1:14:43) to back up natural law okay but that is what I developed my beliefs around because I used to believe in that no
(1:14:48) that's a if you don't appeal to God for your natural rights you're making a naturalist fallacy okay
(1:14:55) how do you know that I don't believe in God because you told me okay well I just again I think this is like a really ridiculous Why is it ridiculous so where
(1:15:02) do you get your rights from if they're not from God um okay so again I still subscribe to
(1:15:09) the human rights theory which is uh the un universal declaration of human rights if you're if we're not going to go talk
(1:15:14) about God or naturalism right which is that every human being has universal inalienable rights that are fundamental
(1:15:20) to each person and so this is what you know the UN subscribes to and stuff like that regardless of whether there is a
(1:15:26) government in place or not so is that sufficient to you no that's an axiom that's so all you're just saying is I
(1:15:32) think we have inherent rights because I think we have inherent rights i think we have inherent rights because we are human beings who deserve to be treated
(1:15:38) with compassion love and respect and I don't think you think that so yeah but that's pretty wild but the qu the question comes in here let's say that a
(1:15:44) group of people doesn't believe in these inherent human rights right they don't believe in them i mean there are
(1:15:49) definitely groups that have Yeah they just don't believe in these inherent for certain people yeah they just don't so what is it that protects those inherent
(1:15:56) rights for you well you're right there is a typically like a system in place of
(1:16:02) force it's not force per se all force right
(1:16:07) anything that's not like there's a way to like isolate those people um with what force i mean not necessarily not
(1:16:16) what else could you isolate them with if they don't want to be isolated well not not every arrest is made through force right like they might Yeah well actually
(1:16:22) all all arrests are made through the implicit implicit threat of force either you come with me or else right sure so
(1:16:30) that would be force right you would agree with that the implicit yeah i mean just this inherent topic to me is very
(1:16:36) just like violent and seems like a moot point like um but I mean I'm kind of I I feel like we've talked this through no I
(1:16:42) haven't talked it through yet but you you can continue i mean I don't really have much else to say i've already like critique of your worldview so that we
(1:16:48) can understand who you're appealing to for these so-called rights you believe everybody has in this case it sounds like you're banking on force from men to
(1:16:55) protect your rights i mean how are you not how are you not banking on the force of men to protect your rights if you say
(1:17:00) they're inherent but all these inherent rights require force well also men is a is a generalization i mean again there
(1:17:06) are a lot of people who are currently working to enforce the system of government that we have it's not just men but they all rely on male force
(1:17:12) don't they i just told you that wasn't true i mean okay can you tell me how that's not true like what what agency of
(1:17:20) government doesn't rely on male force no no no my point is it's not all exclusively men there are men and women
(1:17:26) and everyone else as well that work to protect people here like like in the
(1:17:31) army it's not like if you're using force right the army isn't just male troops so like you're saying male Yeah there's there's there's women who aren't allowed
(1:17:37) in combat for the most part almost ever unless it's by accident who are in the military as pay masters and things like
(1:17:42) this but they're not the executors of force there's not female armies being fielded to protect rights i just I'm not
() 
(1:17:48) super interested in this line of questioning because it it just seems like misogynist if you're interested in
(1:17:53) it I want to know the worldview i think you care because like it's your podcast and like I'm kind of Okay well you know
(1:17:59) what in your next argument I'll just say "Well I'm just not very interested." Okay
(1:18:05) what does that do well you're not really letting me talk or like you know I'm just asking you basic questions you refuse to answer them that's it i just
(1:18:12) wish you would actually answer the questions and then we could get somewhere but you just refused to i'm like "Okay so what does that mean?" And
(1:18:17) you're like "Well I just explained it." when he didn't actually explain anything and then we get to the root of it so
(1:18:23) what you keep doing is appealing to patriarchy for your rights by saying I would never say I appeal to patriarchy for my rights you say hey I want to I
(1:18:30) want to appeal to men because we need men in order to protect us from the patriarchy which means you're appealing to men for your
(1:18:36) rights i just like it seems like it's a big circle so I'm just trying to decipher it out that's it
(1:18:43) that's it okay not not going to not going to engage anymore all right i I already told you I just don't have anything else to say on this so I I feel
(1:18:49) like we've had a good conversation i mean I I've enjoyed hearing what you have to say but I just don't have Yeah i mean I would have enjoyed you know like
(1:18:55) actually critiquing the view but since you don't make the view you have for like the last like 15 minutes yeah no you've just been very evasive and you've
(1:19:01) been very unwilling to actually answer questions even when you've contradicted yourself we want to acknowledge it so
() 
(1:19:06) okay well we can take a little uh there's more prompts but we'll uh take some audience questions there's some
(1:19:13) super chats that we can get to so we have uh let's see we have just Gerald
(1:19:20) here with the $100 super uh donated $100
(1:19:25) when women say "I wish I would have gone to school or focused on a career instead." I hear my children are
(1:19:31) preventing me from freedom if only these kids weren't alive I could be happy
(1:19:38) all right just Gerald thank you for that appreciate it all right and if you guys are enjoying the stream be sure to like
(1:19:45) the video please and uh make sure to uh Oh if you're watching on Twitch go to
(1:19:51) twitch.tv whatever drop us a follow and a prime sub and oh that's weird uh did
(1:19:58) that not go through okay going to get the soup chats here we have Cole Marshall why would anyone This is from
(1:20:03) earlier this came in i saw this that's funny uh why would anyone care if you leave who are you you're supposed to be
(1:20:09) defending your worldview w Andrew from Cole thank you Cole for the super chat do you want to respond to this or Oh
(1:20:14) sure yeah um yeah my name is Kylie Brewer i'm sort of like an upand cominging like activist type person um I
(1:20:20) I feel like I have my goal here was to educate um just about feminism generally
(1:20:26) so um I'm sorry if that hasn't like held up to your standards um but yeah I if I do leave I think the debate would end so
(1:20:32) I think that might be why people would care but anyways thank you for your comment we have chaotic fuzz why are you
(1:20:38) letting her hold the debate hostage she's being a child saying if I don't get my way I'll leave it's disrespectful
(1:20:44) to the platform and listeners um I think uh it's disrespectful to be
(1:20:50) talked down to the way I am um so that is why it's not just about like leaving
(1:20:55) and holding the platform hostage it is rather a fact of protecting my um integrity and I will never let myself be
(1:21:02) in a place where I feel unsafe or um like I'm being belittled so if that does happen and continues to happen I will
(1:21:08) leave and it's not a a reflection of you know the platform or anything it's just like for me um as well so okay we have
() 
(1:21:15) Lucas here ma'am kindly address your emotional dysregulation it's unimpressive but more importantly a
(1:21:21) telltale sign of an intellectual mediocrity flailing away wow a lot of big big words here Lucas uh in the
(1:21:29) undertoe of cognitive dissonance facious logic and ultimately a fully
(1:21:34) metastasized mind virus do you want do you want to respond to that from Lucas sure um Lucas it sounds like you pulled
(1:21:41) out your thesaurus for this so congratulations on that but I would like to say I have my IQ is relatively pretty
(1:21:46) high i'm not going to like talk about where I went to an Ivy League but that doesn't matter if you disagree with me you're going to hate what I have to say
(1:21:51) regardless of whether I'm intelligent or not intelligent so but thank you for watching regardless thank you Lucas for the message little Miss Feminist isn't
(1:21:58) interested in debating only educating bad faith debate you want to respond to that thank you uh Reszle for the soup
(1:22:04) chat um for me like a debate is about exchange of knowledge so if it doesn't become that it feels more like um an ad
(1:22:10) homonym attack on me I just will not talk well what it what a debate is to me is the reputation of ideas uh or it can
(1:22:18) be the sharing of knowledge also the reputation of ideas we're here to debate feminism the idea of debating feminism
(1:22:24) that I'll even grant one point that my opponent got which was me dunking on me right was that I confused the mankind
(1:22:30) initiative with the mankind project right so that's one thing one thing I even did right dunked on myself right by
(1:22:38) misspeaking on on one of these things so there's a concession but here's what I won't do what I won't do is let you
(1:22:45) cross your arms and throw a fit and refuse to engage when you go no I'm just not going to engage anymore it's like
(1:22:51) Well then we're not having a debate anymore so I'd like to get back to the actual debate and I'd like to continue i
(1:22:58) like don't have as much of a stake in this as you do so like I'm definitely if we end right now I'm more than happy like I'm so serious i would go and like
(1:23:06) lay out in the sun enjoy the farmers market i'm here to You're just not So so why did you come to a debate if you're unprepared to debate oh because no I'm
(1:23:12) not unprepared i thought we were going to have more of an exchange and this feels more like again like an attack so that's why I'm not having very much fun i mean look I don't think that's a fair
(1:23:19) characterization of the exchange you guys had there was a slightly open to
(1:23:24) interpretation there was a slightly heated moment exchange from both of you at the beginning of the show i think
(1:23:30) it's okay we're going to continue on with the conversation let allow me to let uh we have about three chats coming
(1:23:35) through and then we'll get back to the debate rachel Wilson says "This is by the way this is uh Andrew's uh wife
(1:23:42) here." Oh uh nobody's talking down to you princess uh oh she wants to do Colin uh do you want to talk to to Andrew's
(1:23:48) wife maybe she can get some i don't know but okay uh Andrew is just beating your arguments easily and you feel embarrassed so you're pretending he's
(1:23:54) insulting you okay thank you Rachel for that appreciate it donner page 199 section 6.3 of the NIS-4 shows all the
(1:24:02) stats Andrew pointed out about female perpetrators anyone in chat can look it up all right thank you for that even
(1:24:10) though she said she looked it up in two seconds even though there's no possible way on uh somebody says unmute okay
(1:24:18) thank you Andrew i'm not sure what's going on with that but we have two chat two chats coming here and then we'll
(1:24:23) come back to the debate so we have one sec we have Glockavius thank you
() 
(1:24:28) Gloavius glavius donated $100 kylie you said you have a high IQ
(1:24:36) what's your IQ um I haven't taken an IQ test in a while but when I was a child
(1:24:41) they had me evaluated for having a high IQ because I was like talking really young and all these things but the last time I took a test I think it was like
(1:24:46) around a 150 but I don't know currently it was a while ago 150 that's genius
(1:24:52) level and I know you're going to say I'm not so it's like funny but I know it's you probably think it's ironic i didn't say anything i just said that that's
(1:24:58) considered genius level thank you he was about to congratulate you oh sorry i'm on the defense a little bit but thank
(1:25:04) you i appreciate it Andrew i appreciate it poor me i just have an an average IQ okay we literally have average IQ and
(1:25:10) you know what look here here's a little you know a lot of the soup chats been a little mean yolo Swagons says you're hot
(1:25:17) thank you so if it's any uh you know if it's any you know thank you YOLO Swagons
(1:25:23) for that that does actually make me feel nice thank you YOLO Swagons and then chat here then we'll get back to the
(1:25:28) debate sixpack Chad donated oneack Chad i didn't go to school for 4 years to be
(1:25:34) talked to like this the girl boss can't handle the big meanie andrew you are the
(1:25:39) most insufferable broad I've ever seen on this show including the hookers we have had a couple hookers yeah um I've
(1:25:47) actually had that uh said to me quite a few times so I'm sorry you feel that way but I'm glad you like Andrew and like
(1:25:54) you guys have that sort of connection i think it's important to have people that you look up to and content and stuff and uh so getting back to the debate at hand
(1:26:01) Andrew did you want to continue on with the force doctrine conversation i but like I need you to actually engage with
(1:26:07) my inquiry the the reason I'm giving you maybe Oh I thought we were going to switch topics oh we're staying on this one so the I think he wanted to just
(1:26:13) finish yeah we weren't done with it okay okay yeah so the reason I want you to engage with it is because it's a
(1:26:19) falsifier for your worldview okay and if you refuse to engage it looks like you're just refusing to allow the
(1:26:25) falsifier for your worldview so can can we get if we can get back to it I'd like to my question starts with inherent
(1:26:31) rights you claim that they're inherent and I'm asking you if a government's not giving them to you and God's not giving
(1:26:38) them to you where are they coming from that's a good question so if we just
(1:26:43) existed there was no government and I was an atheist I would in theory have the uh ability the right to walk around
(1:26:50) freely to make myself food to do all these things without the fear of uh violence but if violence did happen um
(1:26:58) then we would have to create how would you in theory be because I believe that communities to just walk around without
(1:27:03) any threat of violence because there were plenty of communities that have done that in Does a rabbit have the ability to walk around without any
(1:27:09) threat of violence inherently no but I'm I'm not a rabbit yeah I know but the thing is is like why not why doesn't the
(1:27:15) rabbit have that because there are predators so what would our predator be are you saying men are the predators well or women or But if men are the
(1:27:21) predators that goes against everything we talked about or women did you hear that part or women like women can
(1:27:27) assault you doesn't require a man doesn't require a penis for somebody to assault you so the thing is is like if
(1:27:32) it is the case then that that the rabbit has no inherent rights because there's
(1:27:38) predators or people who would be predatory or even if we said that there would be some men who would be predatory
(1:27:43) even mhm how do you have this right to walk around unmolested and the rabbit
(1:27:48) does not um so you are wanting me to say that we have force we have to enforce it
(1:27:56) right which we do but I don't think we have to enforce it through like physical force i think we can enforce it through
(1:28:02) like words and like being able to like speak to each other and then like the rabbit screams and the coyote doesn't care so if it's a case that people don't
(1:28:09) care about whatever the wolves don't care about what the rabbit says right they don't care about the rabbit screams
(1:28:15) does the rabbit have rights um if the wolf doesn't care if the
(1:28:20) rabbit screams does the rabbit have rights is an interesting question i
(1:28:26) suppose the rabbit has the right to not get eaten by the wolf but like again I mean
(1:28:31) I think most people would agree that there is a fundamental distinction between humans and animal societies so I
(1:28:37) don't understand how it's relevant to my point in this case the equation would just be a rabbit is a biological walking
(1:28:44) being right and so is a wolf the rabbit does not have the right not to get eaten by the wolf what gives you any inherent
(1:28:51) right to not be in any way assaulted molested undignified or whatever if if
(1:28:57) it is the case that people want to do this to you what is the inherent right there right i could I could ask you the
(1:29:03) same thing yeah but why don't you answer the question then ask yours no no no i'm I'm saying like like I could ask like
(1:29:09) figuratively I could ask you the same thing in terms of like what would give you the right to walk around and to like
(1:29:15) be respected and have your wife Rachel like you know like talk to you and force but I don't I don't think it has to be i
(1:29:21) think historically a lot of it has been force but I don't think it has to be i think there exists an egalitarian
(1:29:27) society where we can all collectively have the ability and you know we they used to just I don't even disagree with
(1:29:33) this can can this happen well they used to just um like sort of expel people out
(1:29:38) of the community and they wouldn't be able to survive without the community like they would die and so that's not
(1:29:44) necessarily in my mind force yeah it's force they can't go back to the community so people are forcing them out
(1:29:49) right but it's not like a physical force it's physical force it's backed up by physical force why can't you go back into the community what happens well
(1:29:56) there's also the emotional component of like ignoring the person not giving them food it's not That's not what people did they didn't ignore them they said "If
(1:30:01) you come back here there's going to be consequences right otherwise that's not really a banishment i mean what would
(1:30:06) stop them from just walking in and being like "You can ignore me but I'm going to take your food and whatever I need to survive." Sure um but the point being
(1:30:14) for me I believe that because those types of societies are possible to exist
(1:30:20) right without the physical threat of force and having to put people in cages and kill people to preserve the social
(1:30:27) order then therefore I think that we should not have to um have a patriarchy
(1:30:33) or a matriarchy i think we should just be able to exist in the right because the right come within us i I agree that
(1:30:39) you can have all sorts of different arrangements for how a society because of those things then yeah but that
(1:30:45) doesn't give us the answer here for why it is that the rabbit doesn't have the right to not get eaten by the but you
(1:30:52) have the right to not get assaulted by another human being what gives you that right i mean I don't think I'm going to at any point give you the answer that
(1:30:58) you're looking for i'm just looking for the answer what you said is because future societies can look different that
(1:31:03) doesn't tell me anything that's really not like what I was saying i was also drawing from the past but um I I mean
(1:31:08) personally I think that Sorry the problem here is that we
(1:31:14) have seen um we have seen the patriarchy as something that should be either seen
(1:31:22) as malevolent or benevolent and I don't think that it should be classified as
(1:31:28) something that we need generally speaking i think there are systems of organization where we don't have to rely
(1:31:34) upon men can I try this because that seems to be what you're trying to Let me try a different way can you repeat my
(1:31:40) question to me so I know that you understand what my question is no no no i I would just I mean again can you
(1:31:46) repeat my question to me so I know you understand what it is please i'm getting real close i'm Why because you won't
(1:31:53) answer this question right i am answering in a way that you don't find satisfactory i'll say "What do you want to eat tonight?" And you go "Margarine
(1:31:59) hat." It's like it doesn't tell me nothing but you're asking me the question repetitively because you won't answer it no no no i won't answer it in
(1:32:05) the way that you want no you just won't answer it period listen do you think Do you think it's a fair answer for you to say "How tall are you?" And I say
(1:32:12) "83." Is that an answer well I don't I don't need an answer from like I'm not demanding i'm not someone who you're
(1:32:18) looking at me like I have to answer you like just because I'm here doesn't mean I have to do anything what are you doing in a debate if you won't answer questions about your worldview i mean
(1:32:24) there's a lot of reasons to be here right like answering questions about your worldview your brand do you think
(1:32:29) you're promoting your brand well when you won't answer questions about your worldview I mean that's objective and I have been answering questions you
(1:32:35) haven't you what you've done is every single time I ask you this question right you appeal to something that
(1:32:40) doesn't answer it you say "Well there could be future according to you." Okay I'll tell you what but I've given you the answers I have that's why you're
(1:32:47) trying to force me into a corner that I just I don't have the answer let's try this let's try this instead right because when people people do this all
(1:32:52) the time they say "I am answering the question." When they're not answering any question at all can we just try this
(1:32:58) can can you just give me a re like real quick summary where do rights come from
(1:33:04) okay so I think that and I'm you're going to say "But you don't believe in God." So but I'm going to give you
(1:33:09) because this seems to be the only naturalist or the only explanation you will accept for from me is the naturalist explanation i think that they
(1:33:15) are inherent and let's say human beings are God right some people believe that each person has an essence that belongs
(1:33:20) to God so let's say that so therefore it's it comes from God we are God i believe that each person is made up of a
(1:33:27) collective that could be considered like a human spirit so yes so but you don't believe in God but a human spirit to me
(1:33:33) is God so I think that each person has the ability to self-govern and those rights are given to us by ourselves
(1:33:40) because whether we're God or not okay the rights come from us okay yes so and and that's coming from the humanist
(1:33:46) perspective so rights come from you the individual that makes Okay that's at least an answer so rights come from
(1:33:53) individuals so how do individuals then if they grant themselves these rights
(1:33:58) keep them um by communication and compassion i'm
(1:34:04) an optimist so ideally we don't have to use force and somebody does not uh want to agree with you and says I don't care
(1:34:11) what you say what what what happens then so okay I will I will concede your point
(1:34:18) that to preserve the order to preserve rights sure you would have to appeal to
(1:34:23) force then there are occasional needs for force sure okay well let me make this
(1:34:30) because I know that's what you're trying to Let me make this even wider let me make this even wider i don't believe that you can name any any uh type of
(1:34:39) governmental system or any type of anything in which force is not going to be the backer for what the establishment
(1:34:44) is period i don't even think it's possible like how could it even be possible that you're not always force
(1:34:50) let's say I concede then what's your point like relating back to my point is always yeah you're always going to be
(1:34:57) appealing to men for your rights but why do men have to be the enforcers like let's say your forces like force do because women can't overpower men only
(1:35:03) men can but weapons exist so like what if women is better with weapons and who who makes weapons okay but what if like
(1:35:10) women somehow took over all the weapons and going into this hypothetical right sure women take over all the weapons we
(1:35:15) teach each other how to use it and men can't do anything in theory could then a matriarchy exist so I could say that it
(1:35:22) would I'm genuinely curious yeah yeah so I could say it's logically possible but just so you know when I say logically
(1:35:28) possible Superman's logically possible Wolverine's logically possible all the X-Men are logically possible though I
(1:35:34) can say that this is logically possible that women could seize all the means of production all weapons and enslave men
(1:35:39) logically there's no contradiction the descriptor for reality though is that I would say descriptively in reality it's
(1:35:45) impossible that women could never overpower uh men collectively take over
(1:35:51) any means of production nor begin to produce weapons ever and have any great effect if men didn't want them to it's
(1:35:58) not even possible i don't I don't see how it's possible so your conclusion though is based off of this scenario that you are saying isn't possible but
(1:36:05) you're saying it's it's logical so I mean I I disagree i think it is possible though like but try to understand the
(1:36:11) difference between logical possibility which just means no contradiction yes so almost anything's logically possible
(1:36:16) yeah right um it just seems like like there's a world in which you're a man and a misogynistic man that's logically
(1:36:24) possible right yeah so like so that doesn't tell us much right but but I'm saying like your force doctrine though
(1:36:32) like you're saying okay so let's say I agree with the fact that force is necessary to keep a necessary
(1:36:37) precondition right so let's say I agree yeah but then your conclusion that you're male because of this men are the
(1:36:44) enforcers right because they're physically bigger therefore men give us our rights yeah well no i would give it
(1:36:50) I'll give it to you in this premise form it would work like this yes women cannot collectively overpower men men can
(1:36:57) always collectively overpower women because the sexes need each other literally need each other cannot be
(1:37:04) disassociated otherwise there's no humanity um it there'll always be a banking of an enforcement arm which
(1:37:10) protects women and men and children and that will always have to go to men because men are the physically dominant
(1:37:16) sex so if that's the case it will always be the case you have to appeal to men for the very rights in which you you
(1:37:23) think you have right um yeah so I mean I think that what
(1:37:29) follows what based off of what you're saying makes sense but I I'm still going to always disagree with the fact that
(1:37:35) women like your like your initial statement that women cannot uh overpower men with weapons i just I think that
(1:37:42) that would be Can you name a time has ever happened in history collectively doesn't mean it can't just because something hasn't happened doesn't mean
(1:37:47) it can't happen wolverine can't h Wolverine can happen superman can go on with this forever right but no but not
(1:37:52) really because if we're talking about descriptive reality do you honestly believe that you're only disagreeing
(1:37:58) with this cuz you just don't want to agree right cuz you said "I agree that what you're saying it makes sense." I just fundamentally don't think this is
(1:38:04) like a very u entire worldview because you'd have to say that you have to appeal to pages
(1:38:11) here of like rather talking about like I don't understand this kicks the pillar of your worldview out do you believe
(1:38:17) that you need to appeal to men for you to be safe or not
(1:38:22) do I need to appeal to men to be safe or not currently in the patriarchal society yes do we should we have to do can is it
(1:38:29) possible for us to not have to yes and do men protect you not always yeah
(1:38:36) but mostly unfortunately no not even mostly aren't they the ones who are aren't they yes mostly i'm sorry are
(1:38:42) most women dying are most women dying from violence no so they're mostly being protected it depends on what you mean by
(1:38:48) like protect though from harm like there's just a lot that women are harmed by men on a day like you live in a
(1:38:53) nation in which you're granted massive amounts of rights you're protected while you sleep you can dial 911 have officers
(1:39:00) there almost immediately in most places but you're attributing all that to men they're the enforcement arm of all of those collectives yes right so like
(1:39:07) police officers you would agree vast majority male right and that women tend to uh to
(1:39:14) underperform in almost every standard because we lower standards for police officers so that women can be them even
(1:39:19) though they don't actually perform very well against their male compatriots do they sure so if that's the case then
(1:39:24) you're still appealing to men aren't you sure okay i just I don't really want Yeah I know i know you you'll just concede just to concede i mean
(1:39:31) fundamentally I don't think this is very interesting it's kind of funny right it's there's a reason this isn't taught in like a man's verbally assaulting you
(1:39:36) you're just rolling over and taking it cuz you got it you just roll it over i would actually prefer to leave you just went dead fish on me right you like a
(1:39:44) like a bear is attacking you went dead fish because you just can't refute the arguments it's not about that it's just
(1:39:49) about not being disrespected if I feel like I'm being I'm not disrespecting you by asking you questions about your worldview no no no you're just being um
(1:39:56) how do I say very uh demanding and overbearing because it's actually I know I know I'm like debate I need you to
(1:40:03) answer my question that I would rather talk about and we've been talking about your topic for 45 minutes and I've barely even had a opportunity to steer
(1:40:09) this conversation do you have a bunch of topics that you brought i brought one why can't we talk about mine too we are
(1:40:15) oh great then what's your complaint you're hiding a little behind the mic
(1:40:20) can you try to You don't know now what your complaint is did you Did that argument not work very well you brought 10 topics i brought one you don't want
(1:40:27) to talk about my one topic but we should talk about your 10 fantastic fine we can move on but unbelievable
(1:40:34) we will do a couple chats here and then we'll get into our next topic then bring in the chats i'm going to go out of
(1:40:40) smoke all right he sounds good maybe you should just Can you pause it or do should I stay here while he goes out can I take a break after him yeah we can we
(1:40:47) can do that uh okay so we have Xerxes here or actually Xerxes donated $100 on
(1:40:55) these hi Kylie are you a communist or anti- capitalist can women be sexist
(1:41:01) towards men can minorities be racist towards white people is misogyny worse
(1:41:07) than Missandre that's a that is a great question yeah sorry can I answer it yeah
(1:41:12) you know what why don't we do this just cuz maybe Andrew will want to weigh in on he'll probably have things to say we'll wait okay that's fine let's see if
(1:41:19) any of these here i'll let this one come through because this one's kind of just general red Fox donated
(1:41:26) $100 humanism naturalism theism and relativism what a mess your world view
(1:41:33) in incoherent and destructive your pretentious presentation is a turnoff
(1:41:39) bring on Mrs wilson not one step back anything you want to respond to there um
(1:41:46) no i I just wasn't like prepared on this subject and it's an interesting topic so
(1:41:52) I will uh learn more i mean I'm always open to learning more so I will go do my research got Jason thank you Jason jason
(1:41:59) Castle donated $100 thank you man people sleep peaceibly in their beds at night
(1:42:04) only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf this quote sums
(1:42:09) up reality but you refuse to concede because you don't like men dumb yeah I
(1:42:14) really um I do believe that men are important figures in our society and I admire a lot of the bravery of men um so
(1:42:22) if you want to call me stupid whatever you want to call me that's totally fine but I never said that I hate men i I do
(1:42:29) believe that men are important and I like men i'm close with my dad i have a partner who is a man right now so yeah
(1:42:35) all right and if you guys want to get your own message in you can do so streamlabs.com whatever we're doing $100
(1:42:41) TTS we have Jordan Flores here hey thank you Jordan appreciate it jordan Flores donated $100 thank you can someone tell
(1:42:49) her that the restaurant kids menu crossword puzzle isn't an IQ test also
(1:42:54) ironically enough when she mentions quitting every 15 minutes it proves Andrew's point yeah Jordan I'm not I'm
(1:43:01) not like mentioning quitting i'm genuinely trying to leave here because I do not enjoy this environment it's very
(1:43:07) hostile um and I know that the restaurant menu is not an IQ test that's kind of a funny joke though but thank
(1:43:12) you okay we have some super chats here honest question for the feminist how's
(1:43:17) feminism in any way about equality when every single policy and law it advocates for is literally a move away from
(1:43:24) equality even Charles Forier who coined the term feminism was a staunch
(1:43:29) massandrist drist maybe a little typo there but do you want to answer Manny's
(1:43:34) question here um yeah so I mean again that's an absolute not every policy is
(1:43:40) about a move away from equality feminism has never been about female supremacy it has been about the importance of
(1:43:46) creating equality between the sexes and creating protections um from you know for for women in various areas economic
(1:43:53) political whatever it is so um yeah I don't know if that answers your question but all right we have Andrew back here
(1:43:59) manny thank you for that soup chat we have two from Lucas here and uh two more it looks like some on Streamlabs lucas
(1:44:05) thank you man uh honey you don't want to go toe-to-toe on credentials and alphabet soup with me i assure you the
(1:44:13) alphabet soup is far more expansive than the law degree that Brian and Andrew might possibly be aware of that
(1:44:20) notwithstanding as logician rehetor rhetoric rhetoric rhetoric and debater
(1:44:26) Andrew continued is superior to me by order of magnitude rest assured that
(1:44:31) piece of paper signifying your full-fledged year four full-fledged
(1:44:36) years of imbecillic indoctrination is mean meaningless oh but hey how many
(1:44:41) genders are there would love to hear your take on that do you want want to respond to uh him on that or
(1:44:49) Lucas on that i bathroom break if you have anything to say because remember I
(1:44:55) was going to Yeah do you want to do a quick response to Lucas or Oh okay and then feel free to take um Yeah that's an
(1:45:00) interesting um that's an interesting question um I think that for me I
(1:45:06) believe that sex is biological so it's what's assigned at birth you know so it's like male female and then gender I think is really like open to
(1:45:12) interpretation but like definitely you know man woman um trans man transwoman non-binary are the ones that I really
(1:45:18) like you know see pretty often but you know there's room i I mean I just think it's very individual so but yeah good
(1:45:23) question okay yeah feel free to take your break we'll uh read a couple chats here all right we've got one sec

(1:48:40) TTSDreamlabs.com/ whatever we do have a chat coming through here from let's see
() 
(1:48:46) this one yeah Xerxes donated $100 hi Kylie are you a communist or
(1:48:52) anti- capitalist can women be sexist towards men can minorities be racist
(1:48:58) towards white people is misogyny worse than misandry so there's like four there
(1:49:03) why don't we start with the first one um how do you what's how do you categorize
(1:49:09) yourself i guess um I'm reluctant to use any like label in terms of this but I think that there are like definitely
(1:49:15) cons to capitalism but there are a lot of pros like um you know like ingenuity and like invention and creativity so
(1:49:20) yeah um but I think that there's always room for improvement in a system but no I would never describe myself as like a
() 
(1:49:26) communist or anything like that okay and then there was the uh can women be sexist towards men yeah uh good question
(1:49:34) i think that women can definitely like have like not like men and have like a lot of like maybe prejudice towards men
(1:49:40) but I think like just the term sexism generally refers to like a systemic issue so like you know how for decades
(1:49:46) and decades like women couldn't uh you know work in certain fields or they couldn't get a job women couldn't open a bank account until 1974 that's like
(1:49:53) sexism because it's a systemic issue so that's the way that I think of it obviously I'm sure he has different opinions on that um but yeah men but
(1:50:01) you're not here to elevate women over men even though No I would like for women to like be but they can't be
(1:50:08) sexist though only men because it's systemic there was one more right
(1:50:14) uh yes but it seems like Andrew wants to engage you on that but here uh yeah
(1:50:19) we'll go how about we'll go through all I feel like we might go for a while on that one yeah so we'll we'll we'll get back to it but can minorities so I guess
() 
(1:50:26) like black Latino whatever can minorities be racist towards white people um there's there yeah like there's
(1:50:35) definitely um an a level of like maybe strong dislike or like maybe like prejudice towards white people but I
(1:50:40) would say the same thing about uh like serious like like racism is like systemic like there were laws to uphold
(1:50:45) it like you know Jim Crow laws and a bunch of other laws to uphold um you know even like the institution of
(1:50:51) slavery which is really you know for like hundreds of years and so because of that the the racism that is embedded
(1:50:56) into like our laws whether on purpose or not on purpose in the United States is systemic and so that makes racism
(1:51:03) primarily that way um and yeah so I don't think minorities can be racist to
(1:51:10) white people i think it's prejudice though i think the terms are different it's like you know you know what I mean like the hatred or the the fear exists
(1:51:16) about certain groups but the term is the way I explained it okay and then the final one was just uh is misogyny worse
() 
(1:51:24) than misandry um yeah I would say so and the reason why is because misogyny is
(1:51:29) built into uh laws and policies as well versus misandry is just like a lot of the time is rooted in genuine fear
(1:51:37) doesn't make it you know okay but I think like it's better to you know see people as they are but um I think
(1:51:43) misogyny is again more of like a deeply systemic issue and a lot of violence gender- based violence is rooted in
(1:51:48) misogyny um which cannot necessarily be said for the other way around obviously there's always exceptions to everything
(1:51:54) got it and then so Andrew there was the can women be sexist towards men can minorities be racist so I reject Yeah so
(1:52:00) I categorically reject these definitions these are what are called institutional definitions what they are as their
(1:52:06) definitions in order to reinforce a worldview rather than actually give descriptions for what is
(1:52:13) reality so if we're talking about race for instance right and racism uh if
(1:52:18) you're talking about what are perceived racial groups why couldn't minorities be
(1:52:23) racist towards the majority well what they what academics do is they play this pretentious game where they're like well
(1:52:29) you have to have institutional power well that's also Hold on uh can you just I I hate to interrupt you Andrew uh can
() 
(1:52:36) you just can you repeat what you just said to me privately there yes um I would I will be needing to leave at 6
(1:52:43) p.m so for anyone who is leaving um or who was watching and not 6:30 because uh I have a lot of reasons and one is that
(1:52:50) I have to drive 2 hours tonight um in the dark so I would like to leave at 6 p.m and I'm making that known and um I
(1:52:57) hope that our agreement can be fulfilled uh but can you specify I mean you agreed
(1:53:02) to do 6:30 I thought 6:30 that that was the agreed upon right yeah
(1:53:09) um I mean I don't again asking me to continue to explain myself is a little bit tiring but I just I there's a lot of
(1:53:16) reasons I mean I have some health issues I just sitting here for this prolonged period I was not told by the way that
(1:53:22) this was going to be 3 hours I thought it was going to be an hour max so I agreed we didn't we didn't specify that
(1:53:28) it was going to be an hour max So why would I actually was very poor communication
(1:53:33) on your end but anyways I'm telling you that I will be leaving communication on your end you're going to a show and didn't bother asking how long it was
(1:53:39) going to be no I did when I got here but I will be Wait wait wait wait when you got here i'm I'm leaving at 600 okay so
(1:53:47) we can have as much of a debate as we want yeah we we understand that's not satisfactory i would like I will leave now like I'm just letting you know like
(1:53:53) this is not an environment for me that I am uh Oh my god you whine so much you're such a whiner you just whine and cry
(1:54:00) yeah i'm I'm just letting you know i don't But what was Okay what was the other thing you said we can't do a debate he's going to ask me questions
(1:54:06) about my will be deal wasn't prepared for i'm just here to teach and monologue and I don't want I don't want [ __ ]
(1:54:11) ridiculous if the con like we I signed something about coming agreed she agreed to 6:30 right in front of me i like and
(1:54:18) now she's retracting it it's like what what is going on i don't know and mind you uh Andrew has just already done two
(1:54:25) debates he did one on Friday and and flew in also for my opponent and very
(1:54:31) kind to me you're welcome those debates I also don't live here i flew in i'm in Chicago so right those those debate Wait
(1:54:38) I'm a little confused you flew in i flew in my have family that lives an hour away so I spent you know a little bit of
(1:54:44) time with them this morning and then I'm going to see them again before I fly out tomorrow well okay that we'll discuss that after
(1:54:50) the show but um and the if you looked at our channels and the length of our
(1:54:56) previous debates the past two debates that we had were gone 5 hours and yeah I
(1:55:02) mean again I have health problems yeah but why would you have a different are
(1:55:07) you [ __ ] serious [ __ ] serious why would you have a different assumption why would But why how would we know that i'm telling you now of course but don't
(1:55:15) you think that if you saw the last two episodes they went 5 hours why would you presume that yours was going to go less
(1:55:20) and that we would know you had health issues because I'm telling you I have When you get to the show oh my god wow
(1:55:27) this is an initial this is a disclosure now but look so we're going to continue the conversation but there was one other
() 
(1:55:33) thing you said to me there in private she's like she's you're fundamentally a dishonest person like fundamentally
(1:55:39) dishonest there's no reason for you to have hold that presumption at all on top of the there being no reason for you to
(1:55:44) hold that presumption whatsoever uh you get to the studio then say you have health issues it's like yeah you know it
(1:55:51) seems fundamentally dishonest right i mean that's just kind of something that you don't want to disclose cuz it's a little embarrassing
(1:55:58) but we're not asking you are you going to cry look strong woman we're not asking you i thought you were a strong
() 
(1:56:04) woman you guys have a really good day i'm leaving hold on we're not asking hold on hold on we're not Look I thought
(1:56:10) you were strong woman kylie do you want to just take like three minutes to gather no I'm leaving like I'm driving
(1:56:16) home um I mean you look you agreed to I agreed to appear not stay for the entire
(1:56:22) Yeah but that you can't do some technicality where Well I showed up for 2 minutes and I'm just going to leave
(1:56:27) and get the benefits of Look Kylie just take a five minute breather
(1:56:33) it's You still there Kylie yeah I'm here look do you want to take a five minute breather come back and we'll we'll talk
(1:56:39) more okay um All right uh here I'll do some chats i'll read
(1:56:47) some chats uh let's see here we have Oh boy there's a lot um and I and I think we were about to
(1:56:54) get into a really good segment there when it came to uh is misogyny worse
(1:57:00) than uh mis misandry uh can you be uh sexist towards men can or can women be
(1:57:06) sexist towards men so let's do this uh here we got Wait Kylie you I'm great i'm happy
(1:57:14) okay okay that's fine all right I just uh All right so we have Red Fox here
(1:57:22) red Fox donated $100 brian great job as a mod andrew I
(1:57:28) am sorry you have been putting in so much work and this is the quality of your opponent glad your family is safe
(1:57:36) not one step back look bring on the blood sport and for those of you I know there's probably a few of you in chat
(1:57:41) who are like "How would he do that?" Well here's the thing right it's like I've been engaging in good faith engaging in a a typical debate they're
(1:57:49) going to they're you know what I mean and the whole time it's been all about tone and Andrew's bad and this and it's like you know and then we get to it she
(1:57:56) lied to routine she agreed to 6:30 before the cameras rolled i'm telling you she not only agreed to it but uh
(1:58:02) basic I mean they discussed it and she was like "Yeah 6:30." Then she changes
(1:58:07) her mind right and then kind of was very dishonest about the reasoning behind it
(1:58:13) and you know there's a form of female manipulation which happens when they're like I don't want to disclose any health issues because it could be embarrass
(1:58:19) it's like well then why did you agree to the show we didn't ask about the Yeah no but of course not it's all fundamentally
(1:58:25) dishonest and so it's like you know what am I supposed to do am I supposed to look at her when they turn on the waterworks when you know it's clearly
(1:58:31) manipulation and be like "Oh okay then yeah [ __ ] that [ __ ] that." I've had two
(1:58:36) really good faith interlocators we've gone back and forth with i don't hold any ill will towards them but it's like
(1:58:41) you came to do the debate i flew out here to do the debate do the [ __ ] debate stop you know what I do just do the debate
(1:58:48) yeah yeah and uh and I think we've been uh probably very I don't know if
(1:58:54) charitable is the right word but uh almost uh bent over backwards yeah
(1:59:01) like you know uh super annoying really at the beginning she was trying to
(1:59:08) dictate terms and look to the audience I know you guys didn't like that I was trying to kind of plate things a little bit but in you know like I was telling
(1:59:15) Andrew just in furtherance of ensuring that the debate actually happens if you got to you
(1:59:21) know walk back an inch you know to to be able to make it further then so be it but uh we let me
(1:59:29) do these super chats while they come through yo Gerald appreciate it coastal operator thank for the membership uh
(1:59:35) okay jj Mad thank you for that message uh let's see here we have
(1:59:43) uh I'm honestly kind of lost on some of the chats here okay all good
(1:59:51) yeah I'm good all right um oh whoops didn't mean to do that
(1:59:58) uh so okay here's where we left off right right uh Xerxes was uh can women
(2:00:05) be sexist towards men can minorities be racist towards white people is misogyny worse than uh mis misandry excuse me uh
(2:00:12) Andrew it seemed like you wanted to uh yeah so it's just it's just academic double speak it's just it's a way for
(2:00:19) them to hold uh dualistic standards so um what they mean by what they mean by
(2:00:26) racism is exactly what they mean by racism across the board it's just that in order to make whatever they consider
(2:00:33) the oppressive class not be oppressed they call it something else by saying there's not enough institutional power but if you were to ask them something
(2:00:39) like well what about over in South Africa right they would still say that
(2:00:44) nope whites really have the institutional power there no matter what no matter what so it's like um it's
(2:00:49) never and I've been in these debates multiple times it's never a consistent definition it's an academic double speak
(2:00:56) uh um when it comes to misogyny worse than Missandry yeah right um the only
(2:01:03) reason that she says that is because she believes in a bunch of stats which are completely false they're totally false we've been over them multiple times
(2:01:09) women do just as much damage with their m Missandry as whatever she considers
(2:01:15) misogyny to be and the truth is it's all just de demonization yeah i don't know why she's
() 
(2:01:21) crying i don't know i have no idea i'm not I'm not crying right now but yeah
(2:01:29) okay this seems very manipulative by the way i'm just pointing that out but yeah you're entitled to your beliefs mhm
(2:01:36) would you like to engage with uh uh the misogyny being worse than uh misandry
(2:01:44) um sure topic yeah i mean I I'll just read out the statistics that I have here
(2:01:51) um about violence against women and that's basically what my you know my
(2:01:59) belief that misogyny is worse misogyny kills and misandria noise is sort of a phrase that people say i think both
(2:02:05) definitely aren't healthy but um one in three women experience violence in the
(2:02:12) home or just generally in their lifetime world Health Organization 50% of women are murdered in 2017 were killed by an
(2:02:19) intimate partner united Nations um a lot of child brides um with victims being
(2:02:24) women married to older men as well as 71% of human trafficking victims being women um we often use for sexual
(2:02:30) exploitation purposes and that a lot of that is rooted in the belief that women are property and objects that men can do
(2:02:36) what they want with um and yeah so that's why I believe that misogyny is worse i think again though I will
(2:02:42) concede I think both can be harmful and can I just point out real quick that uh sexual liberation is a key cornerstone
(2:02:48) of feminism including only fans things like this and that's been linked heavily to sexual trafficking and still the left
(2:02:56) does everything they can to promote that women should be able to engage in prostitution even though it leads to
(2:03:02) those very same outcomes which is insane on top of that she says misogyny kills misandry and noise that's not true we
(2:03:08) look at uh post- divorce stats for suicidality for instance uh same thing
(2:03:14) even pre when it comes to men's health they do want to allow themselves higher rates right now I would still argue that
(2:03:19) that's mostly because they're better at it but also because and what I mean by that is that like women will basically
(2:03:26) not use they just won't use guns right and men use guns um but yeah I would say
(2:03:32) also when you we're talking about misogyny versus misandry what's really interesting about this is they'll often only point to the stat of death as
(2:03:39) though that is the only stat which is worth looking at you look at what's going on in society we also have to look
(2:03:45) at children the effects and outcomes of children the demonization of men through
(2:03:50) misandry often will lead to men or uh uh boys young girls things like that losing
(2:03:56) respect for men it also leads to men losing custody of their children which leads to bad outcomes for children like
(2:04:04) just be even if it were the case that I accepted all of her stats it it by the
(2:04:09) way that also proves that feminism it's not doing a good job protecting women literally failed its promise of protecting women but on top of that
(2:04:17) let's can we just point out that she doesn't bring up the outcomes for children ever they never bring up the
(2:04:23) outcomes for children which are completely and totally awful when we
(2:04:29) have these split family homes and the glorification of single motherhood which feminism has done they only point to the
(2:04:34) fact that well misogyny can lead to the unalive also can I just point out uh
(2:04:41) what about the fact that there's about you know a million women plus a year who
(2:04:46) murder men's children in the womb i just want to point that out while she says well this is basically Miss Andrew's
(2:04:52) just harmful harmless annoyance at the same time remember having a million abortions a year
(2:05:00) may I just ask were you I'm trying to Were you Were you listening okay all
() 
(2:05:05) right um I was listening okay do you wanna Sure
(2:05:10) um refute or counter i think that like being pro-choice it like the way that
(2:05:17) it's it's defined about taking life is always going to be open to interpretation i think people will think
(2:05:23) um you know different things about when life begins and so ultimately the crux of that it seems do you it seems like
(2:05:29) you believe in God do you yeah so um I think that because of that we will never see eye to eye because I don't consider
(2:05:36) it to be murder before a certain point like obviously like if the fetus is viable if you know like there are
(2:05:41) certain points where I only ever use secular arguments so even if it is the case of believe in God yeah i've only
(2:05:47) ever used secular arguments so what would your argument be um like that the case for sentience makes no sense and
(2:05:53) that scientifically the established scientific consensus the legitimate scientific consensus non- sociological
(2:05:59) consensus is that this is a human life at conception immediately that is the scientific consensus you can look at any
(2:06:05) source you want that's the scientific consensus so if that's the case right then we should treat it as though it's a
(2:06:11) human life sure yeah and I again I think that's going to vary from person to person um I think that there's a lot of
(2:06:18) people in the scientific community and again the scientific consensus does vary on when life begins it does not because
(2:06:24) the religious uh idea is the consensus does not vary there's no source you could ever look to and I'm willing I'm
(2:06:30) willing to be corrected right now live there is no source I've ever been able to find right which refuts that the
(2:06:36) scientific consensus is that human life begins at conception oh thank you there would be no other way to determine human
(2:06:41) life other than that it began at conception you wouldn't even be able to determine it another way but you can go
(2:06:47) ahead what does scientific consensus say when does human life begin um sure
(2:06:53) i'll
(2:06:58) wait so it's saying that there are three different perspectives the scientific
(2:07:04) philosophical and religious scientific most biologists agree that a new unique human organization comes into existence
(2:07:11) at fertilization so a human life at at conception at conception right but but
(2:07:17) they're saying that a new human organism but there's people that have different agreements that doesn't necessarily necessitate that that that doesn't mean
(2:07:23) life well what is life it's alive i mean that's that's it's um that's what I'm saying is it's different for everyone
(2:07:30) they're saying that the human organism forms at conception but that doesn't mean it's life well what is an organism is it alive i mean like they're talking
(2:07:37) about human life yeah okay but what Yeah what is life it would an organism would be alive right
(2:07:44) i mean but again there's a difference between human life and an organism don't you agree isn't Well if an organism is
(2:07:50) alive and it's a human organism then it's human life right how could it not be i mean yeah you can believe what you
(2:07:56) want i think just different people are always going to have different opinions on it and I I was just pointing out the scientific consensus and I was correct
(2:08:03) right scientific consensus by most biologists which would be consensus yes say that human life begins at conception
(2:08:09) right sure yeah so then what we're left with from the secular perspective is sentience and that really makes no sense
(2:08:16) that's it so I would always use a secular argument secularists can't determine when sentience begins since
(2:08:21) they can't determine when sentience begins there's no reason for us to assume it doesn't begin at conception of life okay yeah i I mean there's
(2:08:28) different arguments for like So I think your argument is more biological that makes sense um I understand your
(2:08:33) argument i mean there's different reasons people argue for being pro-choice and pro-life so pro-life
(2:08:39) pro-choice but um you know there's different ways of looking at it and I don't think we'll ever agree so I don't
(2:08:44) know um but yeah but good i like I enjoy hearing about your arguments and what you have to say so I've never been you
(2:08:52) know yeah I never heard that specific point so Kyla you mentioned that there were some topics you would have uh other
(2:08:59) topics you would have liked to speak on is there uh from your prompts would you like to bring any of those up or Yeah um
() 
(2:09:06) I just would you so do you really believe that out of the four components
(2:09:12) of the four principles of general feminism which is working to increase gender equality that's number one and
(2:09:19) expanding human choice number two how do you suppose that those two things could
(2:09:24) be problematic yeah let's start with um expanding human choice actually okay that's one of my favorite ones so you're
(2:09:32) not really for expanding human choice right like just only kind of I like you
(2:09:37) don't want me to have a choice to be able to drink and drive right uh sure yeah you don't want me to have a
(2:09:43) choice to stop at a stop sign like Sure yeah yeah like short of some like externalized
(2:09:49) emergency so what choices do you want me to be able to have let's start with those sure um anything related to agency
(2:10:00) um like within reason without harming others yeah yeah but I mean me drinking and driving doesn't harm others opportunity right um does me drinking
(2:10:07) driving actually harm others it can but everything I do can harm others right so
(2:10:13) that's that's a strange argument because when you're talking about freedom of choice and you say well we can limit this choice because it can do harm that
(2:10:20) would be everything so let me let me um clarify then okay expanding human choice
(2:10:26) such that it promotes autonomy and agency without infringing upon the
(2:10:32) rights of others or the safety of others yeah now you see why I was so specific about rights because it's definitionally
(2:10:39) part of what you believe right being specific is important so yes it's being specific is super important i was very
(2:10:44) specific about rights that's why I wanted to know where they came from because I looked at your definition which I wrote down earlier which was the
(2:10:51) four parts and I'll read it to you the parts if you don't believe that I wrote it down no I believe you i believe you
(2:10:56) you've definitely been paying attention so but you keep but you you kept on saying like I don't think that this is pertinent when we're talking about force
(2:11:02) doctrine and rights but the entirety of your second pillar of feminism revolves
(2:11:07) around choice and rights so you everybody should have a choice unless it expands to infringe on someone else's
(2:11:12) rights right like a living person yeah yeah like a living person okay we'll just we're going to leave abortion and
(2:11:18) all that aside we're just talking about we'll we'll just say like you're alive at least we'll agree you're alive at
(2:11:23) when you come out of the womb sure right we can agree to that so but here's the problem right it's like let's take
(2:11:30) something easy like guns for instance right um should I be able to own an
(2:11:35) AR-15 depends on who you ask in which state i'm asking you do I think you need an
(2:11:42) AR-15 that's not what I asked should I be able to own one should you be able to own an AR-15 that has Cuz there's
(2:11:47) specific types right there's like ways you can prevent the AR-15 from firing round i mean a fully automatic machine gun okay why are you taking away my
(2:11:55) choice um because like that would be an example of the specification that I made about how it infringes upon the safety
(2:12:00) of others okay what about a semi-automatic um that's a good question um I don't
(2:12:08) really know why anything that even that large and semi-automatic would be useful but I don't know a lot about AR-15s i
(2:12:15) understand i'm not trying to hold any potential ignorance you have about the operation of guns against your argument
(2:12:21) after all I can say tractors do a lot of damage and not know anything about tractors but still know they do damage
(2:12:26) right so I think that that's a legitimate argument for you to say i mean I know yes but yes yeah yeah well
(2:12:32) I'm just Well Dean well what is it chambered in then i mean my dad is like has a lot he has like a gun safe and he
(2:12:38) I grew up with him like shooting and stuff so do you know what what caliber an AR-15 shoots no I don't okay so I
(2:12:44) mean again I'm not familiar with AR-15s really but Yeah yeah uh so we would say like functionally you don't know too
(2:12:50) much about the product we're talking about i'm fine with that i was just pointing that out to be hypercharitable
(2:12:56) but how how is that considering the fact that I will never and almost nobody who
(2:13:01) ever owns an AR-15 will use one in a violent act why is it worth limiting our choice is that true oh yeah do you know
(2:13:09) for instance um almost all gun crime is committed with handguns and almost all
(2:13:15) of it is committed by one segment of the population with handguns when it comes to long guns that would be uh the black
(2:13:21) population mostly with handguns with handguns and then with shotguns is that what you're saying no no with rifles or
(2:13:28) shotguns you're more likely to be beaten to death with hands and feet than than a rifle or a shotgun h including an AR-15
(2:13:34) that's if we took all of the mass things i can't say what they are but the mass things that you know happen if we took
(2:13:41) all even all of those into account you're still more likely to get beaten to death with hands and feet interesting than you are to So but how does that
(2:13:48) expand my choice then though that I that this is an operational thing that I want
(2:13:54) and somebody definitely wants to sell it to me and I want to buy it why are you limiting my choice yeah I mean I think
(2:14:01) that's a good question and I feel like it's very um philosophical at that point um I do think like the stigma around
(2:14:07) owning guns like I I'm definitely for stronger i just don't understand why anyone would need to own like a fully
(2:14:13) like just the fact that if anyone got their hands on it it just is scary um I don't know why anyone would need to be
(2:14:18) able to shoot that many rounds that quickly well you believe in rights right yes the right to own guns I do believe
(2:14:24) is important yeah so that would be a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear
(2:14:29) arms shall not be infringed right that's our second amendment right yeah no I mean and that is a right sure and wouldn't it be infringing i'm not trying
(2:14:35) to take it away like yeah well you're trying to limit my choice with that right and you haven't explained how
(2:14:41) exactly it infringes on anybody that I own an AR-15 i mean there have been Yeah
(2:14:46) i mean I think the most notable example wasn't it i mean I I'll have to specifically check but the one in I can
(2:14:52) grant any like mass you know homicide event that may have happened with an AR-15 sure what does it have to do with
(2:14:58) me um right i think the the point being I think is to determine if something
(2:15:05) infringes upon the rights of others or or the safety of others should be uh is
(2:15:11) something that is up for like debate and so I'm not here to tell you like what does or doesn't what is or isn't like
(2:15:18) I'm not like a governing agency you should probably ask somebody who knows more about that but it's the second pillar the second pillar of your ideology right talking about human
(2:15:24) agency in terms of like not like the right like I'm specifically talking about the ability for someone to get the
(2:15:30) job they want like you you immediately brought it back to guns i'm talking about the ability to have the equal opportunities to like have someone take
(2:15:36) care of your children while you go to work and stuff so that you can advance your career like I think that's fair i think that's a fair a fair point to make
(2:15:42) so if like a woman wants to get a job at a firm where a man controls the firm doesn't want to hire because she's a
(2:15:47) woman you would say that that's infringing on her choice sure yeah okay i think that that's completely fair if
(2:15:53) it is the case though it's like I don't know enough about guns to be able to like accurately come up with something does that make sense yeah yeah well we
(2:15:59) could use anything that you could ever know about gun gunwise and just use that instead of an AR but the point is is
(2:16:06) that if I wanted to have a firearm of my choice Yeah right and it wouldn't actually hurt anybody the expansive of
(2:16:12) choice seems like you're saying that that business owner doesn't have choice because she has the right right however
(2:16:19) if it harms him and his business it's the same argument you're making for the AR-15 you're saying because other people
(2:16:27) may do bad thing with this right may may do you know like horrible things some
(2:16:33) people may the vast majority of people do not right we need to govern their choice in order to have safety for
(2:16:39) society or safety for individuals right how is it though that if you tell people who they have to hire you're not also
(2:16:45) limiting choice how how how does that work it's not saying who you have to
(2:16:51) hire it's saying who you cannot discriminate against like you know the 1964 Civil Rights Act
(2:17:01) i think that racism is designed to combat or that legislation is designed to combat racism and sexism
(2:17:09) versus like so the the protection is more for the person like there's more
(2:17:14) protecting being done for the person who is being hired than there is harm being
(2:17:20) done to the business by being told they can't be racist so that's how it outweighs it can you demonstrate it
(2:17:26) sure um so if I'm a woman and I'm equally qualified as a man and I go in
(2:17:32) to get a job and I you know they're telling me that I can't be hired because I'm a woman then that causes immense
(2:17:39) psych psychological and financial harm right for the company to have to hire me instead of the man even though I'm
(2:17:45) equally qualified that does not actually harm them in any way because I have the
(2:17:51) same qualifications and abilities as the man does okay i want to go buy a fully does that even
(2:17:57) harm the company i don't know well I think it does because well because it limits the choices and demoralizes the
(2:18:03) agencies at the top who may not want to hire you for whatever arbitrary reason but like let's say specifically it's
(2:18:09) like they don't think women are good in like at the job sure let's just say that that's true you think that should be pro
(2:18:14) protected well I mean from their view it's going to hurt them right like there's no doubt that that's going to hurt them you may not agree with the
(2:18:21) reasoning why it hurts them but you can't it's going to hurt them subjectivity versus like you're saying
(2:18:26) for the subject it's all subjective there right no but the subjective No I mean not necess like the objective there
(2:18:32) is an objective truth that discrimination is harmful wait a second you don't agree wait a second hang on a
(2:18:37) second then that would also be an objective truth then that if people are forced to do things they don't want to
(2:18:43) do like hire people they don't want to hire then I would make the same argument that you think that's as bad as racism
(2:18:49) did I say as bad or objectively harmful okay so let's so so when I say like I
(2:18:54) want to go buy an an AR-15 and you say no you can't right that's doing the
(2:19:00) exact same thing i don't understand like what's the distinction here it sounds like you're telling me what I have to do
(2:19:07) yeah I mean I think some people some people see it that way i I do have an interest in public safety though so um I
(2:19:13) think that sometimes um you know certain actions if they're racist sexist harmful
(2:19:21) cause a lot of psychological or financial or other physical harm I don't think that those should be protected
(2:19:26) over the beliefs of the inferiority of a person are you aware of that based off
(2:19:31) of a characteristic they can't control yeah are you aware of how many DEI laws there are
(2:19:37) i mean I know there's a roll back now that Trump is in office but sure go
(2:19:44) ahead and explain yeah I mean um when it comes to hiring practices or
(2:19:50) non-discriminatory practices right there's hundreds and hundreds of laws of both the local state and municipal and
(2:19:56) at the federal level right hundreds and hundreds and hundreds which govern this behavior m you're telling me that none
(2:20:02) of those which all of them are designed to expand choice are infringements upon the
(2:20:08) hiring practices of people want to hire who they want like if I wanted to have a male only firm because I just wanted one
(2:20:13) why is that actually a problem right i mean I guess to your point there
(2:20:19) are like women onlyly gyms you know and yeah if I want a male only firm and literally I'm public about it i'm like I
(2:20:26) just don't want to hire women cuz I don't really like them that much if I just said that like outright I just
(2:20:32) don't really like them that much and I just don't want to work with them and it's my company i [ __ ] own it i built it i invented everything what is
(2:20:39) actually the problem with that why can't I just do that um why do you want to Why do you want to like infringe on my
(2:20:44) choices like the 1964 like Civil Rights Act is probably going to be a problem for you i don't Well let's Well well I
(2:20:52) mean do you know what freedom of association is freedom to associate with who you want yeah do you think that
(2:20:57) that's an inherent right um I think for corporations corporations
(2:21:04) aren't people so I don't corporations are people what else would they be they shouldn't be people i think that's where
(2:21:10) we disagree because in a some cases the Supreme Court has upheld that the corporations like have the same rights
(2:21:15) of people so if you own a company and you're religious then you don't have to pay for like reproductive services or birth control right what else would you
(2:21:21) couldn't classify them as anything but people people are the things which run corporations corporations are people i I
(2:21:27) disagree um I think that corporations are entities they are run by people but I think that they should be held to
(2:21:33) different standards is there any conscious entity that you can think of that talks and can speak like you and me
(2:21:39) and make decisions like you and me that's not people um yeah sure uh no no so that I mean if
(2:21:48) that's the case they're making the same types of decisions that you and I are making why wouldn't they be assumed to be
(2:21:54) people because they have different um sort of way like standards of operation
(2:22:00) they have laws they have to follow that are different from people like in terms of the government's eyes i believe it
(2:22:05) should be considered not a person i think it there are just it's fundamentally the way that it operates
(2:22:11) is different i mean it's not one it's like a conglomerate of things and um people who work in a company so like so
(2:22:17) I don't have a corporation let's say then and I have a private business practice right where I'm a landscaper
(2:22:23) and I just there's a woman who comes in she's definitely qualified for the job and there's a man who comes in who's
(2:22:28) slightly less qualified for the job but I just kind of want to hire him anyway because I just don't really like women
(2:22:34) why is that not something I should have the freedom to choose for myself why i mean I just think we're operating at a
(2:22:40) different moral capacity i mean a lot of my things that I say are rooted in morals and you're making yours vote like
(2:22:46) in sort of like laws i'm asking you for the moral argument i'm telling you that
(2:22:51) I believe it's wrong to make someone feel ashamed and not hire somebody and
(2:22:56) give them different outcome based off of their race or sex or But you don't believe it's wrong to tell people that they must do a thing they don't want to
(2:23:02) do not at all no I don't because I Because So then it's not about choice then is it i suppose if you want to make
() 
(2:23:10) the argument you're making then no then it's not really about choice okay so the second pillar of feminism is uh not just
(2:23:17) debunked it like so fast just like that it's pretty Yeah it's pretty false you just said it's not really about choice
(2:23:22) it's really about an agenda right what was the third pillar of feminism um well
(2:23:27) I think we're getting close to the end is this what we want to talk about for the last you know few minutes well we
(2:23:33) have another 30 minutes sure it's 5:59 right now we have All
() 
(2:23:40) right well I might just have to take another break because I'm not feeling so hot is that all right um there but I'll
(2:23:46) tell you what I would like to talk about next though uh one thing here I think it would be fair i just told you I have
(2:23:51) medical issues though like I genuinely need to take a break hold on i'm fine with you taking the breaks okay but
(2:23:56) given the frequency and the duration of said breaks I think it's reasonable to ask for an
(2:24:02) additional 10 15 minutes to make up for the breaks that have uh occurred thus
(2:24:09) far sure I will give you 10 minutes more we can go till 6:40 but other than that I truly cannot stay longer like I have
(2:24:18) problems like Yeah no look do you want to go ahead and take the break and we'll let some chats come through okay
(2:24:32) uh all right uh we're gonna Here's what we're going to do guys uh since we are getting close to the end of the show
(2:24:39) make sure you get your messages in now there's quite a few andrew if you can just stay for just a sec uh there's
(2:24:45) there's quite a few uh we'll try to get them all in uh we'll we'll do a bit more
(2:24:51) so streamlabs.com/ whatever $99 TTS also like the video if you're
(2:24:56) enjoying the stream i need to do a quick sidebar with Andrew here really quick i'm gonna put it on intro screen give me 10 15 seconds we'll be right back
(2:25:38) all
(2:25:50) right sorry sorry about that guys we are back though i'm going to read a couple chats here uh Riptor the problem with
(2:25:56) feminism is that men overwhelmingly allow allow women to redefine what masculinity should be while women often
(2:26:03) concede no such ground to men who have a preference for how women should behave
(2:26:09) how is this equality uh since she's gone andrew do you want to quickly like Yeah very quickly um I this is why I always
(2:26:16) tie them to virtues and thus far nobody has argued this definition it's a big
(2:26:22) defeater for feminist ideology as well all right Riptor thank you for that we have Lucas here it is truth is the
(2:26:28) little lady is weak and intellectually feeble the other and otherwise mired in eco chamber with her views never
(2:26:34) challenged just a hunch here love but an oral argument in front of Scotus is probably not in the cards for you now
(2:26:40) bring out the therapy dog um okay uh you know I Lucas I you maybe wanted that
(2:26:46) directed at her but she she did have to step away for for a moment but the audience uh did get to see it and uh we
(2:26:53) do have a bit of a time limit here so I'm going to see if there's any Streamlabs messages that we can let come
(2:27:00) through get the super bring in the super chats do it let's see here one sec guys
(2:27:07) there's a lot so I'll try to get through to all of them uh one sec ah shoot
(2:27:14) uh we have USMConated $100
(2:27:21) big fan of Andrew even though I'm older than him member at Crucible this lady
(2:27:26) hasn't had an argument since you hacked her phone reception lola
(2:27:32) yeah we uh you know we've got what what Faraday cage in the studio so they can't
(2:27:38) it allows our signal to get out but uh All right thank you for that christopher Murphy thank you or Christopher
(2:27:45) Christopher Murphy is about to come through USMC thank you christopher Murphy donated
(2:27:50) $100 i'm a proud Crucible member you and Rachel are finally getting the
(2:27:55) recognition you two deserve keep it up brian don't apologize for being a good
(2:28:01) host you're the man i appreciate it Christopher thank you i I'm trying to be as fair as I can um all right here I'll
(2:28:08) let the I've actually had someone offer to pay me because I'm assuming if I leave early you won't pay me so but I've
() 
(2:28:14) had someone in my comments offer to pay me the amount that I was paid to be here so I'm going to go because I again I
(2:28:20) have medical problems i'm not feeling good what if somebody in our chat offers to pay you more
(2:28:30) do you think they would yeah well they would pay me and then
(2:28:36) Yes if someone offered I would stay and I would cry on camera but I don't know if they will
() 
(2:28:42) this is why we have the wage gap this is literally why we have the wage gap ladies and gentlemen but I highly
(2:28:48) doubt that someone will offer that i wonder so they're they're offering you
(2:28:55) uh they're offering me 50 so So if you stay for another two hours what what would
(2:29:01) that cost oh my god like 500 bucks no my god more on
(2:29:08) top like probably double
(2:29:14) double uh 500 or so thousand the original okay double the original so I think we would need in order would you
(2:29:20) actually if if it was doubled would you if it was actually doubled I would stay cuz again I am like I do have problem
(2:29:28) like so I could probably stay a little longer two hours i would just have to
(2:29:33) beyond so we're talking 8 uh 8:30 sure then I would I would need like triple
(2:29:40) because I I like Troy triple you're a tough negotiator Kylie you're a tough negotiator again this girl over here
(2:29:47) tough negotiator i genuinely do have shoes though like I'm not That's not a lie so I just don't like to talk about it but I like I have a hard time yeah
(2:29:57) like I could like What is the issue anyway i don't really like to talk about it but I've had like
() 
(2:30:04) concussions and stuff like that so concussions you are you brain TBI it's
(2:30:10) well yeah I mean traumatic brain injury yeah it was a traumatic it was it's like I get like really bad headaches and like
(2:30:16) do you want we have like breathing Tylenol or ibuprofen we could give you
(2:30:22) but I don't really want to go too much into it okay um
(2:30:28) but um I have had someone offer me but I just don't think this is a good environment so I think um I'll just take
() 
(2:30:34) the offer that the person has given me of the original amount and I'm just going to head out i think so
(2:30:41) i just um I think my health and is more important than whatever you've offered me which is not much so I mean I don't
(2:30:49) think it's fair you know we've been very generous here at the whatever podcast i don't know if that's a fair categorization so you said the double so
(2:30:56) if somebody does essentially uh somebody want to send in like an Ethereum and and again like this isn't
(2:31:03) really my network so I I don't think anyone's going to offer it so but I guess you know nothing is impossible um
(2:31:10) are there any takers in the chat who want to see this wait let me ask the chat why don't I pull the chat chat does
(2:31:16) anybody want another two uh uh 2 hours on top of so like

(2:32:30) wasn't putting my medical issue aside for money i didn't know how long this was going to be that was my fault I will admit but I appreciate like learning new
(2:32:37) perspectives i was hoping this would be a more calm and demure experience because I've been trying to be more you

(2:33:31) statement and a few chats yeah I will stay for that but can we
(2:33:37) make it five minutes okay 10 minutes that's fair that seems fair i I mean I'm I literally just here just We got
(2:33:44) Leonitis here listen to Leonitis then Andrew is going to give his closing statement leonitis donated $100 kylie curious age of kids you teach
(2:33:53) also what is a woman also are women as a group oppressed in the USA if so how are
(2:34:01) you as a woman oppressed if so how and are men as a group oppressed and you
(2:34:07) said you're an educator are you teaching like are you tutoring i'm a private tutor and I'm also a substitute teacher
(2:34:13) and I teach in you know three primary high schools in Chicago um
(2:34:18) so you teach like uh elementary school kids no high school oh high school okay uh he asked "What is a woman?" Quick
(2:34:24) answer if you can i think um a woman is someone who is I mean it depends like
(2:34:30) biologically female is different from being a woman but someone who is a woman is someone who's
(2:34:36) characteristically a person who um you know associates themselves with femininity and that is open to
(2:34:41) interpretation of who wants to identify as one if I may just ask one clarifying question can a uh can a female become a
(2:34:48) male or can a male become a female like biologically speaking I believe like you
(2:34:54) know the sexes of male and female but I think if a person wants to be a woman or a man absolutely yeah uh and then uh are
() 
(2:35:00) women as a group oppressed in the USA your answer um I think it's possible but
(2:35:06) I really need to leave can may I just at least Can you stay for Andrew's clothes no I don't look we're not we're not
(2:35:12) kidnapping you we're just I'm just asking if you can at least stay you have to clarify you're not kidding yeah yeah
(2:35:17) but you said you could stay five minutes come on i'm leaving i I mean what no I'm going
() 
(2:35:24) but I hope you guys have a good day thank you for the experience
(2:35:31) are you oppressed do you want to just answer that you don't need to say into the mic just yell
(2:35:37) it out maybe
() 
(2:35:43) that's my closing statement but for a champagne pop for a champagne
(2:35:49) pop you guys were here for this for a champagne pop I will send you the Andrew Wilson notepad with a special note right
(2:35:56) here for all my feminist um little notes that I took along with the complete and
(2:36:01) total dominant victory i win i [ __ ] win just saying it does say I just just
(2:36:08) want to point I win i think that was a pretty I mean that's a pretty decisive victory i'd like to
(2:36:15) congratulate you on your victory as the moderator pretty happy pretty happy about it not upset a bit the thing is is
(2:36:21) like um I Why Why are they so [ __ ] you know these are the [ __ ]
(2:36:28) ass kicking oh women can [ __ ] be in the military and ninja up men they
(2:36:33) [ __ ] You get in a debate with them and suddenly they're [ __ ] crying and [ __ ] you barely say anything barely say anything
(2:36:39) [ __ ] [ __ ] tired of it dude tired of it [ __ ] chirro on the one hand and then
(2:36:46) on the other hand they're so sensitive they just break immediately because you're just talking about you're having a [ __ ] debate what does she think a
(2:36:52) debate with you know what it is i know what it is they think a debate is they hit the mute button on TikTok and then
(2:36:58) just talk to talk at you that's what they think a [ __ ] debate is
(2:37:04) and you were there was like a both of you were doing it a little like uh
(2:37:10) mocking each other which is fair it's a debate it's rhetoric it's rhetoric i you
(2:37:16) know look uh she had a bit of a tone the men do it the men do hey we want
(2:37:22) equality was there not a man yesterday who we were going back and forth lots of mocking going on [ __ ] like that well
(2:37:28) that guy on Thursday too yeah and did it look like Did it look like anybody was going quiet go
(2:37:37) well you know what's interesting Andrew you've raised this point before is that you know you're treating them as equals
(2:37:45) because you when you're debating a man so you conduct yourself in the same way
(2:37:51) exactly the same way and so you're giving her equality basically i'm You You tend
(2:37:58) to word this a little better than I do i'm I'm treating her exactly like I would treat a man which is exactly what she demands I do
(2:38:05) which is wild to me and you know we've had so many debates now nobody can say any different nobody could ever accuse
(2:38:11) Andrew Wilson of not being the same universally with men and women and the the thing is is like look at the
(2:38:16) reaction and there's and they they pretend that they want give me a [ __ ] break they the
(2:38:23) like a [ __ ] cheap chair i barely even pushed on the world view i barely even pushed on she had 10 topics i had one
(2:38:30) topic we get to my topic first the rest of it's going to be a critique back and what happens folds right away [ __ ]
(2:38:37) ridiculous andrew let me ask you uh can you ask the audience to like the video
(2:38:42) we need to like We need likes on the ladies and gentlemen especially those of you watching live from the Crucible who right now are putting W's in the chat
(2:38:49) and you better get the [ __ ] over here on whatever and put W's in the chat here as well please like the video and send in
(2:38:56) just hundreds and hundreds of dollars for the kindness of Brian he did by the way on his own dime fly me out here he
(2:39:02) did take care of the hotel rooms we do want to we do want to we do want to play the kickback game remember the
(2:39:08) Crucible's motto is always we take care of the people who take care of us thank you Andrew appreciate that and uh by the
(2:39:15) way I just you know I was getting a little heat in the chat at the beginning of the show when I was kind of trying to
(2:39:22) mo trying my best to it's an impossible it's an impossible position for Brian to be in for those of you who think well
(2:39:28) that's not really fair or Brian's being too nice or something like this brian's job is to keep the debate on course it's
(2:39:35) a way harder job than you think when you have such ideological distinctions you're trying to keep the peace cut him
(2:39:41) a little slack i've been in his chair hundreds of times not that chair but been in the moderator chair hundreds of
(2:39:48) times and I'm telling you it's a harder job than you think guys if you want get in some chats here uh $100 TTS if you
(2:39:55) want uh maybe we'll uh if you're fine with it Andrew we we'll probably try to wrap this earlier than we have been
(2:40:02) usually but maybe we'll lower the TTS a little bit let some audience questions come through let them roll ma'am yeah
(2:40:07) and by the way I I I I win oh were you playing hangman or no oh you win yeah well that was the four-letter that was
(2:40:13) the four letter was going to be I win i thought it was clever here I'm going to read pretty good for a guy with an average IQ against a 150 IQ you know
(2:40:21) what's funny actually Andrew the that woman on Twitter who was who she challenged you to do a IQ test an IQ
(2:40:28) test yeah and Brian contacted her it was Jiggly and said "Okay I'll we'll we'll
(2:40:33) do it." He would get a person in here who was unbiased to give the IQ test and guess who didn't want to do one
(2:40:41) yeah we're She said you know I've been waiting on her to try to give me a date
(2:40:46) she's not going to do She's not going to do an IQ test because she was a DEI hire we have Kakashi thank for the super chat
(2:40:53) thanks to Andrew and Brian for pressing feminist women and men for their weak world views from the outside looking in
(2:40:59) seems like what these debates are asking feminists to do is uphold uh world views to a standard sometimes the answer is
(2:41:05) not it depends it's relative thank you Kakashi for that lenny thanks for the gifted membership appreciate it thank
(2:41:10) you thank you if guys if you want let's get it in by the way to once again the
(2:41:16) whatever audience for being kind enough to host me it's always a pleasure to see you guys um I know that there's a
(2:41:23) there's a bit of crosspollination where you guys come over and chat with me in the Discord from time to time i really do appreciate
(2:41:28) that all right here's what we're going to do guys we'll do if you we'll do like Q&A for a little bit we're going to
(2:41:34) lower it to a $69 TTS give me a sec to get that going i'll let some chats come through here maybe Andrew can answer
(2:41:41) some of them and I do apologize i know some of you guys directed these chats at her but she left nothing I can do but
(2:41:47) I'll let them come through thank you Jason appreciate it jason Castle donated $100 a hostile environment what are you
(2:41:56) implying that you feel threatened by Andrew and Brian because they are asking questions you really are Bos you are
(2:42:03) trying to hurt their reputation real Bos well and Brian did every Do you know why Brian tried to extend that he was trying
(2:42:10) to extend it so that she could meet her agreement so that he could pay her out that was the ultimate [ __ ] kindness
(2:42:16) he was trying to extend it to make sure that she met her into the obligation and she just refused she just adamantly
(2:42:22) refused in fact told Brian "Stuff your stuff stuff what our end is in our deal
(2:42:27) somebody else offered me a higher bid i bid you a due." And it's like you think
(2:42:32) "Well Brian why is Brian trying to keep her here?" Well he's just trying to make sure that she upholds her end of the of
(2:42:38) the the contract right yeah and not I mean not to mention also uh you know we
(2:42:44) have we've had a lot of uh scheduled things for Andrew so far but we had this
(2:42:49) scheduled for him today he flew all the way from Michigan you know the flight the hotel all that
(2:42:56) not to mention his preparation for the debate which Andrew does significant
(2:43:01) preparation for the shows and don't want wasted time and money for for either of
(2:43:06) us so that's just Yeah anyways um we have Michael G here i live for the rage
(2:43:12) quit now we get quality bro time that's right uh her asking the moderator she
(2:43:18) was a if she could leave is proof her worldview shattered the patriarchy wins
(2:43:23) again and the second the sec I can tell you the exact moment it was one of you guys can clip it the exact moment was when I said "How is that not you
(2:43:29) appealing to the patriarchy?" And the the thing that she said is she went through it and she was like "Well it is
(2:43:35) true that we have to appeal to the government which is mostly run by men and then went like this." And that
(2:43:41) was it that's when it shattered just so you guys know you can look that up i took a little note in my notepad it was
(2:43:48) right then that it clicked i should actually I've got Patrice there
(2:43:53) i should actually put a black crystal black crystal yes yeah that's appreciate that i'll just leave
(2:43:59) this one here all right there crystals the pink the pink one seems a little gendered Brian you know that yeah that
(2:44:06) seems a little bit gendered uh All right we have uh Thank you Michael for that appreciate it uh let me
(2:44:13) I need to get everything changed but I'll try to get these uh coming through here one moment guys and guys if you're
(2:44:20) enjoying the stream once again like the video we have Christopher Murphy for the fund christopher Murphy donated $100 i
(2:44:27) tried i tried the fund well it's going to go into the Brian back pocket fund which he deserves he took um you know he
(2:44:34) he he spent uh several for those of you who don't know let me give you a little bit of backstory brian has spent several
(2:44:42) weeks several weeks in fact it was over a month um you know presetting these up
(2:44:48) in order to meet with my schedule appropriately so that everybody can kind of converge at the same time uh for the
(2:44:55) purposes of getting these debates done the panels done this and that it's a lot of work you know what I mean it's a lot
(2:45:01) of work and you can imagine flying people from all over the country from different locations into one location
(2:45:06) setting them up with hotels airplane tickets uh all of that it's a ton of work you know what I mean so credit
(2:45:13) where credit's due thank you man we uh you know a month in advance all of these were planned and so far I got to say
(2:45:20) they've gone pretty well yeah these have been some really good shows and uh yeah there's a lot that goes into doing the
(2:45:27) guest booking and you know there's people who are in they cancel got to bring somebody else in and uh well
(2:45:34) especially the the and you've probably encountered this because you request to debate people it's uh it's difficult to
(2:45:41) get left-leaning Democrat feminist people to step outside their uh their
(2:45:48) mute button yeah so it's difficult to get it's difficult to get uh opposition
(2:45:53) who will debate uh who will actually show up and debate um and he he's right
(2:45:58) about that not only is he right about this but let me give you um an interesting example so you guys have
(2:46:05) been live with me many times during the Tik Tok invasions you might as well call them the mute Andrew invasions because
(2:46:10) the second I make a point muted and then overtalking what happened here was immediately I can tell you how this went
(2:46:18) it was this idea of social dominance so the idea started with like you will not do this and the idea of me laughing and
(2:46:24) scoffing at the very idea that you're going to govern how I debate that was it
(2:46:29) the second it was the realization is well I can't control the tone i can't mute i can't threaten i can't abuse
(2:46:38) that's when it was over right and so then the world view collapses shortly after there because you you don't have
(2:46:44) any control anymore over what the opponent's asking or what the debate um
(2:46:50) you know is over where I take it or where you take it is no longer specifically up to you this whole thing
(2:46:57) all of this by the way just so that you know was about one thing wasn't about no chick being [ __ ] sick don't be stupid
(2:47:04) it wasn't about no [ __ ] health issues don't be stupid it was about one thing and that was I want control and I don't
(2:47:11) have it and that's it and for any of you who wanted to know what feminist ideology is really like in front of a
(2:47:17) patriarch you just saw it and well in front not a patriarch but in front of the patriarchy right in front of anybody
(2:47:24) who won't cowtow to a feminist that's actually what usually happens and then they go appeal to simps and the simps
(2:47:30) need to come beat me up and do this to me you know what I mean that's how they actually run their um their ideology
(2:47:36) their ideological worldviews their NOS's all their bull that's how they run it
(2:47:41) all right guys we've gotten the TTS lowered $69 TTS on that point though
(2:47:46) Andrew um do you think some of that was um performative manipulation of course
(2:47:55) of course but it starts with this idea the idea was like "You will do this."
(2:48:02) And the second the second there's no cowtowing and I say "No I'm not going to
(2:48:07) do that i'm going to have a legitimate debate like I always do." That's it
(2:48:12) right what do you mean i can't threaten i can't coers i can't browbeat i can't
(2:48:18) do this and then the second that Now what happens when all of that fails what happened the water works the final form
(2:48:24) of manipulation oh I can't coers i can't threaten i can't do this this guy doesn't give a [ __ ] he doesn't care if I
(2:48:30) rage quit right he does he doesn't care he's here to have a debate then came the manipulation that's the waterworks
(2:48:38) i health you know and I'll cry but what did she say i'll cry on camera for enough money don't tell me it's not
(2:48:44) [ __ ] manipulation i'll cry on camera for enough money brian did she say that yeah she said "I'll stay and cry on camera if it's for $1,000." Oh man
(2:48:53) that's wild it's unbelievable and like you guys you guys you know exactly what I'm tell you see how many hundreds of
(2:48:58) these have you seen now with me and feminists it's always the same [ __ ] if they can't control or dominate right
(2:49:05) they lose their [ __ ] minds uh Kaibaka again I'm sorry i don't know why Streamlabs keeps doing this uh
(2:49:14) she looks like she gifted 20 yo Kaiaka thank you 20 gifted

(2:50:00) Lucas here on Streamlabs thank you Lucas lucas donated $100 appreciate it man
(2:50:05) one/ho screw the tone policing and her playing the crying woman card toughen up
(2:50:11) buttercup dot there are a [ __ ] ton of female attorneys that are total beasts do you think Camille Vasquez Johnny Depp
(2:50:19) to which he continues and it's hard for me to argue with that because I've had feminists across from me who go right
(2:50:26) for the jugular and they're brutal debaters and I'm like you know [ __ ] yeah here we go you know what I mean
(2:50:32) let's [ __ ] do this what a [ __ ] disappointment what a [ __ ]
(2:50:37) disappointment right right and you know what she she could have just made
(2:50:42) arguments yeah she could have just made arguments i would have loved that that would have been good but half the time it was tone policing and yeah so uh we
(2:50:51) have Lucas with his continued message here thank you lucas donated $100 two/ dot dot would have wimpered
(2:50:59) out like this manipulative snowflake you should be embarrassed the world has no
(2:51:04) obligation to coddle you and cater to your weak constitution especially when you're saying that women are not in a
(2:51:10) position of privilege but are instead the oppressed class and that they deserve the equality with men you can't
(2:51:15) even sit across with one and have a [ __ ] debate you I you guys you don't even have a perspective because it's on
(2:51:21) camera this table is really long across right we're not that close to each other
(2:51:28) at all like there's no there's just nothing you know what I mean like the
(2:51:34) whole thing is [ __ ] cope that's why the water works happened do you really believe does Do any of you really
(2:51:40) believe that suddenly this chick forgot she had a medical condition that she didn't previously disclose suddenly
(2:51:47) she's crying because of this medical condition and on top of that didn't do any research on how long these debates
(2:51:53) go even though Brian asked her "Haven't you done research?" And she's like "Yeah the last two have been about 5 hours
(2:51:58) plus." So she knew it's [ __ ] it's [ __ ] [ __ ] mhm also just I want to
(2:52:05) add one point of clarification i originally reached out back I reached
(2:52:11) out to her March 28th of this year so that's almost two months ago uh asking
(2:52:18) if she would like to come do a debate on our podcast um and let's see yeah and I
(2:52:26) think we we locked it in uh well how does that feel for an almost 100 IQ guy
(2:52:32) if I'm lucky on a good day against a 150 IQer Brian how that must all of those
(2:52:38) degrees and all that big IQ you know to some guy who [ __ ] is drinking some
(2:52:44) mixed vodka and soda drink very masculine drink you have there in your hand that That wasn't like a shot was it
(2:52:51) Brian that wasn't a shot at [ __ ] not a shot it is a masculine it's very
(2:52:57) masculine drink uh we got Shaw here coming in hey Chaw
(2:53:02) thank you man your XD donated $69 what are the odds she was soliciting
(2:53:08) excuses to leave each break she took seems pretty high to me i suppose in
(2:53:13) fairness to her having your world view dismantled is pretty There's no way he's not right i've been there oh well a
(2:53:19) couple things you remember when her phone went off i could I guarantee you she probably didn't end up using the
(2:53:26) excuse but it was like "Oh somebody's calling me." Uh you know you ever like
(2:53:31) "How do I get out of a situation okay call me in 10 minutes tell me I got to go." What happened was made the excuse
(2:53:36) to go into the bathroom to make the text and then Right that's Yeah that the
(2:53:42) whole thing was Yeah it was set up for sure he's right tell me he's not right well and what's weird though is who
(2:53:48) would offer to like the conversation was pretty tame it was it was especially
(2:53:53) look maybe at the beginning it was what even at the beginning when there was a a modeicum of heat it wouldn't have
(2:54:01) warranted I need to leave but then that passed the conversation she was losing
(2:54:08) the debate but the conversation was fine yeah conversation was fine no need to leave at that point but whatever uh
(2:54:15) we'll let the rest of these chats come through we have But you know what she'll do i tan donated $100
(2:54:24) wait wait she can handle teaching at three Chicago high schools but the
(2:54:29) slightest push back and she gets crippling headaches what a load of Oh total [ __ ] that's a good That's a
(2:54:35) really good total [ __ ] well not just that bro like Sancho let's point this out that
(2:54:42) um Brian was extremely charitable and we came down on her end came down on her
(2:54:48) end and was like "No this is going to go uh Andrew you're going to A B C and D."
(2:54:53) And I was like "Okay I'll conform to the moderator." Now that's part of my agreement part of my agreement when I come on the show is that yes I will
(2:54:59) adhere to moderation and I've always been pretty good about doing that there's sometimes where I get maybe upset with the moderator as every
(2:55:07) debater is going to do right but I that's part of the agreement is to adhere to moderation that's what makes a
(2:55:12) debate fair there is no [ __ ] way no way that this wasn't a setup dude where
(2:55:18) she was setting up an exit strategy when she realized she was losing and losing quickly m and with the phone also this
(2:55:27) do you think that uh and it hasn't come up too much in previous debates we
(2:55:33) should disallow phone usage do you think that that like neither person can use their phone i think cuz
(2:55:40) she was on it i think it's fair to I'm like I'm okay when people are bringing up stats and she's like let's pull up
(2:55:46) the stats you got to have some way to do that in a legitimate debate you should be able to pull up the stats that you
(2:55:52) want but what happened was I crushed her with the stats immediately and what what
(2:55:57) got her immediately was she was like "Well I just looked those up and I can't find them anywhere do you know how long
(2:56:04) that comprehensive analysis is?" And I'm like "There's no [ __ ] way." And one of the chatters points out he's like "Go
(2:56:09) to page this this this everything Andrew is saying is right there." Oh but I looked she didn't look what she was not
(2:56:17) prepared for the argument and neither are most of these sociologists who are feminists they're never prepared for the
(2:56:22) argument that these people are [ __ ] wrong about their stats they're wrong about the things that they're saying
(2:56:28) they're not telling you the truth about any of this feminism has led to far more
(2:56:33) abuse of women than anything a patriarchal system could ever even envision
(2:56:40) so you think allow the phones i think you should allow the phones for the purposes of stats i don't think that
(2:56:46) like chat gpting an argument is legit yeah but I think that if we're doing statistics or we're pulling up studies I
(2:56:54) need to be able to look at what she's referencing she needs to like I'm fine with that got it got some chat that
(2:57:00) seems I mean that seems fair right intel Wild donated $69 the only thing $150 about this chick
(2:57:07) is the weight scale when she I guess this is the roast the roast
(2:57:14) session all right uh what do you think about this though in we could say and I don't know if this
(2:57:20) is too little or wouldn't be helpful but instead of phones no phones each person
(2:57:25) can request to look up to three uh studies or should there not be so the
(2:57:32) way the way that I always did it was I would always say take your three best support studies you're going to
(2:57:37) reference and then send those in before the show i'll send them to the to your debate adversary he'll send you his yeah
(2:57:44) then both of you can have your reputations but anything external those reputations are unacceptable okay got it
(2:57:50) does that make sense yeah no that makes sense that makes a lot of sense that's how because my studies come up a lot yep
(2:57:56) so what is uh when you're debating somebody is
(2:58:02) there an argument like if somebody does say well where's the study isn't there an argument that you can make like I
(2:58:09) don't need a study of course you can use you can use logical argumentation you can use uh even intuitive argumentation
(2:58:15) you can use all sorts of different arguments and you can also say well it's an appeal to authority anyway the second
(2:58:21) she said "You're right sociology suffers from a replication crisis you're right that it's about 60 70%." That's enough
(2:58:28) intuitive evidence for us to [ __ ] dismiss anything we're reading you can imagine if I was like "Here this will
(2:58:35) cure you." 70% chance that it kills you what would you take the pill no no so
(2:58:42) why would you believe the study if I said this is true but there's a 70% chance it's wrong would you bank on the
(2:58:48) truth of that no no no no that's it no and didn't you bring this up during the
(2:58:54) debate debate the replication crisis with a lot of these studies it's they do the one and then there's a bunch of bias
(2:59:01) too like they're seeking so here's Yeah yeah so here's how this works the problem with the falsification of
(2:59:07) science and this is not the way science is supposed to be done by the way the problem with the falsification is
(2:59:14) this if you have like a newer study especially a sociological study there's
(2:59:20) nothing that's going to come for a while that refutes it or looks at the methodology that's going to take a while usually a year sometimes two sometimes
(2:59:26) three but because this study hits the market people reference it they then ask
(2:59:32) this question where's the reputation to the study this is what current science
(2:59:37) tells us but that's not true it's not scientific it's not really scientific at all and the truth is is they present
(2:59:44) that as being evidence knowing that a reputation is likely right around the corner that's how indoctrination works
(2:59:49) that's why so many people know so much that isn't true i started the debate by pointing out there's a reputation for
(2:59:56) this she made this Tik Tok video not very long ago i point out the reputation to the study she didn't even bother to
(3:00:03) look up the reputation to it that falsified it said that it fell under the replication crisis essentially and what
(3:00:08) do we get we get like "No no no that's just not true." Well have you looked at it well no how do you know it's not true
(3:00:15) well I don't know you know what I mean she never even bothered to look at her own sources it's affirming the bias they
(3:00:20) always affirm the bias so always be careful when somebody says "Well here's what the data says." And then it's like
(3:00:26) a study from two 2023 2024 that's the most that's the most
(3:00:31) recent but that doesn't mean it's [ __ ] correct uh we have a big uh Z
() 
(3:00:38) here with a champagne puppet after the donated $1,000 thank you man that's

(3:01:38) 302 [ __ ] ridiculous dude look you know what you know what's happened and
(3:01:44) this is backed up by science backed up by science you're supposed to store champagne bottles on the side otherwise
(3:01:51) if you store it vertical like this the cork starts to dry out becomes very difficult to open it and so you got to
(3:01:59) wait for me what the You got to wait for me Andrew i was testing it to make sure you didn't spoil it that's backed by science the latest
(3:02:08) studies say so uh that's what's been h that's why it
(3:02:14) was so difficult to open them i've now been storing storing them horizontally
(3:02:19) so uh cheers to you Andrew cheers to Z thank you Z there's only one way to do

(3:02:52) got a lot of chats coming through so I'm gonna get them hoop guys if you want $69
(3:02:58) ttsstreamabs.com/ whatever hooplin thank you man hoopliner donated $69 appreciate
(3:03:04) it andrew if you could recommend two books one non-fiction preferably about logic critical thinking passing out
(3:03:12) ideas and one fiction what would they be i would recommend Faith of the Fallen as
(3:03:18) the fictional book by Terry Goodkind that's a great one it's just a It's just a great story and then the It's a little
(3:03:25) libertarian for my liking but I would still get it and then the first one I would recommend I believe it's by Will
(3:03:31) Durant and it's called The History of Philosophy it's a fantastic book um I've
(3:03:37) read it a couple of times and I really like it not just because they he goes into the arguments a bit but he goes
(3:03:42) into why uh the various philosophers started coming to this through their life experiences which I thought was pretty
(3:03:48) interesting we have USMC coming in thank you appreciate
(3:03:54) it thank you thank you use donated $69 she was a cheating bos when she is
(3:04:01) discovered then she melts easy to see watch the video la you know what's
(3:04:07) interesting Andrew is uh two decades ago when I was in high school I was on the wrestling team and
(3:04:16) there's a there's a strategy that you can employ in wrestling uh it's called stalling this is also something that you
(3:04:22) see in other martial arts MMA jiu-jitsu i think a lot of what she was
(3:04:28) doing was stalling she she knew probably pretty quickly that she was outmatched
(3:04:34) and some of her uh some of her tone policing stuff the
(3:04:40) you know breaks brakes stalling stalling because she didn't want to actually
(3:04:45) engage with your arguments and I think that's what a good portion of it was i
(3:04:51) don't I don't disagree i also think though like I don't want you to undermine or
(3:04:57) underell because I've dealt with so many feminists this idea of control you have to understand like think of it from
(3:05:03) their perspective they're on Tik Tok and and uh Instagram places like this where they'll have controlled conversations
(3:05:10) where all opposition is muted spoken over dominated right here that's not
(3:05:16) possible imagine the panic you would feel yeah you know wait this person I can't
(3:05:22) just mute him i'm gonna have to actually engage this is going to make me look [ __ ] terrible yep you know what I
(3:05:29) mean that would instill a massive sense of panic in somebody and how many times Crucible Crew have you seen this these
(3:05:36) people panic because they actually have to defend the world it's [ __ ] crazy well I've seen your your Tik Tok
(3:05:42) invasions and and I've participated just you know I'll be I I'll have a one or
(3:05:48) two hours i'll hop on TikTok and I'll just hop into these always on theudience you'll get like 10 words in and they're
(3:05:55) like and then they you they mute you and if you they they mute you and then they
(3:06:01) just talk talk talk talk talk and then they eventually kick you the criticism sometimes you know that here at the
(3:06:06) Whatever podcast we get some criticisms like well you know you guys uh have kicked people out or you have we have an
(3:06:13) option where you can mute somebody which has happened like a dozen times maybe total for people who are super
(3:06:19) problematic oh it's often used not because somebody is winning an argument but because they're like literally
(3:06:26) yelling into the microphone or they're just hogging the Well but isn't that kind of like the most diplomatic
(3:06:31) approach when you think about it the most diplomatic approach is not to try to shut them down or this or that but say "Hey you know the show has to make
(3:06:38) some money and haha you know somebody muted your mic." That feels very diplomatic to me you know and
(3:06:45) non-abbrasive and and not to mention also because it's a panel show you know
(3:06:50) if one mic is muted it other people can speak too which is kind of the point so
(3:06:56) uh but I mean you've encountered that yourself you've debated with uh Dean and
(3:07:01) DP it's been hundreds and hundreds of times the crucible crew has run into the problem now we have a way in which we
(3:07:09) deal with it and um usually with those particular people we never have that problem again interestingly enough
(3:07:16) because there is a way in which to deal with it but the truth is is that I I'm not going to underell it because I think
(3:07:22) for sure there is a sense of panic which wells up when the control aspect is gone
(3:07:30) and you actually have to do the defense aspect yep got feminist lover here
(3:07:36) feminist lava donated $69 150 IQ or BMI anyways got put onto
(3:07:44) the pod after the recent Jire episodes and got to say you guys are both awesome
(3:07:49) keep it up and thanks for the entertainment and wisdom of course thank you feminist lover uh interesting name
(3:07:57) there got Spyro thank you Spyro appreciate it spyro the master programmer donated
(3:08:04) $69 not only did we witness why a lot of feminists can't actually defend their
(3:08:09) positions you also just saw why software/ websites/v video games tech in
(3:08:16) general has degraded this thinking is a mind vice by the way for because you
(3:08:21) don't know this I know Spyro pretty well i would actually consider him a buddy
(3:08:27) um and Spyro has been working behind the scenes kind of tirelessly to expose
(3:08:33) what's been what's been going on in software video games with uh the woke mind virus and why that stuff seems like
(3:08:39) it's so [ __ ] now highly recommend his channel uh I think it's called now you
(3:08:45) can hop in my Discord if I'm wrong about this i think it's called Spyro Floropolis maybe um but it's it's a
(3:08:52) great channel and uh he hasn't updated it as much as he should cuz you're [ __ ] lazy Spyro but you really should
(3:08:58) get back on that well I mean don't they just get into like the HR departments but I mean I've seen it no no no it's
(3:09:04) things like this like you can't say you know how like you have hard drives on your computer you can't say slave master
(3:09:10) drive now oh yeah like [ __ ] i'm not kidding yeah that's what I'm saying exactly what you're in uh the the chat
(3:09:17) doesn't like all my uh World of Warcraft references but you know what's crazy so
(3:09:23) um in I think we actually reacted to this on the dating talk i don't know if you were there so it used to be World of
(3:09:29) Warcraft i came out 2004 2005 two decades ago long time ago the character creation screen you know when you create
(3:09:35) a character in a game or whatever it used to have the gender symbols the male or the sex symbols male female they've
(3:09:42) now there's a bunch of other examples in this game blizzard is completely captured ideologically captured they've
(3:09:50) redone a lot of their art assets uh in in Hearthstone in uh to make it more
(3:09:56) homogeneous they've changed the name of Well so for the the uh gender symbols
(3:10:02) the the sex symbols they changed it instead from those to like just body type so there's body type one body type
(3:10:10) two there's no longer male female man woman uh they've renamed items like for
(3:10:15) example there used to be uh Finkele Skinner stupid what it's a and
(3:10:23) they changed the name because it was a reference to the Ace Ventura movie which he was making a joke about transgenders
(3:10:30) back in the '9s by the way so well I would say this spyro goes like these are
(3:10:36) good references but he goes in depth into the programming side of it like the the what's going on in the company yeah
(3:10:42) what's going on inside of the programming side of it and how detrimental it is and why you see such
(3:10:48) [ __ ] coming out for programs because it takes them like he explained it to me one night he's a he's a [ __ ] smart
(3:10:54) guy right like and so it's hard for me to keep up with him but he's like look if I broke this down to you how these
(3:11:00) programmers have changed the language we can't communicate anymore it used to be a universal language right and now you
(3:11:07) have to learn all sorts of new code and this and that for the purpose of what nobody's even going to see it you know
(3:11:13) what I mean crazy you know you know what I was just thinking is maybe we could we
(3:11:20) should have tagged in Oliver but he he's gone yeah Yeah yeah oliver's gone all right uh more chats
(3:11:28) coming through being a [ __ ] gremlin you're being a gremlin bro no I was just saying no we it was we got most of the
(3:11:35) debate out of the way so that was good murphy donated $69 thank you Christopher appreciate it i'll give my left nut to
(3:11:40) see Andrew and crowd attack team a full panel you're doing God's work Brian i just want to let you
(3:11:47) know you know you never know what the future's going to hold yeah I I was uh
(3:11:52) Yeah we we'd like to we'd love to have uh Crowder on the show i think that'd be epic all right we have You might You
(3:11:58) might be able to maybe do a call in one day you know we'll do it tone Police Patriarchy donated $69 thank you
(3:12:04) appreciate it very entertaining thank you both again brian is that lovely blonde lady that usually sits behind you
(3:12:11) around you guys pay tax ever going to be on the schedule well here's the thing we've actually had Homath on the show it
(3:12:18) was back in like 2023 I think he did a call-in he doesn't show uh his face on
(3:12:25) camera uh I'd love to have him back it's just call-ins are difficult to begin with but then that added complexity of
(3:12:31) and look I'm not he wants to keep his uh which is fine his privacy totally fine
(3:12:38) but uh it it does sort of complicate it but he's I love his content his
(3:12:43) content's great i've talked with several times on the phone very very very sharp guy right uh enjoy his company a lot but
(3:12:51) we're going to respect the ideas that he has around an you know his anonymous status i think that's fair uh thank you
(3:12:57) for that though you do have to pay the sim tax though for mentioning the I think you're mentioning Felicity so uh
(3:13:05) Soncho thank you Soncho sancho donated $69 she originally said she had a 2hour
(3:13:13) drive back when Brian pushed back on her travel to her people are an hour away
(3:13:19) she was flailing for a face saving way to GTFO gee he's right well the other
(3:13:25) thing is is that the uh so what we do is we offer to cover in the same way that
(3:13:31) we cover your flight in hotel we'll offer we cover their flight in the hotel of course uh and so but if my recol I'd
(3:13:39) have to look at the message give me a suite though Brian you didn't get me a [ __ ] suite Brian it's a nice hotel it
(3:13:45) is a nice hotel it's a nice hotel but Brian you didn't get me a Oh look at this
(3:13:50) div but uh let me see where it is uh yeah spring for the talent what the No
(3:13:56) it is a nice hotel you know what Andrew i Plus Jake is down here with me and we have a big announcement coming soon but
(3:14:03) I'm not going to say any more about it no we got Wait what's confusing to me
(3:14:08) though is there So when it came to the compensation for the flight and hotel she mentioned
(3:14:14) driving we the the offer was to fly her from Chicago to Santa Barbara why would
(3:14:21) she be staying an like she would have had to fly so the excuse was I have family who's ex away and I wanted to go
(3:14:28) visit them but what's the distinction in visiting them 1 hour or two hours away i have no idea
(3:14:34) the show but it's when she revealed I know how long these go but for some
(3:14:40) reason made the assumption that it's not going to go that long for me right that was she brought a laundry
(3:14:47) list of things to talk about that she wanted to discuss does she think that these this takes three four minutes to
(3:14:52) debate these issues out we barely even gotten to that debate i've been in this studio debating with one person for like
(3:14:58) nine [ __ ] hours before y I don't want to hear [ __ ] about this like couple hours we barely got to barely for debate
(3:15:07) content the long form debate content requires on each of these topics often
(3:15:12) times like a long back and forth as we deconstruct the various worldviews
(3:15:18) reconstruct them get the positions understand where the person's coming from it's not it's not so easy it's just
(3:15:24) like oh there's 90 minutes and it's settled and so Brian runs these long form and we sometimes have four or five
(3:15:30) hours debates and you know what's really funny is like I'm an old man why how come these [ __ ] 25 year olds can't
(3:15:36) keep up with me that's what's [ __ ] [ __ ] that's why the wage gap exists that's why the wage gap exists that's
(3:15:41) why the wage gap exists i make this argument all day this is why I get [ __ ] hired everywhere if I walk in with my resume they want a [ __ ]
(3:15:48) robotics mechanic anywhere in the United States when I walk in they're like "Oh it's 12 hour shift." And I'm like "It's
(3:15:53) not 14 it's not 14." Yeah uh hey you says "Thank you." Hey you
(3:16:01) appreciate Hey you donated $69 the stats are extremely important
(3:16:07) i'd prefer if they were on screen remember many of us are learning from the facts being shared and it helps us
(3:16:14) support our arguments against feminism etc okay but but here's the thing right
(3:16:21) what happens is the reason people are so resistant to send in their studies especially to the opponent is because
(3:16:28) they try to use [ __ ] studies like Yu-Gi-Oh cards right they're like "Oh it's blue eyes white dragon study." Well
(3:16:34) I have [ __ ] you know brown eyes brown dragon study and that negates blue eyes blue dragon study and that's not how
(3:16:40) it's supposed to work how it's supposed to work is that you send over it's like a discovery almost like a like court
(3:16:47) that you say "Here's what my arguments are going to be in my studies." Right you can vet those and vet the argument i
(3:16:54) can vet yours and vet the argument and then you can really go at it if people did that we could put those studies up
(3:16:59) on screen and I could say like "Go to page you know two 221 here's where you can vet that information and Brian could
(3:17:06) pull it right up on screen right?" But just remember not everybody's willing to do that and so the thing is like me as a
(3:17:13) debater I have to be prepared for [ __ ] everything which is insane and
(3:17:18) always perform at a high level which is insane but I do I would vastly prefer to
(3:17:24) be like here's my top three studies and here's my arguments here's what forest doctrine means this and that and just go
(3:17:29) at it that way but it's it's difficult to do guys it's not as easy as you think
(3:17:34) we have Justin Martins say thank you Justin appreciate it justin Martins donated
(3:17:40) $69 you should use her fee to order Big Meanie Head Andrew a pineapple pizza so
(3:17:46) we can watch him cry too that That would make me cry that would have been That would have
(3:17:51) been uh kind of the Yeah pineapple pizza where is it all right thank you Justin
(3:17:57) Martins we got Jim Walsh here we tried We actually already tried to get you pineapple pizza it was not effective jim
(3:18:03) Walsh $1,162 donated $69 thank you Jim i bet a
(3:18:09) year's salary she was on Coke she had Destiny Jaw and couldn't stop wiping her
(3:18:14) nose i mean I did notice she would I I don't think she was on anything wait wait you noticed what well she at least
(3:18:22) a dozen times she'd kind of not I didn't see anything but like she was constantly
(3:18:29) like touching her nose like this i don't know if that means any that probably doesn't mean anything well the problem
(3:18:35) is is that I'm a very beautiful man and so I was busy looking at the monitor like this yes actually the reason the
(3:18:42) reason I often look at the monitor during debates if you guys are wondering it's cuz I'm old and I've been shooting guns for years and years and years and
(3:18:49) my left ear is my more dominant ear and so I actually am the reason I'm looking
(3:18:55) this way and you'll see me look this way often is because I can hear people way better
(3:19:00) h got Cha hey thank you Cha appreciate it chaw XD donated
(3:19:06) $69 i'm a software engineer at a game company my company is Philly with women
(3:19:11) who have never played games and hate players i also was made to work for 3 months renaming repositories for DI
(3:19:19) reasons good god just data repositories really is that
(3:19:25) what he means data repositories doesn't is Spyro's stuff related I mean
(3:19:30) this go that wasn't Spyro then no I know it wasn't Spyro but it's kind of related to the stuff that's going on with gaming
(3:19:35) companies for example uh is his stuff relate I mean this goes way back to like Gamergate well Spyro Spyro is a
(3:19:43) brilliant he's a contractor software engineer and he's brilliant so I'm not going to get into everybody
(3:19:49) he's contracted with that's not my business to tell right but he's he's been in with some of the larger
(3:19:56) contractors out there between every sector you can imagine which would include like military others
(3:20:03) you know what I mean right and he he knows his [ __ ] like defense contractors and stuff i'm not saying that yeah okay
(3:20:09) did I say that no no no no no got Croj hey thank you Cro
(3:20:15) 012094 donated $69 asian game developers don't care what
(3:20:21) feminists think marvel Rivals releases female heroes with giant swoops and
(3:20:27) butts with zero care for what screeching feminists cry about what do you think of
(3:20:32) it well I think that it's like the like mustache man on Twitter that most people
(3:20:37) don't give a [ __ ] about mustache man they just think it's really funny to watch people freak out right about
(3:20:43) mustache man i think they just think it's really funny and so they do that right and I think in some ways Asian
(3:20:50) countries actually are trolling the United States right like you'll you'll notice that some of the old Dead or Alive games in Japan or China don't
(3:20:57) actually have like the breast enhancement thing but in the United States there's actually codes for the breast enhance i think some of it's like
(3:21:04) I think they're trolling us am I crazy i think they're trolling us dude could be
(3:21:09) it could be i know in like World of Warcraft they uh there there was a a
(3:21:16) warlock pet that was a succubus succubi succubus succubus succubus or it's like
(3:21:24) a female female demon or whatever yeah that's the succubus the incubus is the male and it it was always a female but
(3:21:30) then like cuz they're like "Oh well this is uh this is sexualizing and
(3:21:35) objectifying pixelated." Yeah demon in a video game they introduced
(3:21:42) the male to the Incubus I believe like you said it's called just just stupid stuff i don't know they're changing the
(3:21:48) original game it's weird uh let's see we have Lucas here lucas thank you man appreciate it lucas donated $70 you have
(3:21:54) a second one coming i'm sure it's probably just me being an old crotchety flowers but I have no patience and
(3:22:01) tolerance for an incompetent sniveling weak weasel this chick was the epitome of Chihuahua syndrome tough
(3:22:10) uh is I don't know i don't see the second one coming in yet Lucas so I'm going to let yikes come through but I'll
(3:22:15) hers up next thank you Lucas $69 this is how you know feminism is
(3:22:22) weak imagine MLK fighting for civil rights and the moment someone challenges
(3:22:27) his worldview he threatens to walk out or has a man or started to try actually
(3:22:33) this is a really good point right and this is a a good case of the idea of how
(3:22:39) women treat men versus how men treat women the demand is that I treat this woman like an equal so I did but you can
(3:22:46) imagine if it was me in that same stance right i came in the very first night i
(3:22:51) hadn't slept in 24 hours i was sweating i was all [ __ ] up because I hadn't slept and I could barely even process
(3:22:59) what was coming at me right but I'm like got to do that [ __ ] you got to get through it right that's part that's part
(3:23:06) that's part of how it goes that's part of work a different totally different mindset about how these things are done
(3:23:13) and it's like um but from from her view at the same time she must be privileged
(3:23:20) and treated as an equal and it's like well both of those things don't actually mesh right i mean it ties back into her
(3:23:28) her I think weak arguments as it relates to the wage gap uh you know there no
(3:23:36) arguments well yeah men are just more willing to they're more willing to uh
(3:23:43) work through when they're sick they're more willing to work overtime and well speaking speaking of what she said with
(3:23:50) the wage gaps I want you guys to remember this framing she starts the framing by saying this there could be
(3:23:56) three different reasons for this and I wrote it down and the first thing I wrote was like "No there could be 50
(3:24:01) reasons for this there could be 100 reasons for this right but it the framing was there can only be three so
(3:24:10) what she wanted me to do was select from one of the three like [ __ ] it i'm not selecting from one of your three
(3:24:15) [ __ ] reasons for the wage gap because that's all how you frame it [ __ ] that here's what's actually going on
(3:24:22) that's the right way to argue what she did was try to frame it as a false dichotomy in this case there was a multitude of dichotoies it was one two
(3:24:29) three instead of just one and two but it's so it's like you know what are you doing here yeah yeah and to your point
(3:24:37) uh you know Andrew you've been doing a bunch of traveling like you said you came in that one day you hadn't slept
(3:24:42) for uh 24 hours you still did the show i was sick last week still did the show i
(3:24:48) was I had a terrible sinus infection i had a fever i When Jim Bob it was uh Jim
(3:24:54) Bob I think it was when Yeah jim Bob and Oliver were debating my fever was getting so bad I had to excuse myself
(3:25:01) and go lay down and I was on the verge of throwing and I but I still came and
(3:25:08) did it still came and worked still came and did it still came and worked and that's the thing is like I got off the plane and was like "Oh my god I don't
(3:25:13) know how I'm going to do this i literally can't even think." You know you guys know what what I mean where
(3:25:18) like you're so tired you can't really process information well anyway and you're just on autopilot when that
(3:25:25) debate was over I was like I still won the debate but holy [ __ ] man that was hours of
(3:25:30) debating too and just pure autopilot that was just pure autopilot
(3:25:38) all right we have Lucas here with his follow-up chat then we're going to get this here wrapped up lucas donated $70
(3:25:44) last call if you guys want to get one/ barking until you called her out on her [ __ ] bravo Spyro Synonym Andrew
(3:25:53) in my opinion Will Durant is arguably one of the best somewhat recent historian you think so i I
(3:26:01) um I enjoyed the guy has a bit of flourish for storytelling too it's not
(3:26:06) just a matter of um you know how you can read some historical accounts and
(3:26:11) they're really [ __ ] boring the guy has a bit of a flourish i really enjoyed it and by the way it's my wife who picks
(3:26:17) up a lot of those books for me hey I just what she'll do is she'll be out and she'll be like I just saw this and I
(3:26:22) thought you might like it and I'm like I don't [ __ ] And I find myself at night I grab the [ __ ] and I'm like yeah she
(3:26:27) was right this is actually pretty [ __ ] good yeah by the way we still this is one of
(3:26:33) our I mean I think there's been a few episodes where we've had more than this we still have tw uh just under 12,000
(3:26:40) concurrent viewers just on my stream uh we peaked at about I think
(3:26:45) 14,000 i think it would have been great to keep going unfortunately she just dipped dipped did the I don't know if it
(3:26:51) was a rage quit what would you call that a cry that was a rage quit was it a rage quit oh yeah okay it's a rage quit and
(3:26:57) in fact there are other rage quits which were way less legitimate than that that was a [ __ ] rage quit yes yes oh while
(3:27:05) we have uh the viewers here I do want to ask um guys debate I'm asking for Oh
(3:27:11) well that there's that but I need to ask for some assistance from any viewers who may be able to help uh for almost six
(3:27:20) seven weeks now my Twitter has been uh I don't know how to exactly explain it
(3:27:26) basically every single uh v video or photo I post so if I post any media it
(3:27:33) gets put behind a sensitive content warning my entire Twitter profile
(3:27:38) ex-profile is behind a what they call an interstitial a content warning i think
(3:27:45) there might have been one or two posts not even my own videos i was just uh doing like reaction commentary on
(3:27:51) something uh got flagged i've reached out to to X they don't have support if
(3:27:57) anybody's watching who has a contact at Twitter X uh maybe you you've worked
(3:28:03) there if anybody can just maybe send me a DM either on Twitter that's whatever or you can DM me on Instagram at

(3:29:37) we have Michael G here he writes "Her right-wing dad owes Andrew a case of
(3:29:42) single malt oliver was a champ compared to her men are better feminists than
(3:29:48) women." Isn't that interesting but here's the thing in my opponent's credit she did say that her objective is to win
(3:29:54) as many men to her own side because she obviously knows that that is the case that mo more of the smart feminists
(3:30:00) actually are beginning to realize that they need male feminists to come in and make the arguments and dominance because
(3:30:06) of force doctrine they literally need that isn't it hilarious and ironic at the same time yep and then we have the
(3:30:14) state of things let's take it one step further women are so privileged that once they're taken down to the privilege
(3:30:20) of men they're disrespected and shouldn't even dignify entertaining the men they're equal to right which is the
(3:30:27) the like pre assumption there is that men are dirt and garbage right men
(3:30:32) they're dirt and garbage and they shouldn't even be dignified with an answer the second they become equal to men isn't that [ __ ] hilarious
(3:30:39) let's see if we have looks like we have something from Kevin here he says Kevin 89 donated $69 thank you Kevin for
(3:30:48) the first time men were the deciding factor in the presidential election do you think women like this are aware of
(3:30:54) how off-putting they are to the average male voter if not then cool lol no no
(3:31:00) actually listen they don't they're going to double and triple down quadruple down this ideology i will say this about
(3:31:06) Oliver oliver when I was uh after the show was done I went um on the balcony to have a smoke he came out with me and
(3:31:12) Jake and he literally said "It's because leftists are so [ __ ] cringe and he's
(3:31:17) a leftist that's why we keep losing." like they don't really realize to the
(3:31:23) average person who's watching it like imagine like there's ladies out there watching this right now their husbands
(3:31:28) are working their [ __ ] asses off they get home and they're like this is how they want they expect me to treat this
(3:31:35) guy or husbands who are like why would I want my [ __ ] wife to ever be like that when you can't say the word Indian
(3:31:42) like what the [ __ ] that's how people normal people think through that prism and it's like it's so wild to me that
(3:31:49) they double and triple down on that yep uh let's see here okay guys final thing
(3:31:56) if you want to support the show without platforms taking their cut Venmo Cash App whatever yeah well let me ask you something sure okay so you get home it's
(3:32:03) like [ __ ] 10-hour shift at the factory right and what you've been doing at the factory all day is some heavy ass
(3:32:09) labor let's just say that you're a hyo driver right and then and then you do stocking on top of that mh so you get
(3:32:15) out of the hyo you have to get off of it on off on you're driving this thing all around they extended your shift another

(3:32:27) you sit down you take that first bite you haven't eaten all [ __ ] day okay you take that first bite and you're like
(3:32:34) "Oh my god anything would have been delicious but this is extra delicious because she tried to make it exactly
(3:32:39) tailored how you want." You take that first bite right and you say "Man this guy at work today we were talking about
(3:32:45) Indians." And she's like "Native Americans." The wife says "Native Americans." Like
(3:32:51) doesn't now the food tastes bad now the food is awful and horrible like everything around you now
