Title: Best Of Andrew Wilson On The Whatever Podcast 2024

(0:00) um you do only fans as well do your parents know supportive not supportive so my mom knows she I actually just told

(0:07) her about the only fans she's been known that I'm a dancer since I started my stepdad knows I'm a dancer but he

(0:12) doesn't really he doesn't know about the only fans just because he has a pretty Antiquated view on you know the internet's there forever and safety and

(0:19) stuff like that so he doesn't really when you say Antiquated view what do you mean I think it's just um a boomer SL

(0:26) Gen X perspective that what what perspective is that that you what is the Antiquated

(0:33) perspective yeah that you shouldn't post that stuff on the internet conservative yeah yeah I guess would be and is that

(0:41) Antiquated or is that I mean I would it's definely more common amongst

(0:47) older populations of wait so do your parents do they know that you're they said they know that you dance yeah so

(0:54) they both know that I dance my mom knows that I do only dance my biological dad does not know either that as far as IW

(1:02) and is your mom is she supportive yes she's all about me my money about she's she's all about you making your money uh

(1:08) what about your dad biological dad or stepdad both um well my stepdad also

(1:14) doesn't really care as long as I'm safe that's like the main thing for him and same thing for my mom but you know he's

(1:19) also wants me to be self-sufficient and stuff like that so that's like really their main concern is my self

(1:24) self-sufficiency couldn't you be self-sufficient though without um it's a lot more difficult so I did like you

(1:30) know as a young person the only options that I have you know for a job is

(1:35) entry-level stuff and then also like fast food work and stuff like that I could work my way you know as a manager

(1:41) in a fast food restaurant but that's really the highest up position that I could get and then Nala uh I mean I

(1:46) think you maybe talked a bit so my dad both all my my entire family knows um my mom and I don't speak anymore she's very

(1:54) uh religious conservative we've never had a good relationship throughout my entire life it didn't even matter when I

(1:59) was a p um my dad found out and everything very

(2:04) just supportive of me he is still a Christian he loves me me and my dad have

(2:09) had a really good relationship throughout the years I financially support my family because they're retired now and have like kids who have

(2:16) kids and like my nieces and nephew need like things sometimes so I love to give money to my family because you know I

(2:23) have it and they're still part of my family like I care about them so even if I didn't speak to them I

(2:29) wouldn't care like I made the decisions I made and I'm being very smart about it and obviously I know that only fans is

(2:36) not the end result I went to college to be a dental hygienist and I worked in an orthopedic office scheduling surgeries

(2:43) and stuff I had big girl jobs with big girl benefits that didn't pay the bills so I'm like listen I have huge Pursuits

(2:49) like snowboarding snowboarding's expensive I want to be tutored in Japanese that's expensive like I wanted

(2:57) things that I couldn't achieve with a normal job and like something that men

(3:02) think that I should be doing you know so me pursuing this only fans career gave me so much freedom to expand as a human

(3:11) being and I was like wow like this is what I want to do and again this won't

(3:16) last forever just just get a curiosity um you couldn't have gone snowboarding and learned Japanese without doing only

(3:23) fans I what I was telling you is that it cost money that I didn't have doing

(3:28) things like being a surgery schedule or working like I like I said I went to college like I got my little degree and

(3:34) everything and that got me nowhere especially with this economy right now it's so bad I could not live in

(3:39) California doing what I did absolutely not it's so bad and then I was like I have to get a second job as a female who

(3:46) doesn't have a boyfriend to you know I wasn't being supported by anyone so I was like okay you know what I think I'm

(3:52) really good at a present having a presence online and I pursued so much I

(3:57) don't just do only fans and and only fans is really kind like my content for only fans is slowed down so that I could

(4:04) pursue bigger things that led me down different Financial routes so again this

(4:10) was a starter not an Ender can I ask one question about to all the girls that do only fans because Lord knows y'all make

(4:17) a lot of money and I'm I'm going to be honest sometimes I make jokes at work and I'm like I work obscene amount of

(4:23) hours to not make anywhere near as much money but but there is a part of me that's also wondering like you like you

(4:30) said you can't do this forever and when you go back into let's say civilian life

(4:35) you're going to look at everything and be like I'm not going to accept any of this because you're going to make a

(4:41) eighth of what you made so it's not about that what I'm trying to do is set I almost want to answer you're going to

(4:47) make money no no no but the point of making the point of making that much money say I'm not going back to normal

(4:54) job that's the whole point so you're investing buy you're investing buying no

(5:00) hold on hold on I think I mean perhaps you don't have

(5:06) any history on Nala Nala let me ask you a question um if you wanted to retire today could you million per I could have

(5:13) retired a year ago so it's I mean I I you you're not familiar with Nala but I think asking her that spe granted there

(5:19) are women who do only fans who they will face that challenge but I think Nala here is an exceptional for well it's

(5:26) it's just so much more about growing yourself as a person and not just growing and making content and taking

(5:31) pictures of yourself that doesn't help you do anything bigger and then when you're making this much money as such a

(5:37) young person you're like wow this is the time to be an adult you need to set up

(5:42) for your future self like you need to think of like the future Nala and be like you know what she'd want to be

(5:47) comfortable too and she would want to continue sending her parents money I know that for a fact cuz I don't feel

(5:52) like I'm changing anytime soon you know so that was the biggest purpose of this and I felt so steady in my decision

(5:59) making through this and financial just like maneuvering I'm so thankful that I

(6:04) did what I did I have a quick just a quick question if your parents if you went to your parents and you asked them

(6:11) you said you know I have a choice I can either quit doing all of this tomorrow right and go get a job for like a tenth

(6:17) of this or I can continue to do this and send you money which one do you think they would ask my mom would say

(6:24) absolutely quit my dad he'd be like oh my God no why would you ever quit

(6:31) your dad would say that my dad would say that I send money to my dad so that he can be comfortable with like their

(6:37) Pastor no he's not a pastor anymore they stopped being a pastor when I was like 18 okay but he was and he retained his

(6:42) faith right he did he did I'm his daughter though you know I'm not just some stranger he's like you know what if

(6:48) I want her in my do that make it worse like wouldn't that make it worse don't you have to accept your kids for who

(6:53) they are what and so Guys One mic at a time one M time

(7:00) I'll question you had a kid and they were doing only fans what you just disown them because they're doing they

(7:05) made a bad decision until they clean their life up yeah you're bad parent wow that's my

(7:12) 100% what about you're a bad kid guys guys guys please one person

(7:20) speaking at a time go ahead you guys go ahead you can think your kid is bad and disagree with their life choices sure

(7:26) but as a parent you're supposed to be like a guiding figure and a loving figure and part of that is not abandoning them in their time of need

(7:33) and if you want if you want to talk about Christianity if you want to talk about Christianity if you want to talk about like God and Jesus and the

(7:39) countless stories there are in the Bible like still I got respond to this I got to respond to this okay listen first of

(7:44) all let's dive into this just a little bit okay my daughter calls me up and she's like hey Dad you know I'm still

(7:51) going to be doing only fans but I'm kind of thinking about not doing it right I would say yes absolutely don't do it in

(7:57) her situation she's like no he would totally be cool with it you're saying you would own your child you're saying

(8:03) you would say gone child what was the context the context is tell what he the

(8:09) context wasis we asked the the question was straightforwardly asked um if you

(8:15) found out your daughter had only fans what would you do until she cleaned up I

(8:20) would not be participating with her or allow her in my life said you probably easier that why is that awful because

(8:26) you're not supporting your child yeah I'm not supporting

(8:31) face consequen a decision doesn't make them as a whole though yeah the thing you all know better you literally told

(8:38) me you know for sure what you're doing is bad and you're just going to do it anyway and then you're like Dad support

(8:43) it's crazy who said it's bad though that's crazy Nala even what Nala said she said her dad doesn't support she

(8:49) might not support what she does only fans whatever but he's like you know what you're my daughter and if that's

(8:55) what you want to do with your life that doesn't mean I'm I I'm saying yeah go do that are you this is love you and I'm

(9:02) still going to be in your life are you sure that's not just cope cuz the same thing could happen to you well that's that's not true at all though yeah isn't

(9:08) it though isn't it really cope you're just upset because your parents might actually do this to you they might make you feel the consequences of this let

(9:15) them and then what you're just an independent without parents I don't so if you don't care if they dis you why would you say you're a bad parent of

(9:22) course I care call you AB do you think your daughter do you think your daughter would care if you abandoned her very

(9:28) simple abandoning an adult an adult yes you can

(9:34) there is no age that you cannot abandon your with your kids when they're 60 and making bad choices support them decision

(9:43) you don't have to say you don't have to say every decision they do is good you don't have to support every decision they do but that is very distinct than

(9:50) disowning your own child and I hope we can all agree you know what a limit is stop being so emotional and be

(9:57) logical for 5 seconds go ahead um for me so my mom she's

(10:02) extremely Catholic she GRE in the Philippines like the only place where divorce is illegal and her when I she first found out obviously there was a I

(10:09) have a big question for me it's like what if what if you committed adultery against your wife and then your kid

(10:14) found out about that and disowned you because should my wife abandon me should my wife abandon me when I commit

(10:19) adultery and do something she doesn't like talking about the daughter no no answer my question hang on this is a perfect my wife so is a question with

(10:27) the question yeah yeah yeah yeah I'll I'll answer so answer I'll answer then you answer so the answer is yes would

(10:32) sorry I did say that she could go so I'm sorry but go ahe um so I was saying is I feel like so me and my mom we were

(10:38) distant you know out of point when she found out but then I feel like as a mother like she just kind of stands one

(10:44) from her for a Catholic perspective it's not mine it's that um everyone has their own sins she has no place to judge me cuz she has her own things and then the

(10:50) other thing is she noticed like when we're talking about um bad life choices and your kid coming back when their life's cleaned up my mom realized I was

(10:57) always just on a better path when I had her life in my life like when if when I was distant from her then I was going

(11:03) further into things that she didn't want to see me in because just having your parents love is just kind of motivating

(11:09) having your parents acceptance any goal you have of your kid just doing better for themselves will be easier when they

(11:14) know that their parent loves them even if you know I don't I don't support this I don't want to hear about this but I still love you maybe you barely talk to

(11:20) them every day but okay for me I'm diabetic do you think my my parents would never yeah they would never stop

(11:25) giving me insulin I could have done anything in the world they would always make sure I have my insulin yeah like certain things you see I'm saying I'm not I know that's a different extreme

(11:32) but it's kind of like like V donated 200s if my daughter

(11:39) did of that means I failed her as a father she would do of only if I am dead or in jail your fathers are morally weak

(11:46) men they are morally weak men I guess could I ask you who do you think is the example well I mean you can say you but

(11:52) he's right look the chatter is right can I ask you a question hang on finish my point going to tell

(12:00) right you do have to be a morally weak man if they know like in your case maybe not because your dad doesn't know okay

(12:06) but a lot of people that I've talked to here their dads do know and they're just like but we're adult adult able to make

(12:13) our own decision my dad doesn't like it finished but point I'm almost done okay yeah I think that that's a moral

(12:19) weakness to say I will enable you I will enable you to do this threshold breaking

(12:24) thing especially from a Christian perspect it's insane I don't I don't know why anybody would do it I would say listen because real Christians love

(12:30) everyone so then all so then why not just make everything permiss I love the fact that you're like I'll disown my daughter that's not so everything's

(12:37) permissible I didn't think that there's a difference between deling someone permissible no no okay but all social

(12:44) behaviors all sexual behaviors all everything Christians must permit that who's the example in Christianity for answer the question Christians must I

(12:51) feel like ask him that who in answer I'm asking you the question is

(12:57) it per is all forms of social ual Behavior something which are supposed to be permissible to Christians I don't

(13:02) think it should be permissible I think that you should love no matter what so then if it's not permiss if it's not

(13:07) permissible then I'm not giving permission which means I'm not endorsing it which means I'm not allowing it which means I'm totally against it if your kid

(13:14) is an adult why do you have to allow them to do something what do you I'm not allowing

(13:20) them the question I have what are you talking about who in Christianity is the example for parenting who is it you mean

(13:27) in which context which Saints are you talking about what talking about there's Saints which you can look to as examples

(13:33) in parenting who do you look to as the example for parenting as the example inside of Christianity of one sec

(13:41) honestly Nala has a special brand of daddy isues every girl has a craving for

(13:46) M attention if she doesn't get it from her dad she will get by being a thought

(13:51) thought so here I need to yeah look at Jesus Christ you want to answer but like I I do want to I have so many notes I

(13:57) have to get through so go ahead all it sounded like you wanted to say something so so I feel like a lot of

(14:03) people think that because what I do I have daddy issues or mommy issues or whatever the it is but it's honestly

(14:09) it's a self-made choice I didn't go to my dad and be like you know should I do this and he just gave me like all this

(14:15) advice to do it you know I came to them told them because I wanted to be honest with my parents they have that reason

(14:22) like they have that decision to make with their kid if they do something like this you know what I mean like whether

(14:28) they want to be in your life or not I think it's bad parenting if you don't want to be in your kids's life no matter what they do I'm not saying if they like

(14:34) delete someone that's like that's a great I don't know I feel like the line is just too broad here so let me ask you

(14:40) this can you make the judgment and the value added judgment on what's bad parenting I have children do you have

(14:47) any no okay and then on top of it from your parents perspective you turned out

(14:53) to go off and do only fans and like show your butthole online for money how's that great parenting how could you come

(15:00) to me and say what a great parent should do is this you're the perfect example of everything that nobody should listen to

(15:06) for greatting is Christ a terrible parent because like so many of his sons and daughters commit sin you said Jesus

(15:13) is your example for parenting who did Jesus D this is a hilarious of course he

(15:18) died for everybody oh dying I'm sorry go ahead who did he dine with you in in which

(15:25) context like his Apostles or in the gospels who did he he would dine with body D with Sinners he would D with sa

(15:31) he called Godless fools and rejected outr okay just stop just get to your point know this well it's fine if you

(15:38) don't know the people he called Godless fools was Pharisees the leaders of the

(15:43) religion whereas in the cases of women who were adulterers Tax Collectors he

(15:48) told no more he told them to sin no more but still dined with them and he told them to sin no more you should go and

(15:55) dising is not the same thing as saying sin dising and tell a behavior is modified that's behavior modification no

(16:02) it's not do you there's a million ways to not hold on hold on hold on there's a million ways to condone an action how do

(16:09) you even reconcile the prodical son when the father as the son walks home says

(16:14) you've been my son the whole time he never removed it the son left and the

(16:19) father allowed him to live out the consequences of that but the father didn't the father didn't send him away

(16:25) and when he came back he threw him a massive party terrible prodical son but here's the

(16:31) thing when you're looking at what happened in the results of the prodical son the father did not go where the son

(16:39) was where the son was committing all these heinous acts stop stop not saying you should started only

(16:45) fans not say only all sping you're all sping you're

(16:51) all sping calm down let me finish my point okay Dad didn't dad didn't go

(16:56) where he was Dad wasn't going and uh you know trying to pull him back he wasn't doing any of this he was saying I don't

(17:02) I don't endorse what it is that you're doing what you're going after yes he did say that he told him it was a bad idea

(17:08) to leave that's a very big difference between he told him it was a bad now he left anyway after breaking the fortune

(17:14) and then when he came back humble when he came back humble with his tail between his legs crying his eyes out did

(17:21) his father say you you've now returned to me the prodigal son and now All Is

(17:26) Forgiven you have always always is the key word here you've always been they're

(17:31) still always your kid not if you them that doesn't mean not if you disown them

(17:37) doesn't mean you have to it in the cases like did he not go with them to like go and [ __ ] it up with [ __ ] and blow

(17:42) money on crack no he didn't but she's not saying Hey Dad come do only fans with me you should start my dad is

(17:48) nowhere in my life yeah but my point my point is is this is that again when he came back humble when he came back

(17:54) correct when he came back from doing the horrible things that he was doing then dad said yes welcome back in you were

(18:01) always my son of course I never stopped loving you but he was not endorsing all the

(18:06) things me finish he was not endorsing all the things the kid was doing he was not going out of his way to make sure

(18:12) that the kid had additional money to continue sending where he was at he wasn't doing any of that asking that I'm not saying any of these things the issue

(18:18) is that if Christ is the example for parenting and he loves you every single step of the way dising your child is the

(18:26) opposite of that thing now I am fine with parents getting to decide if you like don't want to like support that

(18:31) they tell them explicitly like I would be fine with a relationship like my parents are Christian my brother's gay

(18:37) I'm fine with them regularly being can the Catholic church excommunicate people yes but the Catholic church is in no way

(18:42) the same thing as yeah so is if the Catholic Church excommunicates somebody are you saying that what they're doing why do they excommunicate that's an ex

(18:50) [ __ ] we're getting okay make make a final point if you make if you make an

(18:57) excommunication why is it that they're not turning their back on their children okay an excommunication at an Apostolic

(19:03) level of the Catholic church is about Godless fools it's about Pro that is why the Eastern Orthodox was removed they

(19:09) broke up with you because they thought that you got I know you guys broke up with us after but that's just not true

(19:15) the reason that they were cath I'm not a Catholic but I'm theologic Catholic I'm more Catholic than I Eastern Orthodox

(19:22) seconds 20 seconds the reason that churches excommunicate is because they're violating the nature of God

(19:27) himself not not because they're doing a sin that they dislike it's extremely different and these types of sins like

(19:33) blaspheming the holy spirit is in no way comparable to moral sins or virtue sins

(19:39) which maybe only finds as moral sins or maybe it's a virtue sin I'm not sure where it falls specifically but acting

(19:45) like the church can excommunicate so parents can excommunicate their children is a bastardization of why the Catholic

(19:51) Church does this in the first place so let's look at this logically to what you're saying not what the distinction

(19:56) which the distinctions and the reasoning are yeah I know I'm just trying to respond what the distinction and the reasonings are let's look at this from a

(20:02) holistic you claimed listen because Jesus Christ said thing X it's not

(20:08) proper for you to then say nope I'll walk away from this but it is proper for the Catholic Church to do the same thing

(20:14) under the same circumstances and your only claim to this is to say that they

(20:19) rejected that they rejected Christ so the same thing happens exactly is not

(20:24) rejecting Christ it can be rejecting Christ Blas

(20:30) H what the what the Pharisees did was bad enough are dis anous and you're being

(20:37) dishonest no that's not they're not disanalogous this is your logic no this is a logic of like all of the

(20:44) the wait inter interlude uh can we but it's weird why is it weird she said it

(20:50) was weird I don't know what she said why is it weird say what you want to

(20:56) say I just feel like it's none of your business like like anyone's business to like know what anyone's body count is

(21:01) like and quite frankly like I would even want to know from another guy cuz then like if it's a number I don't want to

(21:06) hear like I'm not going to like you anymore all right well maybe we'll come back to that we'll continue going around the table I want to get everybody's answers go ahead no you don't object to

(21:16) okay I don't object uh no I think it's it's fair to

(21:23) you know that for that to put you off um but I would also say that

(21:29) [Music] maybe Sweet Tooth thank you for the gifted 20 memberships maybe I would say

(21:36) that maybe uh don't discount somebody because of that because that's not you know necessarily I mean you could really

(21:43) miss out on somebody good who has a past that you know maybe doesn't align with your virtues but also maybe they don't

(21:49) maybe they've grown from that and uh so yeah I'd probably still discount them

(21:56) but uh um I object oh okay so just to bring it back

(22:03) why is it weird it's invasive what's invasive the whole body cam

(22:10) phenomena how what do you mean to like here let me paint this let me give you a

(22:15) scenario let me give you a scenario let's say the guy doesn't even ask he just knows because you've been friends

(22:21) with you know maybe he's been in your Social Circle and he's known you for 3 years and he's known you've gone out to

(22:27) parties and bars he's heard through the gra Vine that you've slept with 20 men in the past 3 years um he doesn't ask

(22:34) you outright is it invasive then for the guy to not want to date you because

(22:39) you've slept with 20 men in the past three years no but I do think it's heavily judgmental it's heavily judgmental so

(22:46) you object to judging people didn't you say earlier that you you're your

(22:53) allowance well not allowance but you need a guy to spend $5 to $10,000 on you

(22:58) a month I said that's the average amount of probably what it would come to if you're putting like like fun things like

(23:05) the average relationship expenses into play but definitely not an allowance would you would you date a guy who works

(23:11) at McDonald's no so so you're judging him judgement is that that's a judgment

(23:16) you could have been missing out on like the best burger flipper ever and you just pass him by how judgy I just I I don't know I

(23:25) think body counts between like 10 to 30 in today's society is like normal

(23:31) honestly let me ask a different question I'm just curious about I assume right

(23:37) this second you enter into this dating Market I don't know much about the dating Market I've been off it for a long time

(23:43) and thank God for that but let's say enter into it right

(23:49) now and you were a virgin would it be invasive somebody asked your body count

(23:54) them yes I still wouldn't tell anybody because I feel like like guys take advantage of women who have low sexual

(24:01) experience how do they take advantage how how do they take advantage you think that most women's answers when they

(24:09) answer that it's invasive or they don't like it or this type of things is because they have themselves a high body

(24:14) count not necessarily I'd even consider myself to be in that category I just don't think it's any it's a man's

(24:20) business like why like what benefit do you gain knowing who I I've s with in the past like so we can disqualify you

(24:26) from yeah but I I agree with say too because

(24:31) sometimes ignorance is bliss like let's say hypothetically you meet give me the red pill that's a blue pill okay let I want

(24:40) I want to know so I can make a determination of do I want to date this person yes or no I don't want like I

(24:48) would want that information that way I can make a determination yeah but let's say in every single aspect of this one

(24:55) person let's say you've been meeting people and it's never worked out with anyone and you meet this one person they're absolutely perfect in every

(25:00) single aspect and then except this one thing but they have a body count of you find out later okay not but you said

(25:07) what you consider high as 10 let's say it's well I'm using the extreme like I'm using the extreme on both sides so the

(25:13) extreme is this is perfect woman Butler donated $200 thank you since one in

(25:19) three women aged 16 to 30 has a STD now and condoms don't protect from genital

(25:25) herpes body count matters y Fe turned your lady Parts into a radioactive

(25:31) Wasteland I'm going to go vomit Radioactive by the way here let me drop the nuke actually Nick could you click

(25:39) the nuke red click nuke red yeah radioactive Wasteland there it is folks

(25:44) look at that Holy that's that's what it's looking like all right Nick you can all yeah okay um so to use an extreme on

(25:52) both ends you're saying well the perfect woman she's perfect in every way she's a 10 out of 10 she's blah whatever

(25:59) but here's the extreme on the other end she has slept with over 100 men

(26:05) yeah that's a no but wouldn't you rather just not know like you just you want to

(26:12) keep her eyes this perfect no I want the truth TR truth Uber Alis let's just I

(26:17) want the truth over let's just kind of let's just kind of Grant it though you know what let say your preference is

(26:22) that you didn't know because for you right not knowing is a thing that you

(26:27) would prefer yeah cuz I you be any problem though honest would you say there would be any problem though for a

(26:34) person who did want to know they did want to know the truth maybe ignorance is bliss for you is true but maybe for

(26:40) another person ignorance is bliss not so true but like why do they want to know so badly and with the thing with STD is

(26:46) you can want to be so ignorant so badly literally well I I just don't really care it's not that I want that so badly

(26:53) and if like my boyfriend C is going to tell me his body count I'd like run away and close my ear but your push back is

(26:58) what ignorance is bliss like okay that's fair enough it's true maybe if you're ignorant about something um and you

(27:04) didn't have any forn knowledge to it you might go a certain way like okay maybe but if another person had the preference

(27:11) to not be ignorant on on the topic what what still would be the objection other than you just kind of think it's icky

(27:18) right that's really it when you get down to the the value judgment in other words aren't you guys really just saying I

(27:23) think it's icky I think it's yucky there's not really anything else I mean it's like someone's privacy like their

(27:30) personal life like to me is something that's very intimate and it's private intimate if you have a high body yeah

(27:37) but I think sorry I don't I think Izzy and I kind of see similar to this on on this particular topic because we're not using this as an excuse to be go

(27:43) promiscuous you know and sleep with a bunch of guys I'm just saying I think it's rude for a man to ask a lady how

(27:49) many guys have you slept with I Rec not rude I recently actually spoke to a guy about this and he I think him and I like

(27:56) kind of agreed on the standpoint like we don't need to know each other's body counts but if you are in if we both are

(28:02) in an area and you see somebody that you slept with do me the favor and let me know so and we're in the same area and

(28:08) I'll do the same that's asking you your body count just in a in a different way no but it's no it's just like if you

(28:15) slept with a dude can you just point him out that's not invasive but the but the alternative but

(28:21) the alternative ask you have any SLE like if we're if we're like at a party or something that sounds 10 times

(28:27) worse know just so they don't make a fool out of themselves and the person is there you know but like to go out and

(28:33) ask for a number like that that's just wild and I never give it to you just point out the person right it's like

(28:39) what this is actually a great reason why men ought to date women with low body counts so the likelihood of you being in

(28:46) a scenario where you're in the same room as another man who's [ __ ] your

(28:52) woman you're just almost making our argument for us yeah in fact that's your demand you're like hey I had a

(28:57) conversation like look if you been in a room with dud youve been can you out that's literally

(29:04) asking you your body but stop happens like sometimes you be like out at a party happens yeah it happens it just

(29:10) happens and be like damn like that's you know how it is you're at a party sometimes and you're just hanging out and then walk in people you

(29:17) slept sexual intercourse with at the party it's if you have a small circle

(29:25) like it's it's it's sometimes you see people out it's how many how many people in the small circle have you had

(29:32) sex god damn imagine Like A to point out for example like a college campus like

(29:38) people in college be doing craziness like you B you bound to see somebody there like you should like you know like

(29:44) it's not like that look uh okay um I'm still not sure

(29:49) why it's weird I have a question for the ladies though um would

(29:55) you date a guy who had SE with men no like they're

(30:01) bisexual yeah sure he previously had sex with men would you date him

(30:10) um I've never really thought about it think about it right now I mean as long as like I don't see

(30:18) what difference it would make if they're by okay are you by no I'm straight what

(30:24) about you um um I've been close I've like kissed aexual would you

(30:32) have a long-term relationship with a guy who's had sex with men yeah I think I could do it you she thinks she could do

(30:39) it I think I could do it what about you hard no but hold on what's that's not any of your business that's his kind of

(30:46) value judgment is that that is a value judgment yeah sorry nope that no that is

(30:52) my business because that same individual's thing has been in like a man's thing and it's a really my

(30:58) business well wait a second yeah there's a little cognitive

(31:04) dissonance going on here cuz you're saying you have no right to know my past and what I ever did yeah

(31:12) my my Straight heterosexual path so then what if you're what if you're hanging out and you're dating a guy and you

(31:17) really like him and he's like he's like the one and he spends the $10,000 a month on you the whole nine you know

(31:24) what I mean and you and you just and one day you just like pick up the phone and this guy's like yeah it's Chuck and I

(31:29) used to sleep with this dude would you dump him immediately it sounds like a value

(31:36) judgment it does sound like a value Jud Jud call it what you want I can't beat with a M like that I'm sorry going going

(31:41) around the table would you uh have a long-term relationship with a guy who has with

(31:48) men depends on compatibility in other aspects but no okay but no okay

(31:55) yes I'm pretty sure that's a no absolutely not are we supposed to answer this one I

(32:02) don't know okay um well okay so um some of you said body count does matter some

(32:08) of you said body count doesn't matter shouldn't matter don't object to men caring about body count so it begets the

(32:15) question what's your body count starting with you over a 100 from you going this

(32:22) way I'm not answering because I think that should be private between me and my

(32:27) boyfriend I thought you said body count doesn't matter shouldn't matter I mean I don't no I also said it's no one's business

(32:34) you don't have to answer okay what about you um I'm genuinely not sure range

(32:42) like or over X number like no more than 20 so 15 to 20 I would say Okay decline

(32:51) the question I thought body count didn't matter it's nobody's business okay ditto

(32:59) private zero waiting for marriage I'm sorry you spoke you got guys please we

(33:05) do need you to speak I said zero I'm waiting for marriage oh that's really nice good for you beautiful it's

(33:11) beautiful it's marriage okay it's interesting though you guys say body count doesn't matter

(33:17) but uh you do refuse to answer the question I find that interesting I think

(33:22) privacy the my right to my privacy is what is important to me and I don't want

(33:28) to share it on the internet that's fine that's fine I do think it's I have I have a question too that I'm just

(33:35) curious about kind of folding into this my my question is I I can respect your position but then this podcast is in

(33:42) famous for sometimes Infamous for asking these questions you know so I wouldn't go on it if that was my position yeah

(33:49) but I had the option to decline to answer well I suppose you could decline to answer every single question we ask

(33:55) you but yeah and then I'd probably like would never come back here like get

(34:00) invited back some things just don't need to be on the internet like if you wanted to be on the internet you're not you don't have to answer the question it's

(34:06) fine it's just like it kind of you know your whole position of well body count shouldn't really matter men

(34:11) shouldn't really care about it but I also really want to reserve that information because you think you'll be

(34:20) judged on it why I have a different question I'm curious about so all of you

(34:25) guys almost unanimously said if a guy had ever been with a another guy that's

(34:30) like no right off the gate which by the way is awesome but let's let Andrew stop

(34:35) you're going to get cancelled dude they're going to cancel you let me ask this let me ask this a different way should a guy be able to or should

(34:44) should a guy get together with a woman who has had same activity with another

(34:49) woman with a woman so a woman it's the same activity with a woman should a man

(34:55) get together with her men love that double standards double standards hello

(35:02) um it's a little different oh it is it don't you think so what no what's the

(35:07) difference from the if the standard is that you you had a safe sex relationship

(35:13) so that's a noggo but if this sex had a same sex relationship that's AOK okay what's I mean that's up to you you know

(35:20) what I mean if that bothers you but I don't think it bothers most men yeah I mean maybe not but we're still holding

(35:26) the standard here right what makes it a nogo for you guys if a man was in a same-sex relationship for you not to

(35:32) date him what what is that force that drives you where you're like no um I think masculinity and femininity

(35:41) are very different so when it comes to samex relationships with men like men and then women I just think it's a lot

(35:50) more it's a lot it's a bigger leak to to go same sex with a man than that doesn't

(35:56) really answer the question at all like the question specifically

(36:01) is this same sex activity between two men you're like noo right mhm okay fair

(36:08) enough why because it's very uh

(36:14) emasculating in my op that's that's pretty that's kind of

(36:20) as emasculating as it could get that's it it's just it's just a masculinity issue yeah I think so there's no other I

(36:27) mean yeah I mean let's not get into that but but there is right there's other underlying reasons there sure but that's

(36:33) you know and also I don't know if that would apply to female same seex situations why cuz there's different

(36:42) uh body parts getting involved yeah I'm not I'm

(36:47) just I still I just don't understand the standard I guess if I can jump in on that though so if you guys are kind of

(36:54) repulsed by the thought of doing that then

(37:00) like the thought of you doing that with other men that's kind of how we feel we

(37:06) look at it right to draw it to draw it all home that's the same way that we

(37:11) would feel the opposite way you guys being with other M it's it's not a perfect it's not perfect I mean I I it

(37:18) doesn't map on one to one but you could get the preference here get it right I understand and that's kind of why I'm

(37:24) like I I I don't really encourage promiscuity like I actually prefer to be like with one person for long extended

(37:31) periods of time that's beautiful but great to each his own like it's your body know speaking of which this is

(37:37) actually why I refuse to date a woman who who's had sex on camera with another

(37:45) man speaking of Shawn Evans call back to two hours ago if a woman has had sex

(37:51) with a man on camera that is a 100% a deal breaker for me you're out do you

(37:57) like a home or old you are out a out you go AA where's where's my Soldier wait

(38:04) how did how did that get turned on do you mean like do you mean like a private movie or like only

(38:10) fans no he's talking about like public for public for Public public viewing

(38:15) yeah yeah of course of course you said you wanted to discuss age gaps in dating and what is appropriate so why don't we

(38:21) start with you and I will open it up to the whole panel go ahead that's a good question um I think

(38:31) if the age Gap is relatively large and I know this can be

(38:37) subjective it does definitely rub me the wrong way whether it's the man that's

(38:42) younger or the woman that's way younger like in both ways it just feels a little

(38:48) bit predatory predatory okay I think before we weigh in on that I I do want

(38:54) to get the answer from the rest of the panel so you think it's a bit predatory do you want to add to your answer at all

(39:00) or um no I'll like let everyone else okay so you think you feel it's weird

(39:05) you think it's predatory okay um it gives me icky Vibes icky it

(39:12) gives you iy vies vibes okay how much of an age Gap are we talking I mean that's

(39:20) up to the each individual but um I don't know well you're currently in an age Gap relationship isn't that correct some

(39:27) something like that what do you mean well you said you're you're 22 he's 32 right around there so that what do you

(39:34) mean around there he's older than 32 like 10 15 years older than me how

(39:39) old is just say how old he is I don't know people are watching I don't put people in Blast um but like what's the age you got like 14 years okay so you're

(39:48) 22 so he's 36 about there yeah maybe it's more okay we'll just here yeah

(39:55) you're friends with her do you object to her relationship do you think her relationship is

(40:01) predatory well so i' I've met wait did you just say a little bit what no no no no no no no no I mean

(40:07) like I I might have heard wrong but it sounded like you whispered a little bit no no no I was saying like no it's not

(40:15) predatory so you're friends with her she's dating this guy do you think that that's a predatory relationship well

(40:21) having actually met this person and like gotten to know him no so of course it

(40:27) does depend on so it's okay for your friends to date have age gaps I didn't say that for me I also said it was

(40:35) subjective how big of the age Gap it is well it's it's a what if it was four years older than he is now then would it

(40:41) be too much I don't think that's a large age Gap though what's large for me a large age Gap is if they're within 5

(40:48) years of like one of my parents ages so like my my youngest parent is my stepdad

(40:55) he's 40 so so yeah I guess 35 would be

(41:00) at the like pushing it like that's a pretty big age Gap so me personally I don't object to as long as they're both

(41:08) adults um but I would say that most people who do object to age gaps would

(41:13) probably find her age Gap relationship objectionable she's

(41:19) 22 I don't I don't find it objectionable but I think a lot of people would or that who object to age gaps would she's

(41:26) 22 a 36-year-old 14e age Gap and in this case you just said it's okay

(41:33) because older guys anyway I was still like I was still a little bit concerned

(41:39) like wanting to know what his intentions were so I like it does depend on the

(41:44) person at the end of the day like you can make these so then they're not predatory then no I mean they can't be

(41:50) predatory if they're not Predator right they're only predatory based on the individuals right yeah so that could be

(41:55) true about a 22-year-old 2 three-year-old could be predatory so just for context I mean I was interested

(42:01) in somebody before who was a little bit older than 35 36 and that felt very

(42:10) predatory um because the individual involved because of the individ but you said you were interested in him well

(42:16) both vice versa right but I'm saying the dynamic itself kind of felt very predatory right like why like you know

(42:23) like we just didn't have anything in common like going out the looks sorry going out the looks what do you mean the

(42:31) looks you know because but you said you were interested in him we were both I

(42:36) was we were both interested in each other but I'm saying like that relationship compared to like this one

(42:41) now feels very different like I don't really even notice the age Gap but I do

(42:47) prefer older men like I don't think I could date somebody my age okay but so why was that specific

(42:55) one predatory we didn't have anything in common so if you don't have something in like so

(43:01) let's say a 2 interested but let's say let's say a 23 and a 22-year-old have

(43:06) nothing in common that was just one of the things is it predatory to not have anything in common no no no that was

(43:11) just one of the things um he didn't he like aged poorly so like but you said

(43:17) you were interested in him I was how was him aging poorly mean he's predatory no no no no I said I said it it felt weird

(43:24) like maybe maybe feeling weird is a better a better better way to describe it but the dynamic just did not flow

(43:30) very well um but you said and it felt inappropriate yeah but that's the part the inappropriate predatory whatever

(43:37) that is right right because I think um when I first started um engaging with

(43:42) this person um I kind of had a blinders on to you know the actual age Gap itself

(43:47) because everything was just going so great and so quickly um you ignored the age in Li of

(43:53) what and in L of stuff and [ __ ] stuff and things just just it was very was it

(43:58) for stuff and things it was very exciting was it for stuff and things did you ignore the age gap for stuff and

(44:05) things I would say more experiences it was very exciting but experiences like

(44:10) stuff and things I'll just give an examp I hope he's not watching this I really do um so like what was this last

(44:18) February I was intending to go to New York for Spring Break um with my friends

(44:24) and I was just chatting to him about it and he was like no don't go by yourself

(44:30) like I'll arrange the whole trip and arranged like a weekday at a beautiful here come here

(44:37) comes the things let's hear about the things it was just like an unforgettable experience you know but a lot of attention to detail like it was like wow

(44:45) you know so for the material gains you ignor the hang on hang on for the material gains you ignored the age right

(44:51) but he was also a really really funny guy addressed very well too it's just after a while I was just like this is is

(44:57) not going to work you know I'm not very attracted to you at all so for the material gains I never told him to do

(45:04) this he did this for me you know right no I get it but I'm just saying like

(45:09) well you know I'm not attracted to you right this isn't really going anywhere but thanks for the [ __ ] right like I

(45:16) mean come right is that basically what happened I mean after a while yes it did Fizz out yes correct but compared to

(45:23) this one this one is like fresh and like sexy

(45:28) okay getting everybody else's thoughts on age Gap relationships General answer

(45:35) no again it depends on the individuals involved well of course but I

(45:43) me I mean again keeping it genuine there are times like if I saw a 50-year-old man

(45:52) dating an 18-year-old girl admittedly I'd get the ick wait hold wait wait

(45:57) sorry an older man dating a what like an 18-year-old girl oh 18-year-old girl okay that being said um actually

(46:05) listening to you on this podcast I have learned I need to set aside my feelings and think about okay what is the

(46:12) morality of the situation so if I look at that no problemo they problem problem right so this is the thing right all the

(46:19) objections are always just I don't like this why I don't know

(46:26) and it's just like like well then I don't give a [ __ ] right just that's that's just me I think the only valid maybe like

(46:33) argument you could make there is like your cognitive function isn't quite set in until you're about 25 no that's not

(46:39) even true for everybody I heard that was fake news it is fake news in fact the series of sociological studies which he

(46:45) would be referencing to bring up the cognitive disparity between no these are sociological

(46:52) studies Neuroscience especially will be the this inside the neuroscientific field especially what you're talking

(46:59) about is one specific part of the brain which isn't fully developed in a human adult female until they're 26 prefrontal

(47:05) cortex is that it that's that one part but the thing is is like but how much

(47:11) does it does it diminish your cognitive ability by 1% I mean it rings true for me I I I do feel like once I got to

(47:17) about 25 like yeah but you have a whole ton of experience a lot more ability to

(47:24) to make better decisions but the problem with this is let's assume for a second that every

(47:29) year you got older it increased your cognitive ability or whatever by 1% or 2% or something like this some you know

(47:36) kind of smallish uh type percentage now let's assume that that never occurred it

(47:42) just stopped at 2% less than what it is now or 1% less than it is now and you had the same exact 10 years of

(47:48) experience you would still be way smarter than you would be when you were 16 or 18 or 19 or 20 you would still be

(47:56) so the the question becomes is it experience or is it the fact that your brain's not completely 100% developed

(48:03) until you're 26 years old that just seems absurd to me it's like you weren't that much smarter at 26 than you were at

(48:09) 24 or even at 22 obviously it's Progressive you know yeah that's why I'm saying but is it Progressive due to

(48:15) experience or because your your brain isn't completely developed till you're 26 that's the question I mean I think

(48:21) that is what the studies show is that your pref frontal cortex kind of completely it's it's that's not even

(48:27) true for can we google the the whole like 25 there's multiple there's multiple

(48:34) data samples on this and no it's not showing that you somehow get the like

(48:39) when you turn 26 the day you turn 26 you're like oh Eureka my brain's done developing now I can go get that man

(48:47) that I want that does that just seem absurd on its face no I don't think it's like a happens in one night right well

(48:53) it doesn't happen it happens it's a gradual transition but if you're 23 versus 26 how much more intelligent are

(49:01) you because of your brain development that's the question I think it's a question of experience versus 26 I think

(49:06) that's I think everybody but that's a question of experience not necessarily a question of brain function so I'm saying

(49:13) that both the distinction between your brain at 18- 26 you'd have to demonstrate that it's so significant

(49:19) that if you were to leave it the same and give the same amount of experience between those two ages there'd be some massive difference that's what those

(49:25) studies fail to show that's my whole problem with it I mean I I haven't actually looked at studies I

(49:30) don't know if you have but I have this would this comes up quite often and that's my whole problem with it is like

(49:37) well let's let's see what would happen if if we were able to demonstrate well we stopped it from 20 to 26 and they

(49:44) have the exact same experiences how much of a different person would they be that's a much larger question so I'm not

(49:49) willing to just say well because the brain's not fully developed the day they turn 26 they can go get what the I think

(49:56) at least you would agree that you know an 18-year-old probably isn't as as good at making uh judgments as a as a 25 26

(50:04) then should they be able to vote against a 26-year-old and cancel out their very well-informed vote I mean I I don't know

(50:11) I'm haven't thought know well if they should if you're saying that well the experience of an 18-year-old woman is

(50:17) such that she could never make the same type of judgment call that a 50-year-old man can fair enough then why should she

(50:25) be able to cancel out his vote I mean I I I've never stated that that I believe that she that's why I asked

(50:32) should she I I mean I don't know I haven't thought about it well you should think about it because this is the same type of argument it's like at what point

(50:39) are they an adult and if they're an adult are they an adult or are they not and if they're not when are they and if

(50:44) they're not what responsibility should they have or shouldn't they have CU I don't I'm not willing to be like well

(50:49) Johnny you can go to war but you can't go after a 50-year-old woman it's like well no not so sure I'm willing to make

(50:55) that call or you know hey Tim yeah sure you got drafted but you can't smoke till you're 21 because well society's just

(51:02) said it gives him the ick right it gives him the ick that you smoked himy now go

(51:08) over and fight the enemies of the United States that just seems absurd to me you know what I mean so when I look at it

(51:13) I'm like I mean I agree with that yeah if this is an experience-based thing well 18-year-old woman could be drafted

(51:19) if an 18-year-old woman was drafted then is she cognitive enough and smart enough to go out with a 50y old man should be dra drafted at all I think women should

(51:26) but if they were but let's just say that they were that they should be drafted women like men were drafted it's like

(51:32) there's a war right we need you in the field you're drafted just like 18-year-old Johnny over there okay I can

(51:39) she go for a 50-year-old man then is she is she smart enough then to make those decisions I think legally she should be

(51:46) able to I I agree with the legal age of 18 to set some age so what's the moral argument well the moral argument is like

(51:53) everything is has is Nuance so I mean you have to look at every moral argument is that everything is

(51:59) Nuance I'm saying things have Nuance so I know things have Nuance but there's no we're just talking like okay here's

(52:05) stock 18-year-old girl and stock 15 50-year-old man like I think there's a reason why people may get uncomfortable

(52:11) when they hear that and I think it's valid it probably comes out of a real do you think that your grandparents were uncomfortable with that your

(52:17) great-grandparents were uncomfortable with that cuz the answer is not really it was not a not a huge social issue of

(52:23) the time I I think it has been actually no it hasn't been it was never a big social issue that there was these large

(52:30) age gaps I know back like like probably like 2,000 years ago it wasn't well let

(52:35) me give you a different example let's see World War II by the end of World War II France's male population been

(52:42) decimated mostly the young men because they just had two World Wars the female population wasn't

(52:49) decimated age gaps were pretty wide right by necessity how you going to procreate right there's no other men

(52:56) except ccept these is it immoral then I'm not saying it's I've never made the

(53:01) blant statement that it's immoral though right so I mean if it's but is it situationally immoral or is it just

(53:07) really that it gives you the ick I think it's situationally immoral like to try

(53:13) it's a slightly different situation but I'll try and make an example you know if there's a kid like I have to be responsible with

(53:20) with uh someone who's a minor in in other dimensions do you know what I'm saying no but I want to be charitable to

(53:27) what you're saying so I'm trying to think of a good example but like a minor another di do you mean like their

(53:34) cognitive function is if they're 18 is like that of a 15y old you have to look out for people younger than you and and

(53:40) there's definitely a chance to take advantage of their innocence so I think that's some that I think that's

(53:45) generally what we're getting at you know what I'm saying yeah but you don't there doesn't even need to be an age gap for

(53:51) that you just take advantage of them anyway at the same age can take advantage of them I mean there's

(53:56) obviously a serious problem with taking advantage of people who are much younger than you because their lack of experience but there would be a serious

(54:03) problem for anybody to take advantage of anybody for any reason right what do you mean so like let's say a 50-year-old guy

(54:10) is taking advantage of the ni of a 19-year-old girl in order to I don't know get her do whatever the hell it is

(54:16) that he wants versus a 21-year-old guy I see why it's immoral Mor moral just because the guy is 50 versus 21 I don't

(54:23) see what the difference is I would think he would know better better than the 21y old but but I'm just saying it seems

(54:29) like it's just equally bad to me doesn't seem like there's this was more bad to that because like a 20-year old

(54:35) 20-year-old doesn't have as much experience as a 50-year-old I think they would know better just my general sense get yeah I get it I understand what

(54:42) you're saying but you could have a 25-year-old and a 24-year-old girl and

(54:47) he is vastly more intelligent and vastly more experienc than she is usually not though but you could right and there's

(54:54) no ick there the only would be in the distinction for age and it's only due to like some kind of preference but if we

(55:01) were to look at the immoral action a 50-year-old man takes advantage of 19-year old girl it's like oh yeah

(55:06) that's bad but if 21-year-old takes advantage of 18-year-old girl that's still just as bad and also as a

(55:13) 50-year-old man wouldn't you want somebody who has a little more experience I don't know what their preferences are but the question the

(55:19) question to me is not even the question to me is not why do you prefer this

(55:24) thing X but whether or not is this thing even a problem so is it actually even a

(55:29) problem that a 50-year-old might you usually see people together who are roughly the same age I think that's

(55:35) because they grew up in the same era that as peers you tend to be able to

(55:41) connect on a lot more so I think maybe that's why okay maybe something's off there maybe that's a red FL unless this Social Circle becomes reduced due to

(55:48) external external factors like for instance War if 40 or 50% of your male population young male population totally

(55:55) decimated now you have these extreme age gaps now it's necessary so in that case is that

(56:01) okay yeah I think that's fair well then if that's okay you're really just saying there's nothing really immoral here I

(56:07) never said it was never if there's nothing immoral then why do we care that's my question it's definitely a red

(56:12) flag okay well now that's fair right you can say it's a red flag or something that you would look out for that's fair

(56:18) enough but I'm just saying I don't see a problem with it per se not necessarily which I've SE so your thoughts

(56:26) uh I think as long as both parties are consenting adults and it's fine there you have it there you have it going back

(56:32) to some of you who said that you find it predatory or icky do you care to

(56:38) elaborate on your answers how is it predatory so well I'd like to not

(56:47) exactly change my answer but I'll add more I think it's different if two people meet they don't know how old they

(56:52) are they happen to have a connection and then you know like it it just it happens happens to be a pretty large age Gap but

(56:58) if like an older man and older woman is purposefully going on dating apps and making their age range very young like

(57:06) purposely looking for these younger women that's when it feels pretty predatory cuz you're actively seeking

(57:12) someone way younger than you or if you have some type of age cut off wait an age cut off yeah like if

(57:19) you're like oh I don't want so you would you date a 70-year-old man no what are you doing with this age cut off no I'm

(57:26) if you didn't know his age it would make it okay then right he only thought he was 45 no but what I'm saying is like

(57:33) let's say you meet someone and they happen to be I don't know whatever age kind like a

(57:41) lot of men have like 30 or yeah like 30 they're older than 30 and you're like no

(57:47) even though they're closer to your own age that means you want them to be significantly younger than you so what

(57:52) if a man he's in his 40s he wants to start a family okay he hasn't been able to for whatever reason okay maybe he's

(57:59) been like longterm in the military maybe he has other things going on right he has not been able to but he's accruit a

(58:04) ton of resources so he starts researching goes online he's like how can I have a nice big family what are

(58:11) the things I should be looking for do you think fertile woman would be like one of those big criteria for

(58:18) that if you want to have a family fertility in women would be a big one right what are the other options yeah

(58:26) well first of all there even though the percentage of women that are still fertile is less as they get older there

(58:33) still are some or if you really want children if you wanted to have nine kids

(58:38) you probably wouldn't want to marry a 30-year-old right but if you want children that badly you could adopt

(58:45) adoption yeah but you could also marry a 25-year-old there are also women who freeze their eggs yeah I know but but

(58:51) what if you again you could just marry a fertile 25-year-old too he could be a

(58:57) 40-year-old man and go well he's 25 so I get the maximum amount of fertility I want to have seven eight kids but then

(59:03) why weren't you trying to start that family maybe just because you were trying to acrw resources so you could

(59:09) and then if the 25-year-old says yeah you have the resources I really dig you I think you're great uh I want to give

(59:15) you nine kids I could not imagine anybody at this table could ever give me

(59:20) a single problem with that from a moral standpoint ever I don't think it would even be possible

(59:26) wait I have a question so well let's let her respond before do

(59:32) you have a response he's well I I want to hear what H is say no no no no no no no no so Andrew said

(59:40) he doesn't think anybody at this table would be able to raise an objection over I don't think anybody in this country

(59:46) could raise an objection to this from a moral standpoint that would be in any way coherent but I would love to hear it

(59:52) I if I can add on to your question without raising an actual argument or objection

(1:00:00) do you find the scenario that he painted predatory or icky 40-year-old

(1:00:09) 25-year-old a little bit Yeah okay a 40-year-old with a

(1:00:16) 25-year-old correct um her prefrontal cortex is fully developed at this point

(1:00:21) bear in mind close enough anyway um no no

(1:00:27) no no who cares they're both happy yeah it's Beau it's beautiful go ahead what's

(1:00:32) your question so I was just asking for a friend do you think it's do you think

(1:00:37) that from a woman's perspective having kids at 25 with

(1:00:43) someone who is 40 is disadvantageous I can't figure out how

(1:00:49) it would be disadvantageous from a logical standpoint it could be from um some kind of preferential stand how old

(1:00:56) is Henry Caville caval they could say for instance um 40

(1:01:03) wait can can I jump in here really quick you're you know who Henry caval is Nick

(1:01:09) could you Google Henry Cav said Superman Superman Superman yeah thanks uh The Witcher the tutors if anybody I don't

(1:01:16) know if anybody knows the great actor oh I know him yeah uh very handsome man 40

(1:01:21) years old didn't he play Superman too yeah Superman yeah so what what was your

(1:01:27) question the 40 year-old and the 25-year old I was asking do you think it's disadvantageous for a 25y old woman to

(1:01:33) have babies let me ask do you think it would be disadvantage disadvantageous for a 25-year-old woman to have ch

(1:01:39) children with Henry caval no do you think do you think a lot of 25-year-old women would jump at the chance to be

(1:01:46) with Henry C hang forget that for a second let me ask this easier let's say for somehow I don't know how okay but

(1:01:54) they were they froze sperm from a guy from 1915 who died okay 1915

(1:02:02) they had the Frozen sperm and a woman wanted to become a mother right and she looked through and

(1:02:08) she's like oh I really want this guy from 1915 want to have his babies right and

(1:02:14) so she like artificially inseminated herself and she had the baby okay well

(1:02:20) didn't she actually have a child then with a dude who's like over 100 years

(1:02:27) old no no well wait I'm a little confused by this one myself didn't she

(1:02:35) if you freeze the sperm uh right they're like they're frozen yeah so it's not

(1:02:41) like it's this 100y old like living man it's his 18yearold sperm or something I guess well what if it's his 50-year-old

(1:02:49) sperm I don't know that seems like what if they froze it when

(1:02:54) he's 90 but it's just sperm it's not like you're having intercourse yeah you

(1:03:00) don't have a relationship with that person and like what you were saying earlier so then if if that's true then

(1:03:05) is that saying that you can be in a relationship with an 80-year-old man and

(1:03:11) as long as you don't have a intercourse with him and you're just like I don't know he off in a cup and you inseminate

(1:03:16) yourself then that relationship then is fine or no no this this what I mean like

(1:03:23) think that I think that she says kinds of nuance and I'm like let's see if we can find the craziest Nuance we can an

(1:03:30) 80-year-old off in a cup is pretty crazy it's pretty nuanced yeah pretty nuanced

(1:03:35) yeah but can can I ask you something so you were grilling hie a little bit when she was talking about wanting these like

(1:03:42) material things from a man blah blah whatever and then she brought up

(1:03:49) children and you were like that's a material thing as well and now you're saying material conditions for children

(1:03:55) yeah yeah now you're saying so you're like oh it's wrong I don't know if this is what you meant but this is how it

(1:04:01) sounded like that it's not good to just seek someone for these material things

(1:04:06) but then in your scenario when you're talking about this 40-year-old man actively seeking someone younger just

(1:04:11) for the material thing being the children that you what happened is she asked would it be

(1:04:17) disadvantageous for a 25-year-old woman right to um get you know get married to

(1:04:24) a 40-year-old man and have his baby babies I can't think of how that would be disadvantageous but I'm talking about what we were talking about like a couple

(1:04:30) hours ago yeah but you're conflating two different things so the question which was asked is how would this be disadvantageous I don't see how it could

(1:04:37) be disadvantageous I mean I don't think it's disadvantageous per

(1:04:42) se but I still think that like if the only reason you're

(1:04:49) trying to like build a relationship with someone younger than you is to have children with them then that's like why

(1:04:56) would you do that to perpetuate to perpetuate the human species so people like you can be alive no but the other

(1:05:02) core values that you were talking about earlier like integrity and loyalty and all that like you can have all of those things together you can but what if you

(1:05:10) can't find that and you only find like that's pretty hard to find

(1:05:16) virtuously okay so you mean what happens if you can't find a virtuous woman at the age of 25 yeah so are you just going

(1:05:22) to settle for someone who you don't have that same connection with but they're 25

(1:05:27) children or would you rather be with someone who's older so now if you want to make the

(1:05:34) shift from whether or not it's dis advantageous and you're talking specifically about the core of

(1:05:39) relationship Dynamic for preference and you're like is it is the preference for

(1:05:44) this guy to to only have nine kids if that's the case then I guess he could compromise on his values but if the

(1:05:50) preference is not that if the preference is he wants to have nine kids and a virtuous woman then yeah he might have

(1:05:56) to compromise on his standards I don't see how he how he wouldn't be you know I mean as far as looks and this type of

(1:06:03) thing or am I misinterpreting your question or am I getting something wrong here well just cuz you were saying that

(1:06:10) like a 40-year-old man who really wants a family like really really badly

(1:06:16) they're going to only look at younger women because they have a higher chance of being fertile and being able to give

(1:06:23) you those CH no I'm not saying they only would but I would why they would can I play Devil's Advocate from my original

(1:06:28) point on this topic so if I am an hot 25-year-old woman okay and this

(1:06:36) 40-year-old man wants me to have his kids don't you think that he should be

(1:06:41) providing for us to have for me to even consider having his kids or no I think

(1:06:47) that he should be in a position in which he can provide for the children and his family especially at almost 15 get 15

(1:06:52) years older M does that mean taking to the Bahamas and giving you $10,000 or I

(1:06:58) never said give $110,000 is that $110,000 a month for you to go ziplining and hang lighing that's providing for

(1:07:04) you and the kids no no it's not no it's not y'all taking my words out of my mouth what I'm just saying I'm just

(1:07:09) saying is like at that dinosaur age you

(1:07:15) should wow you you should be doing more than if I'm gonna go have kids with

(1:07:21) somebody my age that's just my take that you should be doing more yeah do you

(1:07:26) think that do you think that a man who is in his 40s who by your own admission is going to have more resources than man

(1:07:32) at 25 you'd have you don't you think he'd be better to provide for your children no that's what I'm saying yeah

(1:07:37) well then he is doing more no I'm just asking he's just not doing more for you he's doing more for The Offspring

(1:07:44) just not for you so by default that you don't get the pearls you know the the kids get new clothes that's that's how

(1:07:50) it goes you know you don't get the pearls you don't get the big diamond the kids get the School the kids get the

(1:07:56) better education kids get the better life that sounds like a sad life I will just it sounds like a sad

(1:08:02) life to pref to make a the preferences the children over yourself no why can't

(1:08:08) we all have a beautiful life well I mean what you could right you you can't you

(1:08:15) know what you can have it all right you can have five kids and $10,000 Bahama vacations is just kind of everything you

(1:08:22) want it doesn't cost $10,000 princess treatment okay princess treat uh a

(1:08:27) couple questions here dud with bricks with gold in their pockets just waiting they can't wait to have nine nine kids

(1:08:33) oh a couple things here okay no and our family yeah men want women who are passionate and ambitious even if that

(1:08:40) means you know being a a wife and and Homemaker and raising your children

(1:08:46) don't give a [ __ ] about ambition so you don't want to of you that men care about ambition they don't

(1:08:52) care about women's Ambitions so you want to be with somebody who doesn't have any goals in life I didn't say Goals I said ambition you don't need to have be

(1:08:58) ambitious like you amb I don't think you understand what ambition means why don't you tell

(1:09:05) me go ahead tell them what I'm not good at uh definitions

(1:09:11) on the fly at all so I thought I didn't know what it meant what the [ __ ] I mean I I don't

(1:09:17) think you do but just oh I guess well I know you don't I know for sure you don't you

(1:09:23) can't even tell me what it means being able to describe something something and and write you know what it means in a dictionary is not the same thing but you

(1:09:29) you said you asked him he doesn't know what you mean by ambition so he's asking you to Define

(1:09:36) it yeah ambition is having goals I can Google it if you want I can Google that would be great but ambition is having

(1:09:41) goals and and seeking to you know uh rise above where you're at you know building skills you know having a goal

(1:09:49) and trying to reach it Andrew do you when you say you don't men don't care about ambition do you mean it within the context of like career achieve

(1:09:55) achievement academic achievement what I'm talking about is cuz what if a woman's ambitious for a

(1:10:02) family like you would agree that that would be she's she wants well not even

(1:10:07) again we need to kind of narrow down what we mean here when we're talking about ambition so for me when I'm when

(1:10:13) I'm thinking about ambition I'm thinking of I want to have Stellar achievement I want to have something which I'm which

(1:10:20) I'm moving towards which is to rise above some station or to move towards

(1:10:25) this kind of overtly worthy thing generally speaking n man don't give a [ __ ] like if

(1:10:32) you start out a good cook and you end up a good cook they don't fing care they don't care they don't give a [ __ ] they

(1:10:37) don't want you don't need to become a better and better C they don't give a [ __ ] they they don't care like if you're

(1:10:42) just good enough you're good enough they don't give a [ __ ] I've never seen any of them say nope you got to be you got to

(1:10:50) you got to really before hold on I want her I want to give her an opportunity to respond you seem to disagree with Andrew

(1:10:56) do you want to I think generally speaking people

(1:11:02) seek uh a partner who does have goals and goals are what give your life

(1:11:07) meaning can on goals let let me comend but it doesn't have to be job related at

(1:11:13) all so I think something that I have goals I want to I want to be a homestead or I want to I want to raise a family

(1:11:18) like I want to become a better cook you brought up cooking like I think we why does a man care about those goals though

(1:11:24) because you want to be a homesteader because he would like to do so as well for okay so then so it's his goals it's his

(1:11:33) goals but I I think the context of the the context of the conversation is

(1:11:40) occupational career educational achievement that's the context not and

(1:11:46) Andrew maybe has differing views on this I don't object to a woman who is desirous or has goals to having a

(1:11:53) family but I don't think that's what I'm just saying about what what is cared about what the preference is but let's

(1:12:00) keep it within the context of Career Success Financial uh educational achievement men

(1:12:08) in those Realms men don't really care about women's ambition in that regard no

(1:12:14) I think I I I agree on that oh it was just unclear when you said you know men don't care if women have Ambitions I I

(1:12:21) just okay here let's not linger long because I want to try to wrap but for the men so say for example right you

(1:12:27) meet this girl and um she has she's in school for something long term but like

(1:12:33) you guys both mutually decide like y'all want to start settle down and start a family do you think that she should

(1:12:38) forfeit her career for a potential husband and family yeah

(1:12:44) yeah yeah what about you what about me the like what do you

(1:12:52) should do should the woman forfit her career for a potential family and

(1:12:59) husband should she well it depends what the arrangement

(1:13:04) is going to be do you want to have one kid two kid three kids four if if her standard is going to be well while I'm

(1:13:12) pregnant I don't want to be in the workforce and then during those early years I don't want to uh be in the workforce and then I also want to have

(1:13:18) three four five kids you are going to forfeit your career so remember the

(1:13:23) example and well and if I can give my own perspective if I can give my own perspective let's say I want to have

(1:13:30) seven sons uh and I'm a high earner and you want to go pursue your career where at

(1:13:38) the top end of your career you're going to be making $75,000 a

(1:13:43) year and I'm making say I'm making seven seven figures a

(1:13:48) year no think you should take care of the kids

(1:13:56) so why why do that career if I can provide I agree so in the example that

(1:14:02) we were saying like remember the 25-year-old having kids and then the 40-year-old man right so say the 25-year-old is just starting her career

(1:14:08) and all of a sudden The 40-Year-Old wants kids should she just like stop because she's obviously very early in her career should she just should she

(1:14:14) just stop what she's doing yes but you can have a career and have children at

(1:14:19) the same you can also not have a career and take care of your children at the same time you can do both none of these

(1:14:25) are mutually exclusive so her should her should what should what's optimal what's

(1:14:31) optimal is you listen to your 40-year-old husband if he tells you stay the home and watch the kids then you

(1:14:37) stay the home and you watch the kids it's simple if I could play devil's advocate

(1:14:43) for one um you're such a misogynist you are just a mogist and the

(1:14:50) whatever podcast being a feminist platform does not appreciate your

(1:14:56) she ask she just like the ask is what thing should be done if the

(1:15:01) husband wants this thing yes from my worldview yeah you need to do what

(1:15:06) ultimately your husband tells you to do I am sorry I I I do want to try to wrap

(1:15:11) up relatively soon so I'm just going to try to get through some of our last talking points here
