(0:09) what's up
(0:14) everybody happy Wednesday to you all we let people roll in
(0:23) here how are we all guys say like feels like everything and nothing's happening at the moment lots
(0:30) of different things happening around the world but in terms of culture terms of debates not too much happening I think Andrew is kind
(0:37) of keeping us afloat here really not too much going on few are regulars in the chat what's
(0:44) happened in Dan number one moderator in the entire world choer Dustin Damon good to see you
(0:52) all guys we're going to be going through a Wilson debate today guys it's going to be four or five hours of straight
(0:58) streaming it's one of the most brutal debates you've ever seen it's just an
(1:03) absolute beat down a maing a whole entire time which we love to see to be honest we really love to see it because
(1:09) these liberals they absolutely deserve it I want to say thank you very much to
(1:15) the Wilsons and to The Crucible for letting me use their ex their uh exclusive content you guys don't know
(1:20) then the crucial. TV is where they keep all of their debates and that's what we'll be using today so as you can see
(1:27) we are inside here guys we are in inside The Crucible TV in the members only section and they do all kinds of debates
(1:35) here a lot of them don't get kept on YouTube because the blood sport stuff is a little bit to sometimes and right here
(1:43) your boy rattlesnake debating rad pumo on the red pill so we'll stream that soon as well that was a good debate on
(1:50) the red pill so thank you to those guys for letting me use it thank you to you guys for all being here today and with
(1:57) that is this Do's name who he debates it's
(2:03) quite the debate really funny the way that this one starts off guys because this guy thinks he's going to sort of
(2:11) lull Andrew into like a conversational type thing but Andrew's watched his old
(2:16) podcasts with some of the other guys in the sort of conservative space and he's seen that he tries to lull them in with
(2:21) this conversational sort of style and then and then puts them in Corners so Andrew just comes out and goes now we're
(2:27) debating so we may as well start the debate right now that's absolutely brutal the way it
(2:35) [Music] starts you want
(2:41) access so by the way guys if you haven't seen we do he does Tik Tok invasions as
(2:47) well which is fantastic I'm in every single one of them and we just go and troll the [ __ ] out of Libs on Tik Tok
(2:53) I'm going to be doing some myself soon all right let's get into
(2:58) it I think we're good good let me know if you guys can hear it all good the volume is all good in the chat well
(3:04) first of all uh nice to meet you rob no actually recommended that I reach out to you because we had a a little discussion
(3:11) uh a couple weeks ago and scripture came up and he said you were more qualified to uh to talk about that particular
(3:18) issue but uh I guess we should just do first interviews or Impressions here so
(3:23) like I'm not super familiar with you so how did you get involved with politics religion how did you get involved with
(3:29) content creation um by accident so I I dove in by a complete accident there was lockdowns
(3:35) going on and to joined a Facebook group started debating on that Facebook group and some of those debates began to uh go
(3:42) viral it started a YouTube channel Andrew is is not here to make a friend you can see and so have you always been
(3:48) politically this is stuff that I just ask everybody that I talk to but like what got what first got you into politics was your family political is it
(3:54) something that you got from college my dad was always my dad was always a he was born based he was based conservative
(3:59) Awesome from the get-go Hate's Progressive with a passion which is exactly what he should and um yeah
(4:06) that's basically uh you know B basically I come from a long line of conservatives who
(4:12) loathe progressives and Communists of all all stripes and types well we share we share a hatred of
(4:19) Communists but but I I'm sorry to disappoint come on dude yeah I listen to your Rob no debate I listen to it it's
(4:26) like so like I know that so here's the tactic right I've seen this tactic a million times before from Liberal
(4:33) Progressive scumbags it works like this they go hey let's do an interview in order to catch you off guard and then it
(4:39) really becomes a debate view right so that's that's how it actually ends up going uh in this case they can generally
(4:46) prepare for you but you're not prepared for them um having known this tactic for a long time because I've been in the
(4:52) sphere a long time of course I prepared ahead of time and took a look at a lot of your content including your debate
(4:57) with Rob no which I reviewed light live on stream and not only were you drubbed thoroughly
(5:03) as well you should have been for your stupid takes but uh on top of that right
(5:08) it was very clear that you were guiding the conversation towards a debate and what you're looking for is an angle to
(5:13) move in on so why don't we just skip with the [ __ ] and get right to the debate so to be to be clear like I don't
(5:21) actually seek out blood sport type debates I am interested in having normal conversations and I compartmentalize
(5:28) with people so I can have like I don't dislike Rob like I think his opinions are wrong but I don't think he's like an
(5:34) evil person and I'm definitely not trying to farm Clips or so he is absolutely right about this this is
(5:40) exactly what these liberal types tend to do they'll say we just want to have a good faith discussion just come in I'll
(5:45) ask you a few questions and and we'll have a good chat and it's just not how it works what they'll do is they'll have a bunch of old tweets like Piers Morgan
(5:52) type style interview stuff and they'll have a bunch of old tweets and and clips of them and then they'll find their angle and they'll try and sort of put
(5:59) them in a cor that he's ahead of it here or Farm clout or anything like that um
(6:05) but if you want to take an adversarial tone I suppose we can we can go down that road well we're adversaries you're
(6:10) a Neo you're a neoliberal shill man like what how would a guy like me not be
(6:15) adversarial with you your secular values are responsible for the destruction of the United States
(6:21) essentially what what did what did I discuss what did I say in my discussion with Rob that gave you the impression
(6:27) that I favored neoliberal politics well because status quo shill you're going for the typical status quo of lgbtq
(6:34) Rights egalitarianism all the same neocon [ __ ] and neol [ __ ] we've been hearing for 60 years neoliberal
(6:41) politics is in my understanding is is more an economic philosophy no it's not
(6:47) it's also a social policies social policies tie right in to neoconservatism
(6:53) neoliberalism neoliberalism new liberalism or a new conservatism which no longer new but more product of the
(7:00) 90s are liberals and conservative holdouts who basically stay about 10 years behind the progressive curve and
(7:07) that's about where you're at so you would have kind of the milk toast fin sitting position uh of well it's nuanced
(7:13) it's a little bit nuanced yes it's true that I'm for all the lgbtq [ __ ] but it's very nuanced my take but it's not
(7:20) really nuanced just over 700 of you guys in the chat now guys
(7:26) 742 we are going to be reading out super chats periodically so if you have anything you want to ask about the debate we can stop and uh we can chat
(7:32) about it every every so every little while well I think I think oftentimes in
(7:37) life things are complicated and so it's not always as simple as giving a yes or
(7:42) no answer on a question you have to describe I mean certainly you would agree with that I would assume no I don't I think that most things are
(7:48) pretty black and white well it is true that there's Nuance I think that that what's what I I call unnecessary
(7:54) Progressive Nuance is when there's so much Nuance that you can't even get to the issue you can't even get to the
(7:59) issue because it's so nuanced that um you know we have to go through endless
(8:04) amounts of garbage to just get to what it is that we're actually talking about which is annoying everybody hates it
(8:10) it's one of the reasons why people hate Progressive so much uh is because it's really hard to have a straight conversation with them because
(8:17) essentially almost every other word out of their mouth is a lie what would you like to have a straight conversation about today well
(8:23) let's piggy back off of what you had with Rob no on transgender and transgender rights and what it is that
(8:30) you were saying there is it your position that we should affirm the
(8:36) identities of these people it's my position that we I'm not
(8:42) certainly an expert when it comes to like childhood developmental psychology do do do you have a academic background
(8:48) in that sort of a thing well we don't need to appeal to Authority for this see see what I mean by unnecessary Nuance
(8:53) just give me your position dude my position is that I defer to people that have observed D these
(9:00) children in a clinical setting and Report the findings I ask anything about
(9:05) children I didn't say a word about children okay if you want to talk just I asked about affirming trans identity I
(9:12) didn't say a word about children at all sure that's the conversation I had with
(9:17) Rob so I thought that's where you were going with it but if you want to talk like broadly about transgender individuals what we observe in the data
(9:25) that I've looked at is that we have outcomes such as less suicidality and
(9:31) these are things that I these are things that matter to me more they don't matter to you outcomes don't matter to you that
(9:37) see this is what I mean here let me explain how I know outcomes don't matter to you wait hold on just real quick can
(9:42) we do you want to have a conversation where we're like constantly interrupting each other do you want to have some time
(9:47) and space to flesh out what we're say if you would prefer to give a long form answer that's fine but I can already tell you what your position will be go
(9:55) ahead okay so my position as I was saying was that it it my belief that
(10:00) people that live an authentic life a happy life a life where they don't want to kill themselves is a good outcome
(10:07) let's say un living because the platforms we're on sure are are you on YouTube yeah okay so I don't think it's
(10:15) a good outcome when people uh take the extreme measure of unal living themselves I think it's a good thing to
(10:20) be alive good thing to be a human being with human consciousness and witness the
(10:25) world that we live in because I think it's a beautiful world uh I've had the fortunate uh I've had the fortune of being able to travel and see a lot of
(10:31) beauty and I want other people to have these kinds of experiences too and you can't really do that if you want to un alive yourself yeah the problem with
(10:37) this argument so guys as you can see he's slowly starting to walk himself into a trap first of all he thought that
(10:43) he was going to come on here and make a friend he thought he was going to have a nice conversation but you know we know
(10:49) how it goes with these liberals but he's now espousing the harm principle he's
(10:55) saying that I believe that people shouldn't be harmed I believe that people shouldn't want to unive
(11:01) themselves and this is something that's not quantifiable and it's very predictable and just watch how this unfolds you me that comes from you
(11:08) progressives is it's so one-sided and it actually makes no sense if you think about it for 15 seconds let me give you
(11:13) a counter position let us assume for a second that there was a group of white
(11:18) people who wanted to be racist towards black people and if they weren't able to they would un alive themselves would you
(11:24) agree that they should be able to be racist towards black people no because the difference in that thought was that
(11:29) that racism would manifest as harm to other people right and so this is the whole and hang on this is the whole in
(11:35) your argument this interrup I'm going to explain well hang on let me finish my position here the reason the reason that
(11:42) this happened the reason the reason I asked this question boy is because it's always the same answer well no of course
(11:49) not in that case because there's a greater role of harm but you never talk about the harm that comes from people
(11:54) having to affirm something they know is a [ __ ] lie you never talk about that well can you explain that harm yeah we
(12:01) can clearly see that these are men and not women clearly and so as Christians elabor yeah
(12:07) if if as a Christian elor I see um let's say a member of Biden's staff who
(12:14) clearly clearly is not a female and wants to be called a female you are
(12:20) actually requesting that I lie and that would be harmful to Christians wouldn't
(12:25) it sup Sarah ring go ahead go ahead man I'm just
(12:31) saying I already know the position you're going to take go ahead uh I I suppose that would be subjective if you
(12:36) tell me that you're experiencing emotional harm for the simple requests of addressing someone ah in the manner
(12:42) in which they wish to be addressed that's not harm I mean I take you at your word that you're experiencing harm
(12:48) my my observation of that is that it doesn't it doesn't appear to be the case that it makes sense that it would be
(12:53) harmful to you I don't understand that position oh you don't think so so so wait how do you know that it's harmful
(12:58) to the black people if the white people are racist to them well they it's not just about how
(13:05) they feel in that moment when we're talking about racism from uh not talking about systemic or institution I'm just
(13:11) saying that talking about consequences that manifest in all kinds of other ways so this is the uh liberal Nuance pattle
(13:18) that he's talking about here his argument is defeated because he said that well this is harmful to people if
(13:23) they have if they want to un alive themselves because they feel like they're a they're a a woman when they're
(13:29) man Andrew simply just says well if they if these racist people feel like they
(13:35) want to unive themselves if they can't be racist then what's then then then why is that why is that harm not
(13:41) important and then it quickly boils down to but it's my preference it's my preference of what is harmful there's no
(13:47) way to quantify it's just if I think things are harmful then it's harmful the argument is literally destroyed and now
(13:53) he's going to blame it on his camera moving around watch talk about systemic racism don't move the don't move the
(13:59) goal post I'm just saying group of white people who want to be want to say mean things to
(14:06) people simply how people feel you're gonna I already knew where where this is going it's just going to be but what
(14:11) about the systemic what about the systemic things which happen as a consequence of that well you see for one
(14:17) thing you'd see the systemic consequences happen to Christians too but B I'm talking about a group of people who just want to say racist
(14:23) things to black people and there's no other outcome there's no systemic outcomes you still would be against it
(14:30) right when when does it ever end with just simply like words oh so we're gonna do a slippery slope fallacy then well
(14:37) you tell me when does it ever when does it ever end with just gay marriage language was mainstream yeah when does
(14:43) it ever end with just gay marriage Le a lot of larger consequences that go well beyond your subjective experience like
(14:49) gay marriage feeling unpleasant like gay like gay marriage gay marriage is a consequence a
(14:55) slippery as a as a slippery slope where we affirm that at least all these other consequences that were completely uned
(15:01) the slippery in the case of the slippery s uh fallacy when it comes to gay marriages people were saying for decades
(15:08) that to trans people allow no they said well I don't know if they said that we
(15:14) if we allow gay people to get married what's next they're going to want to marry their horses and they're going to want to marry their children no that's
(15:20) not the argument the argument was absolutely the argument that's a that's just a
(15:26) man absolute okay sure we can agree disagree on that we're not going to agree to disagree you're not going to
(15:31) weas your way conservatives make the argument that allowing gay people to marry would mainstream beastiality and
(15:38) pedophilia you can say that that didn't happen all you want I have I've witnessed it I've observed it oh really
(15:44) is that right so they weren't saying that what would happen is that next they would Target children which is exactly
(15:50) what they've done through the trans agenda sorry give me a second that's not
(15:55) what the slippery slope was about now you're gonna yeah I'd be adjusting my camera too if I was you
(16:01) buddy yeah this is not going well and it goes guys this goes for 4 hours and it's just Relentless the entire time it's
(16:07) just a Beatdown let's quickly read some super chats Deon the dude for five bucks says why does manance sound a lot like
(16:13) communist gobbley go absolutely I completely agree it does and Mike for 10
(16:18) bucks says what's up Jake keep up the good work appreciate the super chats guys thank you very much we'll carry on and just uh watch him by some time not
(16:26) change it you're going to change it to only be one to only be one hang on let me finish man I just let you finish your
(16:33) Spiel just let you finish your Spiel okay sure how can you then take this
(16:38) straw man and say only the one position and not the other position there was a whole horde of conservatives who were
(16:44) saying No this would turn into Target targeting children for the purposes of indoctrination into the lgbtq lifestyle
(16:51) we see this social contagion everywhere in society and we see what do we see
(16:56) well a great uptick of people identifying immediately as being lgbtq
(17:02) which is something that Rob pointed out to you the numbers don't even make sense it's such a social contagion you have
(17:07) people identifying as this thing who clearly aren't into any type of same-sex Dynamics whatsoever they just do it as
(17:13) some broad form of solidarity it's a social contagion clearly okay so it's
(17:19) just such a disingenuous argument there his argument is that Christians didn't want gay marriage because they said that
(17:24) people well what people would want to end up marrying their horses no people would want to end up becoming horses
(17:29) that's the problem they become fairies people want to be the horses and also in terms of indoctrination of children what
(17:37) are we saying we're saying it absolutely everywhere and this is exactly what the Christians were calling okay so when we're talking about
(17:44) like slippery slopes again when we go back and we look at the rhetoric that the religious conservative movement was
(17:50) using in the 80s and the 90s when the conversation about gay marriage started to emerge as more and more mainstream it
(17:57) was absolutely the case that they were saying that guys if we've got any members in the chat can we get a beta
(18:02) mail Emoji we've opened up uh Channel memberships as well guys if you want to become a member now is the time at a
(18:09) culture or a society that tolerates homosexual marriage would inevitably lead to other what they would call
(18:16) Abominations or examples of degeneracy like like beastiality and pedophilia or
(18:21) F or any other number of other degeneracy which has come as a consequence of accepting this form of
(18:28) deer in society the gold post is ever moving good to see some somebody who
(18:33) wants to dress up like a furry creature and and do all that stuff has no impact on my life so it just doesn't matter to
(18:40) me I think that's the difference between it is the difference between because what you do is you do as a consequentialist you just ignore you
(18:48) ignore you say that you're really adjusting for outcomes but you're not adjusting for outcomes I just gave you a negative outcome which affects the
(18:54) majority of people on planet Earth as the the majority of religion on planet Earth is Christianity so maybe I
(19:00) misspoke not people but the majority religion huge vast overwhelming percentage of people in the abrahamic
(19:07) face are against this and asking them to lie to affirm this has to be doing them harm it has to be you just give a [ __ ]
(19:14) however if I were to change this back around and say all things equal if there was nothing which was systemic it's just
(19:20) that let's say for a second that um a a bunch of white racists just wanted to say the n-word to black people without
(19:28) there there would be any systemic any any consequence is that okay for them to do so so far as I understand you can use
(19:34) racist language yeah I'm asking you if it's okay I'm asking you if it's okay if you think people should be able to do
(19:41) that broadly speaking I AG I I agree with uh freedom of speech yes so you
(19:46) think so do you think it's a moral position then for for these white guys to call these black guys that name is it
(19:53) a moral position my Nuance coming is it immoral for them to say that
(20:00) I I think morality is up to each individual and and in many cases it depends on what religion they follow if
(20:05) they follow a religion I personally it would violate my morals to use a racial slur right if somebody else is going to
(20:12) use a racial slur it's up to them if they think that that is why would it violate your morals because of what
(20:19) because I don't believe that people should go out of their way to use harmful or hateful language right so you
(20:25) think it would cause you think it would cause harm right if you use that language if you use a slur directed at
(20:32) somebody for their sexuality or their race yeah that could do some harm to someone so couldn't it equally do harm
(20:38) to somebody who felt like they were being forced into a position where they had to lie in order to maintain social normaly if they say so I'm saying I
(20:45) don't understand that I believe I take you at your word that your subjective of
(20:50) experience is feeling let's assume that they're wrong let's assume that they're
(20:55) completely wrong about every this is one of the worst arguments that they that they make and it's really fny because
(21:01) he's just asked him is it immoral to be racist is it immoral for a white guy to
(21:06) call a black guy the nword and this is something that the Liberals will cry about racism systemic racism structural
(21:12) racism but what he's just said is that it's immoral for me but if somebody else
(21:19) thinks it's fine then I guess it's fine because we all have our different subjective world view so there's no real way to quantify it if you want to do it
(21:25) then I guess go ahead that's essentially what he said everything they believe it wouldn't
(21:31) matter they believe that it's a lie so therefore it does them harm yes whether
(21:36) you agree with that or not this is a sub like you said this is subjective to their experience if it is subjective to
(21:43) their experience and that's what emotions are it would be doing them harm right sure and according to their
(21:50) subjective experience I again I take you at your word that it is an uncomfortable painful experience for you psychically
(21:57) or emotionally m to affirm someone's gender idty so then they ought not do it if it does them harm right my Principle
(22:03) as someone who believes in Liberal democracy is that we should structure our society in a way that people can be
(22:10) free to be who they are and that we should incentivize people to be respectful of other people's
(22:15) perspectives I don't want you foisting your religion on me I have no problem with you practicing your religion I have
(22:21) no problem with people benefiting from Christ's Consciousness I've personally seen people turn their lives around
(22:28) because they found Christ I went through an EDG Lord atheist phase when I was younger and I would have said different
(22:33) things I would have been outwardly hostile towards people hit that like button complete shift of heart I don't want you to not feel comfortable in this
(22:39) country for the same reason I don't want somebody's trans to not feel comfortable in their Community this has nothing to
(22:44) do with what I'm saying I don't care about your emotional state I want a direct answer to my question right if it
(22:50) makes a person feel if it makes a person if they think they're lying by affirming
(22:57) this they still affirm it in my opinion yes yes so you want
(23:05) people who who think that they're lying to lie anyway to make this other
(23:11) subset feel better however if the roles were reversed you would not allow that the racist is think from his perspective
(23:18) is also telling the truth and would be lying by not doing X and yet in that case you would say no what is the
(23:24) distinction here if un living in principle is equal to both groups are you telling me that the the
(23:33) act of asking or or in some cases requiring a Christian to affirm someone's chosen expressed identity
(23:40) would be analogous to the harm that uh trans people experience as a result of
(23:45) the social stigma that exists still to this day there's a great reframing wait wait wait no no no hold
(23:51) on compar you made the comparison I didn't I gave you I literally am am trying to show you where your logic
(23:58) entail you didn't question you didn't answer the question you're you're redirecting the conversation to be one
(24:04) about the harm that a Christian person would experience personally from ident from uh affirming a trans person's
(24:10) identity I'm asking you are we seeing like similar suicide rates for Christian people that have to force these sorts of
(24:16) things has any Christian ever had the thought that they wanted to un alive
(24:21) themselves because they are being asked to affirm a trans person's identity tell me something sir which racial group has
(24:28) the highest unal living rate inside of the United States I don't know the answer to that
(24:33) question I would if you had to guess I would assume white people and which demographic is the most highly religious
(24:40) inside of the United United States when it comes to Christianity uh is it black communities
(24:47) no is it white communities well it might be Hispanic now but you see very hang on
(24:54) stop stop stop stop stop bro but just like how Hispanics are often categorized
(25:00) as white which they are on uh much of the census information okay sure yes
(25:07) that particular demographic well whereas the black demographic has almost the lowest suicide rate just so you know the
(25:13) lowest unal living rate these rates obviously do feel that they are oppressed and that they are being
(25:20) oppressed or that there's some sort of social stigma against them because when you uh dive into why it is that they're
(25:26) unal living themselves they seem to uh either talk about the stigma that's against them in the court system inside
(25:33) of society things like this so my question becomes this ultimately if Christians feel like
(25:40) they're lying they're lying by affirming this you say they still ought to because
(25:47) you feel like the harm that it does is such that that uh they should lie anyhow to make this other subset feel better
(25:54) however if we reverse the roles again and we were to take uh whites who were
(26:00) you know doing this towards blacks you say in that particular instance what
(26:05) that they ought to or ought not to they ought to or ought not to use
(26:11) slurs in my opinion they ought not to because the harm principle right yes yes
(26:16) right okay now let's let's reverse the roles again let us assume for a second
(26:22) that it was black people using these slurs overwhelmingly towards white people do you think that those people
(26:28) are doing a greater amount of harm and that they should be allowed to do that they ought to be able to do that I I don't know how to quantify that kind of
(26:34) harm I think it's wrong to use slurs against somebody uh for being a part of some
(26:41) group whether that be sexual preference or gender identity or race or religion I
(26:46) don't I generally broadly speaking don't think that using slurs is a good thing
(26:51) because if you sir if you don't know how to quantify it then why in the world would you make the a claim that it
(26:57) should or shouldn't be done in the first
(27:02) place yeah can can you can you try to reframe this in a way because what you're saying makes no sense to me oh
(27:09) yeah it doesn't huh well let me yeah like once again guys I'd be adjusting my camera as well if I was him um it's
(27:15) pretty much an indefensible position that he's got because his whole metric is harm it's these people want to unive
(27:21) themselves and it hurts their feelings and it makes them feel bad so what that is it's these this small subset of the
(27:27) population holding a gun to their own heads and saying if you guys don't affirm me I'll do it I'll do it you have
(27:33) to lie but actually that harms us because we don't want to lie and we don't want to live in a society where we
(27:38) have to lie we don't want to live in a society where we obate the truth to appease people's feelings because we
(27:44) know what kind of a slippery slope that is so if and this is It's essentially an
(27:50) indefensible argument once you just present this particular argument which is that we have to lie and that hurts
(27:55) our feelings so I mean whose harm is great and they can't answer that it just comes down to my preference they're not
(28:01) appealing to anything else that's actually objective it's an arbitrary standard and we can both and we can use
(28:06) that exact same logic let's watch him adjust his camera again well let me let me help you out just quickly though guys
(28:12) we'll just read out this one we got Ryan in the chat has been a big Dono appreciate that Ryan starting my day
(28:17) armed and dangerous thanks for all the memberships as well the other day Ryan appreciate that if you guys want to become a channel member it's just a fine
(28:23) time to do it based on the Bas util [ __ ] it's doing
(28:29) this based on you C do you curse on YouTube by the way yeah that's fine based on the YouTube or based on the
(28:36) utils of harm you just got done telling me that you could not actually quantify this kind of harm And yet when I say
(28:42) nobody can right but yet when I ask you if that's the case and Christians are feeling harmed by this should they lie
(28:49) anyway and take the harm for the other subset you say yes so if you can't quantify it why in the [ __ ] world
(28:55) would you say that they ought to do it how could I possibly Quantified I'm why are you making an A on something you
(29:01) can't quantify lunatic you don't need to quantify the broad concept that using
(29:06) slurs could do harm to somebody else's well-being why do I need to give you a specific because what about the
(29:12) quantification of the fact that if a person it feels like they're lying that
(29:17) obviously does them harm you agree that it does them harm you just say we can't quantify who's being more harmed but they ought not do it anyway that's
(29:24) Insanity to me I'm not begging you to affirm people's identity that's the difference I'm not going to sit here and
(29:30) beg you to do that I think in most cases that's a waste of time you believe it's morally wrong speaking for for my for my
(29:37) moral how could it be morally wrong for you if you can't quantify it I'm not making the case that I'm trying to
(29:42) change your mind I have no I have no sense that I could do that in the first place this is just something that I
(29:48) think generally speaking people should do you're trying to compare why you can't quantify it you brought up you
(29:55) brought up suicide should they do it you brought up unal living rates with certain groups you surely you must
(30:02) understand that the group that has the highest unal living rates in in the world are trans people so you can't so
(30:08) wait so you can quantify let me just ask you let me just ask you as a Christian when you hear of large numbers of one
(30:14) group that want to take the DraStic measure of ending their life which to me is a to incoming does that do any does
(30:21) it stir anything in you does it make you sad does make you sad does it make you sad yeah I would prefer of course to not
(30:28) see people unal living themselves okay great we found Common Ground now now that I've answered your question can you
(30:33) answer mine again you you you refused to I I just gave you a direct yes no answer
(30:40) very direct very concise so let's try this on your end too okay if you just
(30:46) once again just the hypocrisy because what he's saying is look at all of these people over here that are suffering
(30:51) doesn't that make you sad and if it makes you sad you have to agree with me because it makes me sad as well so then
(30:56) we have to just affirm what they what they uh what they want but if we say hold on a second if I have to lie all
(31:03) the time it makes me sad doesn't it make you sad that I'm sad and shouldn't we all be sad and shouldn't we all be
(31:08) affirming the fact that I don't shouldn't have to lie actually we don't care about that we only care if they're sad you cannot quantify the harm done by
(31:16) either group why would you make the a why I'm saying I can't get into granular
(31:22) specific detail and tell you okay this harms people 97% or this harms people
(31:28) 68% I'm talking about broad Concepts I don't know why you're getting hung up on
(31:33) trying to assign what like a specific number or percent because inside because here's how your brain works your brain
(31:40) assigns a harm Doctrine thing harmful thing bad yes in many cases yes thing harmful
(31:49) thing harmful thing bad so if it is the case that thing harmful thing bad then
(31:54) we would need a way to determine which thing's the most harmful to be the most bad and then we ought not do that thing
(32:00) in this particular case I ask you great we have this thing you say we ought not do and you say but we can't quantify it
(32:06) so then I ask why ought we not do it and you go I don't [ __ ] know what what I can tell you is that
(32:11) are you you're a you must be aware that trans people are at the highest risk of any group of unal unal living themselves
(32:20) right of any group of unal living themselves you mean like per capita
(32:26) literally yes yeah that could be true it's it's anywhere I I've seen many
(32:32) numbers that go up to at least 15 50% of people have either attempted it or or actually tried to go through with it I'm
(32:39) asking you as a Christian would you be interested in taking steps that maybe if it makes you feel uncomfortable might
(32:45) bring those numbers down yes that's why I would advocate for some kind of social stigma towards the behavior is there any
(32:53) evidence that pursuing a policy of social stigma is going to reduce the
(32:58) rates of so glad that you asked that question let's go let's go back if you don't mind
(33:07) to the 40s 50s 60s 7s and 80s can you tell me do you think that do
(33:15) you think that the level of teenage unal living was higher or lower I don't know you tell me what if
(33:22) you had to guess uh I assume you're you're going to say that went higher so I'm going to yes
(33:28) with that no they were lower sorry that's what I meant now if
(33:33) that's the case if it is the case that in the 50s and the 60s that this the unal living rate of these kids was much
(33:41) lower than it is now and it is your position that there must
(33:47) talk yeah trans people yeah if it's your position that there must have been just as many trans people alive then as there
(33:53) is now per capita right and this is how you would account for the rapid uptick
(34:00) uh due to the lack of stigma then can you explain why they weren't unal living themselves then even though there was no
(34:06) doubt that the stigma was a hundred times higher than it is now I I have no
(34:11) idea how reliable your data is when we're going back to the 1940s when being
(34:17) an open out trans person was way less common for obvious reasons so shouldn't
(34:23) we so wouldn't you expect to see the uning rate of those people had such a stigma against to be much higher I'm
(34:29) saying I'm questioning your data because I don't know how we could reliably answer my question wouldn't would you
(34:34) expect to see it higher data because I don't know how anybody could reliably go
(34:40) back to the 1940s and then speak definitively on unal living rates for Trans
(34:46) people I didn't ask about different I didn't ask about the uning rates stop I
(34:52) didn't ask about uning R for Trans people like listen if like look you're just you're straw maning the position
(34:57) would like I would like to have a conversation with you where where I allow you to say the
(35:03) things that you want to say and just let me speak okay you know how we can do that the easiest way possible here's the easiest stop that's true but here's how
(35:12) okay he's triggered now he is triggered all right guys Ryan has thrown down the
(35:18) gauntlet here and he said he'll match anybody's gift me membership gifts
(35:24) appreciate that randomly epic has also gifted five
(35:29) Devin the Dude has gifted five Ryan's gifted 10 they're flowing in guys you
(35:34) guys get access to all of those emojis and everything Vinnie's made a bunch of emojis for the uh memberships so I
(35:41) appreciate that appreciate Ryan throwing down the gauntlet randomly epic for 10
(35:46) bucks says be nice or they'll un alive themselves is a stupid argument it's like telling somebody you'll un alive yourself if they leave you it's
(35:51) emotional blackmail it's exactly what it is it's emotional blackmail and we don't have to stand for it every anytime you hear this argument it's like oh you
(35:57) don't care you're you're not sensitive towards these people yeah like I we just don't deal in emotional blackmail and if
(36:04) you have to obvious skate the truth in order to appease somebody else to say or else I'll do it we don't have to put up
(36:09) with that [ __ ] so don't ever put up with it anyways here's how I can stop cutting you off every time you have this choose
(36:16) not no I'm gonna tell you you have this obnoxious habit and what you do is this and it's a very low low tier debate
(36:23) habit from low tier Debaters you'll give them a position or you'll give them a standard you give them something like
(36:29) that they'll stop they'll reframe they'll strawman the position make an argument and then I have to go right
(36:34) back and clarify it so I hang a stop stop I'm almost done I promise it'll get way more respectful after this it it'll
(36:40) have to you'll see if instead you actually just argue the position without
(36:45) reframing it without straw Manning it without any of that I'll never have to cut you off he can't do that what what
(36:52) what position specifically did I straw man you on well so in this case I asked specifically about teenage unal living
(36:59) rates you brought up I don't know how we could track trans this and trans that answer to the teenage unal living rates
(37:06) first before you jump ahead to something I didn't actually state to be fair I
(37:12) thought you were talking about teenage trans people which is why I cut you off confusion why I cut you off if you if
(37:19) you want to talk about higher rates of teenage people unal living themselves we're talking about an incredibly
(37:25) complex issue oh so many different variables to consider not least of which
(37:31) the [ __ ] internet and social media which is making everybody less happy so I don't know what you're ascribing this
(37:37) Higher unal Living rate to it seems like you want to point to what you would call degeneracy so homosexuality or transness
(37:44) I don't know how you could leave to that conclusion when there are about 10,000 variables you would necessar let's start
(37:49) with the variable of the internet you realized that the internet is a recent convention and that these unal living
(37:55) rates were increasing before it ever existed sure I'll take you out your word for
(38:00) that but then so we can take that off of the table right wait wait wait wait would you would you would you seriously
(38:06) dispute that the internet is contributing to higher levels of
(38:12) depression uh yeah in some cases it is yeah okay so then we don't take it off the
(38:17) table it doesn't matter if something was trending in One Direction something can come along and contribute to that we can
(38:24) control strike it realize a trend yeah but we can control variables my point on
(38:30) YouTube Tak how are we going to control for these because if if the trend was already up before there was an internet
(38:35) then we're controlling for the internet variable and saying well we can take that off the table the trend was still going up so what are the other variables
(38:42) then I mean where do you even want to begin when we're talking about variables the fact that
(38:48) there on the decline then sure we can do that or we can talk about social stigma let's try it this way we'll try it a
(38:54) different direction do you think that there was more or less social stigma around divorce in the 1940s and 50s than
(39:00) there is now OB obviously more obviously more and do you see the trend of divorce going up or down as stigma against it
(39:06) has decreased uh I'm not sure if it's flatlined around 50% but it certainly went up since then and since stigma has
(39:12) been going down since a sexual Revolution which way did it go up or down which way did what go now divorce
(39:18) rates I would I would assume it went up you would assume it went up because the stigma went down Lally follows logically
(39:24) follows logically follows right so that's what you would expect to see so shouldn't we see the exact same Trend
(39:30) with lgbtq people uh uh so uh sorry let me just
(39:37) repeat back back what you're saying to me you're saying that because there's less stigma now around lgbtq stuff but
(39:43) the suicide now he's going into the liberal Nuance again guys he's been caught in another logic trap here
(39:49) because he's saying if the stigma goes up the rate of it goes down more stigma
(39:55) means less of it so he's saying the stigma goes up for divorce more stigma
(40:00) for divorce less divorce he says yeah it logically follows and he goes okay well
(40:07) in terms of the trans stuff we increase the stigma of this unnatural Behavior we get less of it which means we get the
(40:13) less of the uning that you hate so much can we can we can
(40:20) we not good not good to be a liberality is higher that's very strange to me well
(40:27) I don't know if you could pin it entirely on one thing or another and I don't know if you can understate the
(40:33) importance of of a phenomenon of a of a a human uh advancement like the internet
(40:40) it just throws kerosene on everything so I I'm not I don't want why we just controlled we just controlled for the
(40:46) internet if we took the internet off the table we'd still say the see the same rates guys just need to remind you 2,400
(40:54) all up across platforms The Crucible has pages and pages and pages and pages
(41:00) of these debates of Andrew just absolutely ring into these liberals and they're letting us use the uh the paid
(41:05) paid membership content today so if you guys haven't checked it out and if you want to go in there and just analyze these debates and just watch How to
(41:11) absolutely destroy every single liberal argument then that's the place to go that's linked below appreciate them
(41:17) letting us use it to be a stigma both ways you you're you're making the case to me and it feels just Prima fasy Just
(41:25) absurd that if we increased stigma levels towards like queerness in this country that unal
(41:32) living rates would go down yeah you're you're trying to make the case that this is a thing be by going back to 1940 and
(41:40) but but wholly ignoring any number of other variables that we would consider which is why when you bring up each
(41:46) individual variable I'm willing to engage with all of them like I did your major one the Internet by showing you
(41:51) the stigmatization still increased regardless of the internet being here or not sure sure I mean I think like I
(41:58) think that there are a ton of reasons why a lot of people are feeling a a sense of apathy a sense of Malay or it
(42:06) might even escalate to the point of depression people are feeling more isolated this is a sentiment that we're
(42:11) hear hearing from people all over the world religion is on the decline that served a useful social utilitarian
(42:18) purpose for centuries still does uh it's sure and it still does when we're
(42:23) talking about things like far more than secularism secularism offers us nothing well I mean it offers you nothing it
(42:30) offers you nothing what does it offer you so secular I can't get this [ __ ]
(42:35) camera to secularism can't even fix your camera for you no bro that's God that's God messing with you bro
(42:43) true 2000 in the Jack why don't you take a minute take a
(42:49) minute collect your thoughts get your camera situated I'll still be here I just can't get this [ __ ]
(42:54) camera to say all you you might have to see the top of
(43:00) my head here system can exist in a secular structure yeah I know but what if I wait
(43:07) a second wait a second I don't think it's let me just real real quick what
(43:13) happened religion or another is going to be able to successfully convert
(43:18) everybody around them it just doesn't work that way there's no historical precedent to suggest that that's a sust
(43:24) sustainable system what's a sustainable system you cut out for a second this
(43:30) idea that you should force through legislation or extreme coersion or
(43:35) violence force people to adopt your religious framework I favor a system
(43:41) where many religions can flourish and communities can now guys if you watched my breakdown the other day I did about a
(43:48) 20-minute segment and we're about to get into that segment and this is where like this is one of the most brutal logic
(43:53) traps that he gets caught in throughout this whole entire debate and he gets caught in many of them because what he's saying right now is I favor this liberal
(44:01) democracy this this secular system where everybody can just do what they want all the time and everybody's religions can
(44:07) just flourish and just watch how this unfolds it's absolutely poetic benefit because of this flourishment and and secular uh
(44:14) democracy can do that well then let us go back to the roots of secular
(44:21) democracy was the secular democracy which you just appealed to in the United States brought to you by SEC or was it
(44:27) brought to you by Christians if you're talking about the founding fathers many of them obviously
(44:33) believed in uh the the Christian God and it was a
(44:39) spectrum probably all of them but there was a spectrum of belief at that time you had people that practiced these
(44:44) Orthodox versions of their religion and then and then you had a spectrum go all the way to deism which at the time was
(44:50) emerging as this way more popular philosophy it was taught to the intellectuals at that time it was it was
(44:56) booming in popularity and so when we talk about like Thomas Jefferson George Washington Benjamin Franklin these
(45:02) people believed in sort of an absentee landlord version of God so even if they practice Believe Christian yes problem
(45:10) if people I don't know why you're saying that's because you said that secularist brought this to us doesn't sound like secularist brought it to us you can have
(45:16) religion in a secular system a secular system but that wasn't your claim your claim was that secularist brought us
(45:23) this system I I don't think I ever said you did in fact Let me let me I can tell you
(45:29) right back what you did say you keep on freezing bro I don't know what's going on you asked me what secularism does for
(45:35) me I never told you that atheist or I'm yeah I never told you that atheists gave us secularism okay
(45:42) gonna ago no no no that wasn't a straw man you said the reason you said the reason you Embrace secularism is because
(45:48) it allows for enlightenment egalitarian values very strange because it was not
(45:54) secularists who brought enlightenment egal Arian value sir what does that matter well it matters because you're
(46:01) kind of trying to make the Bold claim that Christianity itself is adversarial
(46:07) to these values now it should be adversarial but the Protestants here have not ever been traditionally
(46:12) adversarial they were the ones who brought it your version of Christianity a Theocratic State uh something when if
(46:20) I ever asked for Theocratic State maybe I misinterpret it if you could tell me what your ideal form of governance would
(46:26) look like like in relation to your religion if you want to clarify them I'm all years yeah it would be a synergistic
(46:31) relationship between the church and the state like for instance are you aware that in England they have a church of
(46:40) England yes okay are you aware that at our founding that all of our colonies
(46:45) all of them post founding still had a state religion yes okay great do you
(46:50) know why that was the case explain it's because secularists have no moral Authority or autonomy they
(46:58) have a do as thou Wilt harm principle so they can't really make a claims they don't make any sense you say that
(47:04) secularist should be in charge I say secularist should not be in charge because they have no moral or ethical
(47:10) epistemological Foundation to make a claims on anybody to do anything at any time ever they have a bizarre Live and
(47:17) Let Live policy which is really bad for governing a nation I did not say that secularists
(47:24) necessarily need to be in charge I have no problem if a Christian is elected
(47:29) president of the United States even though I don't practice Christianity as long as he does so long so long as they
(47:37) uh serve the country in a way that lines up with my ideal version of government
(47:42) secular values it could be it could be a Muslim it could be a Christian as long
(47:48) as he rules as a secularist you don't care sure yes now tell me what's actually immoral
(47:57) yes yeah now tell me what's actually immoral about the religious ruling from a religious prism and enacting law based
(48:05) around their religious values and not taking secularists into consideration at all I'm not making I'm not making moral
(48:12) judgments about like what you would prefer if you live in a Christian town and you guys democratically decide to
(48:19) pursue policies that line up with your CHR democratically do it fine that's
(48:25) what's wrong if they don't want to democratically do it what if they authoritarian do it what's what's your actual moral claim against that even
(48:32) because my preference is your preference so your moral claim is your preference what this conversation is about I
(48:38) thought this was going to be a conversation about what system you prefer versus what system I prefer and
(48:45) inside of a system of preferences there should be some type of a or justification for it outside of good I
(48:51) want that I just want that you're your moral imperative is my
(48:56) preferences who is straw man and who now I didn't say that SEC you said you want it because of your preferences that's it
(49:02) I did not say I did not say that I prefer secularism simply because I prefer it I can give you reasons why I
(49:09) prefer secularism and I outside of your preferences let's do it I told you that my preference is a system that allows
(49:15) for mple types of multiple types of people and when I look at America as a
(49:22) as a as a democratic experiment I see success all over the country it's not a perfect country we could do better but I
(49:28) see Su success all over the country I think this is a really good system that we have here this is a system that
(49:34) allows for people like you and me to exist and have the same uh I need you to
(49:40) I need you to note this and you can you can go back right this second you can rewind your own tape and you can see it
(49:45) for yourself you said in the span of 20 seconds I did not say that my
(49:52) preferences are the thing which I am appealing to for it is that I want this
(49:58) form of government and then went on to say but my preference is this form of government so are you appealing to
(50:03) anything external to your own stop are you appealing to anything external to your own preferences or aren't you no I
(50:11) would appeal to social utility and my idea of what would be uh good in service
(50:16) of that goal my was pushing back against your take that I want secularism simply
(50:22) because I want why ought we follow social utility reason we ought F we ought follow social
(50:29) utility because I believe in pursuing a system because of your preferences he's making an ought claim here guys and like
(50:36) Andrew said before under his secular worldview he can't make an ought claim because when you're making an ought
(50:41) claim you need to have a moral justification for that and if your moral justification is my preferences as he
(50:46) keeps saying then that's that's just a completely arbitrary justification you don't have anything external that you're
(50:52) actually appealing to and he's just said that you we ought to do X we ought to
(50:58) govern according to my secular worldview couple of super chats here Dustin hefa super sticker for five bucks appreciate
(51:04) that Ryan says thanks Dustin I'll match the super chats Ryan is killing it today Jonathan dian's in the chat says had one
(51:12) liberal told me her subjective morality was objectively grounded in the gods
(51:17) that revealed themselves to her we do get a few of these sort of crystals out there Jonathan's another one who's
(51:22) regularly in the Tik Tok invasions on The Crucible we have way too much fun way too much fun all right let's carry
(51:28) on guys let's carry on with his ought claims according to hisma preferences preferences I believe that would be in
(51:34) my opinion the best uh outcome for individuals that exist within that system so that's your preferences I try
(51:40) to I try to maximize good outcomes according to what I believe as I assume
(51:46) you do those are all your preferences bro what what what are the differences between you and me you have a preference
(51:52) I have Epic no no I have epistemic justification for knowledge you do not
(51:57) have epistemic justification for knowledge you can't justify how you even know a thing let alone why we should
(52:03) govern with that thing so as we move in to your preferences my preferences it's
(52:09) your preference that we follow your preference that's your preference right but it's my preference that we don't
(52:15) follow your preference and that's my preference great that's that's what you
(52:20) want of this that's all right guys just for those of you who didn't watch the video the other day and who haven't really dove into this as much so when it
(52:27) comes to epistemic justification epistemology is the field of philosophy that's concerned with knowledge so what
(52:34) is knowledge how do we know things and and how do we justify what it is that we know and uh Andrew has his
(52:42) epistemological justification but this guy doesn't have any whatsoever and his his justification right now is because
(52:48) of my feelings basically because I feel like that's what we should do and it's really funny to watch to watch this
(52:54) unfold so then how do we make the determination as to who is right we would get into the minutia of why we
(53:00) think our systems are better than the other person's system because if our preferences for exactly well if it's
(53:07) just because of our if there's no justification outside of what is preferable to the individual it's my
(53:12) preference that I rule everybody what's wrong with that that is your opinion I disagree
(53:19) well wait wait a second you can't disagree my preferences are just as
(53:24) valid as yours I'm not disagreeing that you have a preference yeah but what
(53:29) makes it less valid than yours best outcome for the people that live within the system what makes my preference less
(53:36) less good than your preference when we're talking about something like affirming identities we're talking about
(53:44) unal living rates we're talking about this thing called social stigma what makes my preference less viable than
(53:50) your PR trying to give you an example so in this specific case that is an outcome
(53:55) that I don't like I don't like seeing people un alive themselves prer or
(54:01) experience something like deep depression because of social stigma don't you understand how how ridiculous
(54:08) this is every time I ask you why should we appeal to your preferences instead of
(54:14) mine for moral ODS you say because it's my preference that you do so every single time I believe is saying my
(54:19) preference everything is my preference my preference my preference do you have anything that you can justify this on
(54:24) outside of you should moral ODS come from Hut's brain and his preferences
(54:30) brother the justification that I'm giving you are things that exist outside of my experience I'm not talking about
(54:36) my individual experience in this system I'm talking about a system that most benefits everyone and is it why should
(54:44) we follow a system that benefits everyone because we all want good
(54:51) outcomes in accordance with in accordance with our philosophical underpinnings
(54:57) preferences yes yeah so then you're appealing to nothing more than your individual preferences all of the
(55:03) world's morality and everything in it comes from Hutch's brain and his
(55:08) preferences so uh if you guys haven't uh watched a lot of these debates when it
(55:14) comes to the idea of and I I don't think I could maybe in 10 years time I could debate this particular topic it's a it's
(55:20) a difficult one but this is such a brutal hole to be in for this guy hch because if he wants to play with the big
(55:26) boys and and have this this debate about morality then he's got to be really sharp with this because even the
(55:32) sharpest of the sharp when it comes to the atheist Debaters uh about about morality and probably guys like Sam
(55:38) Harris who wrote the moral landscape still get absolutely wiped when it comes to this topic um if you look at Sam
(55:45) Harris debating William Lane Craig the long debate that they had he gets killed in that debate he gets absolutely
(55:51) dragged in that debate and it's it's really not something it's it's not an easy one for the atheists to debate
(55:57) there are some who are who are good at it don't get me wrong but if you want to have this debate with a Christian and somebody who's who's who's got a
(56:03) grounded sort of moral worldview and can ground their worldview then it's going to be a very difficult one and this is
(56:09) why he's just getting beaten from Pillar To Post here that's what's moral and immoral then give me a moral
(56:16) justification external your preferences and why we should follow them I I I
(56:21) believe that all moral all morality is subjective we don't derive it from or I
(56:27) don't derive it from scripture I derive it from my experience as a human being
(56:32) and my My Philosophy the one thing that I try to lead with is empathy that's it
(56:38) and this is something that I I was taught when it came to scripture when we when we learned about Jesus's teaching
(56:43) the two main rules that he gave was love the God your father and love your neighbor so there's even though I don't
(56:49) subscribe to Christianity at this point in my life I still gleaned valuable
(56:54) lessons from the teachings of carry those teachings but that's all subjective preference right yes so if
(57:01) it's all subjective preference and you can appeal to nothing outside of your own preference Hutch's preference is the
(57:08) way the world ought to be because that's how he prefers it to be then Andrew Wilson wants the world to be this way
(57:15) because I prefer it that way can you tell me why I'm wrong no I don't think you're wrong everybody has their own
(57:22) subjective take on what morality is so my preference then is just morality from scripture sure it's valid
(57:29) I'm not going to tell you it's in if my preference is just as valid as yours then you how can you not agree you just
(57:35) said it's just as valid as yours what what's there to disagree with what what what what can I not agree with how can
(57:41) you disagree if my preferences if my preferences are just as valuable as yours how in the [ __ ] could you disagree
(57:48) with them so this is this is really brutal and Andrew is about to use some
(57:53) some good examples here but if this is your worldview that your preferences are just as valuable as my preferences and
(57:59) that everything is always just subjective then there there's some really great examples that you can use
(58:04) that Andrew is about to use the examples of the Aztecs you can use the Papa New Guinea tribe that take the little boys
(58:09) away from their mothers from an early age and they you know assault them and uh we can't really say that on YouTube
(58:16) but if your preference is just as valid as those one that because that's what you're saying that your preference is
(58:22) just as valid as those guys who do those horrendous things to little boys but if
(58:27) you say actually no theirs is objectively worse than mine then you have to give a justification for that
(58:33) you have to give a moral justification for why that is worse and when you try and do that then you're insinuating that
(58:39) there's some sort of at least a gradation to morality there some things are worse than other things and that
(58:45) would imply a moral hierarchy and so he's he's in a literal trap here it's quite funny to
(58:51) watch he he can't say that anything is worse than anything else that's why he couldn't say that his preference of not
(58:57) being racist is better than someone's preference of being racist all the time
(59:02) this is brutal when we're talking about this sort of thing what what I'm telling you is that I don't doubt that you
(59:09) quickly read a few super chats here guys appreciate the support today Ryan for five bucks says if you
(59:14) just joined the show I'm matching super chats and membership gifts really appreciate that Ryan uh Jonathan said for five bucks
(59:22) this is the art Hume the the art uh Hume dilemma always wrecks these Le toids funny how David hum was basically the
(59:29) Godfather of modern skeptic athe atheism exactly right Ryan Slater says great
(59:34) comment Jonathan I'm reading this backwards Ryan Slater also said what's up Annie thanks
(59:40) for the love to Annie who said let's go Ryan sending love from England great to see the British in the chat today
(59:49) guys all righty you believe that your moral system is correct so in that sense it's
(59:58) valid no you're saying my moral system is correct I'm no not Accord not according
(1:00:04) to my I'm sorry that's so weird I thought your preference was that all preferences are equal therefore all
(1:00:10) moral systems are correct and equal no I'm saying everybody has their own experience with these sorts of things
(1:00:17) wait what hang on I'm sorry are my preference is valid or not it's they're valid in the sense that if you tell me
(1:00:24) that this is what you believe I'm going to believe that doesn't necessarily that doesn't necessarily mean that I agree
(1:00:31) with what you are uh proposing in terms of so then my so then my preferences
(1:00:37) would be not as valid as yours right no I'm not saying that no
(1:00:45) everybody has their own perspective it is not up to me to tell you or anybody else that it is invalid you understand
(1:00:52) that no I don't listen it that actually makes no sense here you want to you want to live in a world where you can just
(1:00:58) tell me that this or this thing thing is invalid and you'll probably let of thing
(1:01:03) let me help you out with this so that you understand there's Aztecs who are cutting out a man's heart on top of a
(1:01:09) pyramid and they're going to kick his corpse down the steps based on their preferences sure are what they doing is
(1:01:15) what they are doing immoral according to me according to you
(1:01:22) and your let's just walk through it so I can show you this that you understand
(1:01:27) according to your preferences right uh preferences is like one word to but sure
(1:01:33) yeah we can use that word so if it's immoral that they're doing this according to your preference they ought
(1:01:39) not do it according to what you prefer right they ought not do it because I don't think that uh snuffing out
(1:01:45) somebody's life before it's their time to die is is a good thing human beings
(1:01:51) My Philosophy your preference is that no My Philosophy is that to be human being
(1:01:57) on this planet is to be given uh a tremendous gift to witness what we can
(1:02:03) witness here and because of that I want everybody to experience the same thing
(1:02:08) that I've experienced when I go to like yose for example and you can't do that if you sacrifice someone on an altar
(1:02:15) because it's an eclipse or something is that because you see this is the sort of
(1:02:21) uh Urban liberal mindset right here it's I want everybody to be able to witness the beauty that I saw when I went to to
(1:02:27) yosity I want everybody to be able to have the Wi-Fi that I've got fast Wi-Fi 300 megabits I want everyone to be able
(1:02:33) to stream like I stream I want everybody to be able to flush the toilet and just just goes away this is the the modern
(1:02:40) liberal Urban mindset when they don't realize that throughout human history people have been engaged in toil and
(1:02:46) suffering and life hasn't always been easy you haven't always been able to go to holidays to Y and go and visit the
(1:02:51) the beautiful landscapes we actually have to contend with suffering slavery has been a staple of of of the human
(1:02:59) experience throughout history early death uh High rates of child morbidity I
(1:03:04) mean people around the world are still vastly vastly more impoverished than
(1:03:11) they are rich there are a lot more people suffering and starving than there are people going on holidays to Yos but
(1:03:18) these liberals they sort of they look at their prism their worldview be like look at me look at me going on my holiday and
(1:03:23) having my fast Wi-Fi I want everybody to be able to have this but it doesn't really work out because actually in in
(1:03:30) in reality people have to contend with suffering anyways and how do we do that
(1:03:35) keep we'll keep going because you would prefer that they don't sure yes can you appeal to
(1:03:41) anything outside of your preference no not really so then great so then if they justify and say this is
(1:03:48) our preference and we appeal to nothing outside of our own preference how could they possibly be wrong
(1:03:56) they're wrong according to me yeah but you're wrong okay I get it but that doesn't actually make sense because
(1:04:02) unless you're saying that your preferences are the ultimate Arbiter of all morality then their preferences have
(1:04:08) to be just as valid as your own sir when we use words like
(1:04:16) valid we use words like valid telling you that I think it's the correct thing
(1:04:23) to do so if I say your experience with morality is valid that's not the same thing as me saying I think that would be
(1:04:29) best for my community the country that I live in the state that I live in ETC is
(1:04:35) that a subjective preference is what a subject subjective
(1:04:41) preference that when you say x that means
(1:04:47) y can you relate that back to what I just said yeah we'll relate it back to what you just said try to understand
(1:04:53) this if you make the clim that your preferences the ones that you want to
(1:04:59) see all ODS derive from all ODS derive from your preferences that would mean
(1:05:05) you would be the ultimate Authority and arbiter of what is moral and immoral if you are to say that somebody
(1:05:13) stop stop let me finish if you are to say somebody else's preferences are just as valid as yours that would be saying
(1:05:20) that they also are the ultimate Arbiters of what is moral so either one of you are wrong or both of you are wrong so I
(1:05:28) think where we're missing each other is I don't pretend to be the Arbiter of
(1:05:33) morality the ultimate Arbiter of morality in this country in my city in
(1:05:39) the world I don't com that everybody follow what I believe in I am not trying
(1:05:45) to voice that on everybody around me you seem to think don't understand that has
(1:05:50) nothing to do with what I just said let's assume for a second said a moment ago you just called me the ultimate
(1:05:56) orbit this is just a logical extension of your positions what I'm trying to show you regardless of if you don't
(1:06:02) don't want to be the ultimate Orbiter or you do want to be the ultimate arbit guys just quickly we've got a lot of new
(1:06:07) members in the chat today I want to see the beta based the cry and the cringe emojis Vinnie's made all these emojis
(1:06:13) for us to use whenever this guy says something cringe I want to see cringe whenever he said well you just do the beta whenever because he's he's
(1:06:19) perpetually a beta male but let's see it you believe that all morality stems from your own preferences all these chats by
(1:06:26) the way guys everything everybody has their own subjective experience with morality and are yours better than
(1:06:32) theirs no they're they're not right then all morals are equal then I'm not saying
(1:06:38) that I'm not saying that I don't think that there are certain uh philosophies of morality that I don't consider mine
(1:06:45) to be better uh than I'm not saying that but I'm not say which better than yours but I necess but I I'm not saying that I
(1:06:52) necessarily believe that I'm right about everything or I should decide how a a
(1:06:58) society should uh conduct themselves morally what you're saying is that you
(1:07:04) have your preferences and everybody else has their preferences and there's no way to distinguish who's right so why are
(1:07:10) you on YouTube my friend debating this if everybody's preference is just as relevant as yours and you don't have a
(1:07:16) leg to stand on to tell people not to do something or not to have their preferences it doesn't make any sense go
(1:07:23) and do something else why are you debating on the internet oh okay got it
(1:07:28) so then you're not going to make any a claims ever again about how Society should conduct itself morally right no
(1:07:34) I'm going to tell you my preference and should we should anybody should anybody
(1:07:40) ever follow your preference should anybody ever follow it my preference would be for example that people respect
(1:07:47) someone's like preferred pronouns that's my PR got it should people follow any should people follow your preferences of
(1:07:54) course I would like to see that that but I don't delude
(1:08:01) myself have that like same level of comfort I can just simply tell you get I
(1:08:07) understand I understand your position follow your position that it is
(1:08:14) doing more harm to you odd people follow odd people follow your preferences or
(1:08:19) not I would like to see people in this world live a life that is answer
(1:08:26) question yes there's no it's not even a loaded question ought people follow your preferences or not that would be my
(1:08:33) preference yes so yes they should follow your preference right should they follow
(1:08:38) your preference above everybody else's that's a personal decision that everybody has that's not my question
(1:08:45) ought they follow you don't know if they should follow your preferences but you just said they should I reject your
(1:08:50) premise because my goal is not to proze my personal sense of morality to the
(1:08:56) world you just got done saying people ought to follow it what are you talking about but I don't go into it with the
(1:09:02) expectations that I can force that on everybody so everybody ought to follow your moral preferences except everybody
(1:09:09) who shouldn't my God bro I feel like we're getting very lost in the sauce when it we are because I keep on trying
(1:09:14) to explain this simple concept very different concepts to each other right now do you know why Rob no told you to
(1:09:20) to talk to me when it came to this stuff this is why because he knew that you're a dumbass and you need educated on this
(1:09:26) so that you understand I'm going to try to help you out this is why it's becoming a circle it's a lot of fun to do to you but you're caught in a logic
(1:09:33) trap and he can't get your way out I'm not going to let you out until you make the concession that you're the all that
(1:09:39) is good I would never say something that insane do you understand that the level
(1:09:44) of ego required to make such a claim is just astronomical I have no sense that I'm
(1:09:51) going to be able to like realistically change your mind or anybody else's mind I thought this would just make very an
(1:09:57) interesting conversation it has he literally just got done 15 minutes ago
(1:10:03) saying that he doesn't mind who governs as long as they govern according to his secular worldview how much ego is
(1:10:11) required to say a statement like that that people have to govern according to your secular
(1:10:17) worldview the hootspa on the man let's read some super chats Joe thig says for
(1:10:23) five bucks Hutch is a dishonest clown he tries to hide the ball and is definitely a closet socialist yeah for sure they
(1:10:28) all are bit like Scandinavian type socialist yeah he got cooked in the sitch and Adam show not long ago send me
(1:10:35) that Joe I want I want to watch that Ryan Slater matching it once again Jonathan Dyan is back in I'm not the
(1:10:41) ultimate Arbor of morality I will just claim that all morality is subjective but my preference of morality is better
(1:10:47) than yours exactly right it summarizes pretty much that whole section of the conversation and then Ryan matching it
(1:10:52) again appreciate you Ryan all right let's carry on guys because this is marks the end of the video that we
(1:10:58) covered the other day but it actually doesn't get any better for Hut from here on in he keeps on getting absolutely rolled around in the mud so let's just
(1:11:03) keep going it's made a great it's made for a great conversation went straight for the blood sports stuff like it's not
(1:11:09) blood Sports this is basic basic stuff you want to get into a you want to get into a theological debate with somebody
(1:11:16) who has epistemic justification and when they ask who the ultimate Arbiter of morality is you say you but also not you
(1:11:23) and to explain how you're saying that I'll explain how you're saying it I will literally explain it to you how you're
(1:11:29) saying that is this if you say my preferences are things everybody ought
(1:11:34) to follow which you just got done saying by the way I asked you that yes or no you said yes it would be my preference
(1:11:40) that they all did if I say to you then if I say to you then somebody else over here then has a different set of
(1:11:46) preferences that means they ought not follow those right you say no that's called a performative contradiction
(1:11:52) makes no [ __ ] sense either they should follow your preference or they should not follow your preferences which
(1:11:57) one is it it's called The Law of excluded middle either they must or they must not they ought or they ought not I
(1:12:04) think the difference between you and me when we talk about our preferred system
(1:12:09) you seem to take the position that you would like to whether that be through coercion or maybe State intervention or
(1:12:16) as you said a few moments ago stigma or I'm not sure what other incentives you would use but your ultimate goal is to
(1:12:24) convert as many people to your belief system is possible that and I'm it's a
(1:12:30) good point that he raised there I mean it's just a it's ba it's breaking a basic law of logic you got the law of
(1:12:36) excluded middle the uh law of non-contradiction the law of identity so if you have the law of excluded middle
(1:12:42) if you say something ought or it ought not you can't have all of this sort of liberal Nuance prattle in the middle you
(1:12:47) have to either say somebody ought do something or ought not do something so it's just a basic law of logic being
(1:12:52) broken I'm saying that is not my goal because not realistic I don't I don't go
(1:12:58) into this kind of conversation with the expectation that I'm going to change your mind I'm not out there on the
(1:13:03) streets trying to convince everybody hey my way is the right way why according to
(1:13:08) me I need more evidence than what I was given to believe in something like a
(1:13:16) Christan with Christ Consciousness or or how it's benefited your life I'm not
(1:13:21) going to tell you that that's a bad thing I'm not going to try to change your mind if that's working for you
(1:13:27) great that is the promise of secular liberal democracy we can all exist in
(1:13:33) the same country without it being necessary to completely convert everybody in the country should people
(1:13:39) follow secular liberal democracy I mean sure that would be my preference but I'm not gonna I'm not
(1:13:44) gonna spend waste my time trying to force everybody into that position relax
(1:13:50) I just let you go on your whole Spiel I didn't interrupt you once just answer a couple of questions should follow
(1:13:55) liberal democracy that would be my preference okay for everybody on planet
(1:14:00) Earth ultimately yeah I don't see that anytime so anybody who doesn't want this
(1:14:06) is a should claim remember you just said they should anybody who does not want to follow liberal democracy then is doing
(1:14:12) something that is wrong or immoral right it it might be less than ideal I would
(1:14:17) say it like that so wrong these things are not mutually
(1:14:23) exclusive if I if I say it's less than just grant you the language I'll just give you the language it doesn't matter
(1:14:29) there could be there could be what I would consider like wrong examples of Theocratic states there could be other
(1:14:35) examples less than ideal fine fine fine less than less than ideal we'll use liberal democracy everybody on planet or
(1:14:41) should follow liberal democracy or it's less than ideal less than ideal meaning bad at least according to my according
(1:14:48) to my preferences and is there anybody on planet Earth anybody anywhere who
(1:14:54) could ever Trump that preference that that's bad is it always going to be bad
(1:14:59) should they always follow that according to your preferences or not so if they have a preference against it they have
(1:15:05) to be wrong because they're doing something bad right when when you talk about these things you you talk about it
(1:15:11) in a very Absolut sense and I'm saying there are gradients it's a spectrum so I don't believe in like ultimate bad logic
(1:15:17) is not a spectrum logic has three rules do you know what they are no no you don't know the three rules of logic no
(1:15:23) no okay can not one rule not the law of excluded middle not the law of identity
(1:15:28) not the law of non-contradiction you don't know any of those no no no you don't know any of them so how in the
(1:15:35) world are you how in the world could you ever make a should that's that's bad guys if you're
(1:15:42) a debater on the internet and uh you don't know one law of logic I mean fair
(1:15:47) enough people who don't study this sort of stuff but if you're a debater on the internet somebody who who actually actively engages in these sorts of
(1:15:53) things you don't know a single law of logic that's bad should claim you don't even
(1:15:59) know the basic rules of logic I'm just trying to have a conversation let me ask you one more
(1:16:04) question this is how I have conversations with normal human beings this is how I have conversations with normal human beings you you would appeal
(1:16:11) to science then in empiricism of course okay great tell me what the scientific method is you uh
(1:16:19) develop a hypothesis and you test the hypothesis and there's a s scrutiny from
(1:16:25) other people this sort of a thing yes I'm waiting for you what's the scientific method finish it for me no no
(1:16:32) you finish it what it's you're appealing to it finish the method I'm a little hazy on it would you finish you don't
(1:16:38) you appeal to the scientific method you don't even [ __ ] know the scientific method when we talk about science we talk about things that we can establish
(1:16:44) as we can we talk about things that we look the big brain on Chad holy [ __ ] I
(1:16:50) appeal to science what's scientific method I don't know
(1:16:56) [Laughter] I just I just can't even believe this is happening I just can't even believe
(1:17:03) it I really can't even believe it how are you this dumb bro oh that's so
(1:17:09) brutal I'm Not Gonna Knock myself for forgetting something that I learned that you appeal to for everything you appeal
(1:17:15) to all of your domestic policy decisions okay guys it I'm telling you
(1:17:21) it doesn't get any better from here it just keep they it just keeps on keeping on this is the 4 hours that just keeps on
(1:17:27) giving it's kib Nam medov grounding and pounding somebody choking them out nearly unconscious letting them back to
(1:17:33) their feet all over again four hours absolutely it's like some sort of like MS13 gang initiation or something like
(1:17:39) that it's so brutal anyways let's read some super chats here the text says based on his his logic he has to be a
(1:17:46) full a full Anarchist the epitome of Anarchy because nobody can enforce anything on anyone else so if someone
(1:17:53) wrongs you it can't be wrong if they believe it so well I mean that is actually very true because you kind of
(1:17:58) have to be an anarchist because if you believe that you can't enforce morality and you can't enforce societal standards and everybody just has to segregate
(1:18:04) because if everybody has these vastly different beliefs and there's nothing that can can allow us to coexist then
(1:18:10) everybody has to segregate we have to have our own little communities so it's a good point Ryan
(1:18:16) Slater matching it says text V Tex the Tex vet thank you for the service
(1:18:21) brother good to see some vets in here guys Jonathan D 10 bucks says Tex vet
(1:18:26) grift from the VA with disability claim as well not sure what that means but thanks for the 10 bucks John Dano for 20
(1:18:33) bucks says Ryan won't Ryan won't match this he's scared is he
(1:18:38) scared Ryan matches the other one Jonathan he shouldn't have to haha he
(1:18:45) served he should get paid that simple LOL and he matches Dan's 20 bucks saying
(1:18:50) Dano you at Soul ha be radical for five bucks says the guy
(1:18:57) named Hutch drinking from a flower vase is a normal human being he does it does look like a bit of a flower vase people
(1:19:03) are commenting a lot on the vas it might be like a wine kff but we'll call it a flower vase because he's a because he's
(1:19:09) a liberal let's continue thank you for all the support in the super chats guys
(1:19:14) really appreciate it glad to see all these membership emojis I'm reading every single comment that comes in love seeing the membership emojis we took it
(1:19:20) only took us two years to activate memberships CU I was like what are we doing membership for like what value are people actually getting from being
(1:19:26) members do they get anything else but uh here we are we're doing it I felt a bit
(1:19:32) bad doing it but it appears as though you guys are happy to do it so I mean my guilt is is is allayed you appeal to
(1:19:39) everything for everything why are you assigning me this position bro I just asked you would you appeal to science
(1:19:46) and empiricism for your positions you said yes I ask you scientific method you don't know it not for literally
(1:19:51) everything okay what thing would you appeal to I wouldn't use science to determine whether or not I like the
(1:19:57) movie who would you appeal to myself and are and are you the ultimate Arbiter
(1:20:03) then of if the movie was good or bad no if you like the movie and I don't it's fine that's my position [ __ ] it's
(1:20:11) hilarious all right I'll back off with the philosophy bro thing I think I I feel like I've U I've messed you up
(1:20:17) pretty bad on that well well well we we'll go to whatever we'll go to whatever crazy normative [ __ ] that you
(1:20:22) want to talk about because this is just this is just [ __ ] I can't even believe it you
(1:20:28) don't know any of the rules of logic none of the laws of logic you don't know the scientific method you appeal to it via empiricism I I just I can't even
(1:20:35) fathom it here here here it's bad let's let's talk about uh let's talk about Christ
(1:20:42) okay so all right guys so remember at the start of this if you haven't uh
(1:20:47) watched the start of this you can go back and watch it later this guy comes in with the whole oh I'm we're just
(1:20:53) going to have a nice convers we're just going to have a good conversation I'm going to ask you a few questions we're going to ask you about you know what it's like
(1:21:00) um and Hees to act like they're going to be friends and Andrew says no let's cut the [ __ ] let's just have the debate because I know what you're going to do
(1:21:06) and now he says let's talk about Christ and you can see that he's got his little tweets ready and he's got his little he's got his little angle ready and we
(1:21:14) now now you can kind of see why Andrew did what he did at the start here the the form of Christianity or Catholicism
(1:21:21) that I was raised with when I was a kid we focus on a lot on the New Testament
(1:21:26) it was it was mostly about the teachings of Christ we didn't spend too much time on Old Testament
(1:21:31) stuff my understanding of Jesus is that he loathed uh
(1:21:38) hypocrisy more than anything uh in a tweet that you made yesterday defending the guys from fresh
(1:21:44) and fit you said the laziest form of argumentation is the appeal to hypocrisy even if myON and Walter Never
(1:21:52) follow a single rule they laid down for men be successful at dating it wouldn't mean that there were were anything wrong
(1:21:58) about those rules and how's that defense of fresan fit so I'm asking you how do
(1:22:04) you prioritize which sins or or forms of
(1:22:10) degeneracy you want to focus on well let's start with the Tweet so that we're on the same page sorry okay yeah let's
(1:22:16) go yeah let's start with the Tweet so we're on the same page how's that a defense of anybody you are uh trying to insulate
(1:22:23) them from critic ISM by pointing out that the idea that they may be Hypocrites doesn't take away from their
(1:22:31) larger contributions to young men that consume their cont oh really no I'm opening them up to criticism by saying that the laziest form of argumentation
(1:22:38) and criticizing them is a is an appeal to hypocracy because it does nothing to destroy their positions which I've done
(1:22:43) live have you I I've never been on that podcast yeah so you've never destroyed their positions
(1:22:48) live I'm asking you were you aware that I destroyed their positions were you aware that I destroyed their positions
(1:22:53) live because didn't appeal to hypocrisy back to the question I just answered your question would you would you agree
(1:22:59) that for example Jesus Christ loathed hypocrisy uh I would say that uh yeah of
(1:23:06) course there was he would call out Hypocrites but when you say abor hypocrisy you're conflating two
(1:23:13) different things so an appeal to hypocrisy as far as a fallacy for argumentation goes okay is trying to
(1:23:20) show you that if you were to say for instance let me give you an example that
(1:23:25) maybe you'll understand I'm going to dumb it way down ready sure dumb it way down yeah please you notice that I'm lighting a
(1:23:31) cigarette yeah okay you shouldn't smoke
(1:23:37) sure is it true or less true that you shouldn't smoke because I am
(1:23:42) smoking okay can we're getting my [ __ ] question don't p is it true or
(1:23:48) less true that you shouldn't smoke because I am smoking the question the question that I want to ask I answer
(1:23:53) mine you just said you would do bro what is this gaslighting I just told you I
(1:23:59) would explain it to you and you said you would engage with it you try to Veer the conversation off let me get to my
(1:24:04) question okay no not until you answer mine this is unbelievable dodging going
(1:24:10) on here because he opened up this conversation by saying do you agree that Jesus Christ loathed hypocrisy and what
(1:24:17) he's trying to do is he's got his little tweet he's got his gotcha moment and he's trying to say that and that Andrew is a hypocrite or he's say saying that
(1:24:23) fresh and fit are hypocrites and then Andrew's describing the appeal to hypocrisy and he's saying basically if I
(1:24:30) say if I'm a smoker and I say don't smoke am I a hypocrite well no because what you're saying is still true
(1:24:35) hypocrisy is a very different thing he walked into this debate and now he's obvious skating because he as soon as he
(1:24:41) get as soon as he gets gets trapped how do you pror tell answer mine bro we're not doing it we're not doing it you said
(1:24:48) you would answer it you said you would answer it and then I'll answer yours I'll answer yours after you answer mine
(1:24:54) answer your after you focus for example when you focus for example 80 90% of the time on like we're just gonna go right
(1:25:00) back to it bro I'm just how do you decide that that is more important than let's say uh myin trying to [ __ ] 50
(1:25:08) girls how do you decide that being trans is worth more of your time and your
(1:25:13) efforts to humiliate people than let's say Donald Trump's like several like sexual indis can't wait to answer your
(1:25:18) question answer M culus yeah I can't wait to answer your question as soon as you answer mine can you just answer no
(1:25:23) don't veer the convers no it was that you veered it off I literally said I would explain it to you and then asked
(1:25:29) you a question and you pivoted the one who began this by trying to ask you a question I'm G try to get this Sidetrack
(1:25:36) I'm going to no you brought up a tweet about about this fallacy I'm explaining it and you won't even answer a basic
(1:25:43) question you lunatic the point the point of this question is not so much to focus on your Tweet just the general concept
(1:25:49) of yes and I'm going to explain it to you again it is clear in Scripture that Jesus l
(1:25:54) hypocrisy like you could name a single scripture give me a break oh you gonna google it now you gonna google it now
(1:26:00) you gonna google it now hypocrites for ye make clean outside of the cup and of
(1:26:07) the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess I did I looked up
(1:26:12) like several now now let's try this close your eyes and put your hands up are the notion are you give me a single
(1:26:20) scripture you can't are you disputing the notion that Jesus Lo hypocrisy I'm
(1:26:25) saying that your context for this is wrong and so I'm G to explain it to you again so that you understand yes now the
(1:26:32) easiest way for me to demonstrate this I'm gonna do this thing and then ask you a question I want you to actually answer
(1:26:38) it I'm smoking a it you're gonna answer [ __ ] question bro it takes 10 minutes
(1:26:46) to these questions you ready I just smoke I'm smoking a
(1:26:51) cigarette yes if I tell you not to smoke a cigarette right that smoking a
(1:26:57) cigarette is bad for you is me smoking this cigarette make me less wrong or more right it would make you if you're
(1:27:04) if you're smoking a cigarette and then advising somebody else to quit smoking cigarette it would make you a hypocrite and would would me smoking a cigarette
(1:27:11) make me wrong when I tell you not to smoke one wrong or right I don't who who's to
(1:27:17) say but it would make you a hypocrite right what it oh okay so then extending that logic yes a former drug telling you
(1:27:24) not to do drugs is a hypocrite you [ __ ] [ __ ] bro if a former drug addict uhhuh
(1:27:32) relays their experience hey I made these decisions that were really terrible for like 20 years uhhuh here's why I think
(1:27:40) you making the decision to quit drugs relying on my experience here's
(1:27:46) why I think that would be a good thing how does that make somebody a hypocrite what if he was doing crack in front of you and telling you not to do
(1:27:52) crack what if he was doing crack in front of me and then asked me not to do crack yeah he said it's really bad to do
(1:27:58) this I don't understand the framing here and how it relates to is he a hypocrite how it relates and how it relates to
(1:28:05) spreading a message of recovery does that have to do with anything bro what I'm telling you is that if a crackhead
(1:28:11) is in front of you and he's smoking crack he can give you all the same experiences while he's smoking the crack cocaine and he would be no less right or
(1:28:17) wrong correct the the point of suggesting that somebody quit drugs
(1:28:22) which is a trick thing and it's like there's a certain criteria it's not as simple as just saying like hey you shouldn't do drugs but when we're
(1:28:29) talking about recovery the whole purpose of recovery which I would assume as somebody who is a Christian would would
(1:28:34) generally like in principle uh support there's a lot of Christian foundational stuff when it comes to AA the point of
(1:28:42) uh the point ofage the the point of spreading a message of recovery is to Simply help
(1:28:49) people that's all that is great how is that hypocritical so well that's my whole point how is it hypoc critical
(1:28:54) somebody's smoking crack in front of you and telling you that smoking crack is bad how does it make him a hypocrite okay I'm talking about my's hypocrisy
(1:29:02) that's great I know what you're doing and I'm get I'm asking you for the same analogy If he if a guy fine let's let's
(1:29:08) make it even more wild if a guy is slamming 18 [ __ ] and sniffing cocaine off their vaginas at the same time and
(1:29:14) tells you it's bad to do that how is it worse or not worse that
(1:29:20) he's telling you that even if he's a [ __ ] hypocrite I'm asking you how do you evaluate bro you can't
(1:29:26) [ __ ] answer you can't have you can't answer a single question you evate you can't answer a single question why would
(1:29:32) you how do you come to the calculation I'm gonna spend let's say 75% of the time talking about like trans and queer
(1:29:40) degeneracy how do you uh justify that okay so yeah this is this is bad let's
(1:29:47) read out a few super chats here guys Ryan's Slater five bucks says if you just joined the show he's matching super
(1:29:52) chats appreciate that Ryan naughty gem five bucks for Ryan for matching Ryan matches it
(1:30:00) again and we've also got here guys Ryan says if we hit 1,000 likes for the video
(1:30:07) he'll give 5050 memberships which will be great for the channel and great for the community guys so if you are watching with over 2,000 of us in the
(1:30:13) YouTube I think and 2,500 all up just hit that like button so we can get those 50 memberships going th000 likes should
(1:30:20) be very achievable John Donan for 20 asks thank you so much for that John says I like how the atheists think that
(1:30:27) they are more qualified than Christians on Christianity uh on than what a CHR yeah
(1:30:33) Jesus loed hypocrisy now let me lecture you why your understanding of Christ is wrong even though I don't believe him
(1:30:38) myself and also just like sort of Piggy backy on that point um if he believes
(1:30:44) that all morality is just subjective and that it's just all about my preferences then why would he have a problem with
(1:30:49) Andrew being a total hypocrite if Andrew wanted to live his life just being a complete hypocrite but he thought that
(1:30:55) that was a good way to do things what is the problem with that and why is your preference better than his and why are you even arguing with it
(1:31:04) why Ryan matches that appreciate it the Tex vet for 10 bucks says something you
(1:31:09) can learn from this guy is his tactics the whole angle isn't about addressing the logic it's about discounting the
(1:31:15) example perfect place to use how would you feel if you didn't eat breakfast yes exactly right um and the argument from
(1:31:22) hypocrisy honestly lowest form lowest form of debate that there is well you don't do this you don't do this so why
(1:31:28) are you saying that it's so and Andrew raises a good point it's and you can also raise the point about
(1:31:33) the murderer which is just the easiest one if somebody is a murderer or somebody killed someone they said you
(1:31:39) shouldn't murder people how are they wrong lowest form of argumentation let's
(1:31:44) Carry On by that when there are so many other sins that you could on that are
(1:31:50) just as that are just as there never a reason he loaded hypocrisy more than anything
(1:31:58) so why don't you attack I will I'll I'll go off of your standard then with the same that you go after trans I never
(1:32:06) ever ever have to make a justification for anything I do external of my own
(1:32:11) preferences by your standard dummy I'm asking you how do you internally reach
(1:32:16) that I because it's my preferences and it's just as valid as yours right I'm
(1:32:22) asking you to explain how like how do you come to just expained focus on
(1:32:27) focusing on sexual don't you understand that I don't have to justify anything if you don't
(1:32:33) have to justify anything I can just assert it's true it's me being curious you're you're and you're like wrapping
(1:32:39) it up with all this debate bro stuff I'm just asking you it's not debate bro stuff I'm explaining to you I'm
(1:32:44) explaining to you objective reality I'm explaining to you objective reality so that you understand why by
(1:32:51) you asking me I'm trying to expl entertain the question bro I'm I'm literally answering it right now no
(1:32:57) you're answering you as me to bro if you ask me to give you a justification when you yourself have no justification
(1:33:04) you're a hypocrite I'm asking you your personal experence gave it to you how can you
(1:33:11) possibly ask for justification for me outside of my own preferences when you don't appeal to that for yourself that
(1:33:18) makes you a [ __ ] hypocrite you're the hypocrite not to the SC that you are and
(1:33:24) so when we examine scripture it would matter we know for sure why would that loed
(1:33:31) hypocrisy so he must have loed you because you're being a hypocrite why don't you spend 90% of your time or or
(1:33:37) 60% whatever going after Hypocrites rather than I'm doing that right now I'm
(1:33:43) going after a hypocrite right this second let me ask you something when when Jesus asked us to be like Meek and
(1:33:49) gentle when he asked us to if we are going to issue judgment on someone we
(1:33:54) better be sure to examine our own house before we spend a lot of time thinking about how other people live their life
(1:34:01) he never said don't judge people but he very much emphasized if you're going to do that you need to spend a good amount
(1:34:09) of time looking at your own house before you do that when you are for example
(1:34:14) going after trans people with the effort of like humiliating them are you doing that in service to God or Jes to
(1:34:20) humiliate them can you give me an example are you doing are you doing you say stigma helps to uh get people on a
(1:34:26) better stigma doesn't necess necessitate stigma does not necessitate humiliation sir is it it I I agree but this is
(1:34:33) something that you like to do this is like your then give me an example of it an example of what now of me and any way
(1:34:40) shape or form harassing or or doing anything to harm a trans person you're trying to you're it's not just trans
(1:34:46) people you're doing it right that was your example inste because you ask me why I don't go after Hypocrites I'm
(1:34:51) telling you I'm going after a hypocrit your priority in this conversation it becomes about just trying to humiliate
(1:34:56) whoever you're talking to and when you talk about trans people when you talk about gay people in the way that you have in the past I've watched hours of
(1:35:03) your content give me an example when you uh threw that jab at that guy the last what's this guy David what's his name
(1:35:10) who's the guy that you just had the the the debate with that walked out on your debate it's your example mat bro why is
(1:35:20) it hard for you to be a normal person I can't remember the guy's name I'm not super familiar with we get I thought a
(1:35:26) second ago you just said I despar trans and gay people all the time you can't give me a single [ __ ] example of it
(1:35:32) fine High Lev stuff example you won't tell me the guy's name I have to give you your example I have to give you your
(1:35:38) example of MYRY guy the guy that you were debating uh didn't appreciate the way
(1:35:45) that you did your intro comment so he walked away and you took a jab at him for having a husband what was the
(1:35:50) purpose of that you mean that that was the greatest debate that has ever happened sometimes guys when I'm sad I
(1:35:56) go and watch that debate if I ever have a bad day if something ever happens that just gets me blue I'll go and watch Matt
(1:36:02) Diller Hunty Andrew Wilson debate it was the best thing ever some good super chats coming in here guys we got Ricky
(1:36:08) Rick Josie for 10 bucks says just tuning in Bring It On Jake let's go appreciate that and then RM for 20 bucks says a
(1:36:14) seeing Andrew debate these guys in college kids is fun but I'd rather see him start to regularly engage with the
(1:36:19) Harris and Dawkins level Debaters at this point he's too talented for for this in my opinion yeah guys the problem
(1:36:24) is though uh he would kill those guys Harris Dawkins any of those guys it
(1:36:31) wouldn't it wouldn't it wouldn't be a a fair debate in my opinion in my humble opinion of course but we saw what
(1:36:36) happened when he debated Matt gunti who is the sort of preeminent atheist debater he's the head of the atheist
(1:36:43) Society he Rage Quit because he got destroyed so badly in Andrew's opening mon monologue and he couldn't handle a
(1:36:50) little bit of heat he Rage Quit so these guys like when you watch Richard Dawkins
(1:36:55) and Sam Harris go up against guys like Jordan Peterson for example they grant them everything they grant them morality
(1:37:03) they grant them all of these presuppositions but when you get a guy like Andrew who's more brutal and blood sport or like guy like Jay Dyer they
(1:37:09) would just wipe them and I you guys saw this when I had yaron if you guys have watched my debate with yaron Brook and
(1:37:15) Jay Dyer I think this is one of the only times that's happens one of those sort of mainstream atheist types get put up
(1:37:21) against someone who will challenge their presuppositions and yaron Brook had nothing against J J just completely cut
(1:37:28) him off at the legs and it was just not even competitive whatsoever so if and if Andrew and Andrew has debated guys like
(1:37:35) uh like vou and Destiny and all of these guys who I would say are actually better Debaters than Dawkins and Harris um
(1:37:41) because like I'd say some of these streams actually better than them um I don't think if if if it was a one-on-one
(1:37:48) three-hour type debate with a guy like Harrison Dawkins they're sort of like rational r Pratt wouldn't be able to to
(1:37:55) cut it with a guy like Andrew with a guy like J they would I think get killed
(1:38:02) um where are we at so it's a good Super Chat though I appreciate that Ryan
(1:38:08) matches it again thank you very much John Dian for five bucks says LMFAO Hutch is sping TF Out Ryan matches the
(1:38:15) 20 bucks and we've got for eight bucks uh now now we are at his issue buy a
(1:38:22) brain cell for this full exactly I don't think he can purchase it if he could he would guys we are very close to get to
(1:38:28) that th like Mark which will give us 50 super chats and you guys can get your super chats if you're not a I mean a
(1:38:35) membership sorry 50 memberships if you guys aren't a member you'll be able to get one so Jump On In like the video
(1:38:41) that guy who insulted me called me a jackass talked a bunch of [ __ ] so I talk [ __ ] back that guy what was the what was
(1:38:47) the purpose of you bringing that up what was the purpose of me sitting there and taking it why why you why answer the
(1:38:55) question I am so people are allowed I dude how would you know I can't even get a word in when you're ready to let me
(1:39:00) speak I'll speak to it do you think do you seriously think that when Jesus
(1:39:05) instructed people to lead with empathy compassion Grace forgiveness he meant
(1:39:12) that it would be okay to like make fun of people for having butt sex do you think that uh that when Jesus made a
(1:39:18) whip out of cords and ran the money changers out of the temple at with a whip that that was hang on
(1:39:24) stop listen to church just listen to and where are gay
(1:39:29) people trying to get married sir exactly bro there is one example of
(1:39:36) him losing oh okay yeah that's the exception to the rule oh sorry wild no I'm asking
(1:39:44) you yes or no when you think of Christ's teachings of Grace and forgiveness do
(1:39:50) you think he would approve of a in somebody for being attracted to men he
(1:39:56) did and so did his Apostles not he laid
(1:40:01) out Union between a man and a woman and they become one flesh and this sort of thing so if you were going to go sin no more what would you how would you not
(1:40:07) sin anymore I'm asking you would he have favored would he have favored a tactic of like rhetorically trying to demolish
(1:40:15) someone or humiliate them possibly his Apostles did it all the time including Paul do you think Paul Paul instructed
(1:40:21) us to shoot down all arguments against Christ all of them and he would debate endlessly with people especially uh if
(1:40:28) you read Corinthians you'll see these debates non-stop happening yes he absolutely eviscerated them if I if I go
(1:40:35) back through hang on if I go back through all of the Saints in my church many of them were Masters at debate in
(1:40:40) fact in the very first uh uh Council I A guy got knocked out he got knocked out physically for having the wrong Doctrine
(1:40:46) he got decked in the face for having the wrong Doctrine yes Christianity is not a
(1:40:52) be nice religion kindness is great yes but it's not kind for me to lie to you sir I'm asking you if you believe that
(1:41:00) Jesus would cosign on trying to humiliate trans people I'm saying that Jesus and his Apostles did it all the
(1:41:06) time Jesus tried to humiliate people he went through he he can you give me an
(1:41:11) example to humiliate who did Jesus give the church to Peter his
(1:41:18) Apostles Peter was no he made them all Bishops he made all of them Bishops sir all of them okay so he gave his church
(1:41:24) to his Apostles right okay and did his Apostles go off to make um and continue
(1:41:31) with the Cannons that we now consider to be the Bible and inside of those cannons who we had the authority from did they
(1:41:37) not did Paul not say specifically not to be a homosexual did he not specifically condemn them did he not specifically
(1:41:43) tell you the way in which a man and a woman are supposed to unite did Paul not swear in his own uh um uh cannons
(1:41:51) because he did did Paul not debate in his own cannons cuz he did all of those things are true did he tell
(1:41:58) you yes he already got caught in the Trap guys when he when when Andrew said that well Christianity is not about just
(1:42:05) sort of letting everybody walk all over you all the time it's not about just just forgiving absolutely everything all
(1:42:10) the time and and just having no boundaries whatsoever that's not what it's about you know and Jesus you know
(1:42:15) he change he chased the money changers out of the out of the uh out of the temple so this is why I like these so
(1:42:22) and somebody who's pretty new to Christianity myself and somebody who doesn't really like to speak on it too often that's why I like these guys who
(1:42:27) will get in and have these really vicious debates and who will take on the secularists because you know if if the
(1:42:33) doctrine is wrong I want to see their their arguments get destroyed if if if they can but I it just never happens the
(1:42:38) Christians always seem to win these debates um and I like this more sort of masculine rugged version of it where you
(1:42:45) can actually defend yourself and stand up for yourself and it's not about just being a dmat all the time so let me know what you guys think about that in the
(1:42:50) comment comments because I know we got a lot of Christians that are a lot smarter than me in the comments um abstract for
(1:42:56) five bucks says Andrew versus Muslim Lon was my favorite yeah that was an an amazing debate and I've had Muslim
(1:43:02) Lantern on the channel before and like you know he's a sharp guy but the thing is Andrew's argument was too creative
(1:43:08) for him if you guys have seen this debate a lot of the time when Christians debate Muslims they'll they'll debate on
(1:43:13) the morality of whether or not it's right or wrong and the age of consent and they'll say yeah but you have the wrong age of consent and so do you but
(1:43:20) Andrew came in with a really creative argument which is is that for a girl who is as young as Aisha who was Muhammad's
(1:43:28) um who Muhammad consummated his marriage with when she was 9 years old I believe the vaginal Canal is only like two
(1:43:34) inches or something like that and there was nothing he there was no response that he could give to that and it's a really creative argument that's what was
(1:43:41) brilliant about that particular debate because it wasn't just your theology bad well your theology does the same thing
(1:43:47) and it was a creative one that he had no answer for and he he ended up just saying oh no I'm offended you can't say

(1:45:43) guys can come in and Gobble up from Ryan we'll have so many members in the chat either Jesus or or Peter did he tell you
(1:45:49) that the way to try to convert someone to to Christ would be through humiliation sometimes it works through
(1:45:56) Parable sometimes it works through argumentation we see this through the answering my question you talk about not
(1:46:01) answering my question or me not answering your questions I just answered here I'm gonna answer it directly as directly as I possibly can that's what I
(1:46:08) that's what I yes Jesus Christ gave the authority of his church to his Apostles and his Apostles went out and argued
(1:46:13) with people in other countries and often humiliated and shamed them so yes I think that Jesus Christ endorsed it
(1:46:19) because Jesus Christ gave the keys to the church to his Apostles sir and guys just really quickly uh Andrew's
(1:46:26) team said that they would teach me how to do Tik Tok invasions so that we can do them here on Rattlesnake TV as well
(1:46:31) so give me uh wise in the chat if you'd like to see a Tik Tok Invasion on Rattlesnake TV and if you'd join in if
(1:46:37) John Donan if he's still in here I'm know he'd he'd be Keen to jump in and a couple of the others so give me wise in the chat if you guys would like to see
(1:46:43) rattlesnake TV Tik Tok invasions where we go in and we debate and troll the libs on Tik Tok well we we have can I be
(1:46:51) any more direct than that we obviously have a very different understanding when we're talking about like the two golden
(1:46:57) rules that Jesus went by some people asking what Tik Tok
(1:47:02) invasions are it's what they do on The Crucible where they go in to these liberal spaces where they're all like doing these little Tik Tok debates and
(1:47:08) we go in and we just debate them we rip them apart we troll them and then when they kick me out then you guys all come
(1:47:14) in after me and you guys all troll them as well that's what a Tik Tok invasion is talked about if you're going to try
(1:47:20) to preach to people and convert them to Christianity you lead with compassion immediately ready to forgive so when you
(1:47:28) talk about trying to convert let's foress requires repentance it does but he also said that
(1:47:34) you should be immediately eagerly ready to forgive knowing that you eagerly ready to forgive you are you gonna
(1:47:41) repent I don't believe you I don't know how I don't believe you because I think
(1:47:46) that for you this is an exercise in Pride I think for you it's an exercise in Pride what are you talking about but
(1:47:53) that may be but I'm not bound by the same religious Dogma as you your religion tells you that's true go
(1:48:01) ahead I don't know why this guy keep people am I freezing yeah you were
(1:48:07) freezing on my end I'm sorry you're gonna have to repeat what you just said I'm not sure how you could justify
(1:48:13) a position of trying to make yourself look good in in in the humiliation of
(1:48:19) other people in service of Jesus Christ unambiguously preached a message of
(1:48:26) Grace and forgiveness I don't know how you could immediately shift I'm going to I'm GNA help you do you want to
(1:48:32) understand that you're making presuppositions which are absolutely wild to me for one thing I'm an orthodox
(1:48:37) I'm an Orthodox Christian inducted into the church three-year catechism the entire nine yards in order to be
(1:48:44) inducted into the Orthodox Church do you know a single thing about the Orthodox religion at all it's a good alter so
(1:48:51) then why in the world would you say from my world view X is true you have no [ __ ] idea what my worldview even is I'm talking about scripture I'm talking
(1:48:56) about scripture we don't appeal to Simply scripture that would be exog Jesus that would be something that Protestants do so in this spot a normal
(1:49:04) human being would simply say oh you don't let me tell you about it you are so let me tell you about it eager to
(1:49:10) score a dunk I don't know how you're doing this in service of Jesus Christ I don't understand why you think that I
(1:49:16) have to put up with your stupid lame [ __ ] when you can't even make a competent argument you don't but listen
(1:49:21) I'm not bound by the same religious Dogma as you how do you know you don't even know my religious Dogma by your own
(1:49:27) admission because I'm a Catholic and you said you were you're not a [ __ ] Catholic I was raised
(1:49:34) Catholic I'm not a I'm not a say the Lord's Prayer Catholic Our Father who
(1:49:39) art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our
(1:49:45) trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil amen
(1:49:51) hey I can't believe maybe you were actually raised a Catholic for 11 years
(1:49:58) I went to parochial school it's been a while excellent maybe that's the first true thing you said this entire debate
(1:50:03) it's been a while so I'm a little rusty but I do recall learning about scripture
(1:50:09) and when we talked about Jesus Christ and eagerness to forgive was a huge
(1:50:14) tenant that we learned about back then that was like the number one chief goal
(1:50:19) that we were taught and when I watched I mean you can enlighten me about how
(1:50:24) Orthodox Christianity differs and how they I guess favor a policy of like trying to hum Orthodox the Orthodox
(1:50:30) Orthodox Christians largely have always operated off of a form of argumentation
(1:50:36) for everything from church doctrine to putting the Cannons together all the way back to the original Apostles as they
(1:50:42) have Apostolic succession try to understand that the Catholic Church Schism away from Orthodoxy not the other
(1:50:47) way around this is why you see the distinction here yes of course we're called to shoot down all arguments I'm
(1:50:53) glad that you said the Lord's Prayer perhaps that's your first step to Redemption I'm glad that you remembered
(1:50:58) it and you know it must have had more of an impact in your life than any of this Progressive [ __ ] because you don't
(1:51:04) know the scientific method you don't know the rules of logic but at least you can state that so maybe it gave you some
(1:51:09) sort of moral foundation and that's good it did I I no no seriously it did I I don't I don't believe that Jesus was
(1:51:15) literally the Son of God I don't take scripture literally but when we how are you cathol that's not what well that's
(1:51:21) not Catholic doct because they do right I that's why I no longer identify as a Catholic to be honest with
(1:51:27) you I never believed in that but when we're talking about the the teachings of Jesus Christ that we learned about in scripture of course those things
(1:51:33) influenced me and so I remember at a really young age like like asking myself like okay before I'm not I'm not perfect
(1:51:40) of this obviously like everybody else see this is what Rachel Wilson calls I don't know if Rachel coin this term but
(1:51:45) she calls boyfriend Jesus she had because all of these sort of women uh will will come and say yeah I believe in
(1:51:52) in the teachings of Jesus but they won't take any of the sort of more controversial ideas of Christianity in the modern world they'll use boyfriend
(1:51:59) Jesus nice guy Jesus sort of shoulder to cry on lift to the airport jacket when I'm cold type Jesus and this is sort of
(1:52:05) what he does as well it's this very feminine view of it it's like yeah well Jesus was just a nice guy and he forgave
(1:52:11) everyone for everything so you should never cast any sort of judgment whatsoever because Jesus was nice you
(1:52:17) should be nice to absolutely everyone at all times and have no boundaries whatsoever that's what you should do because Jesus was nice
(1:52:23) let's read out a few more guys I think about 60 70 likes to go until we get those 50 memberships guys so if you have
(1:52:29) not liked that like the video then I would appreciate that the poor man's SP for five buck says I joined our current
(1:52:34) church when our pastors covered modernity we welcomed everyone but don't hold back on rejecting LGBT woke
(1:52:40) Concepts you shouldn't you should do that in the church it should not be allowed uh Ryan Slater for five bucks
(1:52:46) says missed a match RM for 20 bucks says I agree he would defeat Dawkins Harris of the world
(1:52:53) but I'm saying his talent is worthy of being a household name and is almost wasting time with these lowlevel
(1:52:58) Debaters I actually think that when with these low-level Debaters uh these people
(1:53:04) sort of hold the same ideology as such a broad sades of the population like when you look at whatever podcast this is the
(1:53:11) current cultural norm so if you have this really sort of deep intellectual debate with a guy like Harrison Dawkins
(1:53:17) there will be people who enjoy it and people who get something from it but if you watch Andrew Wilson in a whole panel
(1:53:23) of just regular modern people and modern women or these modern sort of uh low low
(1:53:29) tier secularists these are the clips that go viral and these are the these are the clips that allow people to watch and be like huh that's that argument is
(1:53:36) so easily destroyed like the whole just that argument that we saw before about uh trans people we have to affirm their
(1:53:43) identity because it harms them it's such a low tier argument that is used so regularly but it's so easily defeated
(1:53:50) because you just say I lying hurts me lying harms me so who who's
(1:53:56) harmed more it's not quantifiable but they use this all the time so I think that it's really effective and he can do
(1:54:03) both but it's effective to watch these people get destroyed so anyways where
(1:54:10) were we uh Ryan matching it with 20 bucks RM great comment again RM is on
(1:54:16) fire as well slowboy whiteboard says for five bucks I'm looking forward to Andrew vers Tim and TI invasions we will get to
(1:54:23) them guys if you guys want to see those Tik Tok invasions we will learn how to do it and we will get to it and I'll do the Andrew vers Tim debate as well maybe
(1:54:29) even see if Andrew wants to come on because to be honest guys it's all about God and it's about the nature of God and
(1:54:35) I'm a bit of a [ __ ] so that sort of stuff goes over my head I have to really think hard about that sometimes the more metaphysical conversations so um might
(1:54:42) get Andrew on to chat about that one with me uh John Don says for five bucks LOL I would be honor to jump on jump on
(1:54:49) your Invasion says gay o Conor saw that in the Invasion the other night very funny stuff the Tex V for 10 bucks says
(1:54:55) but remember it's high level trolling use logic to point out their lack of intelligence don't just prattle and do
(1:55:01) low-level trolling for anybody who follow who followers or follow once Jake gets D boot I think he's talking about
(1:55:07) the invasions there uh we do actually debate these people on the invasions but they the thing is they just mute you and
(1:55:12) they kick you so sometimes it's just better to have a laugh and just sort of troll them but if they want to debate then we are absolutely here for it Ryan
(1:55:20) matching slow boy and matching the Tex vet 20 gifted memberships from
(1:55:28) Ryan Lans Noir for two bucks says more like friend zone Jesus frames friend
(1:55:33) zone Jesus is a good one actually yeah they've they've all got their version of it uh Ryan 10 gifted memberships as well
(1:55:40) guys I think we're pretty close to those 50 gifted memberships then he's going to let me know how many more likes we need
(1:55:46) everybody else but before I take actions I try to ask myself like how would I feel if if this was being done to me
(1:55:52) this was something that I learned from Christ's teachings and this also what the categorical imperative is built off
(1:55:57) of too this doesn't seem to be this doesn't seem to be like a huge priority to me like if you were literally trying
(1:56:03) to convert me to Christianity 40 more locks until we get to a, you're getting there by trying to these dunks is that
(1:56:09) how you this normally for it's never for you I never think from a sense of of egotistical Pride from a progressive
(1:56:15) scumbag that I'm ever going to be able to BR you are you are you you are do you want my answer or not you sure yes well
(1:56:22) then if you do you have to be quiet so thing is is that when I'm dealing with a progressive scumbag who doesn't answer
(1:56:28) any questions that I ask him I have to beat every single one of them out of him he doesn't understand the basics of philosophy doesn't understand the basics
(1:56:34) of science doesn't understand the basics of any of these things I don't hold out a lot of hope that a person like that has much logic and I can convert them
(1:56:40) but you know the thing is is hundreds of thousands of people listen to my debates
(1:56:46) all across the internet millions of people have seen my Clips across the internet there's thousands of people
(1:56:52) watching me live right this second right this second I'm trying to convince them
(1:56:58) and the best way to do that is to give a contrast between my grounding foundational principles and yours which
(1:57:04) sound like lunacy you're trying to tell hang on I'm telling you you're trying to explain to people that all all of the
(1:57:10) world everything in it everything which is moral is coming from the grounding of
(1:57:16) your personal preferences meaning it comes out of your own mind when people hear that the know they do they go what
(1:57:23) the [ __ ] is this crazy [ __ ] talking about sounds absurd to them so if you think that forms of argumentation I get
(1:57:30) hundreds upon hundreds of DMS weekly well not weekly but monthly hundreds upon hundreds of them monthly saying to
(1:57:36) me thank you so much this is [ __ ] awesome somebody's finally fighting back no Christians aren't supposed to be
(1:57:42) [ __ ] that I'm not changing Minds because they think I am yeah and I wish you all the success in the world I'm
(1:57:47) being serious when I say that I don't watch you know if you're prosperous and doing what you do and you love what you what you do that's great my I guess my
(1:57:53) question to you right now would be how do you feel like your movement is that's three sorry I was wrong 3,000 live
(1:57:58) viewers at the moment sir that's great brother I'm I'm sincerely happy for you how do you feel like your movement is
(1:58:06) doing when we look at declining Church attendance when we look at
(1:58:11) plummeting uh faith in God especially among young people when we look at uh
(1:58:17) how the Republican party has been punished for for essentially six or
(1:58:22) seven years now pretty pretty straight by leaning into uh decisions like dos
(1:58:28) and decisions like Banning IVF it seems to me from the outside looking in your movement is struggling do you think that
(1:58:34) you are helping your Movement by rooting it in Pride and meanness the opposite is
(1:58:40) true one I'm not rooting anything in Pride and meanness I would say that the opposite from my vantage point you from my vantage point you can't justify what
(1:58:48) even meanness or pride is because everything is just a sense of preferences that's one but two when we
(1:58:53) look at when we look at the issue when we look at the issue which is here no you [ __ ] idiots can't even reproduce
(1:58:59) secularist can't even reproduce why would I give a [ __ ] about the failed ideology of ideolog who don't even
(1:59:08) reproduce they have they and you know what it's plummeting everywhere that there's a secularist nation it's
(1:59:14) plummeting think you're gonna outbreed us right that's what the show we'll see how that goes because
(1:59:20) young people are rejecting religion this is no they're not rejecting it what they're doing instead out in the data
(1:59:26) they're rejecting protestantism and they're going for the right I'm asking you and it might be good for your channel you you get these thousands of
(1:59:33) views and you get these hundreds of DMS and and and you I'm assume you make like a decent amount of money doing this stuff we
(1:59:38) have personal success we hit the thousand how do you justify saying that
(1:59:44) your movement is growing when every metric that we can look at tells us that
(1:59:49) faith in God is on the decline worldwide prove it what do you mean prove it do
(1:59:55) you need me to look up Pew research is that what you need me to look up yeah that's going to be United States numbers you just said
(2:00:01) worldwide right now Christianity is the number one religion but I think around you probably know more than me but I
(2:00:07) think it's around 32% right can you tell me and substantiate that Christianity is
(2:00:14) globally shrinking and then Islam but you know what's number three is e- religion e- religion is 17 % it used to
(2:00:23) be that 98% of the world believed in God and I don't know if CLA you made the
(2:00:29) claim that you made that Christianity globally is shrinking why why is it relevant to to uh have a discussion
(2:00:35) about like what's going on in Africa or you [ __ ] brought it up why are you asking me because when we're talking
(2:00:41) about the United States oh now we're gonna shift it to the United States I thought you just got done saying globally it's shrinking you shifted it
(2:00:48) did you look up no you said it what do you mean I brought this up I talked about how in the United States the
(2:00:55) Republic said you said globally Christianity Republican party has been floundering for seven years we're seeing
(2:01:02) that voters are punishing them for these policies that are born out of religious
(2:01:07) conservatism we see that there is declining Church attendance we see that there is declining faith in God so how
(2:01:15) are you going to sit here and tell me that your movement is thriving right now well let me help you out you do you know
(2:01:22) how many people are inside of the United States currently it's around 336 million okay now if your population dips under
(2:01:29) two for your reproduction rate can you sustain a population of 330 million no I
(2:01:35) think you need 2.2 or something to that effect can you tell us what our birth rate is right now I think it's around
(2:01:41) 1.8 I could be wrong and dropping right uh I I believe so I don't know if it's
(2:01:47) precipitously dropping right now but it's not sustainable correct yes okay so then if in 80 years
(2:01:53) we still had 336 people or 336 million people uh how would that be possible if
(2:01:59) we dip under reproduction rates but we would either the population would uh
(2:02:05) would lessen or we would uh have immigrants come in we would have immigrants come in where would those
(2:02:10) immigrants be coming in from all over the world bro and are they
(2:02:15) religious usually these immigrants sometimes yeah but we're talking about you need to convince young
(2:02:21) people bro and right now there AR there aren't going to be young people because we're not
(2:02:26) reproducing you seem to think that you guys are going to breed us out which is fine you can believe that but you are I
(2:02:33) don't just believe it that's the trends bro like what do you want me to say I just logically watch you through it you
(2:02:39) are assuming that all these kids you're gonna crank out are going to just gleefully go along with your religion
(2:02:46) they usually do rejecting it at some point yeah usually they do when we're talk wait how is this okay again when
(2:02:52) we're talking about declining faith in God it's plummeting the most amongst young people so there is a substantial
(2:03:00) amount of kids in this country that are rejecting religion now maybe they change maybe they find God in their 20s or 30s
(2:03:05) or whatever yeah I just don't know where you're getting this confidence when we look at the trends are clearly not good
(2:03:11) for the religious movement in this country yeah it's funny do you think it's possible do you possible do you
(2:03:16) think it's possible that one of the reasons why we're seeing these declining Trends yeah is because you guys have now
(2:03:22) culturally rooted your movement in meanness no I don't let me explain again
(2:03:28) you don't think that has anything to do with it I'll explain but you have to stop talking remember I didn't interrupt you even once in this whole Spiel sure
(2:03:34) I'll let you talk go ahead right so now as we go through this try to understand that as the reproduction rate dips under
(2:03:41) you being able to replace your own population and this is due to decadence which comes from the secular left what's
(2:03:48) happening is it is true that uh Protestant Rel are on the decline but here's something that you didn't
(2:03:54) compensate for and you can look this up on Pew and you can look this up on all of your research terms when people do
(2:03:59) move towards religion they're moving far more right they're moving towards more traditional religions which why you're going to start seeing the growth of
(2:04:06) things like Orthodoxy and Catholicism globally anything which streams towards
(2:04:11) traditionalism that's what young people are moving towards if they're part of the counterculture now as you might know
(2:04:17) the counterculture tends to win inside of this nation right now that's conservatism not progressivism ISM and
(2:04:22) if you think that it's trendy for people to have cut their penises off 12 years ago and uh and counting up you also see
(2:04:29) the counterculture moving back against that these things operate on a pendulum you and your ideology can give no ODS
(2:04:37) everywhere we look is decadence and Decay and people are [ __ ] sick of it including young people those young
(2:04:43) people as they get older they get more conservative as well and the immigrants you going to have to pump in in order to
(2:04:48) reproduce your population are coming from Mostly Catholic Nations that's why you're starting to see protestantism on
(2:04:55) a decline as Hispanics are increasing that's one of the primary reasons for that nobody ever compensates for the
(2:05:01) fact that the one of the biggest problems with leftist ideology and secularism is that it led to a
(2:05:07) reproduction crisis and now you're going to have to pump in Christians who reproduce in order to compensate for the fact that your population's dying in the
(2:05:14) west everywhere in the west yes absolutely right and you see
(2:05:19) this happening a lot and even you see guys like Andrew becoming more popular online these sort of staunch Christians
(2:05:26) when sort of 10 15 years ago that was not the way that the cultural winds were blowing but because of the level of
(2:05:32) decadence and the level of cultural degeneracy that we've seen people are looking at it and seeing it as like a
(2:05:38) dark demonic spiritual Force at play and actually looking at it and this is how I sort of came to some semblance of Faith
(2:05:45) um initially was that during the whole pandemic stuff that happened I was looking around and seeing like evil I
(2:05:51) looked into it and started to become a bit more redpilled about the way that the world works and I was like this is actually evil there is evil forces at
(2:05:57) play is there a good and at this time I was like a full-on atheist and then I started to look into what is good what
(2:06:03) does it mean to be good what is good and evil does anybody have a good theory of this does anybody have like a reasonable
(2:06:08) theory about what good and evil actually is and then looked into the religions and uh Christianity provides the most
(2:06:15) comprehensive of understanding of of the metaphysical idea of what good and evil
(2:06:20) is and what objectivity really is so we are seeing this because people are seeing all of this degeneracy and it's
(2:06:26) so antithetical to our nature it's so in contrast to what we actually what we
(2:06:31) want and what and what we what we view as as healthy that we we reject it
(2:06:36) completely and then the the antithesis to that to that degeneracy is religion
(2:06:43) and is Christianity and is is Faith that's the antidote to all of those sorts of things so we we're seeing this
(2:06:48) and we're also seeing the cultural pendulum and the political pendulum swing worldwide in Europe for example
(2:06:54) people are becoming a lot more based in Europe you've got uh the the alternative
(2:06:59) for deuts land in Germany you've got the French parties you've even got reform UK you've got the right-wing Austrian party
(2:07:06) you've got the Dutch farmer party all of these uh countries that are sort of like liberal uh democracy sort of uh hot
(2:07:14) Poots over there there's actually these based movements happening and this is only going to increase and then I
(2:07:21) actually think that the Next Generation the Generation X that's coming up and then what's what's below them there's a
(2:07:26) generation below them I'm a millennial then you got Gen X and then you got the the other ones but I think that they're
(2:07:32) going to be even more based and that over the next 20 years or so we're going to see even more Bas coming up and it's
(2:07:38) going to be cool to be traditional again it's going to be cool to to to for women to think motherhood is aspirational in
(2:07:43) itself as opposed to that motherhood is some sort of like a trap you know some sort of like slavery and for guys to
(2:07:50) actually want to take masculine responsibility and accountability that's going to be aspirational again and uh
(2:07:56) I'm actually reasonably positive about that and you look at the mathematics of it like Andrew said a lot of the immigrants that are coming in they are
(2:08:02) Catholic you go to South America I'm in Argentina at the moment pretty feminist here but a lot of these countries very
(2:08:08) very religious so there's that and then there's also the fact that religious people just breed more so very true
(2:08:14) let's read out some super chats here guys rattlesnake TV what a legend gives gifts 10 memberships love that guy
(2:08:22) Devon the dude five memberships as well lot of new members guys we're going to be seeing some emojis here Jonathan
(2:08:28) diner for five bucks says Ryan wears the 50 memberships guys Ryan is dealing with credit card fraud at the moment the bank
(2:08:34) thinks that he is being fraudulent and you know this is what he's having to deal with but I'm sure that he'll he'll
(2:08:40) be he'll be back soon enough and John says gen Z is in their 20s right now
(2:08:46) current generation is Gen Alpha even heard that also what denomination of Christian are you I
(2:08:52) haven't uh I haven't picked a denomination yet but uh we will see about that Jonathan it's simply not true
(2:08:59) when we're talking about Gen X and younger that that they get uh more conservative with age for older
(2:09:06) Generations that was the case what we're observing in the voting trends when it comes to Gen X and younger is they are
(2:09:13) becoming more Progressive as they get older not more conservative show me the evidence we can look at we can look at
(2:09:19) it in the exit polls of every election in the last like six eight years that's not no show me show me the polling
(2:09:26) evidence that this is true show me the polling evidence that Gen X are becoming more conservative as they get older no
(2:09:32) Millennials never I've never seen Millennials and Zoomers not Millennials no they're not show me prove it you show
(2:09:39) me you made the claim [ __ ] you made the claim young people that young people
(2:09:45) are becoming more or will become more conservative as they get older when we look at
(2:09:51) look at evidence that's not true exit polls that you voted for Democrats doesn't even mean that you're not
(2:09:56) conservative we can observe that Gen X and Millennials have been shifting more
(2:10:02) to the left as they get older show me the evidence they exit polls from the last okay let's just look at the exit
(2:10:09) polls then we'll go over them together right now pull them up pull them
(2:10:20) up let's look at your
(2:10:28) evidence facts lazy Noir need to recapture those institutions that have been well and truly commandeered by
(2:10:34) these liberal scumbags education and media you need to get those universities back and Charlie
(2:10:40) Kirk's doing a good job of getting on the campuses and spreading some great propaganda which we
(2:10:45) love a lot of people think Gen X is a lost cause I think I kind of disagree with this Jake here so
(2:10:54) in I don't think so I think voted for B start with what you're looking at so
(2:10:59) that I can pull it up on my end sure how where's the chat you don't even need to send it in chat just tell
(2:11:05) me what it is CNN X exit polls 2020 and 2022 they they they interview 15,000
(2:11:18) people okay what to start with uh there's an age divided in four
(2:11:24) categories but if you go below that they do six categories okay and that should be the case for
(2:11:32) both okay so what we saw in
(2:11:38) 2020 is this 2020 we saw 40 to 49 swung for Biden uh
(2:11:45) 54% to 44% okay we we saw uh 30 to 39 swing for
(2:11:51) Biden 51% to 46% okay we saw 20 to 25 54% to 43% and we saw 18 to 24 obviously
(2:12:00) overwhelmingly go for Biden 65 to 31% okay now there was a swing in 2022 but
(2:12:06) we also have to factor in historical context every time uh an incumbent president faces their first set of
(2:12:13) midterms typically there's going to be uh an energized opposition and so they
(2:12:18) typically will lose Congress okay but even in this case 30 to 39 year olds went for Democrats uh 54 to 43% 25 to 29
(2:12:27) year olds uh swung far to the uh uh to the to the left for Biden 65 to
(2:12:33) 33 um 18 to 24 was 61 to 36 I'm still waiting for you to make the case for how
(2:12:40) in any way this makes this proves that as people get older they don't get more conservative we're looking at Gen X and
(2:12:46) Millennials are holding in their majority support for liberals no well no
(2:12:52) that's not first of all that's not even what the exit poll show you have a 2022 swing that's one and then on top of that
(2:12:58) even if conservatives turned out and voted for Biden over Trump there could be reasons external to that that would
(2:13:05) still not prove guys how often do we see uh videos
(2:13:11) that go viral of like conservative gets destroyed by [ __ ] or conservative gets
(2:13:16) destroyed by liberal or lgbtq woki destroys you just don't see that and
(2:13:23) it's not even just due to algorithms it's just due to the fact that that people that first of all it's very hard
(2:13:29) for these people to actually destroy any conservative unless the conservative was a terrible debator because the ideas are so absurd that they espouse but also
(2:13:37) because this is the kind people want to see that people want to see these ridiculous ideas getting destroyed so
(2:13:43) the the Gen x's and the Millennials and the Gen Alphas are the ones who are on the internet and if this is what's
(2:13:48) really popular and popping off then that's says something that says something prove that
(2:13:54) they don't become more conservative as they get older that's absurd also you can look at the financial time in the US
(2:13:59) Gallop here I'll give you counter I'm gonna give you counter data in the US Gallup data shows that after decades
(2:14:06) where the Sexes were each spread roughly equally across liberal and conservative worldviews women age 18 to 30 are now 30
(2:14:12) percentage points more liberal than their male contemporaries that Gap took just six years to open up this is very
(2:14:18) much spread across sex age and and as people get older nope they do
(2:14:23) become more conserva including the women and when it comes to the gender gap men almost always do so you're incorrect
(2:14:30) across the board so so far we have not seen conclusive data to support the
(2:14:35) notion that Gen X and Millennials are making a significant shift to conservatism it hasn't happened yet you
(2:14:42) can make the argument that it's going to happen just like you can make the argument that man I can show you Global numbers that this is the case Germany
(2:14:50) Germany Al shows a 30-point gap between increasingly conservative young men and Progressive female contemporaries and in
(2:14:57) the UK the Gap is 25 points the United States 30 points in Poland last year almost half of the men aged 18 to 21
(2:15:04) back the hard right Confederation party this is a global Trend you [ __ ] you're using CNN exit polls with 15,000 people
(2:15:12) to make a case they don't become conservative it's not it's not just CNN exit polls you can find plenty of other
(2:15:18) data to show show it I just gave you I just gave it to you on a platter sure give me a moment I'll take a
(2:15:38) moment Rick Josie for 20 bucks says been a Christian for over 20 years and don't
(2:15:43) see the point of peing dominations love to hear a good argument for it let me know in the comments guys what do you
(2:15:49) think I think there are some denominations that particularly bad um and particularly like sort of um
(2:15:55) antithetical to to the actual teachings and they they tend to take a much more let's say modern approach and this is
(2:16:01) what when you see a lot of churches that have the sort of LGBT pastors and um
(2:16:07) they don't sort of follow the same patriarchal structure but let me know in the comments what you guys think about denominations I'm actually curious to
(2:16:12) hear your thoughts about it have to link you no you can just tell me what it is I'll pull it up well it's a video well I
(2:16:19) can't pull it up if you're linking in on Discord you have to send it on Twitter and no I have no interest in watching a
(2:16:25) video I want numbers and data well ostensibly they go through numbers in this video but but I'm I'm I'm surprised
(2:16:32) have you genuinely have you genuinely not seen any uh articles just went
(2:16:37) through the Gallup data globally for you to show that the shift between genders is there but even then that women are
(2:16:44) becoming more conservative the older they get yes you pointed to you pointed to this interesting this and it is
(2:16:50) interesting this interesting gender divide that's emerging amongst like uh really young people like younger than
(2:16:56) gen what's what's after genz gen Al gen Alpha yeah there's there's this huge split that's going on where it it it is
(2:17:02) true that according to surveys we're seeing young men swing to the right in a way that we haven't seen in quite some time what we're also seeing is young
(2:17:09) women are swinging to the left by slight do they do but as they get older you see
(2:17:15) that Gap start to shrink and you know why that is tell me why you think that is where hold on where we seeing that
(2:17:21) Gap start to shrink when because because of marriage it's because of marriage and relationship so women often tend to vote
(2:17:28) single people women often stop women often tend to vote how their husbands
(2:17:34) vote sure yeah that's why that happens I'm not sure that's true but fine it's
(2:17:40) true yeah it's true and so that's why that happens and so that's why you see that's why you see that divide and if
(2:17:46) the if the population Gap continues to shrink and you you stop reproducing you have less and less and less young people
(2:17:52) to old people older people who are much more conservative probably going to vote much more conservatively how and by the
(2:17:59) way you can hardly even get young people to the polls this is true and this is something that I don't love but how do you explain
(2:18:08) 2018 2020 202020 or uh 2022 and all the
(2:18:13) special elections that have occurred over the country when you look at your conservative movement this is a serious
(2:18:18) question when you look at your conservative movement right now electorally do you feel like you're winning yeah I think that we're actually
(2:18:26) destined to win there's no way we can lose let me get some water real
(2:18:35) quick bro I just let you I just let you go through it 2020 2022 and in the slew
(2:18:43) of special elections we're talking state legislatures that have been flipped State Governor seats have that have been
(2:18:48) flipped State Supreme Courts that have been f I don't understand where you derive that
(2:18:54) sense of uh currently um winning your your movement
(2:19:00) is not currently winning don't you understand that you're asking two different questions and that you're
(2:19:06) conflating bro I just let you I just let you go through it so why don't you just calm down and let me rebut what you just
(2:19:12) said sure you're asking two different question the first question is how are we currently doing and the second
(2:19:19) question this was actually the first question why do you have optimism for the future I'm answering to two not to
(2:19:26) one my optimis so really interesting I'm reading this chat that you guys have got going on about the
(2:19:31) denominations um and it's interesting to see the different denominations that you
(2:19:36) guys all are now let me tell you what I think I've been to Fair few churches over the last few years or so and the
(2:19:43) one thing that always strikes me is that when I think about Christianity and when I think about going to church I think
(2:19:48) about it as something I take really seriously uh like when you when you're going into the church and when you're worshiping
(2:19:53) and when you're sort of confessing and and all these sort of things it's something that's meant to be done in a in a really serious way and sometimes I
(2:20:00) feel like some of the progressive churches the more sort of like Progressive modern churches that you see it doesn't feel serious it feels like
(2:20:06) sort of just like anything goes there's not really much accountability but in some of the old school like the the
(2:20:13) Orthodox churches that you see for example it just feels like there's more gravitas about it feels like there's more like weight to the to the
(2:20:19) ceremonies um and like when I think about I don't know maybe it's just like because I'm a young red-blooded male
(2:20:25) when I think about Christianity I think about like the I think about de fault you know I think about it in that regard in
(2:20:32) terms of like the Knight Templar and like the the what's it called the um a mental blank the uh Crusades and
(2:20:42) and all that sort of stuff that's what I think I think about serious stuff Conquering the world know let me know
(2:20:49) what you guys think more of it to that because sometimes you know with the sort of more Progressive churches it doesn't
(2:20:54) feel serious you know and it feels like it's like sort of a losing recipe but anyways for I'm enjoying reading your
(2:21:00) your comments future is based on current trends which show a reproduction crisis and it does show that as people get
(2:21:07) older especially as the gender begins to gappify when it comes to conservative and female Politics as we enter into a
(2:21:14) lesser amount of reproduction I think over the next 60 70 80 90 years you're going to see a much more conservative
(2:21:20) populace that's what the trends actually Bear out what you're talking about is movements which are happening right now
(2:21:27) those movements are based around populism populism is based around counter culturalism the counterculture
(2:21:33) is conservative that's why populism is pushed by the conservative movement in the next 20 years you're
(2:21:39) going to see that shift back that's just the way it is just like how liberal progressives were able to shift it over 20 30 year span we'll do the exact same
(2:21:46) thing the other direction I can understand like I said
(2:21:51) and I may disagree with your with your with your thinking um because I don't think you've established that uh
(2:21:57) Christians Simply Having more babies than uh secular or atheist people or whatever it necessarily means that those
(2:22:03) kids are going to grow up to be conservative especially when some are going to drop off that's true especially
(2:22:09) when we look at the the the trends that we're currently seeing with young people in this country which is that they're
(2:22:15) overwhelmingly turning away from religion and they overwhelmingly don't vot necessarily not necessar they will
(2:22:20) vote they and when they do vote they'll probably be more conservative because that's what the trend
(2:22:26) show I don't I I don't know what trends you have been looking at I just gave it to you from Gallup I just showed them to
(2:22:33) you from Gallup and by the way do you know one of the reasons Europe is becom don't think that you have established
(2:22:38) that I don't I don't think you have established that let's go do you want to go over him again no I would like to
(2:22:44) look at these numbers yes but but I don't I'm not sure what you're exactly my point is to show you how is it all
(2:22:51) Western Nations all Western Nations okay all of them show as people get older at
(2:22:58) all of them show this they become more conservative they move more to the right especially along stop especially along
(2:23:08) do you want me to answer the question or not if we're gonna interrupt each other we can do that because you do it and let
(2:23:13) me do it too and we can kind of play that way I thought before you wanted to be respectful if you want to go back to interrupting we can do that you never
(2:23:19) stopped interrupting I did I've been letting you speak the entire time haven't interrupted you you have interrupted me every time I spoke but
(2:23:25) please make your point did I interrupt you right then when you spoke okay in that particular moment no
(2:23:30) you don't all right let's read some supers guys Rick Josie for five bucks says uh the denominations I think we saw
(2:23:38) that one before John diner for 10 bucks says Christ gave his authority to the apostles automatically limits to
(2:23:43) Catholic or Orthodox definitely would stay away from low Protestant churches you get the women pastors and weird New
(2:23:49) Age stuff yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't attend a church that had female pastors it's pretty obviously against um the
(2:23:55) teachings uh Katie note to oneself for five bucks says so love so loving the
(2:24:00) roast the guy in the blue shirt is rightful uh for his own good good to see Common Sense win always great to see
(2:24:06) Common Sense win that's for sure John Dian for five bucks says traditional Latin mass Catholic and Divine Liturgy Orthodox are great they pull many of the
(2:24:13) ceremonies from Old Testament it's awesome I need to check out some more it's say tough when I'm always on the road to be honest guys i' would love to
(2:24:19) get plugged into a church fully and have a church father and all those sorts of things but right now I just can't do
(2:24:25) that which is really unfortunate AB fo for 10 bucks says you should talk to David Patrick Harry about
(2:24:30) the nature of Christian spiritual warfare I actually just followed David Patrick Harry uh yesterday on in on Twitter and he followed me back so
(2:24:36) there's definitely going to be a chat at some point happening there because I've I've really enjoyed watching his debates
(2:24:41) recently um the text vet for 10 bucks says I'll kick The Hornet's Nest the goal is to be a disciple of Christ the
(2:24:48) glob the goal should be to be as Christlike as possible not making money for a pastor bad here in Texas or power
(2:24:56) Catholic Church interesting all right let's uh let's
(2:25:02) carry this on we absolutely killed the Super Chat goals today guys we've killed them twice over we've beaten two of the
(2:25:08) Super Chat goals and the membership goals we've eaten them alive we've got
(2:25:13) so many new members in the chat guys it's really really awesome to see so I appreciate all the support today it's fantastic another one for Katie says Mt
(2:25:22) motto be what you want to be but don't force your ideology on me simple really
(2:25:27) and keep our kids out of it keep our kids out of it indeed I would agree with
(2:25:33) that oh you and before that did I please finish your point okay so here's my
(2:25:38) point my point is that I just showed you and you can find this in Gallup okay women age 18 to 30 are now 30% points
(2:25:45) more liberal than their male contemporaries but but that Gap just
(2:25:50) took six years to open up if you look at this Gap you see as those women get older it drops down to 25 points but for
(2:25:57) men the Gap raises even more exponentially this probably due to marriage you see the same Trend in
(2:26:02) Germany you see the same Trend in the UK you see the same Trend in all Western Nations which means that that Gap closes
(2:26:10) even for women at least by Five Points because they're getting married to men who are conservatives and men are much
(2:26:16) more conservative than women so yes the shift to the right generally does happen young people don't even show up to the
(2:26:22) polls I do expect that that Trend will continue because people have a family which I'm guessing you don't tend to be
(2:26:28) much more conservative like me people who do it is true that married people
(2:26:34) vote Republican I think by a margin of about 10 points does that sound right so that would that would explain the
(2:26:39) compensation fiveo drop off for women unmarried people I think vote for a
(2:26:45) Democrat by an even larger margin I think it's around 15 points I could be wrong about that
(2:26:51) I I I guess what I'm trying to get at is you seem to be holding out hope for the
(2:26:57) future and you seem to be making the case that conventional wisdom will hold and as people get older they will
(2:27:03) inevitably drift to the right because of marriage or this or that I don't see the trends pointing to anything else how do you explain even in you know
(2:27:11) it's interesting even in secular Trends this interrupting each other I thought you just said we should you okay if you
(2:27:17) want fine if you want to go back even SEC even your TR show this how do you explain how do you seriously though how
(2:27:23) do you explain the last probably seven years we we'll take it back to 2018 how do how can you how can you look
(2:27:29) at the political landscape right now and say oh yeah yeah we're doing we're doing great just because these things EV and flow doesn't mean that the pendulum
(2:27:36) won't swing back the trends are in our favor for it to uh swing back it's true
(2:27:42) that there's an EB and flow state in America there is the and when you look at what happened during the Trump
(2:27:49) populism movement that was countercultural right wiers who did that
(2:27:54) and by the way what happened to that movement what happened to that movement it's still going strong Trump's the nominee Trump is the first one-term
(2:28:02) president since George H W bush yeah but I can't get into all the reasons why I think that is and Joe sure we can do
(2:28:08) that and Joe oh because that YouTube okay I can't but here's the thing bro
(2:28:15) and Joe Biden in 2022 got the most poor votes of any president in history
(2:28:20) presided pres no in 2022 he presided over the most
(2:28:27) successful midterm performance for an incumbent party in an entire generation so and in and so there is a there is a
(2:28:36) sustained energy that is happening with not just with leftwing voters but it's energizing new voters the decision the
(2:28:43) do's decision will go down as the worst thing that ha and Trump in my opinion
(2:28:48) will go down as the worst thing that's happened to the Republican party in modern history you mean abortion in
(2:28:54) 2022 inflation was still like high we were still dealing with like 8%
(2:29:00) inflation at that time the economy was struggling people were suffering when
(2:29:05) they went to the was there an event which happened which facilitated that maybe there's a number of events was
(2:29:12) there a specific event you could point to that might have facilitated an economic downturn in the entire country
(2:29:18) a specific globally event we could point to that might explain some of that maybe
(2:29:24) what would that be if you if you if you if you had to wonder brother are you talking about Co right now yes I'm
(2:29:30) saying that the economic downturn under I'm trying to explain why because under the Trump administration of course
(2:29:38) self-evidently true under the Trump Administration
(2:29:43) economic output and optimism was through the roof across all sectors until that
(2:29:48) happened well yeah sure period across all sectors until that happened this is
(2:29:53) my point though but I don't I'm not so sure that your point is the kind of point that goes why is it go ahead go
(2:30:01) ahead why why is it that in 2022 when economic out Outlook was not
(2:30:07) as good as it was in the Trump era pre-co when people were suffering from
(2:30:13) uh inflation higher grocery prices higher gas prices why is it that during a struggling economy I can't get into
(2:30:20) that on YouTube can't get into that on YouTube during during the first get into
(2:30:25) that on YouTube you have to respect the platform bro I'm sorry I can't it's a bit of a it's a bit of a DSX mocking to
(2:30:32) just sit here and just deploy well it's a bit of a we could talk about everything under the [ __ ] son you only want to talk about the one thing
(2:30:37) you can't talk about on YouTube because you want to move past the conv it's good it's good news for me if people like you
(2:30:43) think how do I say this without if people like you think that
(2:30:49) the 2020 in 2022 election weren't exactly on the up and up can I say it like that or you going to get in TR I don't want to get you in trouble I'm
(2:30:54) serious yeah we're not going to talk about that move on it's good for me that you believe
(2:31:00) that because glad think because I think you're overestimating your own popularity and you're underestimating
(2:31:06) the anger that the do's decision provoked thisis badly this undoing row
(2:31:14) and King it back to the States so abortion yes yes so you're going to have a bunch of frothing at the mouth
(2:31:20) ped they to enhance our reproduction crisis by killing their children that's
(2:31:26) how you want that's how you want to phrase but yes I've never seen women fight more than for the right to be
(2:31:32) naked in public and to kill their children than in the United States it's insane but that's fine assuming that
(2:31:38) women who are frothing at the mouth just have to kill their children then actually that's bad news for you and
(2:31:44) good news for me because what you're doing is you're taking your ideology which already is struggling to reproduce
(2:31:50) and making sure that it reproduces even less I don't think it's good for you I don't think it's good for you and I I
(2:31:56) don't know I don't know how many know do do you recognize that there are shortterm how many bad elections would
(2:32:03) you know what a shortterm and guys just to let you know this was some months ago this was like maybe six months ago or
(2:32:09) something like that uh this aged terribly for him because he's talking right now about how it's unpopular to
(2:32:15) conservative positions because of their position on abortion well we just saw
(2:32:20) how unpopular it really is they recognize that decision hurt them elector does matter you're looking at
(2:32:26) short-term versus longterm gains I'm looking at the longest sustained win streak for Democrats like shortterm
(2:32:33) versus long-term gains you know sometimes when you play chess it's okay to let them take the queen if you can
(2:32:38) put them in Checkmate and the truth is all the time Non-Stop and here's here's
(2:32:44) the TR I don't do the rating [ __ ] I get a board out and actually play on a [ __ ] board what's up you want to play
(2:32:50) yeah I'll play in chess but anyway back to this I don't do speed chess though but anyway so back to this yeah happily
(2:32:57) play Play It chess again sometimes there's a good strategy in netting them in we cannot morally compromise on that
(2:33:04) position even if it gives Democrats short-term gains in the long term in the long term it's good for women to have
(2:33:12) children understand the responsibility of those of us who do reproduce those women will tend to become more
(2:33:17) conservative as they age as they tend to do the thing is ultimately you have a
(2:33:23) inside of your head some kind of movement towards this culture of death which is what secularism is for instance
(2:33:30) I'm positive that you can't wait for women to be able to abort their children
(2:33:36) if they want it's a viable form of birth control right I'm uh I'm I would say I'm
(2:33:42) neutral on let me explain in the sense that I'm
(2:33:48) not over here like uh rooting for women to go get an abortion what I would rather see is uh
(2:33:55) increased access to contraception but I don't see it according to my own values
(2:34:01) I don't see a woman getting an abortion as there good or a bad things so I'm not over here like just frothing at the
(2:34:06) mouth for people to get more abortions in fact my understanding is that abortions have gone down in the last two
(2:34:11) decades oh yeah there's less you know what's an interesting point here when you when you have this abortion debate
(2:34:17) with people often times when they they say well you know I don't want people to have like a million abortions a year I
(2:34:23) don't want there to be like two million abortions you just simply ask them why why wouldn't you want that why what's
(2:34:29) wrong with there being 10 million if we could have 10 million abortions a year what would actually be wrong with that
(2:34:34) because I thought it was a good thing and wouldn't it be empowering if 10 million women a year were just making
(2:34:40) these decisions about their about their health care and about their Reproductive Rights wouldn't that be a really good
(2:34:45) thing so if you if these Liberals are saying well you know we'd want to reduce why is that because maybe it's wrong and if
(2:34:52) if you want to have less then there has to be a reason why you want to have less it normally gets them tripped up anyways
(2:34:57) because of things like well people are having less sex but and because of things like expanded access to
(2:35:03) contraception and people are having less sex that's the big one and and and well also expanded access to contraception is
(2:35:10) kind of a big deal um but I'm do you know do you recognize do you recognize
(2:35:16) though that via your harm principle this is actually a bad thing because in order to have all that contraception you have
(2:35:22) to put women on birth control which greatly [ __ ] up their hormones and may account for a lot of the mental illness spikes that we see in women over the
(2:35:29) last oh I don't know 25 years well I'll let them be the the judge of whether or
(2:35:35) not birth how about you give me a position on this do you think that hormonal birth control is good for women
(2:35:41) I think uh contraception is good yeah do you think hormonal birth control is good for women's physiology you think it
(2:35:46) doesn't good on the net yes okay tell me why on the net is it good because it
(2:35:52) gives women the option to uh choose what they want to do with their lives right so basically itev with something instead
(2:35:58) of dealing with something like an unwanted pregnancy it gives people more auton it gives women more autonomy which
(2:36:04) can you think of a way can you think of a way that women could a single way that women could have a guaranteed process of
(2:36:11) not having children is there a way to do that are you talking about getting sterilized or or a man getting
(2:36:18) sterilized what what talking I'm just asking you if there's a guaranteed thing women can do that will make sure they
(2:36:23) never get pregnant don't have sex pretty obvious that sounds viable to me now now
(2:36:29) wait I don't know why you're scoffing women can't not have sex because what have we observed in states that and
(2:36:36) districts and schools that pursue liberal SCH only policy isn't it funny
(2:36:42) how these liberals Ellies have that reaction when you say well maybe we should have less sex maybe we should had
(2:36:47) less sex out of wedlock and guys you know I'm No Angel but I mean it is a
(2:36:53) pretty good argument when you think about avoiding these things like abortions for example they always scuffed it
(2:37:00) like less sex we go be doing that that person Lial schools that that pursue an
(2:37:06) absent only absence only policy what do what do we observe in those schools what do we observe in those schools
(2:37:13) contrasted with students that have access to comprehensive sex ed including teaching them about cont
(2:37:20) what we see is what we see is maternal mortality goes up unwanted teen pregnancy go because it is not a tenable
(2:37:28) position to just expect that people are not gonna have sex then how
(2:37:34) come that's so weird how come there was so few uh of these unwanted pregnancies
(2:37:40) then just 70 years ago if women just can't be expected to not open their [ __ ] legs I'm so confused Hutch why
(2:37:47) we don't we don't live 70 years ago we did I asked you a question I know we don't live 70 years ago so weird to me
(2:37:52) though if your position is women just have to [ __ ] everything they see and get pregnant why is it that 70 years ago
(2:37:59) they weren't doing that Hut I'm saying human sexuality is a predictable phenomena it doesn't matter how many
(2:38:04) times you tell somebody that it's wrong or immoral or this or that you're not answer my question Hutch to me it is
(2:38:09) better to you're not answer my question Hut me is better to recognize I don't give a [ __ ] what you think Hut answer my
(2:38:15) question people [ __ ] are you going to answer my question
(2:38:21) restate the question please okay great and maybe you'll answer it how come 70 years ago how come 70 years ago all
(2:38:26) right just before we do this guys we're going to read out some of these super chats here got a few going on water
(2:38:31) Malone for five bucks says Andrew will be dodged by bigger names for the same reason Jon Jones won't fight Tom aspinal
(2:38:39) it will blemish their legacy Jones won't fight aspel I think you'll have to fight aspinal um but yeah I think that a lot
(2:38:44) of bigger names will because they also think they're above it they've got like this sort of snooty elitist attitude like oh I wouldn't debate like a YouTube
(2:38:52) streamer but also they know they get killed John Don for five bucks says L this argument age poly for Hutch aged
(2:38:58) terribly for Hutch signed gifted 10 memberships where's Ryan with those 50
(2:39:04) memberships he's still he's probably got the police knocking down his door uh Christoper s for 10 bucks says you
(2:39:10) should check out Dr James White at the Alpha and Omega Ministries Channel reformed and Calvinists are Ultra based
(2:39:16) he has shown Catholics to be wrong in debates since the 90s I actually really like Dr James White I like Jeff Durban and those guys at um apia I've watched
(2:39:24) some of their debates they've absolutely kickass with their debates uh and yeah I've seen some of the street street
(2:39:30) stuff they do outside of abortion clinics and everything it's fantastic really entertaining and um I've learned
(2:39:35) a lot from those guys however they won't debate Orthodox if you look into it um
(2:39:40) they won't debate jedah they won't debate the the Orthodox guys they just refuse because they say that they uh
(2:39:46) don't want to don't want to learn about it or so if he was to debate an orthodox if Dr James White was to debate an
(2:39:51) orthodox like J di or something and actually really have it out for a few hours and and get be be more convincing
(2:39:58) then sure i' I'd be all about it but um as far as I'm concerned they won't do that at the
(2:40:03) moment uh Jonathan Dian for 10 bucks says why which is why James White got
(2:40:09) destroyed by Catholic voice of reason in recent debate I haven't seen that I'll have to check that out make sure link
(2:40:15) that to me on Twitter please John all right let's keep going go there were so few of these single mothers in unwanted
(2:40:22) pregnancies in comparison to today because because of the social stigma around bastard CH bastard
(2:40:29) children considered it was considered less socially acceptable and so shotgun weddings were way more common no no no
(2:40:36) no no no no no no no not just shotgun not just shotgun weddings that's [ __ ] you are gonna make the argument
(2:40:42) that this is a that this stigma is a good thing that in that in that let's
(2:40:47) let's say for example a good thing let's say for example two 17year olds have sex
(2:40:54) and then they and then they get pregnant and then due to social stigma they get married and then they then they they
(2:40:59) find out a year two years into the relationship that they're simply not compatible they just do not get along
(2:41:05) sure or maybe there's maybe there's instances of abuse I'm saying it would be better to uh give the give people
(2:41:13) that are going to have sex conception so they don't even have to do have this problem in the first that position makes
(2:41:20) no sense so you're pointing you're pointing to the outliers can you show can you show then that there was all
(2:41:25) these shotgun weddings and domestic abuse was way higher than it is right now I don't know if I can I don't know
(2:41:30) if I can wait I would just assume that shotgun weddings were higher back then are you saying they're not I want the
(2:41:36) evidence that this is true are you incredulous at the idea of that I'm incredulous that you're
(2:41:41) pointing to anything other than outliers I think the stigma largely don't you agree that the stigma is what largely
(2:41:47) kept that under control yeah but and why so hang on stop stop stop stop bro let me follow up let me just follow up
(2:41:53) without you diverting again bro so why isn't that stigma good the stigma is not good because I
(2:42:01) don't think like I guess you and I have different ideas of like what a good outcome is oh no I don't think we do do
(2:42:07) you think that single mothers give better outcomes than two parent households no that's not what we see in the data that's not what we see in the
(2:42:12) data so I guess if we stigmatize single mothers and there's less of them that would be the greatest good wouldn't it Hutch or we could give people contracept
(2:42:19) right yes that has side effects horal birth control has way more side effects
(2:42:25) than social stigma what what could possibly be wrong tell me this what could possibly be wrong if we socially
(2:42:32) stigmatized women to the point that they did not have sex out of turn and get pregnant with unwanted children what in
(2:42:38) the world could possibly be the problem with that other than you think women should go out and [ __ ] a bunch of dudes that they want because they don't want
(2:42:45) that and they don't want that cuz they don't want that you well
(2:42:51) maybe that doesn't matter to you I suppose the children are who matter the children matter I think human beings are
(2:42:59) autonomous and they have an equal right to to dignity oh except unless they're
(2:43:06) in the womb then you'll kill them right H I don't think let me ask you a question are you gonna kill them in the womb Hut they have a lot of dignity then
(2:43:13) tell they're in the you if you had the choice Ryan's back between destroying 10,000 fertilized egg and one fully
(2:43:20) grown baby what would you pick so if you're asking for the consistency measure which is what this is this
(2:43:25) hypothetical yeah this hypothetical is designed to indicate that most people may have a preference over a fully
(2:43:32) formed life rather than an egg but there's a problem with this the same problem as there is with the trolley
(2:43:37) problem and I'll explain it if I problem base but yeah go ahead yeah so let me but let me explain this this the same
(2:43:43) problem with the hypothe know if you were to ask me for instance that word if I would divert on a track where a train
(2:43:50) was heading towards one person or five person towards the the one person versus the five person you and I would probably
(2:43:56) agree we would di to yeah now let me change the hypothetical if you were on
(2:44:02) top of a bridge with your friend and a train was going towards five people would you throw him off the bridge if
(2:44:08) you knew that it would derail the train oh that's tough isn't it though and the
(2:44:14) reason the reason that you change the hypothetical is because you get completely different answers even though it's the same hypothetical it's still
(2:44:21) the choice hang on stop it's still the choice of One Life to five the question here is because people could be ignorant
(2:44:28) right and not understand that there's a formulation of life that they might choose that kid however if we were to
(2:44:34) change it let's say we changed it to this and said okay instead they're they're not eggs they're nine-month-old
(2:44:41) fetuses right versus one child would you save all the 9-month-old fetuses they probably would and then if you work the
(2:44:47) logic back where they agreed that at Inception life began they would change their answer completely that's the
(2:44:53) problem with this hypothetical that would no that would be a tricky situation and so when we're talking about like first of all let me just ask
(2:45:00) you do do you believe that postbirth abortion is a thing what do you mean a thing do you
(2:45:06) like is it is it a thing that's real you guys want to say the T you mean in the United States not that I'm aware of
(2:45:14) okay it is a thing I'm actually surprised to hear you say that um when we talk about uh well I mean by let me
(2:45:21) just clarify the terms you have the baby and then they kill the baby yes this is a buzzword
(2:45:27) that is to my knowledge you don't have the baby and you're allowed to kill the baby to my knowledge okay thank God we don't need to Hash that out it's
(2:45:34) actually it actually is it actually is a thing and it does happen and there are reported cases of it um and this would
(2:45:40) particularly came to prominence during kamala's campaign so I think Andrew probably know about this by now but uh
(2:45:45) botched abortions he maybe he does but botched abortions are real where the baby actually comes out the baby is alive and then the decision is made
(2:45:52) between the mother and the doctor as to what they do with this baby that is alive or if the baby can be resuscitated
(2:45:59) just needs a little bit of of medical attention they'll just let the baby die that's that's a poos birth abortion so
(2:46:06) that actually does happen and there's been cases of it because that's like I'm sure Tim Waltz signed that into law and
(2:46:12) so did DeBlasio you're aware that's like a buzz word that's being thrown around it has been thrown around her uh
(2:46:19) since Ralph Northam yeah but that's because dumbass Liberals are out there saying that they're for it that's why
(2:46:24) the buzzword gets thrown around no what happened on that podcast was Ralph Northam was asked what if uh a mother
(2:46:30) who is uh in the case of a fetus with extreme deformities or is
(2:46:36) nonviable what if she goes into labor before you can perform a procedure and
(2:46:41) he answered in that very specific scenario that they would give birth that
(2:46:47) they would resuscitate the baby if the parents asked them to do that but and until they wanted to make a decision and
(2:46:52) they would just try to keep them comfortable otherwise known as paliative care that got turned into a I don't care
(2:46:58) about any of that it has nothing to do with the position I just stated which is that to my knowledge no well we were
(2:47:04) just clarifying postbirth abortion is not a thing however okay up to up to
(2:47:09) nine months is a thing which is advocated for by the left and that most
(2:47:14) certainly even by your criteria would have to be murder right when we talk about third trimester abortions so let
(2:47:22) me just ask you what what what answer dude I'm so sick of you just answer my question think of the qualifier let me
(2:47:28) just ask you what your let me just ask you the question without answering yours are you for nemon abortion or not dude I
(2:47:35) think the general consensus in the public is that abortions after 25 months
(2:47:41) would be considered bad I don't know I'm asking [ __ ] you I'm I'm generally okay with that kind of restriction what
(2:47:48) I'm talking about is if a woman is carrying a fetus that is
(2:47:53) nonviable and it's in the thir honestly I wonder how it feels to go to
(2:47:59) bed at night and be such a weak flaccid man to be like when when somebody asks
(2:48:05) you a question like is nmon abortion okay and you say oh well generally the societal opinion about it just grow a
(2:48:14) pair of balls and just stand for something brother if we have men like you Society crumbles if we have men like
(2:48:21) you who are just absolutely just pathetic don't stand for anything just a
(2:48:26) preferences and I just want to go to Yos and just look at the view and I want everybody to go to Yos I
(2:48:33) mean women must find this so repulsive guys like this who just have no spine
(2:48:38) who just don't stand for anything these liberal men BET's in the chat guys third
(2:48:44) trimester what do you mean by nonviable cannot survive on their own without uh and this is known this is
(2:48:51) known with 100% certainty yes and and we know for 100% certainty that even if you
(2:48:57) put the fetus on life support it could not go off to leave a normal life yes so the fetus is going to die it could not
(2:49:03) ever lead a life at all yes you're simply descri so nobody nobody nobody gives a [ __ ] about that well the problem
(2:49:11) is is that you're talking about less than 0.5% of all abortions why do we care about those we're talk when we're
(2:49:17) talking about third Master abortions we're talking about less than 1% of abortions the Assumption what did I just
(2:49:23) say bro the assum okay the assumption that I don't know why people like you don't jump to is that the vast vast vast
(2:49:32) vast vast majority of these abortions that are taking place are done because
(2:49:37) the pregnancy poses a risk to the life of the mother I'm just asking you what your standard is are you okay with with
(2:49:44) aborting that fetus in that in that case let's assume for a second that I grant my question bro I am let's assume for a
(2:49:51) second that I'm not that I say go ahead all entropic pregnancies in fact which account for almost none let's just say
(2:49:57) under all of these specific criterias let's just say it was under the circumstance of rape and incest and uh
(2:50:05) one of these pregnancies where the the fetus is completely nonviable I was against all of that they account for almost none of the abortions which are
(2:50:11) done in this country can we speak to those sorry are we talking about
(2:50:17) non-viable fetus now yes that's what I'm speaking to right now yeah great can we talk about no no no listen to what I'm
(2:50:24) asking you well that's why I assuming that I just grant it to you any any of
(2:50:29) the outline cases that you can possibly come up with I say sure we can do abortions under those cases well just
(2:50:34) grant it for the sake of argument well I can you tell me can you tell me what the
(2:50:41) [ __ ] that has to do with aborting a fetus at the N9 month 8mth seven month six month which is viable because my
(2:50:50) understanding is that this is not really a thing man my understanding is that if you are aborting a fetus when it's like
(2:50:56) one week before the projected delivery date that there's something going on
(2:51:02) that is impacting the health or life of the mother you guys seem to think that
(2:51:08) it's like a standard thing for a woman to carry a fetus all the way up to I say religious
(2:51:15) conservatives that are like vehemently yeah why don't you associate positions with me fine I won't generalize I I'll speak
(2:51:22) to you m so I just granted I just granted all that sure sure assuming that
(2:51:27) the fetus is viable at 9 months eight months seven months abing it murder I'd have to give any to do it I think that
(2:51:34) there are reasonable arguments against something like that that's not my [ __ ] question answer my question ever
(2:51:42) is it murder or not accept a question like that do you understand what I'm saying no I don't say yes or say
(2:51:49) just because I don't phrase it exactly the way that you want me to phrase it yes you won't answer anything I'm trying
(2:51:56) to meet you where you are bro I'm trying to find some then meet me where I'm at here's what I want answer my questions and I'll answer yours like I have been
(2:52:02) doing at Nine Months 8 months seven months if mommy says I don't want it and
(2:52:08) you abort it is it murder or not the idea of a woman doing something
(2:52:14) like that at that point in her pregnancy is not something that that I would
(2:52:20) personally feel comfortable with the question is is it murder or not if you
(2:52:26) want to use that word I I I don't know I'd have to think about it man you don't know if it's murder or not I would have
(2:52:32) to think about that you would have to think it nine months if it was murder yeah I mean so it's the day before
(2:52:37) mommy's about to give birth to this perfectly viable fetus you would need to think if it's murder I don't think this
(2:52:43) is a thing that has happen guys if anybody's in the chat that actually has a genuine question mark about about
(2:52:49) these sort of uh I mean I'm as prif as you can possibly get but when you think when you look at these late late term
(2:52:55) abortions go and follow live action which is L La Rose's organization on um Twitter and just look at the videos and
(2:53:01) photos that they post and that they post of what these babies look like after
(2:53:07) they've been it's it's just shocking and if you can look at that and say it's not murdered then um you'd have to have a
(2:53:12) few screws loose happening is my point it's a red herring assuming it's not
(2:53:18) happening I'll just assume it's never happened in the history of mankind is it murder or
(2:53:23) not it's a difficult question it's one i' to about don't think brother it is
(2:53:30) [ __ ] you're so dumb it's actually hard for me to have this conversation with you brother it's a totally reasonable
(2:53:36) thing for somebody to say you know what let me think about that the day before it's going to be born she says go in and
(2:53:42) abort it that's that's that's a hard decision for Hut to make if you I don't know going at like 8 months and 29 days
(2:53:51) just [ __ ] pokea feetus with a with a scalpel it's it's hard not to consider that murder so so I'm trying absolute
(2:53:58) [ __ ] it's hard not to come to that conclusion something I have to think about
(2:54:03) it sure yeah you're gonna have to think about it so let me ask you this you're with your wife you're with your wife
(2:54:10) hang on you're with your wife you're with your wife no it's testing your logic bro it's just testing your logic so if you're with your wife you want to
(2:54:16) get hung up on logic all right guys quickly we got one on Super Chat here uh I'm not your buddy
(2:54:23) guy for five bucks I was just joining the stream but I wanted to say I truly appreciate how you and Tim Paul give a spotlight to Andrew Wilson he's a truly
(2:54:29) great thought leader does not need my Spotlight guys he gets like sometimes up to 10,000 and More in his chats so he's
(2:54:36) got a uh much larger and uh like audience than than I do really so he
(2:54:42) doesn't need me but I'm happy to put to use his content and he's gracious like that so yeah yeah I know by the way guys
(2:54:49) we're still accepting um super chats and we're still accepting Channel memberships so uh yeah oh stupid me with
(2:54:56) my logic my dumb logic because you want to focus on thought experiments instead of dealing in the world because if your
(2:55:01) thoughts are inconsistent so are your policies so going back to this you're with your wife you [ __ ] your wife you're
(2:55:09) okay guys this needs to be addressed Lans Noir for two bucks here how to convince A girlfriend of pro-life just
(2:55:14) dump my ex you really can't guys unfortunately uh it sounds like she's
(2:55:19) pretty indoctrinated in terms of the whole pro-choice position but these days
(2:55:25) I'm pretty just if there's a if I if I've got a girl who I want to date who's
(2:55:30) Pro abortion that's like the sort of um the lower end of of of of what you'd
(2:55:36) expect a girl's morality to be to to to have a woman who you want to have your children one day and to be your wife I
(2:55:43) think we can start from a basis of at least you don't want to kill kids okay at least you don't want to kill your
(2:55:48) kids that's like the very low end of it if you want to kill your kids then I'm unfortunately that's a little bit too
(2:55:54) much of a red flag for me to handle okay so if you got a pro-choice girlfriend
(2:56:00) that's a really big red flag really big red flag these days I I want dat girl unless they are based really based it's
(2:56:07) not like I have to hear their sort of like pattle and I have to hear all of their concerns about everything I'm
(2:56:14) concerned about this I'm concerned about no it's you're the man I'm the woman you're going to lead I'm going to going
(2:56:19) to listen and I'm not going to give you a headache that's what you want to sort
(2:56:24) of be looking for a woman who understands the role of a man and empowers him to do that and just
(2:56:29) respects him and enables him to do that you don't want to hear about all their concerns you don't want to hear have to untangle all of their liberal feminist
(2:56:36) [ __ ] because all their friends will just reins it and then it won't go well for you okay you don't want to be
(2:56:43) dealing with all that sort of stuff it's just too much if you're a busy guy especially you don't want to be dealing with that crap okay and also you don't
(2:56:49) want this milk toast conservatism you don't want to be dealing with milk toast conservative takes okay this sort of
(2:56:56) like things that You' no offense to Turning Point USA but the stuff you'd hear at the sort of Turning Point USA
(2:57:01) conferences about like you know you know what I mean guys just milk toast conservatism okay you want to be the
(2:57:08) ones instilling the values let's carry on you're going to have a baby yay you
(2:57:15) have a big celebration you have your stupid pink hair gender review party you do the whole nine yards okay and then at
(2:57:21) nine months nine months she goes and she she decides even without your consent
(2:57:29) because it's her body to go and have the fetus terminated two days before she's
(2:57:34) slated to give birth to it did she murder your child or not yeah even from
(2:57:40) a pro even from a pro-choice perspective that's something to me that's like difficult to stomach it's just something
(2:57:46) I would have to like think about okay and I don't think there's anything wrong with just like like or no did she kill
(2:57:53) your child or didn't is my mic on is my mic on yeah it's on so I know you can hear me bro a what a gay response you
(2:58:01) you need to think about if if she murdered your kid or not sure I will great I'll get back now let's assume for a second a guy walked over to her she
(2:58:07) wanted to have that kid and he stabbed her in the stomach and she survived but the fetus didn't should he go to jail
(2:58:13) for murder I I listen bro the the thought experiments you want to FOC focus on I think are largely done to
(2:58:21) distract from the actual point which is that women that are getting abortions at that per point in their pregnancy are
(2:58:28) doing so because it opposes some kind of risk to them and what we're seeing right now and I don't know how you could
(2:58:34) defend this I just granted all those risks as being true I just granted the entire thing for you let let me speak
(2:58:40) okay and tell me if tell me if you um Johnny U says it's not
(2:58:45) pro-abortion it's pro- Choice well if it's not pro-abortion and then what is it because what's happening in that
(2:58:52) procedure okay are they planting flowers are they planting trees are they getting
(2:58:57) an ice cream from the local ice no it's an abortion so that's what it is be pro-abortion and the majority of people
(2:59:03) don't want to have an abortion not an argument just because they don't want to doesn't mean that it's wrong they just want to tell people to have a choice if
(2:59:10) something is wrong with the pregnancy no it's not that's not what the that's not what the pro abor abortion and
(2:59:16) pro-choice argument is that's not what is if something's wrong with it they want to do it whenever they want and use it as birth control that's
(2:59:23) obvious so really just an indefensible position I don't know why people come up with these stupid tags if you agree with
(2:59:30) the 24 states that are either currently implementing or will Implement shortly a
(2:59:35) essential ban on abortion now the thing is it's like in every single one of these states as far as I understand
(2:59:41) there are uh exceptions for the life of the mother I don't know of a single state that doesn't have exceptions for
(2:59:46) the life of the mother the difficult thing to navigate when you implement a policy like that is that it's it is
(2:59:53) often times impossible to accurately assess risk and so what is happening in
(3:00:00) state after state after state is Physicians are gunshi to perform the procedure because they don't want the
(3:00:06) sheriff showing up and arresting them and barring them from practicing medicine and so what's happening is they
(3:00:12) literally have to wait until a woman goes into sepsis before they perform this procedure a lot of these women are
(3:00:20) are it's it is now made them infertile because they could not access this
(3:00:25) procedure that we are discussing right now do you think that that is a good
(3:00:31) policy uh if we're going from your logic I would say it has to be so let me explain why I'm asking you can we not
(3:00:38) I'm giving it to you I'm telling you I'm I'm explaining to you why asking opion
(3:00:45) yes because because if the if the condition is you secularist cannot determine when life even begins nor when
(3:00:52) it becomes murder to terminate it then I'm going to air on the side of caution and say it's always
(3:00:58) murder okay to be clear I I to be clear you favor a policy of there's a
(3:01:05) physician a mother comes in she's she's uh there's some complications going on
(3:01:10) they do an ultrasound and and they find some kind of defect but it doesn't necessarily immediately pose a threat to
(3:01:18) the mother's life and then they have to wait until the woman goes into sepsis before they perform that procedure and
(3:01:26) then the woman becomes infertile how often does this happen you're saying that this is an acceptable outcome now
(3:01:32) we're now we're appealing to how many times how many times do third trimester abortions happen if that's the standard
(3:01:38) well so even if I were to say that none no third trimester abortion has ever
(3:01:43) happened in the history of mankind if you cannot make the determination whether it's murder or not to have one
(3:01:49) at 9 months then having the conversation of consideration for what happens to a
(3:01:55) life if you and I have different criteria for it doesn't even make sense is it murder to terminate the pregnancy
(3:02:00) if it is a nonviable fetus if depending on how you mean nonviable we've already established that
(3:02:07) a moment ago bro if it's a threat to the life of the mother
(3:02:12) no you think a woman should be forced to carry to term even if it represents a threat to her own life I just said no I
(3:02:19) just said no do you know what the word no means it's the opposite of yes see how easy it is to say yes or no so we're
(3:02:25) making progress now now that I just answered with yes or no can you answer yes or no to my question now if a man
(3:02:32) went over to your wife at N9 months pregnant and stabbed her in the stomach and it killed your unborn child who was
(3:02:38) due the next day did he just murder your unborn child sure let's say it's murder
(3:02:44) why is it murder let's say it's murder yes is it though I think you're splitting hairs yes or
(3:02:51) no let's say yes no say yes or no like I just did to you yes it is okay thank you
(3:02:58) yes thank you so then it would be murder if she went and aborted it but this is something so then hang on so then it
(3:03:04) would be murder if she went and aborted it also the day before her due date without telling you right this is
(3:03:10) something that we have already sort of litigated as a society it is my
(3:03:16) understanding that over concerning roie Wade was broadly unpopular it is one of the most unpopular Supreme Court
(3:03:23) decision isn't it wild that that is legal is that wild that that's legal in
(3:03:30) some states a woman can kill a guy's baby if she just say in a hypothetical
(3:03:36) she caught him cheating on her and she was so angry and just so vengeful and she just had she was the just a woman of
(3:03:42) terrible character and she knew how much he was looking forward to having this kid how much he he wanted to have this kid she could go kill his baby a few
(3:03:49) days before it's due and then just hypothetically if she wanted to just get back at him and that's completely legal
(3:03:54) that is wild absolutely wild um all right let's
(3:04:00) read out some super chats John Riley says here to support Trump's homeless policy from the Tik Tok Invasion last
(3:04:05) night was absolutely classic one rattlesnake TV membership for Fredo appreciate that John D for five buck
(3:04:11) says if she sees her future children as Expendable she sees you as Expendable absolutely 100% true true Lans Noir says
(3:04:19) she's modest basically a virgin Catholic raised logged off all social love science love science bit of a red flag
(3:04:24) there joking um but 100% pro-choice had to gently let her go yeah I would gently
(3:04:30) let her go and run the other way if she 100% for killing like you don't want to
(3:04:37) be someone to be the mother of your children who is 100% in favor of killing said children okay okay Lans I'm glad you let her go
(3:04:45) glad you let her go uh W Watson ripped rich and rare says Jake until when you will continue to S
(3:04:53) Andrew Wilson's D bro uh Wes Watson jump jump in the live brother let's let's
(3:04:59) let's hear it BGN five bucks what it even is BGN someone give me that um what is that
(3:05:05) currency but wouldn't it be funny guys if it actually was where Watson we could get him in the
(3:05:10) live Ryan gives 50 rattlesnake TV memberships the man the myth the legend
(3:05:17) he's been through fraud today he got his card unlocked and 50 people are going to be rattlesnake TV memberships members
(3:05:23) now W's in the chat for Ryan guys W Ryan in the chat much appreciated Rick Josie
(3:05:28) for two bucks says when does viability end birth one year 18
(3:05:34) years zet zimo for five bucks says first time catching you live Jake love seeing
(3:05:39) you come into Tik Tok invasions keep bringing us the 10 out of 10 content appreciate that we'll get our own Tik Tok invasions happening very soon
(3:05:45) decisions that's come out of the court in a really long W there are there are
(3:05:50) um conditions that people have in terms of their support for abortion and my
(3:05:56) understanding it's like you probably know the percentages better than I do but it's something like 60 to 65% of the
(3:06:04) the country is not comfortable with with abortion past a certain point I don't know if that number is 24 months or 25
(3:06:10) months it's it's something in that area okay what the there's a very real
(3:06:15) consequence going on right now of these 24 States these red states that
(3:06:22) have pursued this policy of abortion banss where they have been too vague in
(3:06:27) their language about representing the threat of the threat to the life of the mother they don't bother to go into
(3:06:34) specifics and so Physicians are holding off and it's and it's impacting women
(3:06:40) yeah I don't know how many times it happens if that happened 100 times or a thousand times or 10,000 times that to
(3:06:46) me is a horror ing Prospect a mother see some emojis in the chat guys all the members L of new
(3:06:53) members we're talking when we're talking about sepsis we're talking about a risk to her ability to be fertile in the
(3:06:59) future so can I can I just get you to say you would support reform in being
(3:07:04) more specific about what represents a life to the mother so that Physicians I can't I
(3:07:10) can't make that claim and here's why you think that to just
(3:07:16) go you can jum on can't tell me when the viability of a life begins because you can't tell me when the viability of the
(3:07:22) life begins you can't tell me when it's a life you can't tell me when it's not you can't even give me a moral imperative for why I should value it if
(3:07:28) it was or it wasn't out of your [ __ ] preferences why should I adhere why should I adhere to any policy
(3:07:35) prescription that you offer up instead of trying to air the most I possibly can on the side of human life that you can't
(3:07:42) even Define so this is where I was trying to sort of gauge what you believe
(3:07:47) in terms of like when you believe this this life begins and human life begins an Inception the science is settled you
(3:07:53) believe that when we talk about life like I I believe there's other factors to consider as well like Consciousness
(3:08:00) oh Consciousness what's that Consciousness is the experience we have
(3:08:05) of understanding the world that we live in and who we are and it's not wrong to harm somebody who's not conscious is
(3:08:12) this what you're going to do like um you're you're deferring to like euthanasia stuff right this is standard
(3:08:18) for life why would you get mad at me for questioning it listen I really don't want to get bogged down on this oh you
(3:08:23) really don't want to get bogg down how many times in one debate is he going to bring something up real get like
(3:08:29) literally instantly destroyed whatever he says and then go oh I don't want to get bogged down and start criticizing
(3:08:34) Andrew for um giving actually discussing what he brought up it's the most pathetic performance your positions I
(3:08:40) know no because we just just turns into this [ __ ] debate bro insufferable [ __ ] it's not debate rowing it's looking
(3:08:46) at your it is so how can you how can you have a conversation where I disagree with you
(3:08:53) and you disagree with me if we're not debating because I because I asked you a question earlier about 10,000 fertilized
(3:08:59) eggs versus gave you the answer no you I would grab all the eggs because I
(3:09:04) understand what they are they're human life that's not an answer to my question bro that's not I would grab the eggs is
(3:09:11) not the answer I could never imagine a more specific answer than that Hutch no no no
(3:09:17) to be clear so what you're saying is you would save the 10,000 eggs and let the fully grown and why baby die yeah
(3:09:24) they're fertilized eggs it's human life what's the problem with that can you tell me why that's immoral because I don't think you'd actually do that in
(3:09:29) the real world why why would it be an immoral choice this ridiculous hypothetical you wouldn't I don't think
(3:09:36) you would grab the the eggs I really don't I don't think you would push the kid I don't think you would push your friend in theart problem what's your
(3:09:42) point because you both because you and I both know that there is a difference between a fetus and a baby what is it
(3:09:49) there's a the a a fetus is a developing small human being it starts
(3:09:55) as a small so it's a human being Clump clump of cells sure I mean it's the beginnings of a human being yeah what
(3:10:02) makes it not a human being I just said it's the beginnings of a human being yeah what makes it not a
(3:10:07) human being what's the thing you can point to that makes that not a human are we like do I need to explain like the
(3:10:13) concept of gestation is that where we're at explain the concept human life begins my take is my my personal take is
(3:10:22) that I draw a distinction between a fetus and a baby you don't that's fine why am I wrong you say I don't want I
(3:10:28) don't I don't care you don't care why I'm wrong because we simply disagree and we're not gonna We're Not Gonna agree on
(3:10:33) this oh so then we should never we should never debate it out because we disagree that's the smart Hut we can
(3:10:39) have a we can have a debate but I I would want it to be like good faith and when you tell me you would grab 10,000 fertilized eggs over a baby I simply
(3:10:45) don't believe and when you tell me you your friend off in order to stop the train in order to deflect him even though you're a utilitarian even though
(3:10:52) you're a utilitarian that means you're bad faith Hutch no I I told you that would be a no
(3:10:59) I didn't even give you an answer to that question I told you oh that's tough yeah exactly you didn't you don't answer any questions unless I beat them out of you
(3:11:05) you won't do it it's and you know why you know why
(3:11:10) you can't answer yes or no like I've done for you so many times I have to I have to beat every answer out do you
(3:11:16) know why I have to you know why I have to it's because are so [ __ ] ashamed of your
(3:11:22) positions that you're terrified you're going to give me one and I'm gonna rip it apart in front of the world and
(3:11:28) you're not gonna know what to do with yourself exactly what's happening right now listen to me I've been doing like online stuff for like 15 years well you
(3:11:33) suck at it this this stuff my chat would probably agree my this stuff doesn't
(3:11:40) really I I would imagine that this stuff doesn't get me nearly as fired up as as
(3:11:45) it does for you that dopamine Rush of like the attention and all that stuff it
(3:11:50) just doesn't it doesn't impct me the same way so I'm not looking for the same thing that you are in what are you
(3:11:55) looking for I think it's interesting to have conversations with people that you deeply disagree with I first I don't
(3:12:03) give the first flying [ __ ] about like this Blood Sport [ __ ] bro talk like a
(3:12:09) normal human being I'm talk was this is the most normal I can talk to a person I
(3:12:14) would talk to a boy like this who had stupid Asin positions I do it all the time inside of my Discord if somebody's
(3:12:21) being stupid I point it out to them and you know why I do that it's good for you it's good for you to learn how dumb your
(3:12:27) positions are it's good for you you you point it out because it gives you a dopamine rush because you like the
(3:12:32) attention that you get and you like the appear oh so why do you stream is it for a dopamine rush we both do it sure but
(3:12:38) I'm just saying you should at least you're a hypocrite so you're a hypocrite no like are you leading with like
(3:12:44) Christ's levels let's get off here let's get off let's move back to this twet let move
(3:12:51) back to this tweet thing where you're talking about with Min gains and hypocrisy Let's uh let's let's figure this thing
(3:12:57) out I would love to because it seems like calm down like it's it's calm down like a little bit the question that I
(3:13:04) wanted to ask you before was how do you when you're deciding because clearly you
(3:13:09) have a goal and I think I've heard you in previous videos discuss that your goal is to be subversive so you want you
(3:13:16) want to slow that oh I mean I could be wrong but you
(3:13:21) tell me I believe that you outlined a sort of broad goal and it kind of reminds me of like Christopher rufo a little bit of
(3:13:27) like you want to slowly infiltrate maybe institutions yeah that's true yes and
(3:13:34) and and sort of plant the seeds of your of your thing and so so so to clarify the position you say that leftists have
(3:13:41) subverted institutions and the right can do the same thing when I use subversion now this is where it gets very
(3:13:47) interesting in terms of our political Theory here guys because we're talking about subversion with like we said we
(3:13:52) don't want to subvert any institutions and make them based completely right wing I don't want to do that I'd never
(3:13:58) want I'd never want to do that exactly what the left wing has done but do it for the right I would never want to do
(3:14:03) that um but uh it's interesting because when you get uh these sort of milk toast
(3:14:11) conservative texes which is like we can all just sort of stand in the middle and we can we can talk it out uh I think it
(3:14:16) was actually Andrew who once said to me if a conservative a liberal and a Libertarian are all standing in a room
(3:14:22) together the libertarian and the conservative will look at each other they'll shake hands and they will say sorry sorry if they're standing in a
(3:14:28) room and there's a sword right the libertarian conservatives will look at each other and they'll shake hands and they'll say all right we're not going to use the sword and by the time they turn
(3:14:35) around the liberal would have already picked up the sword and stabbed them in the back okay I think that's actually
(3:14:40) very true and we've seen this play out in the culture the conservatives want to have the dialogue the conversations because they have the stronger ideas
(3:14:47) the Liberals they want to go underground and they want to subvert everything and they want to subvert the truth but what
(3:14:53) would be wrong with the conservatives doing the exact same thing not necessarily underground but just subverting the institutions a little bit
(3:14:59) and just giving based right-wing propaganda and using some more power play what would actually be wrong with
(3:15:05) that because we would be some doing some truth propaganda we'd be doing propaganda about the truth and fighting
(3:15:11) against their ideology and this is why where I find this political ideology and this political philosophy from
(3:15:16) conservatives very interesting and compelling which is what are we going to do moving forward are we going to sit
(3:15:21) there and just sort of have this nice conversation oh we've got the we've got the best trans people on our side we've got the good trans people the bass trans
(3:15:28) people and meanwhile while we're having this conversation they're just borrowing underground and just freaking grabbing
(3:15:34) the kids and just reading them [ __ ] books is that what we're going to do or are we going to use a little bit of
(3:15:41) power because power is at the end of the day the essence of politics what are we going to do anyways let's continue I'm
(3:15:49) using it tongue and cheek as a weapon back against the left do you understand
(3:15:56) okay sure I'm glad you clarified it but I I was right when you said subversive but yeah but absent context you're not
(3:16:03) right because you take it out of context it means something else I feel like it means the same thing
(3:16:08) if you're talking about like in infiltrating it'sing fun of leftist that's why I'm saying that so you don't
(3:16:14) want to infiltrate institu institutions infiltration it would just be us taking them back over exactly it wouldn't be
(3:16:21) the same sort of infiltration from the left the left actually did this via legislation and law and what they did
(3:16:28) was unconscionable honestly through communism that's how they were able to do it when [ __ ] communist came over
(3:16:34) here but that's neither here nor there I feel like you you split hairs a bit I don't feel like it's Hair S splitting I
(3:16:39) feel like we should be accurate I literally just quoted I just I mean a literally I wasn't trying to take you out of context I was not TR which is why
(3:16:45) I gave it context okay fine perfect let's move past that yeah so the my G stuff right but the mying gain stuff is
(3:16:52) not it's not I'm not I wasn't meant to hyper fixate on this particular thing I wanted to talk about a more broad
(3:16:58) General discussion about how you like what is your process when determining
(3:17:05) because clearly if you have this goal of of of of uh taking over culture we'll say clearly if you have this goal like I
(3:17:12) assume there's a strategy right like I assume you game this out and you think like this topic might more Salient or
(3:17:17) this topic might be less popular so I don't want to waste my time doing that kind of thing how do you determine what
(3:17:23) thing that you focus on because I noticed you focus a lot on like sex workers I noticed you focus a lot
(3:17:29) on sexual degeneracy why do you prioritize these
(3:17:34) things over say something like hypocrisy when we know that Jesus my and this is
(3:17:40) my loose understanding you can tell me you're more familiar with with scripture Jesus loaded hypocrisy more than
(3:17:45) anything no Jesus didn't loathe hypocrisy more than anything that's just an assertion my understanding that's
(3:17:51) yeah it's just an assertion he's talk he talked I have so many other Bible versus here I mean are you denying that he did
(3:17:56) not like he really didn't like hypocrisy that wasn't what your claim was what was your claim did Jesus really not like
(3:18:04) hypocrisy let's just change it to that then all right yes but the contextualization was he was talking about religious Hypocrites okay m not
(3:18:12) somebody who says I smoke and you shouldn't smoke like if I go to my daughter and I tell her just be honest
(3:18:18) with me now if I go to my daughter and I say Daddy smokes and I'm always going to smoke don't smoke I am being a hypocrite
(3:18:27) right um that's I don't know that's difficult I mean I think it was probably you'd probably be easier to make the
(3:18:32) case that you would be like an idiot for doing something that was like harming you why would it not be hypocrisy by your stand because you're
(3:18:38) not because you're not encouraging somebody else to do it so like you can you can have something so you can have
(3:18:44) something hold on listen listen you can have something like an addiction and not wish that Addiction on somebody else you
(3:18:50) don't smoke nicotine or you don't smoke cigarettes because necessarily maybe you like the the act of smoking but you
(3:18:56) smoke cigarettes because you're addicted to nicotine so it's not it's not necessarily hypocritical to suggest that
(3:19:02) somebody else doesn't start so then what is a hypocrite a hypocrite is somebody who does not live by the values that
(3:19:09) they espouse so if I tell somebody that I have a value and then I do not live by
(3:19:15) that value and the value is smoking and I tell you not to smoke would I be a hypocrite I think there are Shades of
(3:19:23) Gray I okay so then that's not what a HP so then what is a hypocrite more it's it's more difficult in that position to
(3:19:29) assign you the label of hypocrisy because you are not you you are doing it
(3:19:35) out of like care for your daughter well I just want to let you know that earlier in this conversation when I brought up
(3:19:40) the exact same example you said it would be hypocritical now you're changing your tune and the reason that you're all
(3:19:47) and the reason that you're doing that the reason that you're changing your tune on this is because you now understand brought up you were the one
(3:19:53) try to explain to you why this is the you were the one that brought up addicts if I recall correctly yeah because now
(3:19:59) you're strawmanning the absolute [ __ ] out no I'm not yes you are very conscientious not to do that to people
(3:20:04) is it hypocrit is it okay well you're not doing a great job because you asked me is it hypocritical for a for a
(3:20:09) recovered alcoholic to tell somebody that they shouldn't drink and I said no
(3:20:15) I never said whatever your alleging that I said here if you want to find try to find that you can let us assume for a
(3:20:21) second then we'll be hyp specific and say a guy is cheating on his wife and he
(3:20:29) espouses you should not cheat on your wife is he a
(3:20:35) hypocrite um yeah yeah he's a hyp okay great now
(3:20:40) we know what a hypocrite is now if he tells you not to cheat on your wife even though he's cheating on his wife
(3:20:47) is his hypoc stop stop let me finish the question hold there's a caveat [ __ ]
(3:20:52) guy dude no there is because if if you tell someone uh I am cheating on my wife
(3:20:59) but it's making me miserable and it's not making my life better which is why I think that you shouldn't cheat on your
(3:21:05) wife that's more difficult to call hypocrisy because you're not espousing one thing and then acting a different
(3:21:12) way necessarily in the same way so then if if so then by this logic grant that if that's true sure I'll just grant it
(3:21:19) if that is true then if myON and fresh say you should absolutely not come into
(3:21:27) come in the uh vagina of an uh you know an Asian National and get her pregnant
(3:21:33) that's a really not a good idea to do and it's making my life miserable they wouldn't be [ __ ] Hypocrites would
(3:21:39) they dummy definitely don't do that guys no answer my question answer the
(3:21:44) question terrible idea I've been trying to tell you can't answer question you want to make this all about my R I'm talking about a
(3:21:51) bigger concept it's oh my I'm talking about the concept of hypocrisy is now the third time that I've tried to ask
(3:21:57) you how do you come to the what is the calculus intern what is the internal calculus for how you determine you know
(3:22:04) what I'm gonna spend 80% of my time going after sex workers and trans people
(3:22:09) and I'm not really going to spend like any time going after hypocrisy when we know that Jesus [ __ ] I'm going after
(3:22:14) hypocrisy right this second there's no possible way I could be going after hypocrisy more than I am right
(3:22:20) this second where we're defining hypocrisy and we can determine what a hypocrite is or it is not so that we can
(3:22:26) make the no I'm not that is your point yes you are okay give me your point again do you spend a good deal of your
(3:22:33) time focused on what you would call sexual degeneracy yes why do you make
(3:22:39) the decision you can say it's because of preference but I'm asking you for specifics why do you make the decision
(3:22:44) to focus on what you call sexual degener y over idolatry over lying over uh uh
(3:22:52) saying the lord's name in vain over hypocrisy do you know that Paul relayed that sexual sin is one of the worst
(3:22:59) types of sin because it is a sin against yourself it is a sin against your own flesh he outlined it as being a worse
(3:23:06) sin than other types of sin because it is something which people always seem to
(3:23:12) fall into the Trap of continuing to do other sins are not necessarily equ this
(3:23:17) way and degeneracy has a much larger effect on society than other forms of
(3:23:22) sin seem to at least from the perspective that I can see now hang on let me finish okay all right you're
(3:23:27) asking me things like why would you go after this more than you would hypocrisy I go after all of it all of it together
(3:23:34) non-stop it's just that the degeneracy is right in your face and something we can see that's easy to point to and say
(3:23:40) wait a second wait a second no this is [ __ ] you should not be engaging in
(3:23:46) these Act activities and usually I use secular non-religious arguments unless somebody's trying to use a religious
(3:23:52) argument against me now that all said moving it back to hypocrisy can you
(3:23:59) please answer this question for me now that I just answered all of yours by your criteria then if myin gains and
(3:24:06) fresh say I'm miserable this sucks you should absolutely never come in a Chinese National it's awful right it was
(3:24:14) the worst decision I ever made they're not Hypocrites right I was more
(3:24:19) addressing you're answer the [ __ ] question bro come on it seemed like it seemed like you answer it answer the
(3:24:27) question now this guy is [ __ ] horrible he will just not answer the
(3:24:32) question um all right John Donan for five bucks says this dude says I feel
(3:24:37) like I'm arguing with my dad it actually looks like that though it does look like he's arguing with his dad um lord of the
(3:24:45) neres for five bucks says hut and B at all engage in subex subtextual
(3:24:50) psychoanalytic posturing because it deals with conjectured sub subtextual reads that are non fals
(3:24:57) viable okay continuing on now please it seemed like you were running defense for
(3:25:02) them it seems like you won't answer my question when you were undermining uh
(3:25:08) criticism of them for their hypocrisy are you ever going to how do we know they're Hypocrites by your criteria
(3:25:13) they're not no I'm talking about I'm I'm talking about well no that that's besides the
(3:25:19) point you no it's not besides the point how could I not go after them for hypocrisy that doesn't exist you said
(3:25:24) the laziest form of argumentation is the appeal to hypocrisy that's correct and I'm and I'm asking how you square that with Jesus's incredible levels of disain
(3:25:32) when it came to the concept of hypocrisy because in the form of the religious it
(3:25:38) matters because you could be giving false Doctrine if you're a hypocrite however that's a hyp specific example of
(3:25:44) what is always true true Doctrine is always true so any form of hypocrisy is
(3:25:50) terrible in that context when you're making an argument though for a person's Behavior based on the results and that's
(3:25:58) what they're doing the results of X is you're a hypocrite okay but even if you
(3:26:03) are a hypocrite that does not mean that the argument which you are making is in any way attacking the position that this
(3:26:09) person has that's why it's facius in this case moving back I'm going to ask you this for a third time
(3:26:16) by your criteria if myON gains and fresh both say this is making my life
(3:26:22) miserable and you should not engage in it even though I did the thing they are not Hypocrites yes or no yeah according
(3:26:28) to what I said before yeah yes so they're not Hypocrites to be honest with you brother I don't I don't watch a lot of fresh and
(3:26:34) fit so then if they're not Hypocrites why would I be going after them for hypocrisy to begin with I would I was
(3:26:40) but because it was not that you were necessarily defending on them of the merits of the accusation you were attacking the very idea of going after
(3:26:48) them for hypocrisy yeah it's a it's a very bad way to argue but if but if you want to if you want to make the case
(3:26:54) that like there's hypocrisy in a religious context and that's what you reserve your uh your your um energy for
(3:27:02) then then then that's one thing but if we're talking about sexual degeneracy do
(3:27:08) you agree that someone like Donald Trump sets a a pretty bad example for young
(3:27:13) men are you saying he's a hypocrite I'm saying he's by your own standards look all these slimy little gutes what is a
(3:27:21) sexual my standard well I suppose I was guessing
(3:27:27) but I think anything that you would consider to be degenerate would be something that would uh erode your
(3:27:35) perception of proper good societal Norms is that accurate a degenerate is a cumer
(3:27:42) and a cumer is one who is practicing in the practice of cuming okay so a person who was a degenerate a
(3:27:50) sexual deviant something like this or a cummer my whole chat's a bunch of recovering cumers you're talking to a
(3:27:56) cumer bro I used to [ __ ] all the time I was a cumer love banging lots of BR
(3:28:02) thought it was great okay does that make me a hypocrite no I don't think it does no I
(3:28:08) don't think it does either but I don't think the thing is is that if you're a non-practicing cumer and you go are
(3:28:16) practicing the and you make fun of them and you say look this is stupid doesn't bring you anything of material value or
(3:28:23) non-material value even ultimately this is something which will destroy uh your
(3:28:28) life it's something where you can you know it'll it'll put you in a massive Pitfall right and it's something that is
(3:28:35) tangible and we can see a zillion examples of don't C don't C in your early 20s don't C in your 30s don't C in
(3:28:42) your 40s don't C when you have a midlife crisis you're talking about repentance and the signif significance of
(3:28:48) repentance if somebody if somebody repents then then that what scripture teaches us is that we should forgive them right right so you're you're
(3:28:55) applying the standard to to Donald Trump and the problem with that is what
(3:29:01) the problem with that is that do you and maybe you do but like it's just
(3:29:07) difficult for me to understand do do you believe that Donald Trump has gotten down on his hands and knees and ask Jesus Christ for forgiveness for
(3:29:13) cheating on Melania when she was pregnant with you nalah has I don't know who the [ __ ] Nala is bro
(3:29:19) Nala is a prostitute who's all over the news right now including on Twitter who recently made the conversion why don't
(3:29:25) you look her up real quick she was an only fans prostitute who I did a debate with she went on to claim that she had
(3:29:32) reformed and got on her knees and had repented
(3:29:38) Ina uh I want to should I search just put in Nala Christian and watch Google
(3:29:46) Christian that's it okay but if I see nudes the sin is on you because I didn't
(3:29:51) okay well okay hang on hang on then let me caveat it I'm not trying to get you in any trouble on your channel okay she
(3:29:56) was an only fan okay so you see so the the thing is is like do you believe
(3:30:02) it I I don't know anything about this person can you read their heart no yeah
(3:30:07) you know what I said publicly I want to believe it okay and don't you want to believe
(3:30:13) it um I mean to the extent said it makes her like happy sure yeah don't you want to believe that she repented don't you
(3:30:19) want to believe she wanting to believe wanting to believe in Donald Trump is different from him giving you any
(3:30:24) indication that he has gotten down on his hand hands and knees and asked Jesus
(3:30:30) Christ to forgive him where's he advocating for cuming when we look at his storied
(3:30:37) history I mean I just oh what about Nala's storyed history she was a prostitute until two weeks ago I don't
(3:30:42) know anything about this Nala person well okay let's just say not Nala let's just say there's a famous prostitute on
(3:30:47) the internet right now right this second okay totally famous prostitute who's who
(3:30:53) sucked that who sucked a thousand dicks and [ __ ] a thousand dudes and she says I'm repentant and I'm moving over to
(3:31:00) Christianity should shouldn't I want shouldn't I want to believe that if she deletes her only fans and she moves
(3:31:06) towards that shouldn't I want to believe it so for example like if that person was able to cite a single Bible
(3:31:14) verse you could cite a single Bible verse 5 seconds ago except what you had Googled that is patently fault I told
(3:31:21) you like Jesus said love the Lord your God and love your neighbor and that's a [ __ ] Bible verse you ask me to no that's not what the Bible verse says doy
(3:31:28) full of grace the Lord is with you yeah you remember you had you had muscle memory of a prayer you had heard 80 times but when I when if I ask you to
(3:31:34) quote a Bible verse off the top of your head can you close your eyes hold your hands up and do it I'm not the one like
(3:31:40) just answer me could you do it uh yes I could then do it okay this is Bible
(3:31:46) verse yeah close your eyes and do it close them okay close your eyes no
(3:31:51) minute no minute just do it you're doing this [ __ ] where you're trying to get my I know that you're typing bro I know
(3:31:56) you're typing my hands are right here bro then put keep them up and close your eyes and give me a Bible verse okay keep
(3:32:03) them up keep them up keep them up all right but you gotta give me a minute because if you keep talking you make me nervous and then my brain goes blank I'm
(3:32:08) not talking close your eyes so then I can't do it I am the way I am the light the way
(3:32:14) of the father is through me okay and what verse is that I don't [ __ ] know you asked me to give you a verse and I
(3:32:21) won nailed it bro okay so so like there's a difference
(3:32:26) between Nala and is that the only one you know off the top of my head right now maybe yeah maybe it's been like it's
(3:32:33) been like 20 years man so are you holding Trump to a different standard than you're holding yourself maybe I don't pretend to all right let's get
(3:32:39) through a few more of these super chats guys Rick Josie for five bucks says as Michael nsw say the body is a Temple and
(3:32:46) Temple needs incense I'm going broke but this is fun appreciate you Rick Josie
(3:32:51) thank you very much see fish in the chat good to see sea fish for five bucks says I've been with you since almost the
(3:32:57) beginning I've been with you since almost the beginning as in with rattles TV because we appreciate it solo ones 20
(3:33:05) bucks no context appreciate the support thank you solo ones let's carry on guys and to be a Christian so this guys for
(3:33:12) hours I forgot aot yeah but couldn't you be a Christian couldn't you be a Christian and not be able to cite a
(3:33:18) Bible verse would you think that that was like acceptable I mean like for example
(3:33:23) there's a lot of people I think there's a lot of people in the way that our minds work like for instance if I read the Lord of the Rings and you read the
(3:33:29) Lord of the Rings I can tell you the entire story of The Lord of the Rings but if you said if you go to chapter
(3:33:35) eight and you go to paragraph three what does it say I think most people couldn't tell you but that doesn't mean that they
(3:33:40) don't know the verse or they don't know the meaning and I think it's a cheap shot right ultimately
(3:33:46) we're into the last hour of this guys feeling a bit incredulous the final
(3:33:51) round do you believe that Donald Trump sincerely repented and is living a
(3:33:57) Christian Life or do you think he was trying to ingratiate himself with Evangelical voters that he needed in the
(3:34:04) election oh I think he's I not only do I think that he's living a Christian Life it couldn't point to anything that would determine
(3:34:12) otherwise could you I mean no let's just we can just we can
(3:34:19) just can you deter no we can't can you determine anything that he's doing that
(3:34:24) says he's not a Christian can you tell me what it is oh c can you give me an example of of things that he's done that
(3:34:31) give that has given you the indication that he's like a practicing Christian well assuming that we're going
(3:34:37) off the same criteria just laid down and you just agreed with right that most
(3:34:42) people probably most people probably would understand a verse and would understand
(3:34:47) where it came from and could even understand the story but that doesn't mean I isn't this funny guys how he came
(3:34:54) into this prepared he thought that he was going to sort of get Andrew trapped into a corner and do this sort of inter interview debate tactic and here's his
(3:35:02) arguments argument from hypocrisy very low form of argumentation and then orange man
(3:35:08) bad what did he think was gonna happen I could go can you go to article
(3:35:13) two paragraph three and tell me what it is that they would be able to memor it that they would be able to remember it
(3:35:20) sure my my frustration I think with a lot of conservatives is I wish they
(3:35:25) would just like okay if I was in your shoes and I believed that progressives
(3:35:30) like me are trying to uh grape children and destroy the nuclear family and
(3:35:36) Destroy Christianity and this that and the other thing obviously right if I was someone like
(3:35:42) you who believed such a thing obviously the uh option of voting for Joe Biden is just not on the table and even if that
(3:35:49) meant voting for somebody who is who who might violate every one of my religious principles I would do that because this
(3:35:56) is about policy that's a so I I wish a lot of people on the left had that position when it came to voting so I
(3:36:02) wish a lot of these Lefty purists who are mad that Joe Biden hasn't unilaterally stopped the war and done
(3:36:08) communism I wish that they would plug their nose and do what do what uh a lot of conservative voters do with Trump I
(3:36:13) just wish they would be honest about and I maybe you're being honest so I'm not going to commit to saying that this is bad faith or whatever it's just it's I
(3:36:20) think it's bad faith that you can't tell me how he's not a Christian that's bad faith to me it's just well when we talk
(3:36:26) about the brand of Christianity that or Catholicism that I was raised with again
(3:36:32) there was a heavy EMP emphasis when it came to Christ's teachings on forgiveness and Grace and loving your
(3:36:38) enemy and being eager to forgive people um and when I just watch him uh
(3:36:45) basically every time he opens his mouth he gives you the ick yeah he's mean yeah it gives you the
(3:36:50) ick right he's he's not very nice yes yeah so so what can you tell me anything
(3:36:55) that you would actually indicate that would prove to you that he was not a Christian other than it gives you the ick but but again it's not just because
(3:37:02) he gives me the EG he is Thoroughly dishonest like oh to to to to
(3:37:11) an amazing spectacular degree um is he and this is usually where you I feel
(3:37:17) like this conversation with you is far more dishonest than one I would have with Trump I think that Trump would answer my question D could be my dad
(3:37:24) could beat your dad up I think my dad would kick your dad's ass but anyway back to this my dad my
(3:37:33) dad he got old man how old are you by the way 40 how old's your dad he's 80 I think
(3:37:40) he'd still win or he's like 82 or something I don't I don't remember exactly how my dad he his back is [ __ ]
(3:37:45) bro so if your dad can move he's got a my dad's in a wheelchair I still think he win isn't that crazy though like um
(3:37:53) anyway who cares who cares but back back back to this back to this conversation I
(3:37:59) just want to know I I really do want to know bro what particular thing are you
(3:38:05) gon to indicate which tells you that Trump is not a
(3:38:10) Christian his uh extensive backlog of
(3:38:15) just insane quotes like for example saying to Ivanka if I wasn't your dad maybe we'd
(3:38:22) be having sex I think is not in line with my concept of Christianity I think
(3:38:29) incest is uh in the Bible but read the quote what did he say yeah wait are you
(3:38:36) pushing back against this that was crazy to say that was crazy for him to say bro
(3:38:41) I think that you mischaracterize what was said read the quote I think he said maybe I said sex
(3:38:47) and and maybe uh he said dating so you lied so I should hold that against you no I misremembered chill oh but but with
(3:38:54) Trump it's always everything's a lie so you just lied about Trump but Trump's a liar hold on hold on this is this is
(3:39:00) your defense this is your defense that this is a normal thing to say what thing
(3:39:07) to say that if I wasn't your dad maybe we'd be dating you don't think that that's read the exact read the exact
(3:39:13) quote why are you being picky about this because I want to make sure you're not
(3:39:19) lying do you remember the quote that I'm talking about I think I remember uh something about it but I don't know it
(3:39:25) so I want to make sure that I get it right you want me to if you want me to Google it I can good do that
(3:39:33) yeah didn't say anything about having sex with her that was absurd you just added that because you wanted to make
(3:39:38) him look as bad as possible because you're dishonest left as [ __ ] that's why you added it y you [ __ ] just chill
(3:39:43) come on you know that's why you added it just say that that's why you added it no because in the same in this it was
(3:39:49) either in the same interview or a different interview somebody asked Donald Trump what do you have in common
(3:39:55) with your daughter Ivanka and he he started his answer by saying uh I was gonna say sex and then he went on to
(3:40:01) something else like two okay I will look up the quote look up the
(3:40:08) quote I'm just I I'm incredulous again because I know you've heard this quote
(3:40:13) right I don't remember anything about him saying he was going to have sex with her okay that's what you just
(3:40:19) said cuz he's dishonest left as [ __ ] it's
(3:40:28) true otter chat was she on the uh the view hold on so Donald Trump yeah she
(3:40:33) was on that's my understanding is that a joke like it's a
(3:40:41) joke you see why the quote is if Ivanka weren't my
(3:40:47) daughter perhaps I'd be dating her isn't that terrible is that is that a joke it's a
(3:40:56) joke you see why he said isn't that terrible at the end of it you don't think you you don't think that's a weird
(3:41:02) I think he cracked the joke bro do you think it was a little bit weird like for instance when when Joe Biden talked
(3:41:08) about the beads do do you remember when Joe Biden talked about the beads of hair falling off of a young girl's leg and
(3:41:15) then he sniffs little girls hair don't you think that's a little weird when he sniffs girls hair do you think it's weird that Donald Trump walked into the
(3:41:22) dressing room of Miss Teen Universe just kind of walked around while they were getting changed he owned the
(3:41:28) [ __ ] no you are not defending that dude I didn't defend anything I said he I
(3:41:33) said he owned the [ __ ] you said he owned it that's a defense and was he a d my issue this is my issue was a d my issue
(3:41:39) I wish that you guys would just say like what I'm trying to say you just keep on [ __ ] speaking in Tong cuz you're
(3:41:46) he's probably not practicing Christian he probably has not asked Christ for forgiveness but I'm just not going to
(3:41:52) vote Trump derangement syndrome so let me ask you this is him walking around is
(3:41:58) him walking now Universe do you agree that Biden is a Catholic he goes to church every Sunday
(3:42:06) when is Donald Trump what does Donald Trump go to church bro I just asked you a simple question do you think Biden's a
(3:42:11) Catholic he is a practicing Catholic and has been his entire life do you think it's a little weird that he smells
(3:42:17) little girls heads are you making the are you making the case that he out here like molesting little boys and girls no
(3:42:23) I just asked you a simple question is that weird I think he's uh he's got some
(3:42:28) interesting mannerism sometimes do I think he a is it weird I didn't ask you that question I'm gonna ask you again
(3:42:35) just listen to what I ask you not what you try to infer again very lazy form of
(3:42:41) argumentation do you think it's weird don't need to be like a think it's weird when Biden smells little girls heads I
(3:42:49) think he's got some interesting mannerism sometimes do you think it's weird do you think he wants to [ __ ] them
(3:42:56) no I didn't say that I just asked if it was weird sure then oh it's weird Okay so yeah so then that comment was that
(3:43:03) comment was weird and what Biden does is weird let me ask you this why is it why is it that um I'm supposed to side with
(3:43:11) you on Biden's weirdness and shouldn't I say he's not a real Christ Chris because uh he made that comment one time that's
(3:43:18) what you try to infer about Trump you can do whatever you want I mean if you want to make an argument if you want to make an AR argument that Donald Trump is
(3:43:24) more of a Christian than than Biden you can try to if it weren for this last if it weren't for this last thing that he
(3:43:29) said see if Ivanka weren't my daughter perhaps I'd be dating her if he ended it there that sounds awful but he says
(3:43:36) isn't that terrible hahaa he's joking he's making a clear joke yeah that makes
(3:43:43) it not weird yeah makes it less weird it makes it less weird than Joe Biden going over and smelling ivanka's hair cuz he
(3:43:50) wants to smell what kind of [ __ ] shampoo she had that morning actually I actually think it's more weird to say
(3:43:55) that perhaps we would be dating that's that's that's even if it's qualified as a joke I mean yeah so like people who make
(3:44:03) people who make one zillion public statements they make one which is stupid you're going to hold that against that
(3:44:08) you're going to hold that against him indef trying to have a coners I was trying to have a conversation with you about the idea that you
(3:44:15) take him at his word sincerely that he is a repentant Christian I don't know his heart bro well okay so for for
(3:44:22) example you mentioned before that Jesus whipped people and turned some tables over in a church because there were
(3:44:28) Merchants doing doing business right yeah how do you feel about Donald Trump
(3:44:33) selling a $65 Bible what about it do you think that's
(3:44:39) appropriate yeah what's wrong with that I'm just guess I'm just trying to gauge where you're at I'm not gonna if
(3:44:45) if you say that you're fine with it then I guess that's the end of it um to me just answer my question what's wrong
(3:44:50) with it selling a $65 Bible I like that to me seems like is this is this a
(3:44:58) common practice that's laid out in scripture where you can you can you can like profit off of uh religious
(3:45:04) iconography or or or or texts or whatever I I almost all iconographers that I'm aware of who make icons profit
(3:45:12) they have to support their families and they have to support their children they have raise money for various things and I don't think that I think that those
(3:45:18) people you would agree that those people could buy a Bible anywhere for far less money right yeah but6 so why are they
(3:45:25) buying that one okay why are they buying that one we can agree to why are they
(3:45:30) buying that they're buy they're buying that one because they want to support him financially that's right they want to support him financially I'm asking
(3:45:36) I'm asking if you think you should be extracting exorbitant value from a text like scripture I mean it's one thing to
(3:45:43) I mean he could have he could have made money on any number of things he could have sent autograph pictures of himself or what it was the Bible but you say you
(3:45:50) say that doesn't violate any kind of sense of decency for you then I take your you just literally said it was not
(3:45:56) about selling the Bible it was about supporting Trump and one of the things that dude was from but it was but it was
(3:46:03) made off of holy text to me that seems a little strange to you it doesn't okay well let me ask you a counter question
(3:46:09) I'm just a stupid stupid argument if you ask me I mean you there's a lot of things that you could sell yeah I mean Trump was selling his cards and stuff
(3:46:15) that's that's more ridiculous selling the the cards nfts I mean whatever if people want to buy his stuff and support
(3:46:22) his campaign there's just nothing wrong with that and if one of the ways you want to do it is by selling a Bible and actually giving out thousands and
(3:46:28) thousands and thousands and thousands of Bibles that seems to be a positive thing to me people are supporting him they
(3:46:35) want to be able to pay and they get a Bible it's it enriches both parties and it makes America great again what's
(3:46:42) actually wrong with that question to this bad argument that debate that you
(3:46:47) uh referenced earlier with Matt dillah Hunty where he ran out of the room and you were upset because you didn't feel like it was very Christian of me to
(3:46:53) defend myself with verbal combat when somebody was literally assaulting me can
(3:46:58) you explain to me I'm going to give you the same argument that I gave to him how does your secular worldview lead to
(3:47:04) human flourishing if it leads to a reproduction crisis can you explain that to me how does my secular world
(3:47:13) view benefit the world if it leads to a to a to a birthing crisis yeah yep good
(3:47:20) point um well I think that the benefits of a secular go well beyond uh birth
(3:47:28) rates we're talking about how you structure government we're talking about how you structure Society we're talking
(3:47:34) about how you derive um societal Norms these all of those structures lead to a
(3:47:40) reproduction crisis aren't they bad structures not necessarily because you
(3:47:45) can you can address the the the downtick in in the amount of children that people
(3:47:52) are having through through a mechanism like immigration oh and where are you gonna get those people from we already
(3:47:58) been through this bro it's gonna be about it's gonna be nothing about Christians coming into the country from Nigeria and South well it's going to be
(3:48:04) religious people they're the ones reproducing right yeah and you're going to outbreed us and then I guess you're going to so the question becomes isn't
(3:48:11) it a bizarre isn't it a bizarre policy to Institute these policies like in Japan for instance and in South Korea
(3:48:18) you know you know the South Korean birth rate is at less than one child per woman less than
(3:48:24) one yeah and then in Japan they have such a crisis on their hands that they
(3:48:30) know that there's more grandfathers in the there's there's going to end up being more people in the grandfather
(3:48:36) Arena and in that age than there are going to be young people to support those grandfathers and the same the same
(3:48:42) thing hang on the same thing is the tick down continues right yeah do you think that
(3:48:48) that's good a good ideology and if you could have another ideology where people thrived and they
(3:48:53) flourish and that ideology happen to be religious why would you as a secularist
(3:48:58) not endorse that ideology over your own because you seem to think that the only way that you can Thrive is by
(3:49:04) having children I understand that's your position how do you how do you have human flourishing without human
(3:49:10) sir well we're talking about individual experiences so if you're talking about somebody flourishing that could be flourishing in their career they could
(3:49:16) be flourishing in their spiritual growth they have to have been born to do they have to be alive they have to exist to
(3:49:21) do all of that right I think I feel like you're distorting the question we're talking I don't feel like I am you are
(3:49:28) you are saying that a human being needs to exist they have to
(3:49:33) exist what I this argument is blowing my mind a bit I'm saying a human being does
(3:49:40) not need to breed spawn in to flourish
(3:49:45) as a human being of course if they don't have a baby not they don't [ __ ] ex
(3:49:51) that's right and so those people who are flourishing by your metric they had to have been born in order to
(3:49:58) flourish what is this argu do you understand what I'm saying I'm saying human beings can flourish with or
(3:50:04) without children if if people want to have kids they could not flourish if their parents did not have
(3:50:12) children I I I I'm I'm really struggling with you right now I know you've been struggling the entire conversation so
(3:50:18) let me just make it easy can human flourishing exist AB
(3:50:23) humans no but not everybody needs to have babies it's my point do you
(3:50:29) understand do you understand that you have to at least reproduce your population in order to sustain Humanity
(3:50:35) if you're asking me that if I want like the human species to continue to exist
(3:50:41) exist my answer is going to be of course yes why if you're asking me
(3:50:46) why it's a difficult question to ask because at the end of the day like it is a difficult question I
(3:50:53) oscillate some depending on the day between like a cosmic nihilist and a d you're you're yeah so your so your
(3:50:59) worldview leads to nihilism right no I don't see I like I said I oscillate
(3:51:04) between like a deist and and a cosmic nihilist like let's read these super chats before it gets too ridiculous guys
(3:51:11) John Don says I think being one inch away from being unived would make anyone way more Christian agreed Ryan Slater
(3:51:17) says if there's a tsunami warning for Northern California including the Bay Area don't tell the Liberals I just actually Googled that guys and I saw
(3:51:23) there's a tsunami warning there was an earthquake there in California hope no one's there and uh hope everyone's all
(3:51:29) right there uh King ginger for five bucks says 65 for a nice Bible as average good
(3:51:35) Leather Bible leatherbound KJV Bible the first one that shows up is $60 on sale
(3:51:41) what's the difference exactly John D says man this debate is just a bully shoving a nerd into a
(3:51:47) locker at this point it is and wedging him and stealing his lunch money exactly at one point all matter and energy was
(3:51:53) confined to the space that smaller than the size of the head of a pin when I
(3:51:58) think about that and when I think about theast someone's asking like what a cosmic nihilist is so nihilism is just
(3:52:05) the belief that everything is meaningless and there is no greater meaning to life and a cosmic nius means
(3:52:11) that the whole entire universe the whole Cosmos is is actually meaningless so and
(3:52:17) there is no God of the universe and when I think about the vastness of time I experience
(3:52:25) a sense of awe and wonder and I experience a sense of like connection with the universe and so for me this
(3:52:31) like Cosmic nihilism is not necessarily a negative thing but I also am open to
(3:52:36) the idea of something causing that explosion to happen got it got it but back to this back to this on birth rates
(3:52:42) you realize that Contracting the number of human beings on planet Earth leads to a decline in infrastructure a decline in
(3:52:49) service a decline in logistics all of the things which provide food for the entire world super chat away from hit
(3:52:56) our thir absent if you decide to contract the human population that goes
(3:53:01) way the [ __ ] down for instance explorers can't explore people can't create new medical Technologies people can't do
(3:53:08) Logistics they can't do it how it was done because it requires 8 billion people to maintain current
(3:53:13) infrastructure as we have it appreciate all the support today guys it's been absolutely fantastic that's 90 super
(3:53:20) chats today if we get 10 more we'll hit 100 and that will by far and a way smash our record and it'll make me do a lot
(3:53:26) more of these lives so if you had a massive contraction 10 more get 100 how
(3:53:32) much of the rest of the world would be an absolute [ __ ] Agony from that from
(3:53:37) just not having the human capital to deliver food from the countries that make it to deliver it to the countries
(3:53:43) that do not and the medical care and the doctors and all of the brain drain which would happen if you contracted the human
(3:53:49) population by billions of people I think that human beings are a resilient and
(3:53:55) resourceful species and I'm confident that the challenges that we face in the
(3:54:00) future that we will devise a way to deal with those problems but you have to
(3:54:06) exist to devise a way to to do that they have to exist sir I'm not against people
(3:54:12) having babies bro that's not my my point to you is that with with your
(3:54:17) epistemic nihilism if your epistemology is nihilistic give me one good reason
(3:54:23) then I said on suay why people should have babies because I think that the
(3:54:28) Human Experience of having Consciousness and experiencing this world is a beautiful thing and I want other beings
(3:54:35) to experience that you say you want human beings to be born so they can like
(3:54:40) get the wheels turning and get the fires going or whatever and that's NE NE that's true but I want human part of
(3:54:46) that whole experience that makes it wonderful etc etc yes to be productive so you want human beings to be alive so
(3:54:53) that they can experience life that's what you're saying so then shouldn't so then
(3:54:59) shouldn't you be a pronatalist and say more people should have babies I'm not an anti-natalist that's
(3:55:05) not my question shouldn't you be a pronatalist say people should have babies because the more creation of life means more people can experience those
(3:55:12) things I believe that we live where if you don't want to have babies
(3:55:17) you have that option but when for example statement I'm asking for an a shouldn't more people have babies if
(3:55:24) that leads to more people having those experiences look at him he's a Broken Man now he wants to ask the question
(3:55:29) again please shouldn't more people have babies if that leads to more people having those experiences which you value
(3:55:35) so much and why you think that we should have more people I think the difference between you and me is like I don't have
(3:55:40) a particular number in mind like I'm not in my head thinking like okay well we need to have 22 billion people okay how
(3:55:45) about just sustaining what we do have right now we need to have 40 billion how about just sustaining what we have right now sure but it's number we're not sure
(3:55:53) but okay well I mean I would have to look into your numbers I'm not sure what numbers you're looking at sure I will um
(3:55:59) but the the difference between you and me is that I'm not necessarily saying that like more life is inherently a good
(3:56:05) thing but I want the species to continue because I believe that we live in the most interesting and fascinating time in
(3:56:12) human history and I think uh being allowed to witness that for me is a good thing more wait wait I'm I'm so
(3:56:19) confused is the value of Life all of the experiences that you have and that's
(3:56:24) what makes it valuable and good not just that but it's also how you
(3:56:30) impact other people's lives that's my moral code and if there's more people there's more people to impact more people's lives right sure that's not a
(3:56:37) good that's I'm saying that's not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing but I I I believe think it's a good to
(3:56:43) continue human life sure but you seem to have a specific goal what what's your number like what how many billion people
(3:56:49) I think that just being able to replace yourselves is a pretty noble goal so you would be content with that so if the I
(3:56:55) would be content with at least self- reproduction so that we didn't have a contraction which I know will lead to
(3:57:01) catastrophe don't you think that's a noble goal true if I accept all of your premises and I would have to look at your numbers I I will look into it I'm
(3:57:08) curious then I would I would the argument that I would make is that you would want to obviously incentivize
(3:57:13) people to have these that's right you would does nihilism incentivize them to have babies sure can it's not because as
(3:57:21) I already mentioned according to me I think value they're gonna be
(3:57:26) incentivized according to you huh no people are gonna be incentivized by what by whatever they're incentivizing I'm
(3:57:32) not even trying to convince people that nihilism is the way to go I'm just saying yeah so what is a what we seeing
(3:57:38) right now is the perfect encapsulation of the problem with this nihilistic worldview I mean first of all if you
(3:57:43) actually look around at the world I know this see might seem like a basic sort of low IQ take I understand that but if you
(3:57:49) just look around at the world and if you look around at all the beauty of the world and all of the complexity of the
(3:57:54) world and human beings and you honestly think it's all just for nothing and it's all meaningless and it was all just like
(3:57:59) an accident we were just soup that evolved into philosophers I think that if you look at the world that way and you really think
(3:58:06) that everything is just meaningless then I think that is like the one of the most low IQ takes that you can have this
(3:58:13) is the problem with this sort of nihilist worldview right here it's like they don't care if everything just goes
(3:58:18) into extinction because nothing matters the idea of people being meaningful doesn't really register with them so if
(3:58:25) everybody just does sex drugs in rock and roll and just sort of vanishes out and Fades out of existence it doesn't even matter to them but uh the idea of
(3:58:33) keeping a a replacement rate I mean first of all if you want to do all of the sort of like Urban liberal nice
(3:58:38) things that you do you have to have a labor force and you have to have the
(3:58:44) population at replacement otherwise life will get a lot harder the only reason why life is so good at the moment is
(3:58:49) because we've had the we've had a baby boom we've had this IND these industrial revolutions and and having this
(3:58:55) increased labor force has meant that more can get done so um it doesn't work
(3:59:01) for them but they don't realize that because things are good right now and that's the only thing they care about what is a nihilistic prescript let's
(3:59:08) quickly read some of these super chats guys we have got six more Super chats until we get to 100 which is unbelievable KF for 10 bucks says
(3:59:14) supporting the channel that supports debates yes sir thank you very much we will be here supporting debates Casper Swift for 10 bucks says this kid comes
(3:59:21) off as an evasive [ __ ] of course we need to have kids to flourish dummy but
(3:59:27) the way but by the way like your stuff Jake been really enjoying you on Andrew's Tik Tok invasions we have a lot
(3:59:32) of fun with those Tik Tok invasions Jonathan diam for two bucks says let's get to 100 so we can get Invasion
(3:59:38) streams we will be getting those Invasion streams guys if we if we uh can make these uh make these worth it
(3:59:46) Achilles 801 for five bucks says why must they fill a buster all the time because they don't have a good answer
(3:59:51) and I think that we all kind of recognize that by now Jonathan for five bucks says H
(3:59:57) replace Catholicism with science worship and Jesus with NE Neil degrass Tyson and he's not the only one five more Super
(4:00:03) chats guys and we get to 100 should to this problem the same if it would be
(4:00:10) anything that would practically address the problem which would be which would be incentivizing birth rates
(4:00:16) that would sustain the human race well why should a nihilist do that they don't see an ought because they're nihilists
(4:00:22) my answer is because I believe we live in a [ __ ] magical Universe at a
(4:00:27) really interesting time in human history and I think people should see what happens next that's my but but how can
(4:00:35) annihilist give that a I just did what then you're not a nihilist you're appealing to something
(4:00:42) other than nihilism but secularism lives in nihilism nihilists can't make moral ODS because
(4:00:48) they're [ __ ] nihilists I'm not trying to frame this around morality I'm trying to tell I
(4:00:54) know everyone always refuses to engage in Morality because usually they're living a lifestyle which is because it's
(4:01:00) a boring conversation because you tell me yes because you tell me your morality is this thing and a Buddhist tells me
(4:01:06) their morality is that thing and Muslim tells me their morality is that thing and so it's just we've I we you and I
(4:01:12) both have probably had conversations about these conflicting ideologies thousands of times at this point in my life it's a boring conversation and
(4:01:18) you're not you can't tell me that you know for sure that your morals is like
(4:01:23) the move so you have your own subjective experience I can tell you for sure that my morals are the
(4:01:29) move for you no period they have to be true because all that matters is my
(4:01:35) subjective preference according to you dummy well you haven't convinced me I
(4:01:40) have you convinced me actually you said according to me my preferences are all that matters and my preferences are what
(4:01:47) makes me the ultimate arbender and what is moral so that standard would have to apply to me too you have convinced me
(4:01:53) that my moral preferences preferences That's The Logical extension of your of your position the ultimate Arbiter of
(4:01:59) morality you have to these things is somebody else okay is there anybody's else's preferences anybody else's
(4:02:06) preferences you can point to that are better than yours Pro probably who I don't know that I don't know the Dal
(4:02:12) Lama are they the ultimate AR then no I don't think anybody is is a nobody is
(4:02:18) yes so nothing nothing has any moral value there is no ultimate morality the
(4:02:23) value that people experience in their lives is the value that they assign to it through their own experience and is there any knowledge what I believe it
(4:02:30) sure yeah we then do we have knowledge of what is moral not not in my opinion we have
(4:02:37) knowledge we have knowledge of what you what certain cultures consider moral or religions consider moral so what is
(4:02:42) knowledge then knowledge is uh the accumulation of uh experience and facts
(4:02:48) in your mind but it's all subjective right yeah so we can't make any true statements no you can do some there you
(4:02:56) can have objectively true statements like 2 plus 2 equals four how do you know two plus two equals four you can't
(4:03:01) because smarter people before me came and figured this [ __ ] out so you're appealing to somebody else yes okay so
(4:03:08) let me ask you this two plus two two plus two will always equal four right
(4:03:14) uh to my knowledge yeah what do you mean to your knowledge is that true or is it not true well I don't know are you about
(4:03:20) to hit me with a curveball I'm just asking you a question will it always then is that
(4:03:26) objective yes that's an objective fact so it's an objective Truth uh
(4:03:31) oh yes so then objective truth exists yes not objective moral truth is
(4:03:38) my point oh well I don't understand if objective truth exists I you don't then there has to be some morality out there
(4:03:43) which is objectively true right the the concept of morality certainly exists but
(4:03:48) we all determine what our morality is is that think is that a true statement I
(4:03:54) believe it's true that's not but it's not objectively true you are seeming to
(4:04:00) just not understand the concept I don't because I don't understand what you're saying it makes no sense if you have
(4:04:06) knowledge of what is true difference between subjective reality and objective
(4:04:11) reality what is the difference 2 plus two equals 4 is something that we can demonstrate it's something that we can
(4:04:17) prove it's something that we can observe something like I don't think that men
(4:04:23) men should be having butt sex is not the same thing as uh you know the Moon is
(4:04:29) this far away from the Earth and it rotates at this at this angle and uh it takes this many days for it to uh to uh
(4:04:36) to circle the the Earth so there's no world there's no world which exists where 2 plus two isn't four right
(4:04:44) not according to our knowledge no it has to equal four right well it's an objective truth right it's an object yes
(4:04:50) that is an objective mathematical truth and it is an an inescapable truth and
(4:04:56) does mathema okay I agree does mathematics exist does mathematics exist in material
(4:05:02) reality it would have to right where can you point to it well I essentially it
(4:05:08) exists in our brains right it exists in our brains so so math wouldn't exist
(4:05:14) absent the brain 2 plus 2 wouldn't equal four if people weren't around to observe it that's strange I can't comprehend
(4:05:20) existence if there was nothing there that had the Consciousness to process existence now we're getting like that's
(4:05:26) right wait wait a second you couldn't comprehend existence if there wasn't
(4:05:31) something there to comprehend existence would that include material and
(4:05:36) immaterial conceptualizations which are always true like 2 plus 2 equals
(4:05:41) 4 yes of course did 2 plus 2 equal four even before human beings existed to know
(4:05:47) that that 2 plus 2 equal did but it took someone with Consciousness to discover
(4:05:53) this principle then it didn't exist before people it's not I mean I don't know it's
(4:05:59) hard to explain yeah it is because what you're what you're falling prey to is your metaphysical presuppositions so
(4:06:06) let's start with this falling pray to anything the laws of the laws of logic exist of the for instance the law of
(4:06:15) identity if there was no human Minds on planet Earth would there still be a
(4:06:20) planet Earth I mean yeah because at that point you would still have animals animals
(4:06:25) have Consciousness and could planet Earth ever be anything other than what it is which is planet Earth I mean these
(4:06:32) things exist in in in objective reality but but if we for example stop so I'm just goingon to walk you through it so
(4:06:38) that you understand excuse me excuse me but if there was you're just G to go on a diet trap I'm going to bring it right back no living before we do that guys
(4:06:46) this is hilarious this one because he's he he's not really understanding the basic philosophy here he said being
(4:06:52) asked does mathematics exist in in material reality um which obviously it
(4:06:58) doesn't and he's also saying like he's basically saying what is mathematics does 2 plus 2 always equal four well of
(4:07:04) course 2 plus 2 always equals four and hat is saying no no no we created it because somebody came along with
(4:07:10) Consciousness and discovered it but if they discovered it then what was it prior to being discovered so he's just
(4:07:16) he's not really getting it here all right let's read a few of these super chats I think we've only got one more
(4:07:25) until 100 I believe anyway uh z z Mo for
(4:07:30) five bucks says Jake have you heard of agenda 47 I heard the homeless policy is quite good I've heard the homeless policy is great and I've heard that the
(4:07:37) Tik Tok liberals love the homeless policy as well Miss D for eight bucks says shout
(4:07:43) out to Jake in chat will you be watching Joel keo's Dubai fight yeah yes I will um Joel is actually a friend of mine we
(4:07:50) used to train together at um uh Brisbane at East Side boxing in Brisbane he's a great lad we used to do some sparring
(4:07:57) although he wouldn't go too hard on me because he Bel me if he uh If he if he wanted to because he's a professional
(4:08:05) obviously uh Jonathan D for two bucks says LOL Andrew is running tag yep
(4:08:11) exactly right and he doesn't know so the transcendental argument is what he's talking about there and just this this goes way over this guy's head the
(4:08:18) transcendental argument is um uh suggesting that there are things that are that transcend uh our own our own uh
(4:08:26) existence basically that there are things that are that are natural and there are things that are objective and
(4:08:32) uh it's one that J die uses quite a lot and a lot of these guys use to challenge people's presuppositions but yeah it's
(4:08:40) not going to it's not going to go very well for him if Hutch tries to engage in the in the transcendental argument I
(4:08:46) think we've we've done the 100 super chats guys lazy Noir for two bucks says rely Super Chat anywhere here you go
(4:08:52) save UK with a Nigerian flag uh abject full for five bucks says
(4:08:59) tag argument is tag argument for God is such a game Ender the more I understand it the more I realize how much I take uh
(4:09:05) for granted so true guys because if you actually CH challenge people's presuppositions and if you look at the things that that that do transcend
(4:09:13) then uh it's it's really difficult for for particularly atheist to actually answer these questions um yeah it's it's
(4:09:20) a great argument I Jonathan Donan for 10 bu says
(4:09:25) I am 100 yes you are sir and 101 here Ricky Josie for five buck says Kum on
(4:09:31) then Kum on then get that 100 a great quality is to be able to remove all morality and preferences from the
(4:09:37) argument and debate what actually exists yeah it is interesting to see
(4:09:44) these guys uh to see him PR up this guy because it's a really brutal form of debate when you when you look at the
(4:09:50) presuppositional arguments and the transcendental arguments and these guys if they're not philosoph like this guy didn't understand the laws of logic so
(4:09:56) he's not like really philosophically trained but there are atheists who can have these debates but normally they
(4:10:02) they get pretty nervous about it but for a guy like this it's just he's it's going to go way over his head he's not even going to understand what what it
(4:10:09) means because he thinks that we've just sort of created our own morality and human beings have just just sort of created good and evil and we've created
(4:10:15) mathematics so um yeah he's completely underprepared for this conversation living being in the entire
(4:10:23) universe to experience reality I don't know how to describe that it's a very confusing concept okay so the planet
(4:10:29) Earth would exist and could never be anything other than planet Earth even absent your Consciousness correct well
(4:10:37) let's say a giant Comet comes and it fundamentally transforms com could not
(4:10:44) Com or let's say an alien species comes and conquers the planet and they decide they want to change it from shout outs
(4:10:50) to the chat I just want to say over 100 super chats uh way more it's over triple
(4:10:55) what we what we initially aimed for so I appreciate all the support today guys I really do appreciate it Earth to uh
(4:11:01) prime or whatever then it would be a different thing right but it but it would always be the thing that it is
(4:11:07) right sure in that moment a thing could never be anything other than what it is things can transform
(4:11:13) change but they would never be so like a cat could never be a
(4:11:19) dog it would always have to be a cat right maybe the science changes but currently it would always have to be a
(4:11:25) cat yes wait you're saying that you think that things can be things other than what they
(4:11:33) are what did I say that gave you that impression I because you said according to science one day maybe a cat could be
(4:11:39) a dog if they he's just getting him with just a basic law of logic here guys the
(4:11:45) law of identity the the cat has to be a cat because the law that that is a
(4:11:50) unchangeable transcendental law which is which is uh the law of identity cat has
(4:11:56) to be a cat basic law of logic he doesn't he doesn't understand how badly he's getting ripped here come up with a
(4:12:01) machine that you can put a cat in the machine and then it would become a dog
(4:12:06) then this aium would would no longer so then so then it would be so then it
(4:12:11) would be a dog right in this alternative Universe yes could it ever be anything other than what it
(4:12:20) is in the hypothetical machine that can turn a dog into a dolphin then yes but
(4:12:25) according to like it still would be a dolphin no it would still be a dolphin right even if I had a machine that
(4:12:31) turned a cat into a dog it would still be a dog it could not be anything other than what it is apply this to morality
(4:12:37) okay yes yes what apply this to morality I
(4:12:44) want to see the connection that you're making I'm going to show you I'm actually going to show you but first we have to understand that the law of
(4:12:50) identity exists a thing cannot be that which it is not okay is that true or
(4:12:58) false uh generally true yeah right if no not generally it's either true or it's
(4:13:03) not true because that would be the logical law of the excluded middle I'm trying to I'm trying to give you these like absurd hypotheticals that would
(4:13:10) maybe cut against that but in the world any hypoth cut it I'll engage with any of I I gave you the the machine that can
(4:13:17) turn a cat into a dog then it would be a dog and it would be what it is right yes so then the law of identity would still
(4:13:24) exist if you could turn a cat into a dog it would still be a dog therefore it would still be what it is okay sure okay
(4:13:29) that's the law of identity okay okay do you understand that I believe so would
(4:13:35) that still exist even absent human consciousness I believe so you don't
(4:13:41) know you think that absent human consciousness things would suddenly be things that they're
(4:13:46) not no they would exist yes and they would be what they are yes yes and those
(4:13:52) laws existed and exist outside of human knowledge yes really those laws exist
(4:14:01) outside of human consciousness yes yes I
(4:14:06) just want to make sure I got that right before I go on to the next part of this yes those laws existed outside of human
(4:14:13) Consciousness he appealing to something external to himself yes okay now it
(4:14:18) transcends his prefences I just got to I just got to know right just to kind of tie this up pretty neatly for you I
(4:14:26) really have to can you hear me go ahead go ahead
(4:14:31) yeah yeah I feel like you're just trying to escape but that's fine it'll be right
(4:14:37) back he needs to go and pay out of his vagina really quickly
(4:14:43) is's he going drain his vagina all right dude you gotta carry the stream for a second I'm gonna take a leak come on
(4:14:49) Andrew come on Andrew seriously no one wants to watch this guy
(4:14:56) Vape we're back boys I'm back where are we yeah I'm here okay
(4:15:02) good so back to where we were at what I'm saying to you is that knowledge presupposes we got in the chat one of
(4:15:09) the great mods over at the cral maybe she can do some uh it
(4:15:15) presupposes yeah so presupposition the laws of logic exist even absent human
(4:15:22) consciousness um would this presuppose a noer ask the question again would it if
(4:15:28) knowledge all right guys so this is this is interesting now because he's just said just before that he thinks that
(4:15:35) there are laws of logic that exist outside of human consciousness so we didn't make it it wasn't our preferences
(4:15:42) they exist these are objective laws of logic such as the law of identity he's just admitted to that okay let's take
(4:15:48) this back just a little bit yes it presupposes a noer yeah so
(4:15:54) presupposition the laws of logic exist even absent human consciousness um would this presuppose a
(4:16:02) noer ask the question again would it if knowledge presupposes a noer
(4:16:09) correct if not the existence of knowledge necessitate someone who knows things is that what you're saying it
(4:16:15) presupposes that there's a knower if there's knowledge yes and the laws of
(4:16:21) logic right this is this is knowledge correct sure would you presuppose then
(4:16:26) that there was a knower sure who would that
(4:16:33) be each individual no no no no no there's no human consciousness in this hypothetical I'm
(4:16:40) lost in this hypothetical the laws of exist just admitted it yeah what when
(4:16:48) you say the laws of logic can you inform me and what you mean yeah I just I I gave you one of
(4:16:54) them the law of identity okay A Thing cannot be a thing which it is not this is something that exists in in
(4:17:01) in a human mind oh it's only a product of the human mind he just but it exist
(4:17:07) in a human mind it only exists in a human mind so how come if we took the human mind out of it you agreed that things could only be what they
(4:17:14) are I'm I'm talking about a difference between an experienced reality and a physical
(4:17:20) reality yeah so am I so I'm saying let's take out the phys imagine being this guy
(4:17:26) and having been in this debate for over three hours now and then getting hit with the with the transcendental argument for God and with the Pres with
(4:17:33) getting presed after after three hours when you've lost every all of the sort of like easy ones all the ones that are
(4:17:39) that are much more sort of uh like easy arguments for you to actually sort of come up with something about and then
(4:17:44) you get hit with this after three hours this what's when you just get buried physical reality portion of it and use
(4:17:50) the metaphysical reality which is the reality of concept or things like this
(4:17:56) absent your mind with the laws of logic
(4:18:01) exist tie this to morality I am trying to I'm trying to explain to you how
(4:18:07) knowledge requires knowledge requires a knower a Justified true belief you're doing it in a
(4:18:13) not okay let's make it simple yes please try to I'll try to make it simple
(4:18:18) because you just don't [ __ ] understand but before I do answer a basic question super basic how would you
(4:18:24) feel if you hadn't eaten breakfast this morning i' be hungry okay well you got that one so I guess you got that the
(4:18:31) chat always ask me to ask so I always ask it means nothing literally means nothing it's I you guys think it's about
(4:18:36) IQ still I'm aware yeah yeah yeah I don't think that I know it's a meme on forchan I just think it's funny the chat
(4:18:42) always asked me so anyway let's bring it back to let's bring it back to morality then if you have so that you understand
(4:18:50) if you have no justification for Morality if you say that there is no moral stance you have which is Justified
(4:18:56) other than preference then anybody else's preference is just as Justified as your own and if you say that you're
(4:19:01) not the ultimate Arbiter then this would mean that somebody else and if they are not the ultimate
(4:19:07) Arbiter but it is within their preferences to be why would they be wrong why does there need to be an
(4:19:13) ultimate Arbiter of of of morality because it's a logical entailment I'm going to explain it so it's a logical
(4:19:19) entailment it works like this if you say my preferences all right are what I believe are moral somebody else says but
(4:19:27) my preferences are what I believe are moral you would make world we live in you would make the determination both of
(4:19:33) you are correct I would make the determination that this person believes this thing and I believe mine my thing yeah okay but
(4:19:41) which one of you is correct obviously I would believe that well
(4:19:46) different things are going to work for different people and I'm not going to have the expectation no you were about
(4:19:51) to say I would believe that minor correct right well in a way but in a
(4:19:57) personal experience is my point we all experience morality in a in a personal
(4:20:02) subjective way you morality are your morals inside of your preference correct
(4:20:09) for me should everybody else follow them no I don't I'm not I'm not advocating
(4:20:15) for so other people have better morals than you better moral systems than you maybe why then why don't you follow
(4:20:21) those it's a work in progress right I'm not sure what that means wouldn't you if
(4:20:26) somebody else had Superior morals to you from your preferences why wouldn't you follow those morals it means that to me
(4:20:33) as a thinking living person I personally exists in the pursuit of trying to be a
(4:20:40) better person and so the what I believe today better wait a better person that would so that does that mean that other
(4:20:46) people are better than you yeah sure probably who well when we're talking
(4:20:52) about better you know some people just constantly contradicting his own worldview when he says a better person
(4:20:57) it would mean that some people are better than other people so it mean that there's a gradation of morality some
(4:21:03) things are more good than other things so then again if you want to say that then then you you have to actually
(4:21:08) justify that you have to have a moral justification for why things are better than other things the entailment of his argument here is so funny and the the
(4:21:15) whole like line of his argument because it started off with the my preferences argument my preferences my preferences
(4:21:21) it all just matters about preferences and then it goes into the idea of logic he doesn't understand what laws of logic
(4:21:27) are but then he gets walked in to admitting that laws of logic do exist that the law of identity does exist
(4:21:33) external himself so not just because he thinks it exists but external himself it always exists and so does mathematics
(4:21:41) and now he's back into saying no no no but it's all just subjective this guy is
(4:21:46) just not people are better like jumpers than me some people are talking about moral claims
(4:21:51) so well again I'm I'm an open-minded person right and so like I have my set
(4:21:58) of morality that's rooted primarily in empathy that's how I choose to live my
(4:22:04) life if somebody were to come along and to impart some lesson upon me and I felt
(4:22:09) like I connected with it I felt like I could use it to be of service to my community and my relationships then I
(4:22:16) would be amenable to incorporating that new philosophy in my moral code okay so
(4:22:21) now let me explain to you the problem here if you make the claim if you make the claim there that people ought not
(4:22:28) follow your preferences I'll make the claim that people ought to follow my preferences and you can't argue however
(4:22:34) if you make the claim if you make the claim that both of our preferences are equal then that would mean that your
(4:22:39) preferences are no better than my own and if you were to make to claim that my preferences were Superior then you ought
(4:22:44) to follow my preferences that's how it works you can make that case and tell me this is why I think my morality is
(4:22:51) better and this is what this is how scripture informs my belief system and this is how religion is crafted the way
(4:22:56) that I treat other people and treat people around you all these kinds of things but why do I ever need to make a justification outside of my preferences
(4:23:03) if you don't you don't but if I don't if I don't are mine wrong and yours are
(4:23:09) right if you wanted to try to convince me that your way was the correct way in my opinion you have not adequately done
(4:23:15) that now you perspective well I remain unconvinced that you remain unconvinced
(4:23:21) so let me explain this to you again are your preferences better than mine for me they are I would want to
(4:23:29) live your life your life sounds like a nightmare should everybody live the preferences that you have no then why
(4:23:35) are my preferences inferior to your own because you believe in crazy [ __ ] according to my belief
(4:23:41) systems yes yes okay that's my sub reality is that your your life and
(4:23:47) world is insane so then I should follow your I should follow your preferences right do whatever you want bro no I
(4:23:54) should follow your if if mine are worse than yours should not follow yours I do
(4:24:00) not care what you do with your life so then my preferences are equal to your
(4:24:05) own sure okay so then I should not follow any of your preferences if you
(4:24:11) don't want to and they're equal to yours sure okay well then everybody should follow mine and they would be right
(4:24:17) correct because it's equal to you well we don't believe the same thing so it's not equal in that sense there's very
(4:24:24) there going be very I'm confused are your preferences better or worse than mine for me I would prefer my
(4:24:31) preferences and nobody should follow nobody should follow your preferences outside of you right thanks to support if they want to they can but if they
(4:24:38) don't want to they shouldn't right sure okay but if I say then that preference that everybody follows my preference and
(4:24:44) it's equal to your own then they should follow my preferences no I don't believe that I don't understand how you can how
(4:24:51) then refute it because I believe that the things that you believe in or some of the things that you believe in some
(4:24:57) of the things that you express cause cause harm such in in the same way that
(4:25:02) you believe that the things that I espouse cause harm so naturally I wouldn't want people to subscribe to
(4:25:08) your particular world view it's inferior to yours right that doesn't mean that I
(4:25:14) think that people shouldn't be Christian I just don't think people should take it to the extent that you do let try this a different way should everybody follow if
(4:25:22) you had a choice that everybody follow my worldview or yours should they follow yours mine if
(4:25:28) I like if you forc me to push one button or the other and it's like it's gonna be one of those outcomes I would obviously
(4:25:34) pick me then that would mean that my preferences are not equal to Yours by your worldview for me
(4:25:42) right but if it's for you you're saying for me your preferences have a lesser
(4:25:49) value right my preferences have a lesser
(4:25:56) value I don't think your worldview would benefit other people is my point
(4:26:04) yeah I get it so so it's less valuable than your own right that would be one way to express it sure okay so then
(4:26:09) between the two of us you would be the ultimate arbiter of what is moral if there was only two of us left on planet
(4:26:15) Earth right yes I'm the yes I'm the ultimate and that would be based on your preferences right sure so then therefore
(4:26:21) if I had so then therefore if I said my preferences actually are the most moral
(4:26:26) thing not his own I'm just doing the exact same you're thing you're doing right yeah so what would actually make
(4:26:33) them worse it's up to the individual right nothing so so ultimately if we're
(4:26:39) arbitrating preferences it always just comes back it always just comes back to equal logic
(4:26:45) right it always just comes back to your preferences are just as valid as my own hold on so when we talk about like moral
(4:26:52) differences so like a Buddhist believes that it is I don't know if they believe it's immoral to have attachments right
(4:27:00) that's that's a belief that they have that's like a principle that they live their life by and you say that uh you
(4:27:07) know your according to your moral code it's wrong to take the Lord name of like
(4:27:13) how do you how do you prove to me that these that one thing is better than the other the the difference between you and
(4:27:19) me is that I'm not putting that pressure on you yeah you wouldn't need to because in my in my ideal world people would
(4:27:24) have the freedom to explore these different ideas because because of this because absent justification if there's
(4:27:30) no justification outside of personal preference then I would no more need to justify my personal preference uh than
(4:27:37) you would and there so therefore you can never make an moral a against my preference because
(4:27:42) it's literally as Justified as your own me essentially yes well then then what
(4:27:50) are you arguing with me for everybody should follow my preferences no what
(4:27:56) they're just as Justified as yours but they're in my mind they are not right
(4:28:01) but they are because you just said they were 15 times you're talking about logical
(4:28:07) justification the reason why I don't think people should subscribe to your world view is because I think it leads
(4:28:13) to uh suffering but it's just as Justified as your worldview it's just from your personal perspective so if
(4:28:18) it's from personal perspective preference and it has just as much justification as yours I say everybody
(4:28:24) ought to follow mine than they ought to that's what you believe I mean that's just the truth right I have no I have no
(4:28:30) doubt that this is what you believe but you have not convinced me that I don't understand how could I not convince you
(4:28:36) of the entailment of my justification for all morality is my
(4:28:42) Hutch says justification for all morality Hutch's preference Andrew says justification for all morality Andrew's
(4:28:49) preference okay then what's the justification for all of your morality outside of preference I'm not trying to
(4:28:54) justify all of morality I think morality is an individual
(4:28:59) experience okay it's an individual experience that does not need to be justified right I'm not trying to foist
(4:29:06) my particular view of morality onto the people around me do to be justified
(4:29:14) right I believe that they are entitled to explore that on their own and
(4:29:20) hopefully a moral position at the end of that that that does little harm that
(4:29:27) actually benefits to people around them that leaves the world in a better place than it was before now obviously you and
(4:29:32) I are going to have different standards of how that manifests do you need to justify your do you need to justify your
(4:29:39) morality outside of your preference to whom to
(4:29:46) anybody including yourself you need to justify it to yourself in the sense that this should
(4:29:51) be something that you give conscious thought to okay yeah you give conscious thought to but can you justify it
(4:29:57) outside of your own preferences it should be something that you explain that you can
(4:30:02) explain explain your justification outside of preference but the justification for my morality outside of
(4:30:09) your own preference yeah the justification for my morality is that I have experienced suffering so preference
(4:30:15) during during this during this world and in that experience of suffering on
(4:30:20) various occasions of my life in pain I have developed a code of morality that
(4:30:26) leads me to the position that it's it it would be a good thing for me according
(4:30:32) to my concept of good to try to alleviate suffering when I can find it and are any of those things external to
(4:30:38) your own preferences are any of the ideas that I just espouse I mean other people can
(4:30:45) come up with these ideas but these are this is what I came up with so it's your preferences so you haven't Justified anything outside your own preferences so
(4:30:51) neither do I but my the difference between us is that I think everybody ought to follow my preferences and not
(4:30:58) yours you can't tell me that I'm wrong because my justification is the exact same as yours nothing yeah I can't I
(4:31:04) can't tell you so my morals are just as valid as yours they're just as good as yours everything is just as Justified as
(4:31:10) your own and people ought to follow mine you're
(4:31:15) right if you listen I understand that you think that everybody should subscribe to your specific but so do you
(4:31:23) because they're exactly Justified the same way I don't I simply do not believe
(4:31:28) that the world should be required to act in a manner that is in accordance with
(4:31:33) my moral philosophy I know you don't think that but they're Justified on your
(4:31:38) preferences as our mine which are equal to Yours by your own logic therefore my preferences are that they ought so they
(4:31:45) should okay and your preferences are that they should not so they shouldn't you see how that
(4:31:51) works let's agree to disagree you agree to disagree with logic okay I I we I feel like we have
(4:31:58) been repeating the same thing to for about an hour and 15 minutes I don't know why I can't get you to understand it and and I'm over it okay that's fine
(4:32:07) okay what do you want to move on to now can we go back to the to the hypocrisy thing what what's the next thing you wanted to move to
(4:32:12) more than anything I want this conversation to end but I appreciate your time oh you want to leave yeah
(4:32:17) you're all done done yeah oh okay I don't blame you I to do you well I have
(4:32:24) some people want to call in and talk to you would you talk to them no I'm not interested okay I didn't think so all
(4:32:29) right well have a nice day Hutch you too man good luck with life I don't need it
(4:32:34) but have a nice [Laughter] one cries in the chat guys tears in the
(4:32:41) chat tears in the chat how much fun is that that was
(4:32:48) fun it looked like a lot of fun you really love to see it
(4:32:53) guys what should we do next guys you reing next stream which will
(4:33:00) be probably in the next few days if you guys want to do it I mean this was a successful stream so what should we do
(4:33:07) next because there's more there's more uh debates to be to be
(4:33:13) reviewed on here one particular one that we might be able to review is uh let me
(4:33:19) show
(4:33:25) you oh rattlesnake vers Brad Palumbo hey maybe a little sneak peek if anybody's
(4:33:31) seen this one but how fun was that watching him just get absolutely molded for 4 hours
(4:33:38) you really love to see it that's the beauty of having something for 4 hours like that you're doing manifestation
(4:33:44) wrong and I can prove it Rumble many people getting this wrong they try
(4:33:50) to you probably are doing manifestation wrong though to be fair yes it's legal
(4:33:58) and Sith Lord um so I appreciate your patience today I'd like to before we get
(4:34:03) into a closing so somewhat short debate today we'll have a little bit of a little bit of a look at the start and
(4:34:09) then may when you're ready with your opening stat you got 10 minutes on the clock yes sir what's up to The Crucible crew
(4:34:15) great to be with you all on this fine day sorry if I'm a little bit tired today I had a big Halloween last night
(4:34:21) defending the honor of the Sith Lord um so I appreciate your patience today I'd like to thank Brad for coming out today
(4:34:28) uh this is a very important debate about the red pill I appreciate you taking taking me up on this one so I think it's
(4:34:33) important to start off with some definitions here so normally when I talk about now guys if you if you want to see
(4:34:40) it you just got to let me know in the chat just why I do have to go and have some dinner and I've got a few things to do
(4:34:45) tonight why is in the chat if you want to see it we'll do that in the next few days it was a an interesting one we've got Brad Palumbo here uh who is a gay
(4:34:53) guy a gay liberal classical liberal libertarian sort of thing and he's very
(4:34:59) anti- any sort of red pill very like sort of uh toxic masculinity sort of thing and we uh debated it we debated
(4:35:05) feminism and all of these sorts of things so it was a pretty fun debate and I'll do that in the coming days if you
(4:35:10) guys want to see it D it's a trap for two bucks and says Hutch's whole morality
(4:35:16) comes from the Paradigm of live love life we saw that one before but yeah guys if you do want to
(4:35:21) see it why is in the chat and we'll do that in the coming days and we'll review it I think I think I got The W I think I
(4:35:28) got The W don't want to be too arrogant about it don't want to put too much air in my
(4:35:35) en ties but I think I go the W there's probably one or two parts where I I took an L definitely things I could improve
(4:35:41) but um I think it was a w anyways guys thank you so much for all the support don't forget to smash the like button on
(4:35:47) the way out if you if you uh enjoyed the video if you're uh getting value from it
(4:35:53) and uh appreciate you all being here today thanks for all the support over 100 super chats which is amazing we got to do these lives more often um and uh I
(4:36:03) don't know someone says raid jimbob I would I would I would let's just go review what Jim Bob's doing Maybe
(4:36:14) you guys are going to see oh PE
(4:36:20) Morgan yeah we'll see is Jim Bob live is
(4:36:26) he so if you guys are here still of the state of the world of the church not of the
(4:36:34) world so I just don't find this it's not only not compelling but it does
(4:36:42) in in uh in having an empowering Christian context for marriage it's a
(4:36:48) disempowering context for marriage and if it's a disempowering context for marriage you're not actually criticizing
(4:36:54) marriage you're criticizing something else so maybe one of the mods want to leave that in the link in the description Dano or or vin or someone
(4:37:01) leave the link to this in the description Jim Bob's live so go over and no I I no we're gonna get to that

(4:37:13) I need to learn how to do these uh these raids though so guys uh made by Jim Bob go check him out he's live always
(4:37:18) entertaining he's obviously taking uh doing a take on the um the drama that's been happening with the whole wife Jack
(4:37:24) thing Mee Nick says it's simpy and then another guy who adopted kids said that
(4:37:30) it's not I don't I don't really know I don't really keep up to date with these dramas and everything to be honest guys
(4:37:35) I like to go feed the ducks in the morning if you see my Instagram Jake rnk I've been feeding the Ducks recently so
(4:37:41) I have better time doing that sort of stuff but I probably should uh watch
(4:37:48) um watch read some more of my hate mail and watch some more drama and everything rather than just feeding the Ducks all
(4:37:54) the time so uh you guys can see that Jim Bob the link is in uh the description
