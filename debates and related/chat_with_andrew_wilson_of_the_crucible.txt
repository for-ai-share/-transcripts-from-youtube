(0:25) Wednesday what is it march 26th uh today is going to be a hangout maybe
(0:32) uh some debate prep i'm debating feminism whether it's good for society
(0:38) so I I don't know how much prep there is needed i'm partnering with uh Jake
(0:44) Rattlesnake i will be streaming it here on this channel tomorrow
(0:51) 7:15 so uh that'll be fun
(0:58) um I don't even know how much there is to prep though i mean I'll probably make
(1:04) a big document or something but lay out the the
(1:11) problems there's actually deep philosophical issues with feminism which is uh my root attack on
(1:19) it but there are there are also just basic practical
(1:27) um issues as well as outcome issues with feminism ultimately it's based on a lie
(1:35) so that's one problem complete lie
(1:42) um you can't sustain a society with the notion of
(1:50) egalitarianism that's a problem you can't sustain a society without
(1:57) children that's a problem so it should be Who are we
(2:03) fighting i'm not even sure looks like Jay's going to be debating some chick some chicken
(2:11) head tonight jeff Bros welcome to Golden Folder how are you thank you so
(2:17) much set up my goal here and by all means if there's something
(2:23) you guys saw that you want me to bring up have some fun with it tell me let me
(2:28) know yesterday I was uh I didn't stream i was
(2:33) drawing i laid out a I wrote a an animation it's going to be
(2:40) fun and uh next Wednesday it looks like Wednesday my regular uh streaming time
(2:48) or at least somewhat regular we're shooting for 12:00 p.m mountain
(2:53) Standard Time we're going to do a full Mormonism stream so get
(3:05) excited anyh who how are you guys doing how the heck are you vgo John
(3:14) Castle Nasty Friles John Man Drag
(3:19) on how are you all doing do good good we good played a bunch of guitar yesterday
(3:27) started using this pick anyone Anyone in the chat use a pick uh thumb
(3:34) pick i didn't know how much I missed this pick cuz I kind of got lazy i was
(3:40) like "Well I'll just use my fingers." But got this bad boy back
(3:46) on it's quite fun to all my guitarists in the uh chat the challenge with this
(3:53) pick is I actually shorten it you could see my my little gross extended
(3:59) fingernail megan's totally grossed out by that uh but it is required for some
(4:04) thumb picking but the challenge with this pick is fingerpicking and then
(4:11) doing cross picking combination but once you get it
(4:16) down there's no going back those are too small that's funny
(4:22) you say that Chef because I actually trimmed this down the regular pick was about I don't
(4:30) know quarter at least a quarter inch longer than this i actually shaved it
(4:36) down so Joe Rogan cap did Joe Rogan have
(4:43) someone on is there anything is there anything to review honestly I mean I called this
(4:49) a feminist debate stream prep but I don't even know what there would be to prep now I don't
(4:56) want to get like cocky or anything but feminism is such a [ __ ] show
(5:05) i don't even know what to say oh your thumb's too big yeah you have You know what you do Chef you take
(5:12) the pick and you go to your uh coffee machine or
(5:17) or heat up some water boil some water and um let the boiling water sit for
(5:23) maybe 30 seconds and then throw the pick in wait I don't know 15 seconds 20
(5:31) seconds take it out and bend it bend it a little bit bigger and put
(5:37) it on your thumb and wait for it to cool down on your
(5:44) thumb look at Camille Leag i even disagree with
(5:50) her you know when I went through my classical liberal phase you know you know Tom Thomas
(5:56) uh Tom Soul and you know Ben Shapiro and all these
(6:02) people Camille Leaglia or whatever her name is she's always saying "Well they
(6:08) ruined it the modern feminist ruined it the original one was glorious." And that's not even true so even Camille is
(6:16) wrong andrew versus Tommy yeah that was uh he
(6:23) pretty much wrecked her you know because a lot of these
(6:28) conservative commentators well they probably know at this point they've probably seen enough of Andrew's stuff
(6:33) to know in advance but if they don't know they might assume that they're on each other's teams like "Oh cool the
(6:41) conservative the conservatives are going to wreck these liberals." And then then
(6:46) they're in for a rude awakening when Andrew turns on them as the covert
(6:53) feminists as he calls them and uh yeah she's she doesn't that kind of revealed
(7:03) uh that she is in fact just a classical liberal there there's nothing really
(7:10) rooted in her in her politics beyond just the superficial politics of like
(7:17) going against the left the leftards and they're always the same
(7:23) they're always like super done up and they're like you know the the quote the quote hot conservative you
(7:31) know they're Barbie they look like Barbies always
(7:38) but in the end they're just they're in a they're in a sense a type of
(7:46) liberal oh oh you know oh Daddy Crawford did a soy pod with Johnny Chang
(7:52) oh I can't handle Johnny Chang that guy's the worst
(7:58) i did see that Bryce Crawford did a a thing with that degenerate but I really
(8:04) don't want to I don't want to even hear or look at
(8:10) them i I don't want to What is his name adam 22 or whatever
(8:17) i don't know why we even give these people attention tread Thoughts yeah Tread
(8:23) Thoughts pretty much
(8:31) h I'm trying to look on my feed if there's anything that's funny worth
(8:37) reviewing cuz I mean who are we kidding we're going to go through the problems with feminism right now i mean I think I
(8:44) mistitled the stream honestly i don't even want to talk about
(8:51) feminism
(9:04) slow rain this is interesting that popped up on my YouTube slow the title
(9:09) is slow rain and banjo eight
(9:14) hours sounds awesome it's called Slow Banjo subscribe
(9:23) immediately slow banjo and rain that's genius genius look at that it is genius
(9:33) 717,000 views just in three months here slow rain and banjo 8 hours is the
(9:42) title gosh I love YouTube i really love it
(9:51) who am I eating well I was going to be debate prepping for I'm debating uh not
(9:56) so aerodite and some other feminist man
(10:02) tomorrow but uh I don't even want I don't even want to talk I don't even
(10:07) want to talk about it i don't even want to I don't even want to look at her
(10:16) i've seen enough uh footage of the aerodite chick especially from the early days of the
(10:24) Crucible and well actually I should look at the dude she's debating or who's
(10:30) debating with her that's Let's Let's do that let's do some responsible um
(10:38) oppositional research okay i don't want to get cocky don't get cocky kid
(10:51) what's his name i don't even know his name let's see what his name is [Music]
(10:58) um honestly I just want to I just want to ignore you all and listen to eight hours of rain and
(11:05) banjo that's what I want to do all right let's go to Sarah
(11:10) Tomatoes by the way Sarah Tomato if you're listening I'm going to give you an unsolicited
(11:18) tip um you got to consolidate all of your super chats because people send
(11:26) super chats because they want them read and a lot of times with the debate they want them read specifically to a
(11:32) specific person or a side so you have this habit of bringing up
(11:38) the super chats silently and letting the audience just kind of sort of read them
(11:43) and nobody if you do that there are a lot of people who are just not going to super chat because of that they're just
(11:49) going to be like what just sent 10 bucks and you just brought it on the screen but you didn't it wasn't like a moment
(11:58) you know you didn't make a moment out of it that's what people pay super chats for so can you stop doing
(12:05) that yeah you can call in dude um I'm on uh you can go to Discord let me see
(12:13) where are we at let's go to um you can go to the atheist
(12:19) um evolution server or part of my server there i'm in there right
(12:26) now yeah we can do that hey what better debate prep for feminism
(12:31) than having uh Andrew Andrew [ __ ] Wilson call
(12:42) in i got to still find this guy's name though who is he who is this
(12:48) person sarah Tomato who Who is this who
(12:53) are these people who am I even debating anymore
(12:59) no all right so Natso Aerodite and who is this team
(13:06) Harbog what who is Ken
(13:12) Harbo all right well we'll check some things he say he seems like a seems like
(13:19) a real woman simp that's what I think is happening
(13:25) was like a real real simpy guy see look tickytac says "For $5 nubs." Ticky Tac I
(13:33) thought you did a good job on that panel the other night even though I think you're [ __ ] for thinking we landed on the moon but
(13:39) whatever um Andrew are you there let me get you up on the on the screen here
(13:45) quick here we
(13:53) go effigy did you say effigy oh oh I I thought you were referring to that
(13:58) idiot you know that guy right all right who can you No I don't
(14:05) know a guy named Effigy you You've debated his name is animated effigy he's a real [ __ ] on uh on the
(14:12) panel in the panel verse oh well there's a lot of [ __ ] [ __ ] that Yeah yeah he's forgettable
(14:19) uh what's going on what the okay so I wanted to maybe give you a little insight into an easy
(14:28) uh like an easy cheat sheet to beat aerodite very quickly okay right
(14:34) so her focus is always on empiricism rather than philosophy because
(14:40) um well you know she's a like a social psychologist basically not really though
(14:46) she's not really a psychologist she's a psycho psych psychotic magician or whatever
(14:52) psychometrician um so what what they do basically is they just go over data and
(14:57) stats all day that's all they do right but the big exploit for her that's
(15:02) really easy is she's a dual set ethicist so um she she is a Christian who
(15:11) believes that Christian ethics do not apply to non-Christians and so she can never
(15:18) condemn any bad behavior from anybody who's not a Christian she can only condemn bad
(15:24) behavior from Christians interesting
(15:31) yeah um it's [ __ ] wild and even after being corrected on it multiple times
(15:39) um she has still doubled down on that position so because she's unwilling to
(15:44) yield any ground on that position mhm it's just like it's just like the
(15:50) ultimate cheat because this you just bring that up and then that's the end of the debate because she she she's
(15:56) unwilling to make any ought claims for condemnations of things which go against Christian ethics unless it's two
(16:03) Christians wow that's interesting because it sounds like correct me if I'm wrong if there's another angle to this
(16:08) but it sounds like the defeater is isn't it the case that a policy is a
(16:14) correction a type of correction for people it's an odd right yeah so so well
(16:20) not just that but the the other defeater is is like well then why would anybody want to become a Christian
(16:28) right if if there's no moral condemnation from Christians on what it is that you're doing wrong
(16:34) what is the incentive even for people to become Christians yeah that's a good point like um a conversion should people
(16:41) convert is a should claim and it's a correction isn't isn't a conversion repentance a correction so what is
(16:49) Christianity without correction and what's a conversion do you want people to be Christian and what what if
(16:56) Christianity requires repentance repentance from what yeah exactly if they can't be corrected
(17:02) yeah there's no incorrect uh form uh that they're in right yeah so if they
(17:08) only need to repent if they are Christians that's a big problem right uh
(17:13) because the whole point of the conversion is that they're supposed to come and repent for all of the sins they did whether they were Christians or not
(17:19) Christians right does she believe this or did she use this as a sort of a meme operation against you specifically she
(17:25) not only she not only believes it but she is now heavily invested in it
(17:32) wow yeah because she she was completely unwilling to back off on the position
(17:38) she was just totally unwilling to there was hours and hours of of uh theologians
(17:43) calling in and correcting her and she later came out and said well she had Catholic priests which is not true but
(17:50) she she claimed this that Catholic priests even called her and told her that she was right that Oh right yeah
(17:56) that the ethical status only you know is only for the Catholics so the reason why
(18:01) this is so important is because she refuses to condemn sex work condemn Only Fans condemn prostitution condemn
(18:09) homosexuality she she refuses to condemn any of those things and she says that the reason she doesn't is because
(18:17) morality only exists for them if they become Christians otherwise it doesn't and so you have no business correcting
(18:22) it yeah sounds like she's taken a a truth that does exist even within orthodoxy that we're more rigorous with
(18:29) people in the church obviously when we're approaching them than people outside but doesn't follow that you that
(18:36) they just it's like a free pass on society itself uh it sounds like she's just making a leap right well it's not
(18:44) just that but the the rigors and orthodoxy are not even designed to hold
(18:50) you to a bigger standard it's it's designed around the belief that
(18:55) um if you're spreading false theology right you are actually assisting people
(19:01) in their damnation right and so correct correcting you
(19:06) um takes precedent right because uh if you're if you're spouting the
(19:12) wrong theology then you actually um are moving people into into perhaps a worse
(19:19) condition Mhm than if they if they weren't believers at all right yeah um
(19:25) and so this topic if she goes here this will only come up as a response to some metaethical attack which is my it's like
(19:34) one of my specialties but this debate feminism itself as you've demonstrated as a debate um sometimes you don't even
(19:41) need to go to the larger philosophical angles uh even though they're you know worthy of pursue uh it seems like just
(19:49) basically it's really easy to it's really easy to get her on this by just bringing up that is Christianity a
(19:55) patriarchal religion and should people follow it right and if she she says they
(20:02) should follow it but it's not a patriarchal religion that's it that's that's the end of that whole debate
(20:08) right right the whole thing is done because okay well uh was Christ a
(20:14) patriarch or Mhm you know and then you know well he's gender fluid or something
(20:20) yeah there's a see where she goes yeah whatever stupid [ __ ] they come up with but they
(20:27) um they usually have to make the concession uh feminists who also claim
(20:32) uh Christianity usually have to make the concession that it is a patriarchal religion and so it's a contradiction in
(20:40) terms because feminism necessarily is trying to dismantle patriarchal systems to make them egalitarian systems right
(20:46) right yeah you're like okay well can can women be priests and she'll be like yeah
(20:52) can women you know what I mean so they just and it's like well then it's you're really saying it's not a patriarchal
(20:59) religion right you know so it's a it's a
(21:04) pretty easy conflict that you can easily exploit is all I'm saying no that's a good angle i didn't know that about her
(21:10) specifically that she tried to do this like weird crappy Christian thing
(21:18) yeah the clip the clip's on my channel if you um if you want to watch it in Ale or it's on Alex PWF's as well when I get
(21:24) into it with her even Destiny shut up he was like "Oh [ __ ] this is stupid." She she was like uhoh so um yeah that's a
(21:34) that's a really easy one right and it's a it's a a massive conflict in her
(21:40) worldview and she just hates touching on it because she can't reconcile it she just can't reconcile why do you think uh
(21:47) she doubles down on it if she is she's just dumb and doesn't realize she shouldn't do that or No aerodite's one
(21:55) of those chicks like many women who she would you know they're always praised as
(22:01) being the smart girl in class right because they have the unique ability to regurgitate information but they they
(22:10) don't have a unique ability to contextualize what they regurgitate yeah it also makes her a little different
(22:15) than a general secularist like uh femot you know like oh you're you you have
(22:22) some virtue corner here that you can you can hold to kind of gets you yeah it's
(22:27) like an optic thing yeah well she considers she considers orthodoxy to be Sadducees and she
(22:35) considers orthodoxy to be a faux religion right um but when when pressed
(22:41) right she also moves over to a Roman Catholic position which is [ __ ] hilarious and you can just point out
(22:47) like okay can women be popes and it's like no oh okay well that
(22:54) sounds an awful lot like a patriarchy doesn't it like so only men can be at the top of
(23:01) this hierarchy mhm yeah oh okay well that's a patriarchy so
(23:07) I'm not sure how you support that exactly i mean the whole Yeah the whole
(23:12) top down structure is patriarchal you know yeah that's actually a really good point it's not
(23:18) just the philosophy she's going to espouse but you have to tie the the view
(23:23) the Christian view even her shitty version to some sort of authority and if you call that authority the church and
(23:30) she agrees that Christ is a high priest of this thing called the church um and
(23:36) and everything and and if she says that society uh should ultimately reflect or
(23:42) be some extension of the church that would be a good a good goal to have she's pretty much toast right because um
(23:50) well yeah well and you can ask some really basic questions that are pretty brutal too you can just ask like why did
(23:56) Christ incarnate as a man right why why was that purpose yeah
(24:04) you know what was Are you saying that uh that there was a mistake that was made or Yeah yeah or take a redeem Zoomer
(24:12) approach where it could have been anything could have been a Yeah it could have been anything well even even Right
(24:17) and that's even that's even worse right it's even worse and and uh and dumber i
(24:23) don't even think she'll say that i think just she'll just give you gobblely goop you know what I mean just just gobbley goop that's untenable
(24:30) but it's a it's a contradiction in the worldview so you'll you'll see this a
(24:36) lot with feminist Christians right when you when you dive into the worldview and just ask about the patriarchal nature of
(24:43) Christianity itself their ability to reconcile it is like 0%
(24:49) yeah and it's not even a common They just don't know how to Yeah and it's not common enough especially in the
(24:54) mainstream like it you know patriarchy is just a meme that you engage with or
(25:00) not but hardly ever people are talking about well if you're holding a general even a general Christian or conservative
(25:07) view that's tied to a general Christian view and you attack this problem of uh
(25:13) egalitarianism in contrast to uh a patriarchy or like explicit patriarchy
(25:19) um they don't know where to go it's you it's probably just not brought up because you can't really cover it in sound bites i bet you know that quickly
(25:27) um well for her the the definition too she'll quibble on it and that's fine
(25:34) like I would I would let her quibble quibble on it i would just um cuz if you say feminism is the movement towards
(25:40) egalitarian structures and the deconstruction of patriarchy mhm um she'll she'll probably quibble and say
(25:46) "Well I'm not for deconstructing the patriarchy or I'm not for getting rid of the patriarchy." But you can just kind
(25:53) of really point out the obvious which is "Okay so then you support the patriarchy."
(25:59) And if she says "No I don't." You just be like "Well then then you know like what's the
(26:07) actual position here you just are you just neutral on the patriarchy?" Mhm yeah you know and and she'll have to be
(26:14) like "Well no not really." And like when they try to quibble about that I'm not for getting
(26:20) rid of the patriarchy you're like "Oh okay well then you do you support it?" It's like "No no I don't actually
(26:25) support it either." They just don't want to depend on the definition of their view right i mean how else like how many
(26:33) other ways can someone try to move against the patriarchy the definition of feminism including antithesis to
(26:40) patriarchy how else could they do it i haven't If there's if if feminism is um
(26:48) is the view of freeing yourself from oppression who are you being oppress oppressed by other women right and
(26:56) they'll say no okay well that only leaves one other possibility unless you're like being oppressed by monkeys
(27:03) or apes or something weird you know but there's only the only possibility
(27:08) that I can think of for an oppressor oppressed relationship between men and
(27:13) women is that it has to either be men or it has to either be women right like what else what else can it be
(27:21) so and then I assume she also takes a general like liberation position that
(27:27) autonomy and all all the rest that follows as her second position yeah yeah she's pro she's pro-choice uh
(27:35) pro-LGBTQ she's pro prorans pro I mean pro everything when it comes to uh woke
(27:42) ideology she's on the forefront of that as well so Mhm um she she can be
(27:47) reasonable but just remember that she hides her positions like she hides them you got to drag them out
(27:53) and um so I mean the first thing I would do is drag the positions out and one of
(27:59) the first things she'll say is like I don't want to do a metaethical debate and you could be you can just agree to that and not do one okay but still get
(28:05) the definitions of these things under control quickly you know right well also if she says
(28:12) that I could say okay that's fair we'll we'll discuss all of these topical things but um to you know if you do make
(28:18) an odd claim about society and how it should operate is you know can I at least call out that that's a metaethical
(28:24) position cuz honestly you can't escape meta ethics but I understand what what's meant by that you don't want to go deep
(28:30) into the phil philosophical sledge the phil the philosophy well one one thing
(28:35) you point out to is like well look uh if you're just wanting to move towards a
(28:40) more egalitarian society if men are the current ones who are in charge of that
(28:46) society how is that not you wanting to deconstruct patriarchy
(28:51) and I think she'll have to kind of concede that it is right yeah and if you were if you did want to I think you're
(28:58) right she's probably just going to stay try to stay as neutral as possible and not make any big claims like we should
(29:03) do this or that but even if she said "Yeah well maybe we should explore um
(29:09) society being run by more women or something." You go I would just ask how is it you're going going to accomplish
(29:15) that like what's the how are you actually going to make that happen practically because right around the
(29:21) corner to that claim is the is the uh the force doctrine and application
(29:27) that's right there like there's no way you can do it without relying on the thing that's against your view like
(29:34) every time well another thing another thing that's really fun to do with the
(29:39) uh the egalitarian types the like u you know more more autonomy more equality
(29:46) types is just is just say okay for every claim you make for what X group should have I need to know what the equal claim
(29:54) is for what the other group is getting what are they getting which equalizes
(30:00) this right and they can never actually tell you how it equals itself out right
(30:07) so if you're like if you're removing men from power what are they getting yeah that's that was my angle with voting and
(30:13) it still needed to be cleaned up a little bit i ran that by you when I debated Rob which was uh something like
(30:19) the act of voting for a man is a sort of tradeoff from using their their force
(30:24) like collectivizing their force in the here now and they're saying "I'll participate in this voting bullshit."
(30:30) And it's an expression of outsourcing the monopoly of force to the state okay
(30:36) the the alternative is no I'm not going to vote i'm going to do this i'm going to I'm going to gather my men and my my
(30:42) force and try to make something happen and if if the vote for a man is the is
(30:48) the trade of using their force I'm not sure what the woman is trading like you
(30:53) know like the the rhetoric is uh they're just tra what they're not going to gossip as much like you know what I mean
(30:59) like what are they going to do what's the tradeoff for for even a woman well I think the easy the easy
(31:06) affirmative position uh to take is just to say like look necessarily society has
(31:13) to be defended and necessarily society's defenders are going to be men mhm that's
(31:19) they're they have to take that role because women are just not capable of that role yeah so that's the case that's
(31:26) a that's a pivotal duty that men have and you can quibble and say some women can participate in some aspects of that
(31:33) duty and you can you can just kind of grant it and say yeah that's true but um
(31:38) but if they have this duty to society then what are what's you know what is
(31:44) women's duty none right from that is the well just that is the equivalent to that
(31:50) you never ask them what the duty is cuz they'll say [ __ ] like be a nice person yeah right yeah you have to ask but
(31:57) that's but that's an equal duty right so men and women both have to do that yeah yeah so you what you're asking is what
(32:03) is the duty that women have that is on par with this duty that men have for to
(32:10) to be the societal protectors is to make would you say that if they were smart
(32:16) enough they might say um um making ch children raising children
(32:22) and we'll protect but that but that would so but that would destroy the leftist view right so the second you say
(32:29) women have a duty to have children right that Well that just destroys the entire
(32:36) purpose of women's liberation to begin with yeah yeah which is elimination of the duty to have children and be part of
(32:44) this patriarchal manscape and this and that yeah if they were smart they would
(32:49) say well to to the duty that's on par with that is we're the reproducers of society and was we have a duty to do
(32:56) that but they'll never say that and so they can never come up with an actual
(33:01) duty that's on par with that because the obvious one right the the obvious one
(33:06) which is what gives us the incentive to protect society mhm is that they have children yeah have children yeah that's
(33:13) the equivalent from what their nature is to what a man's nature is yeah to what a man's nature is so So because they never
(33:20) say that right you can you can deliver this tactic to a feminist uh endlessly
(33:27) and there's they have zero defense against it it doesn't matter how educated they are how educated they're
(33:33) not there is zero defense and the thing that's funny is they can say "Well not
(33:38) all men can protect." And you can just kind of respond and say "Well not all women can give child birth." Right right
(33:45) not all women can give a child can can can have children either but we would treat them in the same class protection
(33:50) as those that could because that's still their duty just like you need to treat men in the same class protection of
(33:56) protectors as men uh even if they can't for you know various reasons of
(34:02) disability and this and that so I mean it's just it's a total defeater yeah it's not only a duty uh but it would be
(34:09) a logical and practical necessity so even if someone said not all men can defend uh the same way it would still
(34:16) require men generally collectively to defend like in the end and same with women it requires women to have a child
(34:23) like it's not going to have children even even if all women can't have children it's still it's the necessary
(34:30) entailment that only women can yeah yeah and it's the same thing with the protection of the nation while it's true
(34:37) that not all men can do this it is an entailment that only men can so um that
(34:43) you know that's that's it that's the end of the of the argument essentially so when people are talking about gender
(34:49) roles and they have they have trouble like identifying well you know these
(34:54) gender roles are social constructs and this and that and it's like well I guess in a sense that's true right but also
(35:01) there are some practical truths that are inescapable which is that the defense of your nation and the enforcement of its
(35:07) laws are going to be done by men right period that it's going to be done by the
(35:13) stronger sect um and and you can only protect from the stronger sex with the
(35:20) stronger sex so if you want a society in which men protect women protect women's rights protect women uh from being you
(35:28) know raped and um you know exploited and things like this then I would agree with
(35:34) you that that's a duty that men should have what's the equivalent that women have right and just watch them implode
(35:40) they just implode yeah do you think that being that the topic is is feminism good
(35:46) for society without getting into meta about what good means i've noticed that
(35:51) in all of the debates that are happening uh with secularists this Christian vers secularist um meme that's happening um
(35:59) when we go to duties they're pretty much done like cuz there's no duties under secularism and feminism is very similar
(36:06) so when we uh don't we set up isn't it best for Jake and I to set up before
(36:12) that argument Andrew uh to set up to see if we can get the them to affirm that is
(36:18) what's good for society let's say we just grant you what's good your definition is it necessary that that
(36:24) society then take on obligations to defend what you think is good isn't that
(36:30) a necessary component like even if we granted what they think is good just for the sake of the argument Is that
(36:36) necessary as a preliminary step or is that just like implied in the argument you think
(36:43) um I I mean I think that um that laying it out is still a good idea even if
(36:50) people come to it anyway because there's no escaping it yeah i still think that laying out like look do people have any
(36:57) kind of duty to society and they'll just say that there's a some kind of bizarre shared duty which is revolves around
(37:04) like being nice and having goodwill and helping homeless homeless bums get a sandwich or whatever the [ __ ] it is
(37:10) right that they'll say is a shared duty but they'll never say that there's a gender specific duty right ever or in
(37:18) this case a sex specific duty like no Men don't need to be the protectors
(37:25) right which is hilarious because descriptively they do and prescriptively they do right like I I I think you could
(37:34) maybe make a prescription where women took all of the uh law enforcement
(37:40) military uh intelligence and etc etc roles um but your nation would just get
(37:47) steamrolled in like a week right so who cares yeah or they might go to robots they might go to robots hypothetically
(37:54) but that that has a it's still men servicing and and making all the [ __ ]
(37:59) carrying yeah but even if it is the case that in the future um well I would I would point this out i would just point
(38:06) out like if it is the case that you think robots are going to be there to secure women's rights what happens if we
(38:12) have a robot that allows for men to reproduce without women what do you think happens to women's rights then
(38:20) right so what you're doing then is you're you're making a comparison saying
(38:25) what happens if we have the irrational uh the consistently irrational and the
(38:32) consistent uh type of human that has hormone imbalances high mental illness
(38:37) and is weaker than the other human who uh focuses on rationality doesn't have
(38:44) trouble with hormone regulation and is much stronger so what happens in this in
(38:49) this distinction when we introduce robots is that the very thing you think liberates women actually ends up
(38:56) enslaving them because when men if men had control over reproduction Mhm absent
(39:01) needing to enslave women for it then what what then wouldn't they select for
(39:07) men right yeah well that's what they did in China that's what they did in China
(39:13) and that's what they've always done when there's scarcity of children they select for men right right and that's what's
(39:19) funny about the meme they always bring up uh Handmaid's Tail and they try to blame that on some sort of like they try
(39:25) to make that like a like a religious thing where it's like it's actually the opposite that kind of reality would be
(39:32) more more the result of a secular and feminist approach um where you would
(39:37) produce SC you know the the the view itself and the practice actually reduces
(39:43) procreation would cause the enslavement of women uh for procreation uh from a
(39:48) Christian view especially even Islamic view which I think that that tale was kind of nodding to correct me if I'm
(39:55) wrong but even them there's no there's no shortage of of of the view and the
(40:01) practice of procreating like within Christianity or a variety of other religious beliefs but in feminism
(40:08) secularism in general if they go that route where it's like you really want a society which enslaves women have it's
(40:15) like uh that's that's actually the going to be the result of your view not ours
(40:21) that's actually No it's Well it's even it's even worse um not just result of
(40:26) But when you say when they say "Do you want a society which enslaves women and
(40:32) and turns them into breeding mares?" You're like "Well no of course not." But the very technologies that you're
(40:38) banking on for liberation likely would be the technologies which phase women out completely from
(40:44) society what need in other words if men if if there's artificial wombs and men
(40:50) have the ability to reproduce absent women why wouldn't they select in their
(40:57) reproduction cycle for more men right and that's not the same reversed right because some people say well they
(41:03) figured out there's what what's the funny meme like there's there's sperm in bones or something and they can
(41:08) impregnate themselves through a bone or something like that um they always say well we can freeze a bunch of sperm well
(41:15) that still requires men but let's say we gave you the the optimal amount for sperm that granted you like a 10,000
(41:22) years or something like this you It's We're still back to how do you manage
(41:28) and defend and enforce society itself you know a bunch of chicks right like
(41:33) that's you're still back to well in the here now right here and now when you
(41:38) have a society that is bound by laws and bound by an an order a system um and and
(41:46) when someone goes against that system you actually need to intervene with brute force what do you you know who
(41:52) cares if we gave all the sperm in the world it pre it also it also presupposes
(41:58) that men go along with it so the thing is is like you can make the argument
(42:03) that well maybe men will just go along with this but that's the thing is that you have to make the argument that maybe
(42:09) they'll go along with it women can't make the argument that they just won't go along with it
(42:15) they don't have a choice right yes so they can't force they can't force
(42:22) you to go along with it but you can force them to go along with it right right so the distinction in conversation is always distinct and
(42:30) different right it's like yeah maybe you could convince us to go along with this manless future right but we don't have
(42:37) to convince you of a of a female free uh uh future we can just force it
(42:45) yeah speaking of force enslaved by Truth who's a huge fan of yours Andrew um Byzantine Society was very patriarchal
(42:53) but also had very influential powerful women even female emperors i would correct you on that enslaved by Truth i
(42:58) you could say influence but to say powerful I would disagree now I know
(43:04) you're using uh powerful in a colloquial sense but what we're actually talking about is they those women had no power
(43:10) even if they had influence the influence would be reliant on the actual force and the power of men so what is influence
(43:18) sure there's influence me women can influence men especially weak men um they can they can manipulate they're
(43:24) good at manipulating but in the end um what is influence without without that
(43:31) budding uh brute force well this is the main the one of the primary
(43:36) anti-suffragette arguments I read out last night uh or the night before I don't remember which but yeah night
(43:42) before was the anti-suffragette said "Look it's not that we're a nations of
(43:48) of laws right is that we're a nation of law enforcement and enforcement is always
(43:55) going to come from men women can't enforce their own rights right that's the idea it is true that you can have
(44:02) women who are in positions of authority via the consent of men um nobody's
(44:08) disputing that what is in disputes is that women can do anything about the conditionals for themselves without men
(44:16) whereas men can do things uh about the conditionals for them without women yes
(44:22) yeah it's not the Yeah yeah it's not that's the distinction when you're
(44:27) talking about force doctrine so um nobody is even making the argument that there can't be powerful women or women
(44:34) in charge of things nobody's ever made or that there can't be female soldiers or that there can't be women who do this
(44:39) but you always think that the exception the somehow disproves the rule with the here the exception proves the rule right
(44:47) that everywhere in history from the historic standard not one time have women liberated themselves from anything
(44:55) but the amount of times that men have liberated themselves from conditionals that they don't like is astronomical
(45:01) right in fact it's not it's not it's not a some case use it's an all case use
(45:06) yeah and even the opposite even the opposite because we're always talking about liberation like that's the good
(45:12) like li you know that's seen as the good liberate yourself from these from evil forces and all this stuff but it's
(45:18) actually true also that me it's men who are capable of it of enslaving people as
(45:24) well which is just as powerful as as being as uh forcefully using force to liberate yourself those two are always
(45:32) kind of battling each other where women they have neither they can't liberate
(45:37) anyone and they also can't enslave anyone and you know correct yeah so those they can't do they they well they
(45:44) can't do either of those things absent the force of men yeah so they can whisper to it's Yeah it's always an
(45:52) intrinsic reliance on the force of men don't you think that because
(45:57) historically also there's been uh women who use their seduction and you know show their boobies to make men powerful
(46:05) men weak and then you know that could give them some influence of the the the
(46:10) arm of force that that person has whether it's historical or today is that why they're so easily sold on sexual
(46:16) liberation cuz that is they know that in a sense that is kind of their power um
(46:22) it's just that they're misusing it is that what what's happening is like because that's what I see they're like
(46:27) misusing really so historically historically seduction is not one-sided
(46:33) like there are powerful queens who were seduced by men as well so seduction is
(46:39) not just a peculiar um it's not Yeah it's not just exclusive to women right
(46:45) it is a tool that they're generally better at because they they can't appeal the force but men seduce just as easily
(46:53) right they just seduce in different ways they may not sexually seduce but they they seduce people with um Yeah
(47:00) delusions delusions of grandeur with you know things like that that's all seduction yeah epste Epstein was a
(47:07) seduction a what would you call the male seductress a seducer he was a seducer
(47:13) yeah he was a seducer uh and I that actually might be more effective when
(47:18) the male seduces the male with the things of the world and whatever else their dreams are like it's always the
(47:25) the guy saying "Well I'm going to I'm going to make your dreams come true." It's not really the women saying that to
(47:31) men they're saying "I'll make your fantasies come true." Maybe but they never they're never the men saying "I'm
(47:36) going to make your your your dreams of power and influence come true." It's
(47:42) women aren't generally saying that to men no not generally so that but that's
(47:48) the um what they're what they're doing is they're doing an a body exchange that
(47:53) is the material of the world that they would use as a as a form of currency and men may seduce with money or power or
(48:01) influence or and they also seduce women often with the idea of power money and
(48:06) influence all you have to do is look at how many women have [ __ ] destiny right right they're definitely not doing that
(48:11) because they find him highly attractive and charismatic as opposed to the men who found Destiny
(48:18) right rather they they are willing to uh to do this in exchange for some type of
(48:24) power and influence and and this kind of thing right but none of this really uh
(48:30) negates the fact that the appeal to force is always going to be through men never through women right and women will
(48:37) always necessarily have to appeal to men for force for force doctrine like there's just there's just it's inescapable and that's why society
(48:44) always be a patriarchy because you necessarily will have to appeal to men of authority who who wield force right
(48:52) and I would argue that men who wield the maximum amount of force have the most authority and our founders clearly
(48:59) agreed because they put the president of the United States in charge of the armed forces of the United States so they were clearly saying his authority is backed
(49:05) up with the greatest use of force do you think men who uh understand that uh
(49:13) force is primary primarily men uh holding a feminist position do you think
(49:18) they're they're in an an actual performative contradiction or or it's
(49:23) not an actual performative contradiction to say well I'm holding force because that's a male thing but I'm going to
(49:30) present this feminist egalitarian view um I just want to know because if I use
(49:35) that in a debate and it's not an actual performative contradiction I don't want to say that it is but it is an interesting um sort of dichotomy uh that
(49:46) people still assume force there's always men in power and they're like we're going to use this power to make this
(49:52) like sort of like fake Sims version of society that that's egalitarian and it's
(49:58) all luxury it's all decadence it's like it's like them being on a stage they're making a stage for society to be like
(50:04) "Well oh let's pretend that we're all equal." But really they know that that that's not the case it's not it's not
(50:10) equal at all the the the agreed two terms will determine if it's a contradiction or not if the agreed two
(50:17) terms are that patriarchy is sex plus authority right so your sex is male and
(50:24) you're in positions of authority over men and women therefore it's a patriarchy mhm and I don't really know
(50:31) how you can define it absent that a patriarch right is going to be authority
(50:37) plus male right that's going to be a patriarch like what else could a patriarch be other than that
(50:44) so if they if they determine that that is what a patriarch is and then you say
(50:49) well you need to appeal to other patriarchs essentially men who have authority uh over force in order to do
(50:57) something about this then that would be a contradiction because then you're just basically replacing one patriarchy with
(51:02) another patriarchy maybe that's the whole trun thing is like they know the patriarchy thing is true and so they
(51:08) just changed the definition of man to include females and the females are now a part of the patriarchy so the next
(51:15) phase for them is to affirm the patriarchy but just include females as
(51:20) as men and just call them men and in power right i could see that happening in the I mean it's already happening in
(51:27) the military in a sense like you get these these uh you know transformers
(51:33) taking on these positions of office inside the military and and the females
(51:38) who are acting like men are you know they're really like believing that they're in this like office of power as
(51:44) a man but they're not a man they're not really a man they're not even close to a man but they think it they're they're
(51:51) kind of laring it um well there's It's greater there's easier contradictions to put them in like for instance they'll
(51:59) tell you that yeah they completely and totally rely on men for protection that that is their role in society cuz that
(52:04) one's pretty inescapable but then also at the same time they'll tell you how incompetent men are and how worthless
(52:10) they are you know what I mean how they can't they can't do anything they can't fix a doororknob they can't you know
(52:16) what I mean they can't do anything they're totally incompetent it's like so at the same time they're saying they're
(52:22) completely reliant on this sex at the same time they're ridiculing it for being incompetent it's like well uh then
(52:29) why would you rely on it for security if it's that incompetent right well I guess
(52:35) I guess maybe it's not as incompetent you know what I mean like it just round and round and round it goes but it's
(52:40) really hard for for the feminist mind it's very difficult to get over this arch so early feminist writers talked
(52:47) about uh many many many times how to get through the idea of force doctrine and
(52:53) they just they never could quite reconcile it so now you have modern feminists who say things like "Look one
(52:59) of the reasons that we need to put all this [ __ ] in the food that people eat is because it lowers testosterone right we
(53:04) want testosterone lowered we want men less aggressive." Right so I mean they they literally will poison the well not
(53:11) just proverbally but physically if they can get away with it yeah that makes sense try to equalize cuz they're they
(53:18) never elevate woman to man they have to lower man in all their different ways to woman yes to woman yeah they can't they
(53:26) can't they can't figure out and that's why they all bank on this transhumanist future where the rise of the machines is
(53:32) going to equalize somehow equalize men and women and it's like well we've been in the industrial age for an awful long
(53:39) time and this equalization in force has just not occurred and you should also beware of the
(53:46) transhumanist future again because the artificial womb then gives the patriarchy complete power right there's
(53:52) like what what your bartering tool is gone right yeah that's wild to think
(53:57) about they think it's the opposite right but it's it's the worst for them then they have no that's the thing that
(54:04) they're guarding that's why um a Christian view uh with everything including the virtue of virginity and
(54:11) chastity and protecting and valuing your body as a woman as as the the the gates
(54:16) of procreation that if that's gone they're gonna all these [ __ ] feminists are going to think they've
(54:22) scored and it's just the complete opposite i mean that's Well it's what's really funny is that you can you can
(54:29) easily make the argument that Christianity and even Islam fundamentally would be better for the
(54:35) procurement of women's rights than the transhumanist future of the machine that they envision because both would be
(54:41) diametrically opposed to the artificial womb right both both views are going to
(54:47) say the artificial womb is bad and that birth should be done the natural way
(54:53) through men through husbands and wives right that actually procures more power for women in society to be viewed as
(54:59) matrons and be viewed as high status people than if reproduction is completely replaced with artificial
(55:06) wombs then it just becomes transactional for their eggs like it is for men with their sperm right it just becomes
(55:13) transactional at that point so then it's like well and men are going to select
(55:18) for what they're going to select for more men than and we know this because we can look at every society where there
(55:24) was child scarceness they always selected for men in China they selected for men why well because one men are
(55:32) easier to raise and two the you you're taking out a lot of
(55:40) what um society men society men and women see as imperfections so
(55:45) imperfection one is the emotional and hormonal regulation men just don't have
(55:52) the same problems with that that women do they just don't have it it's not a thing which is which is except for that
(55:59) guy who debated on Pierce Morgan recently i mean he was a little Yeah well but even even those people they
(56:06) have to pretend like the second he saw like the second that guy saw that uh
(56:12) that I wasn't going to give any ground and I was going to make fun of him for being a crying [ __ ] and [ __ ] like that he began shifting his attitude quickly
(56:19) he was like "I gotta be a man now." Yeah yeah yeah i gotta be a man now right okay this this pretending [ __ ] doesn't
(56:25) work right so the thing is is like even those people the fact that he could
(56:30) rationalize that as quickly as he did again it just shows that the more control over hormonal regulation it's
(56:37) not that women can't be rational logical they can it's not that women are stupid they're not it's just to say that uh
(56:45) between the strength strength differential and hormone regulation right you're probably if you have to
(56:51) select for one child you're probably going to select a man a male mhm here's
(56:56) a good question like you're you're you're getting a stronger less hormonal version of a human being
(57:02) that's easier to raise and is probably going to contribute to your family in a much more much more dynamic way and if
(57:09) you could say well wait you want daughters because they'll create a lot of heirs for you right um which is also
(57:15) true but if if sex selection now is done by an artificial womb you just don't
(57:20) need that you know yeah uh there's a good there's a good question bobby C says "For $5 if all political power is
(57:27) backed by male force then is there an actual problem with female political power or is that just preferential?" Uh
(57:34) Andrew I'll let you answer that and in fact I have no problem whoring you out uh if you guys while we have them uh
(57:40) want to ask Andrew a question you can pay me money to ask him a question um but that question I think you did answer
(57:47) uh but you can answer it again is it an actual problem uh to have a female political power
(57:55) yeah well I think I I a problem in the sense that it's an illusion um and that
(58:02) they the backing of the power structure is again just men allowing this but if
(58:08) men decide to not allow this they don't have power anymore and there's nothing
(58:13) they can do about it they can't collectively appeal to other women to enforce their power
(58:18) yeah but men can collect can can uh collectively appeal to men to enforce
(58:24) theirs and women can collectively appeal to men to enforce theirs but either way you're still going to appeal to men and
(58:31) so men ultimately are always going to be the driving authority in society whether
(58:36) whether you like it or not yeah even if it was like demonstrated that like a
(58:41) woman I don't know if this is a myth or not but there was a dude named Howard Bloom who argued that women there is
(58:48) some historical I don't know if this is true or not historical um claims that uh
(58:53) women were often influential in sort of uh managing at least not leading necessarily but like managing uh
(59:01) assassination squads and these things like I don't even know if that's true but let's let's just say it is true um
(59:07) what you're saying is It wouldn't even matter if they were really good at something it's not obvious that they
(59:13) would be suddenly permitted just because they're good at it it would still be at the mercy of the collective of men in
(59:19) this context yeah it's always going to be it's always going to be at the mercy of even a small collective of men you
(59:25) know the entire revolutionary war was fought with a very small uh portion of the of the um demographic of men very
(59:33) very small but that's all you need like if if 1% of the male population wants
(59:38) something to happen it's just a a [ __ ] to to stop that thing from
(59:44) happening you know what I mean because they can they can inflict the thing the ultimate kind of thing right which is
(59:51) death they can just inflict it on you so So you know you it's it's a it's a thing
(59:57) that is not to be easily trifled with right um but yeah so I mean the the
(1:00:03) force appeal is always like "Well but can't you have female politicians at the consent of of male collectives?" And
(1:00:09) it's like "Yeah sure." Yeah of course you can but who I'd never forget who's
(1:00:14) really in charge yeah is it a Was that a myth i mean you would know that better than me uh historically were there
(1:00:21) actually women oh no oh yeah there were tons especially like even the Japanese
(1:00:26) uh the the ninja who were assassins they often had females in brothel who would
(1:00:31) be poisoners so I mean women traditionally have uh have operated in assassin roles as poisoners and things
(1:00:38) like that not as like they don't jump out of the shadows with a mask on and stab you because they're passive right
(1:00:45) they could sneak in and they're elegant yeah yeah yeah yeah they poison you like they they've traditionally been the
(1:00:51) king's poisoners yeah and or they can get on top of you i mean if if you wanted to have sex if you were weak and
(1:00:58) you wanted to have sex with a woman and you didn't think ahead it's it's quite possible she can kill you you know
(1:01:04) during that yeah but they really didn't do that either they really almost universally just poisoned you know women
(1:01:11) were poisoners and that's what they did i mean kings had poisoners and uh and
(1:01:16) yeah they often were women that's pretty and now and they still do that they just use words now right
(1:01:23) well well no they actually use still use literal poison too i mean there's there's the tons of cases of women who
(1:01:30) poison their husbands i mean that's there was one Yeah there's one just recently where she
(1:01:36) was pouring bleach in his coffee and it's like um so I mean yeah they they still they still poison like that that
(1:01:43) hasn't gone away in fact there was a Tik Tok trend recently of a bunch of witches talking about a specific type of
(1:01:50) undetectable poison you could mix for the men in your life so yeah it's like that I mean that's
(1:01:57) true for sure that assassination protocols for for poisoning which was
(1:02:02) very very very common place remember it was not an easy thing to detect you know
(1:02:09) um we we they didn't have autopsies the same way hundreds of years ago so yeah
(1:02:14) poisoning was uh was part of the order of the day yeah enslave truth says "Why is the queen so powerful in chess
(1:02:20) feminism checkmate." Well no the game's over when the king dies not when the queen dies um they are they are very
(1:02:27) useful though in the game that's for sure um uh let me Someone said now that
(1:02:33) I think of it um both says a modern woman just Well well hang on but I want
(1:02:39) I want to kind of point something out here right which is that um if the queen
(1:02:46) is called the queen do we assume every other chess piece is male because if that's the case would you
(1:02:53) would you ever start that game with just the queen when I had all my pieces
(1:03:00) right right yeah so the thing is is like um again
(1:03:07) it's it would still appear that force doctrine is in the hands of uh of the men on the board doesn't it even in
(1:03:14) chess um even in chess uh let me see someone says uh we should bring back
(1:03:19) duels a woman gets yappy their father and husband get get challenged and you have it out yeah I think you could still
(1:03:26) do duels even without death and it would be pretty entertaining um
(1:03:31) uh what's this person say uh for woke feminists and progressives who try to shame who you voted for in the election
(1:03:38) they need to remember is Jesus is king i think you said unfortunately my super chats don't show um glad to see you back
(1:03:46) tan Bob hope the vacation was great it was Yeah it was excellent um uh both
(1:03:51) says "Now that I think of it a modern woman just can't bring themselves to say women ought to have children it's
(1:03:57) insane." Yeah we're at that point look look they can't they can't put this on themsel well progressive women can't so
(1:04:04) Christian women will often say it's a duty um it's a duty to bear children but
(1:04:09) the sewing circle progressive feminist Christians what they will say is that
(1:04:15) they have a duty if they choose right they have a duty if they choose so it
(1:04:22) all it always just becomes there there is no duty and so if they want it defined they're like "So what does that
(1:04:28) mean that women should just be popping out as many babies as possible for as many men and you just be like "No of course not it's ridiculous." Um we're
(1:04:35) just saying that society should be moving in such a way where this this as a duty to the nation and to create
(1:04:44) better families and things like this should be prioritized at the top of how we um we lay down our ethics to the
(1:04:52) public now you can call that propaganda hell yeah propaganda because you know you can call that propaganda if you want
(1:04:59) to but the truth is is like you're not saying that women must do this right
(1:05:04) you're just saying that this is a duty which falls squarely on them and that for the sake of society they probably
(1:05:10) should be moving their themselves towards the idea of family and and procreation that's it that's the only
(1:05:17) claim that Christians are trying to push forward and it's like it's so heavily resisted right it shows you just like
(1:05:24) the early feminist writers who said if women can stay at home and not work and
(1:05:29) not incur debt they'll do that yes we have to we we have to liberate them
(1:05:35) against their own will because their lives are way too comfortable right yeah
(1:05:40) uh and you've made this argument before that uh um that a society that gears
(1:05:46) toward that as the the duties for both men and women to concentrate on that it actually produces a society that then um
(1:05:54) sort of respects the woman and holds them in high regard ironically you know
(1:06:00) higher regard than the feminist they're held in the highest regard in fact the
(1:06:05) matrons are held in the highest regard right women can get I mean talk about
(1:06:10) getting away with uh with almost whatever you want if you're in a society where where female virtue is the thing
(1:06:18) which is uh pushed towards um and women like let's say you went
(1:06:23) back to the 40s or 50s where like 90% of women who were getting married you know
(1:06:29) don't quote that stat but it's something it's ridiculously high were chased intact virgins things like this right
(1:06:37) it's it it it seems that the amount of respect inside of society which was given to them was immense men were
(1:06:43) literally putting their jacket down so they didn't have to put their feet in a puddle i mean uh they were you know they
(1:06:50) basically their lives were handed to them on a bit of a silver platter and um
(1:06:56) I don't even have an issue with that but I have an issue with it if the idea of the achieved virtue isn't there um and
(1:07:04) then you put the the same duties on me that you yourself now no longer have [ __ ] that that's ridiculous yeah so you
(1:07:12) actually achieve a higher status in societies where women are uh viewed as
(1:07:19) um as having the highest function of reproduction they're like they're extremely valued and the matrons are
(1:07:24) well taken care of too right and they're not forced into the work you know forced into the workforce and take on all the
(1:07:31) debt and now they're like well I'm going to work really hard and then get out of this work system and and live this cushy
(1:07:37) life and you're like that's what we were offering you to begin with you know what I mean well and and it's like it's like
(1:07:42) really you think that women had less respect i mean when they walked into rooms the men stood up mhm you know uh
(1:07:50) they tipped their hats to them they took their hats off indoors a sign of respect to them so they didn't look like a shady
(1:07:56) character yeah like the the the world the world was entailed around men saying
(1:08:01) okay women deserve to be uh elevated matrons in society and they deserve to
(1:08:07) be uh well respected well taken care of and men were punished if they didn't take care of their families they were
(1:08:12) arrested and jailed yeah even illegal it was a crime crime even beyond the jailed
(1:08:18) like even the social shame uh of it we know social shame works right they just
(1:08:23) they the leftists and the progressive view has sort sort of taken it though they've monopolized the social shame and
(1:08:29) the soft uh sewing circle Christians stopped shaming people and that was a that was a big misstep uh in the west I
(1:08:36) think uh giving the shame um tool over to the baseless degenerate people like
(1:08:44) and then being like well we don't use that tactic it's like well that's a mistake big mistake well well it's
(1:08:51) mostly it's mostly just because um they they want to be viewed as authorities
(1:08:56) and they can't be viewed as an authority if you say things like "Well you're not really supposed to be teaching and
(1:09:02) you're really supposed to be shutting up and you're really supposed to be keeping your uh your faith works at church right
(1:09:09) you're not really supposed to be uh doing any of this stuff that you're doing but then they wouldn't have a a
(1:09:15) position of authority." So what they do is they say "Well I've bought a new reputation with Christianity and I'm in
(1:09:20) now in a position of teaching authority." Yeah over men and it's like uh no you're not no you're not [ __ ] off
(1:09:26) screw you uh that's not gonna happen and so of course they become I rate because what are you doing you're taking away
(1:09:33) you're taking away their authority right they don't have any authority so yeah justin Henley says Muhammad was poisoned
(1:09:39) by a woman shame that's funny just uh Jordan Flores $50 thank you so much that's very generous hey Andrew uh were
(1:09:46) you intimidated by how many times the soy said he cried per week andrew's just
(1:09:51) laughing through that whole segment did it feel like he oneuped you to your department yeah so was Piers piers was
(1:09:58) uh giggling piers was laughing his ass off too when I put my hand up and like made the crybaby you know thing pierce
(1:10:05) couldn't help it he just burst out laughing like I cried last week yeah
(1:10:10) well you can't help it right when when these guys when they tell you things which are so clearly
(1:10:16) antithetical to um to your own innate being you know what I mean obviously men
(1:10:23) crying often is not a thing which they should be doing right because it just it shows that you're enslaved to your
(1:10:29) passions you're a slave to your own passion no discipline yeah now there could be there could be cases where
(1:10:36) there are men who deal with so much trauma like I would guess that priests probably cry a lot you know what I mean
(1:10:42) but they have to hear the confessions of like the most evil [ __ ] on planet earth from human beings that then they need to
(1:10:49) guide towards the that's like Yeah i you know I could see them crying more than the average man you know what I mean but
(1:10:57) you really shouldn't it's really not a good precedent to be telling men that they should cry or fall to pieces or
(1:11:03) things like that and it also presents a vulnerability which can be exploited and I've often thought that the primary
(1:11:09) reason that women um at at higher institutional levels make these talking
(1:11:15) points the demand that women men become more emotional they cry more and they open up more is because their weapon of
(1:11:21) choice is slander and they can't slander you if they don't know anything right that makes sense you know what I mean so
(1:11:27) in a way you're opening yourself up by talking to them right to uh their
(1:11:33) primary weapon which is dirt on you or information yeah that's that's interesting that they s sort of take
(1:11:39) over and and weaponize what is ultimately what's confession and I've seen this happen even in the the
(1:11:45) standard uh sphere of influence in social media is that people are now doing their confession so to speak to
(1:11:52) the public and the public is their sort of like faux uh congregation or or you
(1:11:58) know there's no authority there there's nothing it's not religious it's not Christian but they still do it and
(1:12:04) definitely has been exploited that's why there's like these apology tours there's like there's the repentance tour you
(1:12:10) know it's similar where you they do the the secular repentist where they say
(1:12:16) sorry you know Dean Withers oh I said the bad thing and I I hope I can re uh you know redeem myself in the eyes of
(1:12:23) the of the masses and they're just doing a faux uh church right they're just doing a faux Yeah yeah the whole thing
(1:12:30) the whole thing is uh essentially it's uh public basically the whole public
(1:12:37) shaming tour mhm is uh designed as a rigorous gauntlet for cleansing the soul
(1:12:45) right right it is a pseudo religious art right this this will cleanse you right
(1:12:52) after we have sufficiently demeaned you for what you did now you can be put back in after your repentance into the the
(1:12:59) leadership role that you so desperately want right and that's what it is and
(1:13:04) they they'll do it i mean they do it time and time and time again and um you know you got to kind of hand it to
(1:13:10) Destiny a little bit because he doesn't do that he's like "Nah [ __ ] you." Yeah so I mean you get a little there's a
(1:13:16) little bit of respect that I have to kind of tip my hat on there yeah um but
(1:13:22) but you're right i mean it is I but I've always thought that a lot of the um the
(1:13:28) ideas which come from the top down NGO non-government organization the uh
(1:13:35) various feminist institutions which exist that kind of give marching orders
(1:13:40) to psychologist and psychological institutions is this idea of men opening
(1:13:46) up and being vulnerable and things like that yeah actually puts them at the mercy of slander and puts them at the
(1:13:52) mercy of revenge because women can't just get mad at you and then beat you up right so their their weapon of choice
(1:14:00) for assaulting you is to uh do reputational damage slander things like
(1:14:07) this like you can watch the sewing circle Christians do this every single time I do an event anywhere you'll see
(1:14:13) dozens of the sewing circle Christians uh attempting just that right how much
(1:14:19) how much slander and how much uh you know can we can we try to uh hit this
(1:14:24) guy with right because it's their only form of attack yeah can you imagine how much worse it would be if if uh the
(1:14:31) females were the priest uh hearing the confessions how much worse that would be
(1:14:37) it would be like a go it would be like TMZ it would be like a gossip channel but but in a way but in a way they are
(1:14:42) right I mean this is what's happening with with psych with psychologists right they're hearing the confession right and
(1:14:49) then they're giving you they're giving you various techniques in which to cope with this and cope with that but women
(1:14:56) have become so enamored with um with psychology I mean so enamored with
(1:15:03) psychology that at this point they all think they are psychologists um I mean they all just seem to think
(1:15:10) that they're psychologists you know they'll they'll uh literally sit there and try to psychoanalyze you but yeah
(1:15:16) I've often thought that that one of the main reasons is because it's a very powerful technique
(1:15:22) um for control for for women to be able to kind of verbally slam you with
(1:15:28) information that you open up to them so in a way you're kind of you're you're kind of [ __ ] yourself over by doing
(1:15:33) it right yeah yeah definitely stepping in your own [ __ ] i wouldn't you say that the that that the the females who are
(1:15:41) abandoning their duty to procreate also take those uh positions um to sort of uh
(1:15:48) still use their nature of nurturing and being motherly but they're just misplacing the the use of their the
(1:15:54) value in that sense they're just like perverting their motherly duties and just assigning it to these like broken
(1:16:01) man babies and and even though they're using it for manipulation there's still some Wouldn't Isn't it true that there's
(1:16:08) still something that they're following that's actually good in them they're just directing it at the wrong place
(1:16:17) yeah I'm not sure i mean it could be um maybe not yeah maybe not maybe not maybe
(1:16:23) not i've seen the clips yeah maybe not um Bobby C says "For $5 the queen's
(1:16:29) freedom of movement in the chess is because she's a hoe in the streets." That's that could be the case jeff
(1:16:35) Burroughs says "$5." Thank you so much please ask Andrew and answer yourself if you could push a button and magically
(1:16:42) one aspect of society today would change instantly what would you pick to change
(1:16:47) it with the hit of a button think about that oh man so I can only change one thing so
(1:16:57) the point of the question is to try to to reduce down to what I think is maybe the most valuable even though I don't
(1:17:03) think that way i think that there's like a multitude of things which are are really valuable to push the button for
(1:17:09) so I guess with immediate concerns if I could push a button I would push a
(1:17:14) button which eliminated all non-familybased propaganda from the government
(1:17:20) that's what I would do that's good so I think that that would
(1:17:27) correct you know not all the social issues but it would correct a great deal of social issues just not having any any
(1:17:35) anti-natalist or any alternative family uh propaganda from the government level
(1:17:40) down I think would be just like a [ __ ] massive start head start in uh
(1:17:47) in this kind of bleak future we look at yeah I would I'm mine's similar it would
(1:17:52) be more expansive to like uh if I could hit the button I would it would
(1:17:58) eliminate everything me myself I deemed indecent in in public including
(1:18:04) propaganda from whether it's the government or or companies like on billboards and [ __ ] i would just I would
(1:18:10) just uh I would do it essentially a a Jim Bob authoritative blur out of all
(1:18:15) the things that I find discussed trying to one up me boy you trying to one up me here well I mean I just want to go for
(1:18:22) the I really want to just go for the most power right but no I actually have a question about your answer um why is
(1:18:28) it you said government and not like a company wouldn't you want to push back on let's say a company billboard
(1:18:35) propaganda would you shut that I would shut that down if it was like so egregious and nefarious i would I would
(1:18:42) take it down well I think I think that that's um I think that that's kind of
(1:18:48) entailed in government propaganda so the thing is is like if the government itself is is propagating these ideas
(1:18:54) then they have NOS's behind it which are assisting uh with with the government
(1:18:59) doing this those NOS's give marching orders to companies anyway right the revolving door you know those
(1:19:05) partnerships yeah that makes sense um Tubblet $5 says "Women already want to
(1:19:10) be resubjugated they don't want to work and want to be taken care of the downside is they also want to [ __ ]
(1:19:17) around yeah i just find that so bizarre to nubble is that Christianity is offering them a vision of what they
(1:19:24) already want and they're saying "No I don't want that but I still want that." You're like they're just confused that's
(1:19:30) what the That's what the sexual revolution was about you touched on it earlier but the sexual revolution was
(1:19:36) about keeping privilege for women intact while uh
(1:19:42) simultaneously taking away any sort of criticism for actions so any accountability for actions so the idea
(1:19:49) is just like it shouldn't matter who I sleep with it shouldn't matter um uh you
(1:19:55) know how many partners I've had it shouldn't matter that I don't have sex when I'm waiting for marriage i should
(1:20:00) not be criticized for these things uh but I should still be treated as the vulnerable sex and I should still be uh
(1:20:08) given you know uh or treated with decency and treated you know x way like
(1:20:14) all other women are treated blah blah blah blah blah blah and so it was just a way of um it was like there a women's
(1:20:22) version of the gay rights movement right you know what I mean yeah yeah I shouldn't be criticized for uh for doing
(1:20:28) this alternative lifestyle unnatural horrible [ __ ] thing that's damaging to society because you know I can't help
(1:20:36) it it's just the way I am okay well that the way you are sucks so
(1:20:42) you know it was so effective though like h how was it so effective do you think
(1:20:47) there was I obviously this isn't a one answer question it wasn't it wasn't that
(1:20:53) effective at first i mean it took a it took a long time for for it to really
(1:20:59) um you know take hold of uh of the human psyche i mean even when I was a kid the
(1:21:05) the skanks in school and [ __ ] like that were pretty frowned on they were pretty frowned upon and we
(1:21:12) were you know they were they were getting made fun of and [ __ ] like that and it was not they didn't have an easy time of it yeah um but you know in in
(1:21:20) modernity now I was uh I was watching a video by Pearl so I don't know if these stats are accurate but they are
(1:21:26) terrifying right she was saying basically all of the zoomers who are in the reproductive age bracket um about
(1:21:33) 10% of them are on Only Fans yeah I saw that stat too and it's hard to tell like
(1:21:38) there are people on Only Fans who don't do pornography and they just use it how they do well very very few don't though
(1:21:46) so it's like you know if if it's if it's like one in 25,000 who doesn't i don't
(1:21:53) think it's going to adjust that stat too much and I don't think that the women in that age bracket are going on there to
(1:21:59) do a cooking show yeah that's right yeah uh contraception meme TV yeah I would
(1:22:04) add that i was going to say just general technology um you said well it didn't work it It took a a while for this to
(1:22:10) sort of set in and I was trying to think of all the variables i think contraception the ability to just have
(1:22:16) sex and this goes for men and women as far as in contrast to their duties is if a man could have sex and not have to
(1:22:22) deal with being a father if a woman could have sex and not have to deal with being pregnant and being a mother it's like this like unspoken degenerate
(1:22:30) agreement that that's just been become the norm that people are just sort of like born into they inherit our children
(1:22:37) unfortunately are in basically born into a system where that is kind of the norm where it's like well I just going to
(1:22:44) avoid all this other stuff well if if the technology allows you to have
(1:22:49) endless sex and uh there's no social shame there's in fact it's celebrated uh
(1:22:54) so you have multiple things happening at once I think the shame tactic is might
(1:23:00) be a better propaganda the propaganda is the big one I think yeah that's why I think I Yeah while I agree that the
(1:23:07) contraception uh enables the activity right i think that it's the propaganda
(1:23:14) in media especially um and from the government down which is the um you know
(1:23:21) the alter basically it's the pushing of the alternative family is the that was the major thing which enabled the the
(1:23:29) promiscuous behavior is is that like look alternative families are just as viable and good as the uh
(1:23:36) crossgenerational family you know what I mean yeah the nuclear family itself isn't the best dynamic you know nuclear
(1:23:43) family is um you could say it's a building block of society but it's really not it's a crossgenerational
(1:23:49) family it's the idea of cousins and uncles and aunts and you know uh fathers
(1:23:56) and sons who all are in kind of a a regional demographic area as a support
(1:24:02) network for each other you know what I mean that's why the Mormons are so powerful yeah that's what Well it's why
(1:24:08) Asians are too asians yeah it's why Asians It's why Asians are you know um
(1:24:14) they try to put them in the category of basically white privilege now because Asians will come here and they'll rent a
(1:24:20) room you know that's uh that's no bigger than probably your son's bedroom and six of them will sleep in it they'll all get
(1:24:26) jobs they'll pull all of their money together they'll buy a restaurant they'll stay in that room and then they'll one by one start buying houses
(1:24:33) for each person there pulling their money yeah and suddenly they have crossgenerational wealth and then they
(1:24:39) take advantage of every social and educational system which is available like um they they do these things the
(1:24:45) right way and so you know the the the idea there is um is that the the
(1:24:53) building block for them for life is is the family and the extended family and
(1:24:58) they go to great lengths to to uh to keep their families intact and what do
(1:25:03) you have you have patriarchs in those families yeah and that generational thing as you pointed out a lot of people
(1:25:10) uh who even my own listeners and yours like this idea that what you're saying is it doesn't go without some sacrifice
(1:25:16) like you said like you can't just do the crossgenerational thing sometimes especially today without doing something
(1:25:23) similar to what you just described where you have to sacrifice maybe the size of your house and uh you have to manage
(1:25:30) things in a different way if you want to produce that kind of effect it's not just some amenity that you can choose to
(1:25:36) have like add it to your Amazon cart it's actually quite that's why you say like when someone challenges you and say
(1:25:42) oh you have this idea of like uh you know um the symphonyia and and this kind
(1:25:47) of like beautiful view of an orthodox society and you admittedly say well this this is like how many generations am I
(1:25:54) talking about i'm not deluded to think that this is something that's a push button um result you know some
(1:26:01) customized thing you can order um this takes a lot of Yeah you touched on discipline yeah you're right you're
(1:26:07) right you touch on the biggest the biggest factor here right which is that happiness has become a drug mhm and the
(1:26:13) left and progressives are the biggest drug pusher right be do what makes you happy you this is the most probably the
(1:26:21) most common trope in the west are the words do what makes you happy or you'll hear does this make you happy are you
(1:26:28) happy is this you know what I mean as long as you're happy right it's a it's a huge drug which is pushed on people and
(1:26:35) it's like you know it used to be the case at least historically people are like well one day when I'm dead I'll be
(1:26:41) happy right because because the conditionals of life were pretty were pretty harsh right um the thing is
(1:26:50) though is I mean there were still plenty of happy people don't get me wrong i'm just I'm just pointing out that it wasn't it wasn't assigned as a drug like
(1:26:56) it is now you know what I mean do you have your happiness pills are you happy enough oh if you're not happy then
(1:27:02) there's a problem right right and it's like no if you're not if you're not happy right that doesn't mean that
(1:27:07) there's a problem no you know what I mean like there's there's plenty of times that you have to do tasks that
(1:27:12) don't make you happy which are actually fixing problems right you know like I had a windstorm that came through and
(1:27:18) knocked down a tree and I have to go out there soon with a chainsaw and cut this thing up that does not make me happy
(1:27:24) yeah yeah and you still have to do it even if it didn't Yeah even if it didn't Yeah
(1:27:29) that's why the the that's why the duty thing is so brutal isn't it like to all these views i it's just to me it's the
(1:27:36) best possible angle of attack in in these debates is like you go to if you
(1:27:42) go to duties you realize that you can give one example of doing something that you ought to do that's the best thing to
(1:27:48) do even from their system is the most moral thing to do even though they don't even have a a moral foundation and yet
(1:27:54) it's completely anti antithetical to their immediate happiness like they they
(1:27:59) can't possibly defend the happiness uh notion and they do it all the time they oh look at Finland's the happiest they
(1:28:05) do all these like you know studies or whatever and we're going yeah that's not even a metric that we care about like
(1:28:12) that's not ultimately what's going to keep a society going is whether or not everybody's quote happy it doesn't make
(1:28:18) any sense yeah well you could why don't we just issue [ __ ] people lithium yeah that's what I'm saying that would
(1:28:24) make them happy like that would make them happy but that's what I mean is like um the but the the idea of this is
(1:28:30) a drug it's a drug you know what I mean we need to constantly be happy we need to be engaged in happy things i want to
(1:28:37) be happy happy and it's like look the human state and condition requires a lot
(1:28:43) of [ __ ] suffering yeah it does more suffering than than happiness and in
(1:28:48) fact in order to achieve some things which make you happy like if you want to have a beach body or some [ __ ] like that
(1:28:54) that's a lot of suffering man you know that's a lot of suffering so what do they do they they find shortcuts for
(1:29:00) this like take OMIC take this weight loss pill take this take that uh these
(1:29:06) will give you shortcuts so that you can continue with the happiness protocol yep
(1:29:11) right um and still get this try to achieve this result that you want and
(1:29:16) it's like no you know uh the truth is is that you don't end up achieving the result that you want and you can't
(1:29:22) really cut corners too much in the suffering aspect when it comes to achieving goals if you want to actually
(1:29:29) achieve them yeah the irony there is that even shortcutting um the goals
(1:29:34) doesn't even give you what you call happiness anyway even if we granted okay fine go be happy the notice how when you
(1:29:42) shortcut or or or do anything shortcuted and you don't earn the thing like like
(1:29:47) whenever we do this you know some people love doing this but like that's not that's not at least fulfilling when
(1:29:53) you're when you know you you skip you you you jump the brook of the hard work it just doesn't pay off anyway um yeah
(1:30:00) well you can even think that think of this i'd explain this to video game like adamant video game players the same way
(1:30:07) like look um when you're playing a game with
(1:30:12) somebody else and they want to play it on easy mode what is it that you say like you get upset right mhm it takes
(1:30:19) all the challenge out of the game and so then any sense of accomplishment you have when you beat it you know that you
(1:30:25) didn't beat the real game yeah right you beat something else you beat a dumbed down watered down version of this thing
(1:30:32) and so it's you can't be proud of mediocrity right if you beat it on
(1:30:37) extreme mode it's like then you get that dopamine hit of like man I did something here do you think that's how uh same-sex
(1:30:44) uh couples I'll quote put in quotes couples feel when they have when they buy a kid
(1:30:52) well I think I think that the most most of the conditional of that is just the
(1:30:57) be happy right but they fall into a trap that a lot of women fall into which is
(1:31:03) the the idea of like um and this used to be more common than it is now but if we
(1:31:09) just have a baby you know then I'll be happy right and it's like uh that doesn't work no that's actually
(1:31:16) your brain your brain is tricking you because it wants you to have a baby that's true when it's telling you you're
(1:31:21) going to be happy but it's actually probably going to increase your suffering drastically mhm you know but
(1:31:26) it through that suffering most women seem to be very placated like they'll go through the suffering and this and that
(1:31:32) and then it does actually make them happy when they have a child there right they're like "Wow this is great." But
(1:31:37) that required a lot of suffering didn't it yeah yeah and everyone who's a parent knows
(1:31:43) yeah but it doesn't fix the problems though which were making you unhappy is what I'm saying you know it doesn't fix
(1:31:48) any of the external problems just like with the with homosexuals them going "Well we're pretty miserable that we
(1:31:55) can't have kids right?" Um them going and adopting kids does not ultimately
(1:32:01) end up um getting rid of the external problem which is the fact that they have gay sex that's not going away so that
(1:32:08) part of the misery just stays intact right yeah yeah it doesn't doesn't fulfill it uh FB asked a good question
(1:32:14) $499 thank you so much when was the last time propaganda was used for good
(1:32:20) i'm trying to think propaganda has has a negative connotation to it anyway yeah it does prop propaganda the
(1:32:27) definitionally is a negative thing the reason I use the word is because um
(1:32:33) people understand immediately what it means right they just understand immediately when you're talking about
(1:32:40) promotion of of values and certain things in order to adjust society the
(1:32:46) way that you want to now propaganda traditionally has been used for patriotism you know that's where
(1:32:52) superheroes came from that's where um you know where the idea of honor in the
(1:32:58) military came from you know what I mean when you think about honor in the military it's actually kind of stupid
(1:33:03) right so the idea here is like you're going to go stab 18-year-old kids in the face and and there's some kind of honor
(1:33:10) in that but but the truth is is like in order to
(1:33:16) have this protector class you're going to have to give them a sufficient amount of honor that comes with the fact that
(1:33:23) they have this kind of really brutal dirty job to do uh that is necessary
(1:33:29) right it's kind of kind of repugnant but totally necessary so So the trade-off
(1:33:34) there's like there's a lot of honor in the uniform right there's a lot of honor there's a lot of prestige there's a lot
(1:33:41) of things which come with that to offset kind of the ugliness of the things that you have to do when you're in it right
(1:33:47) so um you know ultimately I think that propaganda for patriotism is really good
(1:33:53) but you can also have patriotism propaganda be geared towards the family unit as well the same way that you had
(1:34:00) Rosie the Riveter as a propaganda for women to put screws in packs so that we
(1:34:06) could fight a war right you can easily have propaganda the other way that just
(1:34:11) shows women in kind of family functioning units and things like this um you know kind of enjoying life and uh
(1:34:19) and you can have the kind of pro propaganda say things like honor women in society especially those with
(1:34:26) families you know you can do things like that and man it would really assist with turning the tide so when's the last time
(1:34:32) it was used for good purposes maybe the may maybe Vietnam War but not really
(1:34:39) even then yeah like at a mass level obviously we see clips like there are
(1:34:44) more and more clips of like pro- women pro- family pro mother pro- father things but um on a mass scale yeah I
(1:34:52) don't I can't even tell you um I can't even give you a single example of really needs to be it really needs to be top
(1:34:58) down like it it really it doesn't work that well bottom up that's why people
(1:35:04) who start counter countercultural revolutions from the bottom up the very first thing they do is try to seize
(1:35:10) power or get into powerful positions because they understand how much better it worked from the top down mhm when you
(1:35:16) seize the institutions um it gives you a huge amount of leeway
(1:35:21) and power and authority to enforce these these types of views yeah I was going to
(1:35:28) say uh maybe I was just about to say oh maybe we should uh you know uh do a
(1:35:33) campaign for massive proliferation of like AI family- based AI but then you're
(1:35:39) just going to end up with weird pictures of like mothers without thumbs and [ __ ] like weird weird faces and stuff it's
(1:35:45) going to be counterintuitive because the the ability Well I mean I there's you know there's
(1:35:53) um like a really easy thing to point to there used to be a billboard on a road I
(1:35:59) would drive down that had a a shotgun on it that I didn't particularly care for right but it was it was like a an
(1:36:06) advertisement for this type of shotgun and it was a it was a Mossberg variant so I didn't care about it you
(1:36:12) know what I mean mhm but I saw this billboard so many times right i was in a gun shop and saw one i was like "Ah well
(1:36:19) I'll just pick one up." Right and I knew right then and there that I was only picking one up because I had seen this
(1:36:25) thing like 8,000 times on this billboard driving by it mhm right so I mean it
(1:36:30) worked it worked on me right even Even though I consciously knew that that was the case it still worked on me mhm and
(1:36:39) it's like why wouldn't that work if the billboard uh showed something to aspire to i think Yeah I think that would be I
(1:36:45) think that's great a great idea however that could happen i think um I think we're in the position where it could
(1:36:51) happen uh the top down way like you said uh mass mass concentrated effort of of
(1:36:58) propaganda for family directed toward mothers too i mean men need it too a
(1:37:03) little bit especially these flailing men that are feminist essentially um who
(1:37:08) think who take this Homer Simpson uh you know Al Bundy approach we talked
(1:37:14) about a couple years ago Andrew that that's been a propaganda machine against men is like man is the dumb guy he's the
(1:37:21) he can't do [ __ ] around the house he he's he's stupid he's he's he's lazy
(1:37:26) he's clumsy you hear you hear feminists you hear feminists complain about this to this day and I've never seen the
(1:37:32) evidence of this right but I hear them all the time talk about how um Oh you
(1:37:38) know having my husband around it's like having another kid it's like I don't ever see that in reality what I see in
(1:37:45) reality is the opposite it's like it's almost like the husband has another kid he's like "Oh my god another
(1:37:52) emotional breakdown oh my god another [ __ ] hormonal rage [ __ ] you know thing going on oh my god I have to
(1:37:58) comfort you you're crying again about some nonsense." You know what I mean oh you know like uh I never uh or um you
(1:38:06) know I got 15 things uh accomplished on this honeydew list that you had but uh the last two things you're going to
(1:38:13) [ __ ] about those for the next two weeks you're like a petulant spoiled child like I my experience has been exactly
(1:38:19) the opposite inside of most families it's never that the man is some bumbling idiot uh and is um you know it's like
(1:38:27) the woman has another kid because she has to do the [ __ ] laundry it's the opposite right is I see the man having
(1:38:32) to overly compensate all often um for women's lack of emotional regulation
(1:38:40) and it's like um you know I often tell tell women uh this and this is something
(1:38:47) which they all seem to be able to relate to when I ask about like irrational fears have have you ever woke up from a
(1:38:54) dead sleep right had a dream that your guy was cheating on you or doing something he wasn't supposed to be doing
(1:39:00) and and woke him up because you wanted to talk to him about it
(1:39:06) this is such a common thing for couples that's not talked about where a woman
(1:39:11) will have an irrational fear wake their husband up from a dead sleep in order to complain about this irrational fear
(1:39:17) right well how's that not the equivalent of a [ __ ] kid coming into your room a
(1:39:22) 5-year-old and going "Dad I had a bad dream." And a monster i had a bad dream you know what I mean the monster's under
(1:39:29) my bed blah blah blah blah blah blah now you can imagine if a man woke a woman up and dead shake dead shaked her awake and
(1:39:35) was like "Hey I just had this bad dream." It would be she'd be like "What the she go to sleep you [ __ ] retard."
(1:39:41) Right that's funny you're like "Yeah that would be a terri" and and and we make an exception
(1:39:48) for the woman right we don't go we don't say we don't say act like a man we don't say "What are you doing honey act like a
(1:39:54) man right?" No no no we make the exception it's like But I can point to so many instances like this of infantile
(1:40:01) behavior from women completely infantile behavior you know and uh and and this is
(1:40:09) just supposed to be accepted you know what I mean but somehow they're they're ra they're you know assisting in raising
(1:40:15) their manb babies you know what I mean this this is their narrative and they say the most ridiculous [ __ ] you know
(1:40:21) what I mean they're like "Men don't even know how to load a dishwasher." I'm like "Yeah they know how to load dishwashers what are you talking about?" And you
(1:40:28) know what you know what else they load them correctly you know like there's an actual correct way to load them and they
(1:40:35) actually do it the right way you know I've heard them say ridiculous things men don't know how to use a washer and
(1:40:40) dryer men don't know how to iron their clothes it's like I've in fact I've met more men who know how to iron their
(1:40:46) clothes than I have met women who know how to iron clothes i prefer ironing my
(1:40:51) clothes um I I could care less how the dishwasher is loaded so I'm probably
(1:40:56) guilty of quote loading it improperly cuz I just am like [ __ ] put it in there it's going to wash somehow
(1:41:04) wash it i actually end up washing my dishes like directly then that's probably then that's probably still a
(1:41:10) writer way but I'm just pointing out like that you know these they they act
(1:41:15) like women act like infants and children constantly and then at the same time
(1:41:20) feminists pretend that uh oh you know men are really just being being very
(1:41:26) infantile i mean they they won't come home and do all the housework chores as well as the entire burden that they have
(1:41:31) on them for everything else that's ridiculous it's like that's the most infantile way to view
(1:41:38) uh and selfish by the way to to view a family dynamic anyway and it's like um
(1:41:43) you know we have to suage um irrational fears in women constantly like non-stop
(1:41:49) all the time um this is a very common thing which happens inside of couples
(1:41:55) relationships where women will develop irrational fears or already have irrational fears and they want them to
(1:42:02) be addressed and placated constantly and so like uh yeah go ahead my tech for
(1:42:09) $5 asks what happened with the boxing match between not so erodite's husband and Andrew is the training is there
(1:42:15) training for a fight i'm sure I'm sure that's going to not with him but I mean eventually I mean maybe he'll fight
(1:42:21) somebody yeah we'll do we'll do a greater fight you know what I mean but you know maybe maybe I'll do something
(1:42:27) with somebody who has more clout i don't need to lower myself no no yeah
(1:42:33) yeah there's got to be someone in there yeah how about how about somebody who has some sufficient enough clout to to
(1:42:40) do one but anyway um Jordan says "For 50 bucks thank you so much for that." Uh
(1:42:47) Tommy Lauren disagrees in quotes that's really funny um yeah Tommy Lauren she's
(1:42:53) going to tell you exactly what a real man is but you point out what a real woman should do and you're a [ __ ]
(1:42:58) misogynist right right the way this is the way it works all the time you're not a real man what a real man does is
(1:43:04) capitulate to my [ __ ] needs and you're like "Nah I think what a real woman is is a woman of great virtue
(1:43:09) who's attempting to achieve feminine feminine virtues which uh which then men
(1:43:14) and women will both respect." I You just want to tell women what to do with their bodies like okay well you're not doing
(1:43:21) that though by telling me that what a real man is is somebody who protects you and and provides for you yeah i'm not
(1:43:27) telling them very common with the that right that covert feminist view is that
(1:43:33) they make fun of the women um the the progressives who say you just want to
(1:43:39) you know they'll tell Tommy Lauren or whatever her name is that that she just wants to control women's bodies and
(1:43:44) she's like that's absurd but what you're saying is that even she has a version of that it's just not about abortion it's
(1:43:50) about something else it's like another step away from controlling yeah it's controlling men's bodies like the the
(1:43:57) whole idea of a draft is controlling men's bodies you know and and it's
(1:44:02) pretty upfront about it you know the fact the fact of the matter is is that
(1:44:08) if you join the military you become a GI governmentissued you become uh
(1:44:13) temporarily owned by the United States government if you hurt yourself on purpose you get brought up on charges
(1:44:20) for destruction of government property not a joke you know it's like I I can't
(1:44:27) think of a thing where your body is owned more than that yeah and it's it's
(1:44:32) like Yeah that's like death resulting in death yeah you're told what you can eat
(1:44:38) you're told where you can stand you're told where you're going to go today you're told exactly what you need to do
(1:44:45) at all times you're completely controlled and it's like but that's your dude
(1:44:50) that's your duty though no yeah your duty to do it right yeah bobby C5 says "One thing I never understood is why the
(1:44:56) man sleeps on the couch when the wife is mad or he's in the doghouse." Quote yeah that seems to be a meme that just sort
(1:45:03) of developed as well where you're in trouble um well usually you know it's
(1:45:09) because you did something you know quote wrong or something like that but um it is interesting that that developed where
(1:45:16) the man the man is in the doghouse but we we would never do that like if the if
(1:45:22) the wife did something equally wrong right we're not talking about like you know cheating or something crazy just
(1:45:28) like something you know said something wrong imagine we just kick you know kick on the couch the the development the
(1:45:34) development of that actually was a dunk on women not on men the idea is like I'd
(1:45:39) rather sleep in the [ __ ] dog house than dating that's interesting oh that makes sense that actually makes more
(1:45:45) sense i'd rather I'd rather be in the [ __ ] doghouse sharing it with the dog than be in the house with this woman
(1:45:50) right now i'd rather I'd rather be sleeping on the couch than be in a room
(1:45:55) with you right now you know what I mean it was it was initially um it was to to dunk on women you know
(1:46:03) what I mean and um and but but what it became is like uh the weaponization of
(1:46:09) the meme went went the opposite direction they're like you know you can just go sleep on the couch interesting
(1:46:14) you know you can just go sleep on the couch mhm um President Sundowner a
(1:46:20) member for 24 months that's awesome thanks for your support a real leader only gives directions i already agree
(1:46:25) with Becky yeah that's funny exactly um Altervoid $5 need to make the
(1:46:31) wife sleep in the kitchen that's funny yeah that would be the equivalent you're going to You sleep in the kitchen
(1:46:37) um is there anyone uh who while we have him wanted to counter uh feminism or
(1:46:45) counter our uh rejection of a feminism being that we do have a discord now um
(1:46:51) you're welcome opposition is welcome if if you'd like if not I'll just keep responding to super chats and cover
(1:46:57) anything else going on uh here yeah [ __ ] these people keep responding to super chats bro yeah yeah yeah you don't Yeah
(1:47:05) [ __ ] these people you know there's always someone a hater or something here i don't get as many as you but um I'm
(1:47:10) always I always have to reach out and be like "Hey is there any are there any haters
(1:47:17) um my husband tells me to get in the shed." That's really funny get in the shed put the wife in the litter box it's
(1:47:24) funny um so yeah and as far as the other guy
(1:47:30) he just looks like a regular commentator uh dude who's probably just not prepared
(1:47:35) he doesn't look like he debates so I'm not even gonna bother looking at him ken
(1:47:41) Harbo no idea whatever um any other questions for Andrew while
(1:47:50) he's here y'all don't like feminism why do you hate women Mr westward yeah why do you hate women
(1:47:56) uh I don't think what's her name takes that approach she's not that dramatic is she not so erodite she's a little more
(1:48:02) nuanced than that well she the thing is is um Aerodite's
(1:48:08) going to massively underestimate you okay massively underestimate you so uh
(1:48:14) these people never uh are well equipped because they're so [ __ ] arrogant they
(1:48:20) always think that they just always have the tenable position you're wrong right and inside of their various groups it's
(1:48:26) really funny i always say never underestimate leftists right and their groups are always like "Well conservatives are just dumb you don't
(1:48:32) even have to really contend with them you know what I mean and so these people just get [ __ ] mangled in these
(1:48:37) debates and they're like I don't know why you don't even really attempt to to
(1:48:43) know your opponent's positions and why they think the way they do and they spent hours and days and weeks and
(1:48:49) months and in my case years uh studying the opposition to make sure I understood not just what they believe but why they
(1:48:55) believe it yeah yeah they're Yeah that uh and especially the specific quote lowercase
(1:49:04) Christian position she's taking i'm sure I'm sure she's not even pushed on it enough absent her engagement with you
(1:49:10) and maybe some other people associated with your your position and your arguments it's like she probably doesn't
(1:49:16) have to defend it much um I would I would well they think they always think that um and this has traditionally been
(1:49:24) the case right i mean I guess you say traditionally in a very loose aspect because like the Red Pill Manosphere
(1:49:31) content creator sphere is a reasonably new thing right reasonably new you know
(1:49:37) it's not to say it's not like a decade plus old but that's still reasonably new and it has been the case that these guys
(1:49:43) are really good at at kind of stats and things like this but not not very good
(1:49:49) at debating their actual positions and debating on issues and things like that and when kind of uh the Christians
(1:49:57) entered into the sphere and started kicking the [ __ ] out of everybody um they they now have kind of um in some
(1:50:06) ways mouthpieces which are able to destroy feminist views mhm much better
(1:50:12) than they can you know what I mean and so you know in this in this way the
(1:50:18) leftist women have had kind of an easy time of it for a while going and you know wrecking the red pill content
(1:50:24) creators or whatever uh but then they run into this other aspect of what they would consider the manosphere which is
(1:50:30) people have grounded um epistemology and they just get [ __ ]
(1:50:36) wrecked and they don't know what to do about it and they don't have any defense against it and um it it it really has
(1:50:43) turned the tide aside i mean that whole sphere really needed guys like us in a
(1:50:49) big way they it really did yeah cuz they're even their right-wingers if they're arguing with other kind of
(1:50:56) liberals classical liberals these these these uh covert feminists and and the
(1:51:01) man the the men the benapiros and all of these people who hold really a classical
(1:51:06) liberal approach to most things they're very they're very hesitant to explore a
(1:51:11) little more rigorous uh authoritative positions and so they're not used they're used to arguing with other
(1:51:17) liberals they just happen to be sort of like conservative liberals and so they grant each other equality in
(1:51:23) egalitarianism generally speaking so what's the debate ultimately about it kind of makes sense that that these
(1:51:29) types on on the left the progressives the not so aerodite and and company they're mostly used to arguing against
(1:51:37) um the same position just on the right side it's like our liberalism is better than your liberalism and we're doing
(1:51:43) something different we're saying no we're not even going to grant you that so you know yeah we're just saying that
(1:51:49) it's an unmititigated disaster and that the society that we postulate is better
(1:51:54) even if it limits these things you consider to be valuable and you need to tell us why that's not the case and they
(1:52:00) can't right and so so I mean ultimately uh yeah I mean it need it also it
(1:52:06) suffered from a huge amount of degeneracy that whole space because of pickup artists and other people now
(1:52:13) there's plenty of people who are in kind of that red pill content creator space who aren't degenerates but there's an
(1:52:19) awful lot who are and so like it really did need the reinvigoration of people who understood the views and could
(1:52:26) reconcile them properly to try to get across what these guys were really trying to say yeah and um and so you
(1:52:33) know these these kind of female champions who have been trying to go around and smash everybody you know on
(1:52:41) on this are now just getting [ __ ] mangled left and right and they're reeling they don't exactly know how to
(1:52:47) deal with it yeah it makes sense um Bwick says $5 for Andrew does James from
(1:52:52) MDD hate the fact that unintentionally launched your career into orbit with the
(1:52:58) Dillah Hunty situation uh he's always is short with you no I think it's the opposite but you could answer that i
(1:53:04) think he's happy that he I Well well he wasn't at the time i
(1:53:10) don't think that I don't think that the Dillah Hunty debate launched my career into orbit um I was I think I think I
(1:53:18) was already on the incline and if that debate had never happened I I would I
(1:53:23) would still have ended up essentially where I'm at um but you know I don't know i don't
(1:53:31) know if James is uh is happy or not happy about it or what uh for a long
(1:53:36) time I was you know he he says I wasn't but I was basically blacklisted from MDD
(1:53:42) i mean that I don't know what else to call it when they were calling you for
(1:53:47) you know a debate or two a month and then they just stop all together right yeah i I think what happened he realized
(1:53:54) the value though uh ultimately actually I know this for a fact he he realized the value and he was like oh well that
(1:54:02) moment blew up for him it blew up the culture at MDD which was dominant uh
(1:54:09) progressives just dictating the whole thing they still have it largely in their chat uh but it's changing right
(1:54:16) now like if you take a basic poll during a debate it's dominated by Christians now whereas just a year ago it was
(1:54:22) completely leftleaning it was all these soft progressives yeah well I've I think
(1:54:28) that The Crucible has had um and it's not just me at all it's um it's also the
(1:54:35) entire crew and the various people that we work with like you Jake Rattlesnake many other very talented content
(1:54:42) creators and very talented debaters and very talented essayist um they they're
(1:54:48) able to package the ideas in a way where they're well understood right mhm and
(1:54:53) it's not a like some crazy white nationalist trope or some [ __ ] stupid
(1:54:58) [ __ ] like that right it they're they're actually packaged the correct way so that people can understand what the view
(1:55:04) is without all the noise and all the straw manning and it's had a massively positive influence on most of these
(1:55:10) platforms and it's brought a lot of Christians in and what's really funny is as much as Christians hate me for like
(1:55:17) uh EBT and those guys right they just loathe me um because you know I don't
(1:55:23) know you're not theologically sound enough or I don't like this argument or you're a hypocrite on this whatever
(1:55:29) whatever their [ __ ] complaints are um they can't deny the effectiveness of
(1:55:35) moving uh huge groups of Christians into these various spaces and [ __ ] and and
(1:55:42) mangling the progressives that are in there they like they just can't deny the effectiveness of that so the one hand
(1:55:48) they can [ __ ] and moan and whine and cry about me but on the other hand they have to make a concession that we have
(1:55:54) changed the online culture for the better yeah I agree with that um and honestly most of it most of it ends up
(1:56:00) being about money let's face it like people who make a lot of money yeah
(1:56:05) that's what it ends up being they don't see they don't see of course that you know I have a staff and that I pay out a
(1:56:11) shitload of money and I pay tons in taxes and like they don't see any of that right they just think that um oh
(1:56:18) you made you made uh or the the channel made $2,000 today and YouTube took 30% of that um so you know you're you're
(1:56:26) you're getting in your [ __ ] Bugatti and driving down the road they don't realize that it's run like any other business where there's tons of expenses
(1:56:32) or staff pay there's all sorts of other things that go into it right they just think well well um you you make money
(1:56:40) online and I don't therefore you're bad yeah i mean they're also full of [ __ ] you just tell them just ask them
(1:56:45) straight up if suddenly whatever you were doing online on your channel cuz they all all these people have channels
(1:56:51) too uh suddenly resulted in a massive amount of super chats and engagement and
(1:56:56) memberships and sharing and pe people making clips of you would you just like f you know you just take a virtuous
(1:57:02) approach and be like I can't do this this is not Yeah like Yeah right dude just it's it's just just say it upfront
(1:57:08) you just say [ __ ] I wish I was uh pulling in that much money just say it dude like any of you in the in the chat
(1:57:14) who that's your complaint generally speaking just you know just come clean um H Brassie says for a member for 10
(1:57:21) months thank you H Brassy for the both of you in my opinion the undercover or covert feminists on the right are far
(1:57:28) more nefarious and seemingly have an even lower level of contempt for men that disagree with them than leftist
(1:57:35) thoughts uh you can answer that Andrew uh can you repeat the question he's
(1:57:41) basically saying the covert feminists are more nefarious and they have more contempt for men than the the uh the
(1:57:47) leftist yeah that's another Well that's another thing that we've done which was
(1:57:52) desperately needed um is we have gone into the TPUs and the Daily Wires and
(1:58:00) the Fox Fox News hosts of the world and just completely bludgeoned them on the
(1:58:06) fact that they're almost as bad as the feminists that they rage against and here's why like we just don't let you're
(1:58:11) not going to let any of them escape you know what I mean and the uh idea of of
(1:58:18) uh Christianity needing masculinity to be a thing which it also values not just
(1:58:26) feminine qualities cuz women really want us to be feminine Christians for some reason um I think that that it has
(1:58:34) brought huge value whether you agree with me or disagree with me it has brought big value to these different
(1:58:41) platforms to finally be able to see that hey there are there are actually men out here who can represent that view well
(1:58:48) and um even if I don't like the guy personally he represents the view well and that's the best that we can do also
(1:58:54) it's rattled it's basically fractured the pretty wellestablished for many years uh dialectic this leftright Ben
(1:59:02) Shapiro approach where everything's like left and the right the left and the right and we're going "Well no you guys have problems." Like and Jay's been on
(1:59:08) this for a while uh criti criticizing this sort of like soft um conservative
(1:59:15) TM uh that's been in place that just keeps you in this leftright ping-pong game and when we start to infuse new
(1:59:23) arguments that go against both of those sides those very like controlled sterile
(1:59:28) sides uh it causes a lot of disrupt uh disruption so if anything the disruption
(1:59:34) even your uh opposition people who don't like you or people don't like your approach or tone police you or don't
(1:59:39) like you're making money they couldn't possibly honestly disagree with uh that
(1:59:45) it's a good thing that we that the kind of disruption that's followed in these um political uh theological Well in fact
(1:59:53) many of them will just make that concession many of them make the concession yeah he does a great job with this but I hate him anyway because of A
(1:59:59) B C and D it's like there's just nothing you can do for those Yeah to to do anything about those
(2:00:06) people i mean um that it's just you know some people are just just that way they
(2:00:11) just are going to hate you no matter what you do and I just don't care i you know at this point Mike I just don't give a [ __ ] well there's not enough time
(2:00:17) to focus on it yeah yeah i mean we're I'm I'm always busy as you I mean Jim
(2:00:23) Bob will tell you I'm always busy on the phone with some creator or somebody you know trying to trying to get through
(2:00:29) something uh every every single day so it's um it's it's just the the nature of
(2:00:36) uh of this business but yeah ultimately I think that you guys and the Crucible crew and this and you
(2:00:42) know all of the it's not it's not just the Crucible or Andrew Wilson it's a huge conglomeration of people who are
(2:00:49) all working together to kind of beat beat the [ __ ] out of this whole thing you know what I mean and and I will say
(2:00:56) that you guys are doing a really good job you know every time I go on now I go
(2:01:02) online on YouTube there's somebody who is taking on a feminist on one of these
(2:01:07) platforms and just completely destroying them and it's maybe it's you or maybe it's Jake or maybe even Brian Atlas is
(2:01:14) is diving into that more and more right uh even Jay Dyer I see him tangling up
(2:01:20) with feminist Christians more and more i said you know like I just see the the culture there shifting to people really
(2:01:26) just kind of bludgeoning this ideology and trying to you know kind of drag its bloody carcass and throw it in the
(2:01:33) [ __ ] dumpster bin of history where it belongs right yeah siak says "You and Andrew are gyocentrics who think men
(2:01:40) should protect provide privilege the weak quote women also can you uh define
(2:01:46) masculinity?" Well I think your first statement is a contradiction we couldn't possibly be gyocentric if we're the ones
(2:01:52) protecting and providing and providing privilege it would be the opposite yeah it would be the that would be the opposite yeah so uh gyocentrism would be
(2:02:01) the um the hyperfocus on um not just uh
(2:02:07) you know women but on some type of coupling activity with women that the world needs to revolve around women
(2:02:14) that's not what the case is the case in fact is the opposite that women have a
(2:02:20) place in society which should be an honored place right but it shouldn't be in the position of authority right
(2:02:26) that's not where their position is supposed to be that'd be the opposite of gyocentrism right and it's not a value position
(2:02:32) either our our position doesn't state that there's a value difference especially especially from a Christian
(2:02:38) paradigm it's just that there's a duty difference and because there's a duty difference there's a different place in
(2:02:44) the hierarchy in the positions in society in the family in the church altogether so it's certainly not
(2:02:51) no sorry go ahead entailment of your position too uh chatter would actually be you're just an egalitarian so your
(2:02:58) entire your entire mindset is like no duties no nothing for anybody right
(2:03:04) we're just we just have an even playing field and it's like well that's just not ever going to be the case yeah it just
(2:03:09) can't happen uh Turd Ferguson $5 uh what's your take on the it's assumed that the man has to move out if uh the
(2:03:16) wife wants a divorce the husband didn't cheat the wife just wants um I don't
(2:03:21) know what to think of that i don't I don't really explore the that kind of I I think that's more legal in the end
(2:03:28) than some sort of like cultural phenomenon but I could be wrong andrew you can uh talk about that if you want
(2:03:35) uh the question is yeah the question is why is it assumed essentially the man has to move out if the wife wants a
(2:03:41) divorce even if there's no fault it's just it's just geared toward the women i I'm saying it's probably mostly legal
(2:03:48) which involves Yeah that was mostly Yeah correct that was mostly done by the um
(2:03:54) the re the court reforms which happened which uh which would give defaults to
(2:03:59) women before it would men um there are specific law sets for that i don't remember what they're called off top of
(2:04:05) my head but um but that's where a lot of that culture became informed by that like okay if I get a divorce you have to
(2:04:12) leave you know the idea is like the the law is going to side with me anyway so
(2:04:17) that's not the case anymore you know and uh men's rights advocates have done a
(2:04:23) lot to turn that around um and yeah you don't you don't have to leave now now
(2:04:28) the [ __ ] can get out right and you be like "Get out of here you [ __ ] right get out of here you get out of here." Yeah you you get out of here you go to the
(2:04:34) shed uh Jessica says this is Jordan's longer thing if you ever date a Protestant girl they want you to lead
(2:04:40) them spiritually as long as their idea of Christianity which means they want to lead yeah that's a good point if that's
(2:04:46) the case they don't actually hold the Christian view of being led now I've reversed this and asks a similar
(2:04:53) question like if your friend is a Protestant um and his wife is leaning
(2:05:00) toward orthodoxy and wants to go in that direction is she even from a general Christian view is she obligated to
(2:05:07) follow the man into Protestantism even though it's false with the hopes that his heart will change and he'll find the
(2:05:13) truth i actually don't know the answer to that question i feel like in the short term yes it's probably best for
(2:05:18) the marriage for the woman to submit even to uh follow a man who's in a
(2:05:24) heterodox position with the hopes that he'll be influenced toward in this case
(2:05:29) orthodoxy but I I wouldn't know how to manage that like even if my opinion is right or wrong I I actually wouldn't
(2:05:36) know how to um to engage with that if that was my friend i would just be like I don't even know i don't even What What
(2:05:42) would your take on that Andrew be uh being if it was reversed
(2:05:47) yeah I think um I think what would happen is uh she would go to her priest
(2:05:53) or she would go to her parish and um try to get assisted help that way for to
(2:05:59) make those types of determinations so um for one thing the reason that this
(2:06:06) is um the the reason that you're not supposed to marry non-Orthodox women as
(2:06:11) an Orthodox is so that things like this don't don't happen or vice versa mhm the idea there being that there this this
(2:06:18) type of conflict doesn't occur if if you're not marrying external
(2:06:24) the denomination and by the way you don't want your house divided over which teachings to teach your children and
(2:06:29) this kind of thing but this does happen this does happen um
(2:06:35) it has created division in many homes and massive problems and it becomes um
(2:06:41) it becomes something that generally the uh community becomes involved in in this case it' be you know the the wife's
(2:06:47) parish would become involved try to counsel them try to assist try to figure out something like this yeah but it
(2:06:53) could be the case that in some instances the priest advises to go ahead and you
(2:06:58) know follow the husband but that not to conform to the actual heterodox position
(2:07:04) or it could be that he gives other prescriptives for it or something like this each each case would have to be
(2:07:09) taken on case by case basis yeah I would say that there's like I don't want to call it a downside ultimately it's it's
(2:07:15) good that the technology and and online uh you know accessibility we have is
(2:07:22) actually giving people a chance to explore uh orthodoxy um but there is
(2:07:28) like this other symptom whereas that means that an individual in this case a a woman could find orthodoxy and pursue
(2:07:35) it you know uh adjacent or parallel to her husband not finding it and not
(2:07:41) following it so you run into these interesting pathways that didn't really exist in this way in the past you
(2:07:48) wouldn't have this predicament at least in this particular way you might have a similar predicament where a town you
(2:07:54) know you meet someone of a different town and the town has a a culture that's not um conducive to the that such as
(2:08:02) life and you you know the the idea that you can give a prescription to any type
(2:08:07) of micro detail in a person's relationship or any sort of division which may arise due to conflicting
(2:08:13) beliefs is absurd right yeah it's like it's not possible to do there's going to be unique challenges which are
(2:08:20) associated with every single relationship you know the the idea for instance of like okay what if a man is
(2:08:28) in extraordinary pain and he wants to end his own life um should his wife obey
(2:08:33) him right right it's like well no I think that at that point
(2:08:40) um you know you're going to you're going to have to have uh community support come in and there's going to have to be
(2:08:47) some kind of assistance with these various ideas and um you know like that's going to be a very unique
(2:08:54) challenge to that particular couple you know what I mean but that's what church that's what that's what being part of
(2:09:00) the church and church authority is about is that that you have community to assist in dealing with those major
(2:09:06) issues you know what I mean yeah and um and and what like what more can you ask
(2:09:12) for than that like that every single unique challenge has some type of
(2:09:17) redress which is already predetermined it's like that's [ __ ] ridiculous and impossible well it's just as ridiculous
(2:09:24) and and Yeah and secular society could never offer that in a million years right so why would the idea be that
(2:09:30) religious society would need to yeah yeah i was going to add that like like it's not even the case if you know you
(2:09:37) you join the church uh willfully with your uh spouse and and your whole family
(2:09:43) that suddenly you know all of your problems go away anyway so it's like you still have to deal with life so like you
(2:09:48) said such is life well Emanuel $100 says "Uh after a few months of post office
(2:09:54) journeys I finally received the ultimate print it's great." Oh that's awesome well Emanuel did you find yourself where
(2:09:59) you are in that print by the way uh I hope you did um both $4.99 andrew do you
(2:10:05) anticipate you know what speaking of that you [ __ ] Jim Bob how where's where's all my free swag [ __ ] i want
(2:10:11) free swag oh you want books and stickers what the [ __ ] what am I i'm chop [ __ ]
(2:10:16) liver over here well I just they sold out so fast and I was like "Well [ __ ] that guy what is What does he need a
(2:10:22) piece of paper?" You know what it is Andrew i just don't see you valuing like things like that so it just didn't occur
(2:10:28) to me i'm like he doesn't care about a [ __ ] print where's he going to put it in a drawer somewhere whatever you know
(2:10:34) what I mean what do you give a [ __ ] you don't give a [ __ ] about a piece of paper dude you know I don't I don't I don't
(2:10:41) like your presupposition you don't have a [ __ ]
(2:10:47) um what is like what is your epistemic claim here i'll send you a claim about
(2:10:53) me i'll send you a special one uh I've got a couple of extra that are that are
(2:10:59) the special artist print yeah I'm going to draw a dick on your I'm going to draw a dick on your head yeah you're in
(2:11:05) you're you're in the print i'm just going to draw a dick on your head um
(2:11:11) um both And Andrew said uh this is for Andrew uh do you anticipate a new school of political debaters commentators
(2:11:17) contending with likes of you JB you mean from the opposite side i think he's asking grounded foundational points are
(2:11:23) you talking both and opposite or more the same so the I think the opposition
(2:11:30) is in decadence right now and um and they're in decay one thing that you have
(2:11:37) to be able to do which the left has always had trouble with going all the way back to Air America Radio trying to
(2:11:44) compete with you know Rush Limbaugh and Michael Savage and uh Sean Hannity and
(2:11:49) all those guys they they they don't entertain they don't entertain so
(2:11:55) there's no reason why you have to but it's it's because they want to have a
(2:12:01) perceived like a perception that they're super highly intellectual right
(2:12:06) and so so often they're just terrible [ __ ] entertainers and most leftists are terrible entertainers and so um they
(2:12:13) they think for some reason that if you're an entertaining person this also necessarily means you're a stupid one
(2:12:19) and that's a really big mistake and they run into this constantly where they're like "Wait this guy's really fun funny
(2:12:26) and will kick my ass logically." Like that's a that's a hard thing to contend with jim Bob ultimately is a comedian
(2:12:32) right he's a he's a he's a comic he does uh uh comedic art and he does even
(2:12:38) standup comedy which by the way that was really funny thank you um he does he does you know that's what he does but
(2:12:44) it's like does that somehow disqualify him from being a legitian no no and so
(2:12:51) it's just kind of funny to me that there's an instant discount based around credentialism and then they get their
(2:12:57) their asses stomped and they're like "What what just happened what just happened how did this happen?" That is
(2:13:02) crazy that that's missing even though you'd say like um the entertainment
(2:13:08) world in general happens to lean progressive so it's like you look at just the the the industry of
(2:13:14) entertainment is led by this but they don't they're not using that well with
(2:13:20) their argumentation right and so that what's interesting is the reverse is that if you're you develop your logic
(2:13:26) and if you become a decent logician that could actually improve your your art
(2:13:32) your comedy whatever you're doing you can you could actually use it both ways but um the reason that the meme the left
(2:13:39) can't meme is a thing and you could add your two cents on is that they don't really have a foundation for their logic
(2:13:45) like they don't have a a thing that's unchanging for truth so they can argue
(2:13:51) their memes and meme well they have to do these top Well you bring you bring up I think we were talking about this we
(2:13:57) touched on this um when we were feeding alligators fishing oh right right so um
(2:14:02) I think we I think we actually did touch on this briefly in that trip but you're
(2:14:07) right the left but I I say the left can't meme because all of their memes have to do with right-wing hypocrisy mhm
(2:14:14) that's that's how they meme um their memes don't have anything to do with why
(2:14:20) you should do the things they want just why you shouldn't do the things that the
(2:14:25) right wants cuz you know they're hypocrites right that's their kind of their major uh and and and pointing out
(2:14:33) um oh yeah you know that Trump's a family values guy and then it shows you know a picture of like three women that
(2:14:39) he's been with or something like this and they go haha well it's like well okay maybe the first
(2:14:46) time I see that it's kind of funny you know but by the 3,000th variation of it you're just like just shut the [ __ ] up
(2:14:53) with this you know what I mean yeah um but if they could if if if they could
(2:14:58) point to something which was indicative in reality for what people should do in a satirical way that would be [ __ ]
(2:15:04) great and hilarious you know what I mean but they don't yeah they just point to that's actually interesting because
(2:15:11) where the right wing fails is when they just go to can you imagine Trump did
(2:15:17) this and that's that has its limitations too once you see that once you're like are you going to do this forever the
(2:15:23) it's the hypocrisy angle yeah so they're both just Well that's hypocrisy because if if Trump did this you would be up in
(2:15:30) arms right um and so the the memes on both sides well from from that weaker
(2:15:36) side is this very idea of you know you're a hypocrite and this and that but when your your satire doesn't often
(2:15:44) point at hypocrisy though it points at inconsistency
(2:15:49) you know what I mean that's most of your satire is pointing at inconsistency from their view and consistency from
(2:15:55) your view right and so instead of the perception of just you're a hypocrite
(2:16:01) and so that it's it's much more effective and it's far more hilarious yeah yeah inconsistency is way better to
(2:16:07) point to Carrie more $5 uh five gifted memberships thank you so much Carrie appreciate that uh Abby Wong Yang uh $50
(2:16:16) huge super chat from Abby thank you so much Abby pierce oh wait we got Vene one
(2:16:22) second vene Jimming Bob and Andrew Wilning the left only make memes about
(2:16:29) right-wing hypocrisy just like how atheists only make anti-Christian content we Hindus are safe from
(2:16:36) criticism praise Vishnu oh thank you Vene i appreciate you saying that um
(2:16:41) here's to your dono goal keep up the content i enjoy listening to these debates from you and Andrew thank you
(2:16:46) Abby i really appreciate you're you're always a very generous don donor i really appreciate that pwix $5 for
(2:16:53) Andrew what was your primary motivation for starting The Crucible uh was it a singular moment or event that inspired
(2:17:00) you to enter Discourse uh well I wasn't always with The
(2:17:06) Crucible and the channel I was with before uh broke up so I made The
(2:17:11) Crucible by necessity because I wanted to continue what I was doing so that was the the primary reason and it started as
(2:17:19) a debate platform where I would host debates more than anything else and then over time it became more centered around
(2:17:25) my views as I would often step in and do debates if I couldn't find people and it
(2:17:31) just kind of evolved from there so um but I always from the very beginning on the Crucible did reviews and reactions
(2:17:37) and political commentary and things like this so um it was uh you know I guess
(2:17:43) you could say it was a passion of mine yeah you got cancelled from an an other
(2:17:49) it was a primary debate platform or or what was it what's the platform it was
(2:17:54) like a It was like a Who cares i don't even matter um but yeah you were always
(2:18:00) debating though that's the That's the key you were debating before correct debate channel uh Jeff Bros $5 spiritual
(2:18:06) battle is real to me andrew and Jim Bob are warriors that use logic and human level arguments to bring others to God
(2:18:12) and Jesus well we can only hope um I hope I don't push more people away uh in
(2:18:18) some of these engagements but um vegan runner $1.99 i'm Genesis uh or in
(2:18:25) Genesis I assume it is clear that Elohim was once a man that's really funny um a
(2:18:31) Mormon Mormon take i'm glad you wrote that vegan runner our resident Mormon because next week Wednesday I'll have
(2:18:39) Jay Dyer on and we will do a very comedic but also indepth uh analysis
(2:18:45) reputation and summary of Mormonism which I've never done before um it gets wild i don't know though Jim Bob i don't
(2:18:51) you know I think they need to send me more super chats there's not a lot of grift going on yeah yeah you guys should
(2:18:56) definitely Yes definitely be sending Let me let me make a a quick appeal to the grift do it without the griff this great
(2:19:04) and wondrous entertainment does not exist and so we're going to take a moment to take an obscene profit break
(2:19:11) where you guys open your wallets and send the cash in and we're going to hold the stream hostage until you do uh I
(2:19:17) don't know exactly how we're going to do that maybe uh Jim Bob can play like a griff song on his guitar or something
(2:19:22) like that but I feel like you guys deserve no more conversation until until I see the wallets opening yep pure
(2:19:29) silence over here um speaking of Grift uh Andrew we put $100 on Rachel's
(2:19:36) madebyjimob.com account for the print so you get a get the print i know Rachel

(2:20:21) value enslaved by Truth $5 i think this might be Enslave by Truth's first ever super chat over here in 15 years of me
(2:20:28) having this $20 is because Andrew is a mean pooping head worse than Jay Dyer
(2:20:34) yep you got a Venechat said I she sent $20 just because you're a mean poopy head worse
(2:20:41) than Jay Dyer she says um Enslave by Truth $5 outlining our enslavement

(2:21:58) super chats stepfire $99 that's what I'm talking about stepfire thank you so much
(2:22:03) love the content don't force my hand again andrew all Andrew can hang out
(2:22:09) anytime in in my in my defense Stefart um Jim Bob he is [ __ ] terrible at uh
(2:22:19) at shilling his channel and at taking moments key moments where I um you know
(2:22:26) he's he is he is running a business he has a household to support this type of thing he does uh you know he needs to
(2:22:32) take a bit of a profit break every once in a while he's got to make got to make some cash so sometimes when I'm on a
(2:22:37) stream he graciously allows me to come on and view my nonsense um sometimes I
(2:22:43) do full rank for the grift because uh because it's good for the channel yeah
(2:22:49) yep and very effective you are so you know um both and $1.99 step up your
(2:22:56) Griff JB Jordan Lofrren 50 uh $5 so another $50 bob chat coming in and
(2:23:02) another $10 birthday many years aanious thank you
(2:23:08) Athanasius yeah 44 now so you'll see it in my beard um Jordan $5 do you all have
(2:23:14) any desire to try to get Bo Rob to start doing priest up he's great at arguing but a lot of his arguments are about
(2:23:20) hypocrisy not foundation i don't know Andrew i don't think he'll get too deep
(2:23:25) into philosophy he seems to be pretty comfort comforted and rooted in doesn't need to we need guys we need like guys
(2:23:33) like Rob to also operate on the same kind of normal discourse level for politics um having the deep entrenched
(2:23:41) knowledge base of the inner workings and goings on at the political level and to argue those things at a at a um a less
(2:23:49) than philosophical level is brilliant rhetoric and also is very effective at changing minds he doesn't need to dive
(2:23:55) in to the philosophy aspect it's not as important yeah he's also pretty ideal
(2:24:01) for um bigger platforms like Piers Morgan where there are sound bites uh
(2:24:06) very effective uh sound bites that are produced and you can get points ac across without going to philosophical
(2:24:14) jargon um in fact it might even hinder him to get further into philosophy uh
(2:24:19) guy incognito $10 I remain unconvinced of the grift argument take my money thank you so much President
(2:24:26) Sundowner99 i miss the good old days of Andrew moderating it's a good teaching tool for these Dilla monkeys um
(2:24:34) moderation um do you miss moderating well I mean I I Well I mean I do
(2:24:39) moderate you know i still do moderate debates um I don't do it as much for me
(2:24:45) it's it's always a time issue me and Jim Bob talked about this many times privately that you know time is always
(2:24:51) my kind of my biggest enemy and um I don't get that many days off and when I
(2:24:57) do have a day off I end up usually just kind of working anyway and this is not to complain right I mean people would
(2:25:04) would kill to be in the same position that I'm in so I'm not complaining at all just pointing out that it's actually
(2:25:10) really difficult for me to uh moderate debates like I used to but for special occasions I'll still do that well it's
(2:25:17) just not the best use of your your time if you're a weapon like that's not the
(2:25:23) place to to put you necessarily that's more like leisure like when you want to hang out and drink a beer yeah you don't
(2:25:30) use the sword to make the sheets yeah yeah guy incognito $5 keep this train
(2:25:36) this donor train chug and choo choo [ __ ] thank you so much austin Tatilio $10 andrew has a gift for the
(2:25:42) grift he really does he really does um not to say it's not an a valid exchange
(2:25:48) of services for money it's just that he's he's just really good at it no it's not a it's not a valid exchange just
(2:25:54) give Just It should be more it should be more yeah it's not a valid exchange like
(2:26:00) just just give me your [ __ ] money and just keep this channel going yeah just
(2:26:06) give him the [ __ ] All right we're almost at 50 we got nine more you guys nine more i'm gonna I'm gonna hold to it
(2:26:12) we got nine more get them in get them in get them in get them in i'll I'll shut
(2:26:18) the whole machine down no more songs no more funnies no more
(2:26:24) animation none of it like like 25 people who leave they're like "Fuck the griff
(2:26:29) the griff damn the griff." Jim Bob too yeah um the Crucible will take overtake
(2:26:37) MD well maybe the culture doing life i I talked about this with someone else recently that it's already sort of if
(2:26:44) the Crucible is like a a wave and there's a ripple the ripple has already
(2:26:49) taken over MDD and I don't mean that like you know against James like he has
(2:26:55) no control i'm just saying that the the culture has already infiltrated the chat and the direction of the of the uh
(2:27:02) channel what they need now is just better production and better um better
(2:27:08) execution of the debates and that's not a dig at anyone it's just that that's just the case it just needs to be better
(2:27:14) i think it'll it might get I think it might get better too you know so if I can help I will call Andrew the
(2:27:22) Wambulance right call ambulance $5 thank you a gorilla polus grifted one uh made
(2:27:28) by Jim Bob membership thank you so much Lauren another $5 we're almost there seven more y'all seven more get them
(2:27:36) in i'll take back all your Yeah I'll take Atlas look at David Atlas throwing in the 10
(2:27:44) yeah there we go there we go David uh yeah I'll take back all your Bob avatars i'll just take them back i'll flag them
(2:27:50) for uh for copyright infringement if I see them [ __ ] dirt bags just give him the
(2:27:57) money just give him the What the [ __ ] give him the money what are you doing give him the money hand it over hand it over production production and audio is
(2:28:04) pathetic on MD i just don't understand why they started with like the not just Zoom but the Google Meets it's like
(2:28:11) Streamyard sucks for certain dynamic things audio-wise but in general you can
(2:28:17) use Streamyard and it'll be fine um so hopefully they figure that out um Taint
(2:28:24) nothing $4.99 damn you Andrew take my money yeah thank you thank you Taint yes sir i'm just going to take a sound bite
(2:28:31) of Andrew from this stream and just play it as a stream deck um asset you know
(2:28:37) what I mean he says breaks like this is robbery yes it is that's right yes it is
(2:28:44) tv is this how patriarchy works yes yes it is uh Griff Master $2 super chats
(2:28:51) don't count superhat doesn't count give it back don't count um Brandon $10 thank
(2:28:56) you so much good to see you both on a stream together if all come full circle we're all here chatting it up with Wes
(2:29:02) yeah that would be funny allegedly in jail for facing something like 20 years in prison i highly doubt it's going to be 20 he probably wishes though he He
(2:29:09) probably misses it don't you think i think he really misses it how much he talks up prison even in your the debacle
(2:29:17) we had with him he was just It seemed like he really missed it is this robbery yeah yeah hand it
(2:29:24) over give me all your money hand it over yeah yeah give it up
(2:29:29) give it up incognito $5 yep yeah that's right
(2:29:36) palpatine dark side
(2:29:41) freezes him up late glad to be here when are we going to get a team up debate and Andrew i don't know if that would be
(2:29:47) effective it would be fun for us but uh Andrew doesn't need a partner vegan one was pretty good yeah Vegan one was
(2:29:53) pretty good it's almost like it's just I don't even know i mean I would do it it would be I you know what I would do i
(2:30:00) would do that for a meme debate uh more than than because it's just it's
(2:30:05) unnecessary it's unnecessary it would be like too would almost like be like
(2:30:11) drones um but do a debate on the uh on
(2:30:17) Star Wars Empire versus uh versus non-Empire who was right that would be a lot of fun that would be fun there's a
(2:30:23) lot of jokes in there i think a fun debate would be best but I mean that's even your experience if you were to
(2:30:29) choose Andrew uh you would debate one versus one or one versus even six before
(2:30:34) you did two versus two or two versus six you would prefer one right i would
(2:30:40) always prefer I always prefer out i think the audience would too you know i don't I think that's a it works well for
(2:30:46) some people uh Andrew is almost as Canadian as MDD wow that is those are
(2:30:52) fighting words right there bro no way a guy named Goldstein sent you money no
(2:30:57) [ __ ] way no way bro that didn't just happen dude that's funny i'm teasing Dan
(2:31:03) dan I'm teasing relax bro there's a funny joke calm down Dan
(2:31:10) um Brian Wander $5 uh you're live on my commute to work still live on my drive
(2:31:15) home relentless sir thank you very much keep the grift going yeah I'm streaming much longer what's funny is that I
(2:31:22) always uh once in a while I'll talk to Andrew about you know uh directions to
(2:31:27) go in what to focus on it's just funny our last conversation uh I was talking about just not streaming and just making
(2:31:34) [ __ ] and and we were both like excited about it literally two days after I start doing five hour streams it's like
(2:31:43) like you you just never I don't know you just never know where it's going to go funny how that works isn't it yeah
(2:31:49) yeah it's funny bombs moms $10 thank you so much uh said nothing um goal well
(2:31:57) Emanuel says "Thank you so much Dan." Gold Goldstein uh getting grifted my Andrew across
(2:32:05) multiple time zones and platforms what the hell take my money i will take it stepfire another $20 thank you you got
(2:32:12) to stop i got kids to feed um another $100 from Gully 46 thank you so much wow
(2:32:20) very generous of you says nothing just says it with his wallet i appreciate that can I Can I uh can I can I respond
(2:32:27) to Steph says "You got to stop got kids to feed." Okay if it comes down to Jim Bob's kids or your kids I'm sorry bro
(2:32:32) it's got to be Jim Bob's kids like that's the way it's got to be true and like what part of that are you not getting it's got to be his i mean
(2:32:40) you know you even need you know just have more just have more bro yeah just that's just Star Wars is the was a
(2:32:47) prequel to Star Trek oh is that a Star Is that uh Oh okay so is that in defense of Star Wars right because there's the
(2:32:54) Star Wars Star Trek uh you know war which is better which is I mean Star
(2:32:59) Trek came out before Star Wars but Right okay right that doesn't make any sense but Star
(2:33:07) Wars yeah there's now Wait you hit your goal here didn't you Jim Bob i did i hit my goal celebrate oh my god so like I
(2:33:15) promised you guys are going to continue to get content just not with me cuz I'm leaving have a wonderful day i'm glad
(2:33:20) that we were able to cry all you [ __ ] and I'm not staying to give you any more [ __ ] day kiss my ass have a great day
(2:33:27) Jim take care of yourself god bless you man uh step for another $50 can't argue with that thank you so much for that
(2:33:33) Stepher i really appreciate that um now uh appreciate Andrew coming over what a
(2:33:40) great conversation and I'm going to actually have to rename the stream given that the we did very minimal prep work
(2:33:47) we did some but it was more of a glorious conversation much needed and uh
(2:33:53) hope it was valuable with that said uh I do believe that there is some opposition
(2:33:59) in the Discord um I think still maybe I don't know you guys could let me know if
(2:34:06) there is uh we can get into that if you want now
(2:34:13) um but thank you so much everyone for all the support and the um temporary
(2:34:20) grift moment you know the uh as he calls it hey Java what's up i actually dis
(2:34:27) Yeah hold on a second hold on a second um but there's a hypothetical you posed earlier which I had extreme contention with especially if you follow like a
(2:34:33) Christian view hold on a second um sorry my OBS says it's disconnecting so I'm
(2:34:38) going to have a just like a f 15 second um delay it's going to reconnect in a
(2:34:44) second was wouldn't it cause the same effect where in the end it would both both of them would cause the downfall of
(2:34:49) the institution of marriage which is the critique against liberalism wait say that again you cut out the first part
(2:34:55) about that oh your mic like turned really weird understand why either way
(2:35:00) yeah go ahead say the Oh yeah sorry okay you hear me now yeah yeah say the hypothetical again yeah so the
(2:35:07) hypothetical was does it uh if for example women were able to have robots
(2:35:12) that protected them from men and were able to enforce women's rights uh men would also equally have robots to take
(2:35:19) the the primary role of women which is to reproduce i said uh if that were to
(2:35:24) happen and they were only to select to reproduce men and not women uh the male society would then have a degragation of
(2:35:30) the institution of marriage unless you believe in a Christian worldview you can have marriage with a robot though it has no soul
(2:35:37) oh there's Yeah there's a lot of things in there i'm not sure uh did someone pose the hypothetical where robots
(2:35:44) replace human beings from the Christian position or are you just saying that
(2:35:49) hypothetically if there was a society that robots replaced men as the
(2:35:55) application of force the ones enforcing laws and and policing people etc well
(2:36:01) this this was posed this was an argumentation that you know Andrew provided and I said that you know do you
(2:36:07) recall what I'm talking about at all specifically about robots you was discussing yeah the Yeah I was saying
(2:36:13) that the the people who don't like the uh who don't who fail to provide an equalizer for men and women will then go
(2:36:20) to technology and they'll say "Well robot robots then uh start uh birthing
(2:36:25) people is that the other aspect?" Like there's anyone hearing this or Oh is it
(2:36:31) still choppy it's really bad okay okay yeah at this point sometimes my stream
(2:36:37) gets choppy for some reason by the way I'm I'm back to respond to this oh there we go there we go digital like four bit
(2:36:44) okay oh hello BTF okay no you're straw maning you're strong yeah you're straw maning the [ __ ] out of the position so
(2:36:51) the position wasn't what ought to happen it's a descriptive what's going to happen so
(2:36:59) so you want to reformat it then um whatever your name is PhD in logic at um
(2:37:05) uh what happens if the transhumanist future that you so desperately want
(2:37:13) um and my claim is that Christians would uh be opposed to uh artificial wombs and
(2:37:22) things like this so I don't I what you did was you made up a hypothetical that
(2:37:28) was never made i mean well okay even even then wait even then you're I think then your description is even wrong if you're trying to talk about its
(2:37:34) applicability and how it would work in the real world uh in the li in the liberal yeah in the liberal framework it
(2:37:39) would then entail that there would still be regular normal relationships in the transhumanist future position uh through
(2:37:45) authority of the robots because robots would be greater than men also that's just something you're stop one at a time
(2:37:51) right so that's incorrect who postulated that women would be able to use enforcement through robotics that's
(2:37:58) something your you did it was actually within your hypothetical
(2:38:04) dollar robot that they make it's not a bill it's it's it's it doesn't cost a billion dollars you're
(2:38:09) taking into R&D account yeah research and development because right now those types of robots which can exist for for
(2:38:17) things as as complex as rights enforcement we are decades and decades away from that that's not even true wait
(2:38:23) what do you want true wait hold on wait if you look at the then I mean then are are you show me show me show me where it
(2:38:30) cost around $30,000 to make so bull bull [ __ ] show me show me the link lying sack
(2:38:36) of [ __ ] i'm not Wait it's either you think I'm lying or you think I'm just not saying what's not telling the truth
(2:38:42) yes on purpose which would be a lie so go ahead it's not a lie i mean if you think that Tesla actually does no longer
(2:38:47) has a you know massive valuation i don't I don't want to hear your babble i want to Okay well you have to give me a
(2:38:53) second man but Okay and I'm going to give you a second i understand you work in robotics but it's not like or worked
(2:38:59) previous yeah no no you're nowhere near a rights enforcement robot rob show me
(2:39:08) by the way you'd still have to have a whole body of people enforcing the enforcement if you even granted robot
(2:39:14) enforcement it's not like it's not like it just does its thing on Yeah i'm not
(2:39:19) even going to humor humor that until we get through his point
(2:39:25) let's get through the empir the empirical claims first that there's we're on the verge of rights enforcement robots for women that cost 30 grand i
(2:39:32) can't [ __ ] wait to see 30 grand that's that's hilarious uh I posted in the side chat uh this is within the
(2:39:38) recent time in the future basically what it's showing is that the Optimus robot already has the capabilities to do mean
(2:39:44) chill out i don't I don't want your interpretation don't care about your interpretation yet i just want I want to give it to you you don't have to listen
(2:39:50) to it okay that's nice can you just give me a second first to actually see it
(2:39:55) you can't ed yeah where did you put it it's in the
(2:40:00) side chat in the VC i don't know what's the chat vc side chat yeah you can DM it
(2:40:05) to Andrew i don't see live stream VC the is it the voice text or the voice voice
(2:40:11) or which one bt voice side chat but yeah I mean I'm willing to even just engage
(2:40:17) with the hypothetical just purely through the hypothetical but but you can look at the empirics of this dude stop
(2:40:23) stop talking so I can is it in the what does the room say that you put it in what is it actually atheism/ evolution
(2:40:30) and it's in the side chat and I can post it like 10 times can you put it in the VC text chat it is the VC text chat here
(2:40:37) i'll put it above is it in there did someone put it in i put it there vc checks yeah
(2:40:46) there andrew this is uh Justin Henley speaking i sent it to you on a direct Discord message that helps i'm looking
(2:40:52) at it now okay
(2:40:58) but indicated the cost to train the robot could be around 50 billion so 50 billion to train okay uh
(2:41:07) let's see we revealed that we were robots that's a
(2:41:12) pretty small amount this is really this is [ __ ] hilarious bro so let's let's get the tasks that this thing can do it
(2:41:19) can do a humanlike walk it can explore unseen spaces tap for visual cues find
(2:41:24) its charging station pick up heavy things it can start to navigate uneven
(2:41:30) terrain not quite but it can start to and it can respond to requests and hand out items such a robot would cost
(2:41:37) $20,000 can you tell me how this robot could ever enforce women's rights you
(2:41:43) doofus so so this is within the Wait hold on Andrew and Andrew you [ __ ] don't andrew this is actually this is
(2:41:50) like this is being facious and I'll tell you the reason why because this cuz within the same expectation or in time
(2:41:56) period of artificial wombs would be implemented within the rate that robotics are scaling as you should know
(2:42:01) cuz you're in the industry this would be exponentially higher uh particularly considering Wait don't I let you I let
(2:42:08) you I let you finish i let you finish industry is garbage i didn't ask a question it's not garbage you just
(2:42:13) literally garbage you deem it to be garbage because you don't want to listen you literally You literally gave me I
(2:42:18) get it you're not talking to one of your drones you gave me a garbage you gave me a garbage study can
(2:42:25) you The robot is literally only capable
(2:42:30) of maybe handing you stuff dude right do you understand what you gave me
(2:42:36) here so you keep you keep doing this thing right now where I'm telling you that there's already robots that are able to complete menial tasks that's
(2:42:42) what I said prior and I said at the rate of which the both these industries are increasing artificial wombs don't exist
(2:42:48) yet you can't have a baby within an artificial womb and have it survive that's just not true and also that comes across with the issue we don't have the
(2:42:55) we don't have the technology yet even crisper and etc don't have the the technology yet to do genetic
(2:43:00) randomization uh second of all I was going to say uh when it comes to
(2:43:05) robotics it's scaling at a rate much faster considering that AI is able to have more
(2:43:11) implared to what like a traditional computer um with just like the coding of
(2:43:17) uh you know calculating variables and such ai will be able to take on a much more interactive role and much more
(2:43:22) leading role within robotics yeah so okay so I'll now I'll address
(2:43:27) each one of these at the same time one no you're wrong so the problem is with
(2:43:32) complex tasks especially robotics complex tasks uh you can get them to do complex things that's true it's getting
(2:43:39) them to do easy things for humans that's really hard like did you notice it said that maybe it could navigate uneven
(2:43:46) terrain maybe at some point that for human beings is not problematic it's not
(2:43:51) it's not an issue right however you know like calculating you know a complex math
(2:43:58) problem that is uh complex for human beings machines are really good at doing that kind of stuff they're really not
(2:44:04) very good at doing any of the normal stuff that we're able to do so the thing
(2:44:09) is hang on stop bro my turn i just let you talk i thought you were done there it's okay i thought I thought you're done well clearly Well clearly I'm not
(2:44:15) cuz I'm still talking so anyway um this what you sent me is uh showing the same
(2:44:23) type of robotics technology that we had in the '8s okay this stuff that you showed me okay Johnny 5 still alive
(2:44:30) short circuit type [ __ ] that you're showing me here and by the way even those robots are more sophisticated than
(2:44:35) that robot so the thing is is like no and when we're looking at artificial wombs we're much closer to that
(2:44:42) technology than we are a rights enforcement robot that can autonomously enforce women's rights with force do you
(2:44:49) realize like do you understand that
(2:45:04) no what I said is that the robot you sent me Yeah the robot you sent me right
(2:45:09) was no is no more complex than Johnny 5 it is more complex because it's able to
(2:45:14) say anything about the technology of robots not being more advanced now than it was in the 80s no he just set it up
(2:45:21) i'm speak I'm speak I'm speaking in particular to this specific robot okay so in this in particularly this robot is
(2:45:27) able to complete task of which your Johnny 5 robot wasn't able to do it is able to take on complex variables hold
(2:45:33) on it's able to take on Johnny okay so Johnny So Johnny 5 right so Johnny 5 can
(2:45:39) analyze a car and decide which part to replace yes johnny 5 not only that but what was capable was capable of human
(2:45:46) speech it's a movie you don't a movie wait hold on hold on so would you then
(2:45:51) be saying it's irrelevant of what the movie thinks yeah but listen these things don't exist
(2:45:58) the the envisionment right of what robots are capable or not capable of
(2:46:03) doing is purely from the fictional aspect right now because we don't have robots which are capable of rights
(2:46:09) enforcement so yeah uh over on the stream side it's choppy am I choppy
(2:46:15) though because it could be just the Discord and it could be that so many people are piled into the channel right
(2:46:21) now over there i might have to boot some people from uh Discord uh if that's the case I'm not
(2:46:29) sure though uh if it's buffering and it's me like if you tell me I'm
(2:46:34) buffering then it's not Discord so can you guys hear me and not I just muted
(2:46:40) the Discord so am I choppy now
(2:46:46) or what in the tab I refreshed and it
(2:46:52) worked yeah yeah it's cutting out i just need to know from your guys' position am
(2:46:58) I cutting out now that I've deafened the Discord yes or
(2:47:08) no lost Lost the chat too yeah it's annoying
(2:47:13) annoying [Music] whatever sounds like I'm behind on the
(2:47:20) chat too like by a lot i don't know what's happening i just don't know what's
(2:47:27) happening here is it back buffering
(2:47:35) bad i don't know it's funny we're talking about technology we're talking about whether or not robots can enforce
(2:47:42) rights and we can't even we can't even get a stream to work
(2:47:49) i know finance i know finance i I know finance so anyway so anyway just real quick okay just so you know I'm telling
(2:47:55) you what the futures in markets are predicting the futures markets are predicting AI futures markets are
(2:48:00) predicting artificial wombs futures markets are Fix the audio i don't know how to fix the
(2:48:06) audio i honestly don't know how to fix it
(2:48:12) i don't know what the what's broken about the audio if you guys can't hear this the thing maybe it's a server
(2:48:18) overload i still don't hear from you guys whether you can hear me directly can you hear me
(2:48:27) directly can you hear me am I cutting
(2:48:33) out that's why a lot of them say that's not what futures are vote futures are
(2:48:38) not betting on Tesla robot it's not betting at all it is betting that's what futures markets do they bet on the So
(2:48:45) people So you you think it's it's not betting but either way it's it's Anyway yes it's literally betting how is it not
(2:48:51) betting you're saying in the future this technology is going to be X so I'm going to invest that's like that's like a
(2:48:56) that's that's like a [ __ ] gambling term but that's like anyway it's every
(2:49:02) either way you you made a false claim wait hold on okay then why have long claim I've made okay then why is futures for Tesla's increased exponentially then
(2:49:09) because people are betting that Tesla will have uh viable products in both AI and and in automobiles no people
(2:49:16) actually priced in that the market's actually priced in that Tesla's going to underperform with in relation to their vehicles yeah and then they're going to
(2:49:22) overperform in things like AI what's your point oh okay then doesn't that also include with the Optimus robot
(2:49:28) plenty of people are very long i don't know what to do i actually don't know what to do at this
(2:49:33) point should I just end the stream hey if you guys want to continue the debate go over to Discord jump in i'm going to
(2:49:40) end the I'm going to end the stream good time to end the stream anyway okay I'm good yeah I just I'm getting
(2:49:48) mixed signals am I good is it good now it's good just happened again buffering
(2:49:54) again yeah I'm gonna end it it's too It's I'm gonna eat
(2:49:59) lunch it's fine now it's choppy for me no you're on no you're good now it's
(2:50:05) still choppy as hell it's not as bad i mean this is too much i'm just going to end
(2:50:11) it it's a great stream end it while it's good okay um with that said I'm going to do
(2:50:18) other creative things i have an animation to make i have to practice music i have to prepare for a debate um
(2:50:26) God bless you all adios see you next time
