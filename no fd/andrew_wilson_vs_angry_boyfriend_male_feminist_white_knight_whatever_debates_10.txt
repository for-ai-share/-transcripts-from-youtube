(1:30) criticisms of uh the show so Luke we're going to just have you start let us know

(1:42) start there so take it and then also for The Crucible crew who's watching I know

(1:47) that uh I've streamed last couple days been really busy uh traveling around uh make sure you send in those ttss

(1:54) remember the show is viewers supported and Brian graciously has allowed us to come back on into a studio so just

(2:01) wanted to throw that out there thank you Andrew appreciate it so uh go ahead what what you got yeah so I think it was

(2:08) about like what two weeks ago um uh my girlfriend at the time was coming on to the show and she at the time at the time

() 

(2:16) yeah no is that so she's still your girlfriend yeah she's still my girlfriend okay yeah okay no no I was

(2:21) just saying that at the time she was here and I she had been communicated she was invited on she accepted it was about

(2:26) 10: p.m. I think she was told at the time that she was going to be here till and uh I was waiting obviously and there

(2:32) was you know earlier arrangements in the morning and I remember thinking like you know this is going pretty long I was watching the stream and the longer and

(2:38) longer I watched it the more and more I started to see that a lot of the content seemed like it was taking advantage of

() 

(2:43) people that just you know didn't have all of their um logic and their their worldviews fully baked and it seemed

(2:49) like they were just being taken advantage of and then not really being presented with the truth upon their you

(2:55) know just being humiliated on camera and then on top of that too uh one of the criticisms I had as well too is that people were up very late uh including a

(3:01) mom I believe who had to step out and when people were asking for the show to end they were instead offered substances

(3:07) and they kept going and there was even um you there a lot of twitch chats I feel like that were uh not the most

(3:12) edifying and kind of degrading that were being read out and I felt like uh I believe the term I used was social

(3:17) trafficking um and that I felt like it was more exploitative than it was instructional or informative and so yeah

(3:23) that was the first criticism I had and I'd be curious to hear what you guys think about that sure so there's quite a

(3:29) bit there um let's start with social trafficking what is social trafficking I would say social trafficking is

(3:34) exploiting people despite you know being slightly less intellectual or less studied and then using that for money or

(3:41) for personal gain okay so it's taking advantage of stupid people yeah I'd say so okay so social trafficking just means

(3:48) I take advantage of dumb people for money okay got it and how would you quantify that like

(3:55) how would we know who's the stupid person who's the smart person the person who's feeling humil ated in front of a

(4:00) public audience okay that person yeah would it make any difference if that person sucked dick for money on camera

(4:06) as to the level of humiliation that I thought that they would be willing to accept Luke uh I'm not sure how to

(4:12) answer that hypothetical question could you use a different scenario no I I really can't use a different scenario

(4:17) let us assume the woman who you feel like is being humiliated sucks men's dicks on camera yeah do you think that I

(4:24) would think that her threshold for what you might consider humiliation might be slightly different than what you're considering a threshold for humiliation

(4:31) I think she already does feel humiliated in doing that yeah and I even if she says I absolutely under no circumstances

(4:36) feel humiliated by this I can't wait to get home and do it tonight I'm going to make thousands of dollars haaha I think we both know that it's not a fulfilling

(4:42) thing to do and I think you do internally feel convicted and humiliated by that yeah do you do you are you aware

(4:48) of the idea of prelest or person who is given over to the Demonic or reprobate mind that they could be fooled into

(4:55) believing that they're doing something which is fulfilling if you're referencing Romans 1 then yes but not the term you mention so so if you move

(5:01) over into this idea that these people you do realize there are people who just really like to be Repro baates they

(5:08) actually just like it they enjoy it yeah yeah is that in is that in scripture well do um do you disagree I honestly I

(5:17) don't think I can judge people's hearts um I think that's what the Bible says says you know wait until the word comes do you think there's some people Luke

(5:24) who like being scumbags do you think that they enjoy it honestly I think my responsibility is to repentance I feel

(5:30) like you're not answering the question Luke let me ask you again do you feel like there's some people who like being

(5:35) scumbags they just enjoy it they're deceived yeah I do okay so they like it so the thing is is like um when you say

(5:42) they're they look stupid what if you look stupid because you say something really stupid and it's pointed out hey

(5:49) you said something that's really [ __ ] stupid and aren't you supposed to feel stupid isn't that the idea I think the

(5:56) correct thing to do when someone does make themselves appear stupid and they're really confident and they're asserting it is to actually show them

() 

(6:01) the truth instead of just berate them and show that you're Superior to them when you have a worldview okay and it's

(6:07) false okay how do you switch your worldview without that one being shown to be wrong oh it will be shown to be

(6:12) wrong how how do you show it to be wrong how do you show worldview to be wrong by revealing the truth okay but but first

(6:19) you have to break the worldview down that is false in order to do that yeah sometimes you're going to have to risk

(6:24) offense and risk making them feel stupid absolutely and I think you guys do a great job of that here I think modern dating is largely destroying genen Z and

(6:32) a lot of especially girls my age and I think that's really good how you guys ask really probing questions to show the

(6:38) gaps in logic especially then I don't understand the criticism the criticism is Andrew made feel made woman feel dumb

(6:44) yes because I feel like afterwards you didn't present the truth and you instead double down and [ __ ] shamed her after she had already said that she felt

(6:50) bullied as a kid which which woman was this Nicolette oh the troll yeah the you mean the woman that came in here

(6:55) purposely to troll mhm yeah who was trying to derail the show on purpose in order to troll yeah oh you thought I

(7:01) should have revealed the truth to the troll mhm okay and and you think that the troll the woman who was here to

(7:06) troll because she was trolling yes uh you think that that would I would have revealed what what what would have been

(7:11) Luke's big reveal I want to hear it I think Christ I'm I'm sorry the reveal to the

(7:19) woman who said that she believed in Christ and was here to troll yes your

(7:24) big reveal would have been the thing that she already conceded to I think you should have revealed the true Christ to

(7:29) her of and what okay tell me what the what the true reveal of the true Christ would have looked like from the true

(7:34) Christ is one who follows after Christ there are known by their fruits and more importantly they uh they're said they're

(7:40) in Christ's gibberish you haven't shown me how you would reveal that I would preach her the word and the gospel oh

(7:46) you were planning when she was trolling to pull out your Bible and start preaching the gospel I think that's a responsibility as any genuine Christian

(7:52) and you think that she would have like looked over and just kind of like mocked you cuz she would have I mean honestly if she does I don't care I think I think

(7:59) the important part is being faithful on a dating I just want to make sure I got this clear so on The Dating podcast your

(8:05) big plan was going to be that when a troll began to troll on The Dating podcast instead of you stopping the

(8:12) derailment through quickly humiliating the troll you would have pulled out your Bible and started preaching yeah and you

(8:18) think that that would have worked I think so okay all right well that criticism is addressed that's insane it

(8:24) would never work in a million and by the way Luke demonstrate it demonstrate yeah find me a troll and go pull your Bible

(8:30) out because they're troll I just want to make sure that you do understand they're trolling you know what do you know what a troll is I know what is a troll I

(8:36) think a troll is someone who intentionally comes on like you were saying to derail things they know what they're doing they're ironic they're being so if you pull out your Vibe

(8:43) aren't you feeding the troll yeah but I think I think you can say things and seeds will be swn that they can go back and they feel like they won the

(8:48) conversation but in reality the truth is still sewn okay so you would have fed the troll sure okay brilliant plan

(8:55) Luke okay want want to go to the next criticism sure so while we touched on the there were a

(9:02) couple things that you brought up immediately uh you said that we were perhaps this is directed more so towards

(9:08) me uh taking advantage uh what what does that mean precisely um so this is

(9:14) something I'm more passionate about but I think a lot of people in gen Z have kind of inherited a lot of a bill of false Goods as far as what love and what

(9:20) dating are and so on this podcast I think you guys do as I said before an excellent job of revealing just how

(9:26) broken I think the worldview is that's being presented of you know having to date around having have experience um people thinking that you know the double

(9:32) standards talking about oh you have to sleep around to understand if you can marry the person I think all of those things are bankrupt and I think there is

(9:37) a superior world view and um yeah I think I think most importantly the uh

(9:43) sorry can you read the question the taking advantage part yeah taking advantage part I think all of those people are bought into that lie and I

(9:50) think taking advantage of them for content and then clipping it to show how dumb they are without presenting the truth and teaching them I think it's you

(9:56) know it's doing half the job in not completing it I don't feel like argument out of you um so when you say taking

() 

(10:03) advantage in this context uh what exactly are you saying we're taking advantage of their lack of

(10:10) intellect going along with what the world says so you think they're stupid no I just think they're less educated then who I have no degree you guys are a

(10:17) little bit older you guys have been around no most of these women are my age really yeah a lot of the women who come

(10:23) on the show or my age yeah or only a couple years young do you think that like the 34y old who I get in an

(10:28) argument with is we going going to just suddenly become brilliant in 6 years no but I think you could show them the truth and maybe they would learn to

(10:34) listen to you they're going to learn to listen to okay uh have you seen that so when you say when you say taking advant

(10:40) yeah I have I've I've seen people willing to listen after you completely destroy their worldview they are totally humiliated have nothing left to appeal

(10:46) to then they tend to come around you yeah yeah uh so but when you say taking advantage would you agree with me that

(10:52) the whatever podcast is one of the largest IRL podcasts in the world I don't know the metrics but sure yeah

(10:58) okay would people have an incentive to come on to a podcast like that yeah for

(11:03) perhaps their own personal games and could those people come on here and just completely annihilate us

(11:10) destroy our worldview make us look stupid completely kick my ass into debate isn't that all available to them

(11:15) to do it's possible okay so if all those people can do that and they're coming on from the specific motivation of building

(11:21) their own brand and they end up getting annihilated in a debate even though all of my debates are out there they can

(11:26) research me inside and out they have every advantage never met them once who's taking advantage of who I would

(11:33) argue yeah they're probably not aware of what they're signing up for and you are doing what you feel like you can do in this podcast what evidence do you have

(11:39) that they don't know what they're signing up for I feel like sometimes people are just L by I feel I don't I don't need I feel what's your evidence

(11:46) not feelings it's social media right people are led by Fame people are led by the desire to be liked people are led by

(11:51) I would say largely um females as well too the lust of being looked at and being lusted how's that our responsibility not theirs well I think

(11:58) you guys can correct them yeah okay great but you said taking advantage my argument to you is no they're taking

(12:04) advantage of the program they want to get on and they have every opportunity that we do not have right because they

(12:10) don't have the social media presence a person can go research my debates for hours yeah right look for any log little

(12:17) inconsistency anything that they think could uh give them an Avenue for attack they could do all of that yeah I have

(12:23) the disadvantage I'm meeting with nine complete strangers every single week know nothing about them I don't get the

(12:28) name until an hour before these women come on literally okay I get the same

(12:34) information the audience gets the only way I get the names is if I read the thumbnail and I'm like who the hell are

(12:39) they I don't I don't know who any of them are yeah so I'm at a disadvantage okay they're at every Advantage who's

(12:45) taking advantage of who here Luke I would argue that you guys let them on in the first place why is that us taking advantage of them the Luke that's what

(12:51) you're not answering like them just coming on you have not demonstrated how that's us

(12:56) taking advantage of them and you've conceded that it sounds like they have tons of motivation to come on I don't

(13:03) understand how we're taking advantage of them how are they not taking advantage of this opportunity they're trying to take advantage to get attention oh so

(13:10) they're trying to take advantage of us yes on your platform got it so but I think so I just want to make sure when

(13:15) you say taking advantage I agree Brian you should not let these women take advantage of you like this and Luke

(13:21) agrees too 100% just conceited that they you shouldn't let them take advantage of you that's not fair Brian I personally

(13:27) believe that responsibility does come especially as a man with education I'm sorry there's men who come

(13:33) on the broadcast as well but I'm wondering why is it that we're infantilizing women and women do not in any way shape or form have the capacity

(13:40) to understand that they need to do a research to go on a show why do women not have the capacity to understand that

(13:47) um they could be uh entering into an arrangement uh do you think that women are just children who are infantilized

(13:52) and have no responsibility but like I said before I was talking about the idea the broken worldview that they're sold I think a lot of them being raised on

(13:59) social media not having both parents in the home are sold this false bill of goods and what about all these women who come on who have both parents in the

(14:05) home right they not only have both parents in the home but the parents go and they pat them on the head and say hey good job we glad you got gang bang

(14:11) last night and you're making a lot of money sweetie in I've never seen that oh it happens all the time interesting not

(14:17) only does it happen all the time but I call it out all the time and say what do your dad think and you know what they say Dad dad's really supportive do you

(14:22) think they're being honest sometimes okay yeah sometimes sometimes I think they're full of [ __ ] but how would I know how would I know unless I ask these

(14:30) kind of probing inquiring questions in order to draw the world viie out and that's going to risk offense right oh no absolutely I I I agree continue asking

(14:36) the probing questions but I think afterwards I think you should show them what the CH is to correct them instead of just breaking them down and from

(14:42) obviously I haven't watched all your guys podcasts and I know you guys have a lot more of a pulse on what dating looks like today versus than what I would but

(14:48) I think it's important to educate where it's like hey if you genuinely care about these people and yeah they might be coming with false motives take

(14:54) advantage of you but I I genuinely think Christ is you know he's the epitome of the logos yeah

(14:59) well I think that you're conflating two different ideas so you keep on saying okay uh you can show them the truth this

(15:05) and that this and okay fair fair that's all fair and we can get to that but right now we're still on this idea of

() 

(15:10) the taking advantage portion I still haven't seen you actually make a good case here for how anybody's getting

(15:16) taken advantage of except Brian Brian has the massive podcast Brian takes all the risk right and Brian's outnumbered 9

(15:23) to1 now if there was right now you were in that seat and there was nine different people right here debating

(15:28) with you you had to fight every second for speaking time would you feel like maybe perhaps you were wildly

(15:33) outnumbered maybe yeah yeah yeah maybe I mean are they all arguing that's me well that's me every week are they all

(15:39) arguing against me because I feel like you kind of come at them as well too like I feel like they're not coming on just toate yeah I'm an aggressive

(15:44) debater that's true but it doesn't matter it's you're kind of asking fory it's still 1 v9 right but I'm not

(15:50) complaining I mean some of the girls are on your side it wasn't one v9 wait they are are we taking advantage of them too

(15:56) no I don't think so well not them just we're only taking of the ones I disagree with I think the ones did you have

(16:02) social media growing up no I was born before the internet okay yeah and I was raised I don't even think the internet

(16:08) was really a thing till I was like late teens yeah like 95 or something yeah later on and the reason why I say that

(16:14) is because your home wasn't invaded by a lot of these false worldviews and ideas and even the temptation just to prostitute yourself out for validation

(16:21) and for money and so those ideas were there what's up those ideas were there they were just uh given to you in a

(16:27) different package they weren't hard to access there's plenty of plenty of women now it is true that the marketing aspect

(16:33) of it for this has become easier than ever with social media but these ideas the ideas themselves hisor even in the

(16:40) 9s there was just as much indoctrination going on feminist indoctrination all this type of stuff but Luke before I let

(16:46) you move on from this I really do need that demonstration of the taking

(16:51) advantage of them things I think that largely all these homes have been invaded by uh a toxic and i' ultimately

(16:57) say demonic ideology and confronting that is taking advantage of it I think not presenting them with the truth and

(17:03) letting them sit and just feel shame for buying into this ideology that we all agree is wrong you mean the thing that'll spur them to find the truth yeah

(17:10) oh but you don't present it so oh wait I'm sorry what Spurs them to find the truth you take showing them where

(17:15) they're wrong asking the questions so so you're saying that uh because I don't use this as a Pulpit for preaching I

(17:22) don't need to right that if I destroy an ideology it's completely in Ruins and wrecked and they're sitting there in

(17:27) shame what do you think that Spurs them to go do Luke I don't know find a different truth but who's to say they're

(17:33) they're going to find the right one there's only one right isn't that your belief yeah I believe so okay so uh from

(17:38) your view and my view Jesus Christ is the truth right source of all wisdom right okay and knock in what happens

(17:44) Luke knock and the door shall be open to you right knock and the door shall be

(17:50) open thing is it's like all you're saying to me is wait a second their ideology is completely destroyed and now

(17:55) they're going to start knocking on some doors right yeah okay and you don't feel like it's your responsibility to present that as a Christian do are you do you

(18:01) recognize that I follow up with many of these women after the show is n of they follow up with me no I didn't know that yeah do you do you are you aware also

(18:07) that there could be times and places where it's more appropriate to U push these views when these women can discuss

(18:13) them outside the of the realm of I was essayed by my dad I was essayed by my

(18:19) cousin uh these horrible things happened to me thanks for not bringing any of that stuff up right there's an more

(18:26) appropriate time perhaps to go after I think that's in the middle of a dating podcast right I really think that's

(18:32) honorable and I'm really happy that you guys do that that makes me uh really happy yeah but but before you knew any

(18:38) of that before you even asked about any of that you had a criticism Luke yeah I did isn't that interesting yep yeah well

(18:45) obviously I recogn Luke I don't know it sounds like you're here to get a little notoriety maybe Luke you're taking

(18:51) advantage of the whatever podcast right now possibly possibly okay willing to

(18:57) move on to the next point all right um do do you mind if I Circle back really quick goad do you feel like you have a

(19:02) platform right and you said you were talking about being the number one in the world no I'm not the number one number one dating podcast nope not the

(19:08) number one I'm saying that what was the metric I said it's one of the largest IRL dating podcasts in the world yes do

(19:14) you think the state of dating from your personal opinion is in a state of health or disarray oh it's it's a it's a [ __ ]

() 

(19:21) mess okay yeah do you feel any personal responsibility to show people the truth

(19:26) instead of just tearing down what's in disarray I do show them the truth okay but the thing is is that you do realize

(19:32) from a secular perspective that you can explain true statements of the metaphysical and of Jesus Christ even to

(19:39) a secularist through secular means that they can find this on their own yeah right you realize that yeah I do realize and that that's a not only a really good

(19:46) debate tactic but it's a really good way to not annoy people yeah right cuz you know what really pisses people off Bible

(19:53) Thumpers yeah people who when you're in the middle of an argument pull their Bible out and start well I don't know

(19:59) reading scripture to him which is what your great plan was right annoys him to death what doesn't annoy him I had

(20:05) friends come to Christ what doesn't annoy them is incremental change well yeah they're your friends they're in your Social Circle you can work on all

(20:11) day they weren't until they came to Christ and then I met them so you were just walking down the street and pulled out your Bible I was the one who read

(20:17) scripture to them that's how they came to Christ isn't that convenient isn't that convenient it wasn't you who read the scripture and they turned but

(20:22) somebody somewhere did here's how it really works people's World Views do not get smashed all at once MH it takes time

(20:29) incremental and the process for moving over is incremental too there could be and I'm not going to dispute this I'm

(20:34) sure that there are some people who some guy who's super intense and way more articulate and way smarter and way

(20:40) braver and all the adjectives you can think of than me has looked at a woman and been like stop prostituting come to

(20:45) Jesus and she was like okay I haven't seen it yeah I'm sure it's happened I haven't seen it I do see a methodology

(20:53) which does work though which is destroying a worldview and then building that worldview back into something else it's incremental takes many sessions But

(20:59) first you have to demonstrate the horrors of the behavior to begin with absolutely I think we both continue to agree on that point I think it's from

(21:06) that point going forwards I would largely say too even condemning people of saying like listen you're wrong

(21:11) you've done all these horrible things ultimately I think that's what actually qualify someone for the gospel they have to recognize that they're a sinner and I

(21:17) think in America we really struggle to take personal responsibility for our sin so I think this platform is a great opportunity what the hell is this

(21:23) criticism of taking advantage so not only are are you kind of conceding that they're taking

(21:29) the other direction more than we're taking advantage our take advantage but you let them on yeah why is that a

(21:34) problem to let them on I mean you can't be taken advantage of if you're willingly letting them on okay well then

(21:40) they can't be taken advantage of by that same logic by willingly what coming on okay thanks Luke sure I'll concede that

(21:47) point okay so there's quite a bit more to get through but the really uh one of

(21:53) the things you brought up was the uh substances you said in your message to us multiple times women asked to end the

(21:59) stream to return to their responsibilities and you instead shut them down and offered

(22:05) substances uh can you just clarify what substances were you believe were offered

() 

(22:11) so I may have been wrong I I believe it was maybe just alcohol and maybe caffeine but um from what my girlfriend

(22:18) said at the time the podcast hey give me a beer by the way good timing just in case you know substances yeah and I I

(22:26) will say normally I don't have an issue with substances the the only issue is that I believe the show was scheduled to end to the contestant not contestants

(22:33) Debaters at the time communicated about 10: p.m. it was getting late into the night around maybe 12:00 to 12:30 and

(22:39) some people had asked to go home including a mother and a woman who was going to do ministry on the sidewalk in front of Planned Parenthood the next

(22:44) morning very early and they were planning on being done at 10: p.m. and when they had asked multiple times to leave they were instead offered alcohol

(22:51) and caffeine to keep them going and then they the conversation kept going there was twitch readouts and I felt like that

(22:56) was kind of taking advantage of people's schedule what you had communicated I'm actually enjoying the framing here so

(23:01) let me I won't I won't say maybe taking advantage let me let me read the framing here to you okay so what you would call

(23:09) uh it you you took advantage by offering um by offering substances if we say take

(23:15) advantage it's we're going to get okay you offered them substances right and and this was uned you're actually from

(23:21) what I hear is you were looking after your guest's needs so your guest if your guest was hungry gave him food they

(23:27) wanted to drink you gave a drink they wanted alcohol at 21 years old you can give them an now I don't know about you

(23:32) Luke but if if I have a podcast and I have somebody over on a podcast you know what I also what I do a lot I go hey man

(23:39) this is going a little longer you want a beer yeah and you know what they usually say you'll never guess it they say yes

(23:45) they say yeah sure man I'd love to have a beer so this this is all framing right

(23:51) you're just framing this well in this specific instance that I watched the person who was offered the alcohol did

(23:57) not ask for Al alcohol and more importantly they had asked on the opposite side along with two other people who what does that mean asked on

(24:03) the opposite side they had asked to leave okay you don't ask to leave why do you ask to leave I don't know maybe

(24:09) because you want to follow the rules of the show you're on like Luke are are you being held hostage here no I could leave

(24:16) are there men behind you with ues who are threatening that if you get up off that chair and walk out the door that

(24:21) you will be put down or can you just get up right this second and walk out and nobody would do a [ __ ] thing maybe

(24:27) they wanted to follow the rules so you guys I don't know I I hang on just to

(24:33) get this right they're following rules that you don't know inside of some type of contract you don't understand and

(24:40) your criticism is that their needs were being met by whatever they wanted to

(24:45) clarify I believe my criticism was that beyond what it had been communicated before for the sake of what appears to

(24:51) be financial gain and just clipping people I think they were offered substances as an incentive to stay on

(24:57) after asked to yeah just like I would offer my friend a beer and say hey we're going a little long on the show would

(25:03) you like a beer yeah but I think there's a difference too with people that have responsibilities and they want to go home yeah but why would that be a

(25:08) criticism towards the show like why that would be like criticis criticizing me if

(25:14) I had a person on my show and said we're going a little this actually just happened to me I was on a show with

(25:21) Elijah schaer oh yeah okay and he was like Hey man uh I know that we're going

(25:26) a little bit longer and he had to leave right you know would you like a drink we

(25:31) just kind of barrel through the rest of this now I took advantage of my gracious host yeah offering to me this drink it

(25:39) was very kind of him to do you know what I didn't do I didn't go later and go oh

(25:45) guys I couldn't believe you know we went over and this son of a [ __ ] offered me a drink this bastard ah we got to we got

(25:52) to get him guy doesn't that sound absurd to you it could I think did you ask to leave first though yeah well fact

(25:58) emphatically I said listen I have a hard out I have a hard out cuz I had another podcast I had to get to so I was like

(26:05) dude I have a hard out we went over the time anyway [ __ ] happens right hey man

(26:11) can you can you stay can you stay I know we're a little over can you stay and how about a drink yeah boy this is real

(26:18) nefarious stuff Luke this is uh this is some real bad knife twisting stuff you

(26:23) got going here yeah I think the context is different um why because it's females versus males oh because we're back to

(26:29) infantilizing women again no I think women can't assert themselves they were being held hostage they had no choice

(26:35) they had to be here they have no autonomy and if Luke was here you would have made sure right you would have walked them right out the door if they

(26:41) would have asked to leave after the time that we communicated that they would be done I would let them out might I jump in briefly on a couple things I I will

(26:48) try to at least for the remainder of the debate be fairly uh unbiased here but I

(26:54) do at least want to clarify just a couple things so I pulled up the messages that we have with car and I I said the and this is what's

() 

(27:01) communicated to almost all the guests who come on SO me time 4 p.m. we wrap

(27:06) around wrap around 10 but may go later though okay uh and sometimes the

(27:12) communication depending on the person it's communicated a little differently yeah we will typically say wrap around

(27:18) 10 or 11 but we may go later though in addition to that people who typically

(27:24) have days weeks or even months to do even a mod modom of research uh can look

(27:29) for themselves and see the length of the individual podcast they can see that it's 6 7 8 hours at times they can sort

(27:37) of do a uh assessment there okay if we're going to meet at 4 P.M then that means that and we go live at 5:00 p.m.

(27:43) that means I should anticipate the show ending anywhere from 10:1 or 12:00 p.m. I believe we wrapped around sometime

(27:49) between 12:00 and 12:30 that night closer to one yeah well do you know what time that is in my time it's pretty late

(27:56) yeah it's almost yeah usually I get done 5: a.m. were they taking advantage of you keeping you up no certainly not and

(28:03) just lastly here and by the way if I wanted to you know what I could do it's amazing you know what I could do if I was like hey Brian you know what I got a

(28:09) heart out and he said no I could just go okay just walk and leave and there's

(28:16) nothing anybody on planet Earth could do about that because you're a co-host of the show no I'm not a co-host I'm guest

(28:22) you're a guest mhm you're a frequent guest frequent who has a good relationship with the host yeah but

(28:27) there's other females who are here who are frequent guests who also have a great relationship with the host there's other men who have a great relationship

(28:33) with the host there's Jake rattlesnake Mason by the way who's laid up in a hospital right now great relationship

(28:38) with Brian yeah many many of these people have a great relationship with Brian this kind of absurd idea that

(28:44) there was like some sort of Hostage taking going on is um that's all rhetoric designed around framing you you

(28:51) can even take something as non- nefarious as offering your guest refreshment and somehow turn that into

(28:58) an assault on the guest and you can see from my end how I think that that's so absurd and that you're framing it up to

(29:05) make somebody an evil do or nefarious character who had no nefarious intentions at all except to finish out

(29:10) the show strong and make sure the guest needs were attended to yeah I I apologize I may have misread your guys'

(29:15) intentions but from an outside perspective it just looked like people were trying to leave after the time that had been communicated and instead you

(29:21) guys were incentivizing to them to stay for content and for personal gain if I wasn't reading that wait wait wait wait

(29:27) if you have people who agree to be a guest on your show okay you're doing the show you go over time what in the world

(29:34) would ever in a million years be wrong with offering them incentives to stay I was just refusing their request to leave

(29:41) you don't you can't refuse a request to leave it's not it's not a thing which can be done like how would I refuse your

(29:47) request to leave say no no Luke you can't leave and then what happens you

(29:53) get up and leave right I don't I don't really like I'm really lost on this Luke I'm not going to lie

(30:00) I'm starting to get lost as well too but the main point I was getting after was just the time of communication staying

(30:05) up late being up till around 12:30 on a night when most people are working and then when asking to leave just offering

(30:11) was this a Tuesday or a Sunday it was a Tuesday it was Tuesday night I believe it was a Tuesday show final thing on this and then I'll just let you guys

(30:17) back to get back to it uh the the substances component here um that is also a bit of framing you know by

(30:25) referring it to as sub substance instead of so Pizza wouldn't that be a substance

(30:32) it could be yeah here some trans fat uh you

(30:38) monsters I do want I and perhap I I don't know if it's even worth pulling it up but I I did do a cursory bear in mind

(30:46) these episodes are 7 hours long I briefly went over the transcript uh you said that alcohol was offered I actually

() 

(30:54) looked it over and I believe it was actually I don't know if it was me making the offer or if it was

(31:00) specifically Nicolet requesting for alcohol so I'm not I could be I don't

(31:05) want to say definitively because I went back and looked I'm pretty sure what

(31:11) happened is Nicollet was we were talking about how she was a party girl mhm right

(31:16) she wanted some booze yeah monster you [ __ ] monster you you

(31:22) were willing to you were willing to Grant this grown not infant woman's request to have that now Luke to be fair

(31:30) when you came here I was also a monster I did offer you a beer is that correct

(31:35) yes did you think that that was nefarious no I don't think it was nefarious I do think it it does help people open up more and you know helps

(31:41) conversation go well and also do people get their nerves racked right mhm and do you think like having one alcoholic

(31:48) beverage can assist with that absolutely and do you think that a person could request that because they want that yeah

(31:55) where's the monster Behavior here can't you guys as a monster I just want to go back to the point here and like I said

(32:01) maybe I re maybe iwatched the transcript and maybe this is a un completely invalid criticism but from what I had

(32:07) seen I had seen two women and one who was a mother and the one who was about to do ministry in the morning request to leave after the time that was

(32:12) communicated going into on a week night to leave and then a third request I believe from Nicollet saying she was

(32:18) tired and she wanted to go home before being offered I can't believe how irresponsible these women are a a mother

() 

(32:25) irresponsibly decided to go on a podcast C on a week night along with a woman who had another engagement in the morning

(32:31) thinking they could fit all of that through these are irresponsible people Luke did you send any of them a DM

(32:38) telling them that it was irresponsible of them when they have children at home to and that they they may have to run

(32:45) back to to go on a podcast on a work night did you tell any of these women

(32:50) how irresponsible they were no of [ __ ] course not just Brian just Brian's fault right because the poor

(32:56) women they just the if they they little angel they're angels and Brian's exploiting them for his own personal

(33:03) game not a single message right Luke nothing just Brian yeah okay couple couple other

() 

(33:10) things here on the substances component uh again definitively I didn't look at the entire transcript I do believe it

(33:16) was Nicollet who she requested the alcohol I don't think I made any uh

(33:21) offerings specifically of alcohol in an effort to get guests to say I do believe I offered energy drinks because but it

(33:30) was more so some of the guests like you said Nicollet stated that she was tired some of the other guests stated that

(33:35) they were tired and so they perhaps wanted to leave because they were tired I felt it was appropriate to offer an

(33:42) energy drink to alleviate the tiredness uh so in terms of offering

(33:49) substances I believe it was a Red Bull perhaps a Monster Energy don't recall the exact uh but I did I I I I did offer

(33:59) energy drinks substances caffeine yeah I don't think the substances was as evil

(34:06) like I said maybe I was wrong in interpreting you guys were just trying to care for them but I feel like as hosts if someone does ask to leave the

(34:12) most caring thing to do is to oblige I think the most caring thing for a responsible mother to do would be to not

(34:17) come on a podcast like that if she had other engagements with her kids if she was communicated that it would end at 10 she would probably be like okay I oh so

(34:23) they get a pass so so wait so they had an expectation that expectation didn't work out they get a pass he has an

(34:29) expectation that expectation doesn't work out [ __ ] him what was his expectation the expectation was that you stay for the show duration it could go

(34:35) past X time very very fairly communicated you just read the communication could go past this time

(34:40) yeah what's the expectation here Luke Fair Point final thing on the

(34:46) substance thing I do just want to offer this up as clarification we actually make it a uh sort of a rule that we

(34:53) actually don't want to offer people any alcohol uhuh before the show we we don't

(34:59) want any sort of uh wck I've gotten my ass chewed so there was a time it was the last time I was down here in person

(35:06) I was around with the girls and there was this a chick I'd been on the the program with before and I always bring

(35:12) my beer in here cuz I'm not going to [ __ ] do what Brian says right but but um but she was you know she was sitting

(35:19) there and I was like hey you want a beer she said sure yeah right so I gave her a beer and Brian was like no with the the

(35:25) pre-show like no he chewed my ass for it never did it again right chewed my ass

(35:30) but we uh yeah we do tend to make it a habit of uh other shows we sometimes

(35:36) offer alcohol but it's sort of uh there there could be some perception of

(35:43) impropriety for example someone might make a uh allegation that we are

(35:49) attempting to liquor up the guests prior to the show in an effort to get them to say things they wouldn't otherwise say

(35:55) you mean a guy like Luke I I to be fair I didn't say prior to the show no sure I just wanted to clarify

(36:01) that for any of the viewers we actually pretty hard and fast roll we don't offer any alcohol to the guest prior to the

(36:07) show the only instance where we do EX for me what's that except for me well I offered it well and the thing is he's

(36:13) not the host so the thing is is like there's a lot of wisdom in it right and once it was explained to me why was like

(36:20) okay you know cuz I saw it as harmless yeah right I that's that's how I do things I I'm in the midwest when you

(36:26) come to my house there's three things that are going to happen cigar the first thing that's going to happen is you're going to get fed and I have no say in

(36:32) that okay my wife's going to feed you no matter what it doesn't even matter if you came right from a restaurant you're getting fed yeah period doesn't matter

(36:40) the second thing is I'm going to offer you a drink right and then the third thing is probably a little bit of gun

(36:45) shooting right those are like the big three but at least the the fed and Al like that's just a given that's how

(36:51) everybody does things so I see it as harmless right someone's like hey that looks great it was a hot day you know

(36:57) like sure you want a beer I didn't think of it didn't think anything of it but there was a lot of wisdom what Brian

(37:03) said right it it's essentially a bit of a liability for us to even uh to to

(37:09) offer people alcohol because again they could make some sort of claims that they came on the show they got they tried to

(37:16) get us drunk so that we could say so just sort of across theboard rule we don't offer alcohol the only time is

(37:22) occasionally people will do a donation tier for a champagne pop in which case they'll have

(37:28) about they'll get poured about three sips worth of uh champagne so aside from

(37:33) I think actually on the your girlfriend was on there was a champagne donated $100 hey thank you this gentleman turn

(37:40) used Loosely definitely has a humiliation fetish what the he's seen the skill level of Andrew and knew full

(37:46) well he was going to be the underdog I bet he's at half mast under that table all right cias appreciate it I

(37:54) we'll really quick pull up was a good roast we'll pull up a super chat here from pelagic to pelagic says this guy's

(39:08) been posting behind the scenes uh we've been doing some IRL streams by the way guys uh we posted this clip uh we were

(39:15) out with Jake rattlesnake it was last weekend this this guy he's like the

(39:20) stream sniper it's the third time we were out yesterday he he's insane we

(39:26) posted the BTS of it we post some kickouts so be sure to check it out discord.gg whatever and then really

(39:31) quick I'll just sense it's relevant but it's below the threshold uh we had uh this woman pink pill on uh was it the

(39:39) Tuesday show Austin I think it was don't offer yeah we don't um we make it a rule

(39:44) not to offer alcohol we don't want any uh even appearances of impropriety so um

(39:50) just wanted to clarify that on the whole substance in front uh let's get into the rest of the I guess some of the

(39:56) criticism here um Austin are you able to pull up the window tab so we can actually see what

(40:03) was written just okay so uh I copi and pasted the

(40:09) Instagram messages into a notepad here so uh can we start with please be respectful of the women you have on in

(40:16) the future that make them want to come back really quick before actually I I think uh there was some conversations

(40:22) about Andrew being a frequent frequent guest uh nicholet is actually also she's

(40:27) been on the show I think five six times I just wanted to point that out so uh

(40:33) she's and also very good sport yeah yeah yeah have you seen change no not at all

(40:39) okay are you you still following up with messaging uh I don't think I've received a message for that cuz you you were

(40:45) talking about presenting people after shattering their worldview on camera well usually they contact me oh okay mhm

() 

(40:51) you Andrew you wanted to get into the please be respectful of the women you have on in the future yeah okay listen

(40:56) so here's here's my take on this right uh this criticism usually comes from people who don't watch the long form of

(41:03) the show they watch the clips yeah so when they see the clip they see a heated exchange but they have no context for

(41:09) the exchange mhm so I'm just going to be blunt and ask you yeah is this idea

(41:14) coming from the clips or is it coming from you actually having watched several long form whatever podcast episodes I

(41:21) have seen one or two full 7 hour all 14 hour of your guys content yeah so then I

(41:27) don't understand the criticism because you should know then that almost always the conversations are very kind of

(41:34) mundane and talk about kind of mundane things they only get heated if we kind of brush up against political topics or

(41:40) when ideologies begin to converge right that's not only expected but I I don't

(41:47) even understand why you would have a problem with that you know for sure that that's the most divisive thing on planet

(41:53) Earth you're carrying around with you oh yeah so so what the hell is this criticism ISM the criticism can you

(42:00) repeat the question one more time yeah it's be respectful to the women's because you're going to hurt their feeling they won't come back to the show

(42:05) yeah the criticism was specifically directed to people who had opened up about being bullied before and receiving

(42:11) a lot of harassment from their character and then doubling down on that after you had already shattered their worldview

(42:17) and like I said not presenting them with the truth and I ultimately feel like that's more condemning have you ever heard the term

(42:22) crybully say it again have you ever heard the term crybully no so crybully is somebody who uh they come on they

() 

(42:30) they do the bullying M but then when you hit back they cry about it hurt people hurt people right oh you're this you're

(42:38) that you're this you hit them back with one thing and suddenly oh I can't believe you said that to me

(42:45) right if you've watched these long form episodes you'll note that most of the time uh I just match energy yep so if

(42:52) you're like if you're pretty chill you're pretty laidback uh I'm pretty chill and laidback right if uh if you're

(42:59) kind of loud and obnoxious I'll be loud and obnoxious if you do if you want to move into personal attacks I move right

(43:05) into the personal attacks right the but what that actually does is it de-escalates a situation so generally

(43:11) when a person knows it's just like the idea of the person who thinks they can punch you yeah if you if they know

(43:17) you'll punch back they're less likely to punch you right it's the same exact mentality there yeah right so the idea

(43:23) is not to escalate to deescalate and the best way to do that is is when somebody

(43:28) is giving you a certain type of energy if you kind of give it right back to them they tend to kind of chill out a

(43:34) little more like ah you're not the guy who I want to do this with yeah you're pushing back turning yeah right do you

(43:39) actually see anything wrong with that I understand it um I think I would from a more biblical standpoint uh I've looked

(43:45) a little bit into eastn Orthodoxy nice eyebrow um theosis process of you know

(43:51) becoming like Christ right I don't think I see that behavior in Christ you mean pit of vipers right you're going to

(43:56) you're going to go to hell you're going to go to hellers those people were prideful and they would not recognize their sin oh and I think you I think you

(44:03) were in a situation really they were prideful wouldn't recognize her sin push back against Jesus said he was a false

(44:09) Messiah ended up putting him on a cross killing him those guys yeah I'm thinking that in the situation of the adulterous

(44:15) woman Christ actually said I do not condemn you he said go and sin no more yeah John 8 go and sin no more now did

(44:21) she fight him was she arguing with Christ before he was talking about she wasn't arguing with him she never argued

(44:27) with Christ did she go you're not the Son of God uhuh nuh I am queen I am

(44:33) Queen of the Desert I am queen of this desert you are not the son of did she do

(44:38) any of that or did she agree with him and then he told her to go sit in no more go s no more so have you ever heard

(44:44) a woman go Andrew I agree with you I should stop being a prostitute and I was like no no that's not good enough you

(44:51) must you must be pun has that ever happened I haven't watched all your episodes but I would I would say that

(44:56) sometimes you could have the discernment to see someone who is projecting and who is a hurt person that is hurting other

(45:01) people and you could meet them with compassion and say listen I'm actually not going to engage and go tit fortat

(45:07) with the name call and with all these things and you've actually exposed one of the reasons why you're probably doing this because of a prior wound from

(45:13) someone else and then you go ahead you mean them they're they're exposing from a w they're exposing the wound yeah

(45:19) that's all pseudo psychological nonsense right it could just be because they're a [ __ ] did you ever think of that like it

(45:25) could just be that the make of this woman there is no prior wound there is no prior thing that happened there is no

() 

(45:31) real crutch for them to lean on they're just kind of a rotten [ __ ] no like has that ever even occurred to you that

(45:37) there's a possibility that some women are so entitled and have their asses kissed all day long that just hearing a

(45:44) tiny bit of push back triggers them and makes him completely irrational uh turning turning him into

(45:51) like nonsense babbling lunatics like is that possible too I think Christ died to

(45:56) save sinners of whom I am chief and I don't want to judge others knock them down and I you just you're judging me

(46:02) I'm not trying to judge you how are you not judging me you just you're making all sorts of value assessments and value judgments based on preconceived notions

(46:10) and you don't even have in many of these cases the correct information how is it okay though I think the only reason you

(46:16) feel like it's okay to assess and judge me is because you think he can take

(46:22) it I'm not trying to judge you I'm trying to show what I believe the truth to be and the correct way to go about

(46:27) the behavior go and sin no more yeah what does that mean telling them to stop and forsake their sin yeah so do they

(46:34) have to acknowledge that I think so if they're arguing with you are they acknowledging that maybe if they're

(46:39) arguing with you they're acknowledging that they might be you can't tell what

(46:44) well if I couldn't tell then how could I make that assessment if you can't tell you have to

(46:51) make the assessment I think regardless of what they're saying back to you your message always still has to be compassion in repentance even if they're

(46:58) pushing back yeah but telling the truth uhhuh is going to to to a person who

() 

(47:03) believes the things that these people believe yeah it's going to be mean from their perspective it's going to be cruel it's going to be awful it's going to be

(47:09) horrible you're going to be a monster how can I assess if a woman is still arguing with me that she's she's coming

(47:16) to the message that makes no sense dude how could how you tell me how could I assess that ever maybe the fact that

(47:22) they're revealing their uh prior wounds like I was saying before when they say they're proud of them

(47:28) I mean do you really think they are sometimes yeah for sure I would probably disagree there but yeah I know but you

(47:33) wouldn't base it on anything you would have nothing to base it on you would how can I make an assessment on what a

(47:40) person what's in their heart other than what comes out of their mouth yeah and I I apologize I might be projecting here

(47:46) but I will just say from a personal experience especially with talking with people that do want to push back and argue I usually come from the

(47:51) perspective of this person I need to share Jesus Christ with this person not only his judgment and his conviction of sin but more importantly repentance and

(47:58) the kindness of God that leads us to repentance and I think that's an element that I always want to infuse even if they are pushing back but there's a time

(48:05) for placement of that as well and that's discernment yes is knowing the time to

(48:10) place this uh but this really avoids my question M how can you make a value

(48:16) judgment or a value assessment on somebody's arguing against your position

(48:21) and think oh they get it how could you ever do that I don't think you can you can't do it right so then don't

(48:27) understand the criticism of saying but Andrew you you have special discernment

(48:32) that nobody else on planet Earth has that I'm aware of where you can discern based

(48:37) on I don't know some like ESP or something like this what's actually in their heart how could I ever do that

(48:44) this is where I would probably say it would be the Holy Spirit yeah okay you couldn't do that you couldn't

(48:52) make that value assessment ever you just admitted that you could do strength yeah

(48:58) you well but when you say the Holy Spirit you could think something's the Holy Spirit and it's not you still have

(49:04) to gauge and judge things with when when you say discernment that's what we're

(49:09) talking about here right if if everything that's coming out of your mouth is counter to what I'm saying to

(49:16) you or to the argument that I'm giving to you yeah there is literally no reason you could ever give me why I should

(49:23) think oh they get it yeah how how how could you ever know that but I think you could still be led to say things that

(49:29) wouldn't make sense in the time based off of your own judgment from God yeah through the argument though it's still

(49:35) going to be placed in the argument right like where else is where else put you could divert and just talk directly to

(49:41) them talk to their heart instead of just the words they're saying yeah you can make emotional appeals that's true they

(49:46) don't last long and they're very poor because you know what happens somebody else makes a counter emotional appeal

(49:52) yeah St was arguing with a woman the other night on Twitter this woman was stupid right but she said her entire

(49:59) argument was but abortionists have been able to convince me multiple times on the sa thing because it tugs on my

(50:07) heartstrings this means that what she's actually saying is people have made great logical arguments to me and I

(50:13) agree with them but once that emotional appeal is made I still want to lean

(50:18) towards it right yeah so you have to get in that worldview now I can't make great emotional appeals because I'm not really

(50:24) an emotional guy right it's not my thing but I can great make great logical appeals and I can make great logical

(50:30) arguments that's the best way I know how to interact yeah then maybe we just disagree or we agree to disagree and we

(50:38) have different styles and how we would show someone the truth and how we would try and counter them and point them to Christ I I I can't really kind of get

(50:45) let you get away with this though because because of this yeah because you said and I'm going to I'm going to try

(50:50) to quote here quot me you said that the best way well I can't

(50:56) quote you I'm sorry I didn't write it down I wrote something else down but the best way I want to make sure that I don't straw man this position so I'll

(51:02) just ask you again if you're in an argument you with somebody else yeah and

(51:10) they say to you I disagree with everything you're saying right now and you're completely wron mhm how could I

(51:16) ever make the value judgment that they think anything other than that you can't

(51:22) I can't yeah short of the holy spirit's inspiration yeah well I mean I guess but even that would be very hard to detect

(51:30) right even that would be like I think that that's an appeal that that you're making an appeal that a standard appeal

(51:37) that you would never have towards anything else right be like in that case the Holy Spirit should have filled you

(51:42) up Andrew and it's like what does that look like yeah right I it would look like being given the words to say

(51:48) boldness confidence but but I can easily make all of those kind of right appeals right but

(51:55) I'm just not arrogant enough to think it's because the holy spirit is necessarily directing me right like I'm

(52:03) just not going to be arrogant enough to State God's speaking through me right now I'm just not going to be arrogant enough to do that yeah I mean you don't

(52:09) have to say God is speaking through me directly yeah but I mean so when you when you make that appeal it's just it's

(52:15) just to me it's just kind of a nonsense appeal right yes the holy spirit moves through people I've seen it myself I

(52:20) know for sure that that happens right I have no idea how you would place that in

(52:26) an argument though and say other than what's coming out of your mouth this is what I hear this is what I see how else

(52:34) I make the value judgment at least in a way that's rational and reasonable yeah in 1 Corinthians I believe 14 it talks

(52:40) about a word of knowledge or a Word of Wisdom a gift of discernment um and I think that might just be something that we see differently of being able to see

(52:47) someone and see the words they're saying and see a different approach or their heart posture behind it but that's like

(52:52) I said that's where I'm coming from in this okay we can move that one on I don't know where else to go with it

(52:58) sure Austin can you pull back up the uh the

(53:05) notes all right so we addressed the please be respectful of the women uh

(53:11) second your treatment of Nicollet was inexcusable she is clearly broken that

(53:17) was the whole point of the stream right show how logical and dumb she is is this something that n well we'll let this

(53:23) living under cor donated $100 question for the [ __ ] on white night

(53:28) during an apocalypse uh nice thank you living you somehow got

(53:35) around the uh you got around the uh filter there

() 

(53:41) but I appreciate the message uh why we go ahead pull it back up did you uh want to uh please be respectful of the women

(53:49) I want to make sure um I I just want to make sure I get the right people here right I I talked to a lot of people was

(53:56) Nichol that the one I said had a gunt I don't think so I don't remember that word was that was that the one that that

(54:01) was the one okay and I disavow the G gunt of course I disavow the gun comment

(54:07) but I wanted to make I think that that creates a reference for the whatever audience they know what's being

(54:12) referenced yeah that's all okay yeah okay yeah so anyway that it was that

(54:19) girl yeah the horrible troll I don't remember seeing I don't remember hearing that word but sure oh maybe I should

(54:26) have just not even brought that up then yeah it's more ammo to my side uh do you

(54:31) do you want to can yeah yeah can you pull the criticism back up R um so uh

(54:37) the treatment of nickolet was inexcusable she's clearly broken uh it's not clear so when you say so these are

(54:44) like loaded terms you're using kind of loaded terms here when you say things like it's very clear X is true yeah it's

(54:50) not clear X is true when you say it's obvious it's not obvious right I would

(54:56) take so I'm going to take issue first with the idea of what is clear what is obvious yeah it is not always obvious to

(55:02) me in fact it's almost never obvious to me uh what's going through a person's brain until they verbalize everything

(55:10) that's going through their brain why they think the things they do people have such a wide array of motivations

(55:16) some people could be on the troll for the or or the show for the purposes of trolling or derailment some people could be on the show for the purpose of

(55:22) pushing their own agenda some may be here for just really good faith dialogue I like all of it right for me all of

(55:29) it's fun the whole Gambit if you're a troll on Tuesday I like dealing I like dealing with that sometimes I like

(55:34) dealing with the great faith Combos and I like dealing with the heated arguments I like the full kind of spectrum of that

(55:40) yeah but when you when you use loaded language like this when you say it's should be clear or X is is obvious that

(55:48) to me is again just framing you're just saying you should have known better than x and so Now's the Time where you get to

(55:54) demonstrate Now's the Time where I get to listen and you get to demonstrate how that was clear that treatment of

(56:01) Nicollet was inexcusable and how it was clear that she's clearly broken I would say it comes to the point

(56:07) where the person has talked about their wounds earlier on the reasons why they were AB bullied or harassed or they were

(56:13) made fun of and then you lead them to the point where they're literally saying yeah I think I'm siding with the devil instead of God for doing only fans you

(56:20) broke them to that point where they really that not the same chick nicholet did not say that nichette

(56:26) said that you guys you guys I what did sorry could you just repeat what she said I can look

(56:31) up question her because she had claimed to be a Christian yeah yeah that was a different chick though I'm pretty sure that that's not Nicollet I don't think

(56:37) Nicollet would honestly like maybe I'm wrong but I don't think that Nicollet

(56:43) would say if if you asked her what would God prefer that you do this versus that

(56:49) I don't think that she would take the Gambit on that the one that I the one that I called that what did she say we

(56:54) can look it up specifically you guys were asking her I believe Andrew was he was asking a very probing question if

(57:00) you guys were following up like all right you believe in God why are you still doing only fans and it came to a head where you say okay who do you think

(57:07) who do you think wants you to do only fans God or the devil and she said yeah well probably the devil that was Nicollet though or was

(57:13) that another girl on the panel I think that that was the other girl I I think it was the girl who was sitting

(57:19) there I mean we're going to have to just shoot in the dark at this point we got transcripts look the redheaded woman who

(57:27) was dating the one next to her like the quiet girl I think she was kind of

(57:34) quiet you'll have to give me a few moments to look this up but um I'm not

(57:39) sure yeah I'm not actually sure that that's the right girl well so the one on that P nette was just kind of

(57:45) like a trolling brat but I'm not sure that she would so I mean on that panel the only two women who were involved

(57:51) with the only fans were Nicollet and then the redheaded woman who claimed she dated Tristan Tate was it Nicollet yeah

(57:58) mean it was most likely I think it was most likely Nicollet really okay this was the Satan

(58:06) God question yeah I can look up the transcript I'm pretty sure you posed it to her though was it if you want

(58:12) definitive I can look up the transcripts but I do think you might have posed it to her yeah I don't I mean I don't remember but um but go ahead with the

(58:19) criticism the point being said I think we both agree do you think it's a positive or A negative for a woman to be doing only fans

() 

(58:26) yeah Okay negative right yeah do you think positive or negative large scale for Our Generation yeah it's negative

(58:33) negative okay so she's clearly shown youve you've gapped her logic and she's showing the fact of where she's coming

(58:38) from with a place of hurt and I think it's that it's a last part place of hurt

(58:43) yeah that's do you think people go into only fans just being super confident and self-secure and then they they're okay

(58:49) yeah I think that people will I think I have never ever endorsed nor

(58:56) bought into this kind of stupid idea that people themselves mhm are not

(59:03) capable themselves of evil or themselves of adjudicating what they think evil is

(59:08) for their own personal motivations while I think that the devil leads the world

(59:13) astray I have never taken the responsibility off of the human being themselves for engaging in evil Behavior

(59:20) yeah and so when you say the idea of well it's broken well that's not clear

(59:26) or there's past trauma well that's not clear what's what the only thing that's clear is I've made the decision to do

(59:33) that what you're doing there is creating an inference that actually removes the gap of responsibility by giving them

(59:39) something else that they can point to other than them for this is why I do what I do yeah why do you think that

(59:47) that's appropriate I I don't think I want to absolve them of responsibility I think responsibility is actually the highest form of agency and that that is

(59:53) the one thing you do bring to the scandal of the Gospel and the fact that there's only one thing you bring to the cross and that's your own sin the person

(59:59) has to take responsibility for it and I think you were at a prime example of showing her the gospel and showing her

(1:00:05) Christ and instead that was not made and you instead that was not the point to beat her over the head of the Bible that

(1:00:10) was not the right point to do that you you just agreed that you it's better for her not to be doing only fans yeah do

(1:00:15) you think there's a better way to remove someone from but listen to from her view at that time right it wouldn't matter

(1:00:21) what woman you were talking to at this point unless you can provide credible evidence of what this hurt or you know

(1:00:28) thing that must have happened that led you to do X right I just don't have the same faith in in I guess in these women

(1:00:34) that you do where you think that they're just kind of like born Angelic or something I don't know um they're not

(1:00:40) they have all sorts of their own motivations all sorts of reasons they want to do things totally external to

(1:00:46) the kind of motivations I think you think they all have I just think it's good oldfashioned American Greed they

(1:00:52) want money and this is a really easy way to get it and they don't give it damn yeah couldn't that just be the simple

(1:00:58) explanation it could be a simple explanation so if that is the case and let's assume she said it because I

(1:01:03) usually do make them say it right I usually do get to the heart of the motivation yeah assuming for a second

(1:01:08) that she did uh that's what I have to go on that would not have been the key place to insert gospel it would have

(1:01:16) been the key place then to continue down the Avenue logically of do you think it's okay to be a selfish person and why

(1:01:22) yeah have you look at yourself in the mirror and go oh [ __ ] maybe maybe being a self-centered nihilistic piece of [ __ ]

(1:01:28) who does this horrible thing to myself in society isn't very good that might be the good time to interject a different

(1:01:35) worldview right but again that's also kind of up to the person in the argument

(1:01:40) when to insert these things yeah not up to you the viewer yeah you're absolutely right so how does this like I don't even

(1:01:47) understand where this criticism come from following down I saw instead [ __ ] shaming good what's wrong with that

(1:01:54) you've already shown that they're broken and I I think you don't need to condemn them anymore me showing you a thing is

(1:02:02) different than you accepting the thing okay you saying you already showed her

(1:02:09) this Gap in the logic you get to have this great Primo seat the whole audience

(1:02:14) right now right all of you looking at the camera all that whole audience gets this Primo front row seat mhm right

(1:02:22) they're sitting down on the couch they've got their popcorn right or whatever they're eating right I hope you guys are you know having something

(1:02:28) delicious right now they're having a beer they're enjoying themselves they have the Primo front row seat where they can be like okay from the bird's eye

() 

(1:02:35) view here's what I think is going on yeah you the person who is the interlocutor the engager right you have

(1:02:43) a different perspective than the external viewer you would agree that that's true right yeah so from the

(1:02:49) perspective of the internal viewer the idea here is no you're are not actually

(1:02:54) taking responsibility no you're still fighting against this yes you may have accepted that what I've said is true

(1:03:01) right but you have not admitted yet that it is true so you know kind of the

(1:03:07) placement of where you're going to insert ideology to that's a much harder

(1:03:12) thing to gauge right much harder thing to gauge yeah I I agree I think where

(1:03:19) you go with the ideology and where ultimately you do present the gospel depends on the person it depends on the situation it has to but I would say I

(1:03:25) don't think shaming has any part of a gospel presentation why not what's wrong with [ __ ] shaming Jesus

(1:03:31) says that we will be held accountable to every word that we speak and that by our words will be justified and by our words

(1:03:37) will be condemned and and as he says with the plank in your eye you be judged by the same standard for which you judge

(1:03:42) others so that means that I should be willing to accept being [ __ ] shamed yes I think shame is is where I

(1:03:50) draw the line why that's not wait a second now you're conflating two different ideas is do you agree that the

(1:03:57) standard from which you judge is a standard for which you will be judged according to Matthew yeah okay you agree

(1:04:03) with this yes okay so am I judging by a hand standard that I am refusing myself

(1:04:09) to be judged by you're judging a hand am am I judging by a standard that I refuse

(1:04:15) to be judged by I'm have to think about that one for a second

(1:04:27) no no okay ready to move on when you are Oh I thought the whole is [ __ ]

(1:04:34) shaming Wrong conversation you you guys want to keep going on he just agreed with me it's not it was an entailment of

(1:04:39) his logic oh okay all right Austin are you able to pull back up the uh let's see so you also wrote uh and when she

() 

(1:04:47) admitted to her past a bullying you instead doubl down on the sled haming she only played along because that is how wounded girls receive validation I

(1:04:54) think that's already been address yeah no that's that no no got to n got to get got to get into this okay

(1:05:01) so I I want you to see what you can you can you read out what you wrote out loud there for me if you don't

(1:05:08) mind oh which part oh uh so uh right there with and so this is going to be uh

(1:05:15) paragraph four admitted and when she admitted of her past bullying and harassment un said double down on the [ __ ] shaming she only played along

(1:05:21) because that is how we need girls receive validation yeah so um I not only do I reject categorically the

(1:05:28) entirety of that statement but I would again ask for the demonstration uh that that is what women

(1:05:35) do pull it up again I want to make sure I get the words right uh she only played along because that is how wounded girls

(1:05:41) receive validation can you demonstrate that for me in a million years ever how would you ever demonstrate that it's a heart posture right MH people seeking

(1:05:49) validation so you just think it sure I would say it's a conviction I have and I've talked to people that have but why

(1:05:55) I believe it cuz I've talked to people in relational currency they've talked back to me and admitted in the past they

(1:06:01) when they were the most broken were looking for the most validation in the most cheap lustful usually Online ways

(1:06:08) yeah you ever heard of a guy named Ed Schultz no yeah probably not way before your time he was this big fat Democrat

(1:06:13) right just a real piece of [ __ ] yeah he came to the Democrat Party because he was a Republican and he had

(1:06:20) an epiphany while he was eating a baloney sandwich that Republicans were evil I'm not kidding you can look this

(1:06:26) up he had an epiphany for some reason this baloney sandwich gave him the Epiphany that he

(1:06:32) needed to switch over to become a scumbag Democrat and Go On by the way to do horrible things okay um the idea what

(1:06:41) do you think that he was wounded was no why but why are the women then why are the women always wounded or have some

(1:06:49) trauma that we have to base their decisions on I don't I don't understand this view this view really bothers me

(1:06:56) because this is actually I think in this way I have way more respect for women uh

(1:07:02) than gentlemen like you do because I do not infantilize I'm not trying to infantilize but how is that not

(1:07:08) infantilization to make the statement that the reason you're doing what you're doing is because you're broken rather

(1:07:13) than maybe they're not broken they made this Choice actively and they like it what about that I would say my Approach

(1:07:20) comes from a place of compassion knowing that the person is not yielding the Fulfillment that they wish to from that and that they're is a greater way that

(1:07:26) comes through Christ and I think approaching people knowing that they are searching and that no one's completely

(1:07:32) content and fulfilled in their Sin from my perspective like I said I see that in scripture I see that God commands

(1:07:38) everywhere to repent he says that [Music] it's no Andrew all goes back to

(1:07:44) Childhood trauma hasn't Des ree taught you anything you need to revisit the bad

(1:07:50) [ __ ] handbook GI I'm sorry giovan I'm sorry my bad that came in automatic

(1:07:55) please do you want to Luke if you want to just I was just finishing the point that says the scripture is clear 1

(1:08:00) Timothy 2:4 I think it talks about that it's God's desire that all men are saved and I think it is our responsibility as

(1:08:06) Christians to Echo that and call others to repentance and also realize too that people choose sin for a reason it yes

(1:08:12) obviously it is enticing but they also choose it for negative reasons and I think that all of those negative reasons and all those desires that are

(1:08:18) unfulfilled that if eternity has been written on our human hearts and we are searching for life and life abundantly I

(1:08:23) think instead of just dragging them go go ahead you're thinking no I'm listening oh yeah if they're searching

(1:08:28) for life and life abundantly I think they can find that in Christ and I think more importantly too realizing that

(1:08:34) meeting The Sinner with the place of compassion especially when they've recognized that their sin is ultimately wrong and they don't want to be attached

(1:08:40) to it anymore but you also have to keep in mind that like for myself included I used to be addicted to pornography for a

(1:08:45) lot of my Early Childhood is that what the is that is that like the porn stash is that where that come from is that my

() 

(1:08:51) friends like it you got the porn stash going bro I'm just saying appreciate it okay anyway go ahead so used to be

(1:08:56) addicted to it for a super long period of time and and a lot of other things body dismorphia Eating Disorders it's

(1:09:01) all part of my testimony and until I actually read the word of God none of that actually changed and the word of God started to discern the thoughts and

(1:09:07) intentions of the heart right and I knew I knew that my sin was bad but I couldn't actually walk away from it because I lacked the power to and once I

(1:09:14) found that in Christ I realized okay I actually do dislike my sin and I want to walk away from it so I come from a place

(1:09:20) of compassion when I see other people that are also Bound in sexual sin and I say listen I want to come with compassion in the same way that I felt

(1:09:27) in the past as well too there is a greater way that you can be let out and I mean even to the audience too there is

(1:09:32) hope there is a way to get out of pornography in that way is Jesus Christ so let me give you the olive branch of

(1:09:37) some agreement okay and then I'm going to give you some criticism with the agreement yeah so the first idea is I am

(1:09:44) very glad that you got away from all of that and I'm very glad that you found Christ right though I may not agree with

(1:09:52) your theology it's still far better for you be going down this path which will eventually by the way lead you to

(1:09:57) Orthodoxy um it's far better for you to be going down this path than down some other path so we'll just concede that

(1:10:04) see I think that that's the compassionate statement the thing is though is that I need you to also admit

(1:10:09) that based on your what you call your testimony that you could be operating from something which is called affirmation bias and this is the idea

(1:10:17) that because this was your walk and because you had other externalities which were influencing your behavior

(1:10:24) that then you kind of suppose that onto other people isn't that a really

(1:10:31) reasonable thing for me to think yeah no it absolutely is I've talked with a lot of young men um and even women too that

(1:10:37) are bound up in sexual sin and I've talked to them all and it all does come from a place of listen I know you know like what Paul says in Romans like I

(1:10:44) know I shouldn't do this but I still find myself doing it and I lack the power to be free then he goes on to say thank our Lord Jesus Christ who has set

(1:10:50) us free and so when I come across with the message of compassion I see that not only in Christ who you know wept over

(1:10:56) Jerusalem because they could wouldn't repent and he you know he used largely Tax Collectors prostitutes but but isn't

(1:11:02) compassion the idea of compassion me telling you what's true even if you don't like it yeah and it isn't that

(1:11:09) really what I'm doing just telling you kind of like you probably didn't want to hear that you could be suffering from

(1:11:14) affirmation bias but your logical brain went no that's true there's a good possibility here that that's true right

(1:11:21) yeah what's what's non-comp passionate about saying that to you

(1:11:26) no I mean I think I I value that Insight that you're saying I might be coming from an affirmation bias I've just seen

(1:11:32) so far what I've run on when I talk to people when I talk about sexual sin is that you do a a place of compassion

(1:11:37) obviously responsibility and you hold them accountable for their actions but at the same time compassion as well too knowing that they have usually been like

(1:11:44) I said bought a bill of goods but the trick to affirmation bias is that all

(1:11:49) the contact that you have with people within the frame of the worldview yeah is going to be moved to Leading some

(1:11:56) type of evidence towards your affirmation by that so in other words this becomes part of the world viiew

(1:12:02) that you view everything in you turn everything into part of that worldview

(1:12:07) to support the affirmation bias right like that's that's what what happens that's what that means yeah so while you

(1:12:13) say okay anecdotally though Andrew most of the people that I've engaged with who are engaged in sexual sin whatever that

(1:12:20) sample size is right let's say it's huge let's say it's like 20,000 people it's probably not right but but let's just

(1:12:25) say that it was if you then said and in my experience is that all of them X and

(1:12:32) it just so happens to correlate with this other thing which happened to me doesn't that kind of seem a bit biased

(1:12:39) and moving towards that considering how widely different people are yeah yeah it just sounds like affirmation bias it's

(1:12:45) affirmation bias do you think there are people that are bound up in sexual sin that don't regret it ad all yeah okay

(1:12:51) yeah yeah I would I would I really do I think I think that the the idea here of a prelest sincere

(1:12:59) hypocrit donated $100 Desi flashes her nasty booty in Andrew's face and risked harming the

(1:13:06) stream yet this feminist is constantly acting like men must be responsible for these woman's action yeah but clown hang

(1:13:14) on this is good though because he's he is listening right so I'm I'm going to listen to him and he's listening to me

(1:13:21) so um so back to this the this idea of

(1:13:27) prels which I believe is a is a real thing Define the term I'm yeah that's

(1:13:32) what I'm doing right okay so what prelest is is that somebody has submitted so much to the Demonic okay

(1:13:38) right um that no they don't they don't have these kinds of same sincere regrets

(1:13:44) things like these types of people that you may be a serial killer let's look at that for instance right you've given

(1:13:50) over so much now that doesn't mean that you can't be saved MH but you've become so rotten to your core that you reject

(1:13:58) even the idea of Salvation yeah okay and I think it's absurd to think that those

(1:14:04) people not only don't exist but that we don't deal with them all the time we just kind of pretend there's this kind

(1:14:09) of Crux where no it's it's external factors it's always something else and

(1:14:15) it's such kind of like female psychoanalysis Babel when they always are people are always trying to find a

() 

(1:14:21) an externality instead of just going you know people have the capacity in free will to make choices mhm and sometimes

(1:14:29) they might make the wrong choice for the wrong reason and know it and just not give a

(1:14:35) [ __ ] would you say that you have an Evidence to prove that people love it and they genuinely don't have any

(1:14:41) regrets all we can do is go off of what they say what else can you what like what else can you do other than the ter

(1:14:47) you used for the for the rep probate can you what was that term again what the reprobate mind preest preest okay is

(1:14:53) that not in scripture I'm assuming uming is it somewhere else it's part of the Orthodox teaching and yes everything is backed in in in scripture is the word

(1:15:01) bible in scripture no it means collection of okay yeah so no the word bible is not in script so the idea the idea is that you can use words which are

(1:15:08) not bound in scripture but that scripture reinforces I mostly mean the idea being taught how about the word Trinity is that in scripture father Son

(1:15:14) and Holy Ghost yeah sorry I asked you is the word Trinity it's a human term that we use it's a human to right so the

(1:15:20) thing is is like me giving you the idea for what the thing is when I say in scripture sorry I sorry finish sentence

(1:15:25) I don't want to interrupt yeah so me giving you the idea for what the thing is the word itself does not need to appear in the Bible Jesus Christ himself

(1:15:32) said his wisdom would fill the enormity of all libraries right and of course it

(1:15:37) would yeah you cannot you have to extrapolate all principles past just the

(1:15:42) Bible that's why you're given those principles yeah I when I said in scripture I mostly I sorry if I

(1:15:48) communicated just the word I mean the idea where it's saying listen yes the idea of prelest is all over scripture

(1:15:53) you can read it in Matthew you can read it Luke you can Le it in John yeah I I want to read more on this could you have the references yeah I'll send you all

(1:15:59) the references perect yep thank you yep on preist and you'll see it you'll see the theme all through there yes of

(1:16:04) course there are going to be people uh who choose these things what do you think Free Will is what like what if you

(1:16:12) did if you don't have free will right how could you choose to do the evil path

(1:16:18) you wouldn't yeah otherwise this would be predetermination which is a calvinist belief right it's it's not even possible

(1:16:24) for you to Reon that there couldn't be people who freely choose to do evil cuz they just like it

(1:16:30) yeah like I don't know how you logically get around that if you really think you have free will I think there's people

(1:16:37) can be double-minded I think they can like something and also regret it at the same time and I would rather appeal to the side of them having a conviction but

(1:16:43) that's not based in logic or Reason okay you're you're just saying you're just saying this you're say I have no

(1:16:48) evidence of this MH right no real evidence of this but I do know other than personal anecdote yeah other than

(1:16:54) personal but do know Free Will exists but for some reason I'm choosing to believe that nobody's Free Will would

(1:17:00) ever lead them to go down the path of doing Horrors because they just want

(1:17:05) to like that's not free will then that would be something else that's other than right there's the two members in

(1:17:12) Romans I think it's still yeah Romans 7 that work within you and they pull you either way and I know myself too I have

(1:17:17) to struggle with two Wills of you know what I know I should do and what I don't want to do sure but is it going to be

(1:17:23) true of everyone that even if they have a pulling Force let's say left and right in this case just like simplify it yeah

(1:17:30) that some people may not even acknowledge either and don't care and just do what they want yeah and they have the willpower to do that they are

(1:17:36) given that great gift of Free Will right yeah so I I just don't know a way around that logically I would just say when I

(1:17:42) approach someone I see those two Wills the left and the right and I would always want to pull on the right versus shaming them for the actions that they

(1:17:48) take when they what if okay but what if you had a crystal ball okay and inside this Crystal Ball it said okay if you

(1:17:53) shame this person right they will move to that tug right yeah would you shame them then I don't like the word shame

(1:18:00) yeah I know but you didn't answer the question would I shame them no I probably wouldn't even if you knew that

(1:18:05) the result would be what if it was the only way like that's the only way they would respond to the message of Christ

(1:18:12) was to to make them experience shame and do it on purpose if you had a crystal ball it was Clairvoyant you knew for

(1:18:19) sure that was the only would you do it then Titus 3:2 says to speak evil of no man um so personally a conviction I have

(1:18:26) is not to do that these are subjective terms yes but you're you're setting me up with a false dilemma where no I'm

(1:18:31) setting you up with a hypothetical there's no dilemma here right that's false it's hypothetical it's designed to be false to test the logic yeah so the

(1:18:39) idea here is would you if you clairvoyantly could look ahead and see

() 

(1:18:46) that only shame could be applied to bring the ex person to Christ would you

(1:18:52) do it no no from personal conviction yes so okay so then um backing up right if

(1:18:59) that is not the case would you shame somebody else who would shame somebody if it brought them to Christ I don't

(1:19:06) think I would shame them then what would you say I would try and correct them okay so if you're unwilling to use shame

(1:19:12) as a resource right and another person is but you're unwilling to shame the fact that they shame people why should

(1:19:19) they even respond to anything you say to them why shouldn't they just be like well this is really effective you're not going to you're not going to say

(1:19:25) anything about it right how effective is that I don't believe that the Holy Spirit Works to shame I think it does

(1:19:32) all the time I think he works to convict but I don't think he works to condemn I think it works to shame constantly look

(1:19:39) like what is hell to you I mean do you want the literal answer the literal answer what is hell

(1:19:45) to you it's the eternal torment the the eternal torment you can experience shame probably does God allow this to happen

(1:19:52) yeah okay well so I don't understand inside inside a Biblical text itself

(1:19:58) shame happens all the time the money changers were experiencing shame in the temple that's what that was a corded

(1:20:04) whip you're being shamed out of here shame even the woman of the well the idea there was shaming her yeah like how

(1:20:12) do you how do you get around that I think shaming is part of your identity I think when you communicate with someone I think you don't want to default to the

(1:20:18) fact that your identity is wrapped up in your sin I think you want to communicate the fact that their sin is pulling them towards that place of Eternal tor yeah I

(1:20:25) don't but but I don't disagree yeah that that is is um is true what I'm

(1:20:31) disagreeing with is the pathway of getting there clearly shame is a highly

(1:20:37) effective tool yeah right even your friends going hey you packed on too much weight that's a shaming tactic to get

(1:20:43) you to stop eating you said you had an eating disorder right were you ashamed of it yeah i' say so wasn't that a

(1:20:50) powerful motivator it was a powerful motivator then what is I don't understand the problem here bro I think it's it's externally projecting shame

(1:20:55) onto other people saying you should be shamed for your actions but somebody externally projected shame onto you and

() 

(1:21:00) that was a powerful motivator for you not for the eating disorder what nobody gave you any shame

(1:21:08) for the eating disorder people did but I ultimately I actually the more shame that they gave me the worse it got oh I

(1:21:13) see so uh in this case again we're not dealing with affirmation bias because in

(1:21:19) your particular case when you felt shamed you wouldn't you refused to uh

(1:21:25) you know do anything about the behavior you double down which source of Pride right but you do realize that other people respond very well to shame many

(1:21:32) many times they they uh they respond well to shame like even in your own life for instance um with a kid right do you

(1:21:39) think would you ever spank a child spank a child sure yeah it says in Proverbs would you ever do it in public

(1:21:47) probably not why not because I think discipline is something that's you know domestic should be done inside the home

(1:21:52) why it doesn't say anything about that in that's a it's just what I think yeah right it's just what you yeah is it okay

(1:21:59) for someone else to spank your kid in public it's probably their own personal conviction you don't care I think it depends on the society and where you are

(1:22:06) is there a little bit of Shame do you think the kid feels a lot of Shame when you take him over the knee and you swat

(1:22:12) his ass in front of everybody is there a little shame involved there yeah probably yeah probably and does it is

(1:22:17) the Bible specifically saying in Proverbs spare the rod spoil the child

(1:22:23) right yeah it's literally giving you the antidote here say now do you think that spanking the kid or the Bible is saying

(1:22:30) to abuse the child I don't think he's saying to Abus is it saying to beat the child no is it even saying really to

(1:22:35) hurt the child no so then what is the effectiveness of the of the spanking the effectiveness of the spanking is

(1:22:40) discipline it's the shame I don't think it's the shame it's the shame dude how could it not be if you I've seen kids

(1:22:47) for instance their mother is spank them and the spanking doesn't even hurt them their mom's hands are so weak when they

(1:22:53) paddle their ass right it doesn't do anything to them they cry anyway why

(1:22:58) because it hurts and their parents because they feel ashamed no discipline for the present time is pleasing they

(1:23:04) feel ashamed that their mama spanked their ass they they're ter they're ashamed right that's why they're crying

(1:23:11) even though they're not in any physical pain yeah how can you say that this is a bad prescription when it's a Biblical prescription I think I think a good

(1:23:17) parent would be able to communicate the fact that I still love you I'm doing this for your own good I'm not trying to sh not going to lessen the shame okay

(1:23:24) how would that lessen the shame oh I love you you had it coming because you [ __ ] up you did A B and C you weren't

(1:23:31) supposed to do that right yeah the shame is what's making them cry right the shame is what makes them want to adjust

(1:23:38) paths here we're awfully in the weeds here I don't think we're off in the weeds here I think that we are doubling we're we're coming down to your idea of

(1:23:44) what shame is you say it's never it's never okay to correct via shame and I'm giving you a direct example that you

(1:23:51) believe in as a correction which causes shame I think verbally versus physically I

(1:23:57) think they're interpreting it as shame but I think you could Comm what is shame other than interpretation you could

(1:24:03) communicate verbally that you're not trying to shame the person while still applying to some so what it's still if you verb okay so wait a second so if you

(1:24:10) walk over to a woman who's really heavy set you say Hey you [ __ ] right yeah I'm not trying to verbally shame you but you

(1:24:17) just did well okay right so then if that is the case how would that not be the case with spanking would you say oh I

(1:24:24) wasn't trying to shame you right it's a punishment yeah I wasn't trying to shame you but I'm shaming you that's I mean

(1:24:30) that's why you're crying right you're crying cuz you're ashamed of what it is that you did you're ashamed that I had to spank you you're ashamed of all of

(1:24:37) this right isn't that why kids are crying when they're not feeling physical pain from the actual spanking but

(1:24:42) they're feeling shame that their mama had to spank them sure so I mean I'll I'll concede your point on spanking but

(1:24:49) then that's a prescription for shame you're prescribing shame not verbally

(1:24:54) yeah I don't know man I don't know what the distinct so like physical shame okay but not verbal shame isn't that a

(1:25:01) contradiction in terms could be I I'll just say from my personal experience and where I've been and the convictions that

(1:25:06) I've been led to I don't see it's ever fruitful to shame someone for their actions um I think Paul you know he he

(1:25:12) definitely people cried right The Godly sorrow that leads to repentance and I think that it's important to speak the truth but it's always important

(1:25:18) knowledge uh 1 Corinthians 8 says knowledge puffeth up but love edifies and I think you always do want to

(1:25:24) communic discipline in love calling someone to a higher standard versus I think the enemy does a great job when people have issues and things that they

(1:25:30) already feel ashamed for and they don't want to bring it to light when you then project oh your identity is this and

(1:25:35) your identity is that I'm just going to continue to double down and [ __ ] shame you for your actions in the past and things that you actually do regret I

(1:25:42) which I still do believe I do believe people have some inkling of conscience that convicts them I personally in my

(1:25:48) wheelhouse do not want to use shame as a motivator okay then let me ask you ask

(1:25:54) you more followup here okay so uh this reminds me of an anecdote I'd like you to speak to okay so um when I was a kid

(1:26:03) uh I was inside of a little like Mini Mart with my dad I was maybe five or six years old MH I stole a candy bar okay

(1:26:09) snuck it put it in my pocket yeah now I was stupid right when I got out in the vehicle I just like pulled the candy bar

(1:26:15) out and started eating it right in front of my dad yeah right and he was like uh where'd you get that and I was like oh

(1:26:21) well you know the guy the guy gave it to me when you weren't looking right he gave it to me when you weren't looking yeah now I got to ask you are

(1:26:29) children more vulnerable than adult women sure yeah and are adult men less

(1:26:35) vulnerable than children yeah okay great my dad marched my ass in that convenience store he paid

() 

(1:26:43) for the candy bar right and he gave me the worst verbal lashing you could ever

(1:26:49) imagine yeah right I was in tears I was apologizing to the clerk right he just

(1:26:55) tore into me got back got in the car and I said dad I feel terrible and he said

(1:27:01) good now you know what I never did again guess stole never yeah how was that not

(1:27:08) 100% the Walk of Shame he walked me in he shamed my ass in front of that clerk

(1:27:14) he shamed me uh made me take the Walk of Shame back out then he got home told my mom right she went in on me right this

(1:27:23) was like it was just a Pyon Andrew Wilson jamere okay I'm sure I don't even

(1:27:29) remember but I'm sure even my brother probably went by and was like and that's what you get I never stole another thing

(1:27:35) in my life yeah right how is that not totally effective and totally what

(1:27:40) Proverbs is really trying to get across here while I argue that it might be effective and it might have worked for

(1:27:46) your personal anecdote um I think per when it comes to discipline when it comes to correction I think shame based

(1:27:52) on the opinions of others and their opinion of you ultimately does take away from finding your identity and opinion

(1:27:58) of yourself in Christ I think understanding that you when you are born again you are the you do have the righteousness of Christ and I think

(1:28:04) shame is an attack from the enemy to make you think that your actions are what your identity is based out of you couldn't say that shame itself was evil

(1:28:12) itself that's never stated anywhere in gospel no that's one and two uh you I've

(1:28:18) given you now multiple examples where shame can be used from the place of pure love in order to get you to stop a

(1:28:24) horrific Behavior you would not ordinarily do um when you're 5 6 years old you can't understand

(1:28:31) conceptualizations of ownership yet yeah what conceptualization can you understand shame punishment punishment

(1:28:38) shame you can definitely understand shame people don't like when I do this right everybody really doesn't like when

(1:28:45) I do this thing that is that is social shaming that's the same thing with the brothel right if you had a brothel in

(1:28:52) town and everybody came in the town to say this is awful and you need to stop doing it yeah that's a form of social

(1:28:59) shame how's that not effective or exactly in kind of the line of what it

(1:29:04) is that you're talking about through salvation do you think Christ shamed any of the prostitutes or adulterous women

(1:29:09) that came to him it's saying go in sin no more yeah is a form of Shame it's saying the things you were doing before

(1:29:16) were sinful you must not do them that is part of the shame of that it's the same thing when Paul had his vision Paul was

(1:29:22) shamed in that vision for killing Christians he was wasn't he he was exposed to the truth yeah and and he

(1:29:29) felt great what shame yeah all right I'll leave it there all right we'll get

(1:29:35) through some more of the notes Austin if you can pull back up the

() 

(1:29:40) rest so Andrew you call yourself a Christian act like it how did Christ

(1:29:47) address the adulterous woman how did he address the woman who wiped his feet how did he address the Samaritan woman how

(1:29:53) did the Lord command Hosea to pursue his bride despite her past so Andrew you

(1:29:58) call yourself a Christian act like it do you want to respond yeah I think as we've gotten through this conversation

(1:30:04) we've actually addressed a lot of this which is interesting right um but I don't think that he's saying I'm not a

(1:30:10) Christian no he's saying that he wants me to act in such a way which confers with what he believes to be the image of

(1:30:16) Christ to be yeah to be to be Christianity I want the same thing in reverse and since I've given you these

(1:30:23) kind of great log iCal arguments then you've refuted none of them and you've demonstrated none of your worldview like

(1:30:28) none of it right and I've been willing to hear it out have these arguments and these engagements you should maybe set

(1:30:35) the pride aside right and come and conform more over to this side right

(1:30:40) where I'm trying to explain to you wait a second I'm not disputing that Christ is pure love yeah there is no dispute

(1:30:47) there my dispute is in terms when you say things like shame you have a loaded version of this when you say things

(1:30:53) compassion you have a loaded version of this which doesn't I think take into account the

(1:30:59) entirety of what these words are trying to encapsulate Christ himself engaged in

(1:31:04) shame telling people they're in sin is shame that is shaming I don't see a way

(1:31:09) around that I really don't that's fair I like I said it comes from different ways

(1:31:14) of reading um I would say you were talking about pure love um the definition of love in 1 Corinthians 13

(1:31:20) talk about believing all things bearing all things hoping all things I I read that as genuinely seeing other people

(1:31:25) and believing believing in them and hoping them for what they can become in Christ do you think I want to hurt these

(1:31:31) people who are here or do you think that I'm here to engage now I do find it fun

(1:31:37) right that's my vanity okay okay there's nothing I can do about that I think it's a blast okay is that always good for me

(1:31:44) probably not okay but I do have a lot of fun arguing I do have a lot of fun debating right can that lead to other

(1:31:51) things which are sinful of course it can playing the guitar too much could lead to sin literally not kidding I haven't

(1:31:57) had that happen yet but yeah it could okay eating too much could you know there's all sorts of different things that could but you can't honestly

(1:32:03) believe that my intention here in arguing and tangling with these people who do these horrible things and there's almost nobody representing the worldview

(1:32:11) that you have except maybe just some guy who lives on a farm somewhere who's really good at arguing right you can't

(1:32:18) possibly think I'm after trying to like hurt in any way these I've never gone after any of these personal I've never

(1:32:24) even uh talked about him kind of post show I don't even do kind of reacts to

(1:32:30) my own I don't do any of that yeah right the idea is in the moment you tangle with the idea you beat the idea and you

(1:32:37) hope right that in this like session of a few hours you can get your worldview across it's like the best you can do

(1:32:44) yeah so you know that's like that would be my one rebuttal there yeah I I I

(1:32:51) agree I think that obviously it sounds like we read the character of Christ differently um based off of the loaded

(1:32:57) terms and the the approach that we've had and the background and our personal anecdotes um but yeah like I said I I

(1:33:02) think it all largely comes back to when you're talking with someone genuinely believing in them and having hope that

(1:33:07) they will accept Christ and they will turn um and I like I said it's just the tools in the Arsenal of how you would go

(1:33:13) about doing that and breaking down their worldview um you know afflicting the comfortable and comfort comforting The

(1:33:18) Afflicted um well okay that's fair so you say we have some distinctions in Christy I think that that's fair and

(1:33:25) look I'm not um I'm I'm I'm a Layman right I'm not here to like I'm not here

(1:33:30) to pretend that I'm clergy or have all the answers here right I'm just kind of giving you the broad worldview that I

(1:33:36) have I'm still a Padawan right I'm still a Padawan learner but I would like you to retract

(1:33:41) some of these statements because you have not been able to demonstrate the statements so I mean kind of going in

(1:33:47) order and ones that stat yeah yeah yeah I'll go in order here uh the first is on this kind of loaded IDE a that Brian is

() 

(1:33:54) giving drugs to the women right and you said um you know substances and this

(1:34:00) kind of um this kind of language this vague language is veiled to say there's some kind of Nefarious purpose right

(1:34:07) that's what we say we say substance abuse things like that it's clearly cloaked in a criticism of you're giving

(1:34:14) them some kind of Nefarious thing to drug them up yeah and I wonder if you could retract and just briefly clarify

(1:34:20) that I will I I'll briefly re-clarify my my statement that I sent over text uh

(1:34:25) very late at night so the point I will retract is that I think I misread your

(1:34:31) guys intentions with both due to lack of sleep and obviously knowing someone that

(1:34:36) was on the podcast that wanted to leave and so I apologize for insinuating

(1:34:42) that you guys had a malicious intent in offering substances to keep people on your platform okay while I believe that

(1:34:47) it could be read that way when the platform does go later than insinuated

(1:34:53) uh for you know financial gain but um yeah I I'll trct the statement now in many of these you're going to get a lot

(1:34:59) of charitability back from me yeah not on this one okay and here's why right

(1:35:05) because it it infers almost like um in the modern feminist gynocentric world

(1:35:10) that we live in it almost infers that Brian is like drugging these women for

(1:35:17) the purposes of just getting like entertainment out of them for a bunch of in you know what I mean that's where the

(1:35:23) criticism leads so I'm not really going to be charitable back on this one you were just wrong on this one and you need

(1:35:29) to just eat that uh the second one if you can pull that list up real quick

(1:35:37) Brian um scroll up I think yeah yeah uh so uh when it when it gets into the you

(1:35:44) don't know what paperwork she signed keeping her until midnight despite multiple request was incredible disrespectful okay so from this one I

(1:35:51) can see from the external View that you go past time someone's trying to convince you to say you could you could

(1:35:57) assume that that's disrespectful however with context I wonder if you would be willing to attract that statement as

(1:36:03) well as you agreed it takes two to tango they willingly came on the show and you

(1:36:08) had evidence that Brian did tell them that it may go past that and so that really isn't a fair criticism ultimately

(1:36:15) I don't think I have enough information to fully retract um most because of the comment of just yeah that not I don't

(1:36:21) did you guys communicate to them when they were be able to leave well no it's open-ended right it could go from A to B

(1:36:26) to Z that but that's every podcast by the way that's basically if it's IRL if it's like a show if you're if you're on

(1:36:33) CNN right you get N9 minutes and that's all you're going to get okay because that's the format an IRL podcast though

(1:36:40) which goes anywhere from 4 to 6 to 8 hours there's no real good reasonable expectation I think a person would have

(1:36:47) that if we go past time um there was some like kind of Nefarious purpose

(1:36:52) behind that it's kind of silly right yeah it might it might be silly on my part and I do apologize obviously you okay are are correct in calling out I

(1:36:58) probably have a lot of Pride baked into this and I I apologize I'm sorry if I did come across in a way that was judgmental okay genuinely I do want to

(1:37:05) learn and I want to be I think it's okay to assess judgment like that's it's okay to judge things otherwise how do you get

(1:37:10) through life right like you have to make at least value judgments right so this value judgment I can at least charitably

(1:37:16) say I understand why you made it yeah but perhaps now with more context we can just get like kind of a basic retraction

(1:37:23) there uh and then can you pull the list up one more time be a good clip um second your treatment of

(1:37:30) Nicollet was an excusable she's clearly broken so on this one again going to be very charitable back I understand the

(1:37:37) worldview that there must be some kind of like trauma or externality especially considering your history and how you

(1:37:43) came to Christianity and all of this so I'm I'm going to take like all those things into consideration and say I

(1:37:49) understand how you came to that view yeah right but can you concede that from from my perview from my view no there's

(1:37:57) really no good evidence that a lot of these women are broken and rather they're just making the choice to do

(1:38:03) this thing because they really want to do it because there's a lot of money right they make a lot of money I'll

(1:38:08) concede that yeah from your worldview that you've explained to me I think it makes sense the behavior that you do to go about your way of uh tearing down

(1:38:14) their worldview and yeah communicating with them yeah okay I think it and then last one Brian if you don't mind um you

(1:38:20) go down uh third and we didn't even get to this criticism yeah there's still some

(1:38:25) more to get through yeah yeah I'd like to I'd like to address this one um one just one moment Dore Snider donated $100

(1:38:33) thank you Dan apprciate Paul said he'd go to hell if his brothers would be saved this guy doesn't know God or

(1:38:39) what's at stake because he won't use shame to save the Lost repent this is

(1:38:45) why the American church is so weak but we're still going to try to be charitable with it right I I agree I

(1:38:50) actually agree with what Dane's saying here but in the in the spirit of being charitable I at least now understand why

(1:38:57) you came to your view how you came to your viiew and so I have some respect there okay okay so I mean that's I I can

(1:39:04) still disagree with the view but have respect for how you came to the view um but this this this one the third one we

(1:39:11) didn't get to do you agree with the statement that I don't know God no okay no well here's the thing right um my my

(1:39:17) parents are Protestants right and I remember asking a priest you know

(1:39:24) like I came to this through protestantism and he's like yeah all of American Orthodoxy basically came

(1:39:30) through this through through protestantism I would never and no Orthodox by the way will ever make a

(1:39:36) salvific claim or say that you don't know God yeah that would never be a

(1:39:41) claim that we would make we would claim that you don't know the fullness of the truth that's what we would say but

(1:39:46) anyway back to this um the third one here I'm sorry third car holds her

(1:39:54) person con gu personal yeah personal convictions regarding bowing to her

(1:40:00) husband yeah that's a good one because the Lord's guidance in her past you are right it is not specifically commanded

(1:40:05) in the Bible but submission to Authority is granted on the fact the authority does not commands you to sin okay so um

(1:40:11) let's find a halfway point here totally agree that um Authority that commands you to sin is Authority that must be

(1:40:18) resisted yeah okay must it must be resisted but I would argue that that the

(1:40:23) way that you know sins through reason and the compliance of God's nature is the LOI mhm logic reason yeah okay it's

() 

(1:40:30) part of God's nature you would agree that that's true and so we would have to determine which way you're being led

(1:40:35) based on reason and if you're being told to do something unreasonable would you agree with that sure okay how is bowing

(1:40:43) unreasonable this say what I'll will have to default to her on it was a personal conviction I think uh as I

(1:40:49) outlined in scripture I think causing someone to stumble even though they don't have the full knowledge right that like you know eating meat

(1:40:55) offered in the temple to Idols like there's no other gods right but some people still didn't have the full conscience and the knowledge of the

(1:41:01) truth and their conscious were still weak so Paul's like yeah that causes someone else to sin and they their faith is weakened yeah I won't do that I won't

(1:41:07) command them to do that and so that was the standard what I was going by and that but that would comply with reason sure yeah so this is in compliance with

(1:41:13) reason this doesn't actually answer to how bowing it's I I don't think bowing is sinful so if a husband says to a wife

(1:41:22) like look I I am insecure yeah you know what baby I'm insecure and you know what makes me feel really good when you bow

(1:41:30) yeah shouldn't she bow I don't think so I don't think that would help her husband um grow in Christ personally why

(1:41:37) because he's finding his validation if it just helps his insecurity because he's finding his validation in someone other than

(1:41:42) Christ I'm sorry um if if a man cries mhm right and his

(1:41:49) wife is comforting him when he's is that finding validation other than Christ I think his wife can support him but I ultimately believe his wife should Point

(1:41:55) him back to Christ yeah but he's not lost Christ where's the loss Happening Here you so when you're talking about

(1:42:03) idolatry here idolatry is the replacement of God yeah you're not replacing God by uh you know C or your

(1:42:11) wife crying on your lap for instance she's not idolizing you that's not a replacement for God I mean we're getting

(1:42:16) into the weeds here based off the heart no I I'm going to keep going on this but mostly this comes from the biblical

(1:42:22) understanding of how I see husbands love your wives as Christ led the church and I don't think Christ demanded that sort

(1:42:27) of bow and that sort of um okay could be getting in the weeds there yeah I'm sorry didn't people get on their knees

(1:42:33) and worship Christ they did oh well that's that's interesting isn't it yeah well it's I mean obvious understanding the husband can you worship your are you

(1:42:39) supposed to and who's the bride who's the bride oh the church and so the church got on their knees and worship

(1:42:44) and I'm sorry I just want to make sure I got this right in are you not commanded uh wives submit to your

(1:42:52) husband as unto who okay and everybody bowed to the Lord yeah and everybody bowed to

(1:42:58) Jesus Christ and worshiped him openly right yeah okay well then I I don't I don't understand the how you reconcile

(1:43:04) this I think if for someone with a heart posture and a conviction and a past that would cause them to tend to idolize the

(1:43:10) person they're submitting to and show reverence for God I think that could be communicated in a healthy relationship I get it so let me let me make sure I get

(1:43:17) this right I'm going to steal man it okay if bowing if a woman has a past where she

(1:43:24) thinks that bowing to her husband is going to somehow lead her away from Jesus she shouldn't bow yeah got it I

(1:43:31) agree 100% but shouldn't that comport with reason yes and if it doesn't comport

(1:43:38) with reason isn't she just being kind of an obstinate brat maybe yeah so I mean if so if your wife is just like I'm not

(1:43:45) going to bow to you even though you've commanded me to do so and it comports with reason why you want to be bowed to

(1:43:52) yeah she should [ __ ] bow right I don't think husbands should demand respect I think they should earn it well

(1:43:58) that's not demanding respect maybe you're maybe you just like to watch her bow because it's fun like what's wrong

(1:44:04) with that I I don't think that's a good example of Christlike love should we play the bow the thing is the thing is

(1:44:10) is like this is this is where you're getting the idea of submission and obeyence which is always so bothersome to me to submit is to obey sure okay to

(1:44:18) lead is not to justify sure yeah so if that is the case why do I need to justify why I want you

(1:44:25) the obeyer to do the thing I want you to do who you're supposed to obey as long as it comports with

(1:44:31) reason because I'm going to go back to the model of Christ in the church okay I

(1:44:37) think obedience is for your benefit and I think Obed demanding justification

(1:44:42) agreed demanding justification is not always to your benefit no but I do think things that come out of a place of

(1:44:48) insecurity and then demanding obedience in those ways that you the obeyer are

(1:44:54) not the determiner of where that's a justification that's requesting justification for the thing to request

(1:45:00) the justification is not obeying it's the opposite of obeying why does a husband need to endlessly justify the

(1:45:06) things that he wants from his wife he's the leader she's the obeyer why why is

(1:45:12) this this kind of idea of like endless justification necessary unless he asks you to do something directly which is

(1:45:18) sinful MH shouldn't she do it depends on the relationship I would

(1:45:25) say largely yeah she should obey she should obey yeah so bow when you serve my food bow what am I asking you do

(1:45:31) that's a sin tell me why does he need her to Bow he doesn't have to justify

(1:45:37) that to her we've established this why does he need to justify endlessly what he's asking her to

(1:45:43) do again if Christ told his Apostles to bow y does he need to justify it Christ

(1:45:50) was guard God incarnate yeah that but I'm sorry what are we representing here in marriage yeah it's a it's a type

(1:45:56) absolutely and you're supposed to as unto who as unto the Lord okay so very strange that now I have to justify even

(1:46:03) though I'm supposed to be the representation of of Christ who did not have to justify so yeah this is where I

(1:46:09) think modern women get submission wrong they don't seem to understand that in obeyence is not the request of

(1:46:16) justification that is not oh to obey that is to not obey for me to ask you to

(1:46:21) endlessly justify everything you do if you're not asking me to do anything that does not contort to

(1:46:27) reason how is that me obeying there's a lot of words how is it

(1:46:33) well let me simplify it how is it me obeying to ask you to justify the thing that you asked me to do if it's not a

(1:46:40) sin you're right you have a point and I I think the important part too is understanding like I said the heart of

(1:46:46) obedience and that you would obey someone because you see what their point and what their goal is yeah okay so

(1:46:52) that's fair okay so I would say if there's there's a point and there's a goal like this is a

(1:46:57) humiliation ritual designed to punish you you know what I mean or something like this uh that would lead to sinful

() 

(1:47:05) Behavior I can get that right but what I don't get is the idea that modern women

(1:47:11) and this is a pure feminist take I'm just going to tell you right it's a pure feminist take there's an obeyer and then

(1:47:18) there's the obeyed yeah if the husband is the obeyed the obeyed do not need to justify to the obeyer and we have the

(1:47:25) clear criteria of to sin so to sin would be when you no longer obey so if you're

(1:47:30) being requested to do a thing and it's not to sin don't you think they should

(1:47:36) obey I think but they could also communicate if it was a good healthy relationship they could communicate that they were being tempted yeah but it's

(1:47:43) also healthy to not do Indulgence and constantly have to justify everything you do especially if you're trying to

(1:47:49) lead you can imagine for instance a general having to tell a second command justify every move he wants to make on

(1:47:54) the board that's not for him to question it's for him to obey as long as it comports with reason so if the general

(1:48:01) says go surrender to the enemy well now we have a problem right but before that the goal is in question yeah because now

(1:48:07) the goal is in qu so but before that any order he gives is lawful right yeah and

(1:48:12) so should be obeyed MH how how does this not conform the exact same way here I think the relational D Dynamics are

(1:48:18) interesting because bowing does signific significate I think difference inequality and um level of authority and

(1:48:25) I think the authority can be given to the husband they're not equal you're not equal I think they are no they're not I think they're equal in value value is

(1:48:32) not the same as being equal materially meaning this they're equal in role but same in no listen sorry sorry not equal

(1:48:38) in role equal in value but different in role yeah then that's not equal because you can have some roles which are more

(1:48:44) significant than others that's not equality it's the opposite of equality so for instance

(1:48:49) um I agree with you yeah that a woman is equal to a man ontologically her soul is

() 

(1:48:54) worth just as much she's just she's every bit as valuable unless we're on a ship unless we're on a ship where

(1:49:00) requires a lot of physical strength this type of thing her physical value now is not anywhere near what my physical value

(1:49:07) is do you think her intellectual or emotional value would compensate no okay what about why would it what about her

(1:49:12) ability to like what what is her what is her like emotional her emotional investment in running the what is that

(1:49:18) going to do it doesn't assist with the running of the ship so when you make it this kind of like role difference differential yeah your role is to lead

(1:49:24) and your role is to follow you're actually saying Point Blank you are not equal here one is the obeyer right and

(1:49:32) one is to be obeyed you're making a category error you say both of you are

(1:49:39) 100% equal ontologically your soul yeah the thing that makes you you mhm totally

(1:49:44) equal to the thing that makes me me yeah I have no dispute with that have a dispute when we get to the role idea

(1:49:50) though you are not equal in Ro you are not you are to be obeyed and they are to

(1:49:57) obey that is submission I I don't see a way around that yeah I think it just comes up the

(1:50:04) heart of why you're commanding the thing yeah but but why do you need to justify that because I think you're

(1:50:10) supposed to model Christ and I think yeah but Christ didn't have to make these justifications but Christ laid down his

(1:50:16) life to serve not to be served yeah but but what does that mean exactly that he laid when he lays down his life to serve

(1:50:24) right he says I am the way and you must obey me everything everything that he

(1:50:31) commands you must do because you love him yeah so everything that he commands you must do MH okay so if the wife is

(1:50:37) supposed to treat the husband as unto the Lord everything he obeys which is

(1:50:43) within the criteria of what Christ commands she must obey I think in

(1:50:48) imitating Christ as a husband operating out of insecurity to ask for a thou would be in direct contrast of the

() 

(1:50:55) character of Christ yeah but when you say insecurity I would say the opposite I'd say it's the most secure thing you can do as a husband to not endlessly

(1:51:02) burden your family with nonsensical justifications from women making endless

(1:51:08) demands for them when it's unnecessary for instance do you think it's good for your wife to constantly second guess you

(1:51:15) no no it's not that but that's a justification the second guessing is the asking and requesting of justification

(1:51:21) that's second guessing yes but I think you would be showing her through your character and she would eventually learn to trust you based off of your intent

(1:51:28) and your purpose together she doesn't need to learn to trust you she's your wife that's already inferred that's already implied that's already done

(1:51:34) otherwise why'd you get married I think it grows with time right yeah maybe but right from the beginning are you saying

(1:51:39) we can only have a Biblical marriage after seven years or can we do it right away no you start from the beginning yeah it's not for her to endlessly

(1:51:46) question the authority of her husband it's not for her to do and this is a modern a modern Christian view this has

(1:51:54) never been the view historically in Christianity ever that you were to consult your wife about blah it's never

(1:52:01) been the view ever when has that ever been the view honestly I I don't think obviously church history I haven't

(1:52:07) studied Church bowing and husband wife relationships but I would say just being pure in heart especially me and wanting

(1:52:13) to guard my intentions and actions and why I would demand that from someone I like I said maybe it's a personal bias

(1:52:18) maybe I'm reading into this too much but I would say that coming from that perspective I don't think that's something you could justify largely

(1:52:25) speaking because I think the tendency would be to come from a place of Pride then let me ask you this if you think

(1:52:30) that that's actually true do you think that the world right now the United States would be a better place or a worse place if wives mostly did what

(1:52:38) their husband said I don't know if I can answer that question think about it for a second do

(1:52:44) you think that the United States would be a better place assigning which one do you think is more right what no just

(1:52:50) which one do you think has the burden of responsibility and if it's their job to lead it's your job to be led and if you

(1:52:57) won't allow yourself to be led how can anybody lead it's it's this adage of what men have the authority why won't

(1:53:03) you give it to them then well they have to earn it well then they never had it so the question becomes to you would the

(1:53:10) United States do you think be better right now if wives did a lot more

(1:53:17) listening and doing what their husband said or less I I think I would still need more

(1:53:22) time to think about yeah and take as much time as you need all right Austin can you pull back

(1:53:28) up the uh the sheet please wrong one okay um yeah what does that mean that

(1:53:35) she doesn't push her convictions on that who are we talking about there well so and just to finish I guess reading this

(1:53:40) Kari does not want to put herself in a situation to idolize a man bowing itself is not a sin but that movement

(1:53:46) encourages that that heart posture a true husband would never have

(1:53:52) any any reason to ask her to Bow short of his own insecurity if you want scripture to back this idea up of

(1:53:59) offending another's conscience please consult Romans 14223 and 1 Corinthians 84 actually we can we can consult both

(1:54:07) um when you're talking about the offense to the conscience I think in this context

(1:54:14) um it's food yeah what well yeah but what we're talking about specifically

(1:54:20) here is not offending some somebody's conscience what if their conscience is wrong yeah you would inform them yeah

(1:54:26) you can in well not only that but you can't you have to risk offense to inform them M I would say you inform them

(1:54:32) before you demand the action yeah but you still are so what what what did the apostles get killed for wasn't it for

(1:54:39) offending the conscience of others no I'd say it was for preaching the name of Christ it was and what did that do and

(1:54:45) then the holy spirit said it and people decided whether they wanted to repent to their sin or not yeah and it offended the conscience of the powerful

() 

(1:54:52) right and in turn the powerful killed them isn't that true sure yeah yeah so

(1:54:59) so I I'm going to take this and I'm going to say this a mischaracterization I don't even think

(1:55:05) discourse is possible without risking offense to the conscience if you're talking about worldviews I mean you can

(1:55:11) imagine if you break a person's world view down to the point where they go into cognitive dissonance yeah that is

(1:55:17) like the most offensive thing possible that you've done it's actually physic

(1:55:22) physically painful by the way you know this right it's physically painful so I

(1:55:27) I don't really understand maybe you can just clarify it for me repeat the question that the question

(1:55:33) is the offense of a person's conscience you should never do this I think

(1:55:39) offending another's person's conscience and causing them to stumble in their walk is directly from what I've read in my forte in scripture is is a command

(1:55:47) not to uh do that you're not supposed to violate another's conscience you can ex instruct them and love like I said you

(1:55:53) know love edifies versus just knowledge okay well then yeah I think we're just talking about two different things then

(1:55:59) if you're saying so if you're if you're saying that you're not supposed to cause them to stumble towards Christ yeah I

(1:56:05) agree with that okay but I think that that's different than the offense to the conscience which I think moves people

(1:56:12) towards Christ yeah so I just want to untangle those maybe you can explain it better for me I mean yeah I think the

(1:56:18) conscience is towards what Pro you what does not proceed from faith is sin and so someone one in like I said 14 Romans

(1:56:24) 14 he's talking about people feeling like things are sins that actually aren't because of the true knowledge of

(1:56:30) coming to Christ and so I think the loving thing to do is to instruct them to let them know obviously in the time

(1:56:35) being yeah listen we can eat food offered in the temple we can do these things because there's nothing

(1:56:40) inherently sinful with them to the pure all things are pure because we're talking about intentionality yes intentionality but at the time being

(1:56:46) when the person's conscience is still convicting them you wouldn't say hey eat this meat my Approach oh yeah yeah I see what

(1:56:53) you're saying so you're saying um that at the time if you were to move in to

(1:57:00) say that yeah right that would actually be counterproductive moving towards Christ yeah then why earlier did you

(1:57:06) give me the criticism that I didn't pull out my Bible and start reading it to a woman even though it would have done

(1:57:12) exactly the thing you just described and offended her conscience it would have enlightened her conscience cuz I think you're it would have offended it it

(1:57:19) would have offended it by that metric do you know that well but here's the thing here's the

(1:57:25) belies in Romans Paul Paul isn't saying you will know when you will know when it will yeah he's saying you have to assess

(1:57:31) the situation and then you'll know so if they if they're eating this right while they're eating it maybe not the best

(1:57:37) time to go over and say oh hey by the way that's what that's a sin what you're doing right now probably not the best

(1:57:42) time right so he's saying okay now we have the intentionality portion here

(1:57:47) isn't that what you're saying yeah I I think in 14 he's talking but he also says too like if if eating meat causes

(1:57:53) another one to sin I I will never eat meat again and so he actually sacrifices his personal Liberty yeah so if he's in

(1:57:58) vegan if he's in vegan land preaching to the vegans right he's not going to come in and eat a bunch of meat and risk

(1:58:04) offense in this context because they'll never hear his word these people are hearing my what what the words are that

(1:58:09) I'm saying yeah I'm not risking offense by even engaging in discourse in this way so I I don't I don't even really see

(1:58:15) how they're comparable but um yeah I'm I'm good there if you want to move it to the next one okay really quick I'm going

(1:58:22) to read this super chat from pelagic pelagic says thank you for the Super Chat man I Know Thy works that thou art

(1:58:29) neither cold nor hot I would thou we cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will

() 

(1:58:36) spew thee out of my mouth Revelation 31516 yes I just I just want to be really clear and maybe the uh the

(1:58:42) Christians in the audience will laugh hysterically at me but I've read Revelation now multiple times and I don't I still don't understand a word of

(1:58:49) it so makes two of us um literally just don't understand hardly any of it and anybody that you go to to get it kind of

(1:58:56) clarified says well nobody really understands very much of it cuz you're not really supposed to understand too

(1:59:01) much of it so I appreciate the quote but I'm just being completely honest right multiple times I still don't really

(1:59:08) understand it very well Andrew you asked him a question and you needed a little

(1:59:13) more time to think about it uh it was a question about wives I think listening to their yeah would the would America be

(1:59:19) better if more wives listen to their husbands can I can I opt out of this

(1:59:24) one I mean you if you don't know the answer that's fine you just say I don't

(1:59:30) know the answer but I would ask you to give me like your intu your intuitive

(1:59:35) answer the thing that you would just kind of int it off the cuff and I won't hold you to it yeah that's fair so

(1:59:41) generally my thought process behind all of this is that I do think biblical submission is what would generally fix

(1:59:48) most marriage problems the problem is I think commanding submission because because of submission and just I have

(1:59:53) the authority I have the authority is wrong I think all submission should come out of a place of love knowing the person is actually laying down their

() 

(2:00:00) life for you in an effort to grow you and allow you to flourish and you obeying them actually is a mutually

(2:00:05) synergistic combination yes but I don't think that the dispute is around whether

(2:00:11) or not when you say Synergy that a man and his wife are supposed to work well together no nobody's disputing that it's

(2:00:18) the operation of how they work well together that we're that is in here okay so the question is if more wives obeyed

(2:00:27) their husbands right instead of second guessing and questioning every single justification they have for why they

(2:00:32) want a thing done yeah do you think that this country would be better or worse generally speaking I think I could say

(2:00:38) yes it would be better yeah yeah I agree and so that's what I push towards is the actual idea of what submission really is

(2:00:46) through the logic of trying to bring people through point A to point B what is actually rational here yeah but I

(2:00:51) think as men speaking to other men we actually need to call men to a higher standard to lay down their life like

(2:00:57) Christ and then you won't have to command the wife to submit because she will already submit because of the

(2:01:02) respect she has for her husband yeah but this is this creating a dualistic standard and now you've ruined this

(2:01:07) energy so when you're talking about a Synergy between a husband and a wife Your Role Your Role yeah this is the two

(2:01:13) and and if we combine these two roles roles now we have Synergy right but the

(2:01:18) second Authority is questioned this role role is now not in its role and this

(2:01:24) role still is yes so for you to say okay wait wait right your Authority has to

(2:01:30) First be oh I don't know she has to um you know feel a certain way or she has

(2:01:37) to be kind of brought to it a certain way or this type of thing if you're married in a Christian relationship this

(2:01:43) is part of your vow taking okay you're already there yeah by her not holding up

(2:01:48) her end that whole obeyence thing she's already destroying the Synergy yes you cannot strip a man of his authority and

(2:01:55) then say how dare you not lead me I think I can agree with your statement and say yes in a Biblical marriage context it would be much better if wives

(2:02:02) submitted to their husbands yeah obeyed obeyed yeah obeyed Yeah Yeah final

(2:02:08) question uh Andrew this has come up on previous shows perhaps we maybe touched on it a little bit tonight I don't know

(2:02:15) if you recall there was this uh woman who uh told a story about uh a female

(2:02:20) jiujitsu practice ition broke two legs two legs of a a male as

(2:02:27) salance um but speaking with her I think oh living underscore donated

(2:02:34) $100 I've never seen Andrew this chill I'm claiming big old Brian gave him a

(2:02:40) tranquilizer substance I agree with Luke that shaming I've been shaming Brian on W nor

(2:02:47) of the year no results frown true I've been I I'm probably the number one target for for fat shaming and body

(2:02:53) shaming online um but uh thank you living appreciate it and I did give

(2:02:58) Andrew some horse tr I've been dropping weight so there's that yeah uh so this this woman she I've heard this from some

(2:03:06) atheists agnostics Christians uh that Christians it's it's unchristian-like to

(2:03:13) judge Christians don't judge uh I'm trying to think the specifics of how

(2:03:18) they frame it but uh I don't know if you recall her spe specifically saying it's it's wrong to to make these sorts of

() 

(2:03:25) judgments um Luke do you think it's the case that Christians should not

(2:03:30) judge sry there should have been a period there but uh just in general um I

(2:03:35) think we should default judgment the Lord says vengeance is mine I think ultimately we can only judge the outward actions and he can only judge the heart

(2:03:42) but I think we can't operate on the fact if we know how he works on our hearts and we can reach out to others in the same way that he has reached out to us

(2:03:49) uh I would read in 1 Corinthians I believe uh that he says judge nothing before the time until the Lord comes who will bring

(2:03:55) both to light the hidden things of the darkness and reveal the counsels of the heart so that would be my scripture to back that up of I've open to being

(2:04:02) open-minded obviously I know Jesus uh commands that you should judge he says judge not unless you judge uh others and

(2:04:08) then he says that the same measure used to Jud judge others will be be used to judge yours yes and I think there's a difference between Jesus made Jesus made

(2:04:14) judgments daily yeah yeah go ahead and but obviously Jesus was God incarnate and we're operating under his authority and I think he will give us conviction

(2:04:20) and we will be able to make make a righteous judgment to discern but I think the Judgment of value being able to say listen Christian not Christian

(2:04:27) and you take a stand and you step up and I think you ultimately like um Paul says in Romans 2 right after the rep probates

(2:04:32) the whole thing he says like and who are you to make the Judgment because you're standing above the law and pushing down

(2:04:37) on people the law that you're literally still breaking and so I would default to say no you should not judge but then

(2:04:43) there's things like okay what's healthy for me should my daughter or son go to this school and those are judgments that

(2:04:48) you're making But ultimately it's for the benefit of the person versus the outcome of trying to judge the person

(2:04:53) and shame them how do you know if a person's a Christian you can't only the Lord knows I think you can observe their

(2:04:59) Works James 224 talks about you know faith is accompani by works and I think what if they just tell you they're not they tell you they're not a Christian

(2:05:05) then you would preach the gospel to them that's your responsibility we would assume that they're not what's up you would assume that they're not I honestly

(2:05:10) I assume a lot of people don't know the Lord and if they do it's just a healthy surprise yeah I know but if they tell you that they're not are you making a

(2:05:17) judgment that okay I'm going to believe you I'll take them at their word and I'll take them word right so in other

(2:05:23) words if people tell you what they are and who they are believe them sure right so if they tell you that they're a

(2:05:29) horrible [ __ ] monster you should probably believe them right if they tell you that they have no remorse whatsoever

() 

(2:05:34) for any of the things that they've done in fact they recommend other people do them yeah I should take them at their

(2:05:40) word sure and then C how is that you're circling back to the point that but how

(2:05:45) is that judging their soul or judging their salvation taking them at their

(2:05:51) word that they believe the things that they believe why would that be a judgment or a value assessment that you

(2:05:58) yourself wouldn't hold because I just don't feel comfortable doing it I I'm going to be honest with you I've been on both sides

(2:06:03) where you like you tell people that they aren't saved and for me personally when I do talk to people I just always Point them back to scripture and I let the

(2:06:09) Holy Spirit he says he comes to convict of sin righteousness and judgment and I do believe that the word is living and I

(2:06:15) think especially when mixed with faith when you point someone to what the standard is for what salvation is you save yourself a lot of trouble when you

(2:06:21) just trying to tell people that they are or are not saved uh first John was written you say I mean you say you don't feel comfortable with it but why

(2:06:27) wouldn't you take them at their word that's what I don't get because I think that's only what their words are

(2:06:33) saying and I think the intentions of the heart are different yeah but you have no way to assess that other than with their

(2:06:39) words and most of the time with their words wouldn't your value judgment be correct if somebody tells you for

(2:06:45) instance I went out and did all these crimes right um wouldn't wouldn't your

(2:06:50) value judgment of believing that they did probably steer you the right way into solving crimes right like wouldn't

(2:06:56) it yeah yeah it would I I I think we're talking about we're confusing General judgment with salvific judgment well

(2:07:03) okay if somebody tells you they're not saved yeah how are we confusing anything yeah then you would probably agree with

(2:07:08) them and you say you know what listen you're confessing that your heart you're You' revealed the fact that your heart is far from the word and now we're going

(2:07:14) to work to reconcile that that's what I'm saying is that you shouldn't I'm not saying that you should judge a person's

(2:07:19) salvation I'm just saying the only only means for which you would have to make these assessments is the words they're communicating is the words and the

(2:07:25) things that they do yeah so obviously if a woman is literally telling you okay

(2:07:32) last night I was engaged in a multitude fiveman gang bang okay or I went up to

(2:07:38) Australia and [ __ ] 500 virgin men right do you think that maybe it's okay

(2:07:45) for me to make the claim uh maybe your idea of what Christian is yeah is not

(2:07:52) what Christian is don't you think that that's a totally fair assessment I think it's a fair assessment do you have weak

(2:07:57) moments in your faith not where I go [ __ ] 500 virgins no okay no I'll just say that I've largely reaped a lot of

(2:08:04) negative fruit from making those quality and value judgments on people and it's usually I mean Christ says like the people that have forgiven much will love

(2:08:10) him the most sure and so I think with those people but how do you forgive people don't want forgiveness how does he forgive people who don't want

(2:08:17) forgiveness he doesn't he doesn't you present the kindness of the word he says no if he if you don't come to me right

(2:08:23) and Proclaim that I am the way the truth and light there is no forgiveness for you you have to request it so somebody's

(2:08:28) unrepentant like this Australian chck I remember who was here who said that she went and took like 300 or 500 men's

(2:08:34) virginity over a weekend MH you believe what you want and I'll believe what I want yeah you're really telling me you

(2:08:41) think it's inappropriate to make the value assessment at that point you are not a Christian and you should not say

(2:08:47) that you are cuz you're not I think I wouldn't want to make that value value judgment I would want to stand on

(2:08:53) what the word says and I would say the word tells you that that that that wouldn't be a Christian that's why you have all that criteria there they're not

(2:08:58) walking according to the scripture and so yeah my inclination would be this person probably does not have the Holy Spirit convicting them of sin this

(2:09:05) person has not come to Christ they actually haven't repented of their sin in the first place but I don't want to stand there what would it take like if

(2:09:11) they were on a stage like just slicing up a live baby in front of you and saying I love Jesus though like would

(2:09:18) that be enough yeah that would be enough I would say you need to stop right you need to stop because know that and and

(2:09:24) you would say they weren't a Christian right wait I just want to make sure they're slicing up a live baby you can

(2:09:32) say at that point you're not a Christian so and this is where I think we disagree on a lot of the things I'm coming from a

(2:09:37) place of personal conviction based off of anecdotes I've seen of people that have made those value judgments about close friends and other people based on

(2:09:44) their actions in a moment of weakness you think that it would be a moment of weakness that they were up there slicing up a baby in front of

(2:09:51) people yeah I think I think generally speaking Yeah slicing up a baby probably not

(2:09:56) someone who's operating under the conviction and power of the Holy Spirit and they're not born again and if they were up there if they were up there

(2:10:01) saying I'm a Christian would you correct it yeah I would step up and say listen this is what the word says I would not say oh listen like you know I I'm now

(2:10:09) going to decide your Eternal fate based on one action you should you should condemn that you're instructed to condemn it you're instructed to say

(2:10:14) you're not a Christian this is not Christianity this is all wrong they're slicing up a live baby totally immoral

(2:10:19) we're called to stand up and also there's usually a lot of women that actually have abortions do realize the

(2:10:25) depth of their sin and they come to Christ following that when the Catholic church was burning witches who were giving out abortions were they

(2:10:33) wrong I think that's out of my scope why I would need more details was it moral or immoral did they were they given them

(2:10:39) a chance to repent no well this was now a crime you gave an abortion that's it

(2:10:46) yeah death penalty I mean they're going eye for eye on that yeah was it eye for an ey I mean they're killing someone else get killed themselves right yeah is

() 

(2:10:53) is that or is it you're such a greater threat to society that we can't let you get back out and kill other people I'm

(2:10:58) still I'm still reading scripture I have friends that are uh you know anti-de penalty Pro death penalty I think Christ commands are along the lines of you know

(2:11:05) love your enemies pray for those that persecute you and I think usually historically every time the church takes the sword usually doesn't paint well for

(2:11:11) them well I don't know St Olga St Olga went and you know took out an entire um well people they took out really an

(2:11:18) entire people in a massive Town killed all for the sake of Revenge Saint

(2:11:24) interesting well who declares him a saint well the church the church declares him a saint of course yeah yeah

(2:11:31) Saint Saint Olga look her up by the way Saints have killed more people than you could ever imagine and done it for all

(2:11:37) sorts of really really sound reasons so it's like idea of hippie Jesus [ __ ]

(2:11:43) Jesus [ __ ] Christianity this is like a new kind of idea which comes from a

(2:11:48) feminized arm of humanity and I don't I I literally see it as part of gynocentrism yeah uh because when I look

(2:11:55) at church history here's what I see I see things like the best way to deal with a heretic is a sword through his

(2:12:01) gut I see St Olga I see like I see this over and over and over and over where

(2:12:06) it's like look uh there is a time even for the push back right there is a time

(2:12:13) even for us to hit back and in order to do that we would have to identify who is or who is not the thing yeah so that's

(2:12:20) all I'm saying that's fair uh I would like to learn more about that obviously I'll be writing down and researching St L yeah DM my wife uh Rachel she'll give

(2:12:28) you tons and tons do you have scripture too on death penalty and okay yeah fantastic the Orthodox view well the

(2:12:34) Orthodox View and the Catholic view on the death penalty is mixed I I'm not I'm

(2:12:39) not for the death penalty by the way me personally I'm not so so it's like the one Progressive view maybe I

(2:12:47) hold we got a chat here from Sean $100 Super Chat really appreciate it Sean

(2:12:52) won't let me send in a TTS I don't know why but seems like this guy is mad because his girl couldn't hold her

(2:12:58) worldview just seen a little of this debate but what Andrew is saying is the truth and it looks like you maybe wanted

(2:13:04) to come in on something not related to the yeah go ahead um I mean in

(2:13:10) responding to that no I don't think yeah sure maybe part of me is mad that uh I think she did hold her worldview pretty

(2:13:15) well but I think it was a conviction of the conscience and U I think I stand behind her conviction yeah that was the

(2:13:20) chick sitting next to you right yeah yeah she was a nice chick I didn't have any issues with her she I think the only

(2:13:25) thing we Tangled on was the Bowing yeah I think that was it which is pretty milk toast conversation to begin with really

(2:13:33) that triggered you bad enough to send all that in it wasn't even that bad that was I don't think it was that it was the

(2:13:38) treatment of Nick colet and and largely I mean if you want me to come fully clean exactly why I'm here cuz I feel

(2:13:43) like this is a platform and an opportunity to preach the gospel to a generation that's lost and been sold a FAL bill of goods on what love is and

(2:13:49) what Christ is yeah I mean great that's fine so you are using so you are using

() 

(2:13:56) this platform taking advantage taking advantage for your own gain not my own gain right because you believe that

(2:14:04) doing a cost benefit analysis right that the benefit of this is worth the cost yeah that's the same exact argument that

(2:14:11) that I just used against you same exact argument he just used against you same exact argument everybody would use

(2:14:16) against you yes I'm here because I do the same thing the cost benefit analysis destroying your worldviews you [ __ ]

(2:14:22) feminists you crazies you lunatics the cost of doing that is great but the benefit of it is way better yeah I I

(2:14:30) think the highest gain and the highest goal you could achieve is preaching the gospel and laying down your life in service for others from a place of Love

(2:14:37) yeah but I'm going to take you back to your own view on Paul when you said uh that Paul says okay in this case we do

(2:14:44) not want to offend the conscience meaning from from your view from the way that you explain this to me that you

(2:14:50) think he means why you're in the engagement of sin you actually will offend their conscience by reading them the gospel at that time so yeah that's

(2:14:57) what you're saying there man I don't remember saying well then why can't they eat the meat why not go to them with the

(2:15:03) sin while they're eating the meat why because Paul's saying he doesn't want to offend their cons right that's it right

(2:15:09) because Paul's saying you don't want to offend their conscience so don't come to them with what the word is while you're engaging in this don't suggest or invite

(2:15:16) them to right so this is your own worldview here yeah right it's just not being consistently applied you know who

(2:15:22) is consistently applying it me because I'm not doing the exact same thing that you just said you shouldn't do which is

(2:15:29) while we're in the middle of engaging in this argument right the worst time in the world at least according to you

(2:15:36) would be right then to pull out that pip it I think it depends on how you go about it I agree context is key there

(2:15:42) could be times right but that wasn't it at least not from my view okay all right

(2:15:49) couple things here before we wrap up we will roast session what do you think Andrew of course 10minute roast session

(2:20:07) guys like closing statements or sure sure yeah you you can go ahead and then we'll let the messages come this is a

() 

(2:20:12) quick question before the closing statement I asked this I'm not trying to judge a in love have you felt conviction about cussing or course joking or

(2:20:18) filthiness in your speech so just so you know here's my view on this um

(2:20:26) intentionality is the borrower of the offense so if a guy snubs his toe and he

(2:20:32) says oh [ __ ] this does not give offense in my view yeah to God what gives

(2:20:38) offense uh in what is foul or evil language is based around the intentionality of that language so if

(2:20:45) you say like what the [ __ ] are you talking about to your best friend right M who are you offending

(2:20:51) here like who who where where is the offense right I I read Matthew 12:36

(2:20:58) where he says that you will give an account for every Idol word you utter and that made me realize that there are words that are insinuating things that I

(2:21:04) know the Lord does not approve of yeah but no that's not what it's saying okay if you're if you're giving an account for every Idol word you say then give

(2:21:11) the account okay but what if the account has no offense do you want to stand before the word and say that insinuating

(2:21:17) marriage and by your speech what is an Idle Word it's an Idle Word that you're uttering

(2:21:22) without thinking about it yeah so that's you know what I do all the time yeah okay I walk around my house all the time

(2:21:28) muttering to myself are those Idle Words I don't know you don't know yeah I don't well then how do we if we have no

(2:21:35) standard to which to use uh here to to kind of make these assessments on what

(2:21:41) we should be doing then I don't even know how to respond to that like what is an idol word I mostly just asked about

(2:21:47) your conviction I was curious I don't think I don't think it to reason to say that if a man snubs his toe and says oh

(2:21:54) [ __ ] um that this is this is giving offense to the Lord for instance if somebody else let's say an immigrant got

(2:22:00) here here's my demonstration to you got here and had no idea what [ __ ] meant yeah but he heard a guy say hand me that

(2:22:05) [ __ ] yeah so he goes over to somebody and he says he says to him in broken English hand me that [ __ ] yeah do you

(2:22:12) think that that's different do I think that that's different I know cuz I don't think he knows what the word means so the intentionality maybe but I think you

(2:22:19) know what the words mean yeah I know but what about the intentionality like [ __ ] only means what you want [ __ ] to mean

(2:22:25) same thing with like um uh here let me give you an example pack up that [ __ ] right move that [ __ ] right this [ __ ]

(2:22:32) sucks there's like a million and one different uses for this word that has nothing to do with human excrement zero

(2:22:39) so it's like yeah I I don't think I've never really had a very convincing argument on this okay from from any side

(2:22:47) uh should do I think that if you're representative of the church for instance right probably not a good idea

(2:22:55) um but I am most certainly not that why is it not a because I think that through

(2:23:00) the cultural taboo of the usage of certain words and language that you can

(2:23:05) draw people away uh from the church but that doesn't mean that you're actually doing anything wrong or risking off the

(2:23:11) impact is even greater than the intent even if the priest didn't mean it the impact I'm only saying it's it it goes

(2:23:17) to the the idea of everything could be that way so it's it's I mean it's possible that

(2:23:24) yes that would do that impct is greater than the intent it could be okay do you think but that's everything just so you

(2:23:29) know that's everything I can think of do you think yourself do you view yourself you know you you've subscribed to

(2:23:35) Eastern Orthodoxy as a representative I am not a representative of the Eastern Orthodox Church no not at all do you

(2:23:41) think yourself as a representative of Christ uh again this is kind of loaded yeah

(2:23:47) sure sure sure I'm just curious for I guess in like the best way that

(2:23:52) I the best way that I can to understand what you mean by that then I would just concede yes right but I also think like

(2:24:01) what about this like just kind of turn this around a little bit I'm if I'm on a construction yard right and I go in and

(2:24:08) I like have a little mouse voice and I'm all prim and proper and I'm like well now listen gentlemen uh you really

(2:24:14) shouldn't people and instead I come in and I kind of talk like they do and I'm a little Gruff like they are and this

(2:24:19) and that wouldn't they actually respond better to what end I mean what would to

(2:24:25) the end of moving them towards the Gospel of Jesus Christ sure all things all people yeah so like so this is a

(2:24:30) double-edged s that's both ways but not short of sin and I think as Christians are called to be holy and set aside uh

(2:24:36) those that call upon the name of the Lord are supposed to depart from iniquity and we're also supposed to be above approach what is so what is aen of

(2:24:42) vipers what I mean is that a swear I don't think so I don't know the context of what is a swear calling a person a

(2:24:49) Viper and condemning to hell is that swearing at him I will say general principles extracted from James he says

(2:24:54) that if you cannot control your tongue your religion is worthless yeah that's true but that's he's not talking about cuss cuss words he in three he starts

(2:25:01) talking about what's true and what's untrue and then but these AR these aren't references to cuss words these are references uh to the the idea of

(2:25:08) what's defensible from my personal reading in Ephesians 5 he talks about the things that you don't want to be speaking of and not even be named among

(2:25:15) you and the reason why is cu they're insinuating things that the world would normally just consider base and things that I I think Christians can easily ask

(2:25:22) the Lord for help and self-control in and be you know above reproach yeah but again you acknowled back to my greater

(2:25:28) good to be a greater representation of Christ and the church when you do clean up your speech based off of the perceived impact you also agreed that

(2:25:35) that's true with literally everything on planet Earth okay why aren't you in a suit right now uh personal conv but

(2:25:42) wouldn't don't you think that that would be the most bestest way that you could possibly convict the most people you have a greater impact I don't think a

(2:25:49) suit about that lot of people aren going like that stash don't you think that you should do a of

(2:25:54) research to deter whether or not you should shave that stash you go on a like this because I don't think my shirt and

(2:26:00) my suit insinuate the base things that Ephesians 5 is talking about like and I don't think saying the word [ __ ] when

(2:26:05) you snub your toe is either so well uh why don't we do this

(2:26:10) before I was we didn't really even get to closing statements why we let some chats through

(2:29:02) best of them in the world and one but okay you keep on with your delusions bro

(2:29:08) Destiny Destiny Matt Dilla Hunty the best of the best of the best that you guys have all of them I've taken them

(2:29:27) respect much respect for that yeah thank you truff for the Super Chat Spyro flops Canadian 20 Luke when Jesus drove out

(2:29:33) the tax collectors with literally whips who do you think there who do do oh do you think there was an element of Shame

(2:29:39) there might he have possibly used offensive language or swearing at the time while very angry and then we have

(2:29:46) oh do you want to respond really quick go ahead okay uh Sean Crucible sorry auto spell but I support you both H the

(2:29:53) memes destroyed oh I I mean I knew that's what he was trying to say but The Crucible The Crucible The Crucible it's

(2:30:00) the uh alphabet version of The Crucible to address the shame question yeah go ahead yeah no uh good question obviously

(2:30:08) I think the character of Christ especially when he does20 after this one Andre I saw you

(2:30:14) shaking your head at me calling you a role model don't be so humble you may have flaws but you're very close to the

(2:30:22) ideal man for a thriving Society my flaws are overwhelming bro honestly

(2:30:28) overwhelming model yourself after like any man in the world um who has

(2:30:34) accomplished kind of these great feats you know what I mean I am I'm not that I'm just some guy who argues on the

(2:30:40) internet that's it follow Christ you wanted to respond to one of the uh yeah no no definitely as when it comes to the

(2:30:46) Judgment uh and the shame that Christ was using when he was driving the tax out you know I think we're obviously

(2:30:51) given a narrative account I don't think we can give the full insight to what he was doing and how he was saying the things uh but I do think it's important

(2:30:57) to with the definition of shame I realize that with the loaded terms obviously can mean different things I think shame pushes people down a road of

(2:31:04) saying you have to fix yourself and I think genuine a called to repentance maybe there is some shame involved but

(2:31:09) it's the action item of listen you are wrong here is the confrontation and the path to being correct and before you

(2:31:15) jump in I'm actually just going to agree and split the difference what if we just split the difference yeah there we go what if we just say it can lead to bad

(2:31:24) yeah and it can also lead to good that both tactics can work and do work sure

(2:31:30) can we just agree to that that'sit and if we can agree to that I'll just concede that that's true okay I I would

(2:31:36) take that yeah okay all right why don't why don't we get closing statements from both of you then we'll let the last few

(2:31:43) remaining chats come in so uh I think we do closing statement for you first right

(2:31:48) since he went first ini he went first he can close last the last word yeah so

() 

(2:31:54) uh first Luke thanks for coming in me yeah it really was and um I really

(2:32:01) enjoyed kind of the spirited back and forth as I told you before I don't hold any grudges I think that conversations

(2:32:07) like this are necessary um I will say that some of the criticisms I think came from a a place

(2:32:13) of serious emotion without with a lack of information right it's really easy

(2:32:19) when you're looking through the prism of a screen to make tons of assumptions especially about the people who are

(2:32:24) behind it until you kind of have more knowledge or you get to even meet the people or things like this there are

(2:32:31) conspiracy theories about me abound everywhere right and Brian too and anybody who's a prominent internet

(2:32:36) personality there's all sorts of wild [ __ ] that's out there and like 99% of it

(2:32:42) is completely false for almost all of these different personalities I think that the criticisms which were the

(2:32:48) weakest that you had were like the substance abuse was a really bad one uh the idea of social trafficking was

(2:32:55) really untenable there um especially when we got into it and you basically conceded look if it's if they're here of

(2:33:01) their own free will and you're there of your own free will the criticism both way kind of negates itself um I think that you made some

(2:33:08) pretty good points when it came to shame but ultimately ended up kind of agreeing

(2:33:13) on the spanking argument and then I think ultimately the two of us can just agree that the outcome either way could

(2:33:19) be good or bad but that both are legitimate tactics when it comes to either a preaching the gospel or arguing

(2:33:26) either either either direction right um so ultimately I'm actually going to end this with some buildups right uh tell

(2:33:33) you all the things that I think he did really good at okay you did pull off the mustache barely okay barely but um but

(2:33:42) he did he did kind of pull off the mustache here right he did pull off the mustache he came in super prepared I see

(2:33:48) all the little sticky notes in the Bible and she saw you out front writing right just like prepping for this debate that

(2:33:56) I have a lot of appreciation for right so many times I get in debates with people do no prep no nothing they just think this is the easiest thing in the

(2:34:02) world to do you know etc etc uh I also appreciated the kind of cost benefit

(2:34:08) analysis that you did where you said my conviction is worth more than the blowback that's why any of us who are in

(2:34:14) this field who believe in what we're doing do it right so my hat's kind of off to you for all of those things I

(2:34:21) thought your arguments weren't great and you had to retract a bunch of them as well you deserve one of them I wasn't

(2:34:26) charitable to but for the rest of it kind of my proverbial hats off to you appreciate it go ahead with yours yeah

(2:34:34) thank you for arriving in person thank you for pointing me uh back to the word in areas where I was uh definitely still

(2:34:40) under underere experienced and looking for more insight and providing wisdom that has been from the church and obviously ideally my entire life is

(2:34:46) dedicated to serving Christ and what he looked like and what he acted like here on this Earth and I would hope to model

(2:34:52) that in my character and obviously some of that is influenced by my anecdotes and the people I've interacted with and

(2:34:57) my own personal testimony and obviously some of that will have to come in alignment with the truth but I do believe too when it comes to if you talk

(2:35:03) to people that were saved in the book of Acts they all had a different story of how they came to repentance in Christ it obviously was all submitted under the

(2:35:09) total truth of who he was but the way that he worked to produce repentance in people's lives differed according to

(2:35:15) their story and some people already acknowledged it when they came in and some people like I said he had to afflict the comfortable

(2:35:20) and so and then yeah like I haven't been personally led to use shame yet but I I'll look into the word I'll look into the understanding and understanding the

(2:35:26) gospel too like yeah it should produce Godly sorrow should produce an understanding that your identity is wrapped up in your action but at the

(2:35:32) same time too it should be pointing like we agreed pointing to an action versus just turning to a corner and you know

(2:35:37) dunking on yourself over and over again because you keep giving into the action um James says humble yourself in the

(2:35:42) sight of the word and he will exalt you and so my my last thing I want to ask if we can just do one challenge for for you

(2:35:50) would you be willing to go to one Divine Liturgy in an orthodox church just one sure one yeah okay sure you know that

(2:35:56) there's a great one right here in Santa Barbara I've heard yeah it's really good yeah really good so you promise one sure

(2:36:03) okay all right we have a couple super chats and a couple messages to allow to come through we have Alex you and your

(2:36:09) husband have a good night Andrew Wilson thank you Alex appreciate it we that was a reference to a debate not to you we

(2:36:16) have John get it of the cult Fe feminism the secret of women's Liberation by

(2:36:21) Andrew's wife Rachel Wilson do it get the book we have Marley but as a

(2:36:32) reference to on the if you want to maybe swearing or church or possibly yeah all right thank you Marley uh Daren Murphy

(2:36:52) on it's the goose mustache from Top Gun it is yes still cool come on he this guy

(2:36:58) nailed it that is the goose mustache from gun he can we can you can we get the zoom on the goose I don't know if we

(2:37:06) can right at the camera this ladies and gentlemen is the goose mustache it's

(2:37:11) true material what was like a quote from that movie that goose said uh what was it Turn and Burn was it

(2:37:17) was he Turn and Burn what was what was his uh I don't remember he just died

(2:37:30) through guys just a reminder TTS is $20 if you want to get last one in and then we're going to wrap the show thank you

(2:37:36) guys keep kicking ass I'm assuming it's ass boys feminism sucks long live the patriarchy soy boy porn stash is

(2:37:44) weak do you want to respond to no okay all right thank you for the message uh I

(2:37:49) applaud them for coming on the show questions donated $20 genuine question

(2:37:55) from my own conviction how does smoking not violate First Corinthians 3:17 how

(2:38:01) is eating a donut night oh just really quick before I have you guys jump in just and also to the last TTS he said

(2:38:06) he's weak I mean I actually want to really applaud you for coming in and having this discussion we have a lot of

(2:38:12) people who will DM us often with much more aggressive or insulting or negative

(2:38:18) uh you know actually posted on our Discord we had in the hate mail section

(2:38:23) discord.gg whatever we had this woman say that she was going uh personally attacked me personally attacked Andrew

(2:38:29) she said that she wanted to come on and uh destroy she would absolutely destroy

(2:38:34) us and that we would be too [ __ ] to have a conversation with this woman I even offer to I offer to fly this woman

(2:38:41) out at my expense to come on the show and then she ends up blocking us totally

(2:38:47) Ducks so credit to you because most people who DM us and say I'd love to

(2:38:52) have this conversation and and you did so actually you know even though I disagreed with some of your assertions you did so relatively politely yeah and

(2:38:59) and also um I think I think respect is always given to people have

(2:39:06) criticisms but take those criticisms directly to those who they're criticizing so that that person can give

(2:39:13) an account and defense for themselves and that I have a lot of respect for because it's rare now really quickly the

(2:39:20) smoking thing can we yeah I just said how how does it not apply to eating a jelly donut it's the same

(2:39:27) application I would comment on that not being given to things Paul says that all things are edifying but or all things are permissible but not all things are

(2:39:33) non donated $20 thank you n Destiny he's some lip [ __ ] leftist if you think he's

(2:39:39) the best you're sely mistaken still seen you argue one person who would be above

(2:39:44) room temperature IQ including today we should do it debate Sam Harris I'm happy to do let's do it do you have you ever

(2:39:52) spoken with Sam Harris no but I'm sure we could get him on whatever let's do it yeah and also really quick on that uh

(2:39:59) We've I think we've put out an open challenge to any feminists any atheists

(2:40:06) who want to come on and debate Andrew uh if you want to come on and debate Andrew

(2:40:12) in this sort of similar format we'll host it we'll try to make make it work

(2:40:17) we're flexible schedule wise so but a lot of people even with these open invitations they don't take it up well

(2:40:23) the thing is is we would like to keep it around still the ideas and the themes that are talked about on the show and so

(2:40:31) the one thing I I never wanted to do was insert too much uh religiosity into uh

(2:40:38) whatever and the reason is is because it turns a lot of people away from moving into what the content is about and so

(2:40:44) it's slipped in where it's slipped in and uh and I think that that's good um

(2:40:49) though I wouldn't be opposed to having some religious debates I'm I'm okay with that I think it's still better to keep

(2:40:55) things around kind of normative politics feminisms you know things like that uh

(2:41:00) rather than kind of making too much of a primary around religious debates that's not really the format for this Channel

(2:41:06) The Crucible on the other hand might be a better place for those I would keep this kind of in the realm if you're a

(2:41:12) feminist you're an egalitarian you want to do political debates I'm happy to do those kind of bogging the channel down

(2:41:19) with the um with kind of the open religious stuff I think would not be good for whatever ultimately okay all right um let's see

(2:41:28) we'll let the last ones come through Mecha Wing Zero donated $20 what is this guy's explanation of

(2:41:35) First Peter 31 this verse does not support the idea that husbands have to earn submission for their wives uh quick

(2:41:42) response on read it hang on read it out loud read out wives likewise be submissive to your own husbands that even if some do not obey the word they

(2:41:49) without out a word may be won by the conduct of their wives when they observe your chased conduct accompanied by fear do

(2:41:55) not let your adornment be merely outwards arranging the hair and jewelry so that means even if he's telling you to do [ __ ] you don't want to do by doing

(2:42:02) it you're able to convince him better to stay within the confines of what the Lord is commanding and I think that's in

(2:42:08) First Corinthians as well too yeah no good point uh I definitely was not thinking of that scripture when I was

(2:42:14) coming here with my opinion and I was mostly coming from an anecdotal conviction uh for my girlfriend so I am

(2:42:19) emotionally implicated in that as well I will recognize but I will say that Anthony Edwards isn't dead sorry I'm

(2:47:49) shred face Andrew what do you think of husbands that push their wives to the brink of suicide with verbal and manipulative abuse yeah so what you're

(2:47:56) looking at there is the same idea that we agreed upon which is that this does not comport with reason in our standard

(2:48:01) for what reason is is sin uh coming from the uh idea of the LOI and the nature of

(2:48:09) God in Jesus Christ the Holy Trinity so uh no that would be bad right that would

(2:48:14) be bad to push your wife to the brink of suicide verbal manipulative abuse that would be bad nobody would ever disagree

(2:48:20) that that was bad that's not even we weren't even in that that Universe of talking about that so and then last

(2:50:07) going from that one that was a brutal slugfest debate too so that's for those of you who haven't seen it go watch it

(2:50:13) it was good say so NZ donated $20 would love to see Andrew debate

(2:50:19) someone intelligent I don't know if he is a good debator or not because honestly I have never seen him debate

(2:50:25) someone intelligent and have watched every single one well who the [ __ ] are all these intelligent people how are the

(2:50:30) best left-wing Debaters not intelligent just like it's just like nobody Andrew debates is intelligent which either

(2:50:36) tells me that maybe people are way stupider than than I thought or I'm way smarter than I think I don't know it's

(2:50:43) like also like this this are you familiar with the term Pub stomp mm you've never heard Pub stomping so Pub

(2:50:50) stomping is like in a video game term where you know how they'll be matchmaking where as you like kind of uh

(2:50:57) rank up in the game it'll start uh matching you with people of similar skill yeah so what a pub stomp would be

(2:51:04) is like you essentially recreate your account you still have the same skill but you're going to get matched with

(2:51:10) newbies and you just go in there and Stomp Them Pub stomp so we have an open

(2:51:16) invitation we've posted on Twitter we've posted in stream of if you're competent you want to come

(2:51:21) on and debate we'll have you it's not like in fact the debates where the your

(2:51:26) opponents give you push back are better so it's not like we just want to Pub stomp people it's just we find people

(2:51:35) perhaps hesitant to come on and debate Andrew because of his uh he's going to

(2:51:42) spank him anyways I don't I don't know no you can find debates with some of the most prolific of the at least internet

(2:51:48) person and I'm aware of right on The Crucible video and uh we have had great

(2:51:53) debates on whatever and by the way I just want to point this out that some of what you consider to be the like smarter

(2:51:59) smarter leftist Debaters many times the kind of like polyi graduate uh

(2:52:05) psychology graduate uh only fans girls often they give better debates than some

(2:52:11) of these kind of like prolific personalities so make of that what you will

(2:52:16) H and uh I'm trying to think what was the other thing here uh oh I'll just

(2:52:22) read the chat no I fixed it from all the Spells so bricks and just lose weight okay thank you man working on it it's in

(2:52:28) the works we have uh silent zero please bring Jim Bob and Andrew on a 2v2 on

(2:52:34) Evolution yeah that would be a lot of fun yeah definitely down for that and Sean thank you for that uh Jim Bob said he would definitely come out to Santa

(2:52:41) Barbara to do a 2v2 I'd like did you get Parker and Dean the two of them to come down against me and jimbob be hilarious

(2:52:48) well so we have some uh we have some debates scheduled in the coming uh

(2:52:54) coming week or so M uh I'm speaking with Parker I'll talk to you after the show about about that but uh we I would like

(2:57:01) sorry go ahead go ahead I don't I didn't mean to interrupt you go ahead the the whole reason like I was saying was with Nicollet and with the other situations

(2:57:07) was presenting Christ and so um I'd be remiss if I didn't say very quickly Christ came to save Sinners of whom I am

(2:57:13) chief and most importantly the Bible says that he's pleading on our behalf actually through us be reconciled to

(2:57:19) Christ you will have to give an account for all of the actions all of the thoughts all of the intentions of the

(2:57:24) heart that you have done and short of Christ you will fall short and that's the message and that's the gospel and it will change your life because it's

(2:57:30) changed mine and Jesus is Alive and he's still saving people today all right okay cool well we're
