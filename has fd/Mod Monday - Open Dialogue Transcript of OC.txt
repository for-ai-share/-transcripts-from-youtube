Title: Mod Monday - Open Dialogue With @The_Crucible & @enemycharlie

(0:05) [Music]

(0:12) Generally, generally uh here's what actually happens. The foundation of all money. I'm really mad

(0:19) that does it make right

(0:25) stop the deregulation of the industry is

(0:31) obviously going to cause more of that industry to lubricate the trust connection

(0:36) between people until they have enough yet we could still look at biological reality and determining who's a female

(0:42) even if there are why don't you deny denounce feminism the same way they're denouncing You can't

(0:48) really if you don't something to be objective it needs to be verifiable and you can't verify

(0:54) if I make a claim it's a political pundant it is true that I definitely could be wrong

(1:00) you're promoting right ideology is the politics right this is my ideology this and so 2015 anyone go

(1:08) back and watch the footage the first GOP debate Robert

(1:15) you Heat.

(1:28) Heat.

(1:34) [Music]

(2:05) Okay. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome back. This is moderator Monday, but we are going to do

(2:10) it a little different this evening. I am Sarah, the raging tomato, bringing to you a continued conversation from last

(2:16) week's moderator Monday. I know everybody had a good time with that one. So, we're going to see if we can actually get to the crux and the the

(2:23) roots and the soul of the the debate in and of itself. And maybe there can be con some persuasion across the board. We

(2:29) shall see. Um, but it will be different. This is not technically set up as a debate. both uh both Andrew and Charlie

(2:38) are fully aware of this conversation and how it's going to be. Uh so if you can bear with it and and we can all roll

(2:43) through it just fine. Uh uh Charlie, would you like to introduce yourself?

(2:49) Hello. Uh my name is uh Charlie or Enemy Charlie. I am a Twitch streamer. My

(2:55) background is in fantasy literature. Uh I am not a professional debater. I did

(3:01) not study politics. Um, but I like to comment on it anyway and I'm happy to be

(3:06) here. Thank you for having me, Sarah. Thank you. And just a kind reminder before I hand it over to Andrew and then

(3:12) I'm going to let him take the rest of the show from here. Um, I do want to tell you that we will of course read and

(3:18) respond to your super chats at the end of uh probably around the two-hour mark and we will of course open the panel

(3:23) later. I'm going to put a little uh leverage on this conversation. We'll see where we go. And don't forget the dog

(3:30) surgery fund. We've got that going. So, Grift and Grift Continuation. Andrew, the floor is yours, sir.

(3:39) You're muted. Say something real quick. Hello.

(3:44) Okay. Sorry. I was having some audio issues on my end. Anyway, you should be all right now. So, uh, yeah. So, the

(3:51) continuation from last week. So, I watched kind of what I would consider to be a bit of a cope stream. Uh, not much

(3:56) of it from, uh, Charlie over here. I think a lot of times people um when you

(4:03) because when you're doing a debate, your goal is to uh win your view in the debate. That's the goal. And get your

(4:10) your viewpoint across and this and that. I think a lot of people think that because I'm very accurate with the

(4:15) things that I say um that there's some trickery or foot or that I'm being in

(4:20) some way evil to them or bad faith to them or something like this. So, I

(4:26) thought we would have the conversation about what it is that you actually wanted to talk about and um you know,

(4:33) no, we don't have to do semantics. We don't have to do any of that stuff. We can actually just kind of dive into

(4:38) whatever it is that you actually wanted to discuss and I'll actually answer to those whatever those criticisms are. So,

(4:45) that uh I I think I could probably either you or your partner, I didn't care which one came on or both of you. I

(4:52) think I could probably convince both of you over to my side, but I think that if

(4:58) you're people who don't have like um any any sort of philosophy background or have any sort of background when it

(5:04) comes to debate or understanding very concise definitions and why they're so important and you just want to you just

(5:10) want to discuss like just have like a general across the board. I'm like I'm fine with doing that and then maybe we can get to the heart of whatever it is

(5:16) that you're actually trying to get at. That's all. Okay. Um, out of curiosity, is that what

(5:25) motivated the um this is that you you feel like Well, I guess I I want to know

(5:32) like what motivated this um that I think I can change your mind.

(5:38) Okay. Precisely. So, the goal is to change my mind. So, are we going to be discussing um the morality? discuss. We can discuss

(5:45) whatever you want, but I think diving into what we were trying to talk cuz your big your big criticism in your

(5:52) response is that you feel like you didn't actually get to get at whatever it was you were trying to get at that

(5:57) you were caught up on semantics or something like this. So, whatever it is that you actually wanted to get at in

(6:02) that conversation, let's get at it. Okay. Um I I suppose that uh I I mean I

(6:10) think it's good and important to have like shared definitions, but because it was blood sports debate, I was uh

(6:18) pretty wary of it becoming just semantics essentially rather than

(6:24) actually getting to the I suppose the meat of the argument. Um I prepared for I guess meta ethics. Um I don't have

(6:34) you want to discuss meta ethics really. Well, yeah. I I suppose like where morality comes from because what I did

(6:41) get from the conversation was that I do not uh

(6:47) I did I did not have the um

(6:52) the the resources or the uh background to support my moral philosophy. And

(7:00) only Yeah. only if you're making a moral like Yeah. Okay. Go ahead. I'm sorry. I won't cut you off.

(7:06) Okay. Um largely it was just uh again I felt like I didn't I didn't have the

(7:11) ability to justify my um my stance and I don't while I

(7:19) still think that my worldview is correct because of course I do um I don't like

(7:25) feeling like I cannot uh adequately explain myself or defend my position. Um, so I

(7:33) did do some research, not as much as I wanted. My best friend visited this weekend, so I didn't have the time to uh

(7:40) read as much as I wanted to, unfortunately. But, um, I think I again

(7:45) I am I'm interested in uh, you know, I guess coming to a mutual understanding,

(7:52) finding common ground in some sense. Well, metaeththics is uh that's a tough

(8:00) conversation even for people who have conversations about metaeththics a lot. Uh we can go down that road if you want,

(8:07) but the entirety of that discussion is semantics-based. The the entire thing it has to be by its

(8:14) by its very nature it's semantics-based. Um I'm like I'm happy to go down go down

(8:19) meta ethics with you or metaphysics or whatever you want from a philosophical you know kind of branch but if that it

(8:28) when we had the original debate right what was it that you were trying to get at like ultimately what was your point

(8:36) about land and taking it by force like what was that what was the heart of what it was that you were trying to get at

(8:41) um I thought that we were going to be discussing colonization and now I can give some

(8:47) background in I guess my sort of training. So I have a um I have a master

(8:52) of letters in fantasy literature actually. So uh um I'm a big fan of fantasy literature.

(8:59) Cool. Okay. Talking like Dungeons and Dragons, Terry Goodkind. Tolken. Tolken is my uh bread and butter

(9:06) essentially. Okay. So Lord of the Rings. Yes. And the Civilarian and etc etc etc. I

(9:12) have a big Tolken uh row back there on my bookcase. Yes, my

(9:17) shrine. The dark the dark lord was right. Yeah. Sauron Sauron was right.

(9:23) Yeah, sure. Um well well I guess no he wouldn't have uh he failed to take

(9:29) things by force. However, um I required force to stop him. Just just

(9:34) saying. I mean, kind kind of, yes, but largely

(9:40) as a uh distraction, I think, so that, you know, Sam and Froto could sneak in.

(9:45) But yes, there there was, you know, well, that was the second that was the second War of the Rings, though. The first War of the Rings, the entire thing

(9:51) was done by force. An alliance of elves and men, right? They stood up against Sauron and they were the ones who they literally beat

(9:58) him by force as Silder cut the ring off of his finger. So, um, so yeah, it's definitely about

(10:03) was about force, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So my point wasn't not to make that um my point wasn't to say

(10:09) that the force doctrine is incorrect necessarily, but to argue that uh it is

(10:17) more productive um for for people to attempt to live in

(10:23) peace and harmony essentially because while we are all subject to the force doctrine inevitably uh you know again

(10:31) live by the sword, die by the sword. Um, I think that colonial projects have a

(10:37) tendency to to fail in the um in in the long term. Uh,

(10:45) but what do you mean when you like when we're talking about colonialism, you're talking about are you talking about empires like

(10:53) British Empire expansionism into into India? You're talking about uh the expansionism of England into what later

(11:01) became the United States? You're talking about uh Spain, you're talking about the French, you're talking about Napoleonic

(11:07) era. Is that what we mean when we're saying colonialism? I was thinking um

(11:13) the more sort of recent uh like yes like uh largely British but also I mean

(11:19) broadly European imperialism like for instance like you know throughout uh

(11:24) Asia, Africa um you know South America, the Americas as well as like the settler

(11:29) colonialism um in the United States and in Australia and South Africa. Okay. Um so

(11:35) do you thought that those were failures? I think most of them were in many ways.

(11:43) I think that they can succeed for for some time but I think that uh you know

(11:48) especially in Africa we are what we are seeing now is well I mean you know Europe lost most of its holdings in in

(11:55) Africa. Yeah. But wasn't the Ivory Coast greatly benefited by colonialism? I mean in a

(12:01) big way. Um in what capacity? Well, I mean the health, welfare, education status,

(12:07) standards, technology, everything in the Ivory Coast is better than the rest of Africa, right? Or at least the w the

(12:13) west of uh or I think is that southern Africa? Is that the region

(12:18) that I'm thinking of? Mhm. Um I mean I was thinking broadly all

(12:24) over. Um but largely yes. I was thinking mostly of like Algeria, um South Africa.

(12:29) My African history is unfortunately not terribly robust. Um,

(12:34) yeah. I I understand like in this is a really broad very broad I'm like I'm pulling [ __ ]

(12:40) from 15 years ago in my brain that I read somewhere. You know what I mean? But No, that's true. Me, too. But col but colonialism

(12:47) Mhm. it it was definitely successful. I mean, I don't I don't know how how you how it

(12:53) would even be argued it wasn't like it was pretty successful, right? Um I guess like my metrics of success would be uh

(13:01) the sort of from a settler perspective. Um

(13:06) what what are the long-term benefits? I would say that the American colonial project was successful. Um that at the

(13:14) end of the day I mean the settlers uh my ancestors are here to stay uh at great

(13:21) cost. We're all thriving, right? Like we're all thriving basically in colonialism.

(13:26) I would say I mean that's also I mean that's also a terribly interesting question to ask because I mean I I would

(13:32) argue I'm sure that we have different uh ideas of why you know um I suppose in

(13:40) the 21st century uh the the present is not looking so bright and our future is

(13:45) not looking so bright. I I'm assuming that you would take these sort of um

(13:51) uh widespread like secularism um as a as a downside.

(13:58) uh where well I would I would give it multiple components but two easy ones that I would point to would be multiculturalism

(14:05) which has been a complete and unmitigated disaster for all western nations who have implemented it and uh a

(14:12) second secondary aspect I would also give would be things like feminism progressive doctrine uh idealism of

(14:20) secularism of course uh you brought that up but uh you know secularists for instance they love John Lockach but they

(14:26) often forget that John Lock if you he said if you weren't a Christian you shouldn't be able to vote

(14:32) ever because he didn't feel like if you had any grounding ethics um why why the hell

(14:38) would he ever want you in charge of anything he considered atheists to be essentially plebs right he considered

(14:44) them to not be moral agents um so you know that's that's kind of the

(14:49) philosophy leading into it but my I think if I had to point to one if you wanted to know like what's the one thing

(14:56) easy thing Andrew would point to that would uh show why the west is uh

(15:02) completely and unmititigatedly becoming a disaster. I would point to multiculturalism.

(15:07) Okay. Um what in what respect? I mean I would I would also say that my my

(15:14) concerns are largely um I do feel that uh you know kind of unmitigated.

(15:22) This is again we're going to have to make a lot of concessions here because uh gonna hate this but my background is

(15:29) you know I I subscribe more to the um postmodernist school of thought

(15:34) so just bear with me deconstructionist. Yes. uh largely um

(15:41) uh you know I I I feel that latestage capitalism is profoundly antisocial in

(15:46) many ways uh in the way that it is like um

(15:52) [Music] a drive towards profits rather than um improving the human condition. uh as

(16:01) well as like the environmental consequences of like colonialism. Um but more so also industrialization.

(16:09) Um however that gets into the whole that that is a very complicated conversation

(16:14) that I'm not entirely sure how to resolve frankly. Um because I think that you know technological

(16:20) what's um what's the difference between latestage capitalism and early capitalism?

(16:26) um light stage. I think I would characterize it as uh

(16:32) almost kind of the the um frankly nearing the death of capitalism

(16:37) in the sense that uh we're nearing we're nearing sort of this like techno feudal stage

(16:44) technofudalism um where I just feel like monopolies are so powerful that they

(16:50) have kind of like superseded the the state in a way um and in the sense that

(16:56) like we profit uh motivation for profit outdoes

(17:01) motivation for like what I mean essentially defies logic like we produce

(17:07) far more than we need. Um well again you have um you you own Do you own

(17:13) property at all? I own a car. I don't own land.

(17:18) Yeah, land land. I mean specifically I assume that you own your microphone and you own your clothes and you own those

(17:24) things, right? ood land specific property. Okay. But you know people who do, of

(17:29) course. Yeah. Yeah. And do you know people who are in the lower middle class or even people you would consider under the income

(17:36) threshold who own some some property like poor people who own property perhaps inherited or gifted or things

(17:42) like that? Yes. Yeah. So, so that you know that used to

(17:48) be an impossibility like property ownership when you're talking about feudalism in in Europe

(17:55) especially uh what made you a noble was the fact that you had a house and houses had property right the reason that the

(18:02) uh like noble families if you look at um England for instance if you wonder why

(18:08) the royals are in such a good position is because when the king stepped down for parliament they leased all of the

(18:13) royal land to parliament Parliament has to pay duties on it. That's why they're so [ __ ] rich, right? Land holder and

(18:19) land ownership is a key to individual wealth and prosperity.

(18:24) And uh basically under only I've only ever really seen uh forms of capitalism

(18:31) which provide for people to be able to own property, which is the pathway towards actual prosperity and wealth for

(18:38) the family. I don't know any other system that's ever really allowed that to happen. Feudal systems in Japan

(18:44) really didn't allow for peasants to own property. They were owned by damios and lords and samurai. And then you had

(18:51) knights in Europe. They had their own form of feudal system. And this idea of private property ownership has has

(18:58) really consolidated I think the idea of the health and wealth of of individual

(19:03) people. And I don't know why the there's such an anti- capitalist kind of

(19:08) rhetoric and things like this, but like that's the key to everything, right? Is is owning land.

(19:14) That's the key to crossgenerational wealth. It's the key to everything. I mean, I'm I'm absolutely inclined to

(19:21) uh you know, agree in the sense that I'm I'm sure your ancestors like mine showed up here poor and you know, within like

(19:30) several generations, we went from being, you know, former European peasantry to, you know, my uh grandparents could go to

(19:37) college. That's amazing. And, you know, eventually own land, which is uh I agree it was it was absolutely like an

(19:43) equalizer. But when I think of late stage capitalism, I think um you know

(19:49) like uh reduced um opportunities for

(19:54) individuals to gain wealth essentially like monopolies is what I mean is like

(19:59) um for instance I can we used to have those worse right like land barons. So, oh yeah yeah yeah.

(20:05) We broke up land barrenies. Um but but honestly most of that stuff happens due

(20:12) to a unison of contract with governments which is what socialism kind of advocates for. Right. So

(20:18) the only time I've ever seen really powerful business monopolies has been when they have contracts with

(20:25) governments and governments give them the monopolization of because then they're giving them force

(20:31) doctrine, right? They're bas basically putting force on their end. That's the only time I've ever actually seen uh strict monopolies has been when

(20:39) they're essentially working in unison with the state, right? Oh, yeah. I mean, I would I I'm inclined

(20:45) to agree with that, but I would say that that's less uh and I suppose we could call that

(20:51) socialism, but um that would be I mean, frankly, a prioritization of uh you

(20:57) know, politicians making money from lobbyists versus prioritizing what would be the the you know, good for the

(21:04) country. For instance, like um uh kind of like like the the auto

(21:10) industry lobby. Um, like part of the reason we have such shitty public transportation is because like the auto

(21:17) industry has lobbied so, you know, strongly to to make cars the number one

(21:23) method of transportation in America. Granted, it's because we're a huge country and we do need them. I grew up in a rural area. Um, public

(21:29) transportation would not work. Why? Yeah. Why do you think that? Why do you think that um why do you think that

(21:35) the reason is because of car bids for that? Why do you actually why do you actually

(21:40) believe that that's the case? Well, to continue making money. I mean, I feel like we often uh, you know,

(21:46) choose the the like less productive um route so that uh

(21:54) specific, you know, companies and individuals can continue to to make money. It's like the way that we uh you

(22:02) know heavily subsidize certain like businesses and industries that operate on a uh a loss just so that they can

(22:10) continue to function rather than allowing them to to fail. Um but again, so like the

(22:16) Yeah, sorry. Go ahead. No, go ahead. I was going to say if you look at the United States and how it's divided,

(22:21) if you look to the east and the west, almost all the people in the United States live in those two locations. And

(22:27) then uh I think it's essentially yeah west of the Rockies right before

(22:33) you hit the the uh western coastal areas like Oregon, California, this type of thing. Almost nobody lives there. Do you

(22:41) know why that is? Um in which region? You said west of the

(22:46) Rockies. Yeah, until you hit the west coast and then you got tons of people in California, Oregon, this and that. M I

(22:53) lived in Nevada for a bit, so I would say probably uh lack of access to water and farmland.

(22:58) It's water. Yeah. Right. We build cities where there's water. Where there's industry because you need the ships to come in.

(23:04) Well, you need water. Well, you just need water to drink it. You got to have water to just drink

(23:09) and uh you need water for waste treatment. You need water for all of this type of stuff, right? Like you said, industry.

(23:15) The thing is is when you look at public transportation in the United States, we had that actually. We had massive

(23:21) railroads and they operated as public transportation. But the problem is they took five [ __ ] days to get you

(23:27) anywhere, you know, and they still do. And even if you have very speedy trains, it takes forever. You hop in your car, you're

(23:34) there in 6 hours instead of, you know, uh 60 hours. So I don't think that I while it's true,

(23:41) I think automakers are trying to make money. I also think that individuals having access to automobiles has been

(23:48) life-changing for us. So, for instance, I live an hour away from anywhere you could work. I always commuted an hour to

(23:54) work and an hour home, always. But I wanted to also not live in a major city and raise my family outside of a major

(24:01) city. I thought that that was poisonous to um, you know, to their mental health and their well-being to load them up

(24:07) inside of industrial areas. So, the fact that I had vehicles and could access those and actually drive these long

(24:14) distances, I would say, contributed greatly to the health and welfare of my own family.

(24:20) Oh, yeah. Of course. I wasn't thinking um on like a like a

(24:26) uh more rural suburban capacity. I was thinking But that's all of America, right?

(24:32) Outside the major cities. It's all rural by all and there's only there's only a

(24:38) few massive cities where everybody lives. That's what that was my point. Most people It is true. Most people

(24:43) congregate in cities, but it city infrastructure for public transportation already exists. You already have buses,

(24:49) you have trains, you have subways, you have all this stuff. Could those things be better inside of cities? Sure. But

(24:55) I'll tell you, the most convenient way I've ever gotten around in a city is with an Uber.

(25:02) That has by far been the most convenient way that I've ever gotten around inside of a city is with an Uber. Not with

(25:08) trains or buses or totally inconvenient in comparison to hopping on the app

(25:13) and saying, "Okay, pick me up here." And it's 10 bucks. You know, it's like 10 bucks. go across town. That's the most

(25:18) convenient way for me to travel in a city. Um, I would say American cities, yes, I

(25:25) did live in Glasgow for about a year and um, I would say that the the trains uh,

(25:31) other countries have much more reliable uh, public transportation

(25:39) versus the US because again, I don't think that we prioritize public transportation. Well, don't they need it? because

(25:45) European automakers essentially regulated the European auto industry out of like out of existence and the United

(25:52) States didn't. But if that wasn't the case and there was, you know, we used to have really affordable automobiles if

(25:58) you look in Europe. Um they they do have affordable automobiles, but they're basically [ __ ] right? They're like [ __ ]

(26:04) cars. They're not they're all box shaped. Uh you know, nast n like where's

(26:09) all your European F-150s? You know what I mean? Where are they all? They regulated them all out, right? So,

(26:15) and do we do we think that I mean I have beef with with the size of trucks today.

(26:21) Um they're cheaper to make like they're s like you could make them out of plastic. Do you know why they make them so big

(26:27) and out of steel? It's because it it actually doesn't cost them any more to make them with the additional steel.

(26:34) And they're actually safer that way. So like if you're going to hit a deer in a rural countryside in your F-150, you

(26:39) want it to be made out of steel, don't you? Oh, of course. But I'm talking about um like the the size of trucks today.

(26:46) They're very oversized and it is something to do with I cannot remember. I think some sort of Obama era

(26:51) regulation or something. Um where they're they're just made gigantic in a

(26:56) way that isn't necessarily like helpful for for people who actually do like

(27:02) outside manual labor and construction and farmwork. So there's like a really weirdly large market for like very old

(27:08) trucks because they're more uh ergonomic, so to speak. Um, but they're also kind of usually killing machines.

(27:15) It's because they're not electronic, right? I mean, I would say that the the Suburban uh female in the SUV is far

(27:22) more deadly than the redneck in the 50. I'm inclined to, Dude, I'm inclined to

(27:27) freaking agree. I don't think we don't need to have Yeah. What I mean is I think cars I'm just saying it seems it

(27:35) seems like the suburban soccer mom is uh something more to worry about there. I'm

(27:41) taking that one personally. Yeah. I mean, as long as you don't drive a

(27:46) giant SUV for no reason. I think it's I mean, I come from a family of like five kids and we had a relatively uh smallish

(27:54) car and we functioned just fine. Um I don't think I don't know why the the ladies will be driving around the

(28:00) Escalades for their like two kids. Well, because you the the whole point, you know, why American automobiles like

(28:05) the station wagon, things like that, why they were made so big and why SUVs are so popular? because they're family

(28:10) oriented vehicles. So, you you probably haven't experienced this because I I think I believe you said you don't have

(28:16) children, you're unmarried, right? Mhm. Okay. So, the thing is is that if you're

(28:21) married and you have kids, you're going to go on a family outing, right? What happens if you have three kids?

(28:28) You fit them in a tiny little car. Oh, well, yeah. I mean, I do come from a family of five and I'm I'm the the I

(28:35) have a lot of older brothers. So, you're going to go to a beach. You're going to bring the sunscreen. You're going to bring the towels. You're going to bring the folding chairs, right? You're going

(28:42) to bring all the [ __ ] that women need, which is a ridiculous amount of stupid garbage, and all the little toys the

(28:48) kids want, and you're going to pack them in the car seats, and you're going to put, you know what I mean? You're not going to do that [ __ ] in a tiny car. So,

(28:54) the whole thing is like, these are all tailored towards families. That's the whole point, right?

(29:00) If I can add in a thought there, somebody actually had mentioned to me too, the idea of car seats. Um because

(29:06) if you can't put two car seats next to each other, at least not very easily. Uh so then we get the Suburban with that

(29:13) uh extended back seat uh because you're especially if you have a toddler car seat and then another

(29:19) toddler or booster seat, so on and so forth. They they don't they don't work well. I can tell you that from experience, at least not side by side,

(29:27) right? But like I feel like a lot of the time, again, I come from a very large family that was very outdoorsy, so we

(29:33) did often have things. I mean, we we camped all the time. We were very outdoorsy, so we would have our bikes,

(29:38) we would have our tents, we would have our freaking um paddle boards and [ __ ] Were you strapping them on top of a

(29:44) Prius? Are you strapping No. No. My dad actually has an F-150. Of course. Yeah, exactly. That's how

(29:51) often. But like that's No, I mean that that makes sense, right? But then you'll always see oftenimes and my also my

(29:57) dad's gigantic. My dad's 6'5. Mhm. So, seeing my giant dad with his five children step out of a big F-150 with

(30:04) his paddle board and all of his camping gear, it's like, okay, right, that makes sense. But then you'll see like a a dude by

(30:11) himself in a giant car or a lady by herself in a giant SUV and it's like, well, why do you actually have this? So,

(30:19) uh, I I think that perhaps people have been a bit too, uh,

(30:25) liberal in their purchasing of of overly large vehicles when they don't actually need it. Um,

(30:32) I mean, you do you just base things on need though instead of on desire and on

(30:38) want? Like so when I look at capitalism the reason I I and I've always been a big advocate for capitalism

(30:45) um the desires of people is what drives innovation and one big desire that does

(30:50) that is a desire not to die that's a big one that human beings have and so when I look at medical technology

(30:56) and I look at um the driving innovation behind uh some of what what modern cures

(31:03) would be something akin to miraculous my wife for instance she suffered from migraines

(31:08) They actually made a miracle drug that cured those migraines, right? Is the the great advance of medical science. But

(31:15) that [ __ ] costs a lot of [ __ ] money. You know what I mean? It costs a lot of money. And I don't see any of these non-

(31:21) capitalist age nations as a driving force towards that sort of technological innovation because they don't have the

(31:29) ability to loan money. And that's the big one. The big one is the ability in capitalism to have access to capital.

(31:36) Um I would say that uh so I I I can

(31:41) uh not on a you know professional level but my my father's a doctor and my grandfather was a doctor so I can

(31:47) comment on this. My father uh my father was a uh internal medicine doctor. Um so he's like essentially

(31:54) Dr. House. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's the guy you go see. Uh and my grand called diagnosticians. He

(32:00) used to be called diagnosticians. Yeah. My grandfather's an anesthesiologist. Um

(32:06) the my my father has and mind you my dad is fairly conservative. He's a rather

(32:13) conservative man. Um he has uh he takes significant issue with with our kind of

(32:20) um you know profitbased medical industry because he thinks that we have a system

(32:26) that encourages people to remain sick and to essentially uh you know rather

(32:33) than um you know we don't we don't focus on preventative care. We focus on making

(32:38) money off of sick people versus making sure they don't get sick in the first place. and he has just kind of you know

(32:46) uh spent the last few years there's it's but it's do you know why that is because

(32:52) health insurance nope it's not it's because doctors themselves [ __ ] everybody so you may

(32:57) not know this but we the only type of medicine that we practice here is alopathic alopathic medicine nothing

(33:05) homeopathic none of that it's all alopathic and the reason for that is because all alternative forms of

(33:10) medicine were destroyed by doctors themselves who unionized under one flagship with one magazine and they said

(33:18) anything that was not alopathic medicine which would include preventative care by the way they completely and totally uh

(33:26) destroyed them. I'm trying to think of what the uh what the newspaper was that did it off the top of my head I don't

(33:31) remember but um but that's what that's what they did they unionized under one and anybody who went against the idea of

(33:38) alopathic medicine was completely destroyed they were completely I mean they just destroyed them so doctors

(33:43) themselves did this to us not not the average person consider like a prescription of uh you

(33:51) know you need to Oh yeah the better American medical association that's Right. Medical

(33:57) association. Would you consider like exercise and a better diet to be homeopathic?

(34:03) I don't know that I would call that homeopathic. But there's more there's more types of medicine than just alopathic. And so the thing is is uh

(34:11) diet and exercise obviously are good preventative care. But now even doctors are moving towards the ideas of

(34:17) preventive care. But they're trained by pharmaceutical companies as to prescribe. Pharmaceutical companies are

(34:22) what train these doctors. And who do they have contracts with? the government. So, it's pharmaceutical

(34:28) companies in unison with the government who come up with these type types of training programs for doctors. There's

(34:34) not universities anymore which aren't in the hands of pharmaceutical companies training MDs. All of their training

(34:40) programs are written by pharmaceutical companies. Yeah. I mean, my dad But do you know that it's progressives

(34:46) who push that? Progressives are the ones who push that and say, "Well, who else is going to train them?" Of course, pharmaceutical companies need, they're

(34:53) the ones who know their medicine better than anybody need to train doctors in the prescription of these things.

(34:58) Progressives are the ones who who push this. Uh well, I would differentiate between

(35:05) progressives and um again politicians and I believe both

(35:11) sides of the coin who uh generally more more corpses and Republicans who

(35:17) prioritize again profit over over people. Um

(35:23) but when you say that when you say that it's like um when when if you have a business do you

(35:30) want your business to be profitable? Of course. Yes. Okay. When you say over people though,

(35:36) does that mean if I give you bad service, am I prioritizing profit over you?

(35:42) No. But what I mean is um I I think that to have a uh welloiled you know kind of

(35:48) functioning society there are things that we need to not make profitable and

(35:54) I think that things like um uh you know medicine and housing. I think we need to

(36:02) have like some other European countries what they do do is they will have like both a sort of like a socialized aspect

(36:09) and then a privatized aspect where at a base level you are provided certain things so that you can continue to

(36:16) function and be alive. Yeah. But those things don't you think that those things only work because they have homogeneous nations which they can

(36:22) tax very heavily. they don't have the same income drags on immigrants that places like uh us have where it's

(36:29) endlessly demanded that we take more and more of them on. Like the places that you would point to where you have the

(36:34) types of socialized medicine you're talking about are places where there's a very very low entry level of immigrants

(36:41) very low. Um would you consider the UK to have like a very very Well, yes. I mean it is

(36:46) extremely hard to immigrate to the UK of course. Um, but again, I I have strong

(36:52) feelings about that in the sense that I feel like uh in in the US, but the UK I mean the UK model is not

(36:58) the model you're pointing to though, right? You're pointing to like the the model of uh Nordic nation. I say like maybe like the Netherlands or

(37:05) the Yes, the Nordic. Can you tell me can you tell me what the demographic of the Netherlands is?

(37:10) um primarily uh Caucasian like primarily or an overwhelming

(37:17) well I could check for yeah look let's look at uh population

(37:28) it is about 74% 74% um uh Dutch or freezians um let me see

(37:38) we could just do let's population of Netherlands

(37:44) um about 80% uh and then 20% is um ethnic minorities.

(37:52) Now do France France is doing pretty okay

(37:59) sure are what's the ethnic makeup there?

(38:07) Um about 75% is of uh European descent.

(38:14) No. Well, I think last I checked in France, I think it's closer to 90% is

(38:19) 90% who you would put in the category of Caucasian. And so the thing is is like

(38:25) when this is one thing about progressives that drives me crazy is that thing that does not thing that doesn't correlate with

(38:32) worldview gets rejected and then you move for some type of like explanation for the thing outside of the obvious

(38:38) one. If you're going to move in massive amounts of migrants who are extremely poor, they're going to drag your health

(38:44) care system. There's no way around that, right? Well, the the drag on the health care

(38:49) system um again I have I have done research on this and I could locate it again but we

(38:57) spend a lot of money subsidizing health care uh insurance companies which is to

(39:04) our detriment and I do think that a kind of singlepayer universal system would be

(39:09) uh a lot more efficient than um you know kind of the the health insurance model

(39:16) that we have Because I think that once we eliminate sort of like

(39:21) the uh unnecessary middleman it would be again sorry sorry sorry sorry in France correct 84 or I'm sorry 85% is what I

(39:28) got close I was close okay yeah so the thing but the thing is is uh how

(39:34) can it be if you want to have a socialized medicine like you want right why would you want to bring in

(39:41) tons and tons of poor people who need aid when it comes to their health and welfare wouldn't how is that not going

(39:46) to drag down your your health care system. Um, as far as I am aware, I haven't

(39:53) looked into the uh what the the kind of uh

(39:59) the cost on the American taxpayer is on like immigrant uh undocumented immigrants specifically. Um

(40:06) just any let's just go with any. If you bring in people who are poor

(40:12) and need healthare, how exactly are they not going to be a drain on your health care system? Like

(40:17) how how could that ever like what could you even offset that with? What is the thing you could even point to and be like, but that's offset with

(40:24) what don't even like seek out health care is the thing. Uh it's it's my understanding

(40:30) that we um for the most part uh because we are not

(40:35) reproducing at a rate that you know kind of adequately replaces our population.

(40:40) Um and because again of corporate and government greed um we have been dependent upon what is essentially I

(40:47) would say a slave class uh of undocumented laborers who are paid next

(40:52) to nothing. Um but uh again,

(40:59) so that would be bad, right? Don't you want them to not be here? Well, I would prefer that they be

(41:05) naturalized and I would prefer that, you know, people be Why not just send them back home and then we have immigration policies based

(41:12) on the idea that we bring people in who aren't a net drag uh to our economy and

(41:17) a net drag to our health care system. Why are they drag on our economy? Because I guess my issue here is that

(41:24) again like immigration makes up such a huge portion of our labor force. Like if

(41:30) you think about specifically we're not just talking about GDP trade. Yeah. We're not just talking about GDP, right? Uhhuh.

(41:35) You can have this massive gross domestic product, but what's our debt? You know, what's our debt and our

(41:41) deficit spending and the things like this? It's like it's not just about your gross domestic product, which by the way, China is not dependent on immigrant

(41:48) labor and they have the second largest GDP in the world. So the there's sort of like this idea here that for some reason

(41:56) we need to bring in a massive amount of really really poor people from other nations and that that's not going to

(42:02) have an effect on the American taxpayer that drags us down. I've never actually understood that. I've never understood

(42:08) why progressives push for that. Um, so I've I've I have looked this up

(42:14) and I think that I would need to read through this fully and it's okay if you don't want to doubt my if you want to

(42:21) doubt my source, but it does seem like overall immigration does boost economic growth. Uh, however, again, you're

(42:28) right, that could just be boosting I guess suppose G gross domestic product. Yeah. So it

(42:34) pushes out gross domestic product. I wouldn't even dispute that, but who cares, right? It's like if it is the

(42:40) case that you're born uh you know $290,000 in debt. I I'm not that I'm

(42:45) just using an extreme example, right? But let's just if you're just born into that kind of debt, who gives a [ __ ] what your gross

(42:52) domestic product is? Like wouldn't you want people to be coming into your nation who are

(43:00) contributing to the nation more than they're taking away from the nation? Isn't that the whole goal? And if you're

(43:06) you're bringing in uh very poor people from very poor nations, how in the hell is that going to make like tell me this,

(43:12) let me just ask this. This is my mindset, right? And maybe you can say it's it's

(43:17) too pragmatic or something like this, but how is bringing in like 50,000 poor

(43:24) South Americans going to help my life? How's that going to improve my life?

(43:29) Um well again because Americans are not reproducing enough to kind of fill our

(43:34) I've reproduced enough. All right. Well that's you. But I mean

(43:40) because of the cost of child care I would say um and because of inflation

(43:46) you know most people most parents need to you know have like a double income household to have children. Uh again a

(43:53) lot of people just aren't having kids at the same rates that we used to. um which

(43:58) is so shouldn't we focus on that problem instead of focusing on trying to replace the population with some other people

(44:04) group doesn't that seem silly I mean I think that realistically what do we do in the meantime when we do have

(44:11) this sort of deficit in uh you know like like nativeborn um

(44:18) labor well here's what I'll tell you what I would do right but what I would do is I would have a mass government-based

(44:26) uh overarching campaign pain and I would have billboards everywhere and I would bring back the idea of the nobility and

(44:31) respect of the family and the idea that uh the highest calling and duties and virtues of women are to have children

(44:38) and the highest calling and virtues of men are to be fathers and I would bring the idea that universalized respect

(44:45) comes with having a family and those are things which are to be cherished and those are the things that everybody's

(44:51) moving towards and I think you'd see the birth rates greatly increase. Hungary had a program that was very similar to

(44:57) this. Uh not only did they uh kind of nationalized the propaganda for birth

(45:03) rates, but they also gave massive tax incentives. If you had three or more children, you were taxexempt for life

(45:09) and that the recovery is already beginning and it's showing some great fruit. Um but I think you can do things like

(45:15) that. And I I don't I don't even see a problem with it. But what you can't do is you can't give people the mixed

(45:21) message of like uh I was arguing with a girl this morning on Pierce Morgan for instance who was trying to say well what

(45:27) about lesbians? What about gay people? What about this other outlier group? Um who cares, right? The idea is to

(45:34) propagate birth rates and propagate your citizenry. Uh why do we care about, you know, propagating these like [ __ ]

(45:42) fringe cases of, you know, some gay dude wants to adopt a kid or some lesbian chick wants to adopt a kid? Why are we

(45:49) pushing huge millions and millions of dollars of resources towards that instead of the domestic reproduction of

(45:54) our nation? That doesn't that seem silly? I think most adopes are heterosexual

(46:00) couples. Um overwhelmingly, yes. Overwhelmingly, yes. Uh, however, I

(46:05) think that as much as you could push sort of, you know, uh, you know, like,

(46:12) you know, from a from an ideological standpoint, yes, you could push like we should have more families. You know, the

(46:18) highest calling of of someone is to be a father or a mother. Um, I think that the

(46:24) issue with that is that a lot of people just can't really afford it. Um because I think it's you know I

(46:31) I think they could afford it if they got tax exemption for the rest of their life if they had three kids plus sure

(46:36) then I think they could afford it and if like there was rent control um if there were socialized

(46:43) like why do you even need uh why do you even need rent control you know like for for one thing

(46:49) um when when you dive into the the idea of of markets the idea is that

(46:55) uh there's not enough housing to go around and that's why rent so high, right? That's the idea.

(47:01) Uh like Kla Harris wanted to build more houses to bring the rent prices down. That was the goal.

(47:07) Um I think it depends upon the area, but from what my my point of view from

(47:15) living in uh I've lived in very rural small towns and I've lived in cities and

(47:20) largely the issue in cities is that there is uh it's just really expensive. Like there's

(47:26) housing because there's not but it costs a [ __ ] lot. Yeah, there's not. Well, it's because of supply and demand, right? The idea is

(47:31) that the demand is higher than the supply and so if the demand is higher than the supply, you can basically charge whatever the [ __ ] you want for

(47:38) it. So if the idea then is well, we want to have more housing, right? That would So

(47:43) imagine it this way. If you move to a neighborhood where 20 of the or you know

(47:51) 18 of the houses out of 20 were vacant, right? Nobody wanted to live there. Do

(47:56) you think that the the rent there would be higher or lower than in other areas of that city? Probably

(48:03) higher. No, they'd be lower, right? They'd be But I mean, so isn't the idea if you want to bring in massive amounts

(48:09) of migrants and you don't have the kind of housing which is necessary for them that that's going to increase the rents

(48:15) of people who are around you? Wouldn't that wouldn't that be an entailment of that? Correct me if I'm wrong, but is it

(48:22) are we not having an issue right now in which uh groups like My god, I confuse

(48:27) Black Water and Black Rockck all the time. Which one is the mercenary company? Um,

(48:32) is that Black Rockck? I think I think it's Black Water, actually. Blackwater. Maybe I'm wrong, too. I don't know.

(48:38) Which one is buying up all like the property? because there is an issue where you know corporations are you know

(48:44) buying buying up excessive amounts of property which I think is like

(48:49) disconcerting. I think it's less you know Yeah. But they're buying up rural property right.

(48:55) Uh and in in the cities as well. Yeah. Sure. I mean there are industries which will buy up property. McDonald's

(49:01) their entire their entire idea is they make all their money on real estate not on their cheeseburgers. That's their

(49:06) whole business model. Really? Yeah. Yeah, they make all their they make all their money in real. Well,

(49:13) that's why the food is [ __ ] trash and garbage. They don't care. The whole point is to make money off of the rents for the various McDonald's locations.

(49:20) But that's neither here nor there. I'm just pointing out if we're if we're going to dive into the ideas of the problems here.

(49:27) I would like to just start with this idea of like how does it really make a nation

(49:33) stronger? How is diversity really this great strength whereas uh homogeneity is

(49:39) not? Why is why is the idea that people aren't speaking the same language and they don't have the same customs and

(49:45) they don't have the same culture. How does that really make you better or stronger or you know or greater? I don't

(49:52) I I actually don't understand why there's even a like contention over this to be honest with you.

(49:58) Sure. Um, I could I could give you uh I mean this is anecdotal

(50:03) um but again someone that has lived in uh I lived in you know Scotland, the UK,

(50:10) Glasgow, um I felt that uh oh [ __ ] sorry I just got

(50:18) a loud notification. Um I when I when I lived in Glasgow,

(50:26) uh I felt that it was a weakness of the uh

(50:34) the British individuals that I met to be so not only were they kind of like

(50:41) uncomfortable with and prejudiced uh towards individuals who had different

(50:46) skin colors, but also towards like I mean frankly Europe Europe is very strange. They view people who look

(50:52) exactly like them but live like 10 minutes down the road as like nearly alien. Uh and

(50:59) they do the same thing. You'll see it you'll see it with like in Michigan the Dutch and the Irish. They hate each

(51:04) other's guts. You'll see it in the South. Uh there's various southerners who hate other southerners. You know

(51:09) what I mean? Uh Texas basically hates everybody who's not Texan. There's this has been this is because the idea is the

(51:17) way the way people groups operate, they operate within the division of culture. So I don't care about racialism. That's

(51:24) unimportant to me. I've never given a [ __ ] about it. Yeah. But culture I do care about. So I think

(51:29) that culture is downwind of theology. So I think we start with theological principles and then that creates some

(51:35) sort of philosophy which informs culture. These cultural dynamics whether it's democracy, monarchy, things like that

(51:42) come from whatever the kind of theological base was and then from there your politics is downwind from that from

(51:48) culture. The question becomes is like if you were to take somebody who had the

(51:54) identical um I don't know the identical makeup of me but he was black. I don't give a

(52:00) [ __ ] Right? So if they were identically uh culturally similar, you know what I mean? or just identical culturally. Uh

(52:07) what do I care? There's no there's no distinction there, right? It it's never been of uh of particular note to me.

(52:14) But what is of particular note to me is that not all cultures are equal. And even postmodernists and this was the

(52:21) contention we were having in the debate I was trying to explain like there's definitely cultures which are

(52:26) not equal to the one that you live in. And as a defense mechanism, as human beings, we we recognize patterns of

(52:33) behavior, especially cultural patterns of behavior. The reason racialism exists is because they associate the race with

(52:39) the pattern of behavior. And so therefore, uh they see it as a protective mode to move away from that

(52:45) people group because they don't want to engage with that pattern of behavior. So if it is the case that there's a culture

(52:53) uh you know of like I don't cannibals, right? but they all happen to be one color, right?

(52:59) Uh, of course that's going to lead to racial prejudice because it's an identification for cultural behavior.

(53:04) You know what I mean? Now, I'll grant that in modernity there's tons of people who can culturally integrate into

(53:10) various nations who are different colors and that's fine because they can culturally integrate. We've we've seen

(53:16) this actually and it's worked it's worked fairly well to some degrees. Uh but when you bring in cultures which

(53:22) cannot add mix well that seems like it's a it's like diabolically stupid, right?

(53:28) Like it just seems it just seems so counterintuitive and stupid and it brings so much contention. I don't even

(53:33) understand what the point is. Um I mean again I I feel that uh

(53:41) again I I feel that and this is my just opinion anecdotal as a white American. I

(53:48) felt that um I I feel I suppose more open to

(53:56) different cultures and living together which I do think uh encourages people who immigrate here to in turn be open to

(54:04) mine. And what I feel like is what we end up with is sort of a a net positive

(54:09) where you can bring the good in in both cultures together to kind of create

(54:15) something new. And I think that outside of Yeah. I mean, you obviously like uh

(54:21) whiteness as a as a construct is kind of relatively new in the way that we think about it. Um I'm sure you're aware that

(54:26) like waves of European immigrants were not seen as like the exact same as sort

(54:31) of the Anglo-Saxon individuals. Um, for instance, like uh Germans that we would

(54:37) think of as uh, you know, super duper duper white at one point were very much

(54:43) like this barbaric uh, race of people immigrating to the US. Um, actually it are you aware of the

(54:50) Donner party? Yeah, it was ate each other in Donner Pass in the Sierra Neadas.

(54:55) Correct. Yes, I actually grew up around that area right there. Me too. Um, oh, interesting. Okay. Um the uh one

(55:03) of the German immigrants in the donor party was uh you know served served the

(55:08) blame nearly totally because of his uh you know freaky German tendencies

(55:14) because at the time there was a lot of anti-German prejudice. Um Jesus Christ, where was I going with this?

(55:21) Well, I think you were trying to get into the ideas of cultural integration.

(55:26) Um but the thing the thing is is like well would you say that one of the strengths of America um is that we are

(55:34) kind of a a melting pot and we aren't. So, uh, like for instance, like I think

(55:41) that one of the the best things that, um, you know, our country was founded on was the idea that you could practice

(55:48) essentially any faith without, you know, um, being persecuted for it.

(55:54) Unless it was Catholicism or Islam or any number of different non-protestant

(55:59) sects, uh, you could definitely be persecuted for it, especially at our foundation. All 13 colonies had their

(56:06) own religion and all of them were ratified as state religions. Even postfounding, so even postfounding, each

(56:13) state had their own religion that was a state religion. All of them. Well, I'm sorry. All I

(56:19) think all of them except two had had a state religion. So like, no, not really.

(56:25) Like the idea the idea for that the idea for uh our founders anyway was uh if you

(56:32) if you weren't a Christian they weren't they they they really weren't wanting to bring you into the nation at all and uh

(56:40) if if you were a Catholic they really didn't want you here either. So oh I mean yeah for sure. Yeah. So the thing is is like you really

(56:46) weren't able to do all of the kind of open like if our founders knew that a bunch of postmodernist women were

(56:52) running around practicing witchcraft. What do you think they would have done about that?

(56:58) Uh, I mean it I think it depends upon which one and which which period in

(57:04) time, but I think it is un our founding fathers in 17 let's say 1780

(57:09) they they go on TikTok and they see hundreds of thousands of American women practicing witchcraft. What do you think

(57:14) they would do? You think they'd be like, "Well, that's freedom, boys."

(57:21) I think that that depends. Maybe potentially. You think so? Um I think that the the witch trials

(57:26) were largely over at that point. Not to say that there wasn't prejudice. Absolutely. But I mean I think

(57:32) comparatively there was certainly you know I mean significantly more

(57:37) religious freedom in comparison to to Europe. Uh

(57:43) I mean right? Uh no I'm not sure that that's the case.

(57:48) Uh, so this would be regional maybe in some places in Europe, but really this country was founded by

(57:54) Protestant English and French people and they really didn't want anybody around who wasn't Protestant English or French.

(58:01) That was it. You talk about Germans for instance, the reason there was so much anti-German sentiment is because they

(58:06) spoke German. And the reason there was so much anti-Dutch sentiment is because they spoke Dutch. They couldn't understand each other. And it created this cultural

(58:13) barrier. These cultural barriers cause problems, right? They cause problems. Now, when you have strict integration, if you were

(58:19) to have strict integration where everybody who came in spoke the exact same language and they followed similar

(58:24) cultural customs, I don't think you'd have the same kinds of problems. But that is not indeed what's going on.

(58:30) What's going on is you you you kind of progressives make these uh ridiculous bold claims like uh hey uh if we if we

(58:38) have these various cultures intermixing or uh this or that, it's going to create some brand new awesome culture. Where

(58:45) where has it ever done that here? Where where's the like brand new awesome culture that came out of uh these

(58:52) culture clashes? Where the [ __ ] is that? It doesn't seem like we have an awesome culture anywhere I can point at.

(58:58) Um I mean I am uh particularly fond of uh I mean you're you I don't know if

(59:06) you're a fan of California, but I am a uh I'm a fan of of California. Um,

(59:12) what parts? I have lived in uh mostly Northern

(59:18) California. That's where I was raised. In the upper areas like uh like Well, I mean that's a lot of Northern

(59:24) California areas. Those are Northern California is a I

(59:30) mean that's a rich area, right? There's lots of yepy areas. So, what area are we talking about? Are do you familiar with

(59:38) the region um east of the Sacramento? Uh what's it called?

(59:45) I will put it in the private chat because don't don't put it in the private chat. It'll show up on my

(59:51) screen. Don't put it in the private chat. Um but what I'm saying is I grew up in a very rural poor area. It was not a yepy

(59:57) area. Okay. a very poor homogeneous area because most of them are pretty it was a mixture of uh of like mostly

(1:00:06) white and Mexican frankly that's largely been the um and while there was like

(1:00:11) absolutely yes like racism and clashes for the most part especially between the young people it was fairly

(1:00:18) peaceful uh and I do feel like I mean

(1:00:24) frankly I mean this is this is not really necessarily moral but I would say that um

(1:00:30) my god food-wise, music-wise, dance-wise, culturally, I think that it

(1:00:36) has been California itself has been enriched by the uh significant immigrant population. It is also better for your

(1:00:43) brain to speak more languages. There is it's dangerous. I mean, California is dangerous as hell. It's I mean, there's

(1:00:49) some of the cities there are like war zones. You know what I mean? Same thing with Chicago. Same thing with uh I mean

(1:00:56) there's lots of places anywhere that you see these massive influxes and these cultural clashes. What just happened in

(1:01:02) California, massive riots in the streets and people waving Mexican flags saying viva la

(1:01:08) Mexico uh on American streets. Like how is that not how is that peaceful when they're

(1:01:15) like dropping [ __ ] on cop cars, right? When they're [ __ ] burning [ __ ] Like we covered those riots every single day

(1:01:21) that they were going on. We covered them in depth. If I had 15 cameras up at a time and we were well I mean that that's

(1:01:28) hyperbole, right? I had a lot of cameras up at a time covering every little aspect because I know a clipper later will be

(1:01:33) like I counted he only 12, right? Um but we were watching it, right? We

(1:01:39) were watching the great dumpster mo fights in California as these guys would get behind dumpsters and throw bottles,

(1:01:45) molotov cocktails and screech about racial injustices and things like that for a nation they don't even have to be

(1:01:50) in. And it's like, how is that how is that enriching? Two things here. Um, I don't know if

(1:01:56) you've ever been to like Boston, but my dad's from that region. It's very white. That place is crazy. Uh, and I would I

(1:02:04) would say the amount of like, you know, neness and politeness over there is significantly lower than my experience

(1:02:12) with California. But also, again, California was originally

(1:02:18) a property of of Mexico. Uh, and it is kind of a thing with like

(1:02:24) Chico, uh, which is Mexican-American culture, to be very like, woo, Mexico, in a way that I don't think is harmful

(1:02:30) in the sense that like for instance, my grandfather, uh, grew up in a town in

(1:02:35) the Midwest that spoke German and English and was very proudly German.

(1:02:42) In Boston, Massachusetts, the white population is approximately 44%.

(1:02:47) Okay. Well, I'm sure that's lower than uh California, which is uh primarily

(1:02:53) Hispanic um in Los Angeles. Yeah. So, but you said that it's mostly a white population, right?

(1:02:58) I think that white people would probably be the highest population there versus

(1:03:04) non-white individuals. Yeah, they would be the majority minority. Yeah, sure. At 44%, right? But they're not they

(1:03:11) wouldn't be the majority. They would just be out of all of the minorities at 44%. They would be the majority of those. Do you know anything about

(1:03:16) Oregon? A bit. Yeah. Okay. So, I lived in Portland for a few

(1:03:22) years and I would say compared [ __ ] Portland. Yeah. It sucked. Uh Portland is majority white. For a

(1:03:28) very long time in Oregon, they would only allow white people to move there.

(1:03:33) Uh Portland is in the US the city with the highest white population. It has

(1:03:39) extremely little diversity. Now, I have lived in San Francisco. I have lived in

(1:03:44) Sacramento. I lived in Los Angeles. Uh, and I saw homeless people all the time and there's been very few experiences in

(1:03:51) those cities where I felt unsafe. And who runs those cities? Progressives. Progressives. Portland

(1:03:57) also progressive city. Yes. Like how progressive? Majority white. Majority white. Uh, Portland is way more progressive than

(1:04:03) the rest of the cities. Portland um,

(1:04:09) nightmare zone. I I have I mean people like running around with machetes and [ __ ] I have a lot of thoughts on how

(1:04:15) Portland operates though. What they did was they decriminalized all drugs um because of progressives,

(1:04:21) right? But what they didn't do was they uh did not make rehab affordable or

(1:04:28) mandatory. So what they did was essentially have a bunch of people running around on drugs with essentially

(1:04:33) no cheap way to get sober. Uh and oh gee, legalizing drugs. Who would have

(1:04:40) thought that would be a bad idea? conservatives, right? Uh I mean, I think that if you

(1:04:45) decriminalize um in a way that doesn't feed people into the prison system, but instead assist them in getting healthy,

(1:04:53) don't you think there's a distinction in drugs though, like so what what what liberals will do is they'll say or

(1:04:59) progressives, they'll be like, well, uh you know, you can decriminalize weed and that's better

(1:05:04) because then you're not throwing people in jail for an ounce of pot or this or that. But it's like, okay, I can even grant that because marijuana itself

(1:05:12) doesn't seem to drive people into things like theft and sucking dick behind dumpsters for more marijuana, right?

(1:05:18) But, uh, if we look at like heroin addicts and [ __ ] like that, they do that kind of [ __ ] There's like there's a big

(1:05:25) distinction in decriminalizing a soft drug, right, and decriminalizing [ __ ]

(1:05:32) heroin addicts and giving them clean needles and [ __ ] Like like why would anybody ever think that was a good idea?

(1:05:38) It's a terrible idea. They did it in San Francisco progressive. Portland progressive. Uh they did it in regions

(1:05:45) of Nevada run by progressives. Why the [ __ ] do progressives want to give everybody [ __ ] free needles to shoot

(1:05:51) up and [ __ ] It's crazy. Um I think that so we are like

(1:05:57) inadequately copying um my goodness. I think it's the Swiss model or what they

(1:06:02) do is they do give people clean needles. Um, but also what we don't do again is we do

(1:06:10) not offer proper avenues to help people get sober. And that is something that I

(1:06:15) feel very very very strongly about. Um, because I I think that uh the best way

(1:06:22) to to assist people is to not feed them into the prison system. Um,

(1:06:28) but again, also help them help them get clean. Uh, and we can do that again by

(1:06:35) offering programs that help. Can't you just force them into a rehab clinic by force?

(1:06:41) I mean, sure we could, but again, Portland didn't do that. Yeah, I know. But they should have done that, right?

(1:06:46) Yes. Yes. But isn't that imprisoning people? But isn't that imprisoning people? Really? Like isn't the idea?

(1:06:52) I think that a treatment program is different from like just prison prison which doesn't really do much.

(1:06:57) What's the difference? Like okay maybe a difference in condition like you can watch more TV or something like that but

(1:07:03) the idea if if you're forced to go to a treatment center by force you have to stay there. the way the way that the

(1:07:10) prison system works in the US is that it doesn't really offer it it doesn't feel

(1:07:16) like kind of like reparative justice in the sense that I think that we in the US

(1:07:23) rely so much on private prism private prison labor um we want more people in

(1:07:30) prisons essentially it's it's an industry and it is a problem so instead of you know focusing on making sure

(1:07:36) people can become kind of upstanding uh you know members of society what we do is we make it harder for them to

(1:07:43) integrate back into society. One of my great uncles uh you know kind of his life mission he's a very Christian man

(1:07:50) is to uh you know assist like people who have been recently released from prison

(1:07:56) um to help them integrate back into society. But it is difficult because we put so many barriers in their way um as

(1:08:04) far as like uh the help we give you know prisoners after they are released um

(1:08:10) their job opportunities their ability again to participate in society. So we have to have like some sort of I mean

(1:08:18) social net to help these people. We can't just let them continue to live in

(1:08:23) such under such like horrific um conditions. Well, let me ask you a question. If this

(1:08:29) is the case, I've thought about this a lot and I've heard progressives make this kind of analogy a lot. You know,

(1:08:34) where's the compassion for those who have been released from prison? So, let's say in Chicago land over the

(1:08:42) weekend, and I don't even know what the numbers are, but I I can almost assure you that there's at least more than five

(1:08:47) people who were shot over the weekend in Chicago. Okay. It's Chicago. Mhm. Yeah. So, uh so five people, they murder five

(1:08:55) other people. If we had like your perfect your perfect kind of system in

(1:09:02) place, these people are all arrested, what happens?

(1:09:07) Um, I mean, I need to look at the uh because most countries, particularly people who are in in prison for the long

(1:09:14) term, are in there for violent assault and and murder. But uh in in the US, the

(1:09:22) majority of prisoners are not in there for violent crime. Um which is which is

(1:09:28) an issue. I do I do think that we ought to probably put people somewhere for violent crimes.

(1:09:33) What about financial crimes though? Financial crimes are or can be just as destructive. You would agree like Bernie

(1:09:40) Maid off and what he did to thousands of people. I would I would say destroying a thousand people's lives financially

(1:09:46) would give you kind of the same I would give you the same punishment as I would give a murderer maybe.

(1:09:52) Um I mean sure there is sort of a like a the premise of social murder. Yes. Like

(1:09:58) we could uh actually I don't know if I can talk about this. I was going to say

(1:10:03) there are perhaps some healthcare higher up executive types that could be

(1:10:09) accused of social murder. um that certainly I think should probably face

(1:10:14) repercussions of some kind through the legal system. Uh however, I do believe

(1:10:19) but back to this. Hang on. Back I'm sorry. Back to this. Uhhuh. Non-s serious. You have five You have five of them.

(1:10:25) They shoot five other people. What happens in your world for these people? What happens? Um, well, yeah, I

(1:10:32) I would want these people to uh be in prison, but I also think that we we would need to account for

(1:10:39) age as well. I do think and they're all 24. I mean, 24.

(1:10:44) Mhm. That's fairly young. And I don't actually have a perfect response for this, but I do think that I mean, you

(1:10:51) would I suppose it depends. How far does forgiveness go? And how do we determine

(1:10:57) when someone is, you know, ready to be a member of society again? Because

(1:11:05) many people, especially, well, I don't think these are um are equivalent, right? So, if the idea is

(1:11:12) I can forgive you for murdering my family. That doesn't give you a pass to escape justice anymore than if you were

(1:11:18) a prostitute for 20 years. Christ, the Christian community may forgive you, but that doesn't give you carb blanch to

(1:11:24) marry a Christian man either. Um the idea Yeah. Why would why would the idea

(1:11:30) that you're forgiven for your sin suddenly make you entitled um to to somebody else's like uh

(1:11:37) revolted response? So if there was a guy, he was a Christian, but he was still revolted by your past sexual sins,

(1:11:44) he would have no obligation to date you because he was a Christian, would he? Well, no. Yeah. No one is entitled to uh

(1:11:52) sex or marriage or dating. Absolutely. Yeah. Right. So, if it was a great So, yeah. So, if he if he thought, well,

(1:11:58) that you were an Only Fans girl for 20 years. I'm glad you're not anymore. Uh, and you know, I'm Jesus Christ can

(1:12:05) forgive all your sins. That doesn't buy you like a new reputation. You don't suddenly get a new reputation. And

(1:12:10) you're like, "Oh, well, now I'm uh just like one of you." It's like, well, sin

(1:12:16) is very staining and it causes significant problems and damage internally to people when practiced over

(1:12:22) an elongated period of time. You don't just bounce back. And so the the idea of like

(1:12:29) um the this this kind of idea that you can forgive somebody, but then that gives them carb blanch to escape

(1:12:35) whatever the punishment is for their crimes to me is also kind of equally silly. Right.

(1:12:42) Right. Well, we have different uh opinions on sex work, maybe. Um, and I

(1:12:49) also think that so I know Mary Magdalene was most likely not actually a sex worker. I think she's larit.

(1:12:56) I'm glad you got that right. I get so tired of correcting people that Mary Well, yeah, I think it was Mary of Egypt. I believe that that was a sex

(1:13:02) worker who became an aesthetic and segregated lived in the desert. Yeah. Segregated herself away from

(1:13:08) everybody else so that she could make sure that her sin wasn't spread. And the reason that she was made a saint and so

(1:13:13) pious is because she refused to corrupt other people with her internal demons.

(1:13:19) Right? So I do think that again I don't want to get into sex work because I do think we're going to have some pretty

(1:13:24) significant fundamental disagreements about it. Um, but as far as murderers go, for instance, if I met a 24 year old

(1:13:31) who maybe grew up in an area that was extremely poor and prone to gang violence and at the age of, you know,

(1:13:38) maybe only one parent in the household and at the age of 10 was kind of

(1:13:43) indoctrinated into a gang and was, you know, through through that sort of

(1:13:51) system because this person lacked any sort of like extremely important like

(1:13:56) familial uh and you know like school support

(1:14:01) became a gang member. Mhm. I would of course yes I would want that person to serve time.

(1:14:07) How much? But I would want them to I mean for like cold bloodooded for cold bloodooded murder how much time?

(1:14:13) Well years how many? Um I'm not sure. I'm not quite sure. I think that enough to go through some

(1:14:19) sort of like again especially prison in the US. I mean, I got my god. I think

(1:14:24) that that gets people into gangs. Um, which is not good. I think we're putting into putting people into a system where

(1:14:31) they are liable to reaffend, which is not good. We're not putting them into a system where Do you see Do you see how what you do is

(1:14:38) you give descriptions. You're like you you describe what could have led up to what the problem is,

(1:14:43) but you don't give a descriptor for, okay, this thing happens right now. What do you actually do different?

(1:14:51) Well, it's the the same thing that I'm telling you is I I mean it's also how it functions legally. They determine I I

(1:14:56) won't say our our justice system is not just it's very corrupt most of the time. Um and so what would you do different

(1:15:03) though? That's my whole point is like you're let's say you're the unilateral queen of America tomorrow. You have the

(1:15:10) scepter and all power of the government. Day one, you sit down. It's a judging

(1:15:15) day. Mhm. Five cold-blooded murderers are in front of you. Okay. All of them

(1:15:21) for judgment. What's your judgment? Um, well, I would want to uh look at

(1:15:29) what brought them I think like any legal case, they discuss why someone did what they did and what led them to do what

(1:15:35) they do. They're multiple. They've been they they have huge track records, violent crime,

(1:15:41) criminal uh criminal activities all the time. And it ended with him murdering people. Why? Well, in this case, one

(1:15:48) person, each one of them, very similar backstory. Uh, well, obviously they are dangerous,

(1:15:55) so I would want them not in society for the time being, but I wouldn't want them to be put into a system where gang

(1:16:01) allegiance and violence would be further encouraged, which is essentially the prison system. I would want them to uh,

(1:16:08) you know, enter into a sort of restorative justice system where they learn Obviously, we need some therapy uh

(1:16:16) and we need some like practical life skill teachings um to after they leave

(1:16:24) possibly maybe like 10 years, 10, 15 years, they can reenter society

(1:16:29) and be able to function like a normal human being for the most part. That's

(1:16:35) that is what I would want. Um, but we I'm thinking right now in my head, I'm

(1:16:40) imagining early 20s young uh offenders.

(1:16:45) I'm not imagining like Ted Bundy torturing people in his basement. That is

(1:16:50) I don't think that I don't know if a Ted Bundy type is really again that's a that's a completely antisocial human

(1:16:56) being. That is someone that I think is uh now if I'm the let's say that the roles are reversed and I'm the unilateral king

(1:17:04) of America and these four are brought in front of me for judging day and the evidence is overwhelming of their guilt. I would

(1:17:10) hang them. Mhm. Okay. Am I doing do you think from your view

(1:17:16) do you think that I just made society more or less safe? I think that temporarily you have made

(1:17:23) it more safe, but long term I don't think that why why not why wouldn't it be severe

(1:17:29) punishments like that? Why wouldn't it be more safe if long term if you coldbloodedly killed

(1:17:35) somebody and we uh judged you guilty and we threw a rope across a short tree and we hung

(1:17:42) you. How would that make society less safe? How? Um, well, to be honest, I have issues

(1:17:50) with the death penalty in the sense that I am wary of uh any sort of policy that

(1:17:56) gives the state kind of permission to uh

(1:18:02) to to take our lives. State has permission to take your life during a draft if you're a man.

(1:18:09) I also disagree with the draft. I'm against. So, no, no protection for the nation.

(1:18:15) Um, I think that it should be voluntarily. Well, what if you need to raise men very

(1:18:22) quickly for a war that uh, you know, they ordinarily would not want to get

(1:18:27) involved in uh, but need to for the purposes of national security. You don't want your men to be able to be drafted

(1:18:33) in that instance. I would say that the last time we were in a war like that was World War II. I

(1:18:40) don't know how you was the Vietnam War. I don't know if that was a matter of national security necessarily. That's a

(1:18:45) very But that was the last time we had a draft. Yes. Um and I feel like it was a

(1:18:53) colossal failure of a war. Uh so you wouldn't have drafted anybody in World War II.

(1:19:00) I mean, geez, we're not operating on World War II logic right now. I can't say what I would have done then. I think

(1:19:07) maybe yes, but that was extreme need. But you would agree that the nature of

(1:19:12) warfare has changed. Correct. I don't think that we will ever need a draft. I

(1:19:18) think that we will always have Don't you think that that's pretty shortsighted?

(1:19:23) No. I mean, I I don't think so. If we think about the way warfare works now, it is it is largely drone warfare. We

(1:19:30) are not very boots on the ground. And I also think that I think they start with drones. Take a look at

(1:19:35) the Ukraine and Russia. They started with drones and they start with aircraft, but it's being fought in the trenches

(1:19:41) with guys with AR-15s, right? Because inevitably all warfare comes down to like tactics aren't really going

(1:19:48) to change that much over time. After you get through all the bombs and all the drones and you get through all the

(1:19:53) airplanes and you get through all that, it going to come down to men with guns killing each other. Right. Sure. But when was the last time that we

(1:20:00) had a war on US soil? Was it was it the Civil War? um

(1:20:08) an actual war on US soil, I think. So, yes. Yeah. So, I I think that defense of the

(1:20:15) the nation physically. Yeah. Uh a draft then

(1:20:22) certainly. Yes. If we are being invaded and mass sure um what if you know you're going to be

(1:20:28) invaded though and you don't want to get invaded so you want to preemptively strike. And in order to do that, you

(1:20:34) need to do a massive military buildup. Well, I think that we would do uh what

(1:20:41) we have done in the past, which is essentially, you know, um bomb. We have bombed places.

(1:20:48) Yeah, I know. But not every place in the world can we just go bomb, right? Like we can bomb Iran and we can bomb like

(1:20:54) these little third world countries and [ __ ] Uh but first world nations, we would have a much harder time, right?

(1:21:00) Mhm. Yeah. Sure. But we also have as the as the US we have put ourselves in a situation

(1:21:06) where many first world nations are in fact dependent upon us. Um look I look I agree. I'm just saying

(1:21:12) that if it is the case that you had like a foreign military buildup and it was actionable

(1:21:20) right and you needed to build your forces quickly wouldn't you use conscription? Like that makes sense right?

(1:21:26) I mean, sure, but again, I just don't know if this is going to be a possibility because again, I think that you would agree that the nature of

(1:21:32) warfare has changed. I think we are largely hang on. So, I'll back up, but I want to show you something. The

(1:21:38) reason I want to kind of get all this out, you don't think the government should have control over life or death.

(1:21:43) You don't think that the government should have control over uh us being drafted? These are all sovereignty

(1:21:50) arguments, right? Do you think the government should be able to tax us?

(1:21:55) Um, I would say yes because I think that if you are benefiting from a society,

(1:22:02) which our taxes go to things like the roads, um, education, health insurance.

(1:22:09) Yeah. Uh, and we could say the military as well. Yeah. Um, we we do benefit from these things.

(1:22:15) So, I we would benefit from conscription, too. I don't know if we benefited from

(1:22:22) conscription during Vietnam because again I I do feel like we are

(1:22:28) you think we benefited from conscription in World War II, right?

(1:22:34) I think the rest of the world probably benefited more than we did. Okay. But do you see how strange it is

(1:22:40) to me and this I hear this from pro progressives a lot. draft, bad,

(1:22:46) prison, bad, government power over life and death, bad, right? Government power over being able to tax you against your

(1:22:53) will, good. And the justification is always the same. Well, it's because you get something out of it. But here's the

(1:22:58) thing that is always so bothersome to me about this. So, if I show up to your house, right,

(1:23:04) and I rob onethird of everything that's in your house, right, and then I leave you with $2,

(1:23:10) haven't I? Didn't you get something out of it? Uh, well, you're just a random person

(1:23:17) robbing me. Or are you building the road outside of my house? Yeah. Well, no, that doesn't matter,

(1:23:22) though. I left you with something. I don't think that's the same as taxation because again, when the

(1:23:28) government takes my taxes. Now, mind you, I have a lot of the same as the justification for taxes is my point. Like, the justification is

(1:23:34) it's okay because you get something out of it. If that's the case, then if I leave you $2, you got something out of it.

(1:23:41) Uh, I think that probably the benefit well ideally the benefit of paying taxes

(1:23:50) would would equal out to the money that I'm paying into the system, right? So like when I pay my taxes,

(1:23:56) I would also agree that it isn't, which bothers me. Um I think that you know Americans

(1:24:02) we should have our taxes like my taxes going towards the allocation of uh trans

(1:24:08) advocacy, gay rights, going towards the ideas of social justice, going towards

(1:24:13) the idea like in Michigan when Gretchen Whitmer took a bunch of the treasury uh and COVID relief and spent it on uh

(1:24:20) minority disaffected rates of COVID 19 instead of you know putting it towards critical infrastructure.

(1:24:26) How how how was that good for me? Exactly. How do these things How do these things actually beneficial to me?

(1:24:32) Are you from Michigan? Yeah, I live in Michigan. Oh, okay. Um,

(1:24:39) well, I suppose that that would be beneficial to other Michiganers. Be beneficial to not me.

(1:24:46) You also presumably you also drive on the roads, right? And do you are you Yeah. Do you how much like how much of

(1:24:51) my taxes do you think need to be spent on roads? Like let's say communally uh in in Michigan I pay $20 a year in

(1:24:58) road tax. Don't you think communally if everybody in Michigan paid that probably cover the roads? But let's just let I'll

(1:25:04) just grant it even higher. Let's say $200 a year. $200 a year from every person in

(1:25:09) Michigan communally. Now we got the roads taken care of, right? What the [ __ ] else am I getting here? What am I

(1:25:16) getting that's so great? Uh public education is also that's

(1:25:22) pretty good. Well, let's take a look. Where do we rank in public education? Poorly. Uh, schools suck. Um,

(1:25:28) yeah. And who's, by the way, and who's in charge of those? Women, right? Women are the ones No Child Left Behind. George,

(1:25:34) well, aren't women the ones who get all the degrees in education, and they're the ones who uh inundated the education

(1:25:40) system. They're basically in charge of education in the United States, and it's been an abysmal failure. Right? So, I

(1:25:45) look at this and I think, well, wait a second. So, what I'm getting for my taxes is I'm getting subpar education.

(1:25:52) some of the worst in the world, by the way. Right. There's other there's other terrible I mean, there's like terrible

(1:25:58) third world nations that do better than we do in reading and things like this. So, I'm not getting that. So, I have to

(1:26:04) opt out to homeschool kids so that they can even read and write by the time they're they're uh they're old enough to

(1:26:10) take on the world because they're not going to learn that in school. What they're going to learn in school is how to have sex, right? They're going to learn how to have sex and they're going

(1:26:16) to learn uh all sorts of uh social degeneracy and all kinds of crazy. They're not learning to read and write.

(1:26:22) They're learning how to uh engage in m like modern social dynamics which are

(1:26:28) generally pretty terrible for kids, especially when you introduce smartphones technology, things like that. And I get roads, right? And the

(1:26:36) roads in Michigan, I don't know if you ever driven on them, but they [ __ ] suck, right? I mean, they they're just terrible. So, what the [ __ ] am I really

(1:26:43) getting here? Like, what is the deal? What what is it that I get really for my taxes?

(1:26:49) Um, well, I don't know a lot about Michigan. Well, forget Michigan. I would say that I think that, um, in general,

(1:26:57) uh, my goodness, did George Bush not implement the No Child Left Behind

(1:27:02) policy and did Reagan not gut funding for public education? Because I I do think that the funding is certainly an

(1:27:08) issue. Why take a second? Hang on. Hang on. Take take a second, okay? And look up who spends the most on

(1:27:14) public education in the world.

(1:27:27) Um so what I got was the United States spends the most on public education globally both in terms of total

(1:27:32) expenditure and per pupil spending while other countries like Luxembourg and Norway may spend more per student in certain education levels or as a

(1:27:39) percentage of GDP. The US overall investment in education is so it can't be so it can't be funding can it? It must be something else.

(1:27:46) Percentage or I literally just told you it's it's per both. Both. Okay. We spend the most both per person and in

(1:27:54) general. So, how could it be? Hang on. Hang on. Let me just ask. How could it possibly be

(1:28:01) that progressives really believe that funding is the issue when we literally

(1:28:07) spend so much inc I mean so much more than other nations and this is the

(1:28:13) product we get. Uh well again I think you would agree

(1:28:18) that like the um administration is bloated and also

(1:28:25) funding can be determined by area and tax bracket. So pay teachers less.

(1:28:31) No uh teachers I wouldn't consider to be uh admin. Admin is like the bureaucrats essentially.

(1:28:37) Well let's find out what do public schools spend the most on in the United States.

(1:28:59) So this is in US public schools the largest expenditure is consistently on instruction particularly teacher

(1:29:04) salaries and oh wait what was it? It was teacher salaries. Teacher salaries and benefits. Yeah. So

(1:29:10) the teachers also make so wait. So hang on. So so now just so you know, now we've established that not only do we

(1:29:16) spend the most, but then you say when it's bloated, right? The whole thing is bloated. I say, well, wouldn't you cut

(1:29:21) teacher salaries? Well, we don't spend it all. That's exactly what we spend it all on, isn't it? So we're paying these

(1:29:26) people, we spend the most amount of money paying these people to not teach our [ __ ] kids anything. How is that a

(1:29:34) good idea? Doesn't that sound like a terrible idea? The whole reason I wanted to have this discussion with you is so I could show you I'm not some frothing

(1:29:41) foaming at the mouth [ __ ] crazy person. The opposite. The truth is is that I've just invested a ton of time

(1:29:47) into researching how these different infrastructure or these different um uh programs work and how the world around

(1:29:53) me works. The reason you didn't know that we spend the most on on education, the reason you didn't know that we spend

(1:29:59) the most in schools on teacher salaries is because you've been fed a pack of [ __ ] lies. Like what what what do

(1:30:06) you what do you think you're really getting for uh for the purposes of education in schools? Like what do you

(1:30:13) think any of this social justice [ __ ] does for you or your kids or the people around you or any of this bloated

(1:30:19) spending in teachers salaries who are always complaining they need to get paid more and yet they get paid some of the

(1:30:24) highest wages that teachers get paid anywhere in the world and we spend the most amount of money on their salaries

(1:30:30) to 87,000. Yeah. Comparably. So we're we're doing a comparable like what is comparable?

(1:30:37) We're spending the most amount of money in the world and most of it's going to teacher salaries.

(1:30:43) I mean is it because we just have a lot of people in the US? No. It's because Well, no.

(1:30:50) Well, it's also we have very few social compared to other countries. So, you

(1:30:55) know, educators are going to have to spend more to exist in the US. Don't you think that an obvious idea is that if

(1:31:01) you bring in tons and tons and tons and tons of people from from very poor nations that you're going to have to

(1:31:08) spend a ton more money on their education because they don't speak the language, they don't you know things

(1:31:14) like that? Like how is that how that's not helpful to us in any way, shape, or form? It just takes away and reallocates

(1:31:20) resources away uh from domestically born citizens. It seems so again so silly to

(1:31:25) me. Why? How much of our money, capital, and treasure should we be spending on all of these people, this massive influx

(1:31:32) of people? If you look not very long ago, uh if you look at the population

(1:31:38) rate at in the 50s60s, right? Uh you're looking at 150 million compared to 330

(1:31:44) million. We've been importing about a million immigrants a year into the United States. That is not healthy for

(1:31:50) us. And the idea that we spend all of this money uh on teacher salaries and

(1:31:56) this and that and and our kids come out and they can't even read and progressives are the ones who are in

(1:32:03) charge. They're the ones who are in charge of the social sciences. They're

(1:32:08) the ones who are in charge of the teaching. They're the ones who get the degrees in education. That's all

(1:32:13) progressives. They're in charge of this. How could they have [ __ ] this up this bad?

(1:32:20) I mean I would say that um well again first of all uh immigrants undocumented

(1:32:27) and documented do prop up farming caregiving uh

(1:32:33) second class citizens which we don't want which is horrible and I don't like that I'm not agreeing with that but what I'm

(1:32:39) saying is that Americans are frankly unwilling to fulfill those jobs for us and

(1:32:46) how come the Europeans can fulfill those jobs? Do Europeans hire Mexicans? Uh I do think that Europeans take

(1:32:52) advantage of um immigrant labor. Absolutely. Who? But uh

(1:32:58) what immigrant labor uh what like what immigrant labor?

(1:33:04) Yeah. Um I think Germany actually specifically for a while really really wanted uh you

(1:33:10) know immigrants to replace their their nativeorn population which was not reproducing at the same rate. However, I

(1:33:16) would like to say that uh again like the the kind of generalized curriculum

(1:33:23) that we have I don't think is always federally or you know determined by progressives that can be administration

(1:33:30) to administration. Again, I think that George Bush I would say is responsible for one of the most destructive

(1:33:37) uh policies in education which is what do you think our literacy rate was pre George Bush? It wasn't great either.

(1:33:45) We still have the same exact We still have the same exact problems. But my my question is this. Right now, right this

(1:33:51) second as we speak. Look up if women are over represented in

(1:33:56) degrees in education. No. Humanities and psych. Yeah. But do you know what percentage are over

(1:34:01) represented? Probably by quite a bit. Yeah. Like we're talking I think I think

(1:34:07) in education 75% of all the degrees in education go to women. In the humanities, it's in the

(1:34:13) high 60s. Uh, psychology, I think it's in the 70 percentile or above. In fact, I might have a graph handy.

(1:34:20) Um, let me check my file here, but I think I actually might even have

(1:34:26) uh, yeah, so in the social sciences, it's Oh, man. For psychology,

(1:34:33) uh, by 2018, almost 80% women. Social sciences.

(1:34:38) I think that, uh, almost Oh, hang on. almost 60%. Uh-huh. Right. Uh economics, that's driven by

(1:34:45) men, right? Uh if we're looking at uh education, 75%

(1:34:51) plus go to women. And these women when they're pulled, Pew Research has done

(1:34:56) some pretty good polling on this. They're pulled out as being progress. They identify as progressive. They vote

(1:35:02) Democrat. So, they're definitely in charge of this system. Why shouldn't I be enraged at progressives and how

(1:35:08) terrible they're doing inside of this system when they're in charge of it? I mean, they almost have unilateral control. They have a huge budget,

(1:35:14) massive budget, the biggest in the world. Yeah, I would say that. Um, well, not everyone

(1:35:21) with a humanities degree goes into into education. Yeah. But people with degrees in

(1:35:27) education usually do. And 75% women progressives, right? Certainly. Yes. But I don't think that

(1:35:33) necessarily having socially progressive ideals uh you know translates to having

(1:35:39) um fiscally progressive ideas. Uh well they got the biggest budget ever. They got the biggest budget ever. They

(1:35:45) they're massively paid distributed. I mean the teachers are the ones getting the funding.

(1:35:52) I mean have you ever seen like like districts are not funded the same like poor areas are not funded the same way

(1:35:59) that wealthier areas are? I have attended school in a very poor area and I've attended school in a very rich area

(1:36:05) and the rich area was a lot better off. Yeah. But do you know that when we look at the stats the divides in these areas

(1:36:12) are not so wide as to be compensated by pure socioeconomic standards. Meaning

(1:36:17) that the reading comprehension levels in these rich areas is not so much greater than the reading comprehension levels in

(1:36:23) the poor areas as to be able to divide that purely by socioeconomics. There must be something else going on here.

(1:36:30) And the case of the matter is is like think of it from my perspective as I'm trying to think of it from yours.

(1:36:36) From my perspective, I think who's in charge of this education? Who's in charge of all of these programs which

(1:36:43) are designed to raise our kids? Who's in charge of all of this social justice? Who's in charge? Well, so I research it.

(1:36:50) Who is actually in charge of this? Well, it's progressives. They have a complete monopoly, in fact, on this. There's

(1:36:56) conservatives, in fact, who write whole articles about how terrible their time in academia was because almost nobody

(1:37:02) was a conservative. Now, that's anecdotal, but what we do have is hard facts. We know that the progressives are the

(1:37:08) ones in charge of education. We know that it's their ideology which is being propagated. We know that they're the

(1:37:14) most wellunded uh that they could possibly be. I mean, you even if you increase the budget by another what

(1:37:21) billion dollars, I don't think you're going to get any different results considering how bloated it already is.

(1:37:27) So, so why is it why is it that they can't raise kids to [ __ ] read? Like,

(1:37:33) why how could progressives be this bad at this? Um, I mean I would want to look at a map

(1:37:41) of like which which uh you know where

(1:37:46) literacy rates are the are the worst because again I do think that poverty

(1:37:52) will point to that. Um oh someone in the super jet said the entire story with the teacher salary is that it includes the

(1:37:58) administrators which is who is getting the money not the ones providing instruction. Prove it.

(1:38:04) Oh, that the the burn of that proof, I suppose, would be on the person that made that claim. Um, but again, is it

(1:38:10) not true that red states generally have like a poorer literacy rate and outcome?

(1:38:16) Red states also have and and which states have the largest minority population? The red states or the blue

(1:38:21) states? Blue states. No, the opposite. Largest black populations in Mississippi, for

(1:38:27) instance. The largest minority states are red states, not blue states. Look it

(1:38:33) up yourself. Uh, well, I mean, California, I think, is like 38% Latino.

(1:38:40) Yeah, but but look up look up for yourself. Do red states generally have more minorities than blue states?

(1:38:50) Let's see. The states with the highest uh minority

(1:38:56) population in the US are California, Hawaii, New Mexico, and Texas. Um, these are majority minority states. Um,

(1:39:04) Texas is a red state, right? Same. I believe New Mexico is as well.

(1:39:10) New Mexico is swing, isn't it? I think it I think it's pretty I think it's pretty comfortably than been in red

(1:39:16) state. But the point is is like take all of the red states and the highest concentration of minorities,

(1:39:23) you're going to find them in red states, not in blue states. California, and you're only going to find this because of how huge it is and how many people

(1:39:30) live there. Same thing with Texas. So Texas, uh, massive red state, right?

(1:39:36) Also filled to the brim with, uh, with Hispanics as well. But if you look at,

(1:39:41) uh, minority, yeah, they're they're mostly stationed in red states. Like look, just look up, for instance, black population. Look up the black

(1:39:47) population, red states versus blue states. Not even close.

(1:39:57) Well, yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'm corrected. It is a blue state. My bad. New Mexico in the south.

(1:40:02) Um, is your Yes, they're all located Yes, they're located in the south because during minorities have poorer like what is the

(1:40:10) what's the what's the goal here? Well, I'm pointing out to you that what what you were trying to kind of make the

(1:40:17) association that um you know somehow in the poorer

(1:40:22) states, right? Um, that's the problem is that it's a it's a it's an idea of uh

(1:40:28) poor versus rich. What I'm looking at is like it seems like it's an idea of

(1:40:33) minority concentration versus non- minority concentrations where you see the higher standards here and why you

(1:40:39) see such a massive disparity in these things

(1:40:44) uh with with educational standards. Yes.

(1:40:50) Um with I mean I also I do think that that

(1:40:56) socioeconomic status also plays a you know significant factor here and it is a

(1:41:01) fact that ethnic minorities uh specifically black indigenous and Latino

(1:41:07) populations are less welloff than white and Asian populations.

(1:41:13) Okay. Right. Okay. Right. So again, so then you should be able to see the

(1:41:20) same disparity in educational standards. Then if you took very poor white people

(1:41:25) and very rich white people and then you made the comparison, they should be about the same, right? And that's how we

(1:41:30) could adjust for these things. Uh well, I mean, if you look at like wealthy states that have a lot of white

(1:41:36) people tend to have uh better educational standards than states with a lot of poor white people,

(1:41:42) like Appalachia for instance. Yes. which has like horrendous uh you

(1:41:47) know horrific education. Yeah. Right. But if we were to take the compensation let's say

(1:41:53) very poor white people versus very rich white people and we saw the disparity there in

(1:41:58) education I would agree with you that that exists right? Yeah. Okay. But shouldn't that exist on par

(1:42:06) then in the same if it's purely socioeconomic we should see that the rates of uh of

(1:42:13) you know like poor minorities is ex is about the same when it came to literacy rates mathematics things like

(1:42:20) that right but we don't that do you think poor white children

(1:42:25) perform better than poor black and brown children yes do we know this for sure Look it up.

(1:42:34) Look it up for yourself. Look it up for yourself. Um I do need to pee.

(1:42:40) Go ahead. I can look this up while I am peeing. I'm It's It's just It's just I mean it's objectively true. Yes, they

(1:42:46) do. Okay, that's fine. I'm going to I'm going to go pee and I shall be right back cuz I'm about

(1:42:52) to piss myself. I have just a water bottle. I'll be right back.

(1:42:58) And while she's stepping away, folks, I'm very disappointed. There are 635 of

(1:43:03) you watching over at least on my end. And there's only 285 likes. I'm very, very disappointed. I'm calling all of

(1:43:09) your mothers and I might even go as low as calling your fathers. So, hit the like. Do your job. Andrew, a lot of the

(1:43:17) chat is very surprised how um calm you are this evening.

(1:43:23) Well, I invited her to have a conversation. If I'm here to have a debate, I have a debate. If I'm here to

(1:43:28) have a conversation, I have a conversation. It depends on what the opposition wants to do. Sometimes you can convince people of your position

(1:43:35) easier by uh having a general discussion with them. But my job when I come into a

(1:43:40) debate is not to be your friend and not to be your pal and not to be your buddy. My job is to completely destroy your [ __ ] worldview and beat you over the

(1:43:46) head with it and then replace it with something better. But I do think that one thing I can do in these

(1:43:53) conversations is show the contrast. I believe the things I believe because they're wellinformed.

(1:43:58) Mhm. Now, I was wrong on New Mexico, by the way. It is a blue state. My bad. But

(1:44:04) the point is the point is though is like almost everything that I'm saying, I'm h actually having her Google it in real

(1:44:10) time to confirm it. You know what I mean? I'm I'm not saying the things that I'm saying because

(1:44:15) they're [ __ ] crazy. I'm saying the things I'm saying because they're true. How do you remember all of this stuff?

(1:44:23) Alcohol. [Laughter] it. Uh I mean I was never very good at

(1:44:31) uh retaining information. I was never good at uh history class to say the least. Uh because it's like retaining

(1:44:38) retaining information in and of itself like statistics, numbers or you know things just goes in one ear out the

(1:44:44) other and I only remember what I have to in the moment. But when it comes to uh concepts, you know, I can I can really

(1:44:51) grasp hold of that because it has something to cling on to. But all of these numbers you throw out all the time

(1:44:56) just uh kind of throws me off a lot because I'm thinking like how do you know this? Like just constantly numbers

(1:45:03) everywhere. Yeah. Well, I mean it's it's just part and parcel of being informed. So anyway,

(1:45:09) my the point Okay, wait. I'm I'm back. I did just look it up. So apparently um

(1:45:15) poor white children uh are less likely to attend high poverty schools versus

(1:45:22) poor black children. So about actually I've also considered a link. It's um I

(1:45:28) think actually I agree with this. I'm not even going to dispute it. Black children uh that are poor are

(1:45:33) likely to uh like as in they they are on like free lunch programs. Sure. um 81.1%

(1:45:40) of them will attend high poverty schools whereas white children who are at the same socioeconomic status will attend

(1:45:46) high poverty schools at about 53.5%. So agreed. Again, we see like a disparity there

(1:45:51) where um you still have the same problem though. You just all you do is just take it one step further, right? So okay, but out of

(1:45:58) the white children who go and are in the poverty situations on par in the poverty schools with the other students who are

(1:46:05) not white, you should still see similar rates and you still don't. This is the problem. Do you have a study for this by any

(1:46:13) chance? You can just Google that too. Actually the social the social disparity. So this

(1:46:18) is this is one a very wellre or wellstied phenomenon. Now I I think that the reason for this

(1:46:25) one thing that I would point to because I'm sure that you're pointing or you're thinking in your head that this is somehow a racialist view. It's still

(1:46:31) not. I think it has to do with intact family units. So especially in the black

(1:46:37) community uh where there's it's it's almost um a centralized thing now to

(1:46:42) have fatherless homes. And when I go back in time, that is, well, hang on. When I go back in time

(1:46:49) and I look at the early 1900s and I look at black communities when they had intact father homes, you did not have

(1:46:56) the same issues inside those communities you do now, right? Do you know why there is a uh

(1:47:03) disparity in intact family homes? For what? For black for you. You know

(1:47:10) why there's a difference? Yeah, I think it's because uh Margaret Singer and a

(1:47:15) whole lot of people infiltrated uh black churches and began the divisive message

(1:47:21) for progressivism. And then later uh especially under I think it was Nixon uh

(1:47:28) this got wider when uh rep when blacks used to be basically all Republicans and

(1:47:33) still are very social conservative and you see this deviation divide uh from basically Sanger on uh as uh it started

(1:47:41) with the black churches though and that was basically what she said she was going to do was that she was going to

(1:47:46) utilize black churches. more likely that maybe like mass incarceration is kind of

(1:47:52) a kind of an issue. It didn't used to be an issue. Mass incarceration. When do you think

(1:47:58) that that began? Uh the mass incarceration of uh blacks specifically, you'd start from like the

(1:48:04) late 60s on is when you really started to see that, especially when the crack epidemic started happening. Um that uh that

(1:48:12) really exploded incarceration rates, but it was not always the case. Right? They

(1:48:18) did always go to jail at a higher rate. That's true. U but maybe you would expect to see that from socioeconomic

(1:48:24) conditions, right? But ultimately the idea here is why is it so overwhelmingly lopsided?

(1:48:31) It's because any any place you look where there's fatherless homes, you see the same types of behavior regardless of

(1:48:38) the color of the children. Almost universally, this is true. Right? So if a specific community uh is

(1:48:46) being subjected to you know mass incarceration at a greater rate than another community and people are trapped

(1:48:54) locked in a cycle of this I mean then you would see the difference that you

(1:48:59) are observing correct so it is not like a fundamental that is but that would be a correlation for the

(1:49:04) root right so what's the root what's the root for why black people are incarcerated so much more progressives

(1:49:11) claim racism. I claim that that's stupid. I don't think it's racist that a guy stealing your TV and he gets locked

(1:49:17) up or it's racist that a guy murders somebody else and so they get locked up. Well, for the same crimes, the same

(1:49:22) crimes, uh, black people are far more likely to serve time versus they're more likely to serve more time

(1:49:29) that not time, but more time. If that's the case, white people are still going to jail for crimes, right? It seems to

(1:49:36) me that not committing crimes equals not going to jail. That seems to be the universal. Like for instance, Asians,

(1:49:43) right, don't commit a lot of crimes and so they don't go to jail very often because they just don't commit crimes,

(1:49:49) right? They haven't been subject to the same kind of I think uh systematic

(1:49:54) disenfranchisement as um black. Not to the same degree. It's a it's a different

(1:50:00) scenario. Yeah, maybe. Would you would you a different scenario? Yeah. But the thing is is like we have a

(1:50:07) historic standard we can go off of for black America, especially under Martin Luther. Martin Luther King, who was a

(1:50:13) Republican, by the way. Most black people were Republicans in this era. Yeah. Look it up. Martin Luther King was

(1:50:20) a Republican. Yes. Uh he was not a Republican. His father

(1:50:26) was. Yes, he was. Yes, he was. Martin Luther King Jr. uh avoided formal affiliation with either the Democratic

(1:50:32) or Republican party. [ __ ] He did not. That's not true. Well, I just I just looked at He's a He was pretty noted actually as

(1:50:39) being a Republican. The official answer is neither. Neither. Uhhuh. Yeah. He was He was He

(1:50:45) was very much very much, you know. And by the way, blacks were always in the Republican camp. They they switched

(1:50:51) basically under Nixon, I think, if I remember correctly.

(1:50:57) Um Well, I mean, I don't know much to comment about that. Yeah. But anyway, but but yeah, the

(1:51:02) point is is like look these these guys the Republican the the Republicans and Democrats did they not switch platforms?

(1:51:09) Not no they didn't completely switch platforms. You're talking wasn't that the cuz Republicans were the party of Lincoln. Correct.

(1:51:16) Still are the the party of Lincoln. This grand old party, right? But there was like a uh there was

(1:51:22) a there was a a difference. There was a switch. Yeah. So like somewhat people in my chat are

(1:51:28) saying that they switched platforms around the time of didn't completely switch. They didn't completely switch

(1:51:33) platforms. That's nonsense. So, the thing is is like that can be traced to one newspaper article, by the

(1:51:39) way, that made that claim. They didn't completely switch. No, it is true that Republicans have become

(1:51:45) much more of uh inclined towards the grassroots of America, whereas Democrats used to be more towards the grassroots

(1:51:51) of America. They used to be the protectionists and things like this. There are some things that they have switched on. I grant that that is true,

(1:51:58) but they didn't switch completely. Not only that, the the main thing to focus on though is what changed inside of this

(1:52:05) community. What was the biggest change that happened when he used to have some of the most conservative people on

(1:52:11) planet Earth in the black community and they're not anymore? It's because of the change in um having a matriarchal versus

(1:52:20) a patriarchal social system. Meaning that black women now run the home and not black men because black men are not

(1:52:26) present. Well, that's also kind of I mean that's a complicated history, but that's also kind of a kind of a thing

(1:52:33) that has to do with um you know continued disenfranchisement and poverty

(1:52:39) and again mass incarceration. Like of course women are going to be the breadwinners if the Yeah, but I would argue that the mass

(1:52:44) incarceration happens for the same reason that it happens under children of

(1:52:50) single moms who are not black. Their rates greatly increase for incarceration as well. I don't think it's the cause of

(1:52:57) mass incarceration that causes fatherless homes, but rather it was the cause of fatherless homes that led to

(1:53:02) mass incarceration. That's my argument. That's that's the way that I would view it. Disagree entirely. I mean, I show the

(1:53:09) timeline the uh the timeline of fatherless homes in black in the black community. Yeah.

(1:53:15) When did when did it become And by the way, you can actually look at the same timeline with white

(1:53:20) communities. You can look at the same exact timeline. You can look at the same exact uh

(1:53:26) outcomes for whites who grow up in fatherless homes. They have terrible outcomes and it's an everinccreasing

(1:53:33) rate of terrible outcomes for these people. Would you Yes.

(1:53:38) Oh, sorry. Would you say that there's um like you know other factors um like if they live

(1:53:44) in poverty, inner city, rural uh suburbia like are there other factors

(1:53:50) that incorporate into that statistically? Yeah, of course. There's also the look,

(1:53:56) I wouldn't ever I would never argue that especially post civil war, there was not

(1:54:01) significant disadvantages for blacks, especially in the South. This is well known. Nobody's going to ever make the claim

(1:54:07) otherwise unless they're just completely historically illiterate or that racism didn't exist towards blacks, especially

(1:54:13) in the South and even in the North. It definitely did. And this is post civil war and that it takes a long time for a

(1:54:19) culture to catch up. I'm not even disputing that. What I am disputing is that the progressive ideology which

(1:54:26) moved in and cut off the idea of the black American father from his children

(1:54:31) is what led to the crippling of the black community and mass incarcerations, not mass incarcerations leading to

(1:54:38) fatherless homes. That's absurd and the historic standard does not support that. Well, I mean, why would why would

(1:54:44) fathers just leave is the thing. I mean, I I'll grant you that it is likely a

(1:54:49) complex issue, but I do think that uh blaming it primarily on cultural

(1:54:54) issues is is incorrect because it started with the church. Fathers are I'm going to tell you I'll

(1:55:00) tell you the history. It started with the church and it started with the infiltration of feminism into the church. You can look up a famous

(1:55:06) Margaret Singer quote. what she what her entire plan was was to send uh various

(1:55:12) birth control advocates into especially black churches because she wanted to kill black people. Now the people

(1:55:19) dispute this. Oh, this is the Planned Parenthood woman. Yeah. Yeah. They say no. I'm aware of this. Yeah. They say no. Hey, no she didn't.

(1:55:25) Okay. But you can look up her quote on Aboriginals and what she said about Aboriginals which was that Aboriginals

(1:55:30) were the lowest form of life on planet Earth. That's what she believed. She called them something akin to weeds. be

(1:55:36) but birth control would would lead to it's not the birth control it's the division in the church patriarchy starts

(1:55:43) with the church the idea of having a head of household who is a man is a spiritual concept much more than it's

(1:55:50) negation of a or much more than it's a material concept the idea for progressives is that men and women are

(1:55:56) interchangeable widgets and that women are just as capable of being the head of household as men right the idea of the

(1:56:02) spiritual concept of this was destroyed inside of a black community. Well, I think if we both agree that uh

(1:56:11) like historically black people were not allowed to live in the same areas and were kind of relegated to poorer areas

(1:56:18) intentionally. And if women up until somewhat recently had less opportunities

(1:56:25) to make money, then yes, like a single black mother family household is going

(1:56:32) to be poorer. and thus, you know, be more likely to raise children that may

(1:56:37) engage in crime because poverty correlates with crime and crime correlates with poverty. It's the same

(1:56:43) thing. People typically commit crimes because they are poor. So, what does that have to do with

(1:56:49) fatherless homes? So, if a father goes to jail,

(1:56:55) Yeah. and is thus, you know, making a home fatherless because he's in jail.

(1:57:02) Then he'd have to show that the incarceration rates, right, are what led to the fatherlessness, not the fatherlessness

(1:57:08) leading to the incarceration rates. That's the problem that you have here.

(1:57:15) Yeah, I feel like I if you have any further reading on this, I would be I would be

(1:57:20) just all you have to do is look at the early 20th century prison stats and what you saw in the in the uh

(1:57:27) disparity, the crime disparity. It's true that there was still a crime disparity, but it's not nothing nothing

(1:57:33) at all like it is today. It's not even in the same universe. Okay, these places, these big automotive capitals

(1:57:40) like Chicago, things like that, these places were not always war zones. Detroit was not always a war zone.

(1:57:45) Chicago was not always a war zone. There were not always just 20 [ __ ] people getting shot per weekend in these

(1:57:52) black areas. I mean, that had that's a reasonably and relatively new phenomen of of of segregation, which led

(1:57:59) to higher policing. And I think more aggressive and higher policing leads to to more crime and aggression, doesn't

(1:58:05) it? Yeah, maybe. But whether whether or not you can give me coralates for what would

(1:58:11) explain the disparity in in criminal activity between blacks and whites in the early 20th century, it would not

(1:58:18) negate the fact that the overwhelming explosion of of uh black culture and

(1:58:24) fatherlessness, that would not give a descriptor for that. The amount incarcerated does not reflect the amount

(1:58:31) of fatherless homes from the non-incarcerated. So we would have to have some different reason for that.

(1:58:37) Is there a it's the same level of fatherlessness amongst incarcerated and

(1:58:43) poor and incarcerated fathers versus employed black fathers? It's higher. So the idea here is it's

(1:58:50) actually higher employed non-felenon non-felen fathers. Black fathers

(1:58:57) I don't understand what you're asking me. Let me make sure I understand what you're asking me here. What is the what is the difference in fatherlessness when

(1:59:04) in black families when um the father grew up uh again has like a job and

(1:59:12) hasn't been incarcerated versus incarcerated and doesn't have a job. Yeah. But this goes so this goes back to

(1:59:18) my point. I would even grant this but that that black person likely had a a

(1:59:24) father at home. That's the thing. That's how we can trace this back. Right? So if the idea here is this,

(1:59:31) right now if you look at single motherhood by choice in the black community, meaning they get knocked up,

(1:59:38) right, without by just a boyfriend, unmarried, this type of thing,

(1:59:43) that is choosing that life, right? Um I mean I think like

(1:59:50) yes, but I think that you also have to look at who is uh knocking them up because there's some fathers that you

(1:59:56) would not want around. Correct. Who's making that choice?

(2:00:01) Well, the woman to get pregnant. Yeah. Which is why I advocate it's not unilateral. It's not It's not a unilateral thing, right? The woman is

(2:00:08) making the choice to get pregnant by these men. If that's the case, the woman's making the choice to get pregnant by these men, but not choosing

(2:00:14) to have the father there, right? That leads to disparities and outcomes.

(2:00:20) Begin immediately or does it happen over time? Because mostly happens immediately. So now we're

(2:00:25) just we're just talking about unmarried women who have children out of wedlock who who their boyfriend isn't living with them. The rates in black the black

(2:00:32) community are skyhigh for this sky where they they have they have the child and the father is not in the life from

(2:00:40) the beginning. Yes. From the beginning. Okay. I would again I'm I am curious. I

(2:00:46) would like to see some links on this because I feel like this is a complex issue

(2:00:51) and I think that boiling it down to culture is kind of uh

(2:00:58) yeah you want an external reason but the thing is is like education is not going to be able to give you the external

(2:01:04) reason because the disparities there are not easily explained unless you use a racial paradigm which is why so many

(2:01:10) people do. I don't use a racial paradigm. I think it's silly and I think that descriptors in society

(2:01:16) are much easier to come across by behavioral standards. If I look at what happens to uh white

(2:01:23) people and Asian people and every other dynamic if they're raised in a fatherless home,

(2:01:29) the outcome is completely negative in comparison to children who are raised in

(2:01:34) a home with a father. So if you have one community where the father the fatherlessness rates is higher than any

(2:01:41) other community, why would I not correlate that as being a primary issue? I would.

(2:01:46) Yeah, it is it is absolutely an issue, but I think that the issue the issue is more external than cultural. I mean I

(2:01:53) think that you just think that they're getting locked up and that's why they're fatherless. But that's not the case.

(2:01:59) I mean it's not the case that it's because they're getting locked up that they're fatherless. like that would not account

(2:02:05) for how many black women are single mothers uh based on the incarceration

(2:02:11) rates of black men. It just wouldn't account for how many of them are single just incarceration. But again, I

(2:02:16) think it is like just uh frankly significant setbacks compared to white

(2:02:22) and Asian communities. What setbacks prevent you from being a dad?

(2:02:27) I would say uh economic setbacks, more incentivization to that just means you

(2:02:33) can't and get involved in in crime. What that leads back to incarceration like what would stop you if you're not

(2:02:40) incarcerated from being a part of your child's life? What I mean wouldn't uh

(2:02:47) because those rates are still skyh high. Is it not true that um families uh that

(2:02:52) make more money are more likely to be intact versus families that make very little money?

(2:02:57) Marriages? Yes. But well, usually because there's a correlation between

(2:03:03) money and education and highly educated people tend to stay together for longer. That's true,

(2:03:09) right? So if people like again don't have the same access to education and

(2:03:15) are going to you know schools in shitty areas that are poor then we should see the same rates of

(2:03:22) poor people having the same amounts of fatherless homes. We don't see it with Hispanics. We don't see it with other

(2:03:27) groups. We see it with this specific group because this specific group because of the the Catholic influence

(2:03:33) because the culture exactly you're talking about then that's cultural, right?

(2:03:38) Sure. Yeah. Yeah. So you're you're just making the same argument that I am that this is a cultural that these are cultural things

(2:03:45) and it's the cultural things that develop into the ideas of fatherless homes. Remember I told you at the

(2:03:50) beginning uh patriarchal systems are spiritual. They start with the spiritual right you

(2:03:57) point to a high rate of fathered homes and and point to the same thing I am. They're Catholic. I would point to the

(2:04:03) same exact thing and say yeah this is a spiritual idea. And that is one of the

(2:04:08) things which keeps that those families intact. Right. Right. But it's also I think you know

(2:04:14) relates back to the capacity for Hispanic fathers to take care of their

(2:04:20) families whereas I feel like black have not been afforded the same well opportunity. I mean, I don't think

(2:04:26) that we can deny that that when black people used to be much more Christian in Christian churches, they

(2:04:32) had the same cultural influence Hispanics did where they they had a push

(2:04:37) from the community to take care of their children. Who wrecked all that? Well, you guys did. You progressives did. The

(2:04:44) anti-religious. I don't know if Margaret Singer could be considered a progressive if she was extremely racist. Um,

(2:04:52) what the listen, you think that being a progressive excludes you from racialism?

(2:04:58) I don't think so. And not only that, I mean, I think that if you're I think that we would

(2:05:06) I I I don't think it's socially progressive to be racist. So, let's say that you had every single

(2:05:11) progressive ideology in your head plus racist. You're not a progressive anymore.

(2:05:18) So, does the only thing Well, if it is the case that the only thing that makes you progressive is not being racist,

(2:05:24) then I'm a progressive and Sarah's a progressive and my chat's uh progressive and

(2:05:30) I would differentiate between socially and fiscally progressive ideas. Okay. So then, so then you could be a

(2:05:35) progressive and be racist then, right? I think you could be fiscally progressive and racist. Sure.

(2:05:41) Why couldn't you be socially progress? So if I had every social idea you had plus racism, I'm not a progressive.

(2:05:48) Uh I mean I think that views are a bit more complex than that. But if someone was very much super racist to the point

(2:05:54) of being like we need less black people in the world, they need to reproduce less. I mean that's that's pretty severe. Would you not agree? And mind

(2:06:02) you, I do understand that the roots of the feminist movement in the US are uh fairly white supremacist in nature.

(2:06:10) Um, and so hang on. I I wanted to give you uh real quick these stats, okay? The the average black man in the United

(2:06:16) States uh risks a 20 to 28% chance of incarceration at some point in their life.

(2:06:22) Okay? The rate of out of wedlock burst in the black community in America is 70%.

(2:06:27) And the percentage of black children living without their biological father at home is estimated to be at 50%. Now,

(2:06:32) let's look at the incarceration rate again, 28%. 70%

(2:06:38) of fatherless or fatherless homes, black children living without their biological fathers estimated to be at at least 50%,

(2:06:44) and the ones who are born out of wedlock at 70%. So there's no incarceration rates cannot account for this

(2:06:50) phenomenon. But then we talked about how this is again like there's a there's a root to it here.

(2:06:55) Yes. I don't think again what could the root be other than the culture.

(2:07:01) What could it even be? Economic. I mean, culture is does not just

(2:07:07) if it's economic, then why aren't Hispanics in the same rate of fatherlessness? They have the they have

(2:07:12) similar rates of economic disparity. In fact, sometimes worse so. Mhm.

(2:07:17) How could that be? Well, again, it's because the uh the factors impacting Hispanics versus black

(2:07:24) people were different in American history. What about right now? At this very moment, I would say uh yes,

(2:07:32) it's uh generally many Hispanics are immigrating from very very very again

(2:07:38) culturally conservative religious um but are also again not

(2:07:44) so how how come we can't account for the same thing in religion then when it comes to black people when they were heavily religious they were not they

(2:07:51) were not engaging in the same rates of fatherless behavior same as Hispanics. Doesn't that seem like the strongest

(2:07:57) correlation we can make here? Like, could you even come up with anything stronger that would correlate? I do believe that uh the Black Family

(2:08:04) Union has been intentionally uh disrupted by progressives.

(2:08:10) I wouldn't say by progressives. I mean, well, they're they're the ones who are the ones trying to eliminate religion

(2:08:17) the the freaking crack and [ __ ] into the uh into black communities. Yeah. They're not the only community

(2:08:23) which has ever had an introduction to an intoxicant like opium which heavily affected heavily affected

(2:08:32) not just whites but Asians as well right they're not the only disaffected group

(2:08:37) which has ever had an introduction of a drug which uh which had a crippling effect and then as a group got past that

(2:08:45) crack is not the the epidemic now that it used to be and would not explain in

(2:08:50) any way shape or form term the the huge disparity between incarceration and fatherless homes as an explanation. And

(2:08:57) this is why I've always been baffled by this. I can literally track for you

(2:09:02) exactly when it is that progressives began to move into black churches in

(2:09:08) order to remove the idea the idea of the patriarchal system, which is what all

(2:09:14) black communities literally thrived on. That was how all of their communities worked. They were all patriarchal

(2:09:20) systems. The black men took no [ __ ] from anybody. Let me tell you, if you if you

(2:09:26) go back and you read how early black families and their dynamics were, black men weren't taking any [ __ ] from nobody.

(2:09:34) A [ __ ] nobody. Out of curiosity, uh it does seem that black Americans tend to report higher

(2:09:40) levels of religious involvement compared to white Americans. Um does that how can

(2:09:45) we, you know, explain the disparity then if it Yeah. So this is well this is actually

(2:09:51) really simple. Can anybody self ideals being a Christian? Certainly. Yes. But I do.

(2:09:57) So what would make you a Christian? Uh probably believing in the Christian

(2:10:03) God. Uh is that it? Like if somebody said I believe in the Christian God, but all

(2:10:08) the concepts of Christian ethics I reject. Would you consider them to be Christians? So would you want to look at church

(2:10:13) attendance? Not just church attendance but uh your participation in sacraments,

(2:10:18) your particip participation in the church community, your participation

(2:10:23) inside of Christian ethics themselves. Just a simple self ideans do tend to

(2:10:28) attend religious services more frequently than white Americans. So it's 47% versus 34%.

(2:10:34) Uhhuh. Um, which is uh again, so black people go to

(2:10:41) church more than than white people, which means that they are most likely more affiliated men or women with religious

(2:10:47) men or womenities. I'm going to look at men or women. Mhm.

(2:11:03) Uh, so this is just in general. Um, black

(2:11:09) women tend to report higher levels of religious commitment than black men, but this is also the same for white women.

(2:11:15) So across races, women tend to be more religious than men. Uhhuh. So it is the case that inside of

(2:11:22) the black community that if we I if we adjust for gender in this case sex right if we adjust for

(2:11:28) sex then we see it's mostly black women who are attending like liberation churches and they're attending

(2:11:34) non-traditional churches and things like this because those are the more appealing churches to women. The LGBTQ

(2:11:40) flag hanging uh churches are the more appealing ones to Protestant women. The men tend to go to the more traditional

(2:11:47) churches creating an even wider divide. So it is the case actually that it's black women who are going to these

(2:11:53) churches more often than the black men. Therefore that again the idea of traditional patriarchy gone, right?

(2:12:00) Whereas if you're talking about Catholics, they go as a family. It's going to be mommy and daddy. Uh not the

(2:12:06) case when it comes to the black community. And you you uh you pointed out something there that's actually key when it comes to white people. It's the

(2:12:13) same thing here. You see a disparity in traditional church attendance between white men and white women. White women

(2:12:19) do go to church more. That's true. But what kinds of churches do they go to? That's the key.

(2:12:25) Um I'm fairly certain that uh because I have this statistic thrown in my face all the time as far as my support of uh

(2:12:32) racial justice goes. Um but are socially conservative attitudes not more commoned

(2:12:38) amongst black Americans than they are amongst white Americans? Yes. So it is true that especially black

(2:12:46) men, black men, they tend to be more socially

(2:12:51) conservative, but only here, not when it comes to voting and voting patterns. They tend to mostly only be

(2:12:59) socially ser conservative when it comes to homosexuality and immigration. That's it. Yes.

(2:13:05) Yeah. Especially homosexuality. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. I agree. It's still not cool to be

(2:13:10) an undercover brother. Okay. still not cool to be an undercover brother. But the thing is is like so what?

(2:13:17) The family dynamic of black America has been completely eviscerated and we can easily track this back from

(2:13:25) progressive ideology into modernity. I'm not taking away any of the arguments of

(2:13:30) racialism which came from whites especially uh in the early 20th century

(2:13:35) and even in the mid 20th century. I mean, do you think I'm taking away the idea prison system again?

(2:13:41) No, I think it has to do with the fact that progressives do everything to promote alternative family structures

(2:13:47) than the idea of mommy, daddy, children, c cross-g generational or nuclear

(2:13:52) families. Progressives do everything possible to destroy that unit. And it

(2:13:58) has be been the most detrimental thing to blacks. It is now becoming the most detrimental thing to whites. Look at

(2:14:04) just look at this. just just humor me with one thing. I I'm kind of someone that I feel like

(2:14:10) uh I I suppose cultural arguments are are less

(2:14:16) interesting to me. Um but they're the most important is is looking at where

(2:14:23) money, you know, Yeah. But don't you where is money going to and from? And so

(2:14:28) yeah, but money when we look at education is huge, right? When we when we have a a country in which the private

(2:14:36) prison system and labor from private prisons is uh kind of integral to our economy, like it would make sense that

(2:14:43) they would want as many people possible

(2:14:48) locked up. Correct. Like would it would it not follow that? I'll even grant it. I'll even a a

(2:14:55) specific population perhaps. I'll grant the entire thing. It does nothing to negate what I'm saying here.

(2:15:01) Even if it's the case that prison industries and private prisons who operate on a model of private

(2:15:08) capital per inmate, right, were influencing politicians for laws which disproportionately affected minorities.

(2:15:14) I'm willing to even grant that that is the case. And it still doesn't explain this disparity, not even close. And

(2:15:20) that's my problem. That's the issue. It's like the difference I think when I'm talking to you is that I can grant

(2:15:27) your worldview and it just affirms mine. But if you grant mine, it destroys yours. And that's the problem, right?

(2:15:34) It's like I'm I'm willing to engage in the entire think that economics uh economic

(2:15:42) like socioeconomic um standards can determine culture because

(2:15:48) again I do feel like this is this is something that I think culture determines external.

(2:15:54) I think culture I think it's the opposite. I think it's the opposite that culture determines the decadence of

(2:16:00) socioeconomic policy anyway that it I think culture is what influences the

(2:16:06) political process for the things that you're talking about in the injustices in the financial communities which

(2:16:12) didn't even used to exist. Uh even things like usery like here I'll grant you an easy one. payday loan centers and

(2:16:19) things like that. Super hyper predatory, especially towards blacks, towards

(2:16:24) Hispanics, and towards minorities in this nation. It's so over the top hyper predatory. I think that those people

(2:16:30) should be pulled out of those payday loan places publicly tred and [ __ ] feathered. That's how bad that is. Okay.

(2:16:39) Do I think that that sort of decadence can exist though if you if you had a

(2:16:44) culture uh which was a moral culture? I do not. No, I don't think so. Do you do you think that perhaps uh you

(2:16:52) know so for instance when my ancestors came to America they pretty immediately

(2:16:58) had the opportunity to build up ancest ancestral wealth. Now a black

(2:17:04) had the no they came here poor. Okay. How did they get here versus uh

(2:17:11) enslaved individuals? How did your ancestors get here? Who is going by boat? Who is going to have a better opportunity to build

(2:17:19) wealth? Someone who is enslaved or someone who can work? Yeah, but I I'll I'll even I'll even

(2:17:26) grant this. Okay, grant me that. it. So, it could be the case uh and and is the case likely

(2:17:32) that black that the black community, right, had like 50 or 60 or 70 or even

(2:17:38) 80, maybe even 100 years of recovery from the uh social distinctions which

(2:17:43) were made financially between the disparity of them and white people. It still wouldn't account for this.

(2:17:49) There's plenty of poor countries where the fathers are intact. There's plenty plenty of them, including Hispanic

(2:17:55) nations. that we ever got a uh you know 40 acres in a mule. So what we had after

(2:18:01) the end of slavery how does that account for this people never got their reparations

(2:18:06) how does that account for this though how does that account segregation how does this how does this account for that

(2:18:12) what I mean is how does it opport okay if we are granting that crime correlates

(2:18:18) with poverty and a lack of education I I'm willing to grant all of that but

(2:18:23) how does that give an accounting for in modernity the rampant disassociation

(2:18:30) and the destruction of the black family when it used to be that they were even poorer than they are now, but the

(2:18:37) fathers were still there. I need an accounting. I'm going to need to see I'm going to need to see like

(2:18:42) I just read you the stats, but you can pull up the graph right now. Just look at fatherless black homes 1900 to

(2:18:48) present and tell me what the stats say yourself.

(2:18:54) It's too poverty rates in black. No, not poverty rates. No, no, no. fatherless black homes 1900 2025 and

(2:19:03) tell me what they are to and while she's looking that up um

(2:19:10) I'll maybe go maybe five more minutes if you guys wanted to and then we could open the panel up for some further

(2:19:16) conversation if you want if you guys want to stay with this I'm it's your show. Um I do have one thing before we get on

(2:19:25) to um Can you read me the stat though?

(2:19:30) So, um I will say for poverty at least, uh black people have a record low of um

(2:19:38) record low record low, which is good. That's good. That's good. But they're still in the

(2:19:44) but the worst fatherless homes in history. So, tell me, what was the father rate in the early 1900s to now?

(2:19:51) Any graph will do. In fact, just do it easy. Fatherless rate black homes 1980s to present. Just do that.

(2:19:57) Sure. Okay. Father Liz Homer writes black families

(2:20:06) 20th century.

(2:20:16) Okay. Yes, it was after the 1960s. Um, yes, it was after the 1960s. And we have

(2:20:22) the lowest poverty rate for blacks like you just said that we've

(2:20:27) ever had. So your worldview does not account for this phenomenon. Do you see? Do you see what I'm saying? And do you

(2:20:32) see why I think progressivism is so poisonous? Like like uh economic and external

(2:20:38) factors that can impact culture. You mean the economic factors that they're doing better than they've ever done ever in history and yet still

(2:20:45) they're at the most 50s and the 1960s. Yeah. But they were, listen, if they're

(2:20:50) doing worse financially in the 1950s, but there's still more fathers in the home, how could that account for that?

(2:20:59) Uh, I think conservative morals of the time. Yes, I suppose I There we go. Yes, I

(2:21:05) agree. Because of conservative morals at the time, which would be heavily religiously oriented. And what I'm

(2:21:11) showing you, what I'm trying to show you is that as the progressives have made the push for secularism, as they've made

(2:21:17) the push for all lifestyles are equal, the very communities are trying to

(2:21:22) protect. You guys have destroyed you. You've destroyed them with this completely and do anything. However, it

(2:21:30) does seem like fatherlessness uh by all races and ethnicities has increased.

(2:21:36) Agreed. And what else has increased? Secularism. the number one correlate between the

(2:21:43) idea of the moral prism being completely relative or not to get divorced. I think that that also

(2:21:50) helped. Yeah. And who pushed that? Well, women I think that's

(2:21:56) Yeah. Secularist women. That's a net gain. How is this But how is this a better societ? Like how could you ever think

(2:22:01) that the society in which you you progressives have built is better? Like this society in which now you can get

(2:22:07) divorced whenever you want. There's no social duties, no social obligations, has led to complete and total

(2:22:13) fatherlessness in black homes. It's leading to fatherlessness in white homes. It's leading to uh like these

(2:22:19) dire horrible outcomes even though you get your GDP. Your GDP is higher,

(2:22:25) poverty is lower, but the family units destroyed like h how did this do any

(2:22:30) good for us? Um I would say as the uh I now I grew up in a motherless home um

(2:22:38) due to divorce and I would say that that was really good. That was a lot

(2:22:44) than my family staying together, you know. Um

(2:22:49) I mean you're not the thing is like not without going too deeply into my family. Look, it's anecdotal anyway. It's

(2:22:56) anecdotal anyway. But here's the thing. The number one father homes do really well, don't they? Actually,

(2:23:02) yes, they do. Do you know why though? They do. They do. They do great. Do you know why they do men can make more money?

(2:23:07) No. And I also think that men are less vulnerable than women, whereas I think

(2:23:12) women are more likely to It's because of strange men. It's because single moms bring strange me men

(2:23:18) around and they abuse the kids. That's why. Yeah, I'm I am absolutely inclined to agree. Yeah. So, how do you solve that problem?

(2:23:29) How do we solve the problem of how do you solve the problem of single mothers bringing strange men around and abusing their kids? How would you how

(2:23:35) would you adjust for that? What what would be the thing that we could point to that was going on before that solved

(2:23:40) that problem that we no longer have? Well, I think that we would have to do

(2:23:45) something about men's tendency to, you know, rape

(2:23:50) Oh, it's men's fault. Well, I mean like like you are capable. I mean, surely you would agree that the

(2:23:57) the the majority of perpetrators of like child sexual assault and rape in general are are male, correct?

(2:24:03) No. Well, that's true. It's like a No, it's not. It's not true. It's a it

(2:24:10) it depends on classification. So, when I look into these stats, here's what I see. I see that they will say things

(2:24:16) like non-penetrative sex is not considered rape. that they say that um

(2:24:22) things which would be considered assault by men are not considered assault by women. I do not agree with this and I

(2:24:29) can even give you my proofs. Right? Here's some of the the great proofs that I have for this. Let's start with this

(2:24:36) idea of sexual assault, right? Or what is considered the category of our the

(2:24:42) rword, right? What is the rword? What would you consider rword to be?

(2:24:49) Um, I mean, I don't really differentiate between I I do believe that when people say rape, they typically do mean uh

(2:24:57) penetrative assault with either a fallus or some sort of phallic object. So, do

(2:25:03) you see how it could be that so many women, even though I have stat after stat I can show you when college in

(2:25:09) college where men have reported that they've been assaulted at much higher rates by women than women by men, they

(2:25:15) declassify them because it's non-penetrative. Do I still consider that to be the Rword? I sure do. Just

(2:25:22) like you would. I'm inclined to agree. I Yeah. So, I don't believe that these I think that the stats by rain in these

(2:25:28) things, they're all categorically I've also never seen stats like that. I mean, have you ever looked Have you ever

(2:25:33) actually like tell me this have you ever I have actually done research on where did you look where did you look

(2:25:38) that was not a progressive think tank where did you look anywhere that was not a progressive think yes I can I want you

(2:25:45) to go right now to Honeybadger radio and on that Twitter account I will send you

(2:25:51) the link as I have it bookmarked I will show you study after study after study

(2:25:57) which shows that they changed the categories of what the rword word actually is when it comes to men versus

(2:26:05) women for non-penetrative. That's one. Two, the fact of the matter is is that

(2:26:10) men uh when they're assaulted, let me give you an easy example. If a man is sitting at a party and a woman, strange

(2:26:17) woman comes over and starts rubbing his arm or rubbing his shoulders, that's not considered essay, nor do they report it

(2:26:23) as essay, but women will. There's massive category differences here. And

(2:26:28) if you were to adjust for the reporting and everything which was considered essay on the opposite side, you would

(2:26:35) find out that no, I don't believe that men are these hyper predators. I've

(2:26:40) always thought that that was [ __ ] feminist talking points based on categorization in order for feminists to

(2:26:46) play the perpetual victim. Now, let me pull these stats up. has uh you know was

(2:26:52) primarily involved in gay communities throughout my lifetime um and has dated

(2:26:59) probably an equal amount of men and women. Uh I'm not saying that women

(2:27:05) cannot be predatory because I have experienced that. However, in terms of the degrees of danger and how likely men

(2:27:14) are to offend versus women, I will say that it is much more likely for men to

(2:27:20) to offend. Yeah, I don't think men are okay. Do you have a daughter? Yeah.

(2:27:26) Uh, are you more comfortable leaving her with a strange adult man or a strange adult woman?

(2:27:32) Uh, generally speaking, I'm not comfortable leaving her with anybody. Okay. But if you had to choose if you

(2:27:37) had to choose if I mean it would depend like if it was my best friend who was a male I wouldn't give a [ __ ]

(2:27:43) you know what I mean that wouldn't uh that wouldn't be of concern with me. Now you said a stranger right? Uh generally

(2:27:50) speaking I probably would default towards a woman. That's true. But however even if intuitively I might

(2:27:56) think this or be socially conditioned to this. It doesn't actually mean that their risk would go up even if I

(2:28:04) intuitively would do this thing. Do you see how that works? It is statistically more likely for uh

(2:28:10) men to I mean I will look at your sources because again I'm actually a significant I I have I have been a

(2:28:17) witness against a female rapist victim was male. Uh I I have gone to bat for this and I

(2:28:24) care about this quite a bit. I I do think that male, you know, male victims of sexual assault when the perpetrator

(2:28:29) is female are not taken seriously and I don't like that. So, this is not me being against that, but I do think it is

(2:28:35) statistically more likely for men. I don't think so. I think it's only statistically an assault.

(2:28:41) Yeah. And I can send you these stats. You can find them. They're posted by Honeybadger Radio. Great source of information, by the way. Goes through

(2:28:48) all of these. Uh so, we can start. This would be researchgate net publication 33

(2:28:53) uh through publication 37. Uh actually yeah I can send all of these to you. So uh it turns out it turns out

(2:29:02) that when we make adjustments for categorization this is not at all uh as

(2:29:08) cut and dry as it's made to sound and men are not. And here's the thing I can actually give you a a logical

(2:29:14) demonstration for this that I think that you would agree with. Do you agree that women generally are much weaker than men

(2:29:20) and so in a much more vulnerable position towards male aggression than the opposition?

(2:29:25) Yeah. Okay. So then you would agree with me then that men themselves are in a

(2:29:30) position where women are generally vulnerable in comparison to them.

(2:29:36) Yes. And so that you would agree naturally then that men could assault them uh because they're in that vulnerable

(2:29:42) position if they so chose to. And so that's likely the explanation for why that happens because it's not like women

(2:29:48) can defend themselves against that, right? Yeah, I would I would agree. Yeah. So that makes sense to me. That's

(2:29:55) a great argument. The problem that I have is like when women are in charge of the infirm or they're in positions of

(2:30:01) authority, they kill their children. They literally kill their own children.

(2:30:07) And they also when they're in charge at like prisons and things like this with

(2:30:12) inmates, they're far more likely as a percentage to assault them. They're far more likely as a percentage when they're

(2:30:19) in a position of power to do horrible things to the infirm than men. So when

(2:30:24) the positions are reversed, in other words, if we So now if we make an adjustment for a strength differential,

(2:30:30) meaning now in comparison to me and you, I'm stronger than you. But in comparison to you and a nine-year-old, you're much

(2:30:37) stronger. When in the position of then them being the infirm and weaker ones,

(2:30:42) you guys assault at way higher rates. And I could just point to something easy like abortion. It's that simple. It's

(2:30:49) like when you're in charge of the people, those who are infirm and the children, and when you're in charge of

(2:30:56) those types of people, you kill them far more often than men do.

(2:31:02) You're referring to abortion. Yeah. That's right.

(2:31:07) Okay. Um All right. Uh

(2:31:12) I mean, I'm I'm not going to lie. I feel like you're going to have a hard time convincing most people of this argument

(2:31:18) that that women are far more likely to rape and assault than than That's not what my argument is. What's

(2:31:24) my argument? My argument is this. that if if you adjust women in the position

(2:31:31) of them then being the stronger sex, they assault more than men do. And we

(2:31:36) know this because we have them in the positions of the infirm versus men. And they assault them way more often and

(2:31:43) kill them way more often, especially same position than men in the same position. That's right. Okay. Do you have sources for that?

(2:31:49) Because yes, I Yes, I just told you what they were. You can go to I will and I will send them to you in the chat, please. Cuz I I would

(2:31:56) like to see these because I Hang on. I'm going to DM these over to um Sarah and she can put them in the

(2:32:03) chat for you. All right. And you can see these statistics for yourself. You can read through them right now live if you'd like to.

(2:32:09) Sure. It's not nearly. As soon as you start changing around categories, as soon as

(2:32:14) you start changing the semantics, which you guys hate so much, you start to realize, wait a second,

(2:32:21) this is not as cut and dry as we thought it was. This 90, you really think that

(2:32:27) 90% of sexual assaults are are are done by men? Like, you honestly believe that?

(2:32:33) Even intuitively, you believe that? Uh, yes. Yes, of course. Uh but that's based on

(2:32:40) my experiences again growing up as a as a woman. Um

(2:32:46) here Sarah I DM' this to you this link um if you can post it in the college or

(2:32:52) I'm sorry in the uh private chat. uh these would be uh multiple publications

(2:32:57) and multiple sources which give the demonstration and I mean many but I can

(2:33:03) back them up more with even more if you'd like because one thing that's interesting about this

(2:33:08) because I think this is going to be hard for you because essentially all evidence no

(2:33:13) disagrees with you when you look all perpetrators of of violence sexual or not. So this is a Twitter link

(2:33:20) that we have here which links which links all of those publications you just asked for

(2:33:26) looking. Okay. Oh, I see the postings.

(2:33:34) Uh 51% of college men report being essay or

(2:33:39) ared since the age of 16. 95% by women. Uh-huh.

(2:33:45) Over and over and over again. And we can Yes, that that makes sense that that college men are Yeah. being sexually

(2:33:54) assaulted by women, more likely heterosexual college men. Well, that's really strange. I thought men were these violent perpetrators and

(2:34:00) yet suddenly uh what what are the what is the conditional change? They're in college men are much stronger than

(2:34:06) college women. Therefore, college women would be in the position of vulnerability and yet men still aren't assaulting them. That's really weird.

(2:34:14) Um, I mean, I think it's most likely by by drugging and non-consensual groping.

(2:34:20) So, men aren't drugging women. Got it. No, they are. No, but the women are drugging them more. Uh, 43% of college men in high school

(2:34:27) youth report being sexually assaulted or raped. What would the statistics be for women comparatively?

(2:34:34) It gives you the comparison inside of that study. Okay. Well, let me go look at these. And then the second you begin to take them

(2:34:41) all into account, you realize that you the and I'm this is not even me

(2:34:46) trying to assault you. I just want you or or insult you. I just want you to understand something that's very important here. Right.

(2:34:52) I just almost everything that you believe from rain and these various groups

(2:34:58) is complete 100% semantic propaganda which is perpetuated by a feminist

(2:35:05) worldview of classification. They use classification as a weapon. It's really

(2:35:11) easy. If I only describe rape as being something a man can do to a woman, then

(2:35:17) 100% of rape is done by men, isn't it? Do you think that's the problem with classifications

(2:35:22) like this? Feminists created those definitions or do you think that that was 100% feminist in academia created it?

(2:35:29) Remember who is in charge of the social sciences? Women. Who has all the degrees in social sciences? Women. Who comes up

(2:35:36) with the categorizations? legal definition who comes up with the categorizations which inform the legal status of things.

(2:35:43) It's those people in academia. When you're talking about trans advocacy, they start when they move into law by

(2:35:50) sourcing psychologists, sociologists, and things like this in order to make the matter a matter of law. It's the

(2:35:56) same exact thing with rape. It's the same exact thing with all social phenomenons. Female academics come up

(2:36:02) with the categorizations and we're supposed to just be like, "Well, okay then.

(2:36:07) Don't you think that that's really bias and like [ __ ] horrible to do to men? Um, it's my understanding that

(2:36:13) historically uh largely the legal definition of rape came from a time

(2:36:20) before feminist movements typically because it would indicate that the property of a man and his daughter or

(2:36:26) his wife has been n uh that's historically that's historically

(2:36:31) inept. If this was the case that it didn't come from feminist, then let me just ask you a simple question.

(2:36:37) If a man wakes his wife up with his penis, okay, and she's dead in she's

(2:36:43) dead asleep, is he raping her? Um,

(2:36:48) I mean, I think that if they had not had a discussion, uh,

(2:36:54) no, they didn't have a discussion. It's their wedding night. It's their wedding night. He's dead asleep and he

(2:37:00) wakes her up with that penis. He wakes her up with that penis. That's what he does.

(2:37:05) Um I mean, yeah, I would consider that sexual assault. And same with And do you understand that? That is a

(2:37:12) categorization and classification for rape. That's brand new. Do you understand that?

(2:37:17) Yes. Rape is new. Yeah. The way that you Yeah. The way that you categorize is because

(2:37:23) Yeah. But do you now understand how important it is for these categories to be there? Like I don't consider that rape. That's insane. If my wife wakes me

(2:37:29) up with a [ __ ] I don't [ __ ] It's not a [ __ ] rape. Come on. How's that rape?

(2:37:36) Oh my god. Oh, no. Stop. But that's okay. I don't think we've ever had that

(2:37:41) discussion. Why would we ever need to have that discussion? She's my She's my property.

(2:37:48) She is owned by me. Blanket consent there. I think that that's fine. How do you know it's blanket consent if

(2:37:54) we've never had the we never had the discussion? Ask if presuming the wake up scenario,

(2:37:59) right? If if you wake your wife up with um fullon ready to go and you just start

(2:38:07) sticking it in and going for it and then if she says no, right, like then

(2:38:13) obviously, right, the consent is immediately. No, not always. Like here, I'll give you an example. It's the Bill Burr example,

(2:38:19) right? Oh, stop it. You're so bad. Knock it off. Oh god. Stop. Ah. When they

(2:38:25) don't really mean stop. And see, you see how the she she has this look on her face like I'm speaking in a foreign

(2:38:31) [ __ ] language as though she doesn't actually understand what I'm saying. When she does, she totally understands

(2:38:36) what I'm saying. And so does everybody else who's listening to me. Sex is a little bit mischievous. And sex is a

(2:38:43) little bit dynamic. And sex isn't always so cut and dry as like, "Do you see this

(2:38:48) piece of paper right here under line three? This means you can give me a [ __ ] between the hours of 3:00 a.m.

(2:38:53) and 4:00 a.m. and that's it. And if you don't sign right here, my consent will be revoked." That is not how

(2:38:59) interpersonal sexual dynamics work. And what always happens, hang on, hang on, let me finish, lady, let me finish. What

(2:39:05) always happens? What always happens with these people is they they give you the big eyes like they're stunned. You just

(2:39:11) said something stunning, Andrew. How could you say that when they totally [ __ ] agree with you? Totally agree.

(2:39:18) Like she knows sex is not so cut and dry as just no. Because that can mean all kinds of [ __ ] Depends on inflection. It

(2:39:25) depends on the interexual dynamics. And you know what that is? That big look. That's called cope. It's the cope of the

(2:39:31) eyes, right? It's cope. Pure cope. Just saying. I think that you're kind of

(2:39:37) misrepresenting um what marital rape laws are about. I don't think it's a

(2:39:43) playful [ __ ] from your wife. I think it's like the the brutal rape of a of someone.

(2:39:51) Oh, I think it's not. If we look at your categorizations, not only is it not that, but here's the biggest problem.

(2:39:57) The biggest problem is you can say in a court transcript, I said no. And the guy

(2:40:03) says, yeah, she did say no, but that's not what she meant. And we have no context for that because sex is a little

(2:40:09) bit mischievous and it's a little bit uh it's a little bit interpersonal and it really depends on the person's

(2:40:15) interpersonal dynamics and what that means. Like for instance, sometimes I like to go by my wife and give her a big

(2:40:22) hard open palm slap on the rear and she's like, "Ah, don't do that." She obviously wants me to not do it. I'm

(2:40:29) definitely going to do it again. And it's her distress that makes it so much fun to do. Right. That's part of the

(2:40:34) like mischievous nature of the thing, right? Is that consent? Is she retracting consent? Well, well, I guess

(2:40:41) she is. But does that really matter ultimately? Is that really what's going on there? It's not so cut and dry as you

(2:40:48) feminists make it out to be. And we all know that that's the case. And so what's so bothersome about it is like you go,

(2:40:54) "No, I think that marital rape is like the brutal penetration of your wife uh while she's screaming in agony." It's

(2:41:00) like that's not what they report though. what they report is like one time I said no and he went ahead and did it anyway

(2:41:06) and we have no context for the interpersonal dynamic and that's why categorization matters. That is that is

(2:41:12) uh if you say no when someone keeps going that is kind of

(2:41:18) that that would be considered rape by Okay. Well, I mean it's happened to me multiple times then with my own wife

(2:41:24) where she's like she's a little Randy at night and I'm like no I don't really want to. No honey I don't really want

(2:41:30) to. Nah nah. Oh okay. Well actually okay that feels pretty good. Okay. We're going to do this then. I mean you see

(2:41:37) what I'm saying. You know what I mean when I'm talking about No. I don't know what you mean. Like implicit consent and

(2:41:42) yeah, I don't know what you mean because it's not that cut and dry. Real life like is that playfulness? I meant it.

(2:41:48) Like I meant it. I really didn't want to right then. And then well, she talked me

(2:41:54) into it. Okay. Through touching that at that right right at that exact moment I did not want. But after the touching

(2:42:02) occurred, I realized actually I do want this and this is great. Hey man, I'm not going to lie. I don't

(2:42:07) know if I'm super into the idea of uh helping you determine whether you or

(2:42:13) your wife are raping each other or not. That's not the point. The point isn't whether like I'm not like super into here.

(2:42:19) Do you understand? Do you understand the point of categorization? It's just an offiscation. You're just offiscating.

(2:42:26) You're just offiscating man. Like my point is to show you that just based on normal human sexual dynamics, women like

(2:42:33) you will categorize things as rape that aren't. That's my point. Not whether or not uh Charlie Chuck over here thinks

(2:42:41) I'm raping my wife or she's raping me. It's to give you an easy contrast of normal human interactions and sexual

(2:42:47) dynamics that you could easily cone that aren't assumptions. You are making some assumptions about me right now that you

(2:42:56) know you if someone tickles me and I go he he stop. Do I think I am being if a

(2:43:04) friend or or a boyfriend or a girlfriend whoever tickles me and I go he he stop and they don't do I think I am being

(2:43:09) assaulted or raped maybe not obviously how does that read out on a court transcript uh cons

(2:43:16) I mean man I don't know I have never tried to take anyone to court for you

(2:43:22) know tickling and giggling and silly stuff and I can you engage the hypothetical I know

(2:43:28) how we got here from you saying that rapist Like, holy, that's not what

(2:43:33) that's not what happened. Like, all you're doing is trolling now cuz you have no answer to this. Human sexuality

(2:43:39) is complex and it's not so simple as you guys make it out to be. And when you make these kind of crazy

(2:43:45) to be that, man, but I think when we talk about marital man, we are No, I don't think we do know because

(2:43:51) categorizations matter. And if ever one time a woman has said no to her husband,

(2:43:57) right, and he admits that in court, yeah, she said no, but that's not a big deal. like we, you know, there's a whole

(2:44:03) interpersonal thing you don't understand here. They don't give a [ __ ] because they're going off of these categorizations. That's the point. And

(2:44:10) that's why it's so important. And you just go, I don't know, man. Like, I don't want to talk about your sex life stuff though, dude. It's like, no, I'm

(2:44:16) using it to draw an example parallel. Of a playful of a playful disagreement

(2:44:21) in a in a hundreds of them. In fact, I would have to see that.

(2:44:27) Yeah, I know you. But you but you've done a lot of in-depth research, haven't you? I've done tons of in-depth

(2:44:32) research, but I've I've never heard of a case like that. Anything like No, I've seen I've seen, you know, false rape charges.

(2:44:37) Absolutely. I've seen those made, but I have never seen uh you know, like lady

(2:44:43) playfully said, "He he stop." And then guy was, you know, convicted of of marital rape.

(2:44:49) How would you know though? Um how would you know that that was the case? If it is the case, the categorization in court is that she said

(2:44:56) no. you admitted to. She said, "No, he didn't stop." Even though that was against what their normal sexual dynamic

(2:45:02) is. And the court's like, "Well, now you're convicted." You could just point to it and say, "No, he's a convicted rapist. He was convicted in the court of

(2:45:09) law." Even if the categorization makes no sense in this context, that's why it's so important.

(2:45:16) That's why and you guys like like this is why every time I talk uh to you guys

(2:45:21) about this stuff somehow when we get to this point there's like a complete shutdown on the

(2:45:27) other side. It's like all logic and reason and interpersonal dynamics goes out the window because you just want to

(2:45:32) be devoted to this stat that men are monsters and we're just not. I think that you are just making I don't think that men are monsters by and

(2:45:38) large. I think that if it is the case that they're responsible for 90% of the grapes, how could you say that it's not

(2:45:45) monstrous? Like that's the question. I mean, I think Do you think every man is a rapist? I don't think so. I think

(2:45:51) most people do not commit rape. Let me ask you this. Okay. Do you think

(2:45:56) that you can have a form of rhetoric, right, where you are very evasive on the form of rhetoric where it can construe

(2:46:04) all men as being a bad thing, even though you don't necessarily say that, but you're definitely making a subtle

(2:46:12) and brutal implication that no, men are basically only responsible for this problem, not the opposite sex. And then

(2:46:18) when somebody challenge you, challenges you on it. And I showed you evidence by the way, significant evidence you can go

(2:46:24) through. And I'll give you even more if you want. The categorizations of these things are what matter the most because

(2:46:30) otherwise we can't really get to the heart of what the Rword even means. You

(2:46:35) say it's just, you know, it's aggressive penetration and that's what it requires. And it's like, but that's not what the law says.

(2:46:41) Uh, well, the first one that I opened said, all the majority of adult sexual crimes are committed by men against

(2:46:46) women. again are committed by men against women. Other forms of sexual assated

(2:46:52) against men are often ignored. It is estimated this is this is trying to raise awareness for uh an equally

(2:46:58) horrific occurrence. Do you understand why those are in congruence with each other? I

(2:47:04) have I have actually again I am someone who has you know made an attempt to get

(2:47:10) a female rapist in trouble because she sexually assaulted a man. That has nothing to do with I have done this before man. Like I am

(2:47:16) someone who cares a lot about that has nothing at all to do with the point. Even if you had locked up all of

(2:47:23) the female rapists who have ever existed on planet Earth, they would not in any way contend with this point that it's

(2:47:29) the categorization of what you consider these things to be in complete ignorance to normal human sexual dynamic which

(2:47:36) allows for these stats to show these things in the first place. That's the point that I wish you would contend

(2:47:42) with. I don't think that most of these things are talking about normal human sexual dynamics because again I am sympathetic

(2:47:48) to that point. What are you basing that on? I'm not. You are. You are making assumptions about me as a person that I am like

(2:47:54) someone that is like You just said it though. So, what are you basing it on? Needs like a sexual contract before I

(2:48:00) can engage in intercourse or I think that's not what I'm saying. I just I'm asking you what are you basing these

(2:48:05) things about me? I'm You literally just said I don't think I don't think X

(2:48:12) What are you basing that on? I mean, essentially, uh, all all sexual

(2:48:18) assault research out there does point to the fact that men are more likely to be perpetrators, but it but it doesn't it's all context

(2:48:24) specific and it's all dependent on how you make these classifications. Like, look, I'll I'll even demonstrate it for

(2:48:30) you easier. Okay. Do you agree that there's a massive deviation in how men

(2:48:37) and women perceive murder like um or even even men and men? I if if it's the

(2:48:45) case, for instance, that somebody's stealing my TV, but they don't look like they're violent, right, and I shoot them, would

(2:48:52) you classify me as a murderer? Uh, yeah. I think murder is pretty

(2:48:58) pretty cut and dry. Yeah. You you killed someone. So, I'm a murderer. Yeah. If you kill someone, you're a

(2:49:04) murderer. So, then I wouldn't No, I don't think so. So, I would classify murder as the unjustified killing of someone. That

(2:49:12) would be a murder. But killing would be a different category. So if it were the case that we went with your view,

(2:49:18) homicides could like quadruple overnight, right? Okay. But if you went with legal definitions,

(2:49:24) by any definition, homicide would would quadruple overnight by this

(2:49:29) classification. So if that whether legal or not, if that's your classification, that's your classification. So if it was the same

(2:49:36) thing with me and you went with my classification, homicides would reduce overnight.

(2:49:41) So, like, do you see why that's such an important distinction that you think I would be a murderer if I just killed someone, but I don't think you're a

(2:49:47) murderer if you kill someone. That's why it's so important that we have these categories, right? So, that otherwise I

(2:49:54) could easily say uh that many many many more people are murderers than actually

(2:49:59) are. I mean this is you know presupposing that women are responsible for for rape

(2:50:06) laws which I think is again the earliest laws against rape were made by men and I

(2:50:12) think your biggest opponents to you know differentiating between uh you know

(2:50:18) whether or not men are capable of being raped by women. Frankly this is anecdotal but my

(2:50:24) experience is that men are the most resistant to the idea that they are capable of being sexually assaulted by women. Okay. So, all of that what you

(2:50:31) just said is not historically accurate. When you think about even domestic violence laws, those were pushed by

(2:50:37) women's advocacy groups to give special classifications to women when the law

(2:50:42) already had laws about assault, including assault in marriages. But somehow women pushed for additional DV

(2:50:51) laws which they thought would be in somehow uh favorable to them when it came to domestic violence with the

(2:50:57) supposition that men of course were the perpetrators of most domestic violence. Well, guess what happened? What happened

(2:51:03) is now we have the stats, don't we? And it turns out that it's not so lopsided

(2:51:09) in domestic violence as we once thought. Now that we have all the stats and recordings, it turns out that women also

(2:51:15) commit an awful lot of domestic violence, especially with other women. Again, when they're in a position where

(2:51:21) they can where they're in authority and can harm people around them who are weaker than them, they seem more likely

(2:51:27) to do it than men do. I do. Yeah, I'm inclined to agree with you on that. However, uh, as far as that

(2:51:33) statistic goes, I do believe that was a survey on if people based on their sexuality had experienced domestic

(2:51:39) violence at all. I'm not talking about lesbians. I'm just talking about female roommates up there. If female roommates fight each

(2:51:45) other. Oh yeah. Happens all the time. I thought we were talking about marriage and relationships. But inside of marriage, it's the same

(2:51:51) thing, right? But you can have domestic violence calls for mom and daughter. You can have domestic violence calls for all sorts of things, right?

(2:51:56) Right. So, who is more likely to uh kill a man?

(2:52:02) What do you mean? Like, is a man or a woman more likely to kill a man? Well, sorry. Yeah. Women Women were more likely to kill

(2:52:09) men. Really? Yeah. They do it in the womb. Oh,

(2:52:15) okay. The person The person most likely to kill you if you are

(2:52:22) a woman is your the man closest to your mother. No, it's your mother. The w the person who's most likely to kill you

(2:52:29) if you're a man is your mother. And they do it when you can't even fight back.

(2:52:39) I can't honor this. Um I'm so sorry. I do I did have a question based on meta ethics. However, um

(2:52:47) based on our our because I think we got to move on from abortion and rape right now.

(2:52:53) Okay. Uh, out of curiosity, um, you know, we we talked a lot about whether or not

(2:52:59) morality is subjective, and I did actually read a fairly interesting article that I can share with you on it,

(2:53:04) but I did want to ask before we get into that, um, you believe that your

(2:53:09) Christian ethics are universal, but I wanted to, I guess, know how you, um,

(2:53:16) determine, uh, that's incorrect. They're they're plural. They're plur pluralistic.

(2:53:22) Okay. universal. Okay. So, we're going to get into some heady philosophy [ __ ] here if you want if you

(2:53:28) want to, but Yeah. Yeah. I'm interested. Yeah. So, when we're talking So, when you're talking about universal claims,

(2:53:34) right, you can have universal claims which are plur pluralistic, meaning there could be multiple ways to get to the claim. So,

(2:53:40) for instance, honor thy mother and father. Do you agree with me that you're going to do that differently in Japan than you

(2:53:46) are in the United States? Like taking your shoes off to walk in? Yes. Okay. So, but is that still a universal

(2:53:52) claim? Um, honor thy mother and father? Yeah.

(2:54:00) Uh, do you think that that's a universal claim right here that we could make in the US? No. Just is that a universal claim

(2:54:06) philosophically? Is it a universal claim you should honor your father and mother? Um,

(2:54:14) no. Okay. Well, then I don't even know how to proceed with a conversation then. So at that at that point, you're just

(2:54:21) denying what a universal claim is. And Oh, do you mean like are you just saying that this is like your your prescriptive

(2:54:28) like this is what you think people ought to I'm just asking you about universal claims. Not not not about So if you say

(2:54:35) like everyone ought to and everyone should and everyone Well, no, that's not what a universal

(2:54:40) claim is. What you're talking about there ought is normative. That's a normative claim. So normative ethics,

(2:54:46) that's ought should things like that. That's normative, right? A universal

(2:54:52) claim uh would not be a normative claim. So, this what I'm saying is like I'm not I'm not trying to be mean, okay?

(2:54:59) I'm just saying that in order to even have the conversation, you have to come at least equipped

(2:55:06) with with the basics or I I I feel like you're not even actually going to understand

(2:55:11) what what I'm saying, but I'm willing to humor it if you if you want to do it. Okay, that's fine. Um, so I guess but

(2:55:18) last time you just you did say that your morality was based on universal Christian ethics. So I suppose I was I

(2:55:24) was curious about that in the sense how do you determine what a uh universal

(2:55:31) Christian ethics is? Because if we look at it um historically obviously there

(2:55:36) are different uh you know Christian denominations that interpret the the

(2:55:42) Bible differently and the Bible is a translation of a translation of a translation. Agreed. So and it's also you know it is it is up

(2:55:50) to you as an individual if you are you know seeking a religion to determine which religion you you follow. Yep.

(2:55:57) Um how how could it be considered universal then? I suppose. Yeah. So um do you agree with me that

(2:56:07) not all universal claims or any claim is going to be equal to another claim? Meaning some are going to have stronger

(2:56:13) evidences for them philosophically. Some of Right. You agree with that, right? Sure. Yeah.

(2:56:19) Have you ever heard of a term called the impossibility to the contrary? Okay. So the term would just mean that

(2:56:25) we can rule if we rule everything else out except this thing, this thing's probably true, right?

(2:56:31) Mhm. Okay. So you can do the same thing when it comes to Christian ethics. You can rule out all forms of Christian ethics

(2:56:38) which would not fit within the paradigm of Christian ethics to show that that they cannot be true based on some

(2:56:44) philosophical problem which is within that ethical framework that ends up being either a contradiction or in some

(2:56:51) way uh doesn't logically follow to to end up with the impossibility to the

(2:56:57) contrary meaning that can't be true. And so what are we left with if we reduce all of these worldviews down? we have to

(2:57:03) reduce them down to the one that is true, the one that doesn't contradict. So in orthodoxy, we would have an

(2:57:09) ecclesiology, ecclesiastical authority and tradition, which would go from the teachings of Jesus Christ on. So we know

(2:57:14) exactly the right way to teach. We can reduce the contradictions from other denominations so that we can prove that

(2:57:21) those would be false within the paradigm of Christianity. Okay. Um but surely there are also going

(2:57:28) to be disagreements about what is like I'm I'm assuming that like ecclesiology and our ecclesiology

(2:57:35) accounts for that. Yes. So our ecclesiology allows for disagreements within the uh preponderance of Christian

(2:57:41) ethics and that's fine. There's nothing wrong with that. Uh when it comes to the core tenants there would be something

(2:57:48) wrong with that though. And what happens if you have multiple denominations which move away from core tenants when they're

(2:57:54) making universal claims? We can make falsifications of those claims. But but

(2:57:59) let me give you one even better. Mhm. Not only not only that, but let's assume

(2:58:04) like let's just assume this. Let's assume I'm [ __ ] wrong. Like 100% wrong. Christian ethics is total

(2:58:10) [ __ ] I believe in a sky daddy. I'm [ __ ] mentally ill. I'm a whack job. Right.

(2:58:15) I wouldn't say that. But yeah, but let's just assume it like just for the sake of the argument. Okay. from

(2:58:21) your paradigm, you couldn't actually tell me why that was problematic, except you just felt

(2:58:27) like it was. And so the the kind of distinction here that we're making with subjective versus

(2:58:34) objective claims, right? Mhm. I can concede my entire worldview to you

(2:58:39) as being false. And I would still if I made a claim like

(2:58:45) Andrew Wilson should be the king of America and put every homosexual to the sword. Let's just say that was the

(2:58:50) claim. Let's say you have nothing within your paradigm to say that that was morally incorrect

(2:58:57) other than because you felt like it was. So even if it was the case that you negated my entire worldview and

(2:59:02) ideology, ultimately who gives a [ __ ] Because your worldview reduces to the

(2:59:08) man with the might wins and that's it. And there's not a damn thing that your

(2:59:14) worldview can do to rebut that, rebuff it, or say a word about it because ultimately it's going to be the man with

(2:59:20) the sword who makes the rules in your paradigm. Even if I'm wrong, it still wouldn't matter.

(2:59:28) Um, so you better hope I'm right. You better hope I'm right because that's what keeps civilization at bay.

(2:59:33) Well, I think that that's just, you know, descriptive. I mean, there's certainly periods in time in which atrocities were

(2:59:41) uh deemed moral by many people, Christians included, like like during slavery. I

(2:59:47) mean, that was uh that was justified by many people for for many reasons.

(2:59:54) Yes. Um however, that doesn't mean it makes sense. But why were any of them wrong though?

(2:59:59) Um so based on the reading that I did, and I can share this article with you because it was incredibly interesting.

(3:00:05) Um, it's it's a long one, so it's gonna it's gonna just give me like the bullet points pages. Why do you think it's wrong? Why

(3:00:11) do you think it would be wrong for those people to have committed a genocide? Or even do you do you even think it's wrong?

(3:00:17) Uh, I mean, I I do think it's wrong, but this is the article is uh it is called

(3:00:24) the difference between ice cream and Nazis, moral externalization and the evolution of human cooperation by uh

(3:00:29) Kyle P. Stanford um published in the uh journal of behavioral and brain sciences

(3:00:36) in 2018. Um essentially what it gets down to is that compared to other

(3:00:41) intelligent uh mammals um human beings exhibit uh a lot of automatic

(3:00:48) cooperative tendencies. Um and so Stanford uh argues evidently this is the

(3:00:55) the source of morality where morality comes from. Why as human beings do we tend to develop um

(3:01:03) such a strong sense of of disgust towards people who

(3:01:09) do things uh who have different moral standards to us. There must be some reason for it.

(3:01:15) Okay. Um essentially that uh human beings let me find the exact quote. There was one

(3:01:20) that I wanted to find here. Um well take your time here. I'm I'm willing to listen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No problem. Um

(3:01:28) let me see. Uh so Stanford says um externalizing

(3:01:36) moral motivation was itself favored in ancestral environments precisely because it allowed pro-social altruistic and/or

(3:01:42) cooperative agents to more quickly, efficiently and effectively correlate their interactions and thereby take better advantage of the adaptive

(3:01:48) possibilities constituting our transition to a vastly more cooperative form of social life. So again my

(3:01:54) feelings are is that uh this tendency which we can observe in human infants

(3:02:00) which we cannot observe in like chimpanzeee or bonobo infants um this tendency to share even when it doesn't

(3:02:06) benefit us to want to work together. Um this this was a uh a trait that

(3:02:14) survived because it is the most advantageous. Okay. Um it is it is better for us as a

(3:02:20) species to to have this trait this this ability to empathize with each other and

(3:02:25) to develop a sense of morality to see things that are generally based upon uh

(3:02:31) you know harm being done to others and to disagree with it. Um that that is I guess you know the

(3:02:38) paradigm that I'm working with that is my moral framework is that I totally I actually totally understand.

(3:02:43) So to to kind of steal man this so that you know I understand your position here. Okay.

(3:02:48) It is the case that evolutionarily a trait carried over from into human

(3:02:54) beings modern humans uh pro perhaps from Neanderthalss or homoctus or something

(3:02:59) like this which caused cooperation and this cooperation creates a standard for

(3:03:04) humanity that seems to be better for humans. Is that is that essentially the

(3:03:11) position? Got it. Correct. Let's say we let's say we took that trait away. So that trait of cooperation is now gone

(3:03:18) and we just mercilessly kill each other for fun. We're still thriving as a as a

(3:03:24) species, right? But we often just like kill the weak. We just kill them. Hang on. Hang on. Let

(3:03:30) me ask let me ask let me ask the question first. We just kill them for fun because well there's no real reason

(3:03:37) that I can think of even if we're supposed to cooperate for things like eugenics and stuff like this to not be

(3:03:43) implemented because after all like let's take the Nazi uh tea program for instance they went through and they

(3:03:49) killed all the mentally ill people and they killed everybody who was an undesirable their society seemed to

(3:03:54) thrive from that. Why were they wrong?

(3:04:00) Do you believe uh German society was thriving from the the uh the elimination

(3:04:07) of disabled individuals? Well, I think that they would make the case that it was. Why were they wrong? Oh, certainly. Um they would absolutely

(3:04:14) I would say that uh I think that it is profoundly antisocial

(3:04:22) because the thing about specifically disability Yeah. But who cares if it's antisocial? Uh disability like this trait's gone

(3:04:28) now. The trait of cooperation is gone. And all the infirm people, we just put

(3:04:33) them to the sword. That's a trait that now carries over from evolution. If you're infirm, you just get put to the

(3:04:38) sword because it makes life easier for everybody else. Why would they be wrong? Why what would

(3:04:44) they be actually doing wrong if it's genetically inside of them as a carryover from evolution to do this

(3:04:50) thing? Uh I would say that um based off of uh

(3:04:59) Stanford's article and and my thoughts on it specifically,

(3:05:06) we have a tendency to select who we want to be around and it is people that share

(3:05:12) our morality and moral compass. Now, I would say that a society that does away

(3:05:18) with disabled individuals, while in the short term it may maybe save them money

(3:05:24) of some kind, the thing about disability is that it is inevitable for all of us,

(3:05:29) if you successfully make it over. Show me. Yeah. So, it's Logan's run.

(3:05:34) Past 40, done. The societyy's thriving. They got future

(3:05:39) cars. They got all the [ __ ] that they had in Logan's run. But you probably never seen Logan's Run. I'll give you the plot synopsis very quickly. Right?

(3:05:47) You hit X age and they just take you out. Okay? It's ultimate form of eugenics. They had

(3:05:53) flying spaceships and flying cars and [ __ ] like that and they just whacked everybody who reached a certain age,

(3:05:59) right? They didn't like them anymore. They're done. But their society seemed to be thriving.

(3:06:05) Uh I would argue that I don't think that a society would thrive. I think especially if you look at the evidence

(3:06:10) for I mean specifically the strides in in science I would say that people make

(3:06:15) after a a certain age I mean it could be take decades for people to to come to

(3:06:22) the conclusions that they will get to I generally believe that I value I'll grant that

(3:06:27) the wisdom of the elderly you know I don't think we get that far I'll grant that so society can't thrive

(3:06:32) without the elderly being there to guide the young right and to take care of uh you know the the

(3:06:38) but if there's certain traits that we were able to identify uh like that made a person more prone to

(3:06:46) homicide or alcoholism and things like this and we were able to detect those things before they were ever even born

(3:06:54) and you could just go ahead and abort that child because they were undesirable and now would not have those traits.

(3:07:00) Why would that be a problem? Well, I also think that that would be dangerous because we do not know when a

(3:07:08) trait is going to be advantageous. I think you never have to deal with it. You never have to deal with it.

(3:07:14) I think wait why is playing God? But why is playing God problematic? If the idea is through a form of cooperation in our

(3:07:20) trade, right? We cooperate together and we're cooperating together to get rid of all

(3:07:27) forms of humanity which cause us to not thrive. alcoholics. That's a thing of the past.

(3:07:34) It's gone. It's a genetic thing that we got rid of. Huntington's disease gone. We got rid of it. All of these kind of

(3:07:41) like core things we don't like, we got rid of them. And now we just never have to deal with

(3:07:46) them again. Why would that be bad? I mean I it's my understanding now I'm not a geneticist but it is my understanding

(3:07:53) that uh for instance like many East Asian people have a gene that makes

(3:07:58) their sweat essentially not smell uh as bad as ours uh which also

(3:08:04) correlates with um you know dry ear wax having dry ear wax. Okay. Now, I think that it would be

(3:08:12) incredibly tricky um to if we could effectively truly

(3:08:19) not essentially [ __ ] ourselves genetically and evolutionarily. Yeah. Let's just say that we had the

(3:08:25) ability through technology to see traits that we considered less than desirable

(3:08:30) in humanity and could select out for those through abortion in the day one and you could just go ahead and get

(3:08:36) pregnant again the next day. In fact, right? But we could just edit those traits out, right, by aborting those

(3:08:42) children and have kind of like a super race of genetically enhanced people who

(3:08:48) basically like we don't why do we why why is that bad? How would that how would that affect society? we can I

(3:08:54) don't think that we can anticipate when uh a specific gene or trait is going to be useful or use

(3:09:01) actually responding I'm sorry I'm sorry I have to cut in but responding to that would be bad that would be bad because

(3:09:07) again I do not think that you could determine when those traits may or may not be you never have to deal with those traits

(3:09:14) because they're gone but there could come a point in time in which those traits are desirable

(3:09:21) that alcoholism is desirable I mean, [ __ ] I don't know.

(3:09:27) You don't know if you wait. So, to get this right. Mhm. In the spirit of cooperation, if we were

(3:09:34) to genetically go through and callull out all undesirable traits in humanity

(3:09:40) like alcoholism that people have a genetic predisposition towards and many, many, many other things. Like let's say

(3:09:46) for instance that we as a society uh determined that through cooperation that

(3:09:52) alcoholism was a big problem and we could just edit that out by simply aborting everybody had that gene till

(3:09:58) that gene no longer existed day one where you don't even consider it to be murder. Why would that be bad?

(3:10:05) Again, I don't think that you could meaningfully and seriously determine

(3:10:11) that that to benefit society. Well, you couldn't. Okay, wait a second. Wait a second. I'm sorry. So then how do

(3:10:18) we make a determination about what benefits society? How do we determine that?

(3:10:25) How do we determine what benefits society? Oh, it would depend from society to society, but again, if we're talking

(3:10:30) about calling genes, I do think that there are traits that are in some scenarios desirable while in others

(3:10:37) undesirable. So then if you socially determine that this trait is undesirable for your society, how in the world could

(3:10:43) you conrue that as being bad? Well, I wouldn't want to get rid of someone just because I I think that they

(3:10:49) have a trait. You're not getting rid of someone. You don't consider abortion murder, right?

(3:10:55) Uh I do think that selectively aborting children on their also genes are not

(3:11:00) always expressed. So alcoholism runs in my family. that my family would have to

(3:11:06) stop like uh you know no you if you were able to identify the

(3:11:11) gene no they wouldn't have to stop reproducing if you could identify the gene right

(3:11:17) then you could simply abort that baby until you got to a baby that did not have that gene

(3:11:22) um well it's also I mean like the way that our genes are expressed too is also environmentally determined in the sense

(3:11:29) that like some genes can be like uh again based on your environment can

(3:11:34) activate or not activate. So it's this is they can't activate if they're not there.

(3:11:42) I mean like again you would have to get rid of like like entire families and family lines.

(3:11:47) You wouldn't have to get rid of anybody. You would simply abort children day one that had X gene in them and then you

(3:11:54) never have to deal with the trait again. Well, you would have to get rid of a whole lot of people if you wanted to get

(3:12:00) rid of them. They're not people. What do you mean? They're just they're just a fetus.

(3:12:05) They're like tissue or whatever, right? Uh I think that that would be eugenics.

(3:12:10) Um and what's wrong with it? But what would be you haven't actually told me how it

(3:12:15) would be that if I could identify the gene for alcoholism and we as a society determine to abort

(3:12:22) all children who have the gene for alcoholism, how that would make for a worse society. You say, "Well, genes can

(3:12:29) manifest themselves based on environment." I agree. Unless we get rid of that gene, then it can't ever

(3:12:35) manifest itself based on the environment. Right? So, I don't understand how society worse. If we

(3:12:42) selectively edited out the gene for alcoholism through abortion, how would that make society worse?

(3:12:51) Because again I think that uh that is a specifically

(3:12:57) alcoholism. [Music] Again I would say I would say that again

(3:13:05) we cannot determine what genes or genetic expressions will be advantageous depending I don't think we can know the

(3:13:11) future. I don't think okay you're right. You're right. You're right. I'm sorry. I thought you were saying something else. You're right. I

(3:13:17) shouldn't have cut in so I'll just ask this instead. Okay. Okay. You're right. We can't determine the future. Tell me how society becomes

(3:13:23) advantageous any at any point ever by it having an alcoholic gene.

(3:13:29) Um I mean I think that addictive personalities can do fairly well in specific fields like you brought up you

(3:13:36) know people with more homicidal tendencies. I think that there are job fields that are uh you know a bit more

(3:13:44) open to people with those sorts of proclivities. for instance like like sociopathy like I think that I don't

(3:13:51) know uh high earning CEOs do do better with uh some sociopathic traits um also

(3:13:58) so I have attention deficit hyperactive disorder and our our kind tends to uh

(3:14:04) trend towards addiction um adrenaline seeking sensation seeking

(3:14:10) however people with these same tendencies tend to do well in high stress scenarios and situations such is

(3:14:16) in medicine or in fieldwork of some kind. So again, I think that if you try to prune a population for undesirable

(3:14:25) genes, I think that you are going to um uh in the long run uh buck your,

(3:14:34) you know, ability to to grow together or advance in any meaningful way.

(3:14:40) I totally understand. I just got to ask you this. Huntington's disease is an inherited progressive brain disorder

(3:14:46) caused by a faulty gene. It's not contagious, but if one parent carries the faulty gene, each child has

(3:14:53) a 50% chance of inheriting it. Now, you see, the way that the medical

(3:14:59) establishment has combed Huntington's disease is by telling women who are

(3:15:05) going to who have that gene to not have children and if they do to abort it. Are they wrong?

(3:15:13) I think that uh forcing someone to have an abortion, not forcing them

(3:15:19) forcing, but they're not forcing them. Yeah. Advising. Uhhuh. Um I mean, I think it is

(3:15:25) better to uh Would you advise them to have an abortion if there's a 50% chance their

(3:15:31) kid would have this horrible neurological disease that [ __ ] killed them? I mean, [ __ ] Uh yeah, I would because I

(3:15:38) would not want them to feel the horrific pain of,

(3:15:43) you know, losing a But not alcoholism, though. If you could compensate for alcoholism, you wouldn't

(3:15:49) do that, though? No, because again, I think that alcoholism is a bit more complex.

(3:15:54) Okay. So, what about TW? If it was 20% that you would be an alcoholic, would you go ahead and just, you know, tell

(3:16:01) them 50%. So a degenerative brain disease is going to kill you. Um

(3:16:06) alcoholism is not always going to kill you. There are in fact many recovered alcoholics.

(3:16:13) Okay. So to to get this right, you do believe in eugenics. You just only believe in eugenics when it comes to

(3:16:20) like contagious or non-contagious diseases that you could only potentially inherit.

(3:16:26) I think that it is humane to inform someone uh if they are pregnant that

(3:16:32) they could experience a devastating loss in the future. That's not what you said. You said you

(3:16:37) would advise them to have an abortion. Um

(3:16:43) I mean you can advise them but you can't force them to. Yeah. You're not forcing them but why are you advising them to? Because

(3:16:49) there's a dehabilitating thing that you don't want that child to live with. And you don't chance. Yeah, there's

(3:16:55) 50/50 chance. That's right. Which is which is pretty brutal. 50-50 chance that a child survives or dies

(3:17:01) horribly and you are left traumatized and scarred. Now, I would say that that is humane. I don't think

(3:17:08) is that eugenics. Is that eugenics? Uh, no. Because the degenerative brain

(3:17:15) disease is going to kill you fairly immediately. Yeah, I know. So, you're you're taking out the child before that happens.

(3:17:21) You're taking out the undesirable things that you don't like. Is that eugenics?

(3:17:27) I mean, how quickly does Huntington's disease kill you? Because I do think there's a difference. Fairly quickly.

(3:17:33) Okay. So, uh, again, I I think that if you are going

(3:17:40) to have a child that immediately dies, yes, I think that I would

(3:17:46) not immediately. They don't immediately die, but they they you know, they might die in their 20s.

(3:17:52) Oh, well that's I thought you meant like uh but they could die they could die way

(3:17:57) earlier than that too. It manifests very quickly. Okay. Um well that would be different then because I I would think that you

(3:18:04) know so you wouldn't advise them to have an abortion if they had a 50% chance of getting this dehabilitating neurological

(3:18:09) disease that would kill them. I would warn them that there's a 50% chance that this could happen

(3:18:15) that they could make no I would trust that they could make their own decisions and choose what they want to do.

(3:18:21) So to get this right, if there is a society somewhere which implements a law which says that

(3:18:29) you if you hold this gene for Huntington's disease and it's rare

(3:18:35) and by you not reproducing we will eliminate this disease from planet Earth for all time. You would advise them not

(3:18:42) to do that? I don't think that you can successfully eliminate a a gene from society for for

(3:18:48) all time. Why not? I think that that would be What are you talking about that genes are eliminated from society all the time

(3:18:55) for all time? What do you mean intent to intentionally wipe it out? Yeah. Have you I'm sorry. Have you ever

(3:19:02) seen dog breeders Dog breeders breed out bad genes all the time? Right. And that's how you end up

(3:19:08) with different dog breeds. That's the whole point of it, right? The whole point is to edit out all the

(3:19:13) the [ __ ] you don't want to keep in the [ __ ] you do want. Do you think that humans are different that you could not

(3:19:19) selectively edit until you got to a breed that you wanted? Um, I think that we are more intelligent

(3:19:26) and complex than dogs. Uh, I also do think that so we should select for intelligence.

(3:19:31) Also, I would also like to say I would also like to say that I am against selective dog breeding. I don't think

(3:19:37) it's You're against sele Why would you So like no service dogs anymore. No, that's fine. Uh

(3:19:44) that's selective dog breeding, lady. No, service dogs can be a variety of breeds. However,

(3:19:49) No, they really can't be a variety of breeds. You have to have specific breeds to be service dogs. I've seen plenty of service dogs of

(3:19:55) No, you haven't seen Okay. What? What? They've like opened up the door for like therapeutic service.

(3:20:01) Yeah. Yeah. That's not a service dog. Okay. If you you want blind people to have a dog, it's got to be a certain breed.

(3:20:07) Right. Right. I I had a friend who had like uh severe like muscle tissue issues

(3:20:13) who had one service dog that was a um German Shepherd, another one that was like this. I don't know what kind of dog breed he

(3:20:20) was, but his name was Peanut and he was very small. Could you have a service dog that was highly

(3:20:25) did their job just fine? Got it. Could Could you have a service dog which was highly aggressive?

(3:20:31) Uh, I don't think that that would be good, but again, I think that aggression is bad.

(3:20:36) So, so wait, I'm that's I'm super confused. So, you think that we should allow people to have service dogs, which

(3:20:42) are highly aggressive or do you think we should breed aggression out of service dogs so that

(3:20:48) they're no longer highly aggressive? I don't think that we breed specifically for service dogs specifically for

(3:20:54) service dogs. Yes. But there's so many breeds that can be service dogs. That's true. But there's not so many

(3:21:00) breeds that can be for every ailment, right? You're going to have to have a dog, for instance, if it's leading blind people, who's highly intelligent, has

(3:21:07) intuition, is not very aggressive, you're going to have to have all sorts of traits which are built into that dog,

(3:21:13) right, through selective breeding. Um, let me look this up because it

(3:21:18) actually does seem like there's a wide variety of uh like

(3:21:24) dogs. So, um, actually, German Shepherds are pretty commonly service dogs, but

(3:21:30) they're also very commonly police dogs. That's true. So, here's what's interesting. Do trained for aggression. Correct.

(3:21:36) Ah, here's what's so interesting. You can take a German Shepherd and have specific breeds which are non-aggressive

(3:21:42) and breed only non-aggressive service dogs, and you can have German Shepherds, which have high aggression, and only

(3:21:49) breed aggressive police dogs. Mhm. Um, so what I'm seeing right now is that

(3:21:56) uh like MUTs are actually like fairly reliable um service dogs and it's based

(3:22:04) more on for blind people for the blind. Uh-huh.

(3:22:10) You're just going to go get a random mud at the pound? I mean, no, you do have to, you know,

(3:22:16) ensure that the individual dog is like has the temperament. What's the best way to do that? Dogs of

(3:22:22) the same breed can be okay. My mom had two poodles.

(3:22:27) Mhm. Same parents. Yep. Uh Rubio, rest in peace, he just passed away. Um was the the most calm dog in

(3:22:36) the entire world. All right. He was also very small, but he was a protector. Okay. One time we

(3:22:43) got charged by a black lab and Rubio, all like [ __ ] 15 pounds of him. Um,

(3:22:49) squared up and heard his little legs growling at him because he was an elderly little dog. Uh, but he was again just a very calm

(3:22:56) little guy. Never barked. Just so chill. His sister Maisie, uh, she's the most

(3:23:04) nervous creature in the entire world. I've never met a yappier dog. She she's [ __ ] obnoxious. Love her to death,

(3:23:10) but holy mother of God. So what a dog breeder would do, he's also terrified of of other dogs.

(3:23:16) But so what a dog breeder would do who was selecting for the traits for the blind person is they would take like the timid

(3:23:21) dog and they would drown it and then they would take the traits from the dog who isn't drowned. And I'm not

(3:23:27) kidding. They just take buckets and they drown the puppies in the buckets. And then they would take the non-aggressive one and they would rebreed that one. And

(3:23:33) then if there was any of the one that the puppies that had any of those traits, they would drown those. And then

(3:23:38) they would I mean everything right down to eye color they select for because it can have vision impairment issues.

(3:23:45) So the thing is is like so by your metric though we wouldn't even have service dogs because you don't believe

(3:23:51) in selective breeding. But you would need to use selective breeding to have animals that were

(3:23:56) competent. Like how could you not believe in selective breeding unless you're a vegan? Like we selectively breed for cows. We selectively breed for

(3:24:03) the dumbest chickens. We selectively breed for the most docil animals to feed the planet.

(3:24:08) Well, we were talking specifically about dogs, and I'm not going to lie. Well, you said animals. My mind my mind went

(3:24:14) primarily to like the existence of like pugs and other animals that are kind of uh

(3:24:20) that's all eugenics. Yeah. Which is which Well, they're they're they're kind of miserable, aren't they?

(3:24:25) Pugs. They don't seem very miserable. They seem pretty happy to me. But even if it was the case that I granted that they

(3:24:31) were pretty miserable, they don't live very long. There's tons of health issues. Yeah. But there's tons of peerbred dog

(3:24:36) breeds that do live a long time and are very well adjusted and very happy who are made that way through eugenic programming. Right.

(3:24:42) So the thing is I will grant you that maybe sometimes we can selectively breed animals that we

(3:24:48) but we can't do but okay. So what would be the argument then? So I don't believe in eugenics. I'm not a eugenicist. But I

(3:24:55) have a universal ethical system which would pertain to why it should not be for you. You just say based on this

(3:25:02) Harvard paper, they're pointing out a selective trait of cooperation in human beings and why it's so necessary that

(3:25:07) they have it. What I don't understand is how you get from that to you could cooperate as human beings to select out

(3:25:14) things which are not good for humanity, but you wouldn't do it. That's a contradiction to me.

(3:25:20) Why I wouldn't practice eugenics. Yeah. Why it would be if you as a

(3:25:26) society cooperated and eliminated various traits from humanity which were

(3:25:32) dire to human existence. Why you wouldn't do that?

(3:25:39) Well, I mean, I suppose a society could do that. Yeah, exactly. But I think that generally that society

(3:25:44) would struggle to um make friends. I think that they would struggle to cooperate with other people. But I also

(3:25:51) feel like it would be incredible. Why would they struggle to cooperate with other people? because again I think

(3:25:57) that uh they would struggle to find people that share the same moral values such as you know some people are bad

(3:26:03) let's get rid of let's get rid of certain people with certain traits. So like so let's say you have a society

(3:26:11) of millions of people who don't want to cooperate with other people. So what

(3:26:16) you couldn't say that you have like this universal you know ethical framework to call back upon because again it is like

(3:26:22) one that is uh you know constantly up for debate is it

(3:26:28) not? It's not you just said it's like one that that people have to determine. Uh

(3:26:34) so do you think people argue if you think again it's also based upon your interpretation of the text

(3:26:40) if you use so what you're talking about is you're you're talking about interpretive logic so you're saying

(3:26:46) you're are are you claiming I can't make a universal claim and justify it

(3:26:52) I think that um you cannot claim that my uh moral framework is uh inherently

(3:27:00) inferior to yours or in some capacity doesn't Oh, no. Just No, no, it's the opposite.

(3:27:06) Yours is it's the total opposite. I think you're misconstring it. The fact of the matter is is that the

(3:27:12) secular framework I love. I think it's great. I wish more of you would adopt only the type of framework

(3:27:18) you have because if when men like me get into positions of power and authority and we want to be oppressive, you don't

(3:27:26) have a single claim that you can make except that you just don't like it very much. And so ultimately

(3:27:32) um like I think I think I think it's fine. I've always thought that this was a massive weakness of secularists that

(3:27:39) the only claims that they make about morality is that it's just subjective and relative. Because if that's the case

(3:27:45) then any dictator who rises up and takes over your society and they just convince

(3:27:51) x amount of your society they're good, you really don't have a leg to stand on to say they're not. You can only say based on my own preferences, I just

(3:27:59) don't like this. And if that's the case, what the [ __ ] do I care? Okay. Well, according to my preferences, I do. So,

(3:28:06) it's just like if that's the case, if that's how you want to run societ that that we do have like sort of an inborn

(3:28:13) morality. Yeah. But you can't get and we exhibit we exhibit we exhibit these these these

(3:28:20) traits of wanting to cooperate and work with each other. Well, let me explain why. Not necessarily to our benefit. Let me

(3:28:26) explain why that doesn't matter. I'll just explain why that doesn't matter. Why doesn't that matter? Because because if it was the case that

(3:28:32) there was a counter society, right, who who came up right along with

(3:28:38) us, right along with us at the same time, they evolved to exactly they were indistinguishable from us except they

(3:28:44) didn't have that trait and they did have an inborn trait to rape. Is that an immoral society?

(3:28:51) But they have an inborn trait to rape. Mhm. Uh I don't think that um

(3:28:58) if they had it, if there was a rape trait. Yeah. This society evolved the same time

(3:29:05) as us. They're they're homo sapiens instead of sapiens. And or I'm sorry,

(3:29:11) they're sapiens. They're homo sapiens. And the homo sapiens evolved at exactly

(3:29:17) the same time as homo sapiens. Exactly the same time. They're like a counter. They look exactly like us, talk exactly

(3:29:23) like us. They're exactly like us in every way except the Scrapians, they have to rape. They like that's inbuilt

(3:29:30) in them. They have to do it. Are they doing anything wrong?

(3:29:36) Uh yeah, obviously. What are they doing wrong except being born with a trait you don't like?

(3:29:42) Exhibiting antisocial behaviors. Yeah, but why is that wrong except it's a trait you don't like?

(3:29:48) because it is not conducive to a creating a but that's a trait you said that's a

(3:29:54) trait you have that's inborn in you that's an immutable characteristic also making up the rape trait

(3:30:00) yes I know to test your logic so if the scrapens have this trait the rape trait

(3:30:05) yes I know I'm making it up yes I agree I'm making up the rape trait so the the scrapens they have an inborn trait and

(3:30:13) that trait is to rape and you have a trait that's inborn in you genetically

(3:30:19) to not do that. Why are the Srapapens evil and you're not evil?

(3:30:25) Um because I have human I have empathy. They have empathy, too.

(3:30:30) They don't. Yeah, they do. But they selectively apply it. Yeah, but but why does that make them

(3:30:36) bad? If they have that as a trait, that's an inborn trait they can't help.

(3:30:41) Why are they evil and you're good? What what's the paradigm here that makes the Srapapens evil? But you good. If you're

(3:30:49) both born with this trait, except they don't they're not born with that trait. They're born with the R trait and you're

(3:30:55) born with the intuitive cooperation trait. What is the thing that makes the Srapapians evil?

(3:31:04) Uh probably the rape trait, which does not exist. Um but if it did exist, there

(3:31:09) is no group of human beings that exist. Yeah, I know. They're not human beings. They're not homo sapiens. They're

(3:31:15) scraps. What makes the straps evil? I just feel like this is like a

(3:31:21) completely Can you just answer the question? What makes therap evil? Yeah.

(3:31:27) Goodness gracious. Um I think because again

(3:31:32) the the profound lack of empathy in the violation of uh other human beings other

(3:31:38) homo sapien whatever same genus the the violation of their

(3:31:44) right to exist without harm. Now I what so the thing that makes you good is that

(3:31:50) you're born that way. I think the thing that makes me want to

(3:31:56) be good and behave in a way is that you're born that way. So, so basically, so what you're saying, so what you're

(3:32:02) saying is what makes humanity good, what makes us good, man, is that we're humans. And if we're not humans, then

(3:32:09) we're not good. That's it. That's all. Listen, this is the reduction of your

(3:32:14) entire argument is because I'm a human being, I'm good. And if I'm you're not a

(3:32:19) human being, you're not [ __ ] good because you lack that trait. If I have the if I have the the capacity

(3:32:27) to have empathy and I have critical thinking skills, they have the capacity for critical thinking and empathy.

(3:32:34) And they still commit rapes. Yes. Uh I think that that would be um

(3:32:42) that's not a contradiction. You can have empathy and be a rapist, right? Yeah. I mean, yes, you can. I mean the

(3:32:48) Nazis loved animals. Yeah. Okay. So they hated Jewish people. So what is the thing that makes these

(3:32:53) people evil? They were born this way. What makes them evil? What makes the Sapians who have the same

(3:32:59) exact genetic makeup as you except this one trait, this evolutionary trait? What makes the Srapapians evil and you good?

(3:33:06) Evil is not a genetic trait. Yeah. I'm asking if they had this

(3:33:12) genetic trait, what would make them bad? What makes the Srapapians bad? Dude, I

(3:33:17) don't because of the rape. But again, dude, even if we turn this around on

(3:33:22) you, if I turn this around on you, turn it around on me. If I turn it around on you, like, why would it be bad? Because you think God

(3:33:30) is telling you that it's bad. Let's just assume that I'm going to just I'll just take your worldview on this.

(3:33:35) In fact, no, no, no, no. I want you to speak from your worldview. Yeah. So, I would appeal to uh the

(3:33:41) Christian God and the universal ethics that come down through Christian ethics. I'd give you the demonstration through

(3:33:47) suppositional logic as to why you would need to appeal to a god to even make knowledge claims to begin with. And then

(3:33:52) we would go down the pathway of uh the the path of um uh I guess the best way

(3:34:01) to do it is uh if if we were to take multiple

(3:34:07) worldviews and we're able to show that all of them were not true except this worldview. This is how I'm trying to

(3:34:12) explain the impossibility of the contrary to you. Right? This would be the pathway for me to

(3:34:17) logically get to Christianity. Now, uh I'm happy to answer your questions on that if you want. But the

(3:34:24) thing that's so interesting about this conversation is like why does it even matter? Let's say I was born with the

(3:34:31) trait to be a Christian. There would be no reason for you to deny me my Christianity nor any of the ethical

(3:34:37) frameworks or purviews in which I appeal to. And I can point to the fact that there is scientific literature that

(3:34:43) shows that we have genetic predispositions towards religion. So if it was just the case that I was genetically predisposed to be a

(3:34:50) Christian, you would have no leg to stand on to even try to falsify it. If it is the case that all you can say is

(3:34:57) that the Sapians would need to be destroyed because they're not humans,

(3:35:02) that's that's what your worldview reduces to. Do you understand? Like do you understand why I see this as being

(3:35:08) so absurd? Because if you say humans are born with a trait of cooperation, therefore we should cooperate. Okay,

(3:35:15) that makes sense. Scrapians are born with the trait to to to rape. Therefore,

(3:35:21) they should rape. And your answer is, well, no. Well, then your worldview here doesn't make any sense because on the

(3:35:27) one hand, you say if you're born to do this thing, you should. But if these people over here were born to do this thing, they should not. And so, you're

(3:35:33) making a universal claim about what is ethical. You're making a universal claim that human beings are more ethical than

(3:35:40) a counterhuman, like a counterhuman species. You would be still more ethical. You're making what right now a

(3:35:46) universal claim. That's what I'm trying to show you. Uh well, it's only a universal claim in

(3:35:51) your fantasy world in which there is an intelligent race that is genetically predisposed genetically predisposed to

(3:36:00) commit rapes which is and in that world with a universal I listen

(3:36:06) um we are not these we are humans though like the thing that that we are different from other animals

(3:36:12) because we have such a significant capacity for critical thinking Our cognitive

(3:36:18) abilities are incredible. There are in fact animals that do seem to chimpanzees versus bonobos are actually a great

(3:36:25) example of this. Uh chimpanzees are tend to be significantly more aggressive um

(3:36:32) than bonobos. They do in fact bonobos are closest. No, chimpanzees are aren't aren't

(3:36:39) chimpanzees actually the closest ancestor, but bonobos they have some type of like matriarchal society. So

(3:36:44) liberals always appeal to them. I don't remember. They're both actually extremely close to us. Um, it might be Bonabos. I don't remember.

(3:36:51) But how about anyway? Yeah. So what? So, so bonobos, if bonobos um, if they have a scrape

(3:36:58) culture, can we take them all out? No. But the difference between us and

(3:37:03) bonobos and chimpanzees, our closest relatives are that they lack the capacity to they

(3:37:09) they lack the predisposition to cooperate the way that that we do. They lack the intelligence. They don't have

(3:37:15) it. We have it. We have thought. We have the ability to exercise our critical

(3:37:21) thinking skills. I agree. We both have the the inborn. I agree. You and I, we have the ability

(3:37:27) to exercise our critical thinking skills. So, why aren't you driving a car right now?

(3:37:34) Oh, I'm sitting in my house. Right. Okay. What you just engaged in was a hypothetical. What I did was I

(3:37:40) took something which does not exist and then I put it in front of you to get some type of inductive reasoning so that

(3:37:47) you could respond to the claim you're making which is that you're not driving.

(3:37:52) So I know that what you can do if I give you a hypothetical is respond based on things that aren't factual and do not

(3:37:58) exist. In the case of the Srapapians, they do not exist. They're not factual. But it

(3:38:04) is not an argument for you to say because these things don't exist, I don't need to respond to my own logic of

(3:38:09) if they did. They do inside of the fantasy hypothetical I made up. There's

(3:38:14) an in there's a group who have a trait which is internal that makes them

(3:38:20) scrape. That's what they do. They're called the scrapens and and other than

(3:38:26) that trait, they're completely identical to human beings and they're born this way.

(3:38:32) Are they evil? Hang on. Hang on. Are they evil or not? Okay. Why aren't you in a spaceship,

(3:38:38) right? Why aren't you on Mars right now? Uh, I wouldn't qualify to go to Mars.

(3:38:43) Frankly, I don't have the skills. So, you're So, you know, so wait a second. So, I just gave you a I just g I

(3:38:49) just asked you a question. You had to come up in your head with a fantasy which envisioned you on Mars and you

(3:38:56) know you're not there and it doesn't exist. Just answer the question. Good. Then just answer the question. I could

(3:39:01) also come up with random ass hypothetical. Then give me those. Give me those. You have no Listen, I don't like to make

(3:39:07) that. I'm not I'm agnostic, but I don't like to get really aggressive with religious people because I'm respected.

(3:39:12) I respect their beliefs. But you don't have any proof that your God exists. And

(3:39:18) you don't have any proof that your universal Christian ethics are in fact

(3:39:25) the uh the the best the best way to be. You have individually made that

(3:39:31) decision. You have made the decision to adhere to them yourself. You have selected that religion. You have seen

(3:39:37) I'm willing to engage with both of those questions. Okay. Okay. As soon as you answer mine, the Srapians

(3:39:43) exist. There's an in there inside of them. I I know you're trying to evade this desperately, but please just answer

(3:39:50) because this is the spirit of real good faith. I'm trying to test your logic so that you can really understand how distorted

(3:39:56) this is. The sapiens exist counter to human beings. They evolved at exactly

(3:40:02) the same time. They have this imbued trait that you do not have and you have an imbued trait that they do not have.

(3:40:08) What is the thing that makes them bad? Um I would say that if they have an

(3:40:15) inborn predisposition to do harm to others and in fact to do harm to me and

(3:40:20) my own, I would say that they don't have any they're not they don't ever scrape you and yours. They never scrape outside of their own scrap.

(3:40:27) I think that having a I think that being an intelligent species, now mind you, there are animals that are instinctually

(3:40:34) do do harm. Like I think that pit bulls are a good example of that. They are, you know, raised to be aggressive. Um,

(3:40:41) however, their nurture can overcome their nature for sure, right? What's the thing that makes them evil?

(3:40:47) What's the thing that makes them bad? That's all I'm asking. What What thing makes them bad? They're born this way. They scrape each other. Okay, that's

(3:40:54) what they need. It would be their their capacity for critical thought and empathy

(3:41:00) uh that does not allow them to overcome their desire to to rape.

(3:41:07) Got it. I would say that that would be So, so then animals by this logic are evil.

(3:41:12) Uh animals aren't intelligent enough to comprehend the consequences of that. Wait, wait a second. Wait a second.

(3:41:17) Many of them are not. Wait, wait. I I'm I'm super confused here. You said it's lack of empathy and a lack

(3:41:26) of critical thinking. So if it's a lack of empathy and a lack of critical thinking, animals have both

(3:41:32) those components. Lack of empathy, lack of critical thinking. Therefore, they would be evil.

(3:41:38) No, no, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm saying that the the shrapens the shrapens have the capacity for

(3:41:44) critical thought. Correct. They are as intelligent as we are. Yes. But they have a trait where they want to

(3:41:50) rape. Yes. Rape. If you have the mental faculties to understand that you are doing harm to

(3:41:57) other individual, they don't think it's harmful because they don't have the same trait that you do. Their trait says that this is

(3:42:02) they're born to do this. That's what they do. Their rape trait, their traitual

(3:42:09) instinctual. Yes. So I think that that to them right this is as natural as

(3:42:15) breathing as as much as it is for you to naturally cooperate with other human beings.

(3:42:22) Okay. So um I would say that uh I grew

(3:42:28) up and had anger issues and often my instinct when mad would be to hit people

(3:42:33) but because I am a rational human being thinking human being I can go this is

(3:42:39) actually really antisocial and it would be bad. It would not be conducive to cooperating and living in a society with

(3:42:45) other people. So if the shrapens if the shrapens encounter us Mhm.

(3:42:50) and they they intelligently recognize that their way of life is abhorrent and evil to us and we have to live in

(3:42:57) but also I guess that the rape is a kind of difficult uh you know oh uh oh

(3:43:05) I think his sometimes his stuff goes out. It's okay. We'll just hang out until until he comes

(3:43:12) back. No worries. his I don't know if his webcam overheats or if his internet

(3:43:17) just sucks balls. Oh, gotcha. But either way, he'll be back. No worries. Okay. No,

(3:43:22) I might go I might go pee real quick. Why don't you go ahead and do that now while Okay. Yeah,

(3:43:28) because I have chugged two water bottles thus far. That's okay. No, go for it. Take your time.

(3:43:33) All right. I will be I will be right back. And hello to all of the maiders. You got

(3:43:40) a dono goal up. You need to get four more in to meet that timer. Uh you got 50 seconds to do it in. Don't

(3:43:46) disappoint. You guys have been doing great all night. And then now you're going to wait until the final

(3:43:51) uh well, not even the final. I don't even think we're halfway done, but you're going to wait till this dono to fail. 44 seconds. Unacceptable.

(3:43:59) Um while we're waiting for everyone, I know I know I said we would, you know,

(3:44:05) obviously open the panel, but I've been allowing room for them to have this conversation. And most of you have

(3:44:11) already pointed out, you haven't seen Andrew this calm, cool, and collected uh you know, in terms of especially talking

(3:44:18) with uh a progressive left-leaning feministic lady, right? So,

(3:44:25) um I find it to be a rarity to have this time or to have this moment or ability

(3:44:33) to do so. Uh so, since we're having this, we're going to let it roll. I'm

(3:44:39) going to let it roll 110%. Um, and I'm totally okay with it. Uh,

(3:44:46) you know, and if if it's already 1:00 a.m. for me, so you know, maybe when Andrew gets back, we will see what

(3:44:54) happens. Uh, and maybe we can move. Be interested in letting uh some other

(3:45:01) people join the conversation and add a couple things into it. but

(3:45:07) we might uh uh lose uh the good conversation that we're

(3:45:14) having. So, we will see. Uh I don't know what's going on with Andrew.

(3:45:21) Looks like he's still up on his end.

(3:45:27) [Music] Uh, is he um

(3:45:34) is he still like live? I don't know where he goes live.

(3:45:40) Oh, he's he's back. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I have no idea what just happened.

(3:45:45) Uh, stream crashed out for no reason at all. Yeah, your thing started spiraling. So,

(3:45:50) it's it's okay. It's no big deal. But anyway, yeah. So, so just real quick to to briefly wrap this up because we're

(3:45:57) just going in circles and I I get it. I'm just going to say this like Mhm. the the the reason that this makes no

(3:46:04) sense is because anything that you're appealing to for why the Scrapians are

(3:46:09) bad, right, is the same thing that you would be appealing to for why it is that you're good. But it just begs the

(3:46:15) question of what makes that good. And you say, well, what makes it good is that it's an internal trait that I have.

(3:46:21) That's what makes it good. this rapian also. Yeah, but yeah, but what makes

(3:46:26) that good is because you're that thing. You see what I mean? Does that make sense? But also the the idea of an inborn trait

(3:46:33) to rape, but you say the Sapians don't have an issue with it. Rape is it's that is that is uh very very explicitly a

(3:46:41) violation of consent. Oh, no. The women the female sapiens definitely have a problem with it.

(3:46:46) Okay. So, the female sorapians definitely have a problem with it. Yeah. Unless they're doing it, then they don't have a problem with it.

(3:46:51) Aren't they? Okay, I see. So, okay.

(3:46:56) Um, but the thing is is like when we're talking about do you understand when you say

(3:47:02) Mhm. I am the reason that I can make these moral claims is because I have an

(3:47:08) ingrown trait that that is just moral because it exists. They say the same

(3:47:14) thing. They'll make the counter claim to you. I also am moral because I have an ingrain trait and it just exists. What

(3:47:20) is the thing that you would actually be appealing to that they're not appealing to? It's just your own trait again. You

(3:47:26) see what I mean? Yes. But they have a profoundly antisocial trait.

(3:47:31) Yeah. But the but but that's the problem. You like you say, "I have this trait and the thing that makes the trait

(3:47:38) good is that it's the trait." And they say, "Yeah, I have a trait, too." And the thing that makes it goodal

(3:47:45) our species. Yeah. But it's not though. It's not integral to the survival of their species. They still cooperate.

(3:47:51) They just also have this other trait where they where they where Yeah. where they scrape. Yes.

(3:47:58) Yes. That's right. Um and so you don't have the trait, but you appeal to this other trait and say the

(3:48:03) thing that makes this trait good is that it's good because it's good, man. Because I have it. That's what makes it good. They appeal to the same thing. Do

(3:48:10) you see? Do you see why that doesn't make sense? think that they are evil and bad because they understand the harm that they are doing and they don't care.

(3:48:18) Yeah. But that would be appealing to a trait. Again, the thing that you makes

(3:48:23) you think that that's harmful and bad is that cooperation trait that you have their trait.

(3:48:29) You're using you're using the word rape and the female strains do not like it. They are and the male ones don't like it

(3:48:36) when they do it to them. Yeah. Okay. So they understand that they're doing evil and cruel things to each

(3:48:41) other. They don't consider it evil. They consider it part of their nature. It's just part of their nature that they may not like or sometimes don't like

(3:48:51) even though they're still they still do it by instinct. Yeah. They do it by instinct, right? And

(3:48:56) they kill each other. And do we not do everything in our power typically is that is

(3:49:01) to circumvent uh murder. I mean, we could argue that my point exactly my

(3:49:07) point is that if it were the case that you had a trait inside of you that made you murderer and you just appealed to

(3:49:13) the trait and said it must be good because I was born with it. It's exactly what you're doing. You're saying the

(3:49:18) only thing that makes you good is that you have a trait inside of you that you think is good. Anybody can make the same

(3:49:24) claim with any trait. That's the whole point. A murderer that has been empirically observed. There's empirical evidence for this.

(3:49:30) Sure. If it was empirically observed that they had a trait that made them stra, what would make that less moral

(3:49:36) than your than the thing you're appealing to? That you're both appealing to the same thing. You're literally both

(3:49:42) appealing to the same exact concept. Than the fantasy rape species. Yes. That's right. The fantasy evil

(3:49:48) fantasy rape species. That's right. Yes. Uh makes them shitty is that they know that

(3:49:55) they're doing that they're doing harm and they still continue to do it. Yeah,

(3:50:00) I know. But you have a trait inside you that makes you think that's bad, right?

(3:50:06) Yes. And you're appealing to that trait and saying it's based on that trait that I

(3:50:12) have that tells me this is bad. Right. They're appealing to the same thing. A

(3:50:17) trait where they say, "No, this is good." Right? You say, "No, it's bad." But you're both appealing to the same

(3:50:23) thing. You're both appealing to a trait that you have.

(3:50:28) Well, I suppose we'd have to do what we're doing right now, which is, you know, kind of try to uh figure out how

(3:50:35) to live with each other um with with a different more

(3:50:40) Why do you need to live together? I suppose you don't need to live together. I wouldn't want to live with each other.

(3:50:46) Exactly. Then it wouldn't be relevant. Then it wouldn't be relevant. No, it's still relevant. If I didn't have to live with the Sapians, if I

(3:50:52) didn't have to live with them, I'd be like, "Well, that's really gross and awful and evil and I think that they're bad, but I

(3:50:58) don't have to live with you." But the thing that makes them bad is that you have a trait inside you that

(3:51:04) you were just born with. And that trait is good because you say it's good.

(3:51:11) Do you see? It's good because it allows me to live in peace with my species. It has what?

(3:51:18) it has. So Stanford Stanford is the last name of the guy, not the not the institution that this academic journal

(3:51:24) belongs to, by the way, because you said it was Harvard earlier. Um, he argues that this actually never said it was Harvard, I'm sure.

(3:51:32) Okay. So pretty. Anyway, this this uh you know specific um

(3:51:40) like like our capacity to uh our our tendency

(3:51:46) to externalize our morality and determine who we wish to associate based on with based upon our externalized

(3:51:52) morality uh has probably you know significantly increased our like

(3:51:59) cognitive capacities and like abilities. Um, so this might be like a part of why

(3:52:05) we are such an intelligent species. Um, these are all descriptors though. All

(3:52:10) that they do is explain why we're this way, not why we should be this way. Why we should be this way.

(3:52:15) Yeah. Do you understand that? Like if it is the case that uh I have a a gene,

(3:52:21) right, that makes me more prone to alcohol, which I probably do because I'm Irish, right? And this is like a common

(3:52:27) stereotype. uh why shouldn't I be an alcoholic if I

(3:52:32) have this inborn trait? You would say, well, because, you know, I don't know, it can ruin your

(3:52:38) life or this or that. But if I want my life ruined and I just want to be an alcoholic. Mhm. Do you care?

(3:52:46) Do I care if you want to ruin your life? Yeah. Um,

(3:52:54) if I had to live with you in my community, you don't have to live with me in your community. I live on the other side of

(3:52:59) the world in Idoland and we all drink ourselves to death because we think it's fun. Uh, I mean, I would

(3:53:06) be like, whoa, that's weird and bad. That's not good. That's But what makes it bad, though?

(3:53:12) The antisocial properties. I mean, I suppose the one universal. But you see how you keep on I can I can grant you the one universal

(3:53:19) I can grant you is that I think as animals we do have some sort of drive to

(3:53:25) propagate our species. Would you agree or disagree? Um well no I would I would disagree. I

(3:53:32) think that we have the drive to have sexual intercourse not necessarily to propagate

(3:53:37) right which which we want to which leads typically to to

(3:53:44) reproduction. We have natural desires that that cause arousal.

(3:53:49) Yes, that is the case. So, it is a side effect of sexual that that we have children. But the

(3:53:55) desire to propagate itself uh I think that uh that would vary uh

(3:54:01) greatly, but the desire to have sexual intercourse doesn't vary so much. So, no, I'm not willing to kind of grant the

(3:54:07) idea that human beings have a massive drive necessarily for propagation, but I'd rather a massive drive for sex,

(3:54:13) which leads to propagation. I would say most mammal species operate in this fashion that rabbits that rabbits don't give a

(3:54:20) [ __ ] about having kids. They just want to fly. No, of course not. It's just it's what we do. Yeah. You know, it's what our it's what

(3:54:26) our bodies, what our biology. So, the thing is is when we're talking about when we're talking about versus ises, you're giving me a bunch of

(3:54:33) descriptors for how human beings operate. That's great, but not descriptors for why they ought.

(3:54:39) And then when I ask you why they ought to, you say because we do. We ought to operate this way because we

(3:54:44) do operate this way. That's why we should operate this way because we operate this way.

(3:54:49) That's not only circular, but it's actually [ __ ] because you could just make that qu that you can make that claim with anything. The Irish should

(3:54:56) drink themselves to death. Why? Because they do drink themselves to death. Why is that bad though? Because that's what

(3:55:01) we do. But I also feel that you are operating on the same circular logic in the sense

(3:55:06) that like if I ask you why something is moral or immoral, you will say because

(3:55:11) God says so. And I'll say, how do you know God says so? Well, I I just think he does. Like

(3:55:16) again, it's going to go there's no really like again like evidence that you could provide me to to have a sort of

(3:55:23) concrete. Why? But here's the thing that's funny is like uh what standard of evidence first of

(3:55:28) all two questions. One, what standard of evidence would you even accept as the most prominent atheist Richard Dawkins

(3:55:35) said if he looked at this guy and it said, "Richard, I'm God," he would reject it. Okay? And then second, uh

(3:55:42) even if that was the case, who cares? Like even if I'm totally wrong, who gives a [ __ ] Ultimately, you can never

(3:55:49) appeal to anything for why I'm wrong. Except you are, because you are, because I think you are, because you are,

(3:55:55) because the traits inside me say you are, and that's and the reason they're right is because they are. And so

(3:56:00) ultimately, you also can't prove why I'm wrong. Oh, no. It's only on the basis of your

(3:56:06) miss. I'm not trying to prove you wrong. I'm

(3:56:11) trying to make sure that you affirm the belief that all things which are moral

(3:56:16) are just completely subjectively relevant or relative to your preferences and feelings. I don't give a [ __ ] about

(3:56:24) you being wrong. I'm happy that you hold those preferences because that means that any condemnation that you ever give

(3:56:31) as a moral prescription towards another human being doesn't mean [ __ ] because it's just [ __ ] relative. It doesn't

(3:56:37) mean [ __ ] If a dictator goes in, that's fine. I'm looking for the position of power. I'm telling Christians they

(3:56:44) should be in a position of power and authority. And [ __ ] secularists can't make a single argument for why they

(3:56:49) shouldn't, except cuz it makes us feel bad. So you're banking on Christian morality. You're banking on our moral

(3:56:56) system to hold us back from literally ruling over all of you [ __ ] And that's what's so hilarious. I'm banking

(3:57:03) on Christian ethics led to the, you know, the greatest peace

(3:57:08) on our on our on our earth. What when when was this? I mean, secularism brought us like

(3:57:16) America. It brought us America, didn't it? Secularism didn't Okay. And was America founded on colonialism and genocide?

(3:57:23) The reason that you can be like, you know, orthodox is that you could you could be because

(3:57:30) of secularism. Wait a second. Secularism that allows you to exist as an orthodox now in America.

(3:57:37) Okay. Was America founded on colonialism and genocide? It sure was. That was brought to us by

(3:57:43) secularism. Okay, great. The good part of it are actively So secularists who are peaceful brought

(3:57:50) us colonialism and genocide. Brilliant argument. No, I mean the founding principles of

(3:57:55) America, how the country was settled is different. I get it. Hang on. The founders who were

(3:58:01) a bunch of genocidal maniacs who killed all the engines, right? killed all the natives, killed all the people, right?

(3:58:08) And committed colonialism and genocide. They were secularists. And secularist brought us the greatest amount of peace.

(3:58:14) Is that right? Uh well, no. Many of the settlers

(3:58:20) themselves were religious, but it, you know, like we were not killing

(3:58:26) Christians. We were not killing other Christians. Again, it was secularism that allows you to only Christian lives matter.

(3:58:32) So only Christian lives matter. No, that's not at all what I said. But I'm talking about you like again like it is

(3:58:38) it is it is secularism that allows you to be what you are. You are not like

(3:58:43) like forced to uh adhere to whatever government state religion we want. Like

(3:58:49) it is it is it is the secularists that allow you to have these beliefs. Oh, I didn't know that. So there's no

(3:58:54) state religions anywhere that allow people to have the free exercise of religion even while they have a state religion?

(3:59:00) Uh there are some, but they typically tend to again be pretty uh you know

(3:59:07) shitty towards people that do not adhere to the Oh, really? like the Norwegian nations like uh like I'm I'm sorry, not the

(3:59:13) Norwegian nations, the um the Nordic nations. The Nordic nations who have state religions, they tend to be really

(3:59:19) shitty towards people who aren't part of those religions, do they? Uh they have a No. So Norway is not a

(3:59:26) Christian state. I didn't say Norway. I said Nordic nations. Which Nordic nations are Christian state? Look up Nordic nation state religion.

(3:59:38) I believe it's um I'm trying to go off the top of my head here. I don't I

(3:59:43) usually have a reference in front of me. Uh so most Nordic countries uh have uh

(3:59:49) disestablished their state churches. That's nice. What about the ones who haven't though?

(3:59:55) So, um, it's just Denmark. Okay. So, Den Denmark has a state

(4:00:00) religion and they're really just not peaceful towards people who aren't part of that religion. Then,

(4:00:05) um, Denmark's fine, but it seems like they're most likely to disestablish the Church of Denmark as the state religion.

(4:00:12) I also think that there's probably too many prominent examples of, you know, nations that are

(4:00:19) religion such as when do they plan on getting rid of the state religion are very violent? When do they plan on it? I

(4:00:25) think that they most likely will if all the other Nordic countries are Oh, really? When?

(4:00:31) When? Yeah, it was 2017 when Norway did Norway did what?

(4:00:38) Uh disestablish the the like the the separated of church. Hold on.

(4:00:49) Is there a Church of England by chance? There is. Oh, and what is that? Anglican.

(4:00:55) Yeah, but there's a persecuted for being Anglican. You were at one point. Yes, you were at

(4:01:01) one point. Now, but now it is secular. So, no, it's not secular. They have they have a separation of

(4:01:07) church and state. They have a separation. Do you understand that you saying that a there's a separation of church and state

(4:01:13) doesn't mean that secularists brought us that? That Christians can have state churches and still value the free

(4:01:20) exercise of worship. Do you understand that? These are not claimed when you make these claims secularists are the

(4:01:25) reason that you can worship right now. Uh no in fact in fact that's not the case. The very first secularist nation

(4:01:31) that I'm aware of was the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union stop the very first the

(4:01:37) very first sisters had to flee. The very first Yeah. Okay. Great. They had to flee, man. Everyone had to flee

(4:01:43) at some point, man. But anyway, the very first secular state I can think of was the Soviet Union. And the Soviet Union

(4:01:49) did away with Christianity by killing them. That's what they did. Thesar of Russia, who they went in and killed, was

(4:01:56) an Orthodox Christian. They killed them all. That's what the Bolsheviks did. They killed them. Bolshevik atheists

(4:02:03) killed everybody. They were actually the first secular state was the United States of America.

(4:02:08) No, it wasn't a secular state. No, it was. No, it wasn't. That That is in our Constitution, isn't

(4:02:14) it? No, it's not in our Constitution. The first amendment says that the Congress cannot make an establishment of religion

(4:02:20) which favors one over the other. That is not a secular state at all. Yeah, that is a secular state.

(4:02:26) No, it's not a secular state. That is a separation of church and state. We have a separation of church and state.

(4:02:31) Our original all of our original states had state religions. All of them. Post

(4:02:37) the first amendment. Post the first amendment. The 10th amendment allowed for states to have their own state

(4:02:45) religion. You are told that's not our country. That's a different that is a not our nation. Our

(4:02:50) nation was a secular nation. How can it be a secular nation where where individual states can have their

(4:02:55) own state religion? How is that a secular nation? Uh well that is you know a difference

(4:03:00) between federal and state powers. That is a it's not a secular nation. That's just made up.

(4:03:06) We have a secular nation man official religion. And there's a separation of church.

(4:03:11) You don't need to have an official religion level for you to have it at the state level. State man, I don't

(4:03:18) should the constitution anywhere where it says there's a separation between church and state anywhere.

(4:03:23) Uh the first amendment prevents congress from creating or establishing a religion. So I'm sorry. Where does it say anything

(4:03:30) about separation of church and state? I don't it's dude it is literally like

(4:03:36) the first amendment. Like I don't even The First Amendment literally doesn't say that. It literally doesn't literally quite

(4:03:43) literally. It literally doesn't quite literally say that at all.

(4:03:48) I mean, I guess if you can't like read No, I can read. Can you read context

(4:03:55) clues? Can you read me the word church? Can you read me any of that? What? What context clues? Do you

(4:04:01) understand that if it is the case that all of our states could have state

(4:04:08) religions and the federal government couldn't interfere in the establishment with states making state religions? This

(4:04:16) wasn't a secular nation. Do you understand that?

(4:04:21) So what is saying is that Congress can't go to the states and tell the states which religion they have to follow.

(4:04:27) That's it. Yeah. That's all it's saying. Precisely. That's not a secular nation.

(4:04:32) Yes, it is. It is a secular We have a secular nation, man. Yeah. A secular nation would be saying that um

(4:04:40) I don't know the the the constitution prevents religion or religion can't have an establishment of authority or there

(4:04:47) can't be states. Someone brought up a uh a uh a quote here from President John Adams as the

(4:04:53) government United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion. Um, I want to Adams,

(4:05:02) government of the United States. You know, there was way more founders than John Adams, right?

(4:05:07) Of course. Yeah. But I mean, uh, Thomas Jefferson in the letter to the Danbury Baptist reiterates that religion is a

(4:05:13) matter which lies solely between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship. The

(4:05:19) legitimate powers of government reach actions only, not opinions. Um, I I

(4:05:24) contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that the legislature should not should make no law respecting

(4:05:30) the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. Um, and when was Thomas Jefferson president?

(4:05:38) He was the third. Okay. And what years were those?

(4:05:43) Um, let me do the math. I think George Washington had three terms. So that was

(4:05:50) and when did it well what was the year on the letter on the letter?

(4:05:55) Um Danbury Baptist. Yeah. What year?

(4:06:06) 1802. Oh 1802. So this was long after the constitution was established.

(4:06:15) Is that correct? But in our literally that's really Wait a second. As Americans, we are

(4:06:20) guaranteed separation of church and state. So Thomas Jefferson, who was going stateto state because he wanted a

(4:06:26) stronger federal body. So he was trying to get states to eliminate state religions, which they were allowed to

(4:06:32) have under the federal constitution. You're going to read his letter after the ratification of the constitution

(4:06:38) 1802 as though that's evidence of a secular nation. Brilliant argument.

(4:06:44) We we absolutely have this. It's in the uh let me see what is it saying? We absolutely don't have this. Read the

(4:06:50) 10th amendment. The uh the 10th amendment. Yeah, read the 10th amendment.

(4:07:00) Reinforce the principle of federalism by saying that any powers not delegated to the federal government nor are reserved to the states of those federal power

(4:07:07) only those explicitly on the constitution. So yeah, as a nation, yeah, sure, certainly states could have their own individual.

(4:07:13) So what the first saying no longer do is understand, but they could and can. But

(4:07:19) what the first amendment actually says then is that Congress is not able to establish a law because, right, they

(4:07:28) left it up to the individual states and not as a federal authority. But that

(4:07:33) doesn't make it a secular nation. They literally let each state determine whatever state religion they wanted to

(4:07:40) and inside of that state it was highly enforced. How can you say we have a secular nation where individual states

(4:07:47) can say Catholics can't come here? Can you explain that to me? Did we have states where Catholics

(4:07:53) weren't allowed to come there? Well, clearly we corrected. And also it wasn't our nation. It was individual

(4:07:58) states. Clearly we corrected. I'm sorry. uh first amendment and 10th amendment changed last time I looked because it

(4:08:04) didn't. The thing is is that no, it wasn't founded as a secular nation. No, there were states that had their own

(4:08:10) independent uh uh religions and yes, they could bar and make law based on those religions. How the [ __ ] could that

(4:08:17) be a secular amendment enforces equal protection onto the establishment clause of the first amendment? It is outlawed

(4:08:22) constitutionally. So read the 14th amendment and get to amendment. Yeah, read it.

(4:08:32) Um, our citizen tell due process

(4:08:39) which mean citizen close. Mhm. What year was the 14th amendment

(4:08:46) ratified? I don't [ __ ] remember. 1868. Yeah. But man, the thing is is that you

(4:08:52) are like you are arguing about all this stuff. thing is is that like I need you

(4:08:58) to understand. I need you to understand. It's my understanding that you're a recent convert. Um I don't know if you

(4:09:03) were atheist before or what. Were you atheist? Were you raised with a religion? Did you go to church?

(4:09:09) Yeah. Okay. But you're a recent convert to to Orthodox Christianity. Um Yeah. So what?

(4:09:14) Like No, there's nothing wrong with that. But the thing is that between different denominations, not that recent anymore, by the way.

(4:09:20) historically. Um it uh like well I mean you should know

(4:09:25) this. I mean your ancestors were most likely Catholics fleeing persecution from Protestants and that's why they

(4:09:31) came to the US. Be the other way around. It would be Protestants fleeing persecution from Anglicans.

(4:09:38) Okay. Um my bad. Most definitely not going to be Catholics uh

(4:09:43) fleeing Protestants. It would be Protestants fleeing from Anglican. But anyway, go ahead. Okay. Okay. My bad. Um,

(4:09:51) it may as well have been a uh a a different a different religion. It may

(4:09:58) as well, you know, Catholicism to the Protestant may as well have been Islam. Um, so it does matter that our nation

(4:10:09) had a separation of church and state and was secular. Yeah. But it did. But it did. But it absolutely did.

(4:10:15) But I've demonstrated to you multiple times it didn't. All you have been able to do is give post hawk justification after the constitution was ratified. We

(4:10:22) already had states that had uh state religions and you claimed that they

(4:10:27) could make laws and discriminate based on those state religions and that was

(4:10:33) perfectly acceptable but somehow this was a secular nation. That literally makes no sense. That's like me saying my

(4:10:39) nation is secular but all the people who live in it are religious. Each state has

(4:10:44) their own federal What was our federal What was our federal religion? What was the

(4:10:50) federal religion? There doesn't need to be a federal religion. It was a perspective given to the states.

(4:10:56) No, the federal Listen, you dimwit. The the Constitution of the United States was designed specifically to say what

(4:11:02) the federal government could not do. I'm sorry, what they could do, not what they could not do.

(4:11:07) They were not allowed allowed to make any type of prescriptive claim on

(4:11:13) religion at the federal level as a compromise to the states. the states were. And you can't say you have a

(4:11:19) secular nation if each one of your states can ratify its own [ __ ] religion, make it the state religion,

(4:11:25) and then bar people from entry based on that state religion. That's the opposite of a secular state.

(4:11:31) So, a the federal government not being able to uh enforce spiritual matters or

(4:11:38) religious matters in the states, you think that that is not secular. All it does is pass the buck to the states to

(4:11:45) enforce those things which they did and they make their own religions and to choose which which religion they would

(4:11:51) like to have as their state religion or to not have what I'm saying is that were the states

(4:11:56) did they all choose the same denomination

(4:12:02) the same denomination I'm going to close my eyes I'm going to close my eyes are popping out because you're talking

(4:12:08) over I am going to create my perfect secular nation what does that look like, Andrew?

(4:12:14) Um, it means that I'm not going to make any prescriptions about religion, but I'm going to let each individual

(4:12:20) province inside of my nation do that, and they can totally discriminate based on their religions because this is a

(4:12:25) secular nation. Does that sound right to you, or does that sound [ __ ] I don't know, [ __ ]

(4:12:31) Oh, I mean, that's the definition of a secular nation. Uh, they allowed they gave they they gave

(4:12:36) states the the decision. They allowed states to That's what a secular nation is to you?

(4:12:41) Yeah. Oh, okay. Well, then if all the United States gave gave the

(4:12:49) So, a secular nation to you is I can create in my state the orthodox religion

(4:12:55) and then discriminate based upon it. That's a secular nation to you. Yeah. The federal government can't stop

(4:13:01) you from doing that. Great. So, you have no problem with individual states creating an orthodoxon, no LGBTQ allowed, make

(4:13:08) prescriptions based on their religion in their state, right? No issues with that because it's a secular nation.

(4:13:13) I don't think we're allowed to do that anymore. Yeah. But but here's the thing. Again, like what I'm saying is that yes,

(4:13:19) the the the federal government was founded on secularism. No, it wasn't.

(4:13:25) They have to they have to leave alone. They have to let you they have to let you stop worship. They can't stop you

(4:13:30) from worshiping. Which of our founders were secularists, do you think? Uh they were all personally Christian.

(4:13:37) Okay. So, uh I'm sorry. This is this is super weird to me. We were founded as a secular nation

(4:13:44) where each one of the states had their own religion which was ratified and and

(4:13:50) recognized by the the federal government and they could discriminate based on the

(4:13:55) policies of that religion in the province of that state and that to you is a secular nation. So right now, if it

(4:14:02) was the case that we had a nation where you had states inside of it that were all orthodox and discriminated based on

(4:14:09) the orthodoxy, that to you is a secular nation, right?

(4:14:14) Uh yes. If the federal government is not enforcing a specific religion,

(4:14:19) great. Then I want more secular nations. I want more. We also secular

(4:14:25) provisions concerning religion. The establishment clause and the free exercise clause. Mhm. Government clause prohibits the

(4:14:31) government from establishing religion. Um they can't establish it. Historically, it meant state prohibiting

(4:14:36) state sponsored churches such as the church of England. Uh right. So the whole nation could have an

(4:14:42) establishment of religion is often governed under the three-part test set for by the US Supreme Court in Lemon versus Curtsman. Under the lemon test,

(4:14:49) government can assist religion only. If one, the primary person, the assistance is secular. The assistance must neither promote nor inhibit religion. And three,

(4:14:56) there is no excessive entanglement between church and state. Um,

(4:15:01) so again, I do not believe that we can establish state religions even if the

(4:15:07) original colonies had them and the first states. I arguing, hang on. We're not arguing

(4:15:13) right now if you can or can't in modernity establish religions inside the states. That's a totally different claim

(4:15:20) than this, Andrew. We were established as a secular nation.

(4:15:26) And what made us a secular nation was that the federal government couldn't make a national religion, but rather

(4:15:33) each state could make a their own religion and then discriminate and do what they wanted based on their

(4:15:38) religious practices and beliefs, including not letting you hold office if you weren't a part of that religion. If

(4:15:44) that to you is a secular state, then I completely concede and want all states

(4:15:49) to be secular. I want exactly that because man what a great thing that was

(4:15:55) for religion. That's I mean that's if that's what a secular state is from Charlie's point of view then that's what

(4:16:01) Andrew Wilson wants more of. Um I mean yes secular states I do think

(4:16:08) that yes federally uh nations nations not enforcing

(4:16:14) a national religion is a positive thing. That's what it that's what it is. That's not what you said. You didn't say it was

(4:16:19) a secular state. We have a secular secular state. Okay. A secular state. Had a secular state. Our like, do you

(4:16:26) deny? Yes. I deny. Do you deny that the that the US government

(4:16:32) Uhhuh. in its inception Uhhuh.

(4:16:37) Do you Holy Holy [ __ ] let me phrase this correctly. Okay. It is a fact correct that

(4:16:45) the United States government in its inception decided to not enforce any religion nationally.

(4:16:52) No. What happened is that the federal government said that states state under

(4:16:59) the 10th amendment the states could adopt their religion and by the way the

(4:17:04) federal government couldn't do [ __ ] about that and that each individual state could discriminate including who

(4:17:10) could hold office based on those religions. They couldn't they could not they could not federally enforce

(4:17:16) Yeah. That's just a separation of powers like saying that is a oh my god like a separation of church and state of church and state.

(4:17:23) Separation of stateates have churches. States have churches.

(4:17:29) Clear this up really quick. A separation of power is not the same as a separation of church and state. Nitwit, you can't say I have a secular

(4:17:35) state where everybody inside of it can make policy based on their religion. That state

(4:17:41) that they all that they all choose on their own. The federal government is not enforcing. Maybe this will help. So it it was the

(4:17:48) 14th amendment came about for uh from what I'm understanding and reading uh

(4:17:53) based on uh like slavery. Yeah. Had nothing to do with any of this. Right. However, it wasn't until the

(4:17:59) court case v. Connecticut in 1940 that was the key case that interpreted the

(4:18:04) 14th amendment to make uh the first amendments uh free exercise clause applicable to state law. So, it wasn't

(4:18:12) until 1940 that that even applied to the states where the states could not uh uh

(4:18:18) infringe upon people's rights to practice their own religion. This still does not change the fact that

(4:18:24) the federal government of the United States. Yes, it would. Never neverationally enforced a

(4:18:30) religion. And let me let me clarify, you have to have it happening for them to have a

(4:18:35) case to go against it. the fact that the US government has never federally

(4:18:41) enforced a national religion. So there's a difference between like state governments. There's like a state

(4:18:47) there's state governments and federal governments. Well, right. We are the Okay. And let me

(4:18:53) we are the United States of America, right? We have a federal representation

(4:18:58) that that we kind of feed into that that it's federalism at its finest, right? So federal government just kind of oversees

(4:19:04) and make sure we're all getting along and playing well. But essentially, we're all individual states with our own

(4:19:10) little bubbles in our own little world. We can make laws that like I can make a law in Maryland that says you can't

(4:19:16) smoke until you're 35. You can't buy cigarettes until you're 35. And the federal government can't come in and be

(4:19:22) like, "No, you can't do that." Yes, I can because we think that's best for our state. However,

(4:19:27) precisely. So, so the federal government has never been allowed to federally enforce or create a religion.

(4:19:33) Yeah. Do you understand though that like they have never the federal government

(4:19:38) cannot Okay, we're gonna have the neighborhood cannot cannot nationally enforce a religion state.

(4:19:46) We're going to take the federal government cannot. Okay, got it. We we now are going to implement the

(4:19:51) United States of Charlie. And the United States of Charlie is just the name we give a neighborhood that

(4:19:58) Charlie establishes. Okay, that you establish. It's just a neighborhood. Here's the rules of the neighborhood.

(4:20:03) Charlie establishes it, right? And Charlie has control, right? Lot of control of this neighborhood.

(4:20:10) As part of your starting charter, you say, "I will not in any way, shape, or

(4:20:15) form infringe on any of you guys having religion inside of any of your

(4:20:21) households." And everybody who comes in there to live happens to be highly

(4:20:26) religious and establishes inside of each of their households religious doctrines which are exclusionary to LGBTQ people

(4:20:33) and all sorts of things with association. You are living in a secular neighborhood, right?

(4:20:40) Because I am not I am not enforcing a religion onto the

(4:20:46) neighborhood and I'm not basing my laws. So it's a secular religion. That's a secular neighborhood.

(4:20:52) Okay. Well, then I based on this definition of secularism want a lot

(4:20:57) [ __ ] more of it. As much of it as we can possibly get. I want everybody to be secularist.

(4:21:04) We have a separation of church and state. So, hey Charlie, I'm h I want more Charlie

(4:21:10) neighborhoods where the secularists found it. The hyper religious come in, they make all sorts of discriminatory

(4:21:16) policy and you just [ __ ] sit there and take it. I want more of that. I want as much of that as I could possibly get,

(4:21:22) Chuck. But weren't we we weren't even like federally acknowledged. So I don't understand. What was your

(4:21:29) what was your thing? Like do you think that the like like the US government is a Christian government?

(4:21:34) Yes. Like we have it is we have federally enforced Christianity. No, I didn't say it was federal.

(4:21:40) Okay. Well, then it's secular. No, that's we have freedom of religion. If if they cannot if if our laws

(4:21:46) if our federal laws Mhm. cannot be based upon religious authority

(4:21:52) and is separate from the church. Oh my god. I am trying to explain to you how

(4:21:58) explain it. Use small words. Deeply frustrating. Oh, use small Oh. Oh, hang on. You're right. You're right. You should explain

(4:22:04) to me how the government works. Cannot make small government Mhm. religious.

(4:22:11) Okay, I got it. Can you just since you're explaining to me how the government works, can you just name the

(4:22:16) three branches of government for me? Uh, legislative, judicial, and executive.

(4:22:22) Got it. What does the speaker of the house do? Speaker of the house is usually Why are you [ __ ] quizzing me on [ __ ]

(4:22:28) Answer the question. What does the speaker of the house do? Wait, no. Wait. This is you. You are

(4:22:33) being Just answer the [ __ ] question. What does the speaker of the house do? God, you're panicking, bro.

(4:22:39) Can you answer what does the speaker of the house do? You are panicking. No, no, no, no, no. I am not going to fall. I am not going to

(4:22:45) fall into your The speaker of the house is kind of

(4:22:50) built into the It's kind of built into the word. It's kind of built into No. Yes. Yes. I know. I know that it is.

(4:22:57) It is like the [ __ ] whatever uh leader majority of of the house. Um

(4:23:02) Well, I mean, you're going to explain civics to me, right? That's what you were saying. You're trying to explain to me how civics work.

(4:23:09) Like, you tell me. You are like like panicking over the fact that the US is

(4:23:15) secular because we don't have an official Speaker, can you tell me what the speaker of the house does? Can you tell me why you think the United

(4:23:21) States of America has a Christian government? Yeah, because most of the people in the government are Christian.

(4:23:27) No. Are our laws informed by Christianity? They are based on Christianity. Yeah. So,

(4:23:33) that's just factually incorrect. Like I feel like you're operating in goooo baba la. So if it was the case that most of

(4:23:39) our government were Muslims, if it were the case that most of our government were Muslims and then they governed

(4:23:45) based on Sharia ethics and passed all Sharia ethical legislation, would you

(4:23:51) say that we had a Muslim government? Uh do you think that every law that we

(4:23:56) can answer the [ __ ] question marriages based upon? I didn't say everyone. That's not what I

(4:24:01) asked you. Can you answer my question? Answer the question then answer the question. I mean again you this is a ridiculous comparison because it is not

(4:24:08) it is not we do not Muslims are democratically elected and because they're democratically elected

(4:24:15) they're in the House of Representatives and they're right and they're in the Senate and they are able to by in a

(4:24:20) bipartisan fashion pass legislation based on their moral Muslim

(4:24:25) fundamentalism. Okay. Would you say we had a Muslim government?

(4:24:34) Do you think that gay marriage answer the [ __ ] question is a Christian? Do you think that gay marriage is a uh is a

(4:24:42) question is a Christian answering his thought on

(4:24:48) let's just ask each other questions if they personally were motivated by their religious beliefs

(4:24:54) uh it would still be secular if it was not based upon Sharia law. However, you cannot argue with all your issues with

(4:25:01) all your issues with the United States of America and the laws that we have regarding trans.

(4:25:07) What were you saying? [ __ ] uh Gretch and Wieners. No, no, no. Is it Big Gretch? Is that who I'm thinking of?

(4:25:12) Yeah, Gretchen. Big Gretch uh is, you know, passing like laws that are like protrans, pro-LGBT.

(4:25:20) And again, we do have these sort of codified in our in our laws at a federal

(4:25:26) level. Do you think that these are Like are these Christian things or are you

(4:25:31) just because they are not Christian things. I would say that if the majority of the government were secular and they were

(4:25:36) passing secular laws that I would consider them to be a secular government. On the other hand, if

(4:25:42) we passing secular laws in some areas, yes. Okay. So the threshold

(4:25:49) we are not like on a widespread level passing Christian law. What does that have to do with anything?

(4:25:54) The question here from you was, would you say most of the government is Christian? Yes. And you said, "What's

(4:26:01) your justification?" I said, "Well, here's my justification." My counter to you was to explain that if you had a majority which passed Muslim laws, would

(4:26:07) you consider a Muslim government? Of course, you didn't answer that question because answering questions for you is an allergy.

(4:26:13) I said no because that would be different. It is not based upon not their

(4:26:18) legislation is not based upon their religion. There's a separation of church and state. I hang on. I got it now. So here's the

(4:26:24) thing then. I actually love this system. So if that's still considered secularism, then I think that we should

(4:26:31) only elect Christians into government to only pass legislation based on their Christianity. And that's secular.

(4:26:40) I mean, good luck because uh you know, like I was saying earlier, there's so many denominations. Um

(4:26:46) my adviser for my dissertation man who is super duper pro-LGBT. like

(4:26:51) your brand of Christianity is a bit more extreme. I don't know. We got abortion outlawed.

(4:26:57) Uh, depends on the state. Um, yeah, I think it's not going to for long

(4:27:03) when the Supreme Court rules that even at the state level they can't do it. And we're getting birthright citizenship

(4:27:09) challenged. You can say good luck, but I've been having pretty goddamn good luck there, Charlie. We've been having a

(4:27:15) lot of really good luck, Chuck. And the thing is, you can't say anything because

(4:27:21) one win in 2022. It's all secular. Hey, that all that abortion stuff that

(4:27:26) happened outlawing that that was secular. It's secular policy. That was indeed secular. Yeah, I agree. More secular policy,

(4:27:33) please. I love this version of secular. This is my favorite. You're probably my favorite secularist that I've ever

(4:27:39) debated with because I can literally concede to all of your secularism as being [ __ ] based and awesome and I

(4:27:45) want more of it. Listen, man. I know what kills you inside. that Christianity is is not the

(4:27:52) uh like the the law of the land here. I know it kills you inside, but you I don't know. Right now, Christianity

(4:27:59) has stated your body, our choice, and we appear to be correct. Huh.

(4:28:05) The Christianity has now stated at the national level, your body, our choice.

(4:28:11) So, I don't know. I feel like uh I feel like we're we're stepping up the W's.

(4:28:16) That's in your universal Christian ethics is what do you mean your body legislation that we passed at nationally

(4:28:22) is secular? Yeah. Yeah. Your body our choice secular

(4:28:30) position. Got to love that. Uh no it's based on states rights at

(4:28:36) this point. Yeah. No, but it's all secular. So states anything us quite literally

(4:28:42) secular. Yes. Anything us Christians pass is secular. I agree.

(4:28:49) Any legislation Christians get together to pass secular immediately. Abortion secular. All the ways that we can rule

(4:28:56) and [ __ ] you people over and we're going to that's all secular. You can't blame Christianity for that. That's secular.

(4:29:03) Um do you think like uh the majority of people who are anti-abortion, do you think every politician was operating

(4:29:09) based upon their own religious principles? Uh, it had nothing to do with politicians. It was a a ruling,

(4:29:16) right? I mean, Roie Wade being overturned was Yeah, that was that was uh that was not

(4:29:23) the American people. Yeah. So, what's your question?

(4:29:29) What I mean is like, do you think those people that had Roie Wade overturned were those Christians?

(4:29:36) You mean the people in the court? Yeah. They turned it over to the states.

(4:29:43) They wanted to turn it over to the states. Yeah, that's great. Yeah. And they did that based on their

(4:29:49) informed Christian ethics of trying to get abort and they were moving towards abortion being limited and not federally

(4:29:56) protected, which definitely assaulted abortion rights. But it doesn't matter because it doesn't matter that they were

(4:30:02) informed in those decisions because they were Christians because they're actually secular.

(4:30:08) Yeah. It's not based on Christianity. You're totally right. There's no more rulings, more

(4:30:15) secularity. That is that is anti-abortion. Look, I love this. Look, I don't even

(4:30:20) know what we're arguing about. I love your system. Your system says that a bunch of religious fundamentalists can take over the entirety of the

(4:30:26) government, rule however they want, and you're going to blame secularists. I [ __ ] love this [ __ ] This is the my favorite. Again, you're my favorite

(4:30:32) secularist I've ever debated with. I love this position. I want I wish that we could write this and enshrine it and

(4:30:39) this definition of secularism into stone. Oh, damn it.

(4:30:47) No, he was he was in a moment. We'll wait. We'll give him a second till

(4:30:53) he uh whatever it does fixes itself.

(4:31:02) We'll give it a second. Um, yeah, I think, you know, I think maybe there's

(4:31:07) some confusion too with the states because when they were originally becoming established, you know, you had

(4:31:14) like your 13 original colonies and so on and so forth, uh, people tended to cling

(4:31:19) to uh their communities, right? And then then eventually the states were developing per that focal point. Um, you

(4:31:27) know, the communities kind of grew bigger and they established this as a state or a colony for instance. Um and

(4:31:33) then eventually it expanded to where they said hey let's become one big united group and you know protect

(4:31:40) ourselves together uh from from you know over the pond. Um and essentially the

(4:31:49) like a lot of those individual places like they just kind of wanted their own little zone so they could do whatever

(4:31:55) they want however they wanted there. We had no we didn't have like interstate travel rights. we didn't have interstate

(4:32:02) uh merchants, you know, laws of of that nature. So that's why you see slavery in

(4:32:09) some states is good and slavery in some states is bad and and some things are accepted and some things are not.

(4:32:15) So federally there was there was no there was no religion nationally

(4:32:20) enforced and that was enshrined in our constitution. because federally enforced religion,

(4:32:26) but that's because the states were were uh established first and they said,

(4:32:32) "Well, up here in Delaware, you know, there's a bunch of Amish. Over here there's a bunch of Catholics. Over here

(4:32:39) there's a bunch of uh you know, right? So like religious like religious freedom. So basically they said, "Hey,

(4:32:45) look, we want to come together, but we're we we already recognize we're all

(4:32:51) different, you know, and separated, but we want to be united." So no, they weren't going to establish this big

(4:32:56) whole umbrella, uh, you know, one religion overall because they still

(4:33:01) acknowledged that we were all different communities of, right? So it was secular. Yeah.

(4:33:07) It wasn't secular. Federally secular. If it was secular,

(4:33:13) hold on. If it was secular, it wouldn't acknowledge that there was religious freedoms to begin with because it

(4:33:20) wouldn't even be saying that religion is a is a thing. It wouldn't even acknowledge it.

(4:33:26) Sorry, what? If it if it was secular, it wouldn't even be recognizing that all of these

(4:33:32) people were doing religious. It wouldn't even we wouldn't have that protection of religious freedom to begin with. we

(4:33:38) would just say, "Well, whatever." You know, like we're not we're not even going to protect you.

(4:33:44) Um, so I I could you both tell me what you think

(4:33:51) secular means? What I'm What I'm saying is is we wouldn't be so hard out on on submitting

(4:33:58) that protection in place in order to acknowledge all of these different states and then we're recognizing that

(4:34:03) we're all different. It just wouldn't. We put all of these protections in place

(4:34:10) like we recognized that was important to us. Our religions were important to us. Yeah. So secular would be

(4:34:16) our individual religions. Yeah. To to practice

(4:34:22) not connected to religious matters. Correct. Yes. Our federal government is

(4:34:27) not connected to religious matters. It allows but that would make that would make it a second practice their own. So it is

(4:34:33) connected to religious matters then it is no it is it is granting freedom of

(4:34:39) religion it is guaranteeing a right so then it's connected to religious matters our laws are not determined by a

(4:34:46) religion and we do not many laws are determined by our religion you're just objectively wrong and at our

(4:34:53) inception they were as well what the word secular means man what does it mean I just gave you a definition give me

(4:34:58) yours secular Mhm. Oh my goodness.

(4:35:04) Uh, waiting for chat to tell you. It is. It is literally No, I'm sorry.

(4:35:11) I'm looking up. I'm seeing if if I need to find you a definition, but I still don't understand how you are not

(4:35:16) understanding this. Give me your definition. Let's see if we can work this thing out.

(4:35:22) It is again, yes, not connected to religion in nature. So you were saying that granting freedom of religion

(4:35:30) would be connected to religion in nature. Yeah.

(4:35:36) So saying that our we will as a nation our laws will not be determined by by

(4:35:42) one religion and that we will allow everyone to practice their own religions. You think that that's secular?

(4:35:48) Yeah. If you allow each one of your states to have their own state religion.

(4:35:54) Okay. and each one of them can make their own policies based on the religion they implement in that state, then what

(4:36:00) you're doing is you're affirming that the federal government has to recognize those religions. The opposite of

(4:36:06) secular. Now, if you had a secular state, what you would do is you would say there's no

(4:36:13) religion allowed to be established and we're not going to recognize any of them. But having to recognize religions,

(4:36:20) there's no federally recognized religion. There's no Yes, there's Why don't you Why don't you fact check your

(4:36:25) claim here? There is no There is no recognized federal. You do not have a national

(4:36:32) religion. I didn't say federal Listen, we do not just religion, man. Why is it

(4:36:37) you don't have a national Nobody's disputing that? I'm I'm just like I am like shook right

(4:36:43) now. What? But we had Being stupid is painful. Being stupid is painful.

(4:36:48) Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. We may not have an over umbrella uh federal religion. We don't. We recognize that.

(4:36:56) But the states did. And the states were who created that protection layer over

(4:37:02) I don't think you guys understand what a secular government is. I don't think you guys know what that means.

(4:37:08) But then wouldn't that states were were religious governments? The states are the ones who created the federal law. It

(4:37:15) is not based upon it was the founding fathers that got together.

(4:37:21) Uh no they didn't. The founding father makes up the who

(4:37:26) the founding fathers didn't get government though. Who makes up the federal government? Who makes that? It's

(4:37:31) the United States. Yeah. See it's representatives from the states. But not only that the founders

(4:37:37) didn't just get together. You guys don't know what a what secular means or what a secular government is.

(4:37:43) Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Yes, it is crazy. You're right about that. Oh my god.

(4:37:49) You're You're totally right about that. It is crazy. Remember the 13 original colonies, right? And that's how we kind of started

(4:37:56) off with these 13 little groups. Well, actually, it all came from the Articles of Confederation. But the thing

(4:38:01) is like the like do you think that this was spontaneous? This was a work in process for years and years and years.

(4:38:08) They all had different they they were practicing different denominations. It's not It's not [ __ ]

(4:38:14) It is a freedom of religion. So the federalally we would have a freedom of religion.

(4:38:19) Yes. So each one of your individual states Oh my god. Yeah. So each one of your individual

(4:38:25) states who has a religion has to be recognized by the federal government. That would be the opposite of a secular state. Dimwit. The opposite.

(4:38:33) That would be the opposite. A secular state would say there's no recognizing of religion. States. So, I need you guys to

(4:38:39) understand that like, okay, I'm going to try to understand allowing individual states to have their

(4:38:44) religions. Mhm. That the federal government of the

(4:38:50) that the federal government of the United States Mhm. Yeah. But that's not what our

(4:38:56) was not sec was was not secular. I don't think you guys not only was it not only was it not

(4:39:02) secular but the first amendment itself it says that that the federal government is not allowed to ratify a national

(4:39:09) religion. That's true. It's we have a secular nation. No, that's not what a a secular nation would be.

(4:39:15) We are allowed to we are just heard you out. I just heard you out.

(4:39:20) If a state if a state ratifies a religion as a state religion and the

(4:39:26) federal government's forced to recognize it, that would not be a secular state.

(4:39:33) So what what you're what have secular doesn't mean that religion is never mentioned. That's not what that

(4:39:40) say. It means religion. That's so saying saying that the United States

(4:39:46) government, our federal government is secular that does not mean they can't say

(4:39:52) anything about religion in the Constitution guaranteeing people and states the right to to their religions.

(4:40:00) Enforcing a federal religion, they had to recognize them. They had to recognize them. That's the

(4:40:07) disconnect. Like if they said, "We're not going to recognize any of your state religions." Sure, I could I could at

(4:40:14) least maybe seed that there's an argument here for uh some sort of secularism. I still think that's a hard

(4:40:20) one. But they literally had to recognize those individual states religions based

(4:40:25) on the 10th amendment. That's the opposite of secular. Opposite. That means I can't use my power to come in

(4:40:33) and tell you that you can't rule religiously. That would be the opposite of secular.

(4:40:39) Our federal government is not based upon a specific religion. So what doesn't need to be?

(4:40:44) They are not. I am telling you what it what it originally did. What it

(4:40:50) originally did was it it gave the states the room to utilize their religion and

(4:40:56) to imply apply it by law accordingly. You could basically say, you know, if

(4:41:01) you're Muslim, we don't want you here. If you're uh you know uh Mormon, we don't want you. You could say those

(4:41:07) things within your state and you're protected by that umbrella on the federal level.

(4:41:12) So aware of that basically all people but it literally allowed the states it

(4:41:20) allowed no it allowed the states to pass laws based off their religions. This is

(4:41:25) why we still have a lot of these crazy dumb like off-the-wall laws, you know, out all sorts of places, right? And like

(4:41:32) you said, there was different religions. There was different religions. It wasn't all the same religion that they picked,

(4:41:38) right? It was different religions. So that government, we live in a secular

(4:41:44) nation that allows you to have your own federal level acknowledged and said,

(4:41:49) "Hey, state over there, if if you want to make laws based off this religion, kick people out because you're going to

(4:41:56) do it because we we're not going to do anything. It's your precisely because it is a secular nation. popular nation.

(4:42:02) But wouldn't that be recognizing that laws can be passed allowing religion

(4:42:08) on a state level? Yeah. And at the federal level? No. Not at the federal [ __ ] level.

(4:42:14) Yes. If you govern all the states come to an agreement with their representatives and their Congress and

(4:42:21) all 50 states are all Christianbased, then yes, you can. Yeah. Do you think every Christian

(4:42:26) denomination is the same? No. That's literally just a different

(4:42:32) It would just be that it wasn't secular at that point, it would have nothing to do with whether or not they had the same

(4:42:38) because there was no specific like oh my god. So you're saying but under your logic if

(4:42:43) every single state was Lutheran all of them were Lutheran let's say but they were not all

(4:42:48) but if they were you would still say that was a secular state. That is that is not what America was founded upon. Our whole thing is you are

(4:42:54) letting people be any kind of Christian or so if everybody chose to be a [ __ ] Lutheran that would still be a secular

(4:43:00) state, right? But if they did, it would still be a secular state, right? But if they did, they would still be But if they did, they would still be a secular

(4:43:07) state. Oh my god. Yeah. Oh my god. If they did, would it still be a secular state?

(4:43:13) If all of the states Yes, of course. So then why oh my god for allowed if they were allowed to be Yes.

(4:43:19) So if all those states which were all Lutheran, So if every one of those states which were all Lutheran all came

(4:43:25) together and they had a constitutional convention and they passed a [ __ ] amendment based on their religion,

(4:43:30) that would still be a secular state, right? The framework of it, bro. It is that would still be a secular state. The

(4:43:36) basis of it. Yes, it is. Okay, good. Okay, good. If that's what you think secularism is, I'm [ __ ] all

(4:43:43) for it. All for it. Okay.

(4:43:50) Yeah, that's how that works. Okay. Glad we understand definitions now.

(4:43:57) I I mean, I'm fine with it. If that's what you consider a secular state, totally fine with it. And if anything

(4:44:04) goes wrong, it's because the secularist did it. Because this is a secular state. So if

(4:44:11) Christians get together and do anything, don't [ __ ] matter. Secularist did it. It's a secular state.

(4:44:18) It is. It is. We have a secular We have a secular country. Okay.

(4:44:23) Mhm.

(4:44:29) There we go. Yeah. I don't I don't really need to go

(4:44:34) anywhere with from here, Sarah. I don't I don't think I do either.

(4:44:45) You remember when the [ __ ] secularists were like super racist and and they um did were doing horrible

(4:44:51) things to black people like not letting them vote and [ __ ] [ __ ] secularists. [ __ ] [ __ ] bastards. Remember when

(4:44:58) secularist killed in our secularist country? Yeah. Do you remember when the secularist killed all the Indians? You

(4:45:04) remember when secularist killed all the Indians? Those [ __ ] secularist [ __ ] happened in our in our

(4:45:09) secularist. Yeah. [ __ ] sec. Yeah, you're right. You remember remember when secularists

(4:45:14) locked up all the Japanese in internment camps in World War II? [ __ ] bastards. That happened in our secular nation.

(4:45:21) Yeah, you're right. I mean, sec but secularist has done nothing but bring peace.

(4:45:26) It's never done anything but bring peace. Um I mean, you're not being [ __ ] killed because of it.

(4:45:32) You're allowed to. What do you think I'd be killed if I What? What do you think if I moved to a different nation that I would be killed?

(4:45:39) be I think that you would be persecuted by who? Where? I think that that in Europe before like

(4:45:45) the secularization of Europe, you would have been persecuted. Absolutely. All of Eastern Europe was Orthodox.

(4:45:51) Nitwit, I wouldn't have been persecuted. No. Yeah, I'm aware. But in any nation

(4:45:57) that wasn't Orthodox? Oh, so any nation that I moved to which had a completely different value set

(4:46:02) than my own, I'd be persecuted. Well, that's a [ __ ] great observation. I didn't know that. So, I need you to like read up on the on

(4:46:10) the Reformation, the Protestant Reformation. Which part would you like me to read up on?

(4:46:16) The part where people were killed over it. The part where people died over differences in Christian denominations.

(4:46:22) I need you to How much is a bunch? Well, let's start with how many is a bunch? How many do you think a bunch is?

(4:46:28) A lot. Yeah, that No, not a lot of people died in the Protestant Reformation. No, that would be incorrect. Maybe you should

(4:46:34) read up on the Protestant Reformation because I it appears that you don't know what the hell you're talking wellcommendation.

(4:46:40) Yeah, give me the recommendation that said a lot of people died during the Protestant Reformation

(4:46:46) cuz uh actually not a lot of people died during the Protestant Reformation. So, there's that.

(4:47:06) It is Peter Marshall's Heretics and Believers. Okay. And how many people

(4:47:12) history of the English Reformation? Okay. Let's see how many people Peter Marshall

(4:47:19) says died during the the uh Reformation. If it's lots and lots,

(4:47:31) thousands.

(4:47:37) Um, due to what? I think it was Bloody Mary herself.

(4:47:45) I'm I'm sorry. Wait a second. Um, you think that Mary killed thousands of

(4:47:51) people? No, she killed like uh 200 or so. Uh-huh. So, not thousands. So, what So,

(4:47:57) what So, what were these what did these thousands die of exactly? Well, it was a uh hundreds of years of or conflict.

(4:48:04) So, a few thousand people died over hundreds of years. That's lots and lots of people.

(4:48:10) I mean, yeah. Killed on purpose. It was also like widespread. Again, like the Reformation was pretty significant.

(4:48:17) Yeah, it was pretty significant. But uh lots and lots of people definitely didn't die due to the Protestant Reformation. That's

(4:48:22) Sorry, I was looking at the English one specifically. Let me look at uh the Protestant Reformation.

(4:48:28) Look at all of it. That's attributed to the Protestant Reformation.

(4:48:37) Ah 7 to 17 million um including the 30 years war and the French wars of

(4:48:42) religion. Yeah. That's not due to uh these are No, that wouldn't be that's not

(4:48:47) reformation. These are religious uh wars. Yeah. It has nothing to do with the reformation. It is. Yeah.

(4:48:53) No. No, it doesn't. No. No. It it is what the 30 years war. Mhm. Yeah. These these people groups,

(4:48:58) they were fighting before there was a Reformation. So, I don't know what you're talking about. But 17 million

(4:49:04) history. You think 17 million people died because of the Protestant Reformation?

(4:49:10) Yeah. And worse related to it? Oh, and wars related to it. Okay. Got it. All right.

(4:49:15) Yeah. How many people do you think died on the Trail of Tears? I think you I think you need to I think

(4:49:20) approximately so 60,000 were moved. I can't remember precisely how many died

(4:49:26) along the way. Um but 60,000 people were uh were were moved.

(4:49:31) How many people you think died in the triliters? How many do I think? Mhm.

(4:49:37) Um probably

(4:49:42) 10,000 I'm willing to bet based upon like afterwards.

(4:49:48) Um not along the way upon the trail, but I mean afterwards. So that would not that would be not on

(4:49:55) the trail of tears then? How many people died on the trail of tears? A consequence of the trail of tears. Okay. So, but how many people died on

(4:50:01) the trail of tears? I don't know how many how many did. I'm asking you.

(4:50:06) Okay. Do you want me to look it up for you? You can't type. You don't know. It's okay to not know things. That's okay.

(4:50:12) I know. Yeah, I'm comfortable not knowing things. Okay. So, about 4,000 died um during the the

(4:50:22) journey. You sure it wasn't millions and millions?

(4:50:28) Uh I mean the the English Reformation has like a thousand deaths attribute to it, I think.

(4:50:33) And then 7 to 17 million for the Protestant Reformation all over all over Europe. So yes, I don't know how to tell

(4:50:39) you this during massive European land. The Protestants, the Protestants and the Catholics were indeed killing each other.

(4:50:45) Yeah, they didn't. Protestants and Catholics weren't killing each other over being Protestant and Catholic to the range of 17 million. That's insane.

(4:50:51) You're talking about massive European land wars, which you're then in a post hawk way trying to attribute that

(4:50:57) specifically to religious differences instead of actual land war differences between people, groups that had been fighting for hundreds of years. Do you

(4:51:04) think that those land land wars have nothing to do with religion

(4:51:09) as well as the who has the authority to own that land? Like I don't think you you like

(4:51:16) that that was a whole there was a lot of beef about that. Yeah, there was a lot of beef about that long before even when they were a

(4:51:23) unified religion under Catholicism and then later Anglicanism. But the basis of this conflict was in

(4:51:29) fact religious. It was Protestant versus Catholic. Yeah. So the thing is though is that and

(4:51:34) before that it was English versus French, right? And before that it was Nordic versus uh you know [ __ ]

(4:51:40) my brother in Christ. My brother in Christ. I think that you you really need to I'm not your brother in Christ. You're a

(4:51:46) secularist lunatic. So I don't know what you're talking about. I need to rearch in Christ.

(4:51:52) Brothers and sisters in Christ. No. If you're a member of the church, you're my sister in Christ. I was baptized. So

(4:51:58) baptized into which church? Uh, non-denominational. Oh, see, there's about to be another

(4:52:03) [ __ ] Protestant Reformation right now. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. All right,

(4:52:14) I'm good. I'm like, I'm fine leaving it there. Okay,

(4:52:20) I'm good. We like to go through some super chats. Sure.

(4:52:28) Okay, I'm probably gonna have to do 10 and up.

(4:52:39) Yeah, we'll start with 10 and we'll see how see how fast we can move through those.

(4:52:45) Okay, you're more than welcome to respond to any of them or you're more than welcome to stay quiet as well. Um,

(4:52:51) if we do respond, quick and concise is helpful. Uh that way we can get through more. Uh [ __ ] Wrangler with the Big 10

(4:52:58) says, "Andrew weaponizes the forms of rational discourse against reason itself. He is the face of intellectual

(4:53:05) evil." Darth Wilson. What a name. I've been told that that uh I weaponized

(4:53:12) the form of rational discourse against reason itself. Fair enough. Uh how long Nate with the

(4:53:19) big 50 says, "Water is what determined where the settlers built towns in the prairies and deserts. Now days we pipe

(4:53:26) water thousands of miles and produce drinking water by producing sewage. Water was more important than money

(4:53:33) without modernity. Yeah, that's true. And oftentimes we we still have trouble pumping it. For

(4:53:39) instance, just take Las Vegas. Yeah.

(4:53:45) Uh, still born uh with the Big 10. I drove I I drive a crew cab three

(4:53:54) 3500 DY Duramax because it was the truck I grew up in. I'll drive this truck

(4:53:59) until it falls apart from the Michigan salt and I'll rebuild it to keep it going forever.

(4:54:04) It's handy dandy. Uh Josh Brook says, "Hey Chuck, don't hate on my big old beautiful truck that

(4:54:10) I use for everything. Have you ever heard of the phrase, it's better to have it and not need it than to need it and

(4:54:16) not have it? That's why that had to do with the the big car talk with the bigger families. Sorry about your truck.

(4:54:26) Uh Matt says, "Who the f is this woman worries about the what others choose? Is

(4:54:32) she the arbiter of what we can and can't buy? She's got to approve mind your own business. Lunatic leftists. Shots fired.

(4:54:42) Uh, airborne animal says, "It is amazing just how wrong liberals progressives are. Capitalism is freedom. The freedom

(4:54:49) to trade your time and labor freely and openly with others. That the state does

(4:54:54) not own you nor your labor. It's also liberalism is is pro-

(4:55:00) capitalism. Yeah. But progressivism is not. No. Correct. And the thing is is like I

(4:55:07) would say and I I would make this affirming argument to anybody that um if

(4:55:13) you really want the the idea of freedom then you need to be able to own land and

(4:55:18) property and that that has been the distinction between nobility and peasants uh since essentially the dawn

(4:55:24) of time is those who control land control the management of resources and can control your labor. And I think that

(4:55:32) under the capital the idea of private land ownership which is a fairly new idea for the commoner is now achievable

(4:55:39) and that was only made possible through capitalism. And that's uh that's that's why I avidly resist communists who would

(4:55:47) uh they would take all public publicly owned land and then they would try to

(4:55:52) divide it and just create a brand new a brand new cast system which would be 10 times worse than the thing that they're

(4:55:57) trying to stop. So, and you were you were adding something

(4:56:03) in, Charlie. Oh, just that uh liberalism by its uh

(4:56:08) you know, by its core tenants would be pro- capitalists. It's it's what the exercise of individual freedoms. So, I

(4:56:14) was just correcting that chatter and they said liberals hate capitalism. No, it's liberalism is is pro- capitalism.

(4:56:20) That's fair. It's fair. PT Reed says, "Andrew, our hospital systems did this

(4:56:25) to us. They kicked doctors out have become lobbying monopolies in collusion

(4:56:31) with socialistic polit politicians to rip us all off.

(4:56:37) Uh Hall says our latestage capitalism is actually a new economic form called

(4:56:42) corporatism. The closest historical form was mercantalism.

(4:56:48) Uh capitalism fixed mercantalism. Corporatis. I haven't heard of that. Is that a thing?

(4:56:55) Um Corporatism is a is definitely a thing. Merkantilism uh was the kind of common state for most

(4:57:02) of human history. That was pre- capitalism capitalism in a way. Almost everywhere there's going to be two

(4:57:08) people to trade with each other. There's going to be a form of mercantalism including in communism. Corporatism is a

(4:57:14) structure that you can I mean this has been equated to fascism before that that was a structure of corporatism. I don't

(4:57:20) think that we're in the full throws of corporatism. Though I do think that progressive governments have done more

(4:57:26) to try to weaponize uh corporations for social issues than anything I could ever have imagined in my lifetime. The fact

(4:57:33) that they get so many corporations on for on board with LGBTQ and other social

(4:57:38) uh you know social dynamics in arenas and then I'm sure those corporations get all sorts of kickbacks from these

(4:57:45) progressives who are in office through tax breaks and everything else. I would say that it's uh it's the closest thing

(4:57:50) to the very fascism that they hate and yet they're the biggest propagators of it.

(4:57:56) Uh well, I would say that I mean I think I I certainly noticed this year that corporate pride has kind

(4:58:03) of uh certainly not as as popular as it once was. And that's because public

(4:58:08) opinion is shifting away from being pro-LGBT in many spaces. So I feel that

(4:58:14) it's not so much the uh you know mass enforcement of of pro-LGBT thought. It

(4:58:21) is simply whatever is going to make them the most money. Um it's a it's it's a

(4:58:27) profit driven motive not human. But if it if it is the case that your profits

(4:58:34) will be maximized through social justice and you get government kickbacks and that assists you then I think that you

(4:58:40) would probably move your corporation towards that and that's what happens with NOS's especially NOS's get huge

(4:58:47) grants from government agencies in many cases that we've been able to track down non-government organizations and they're

(4:58:52) the ones who work handinhand with these corporations. So it's like even it may not be the the government itself

(4:58:58) directly granting money to these corporations but if you look at all the back dealing with NOS's and how much

(4:59:03) NOS's work with these corporate entities it's very clear the government is filtering money to them.

(4:59:09) Well yeah yeah so profit you know yeah the mo and in this case the motive

(4:59:16) is profit through government. So I would I would say that this chatter is

(4:59:21) very astute and he's pointing out something which is a significant problem and uh that is the fact that most of

(4:59:28) this is government interlocators with NOS's that cause these problems. I would say it would also um maybe

(4:59:34) behoove uh both him and perhaps you this is not disagreeing with either of you in

(4:59:39) any capacity but uh goodness I can never say his name. It's a Greek name. It's a

(4:59:46) technofudalism by Yianis Veracus um which I think is uh kind of examining

(4:59:55) the the way corporatism is working uh in the age of technology. Um which is it's

(5:00:01) [ __ ] scary and weird. Um interesting stuff though.

(5:00:07) Airborne says one legal immigrants are a net positive to the country. Illegal immigrants are a net negative. They love

(5:00:14) to muddy this water. Uh, if having kids is so expensive, why do poor people have so many children?

(5:00:22) I mean, it is expensive. We could argue that. I don't know. Were they poor before they had kids or did

(5:00:28) having kids make them poor? No, they were poor before they had kids, right?

(5:00:35) Well, I mean, it is expensive to have children. Are we going to deny that? Like, child care costs are are very

(5:00:40) high. Like, it's it's expensive to have kids. It seems like it would be a lot less expensive if uh men dominated the

(5:00:47) workforce and women stayed home with their children. That seems like it would be way less expensive. Uh I mean, yeah, but we don't live in an

(5:00:54) economy anymore where that's like a one parent, one income household is like economies are scalable. Economies are

(5:01:00) scalable. Imagine saying you have so much so many jobs that you can employ both sexes, but one sex tomorrow quits.

(5:01:07) What happens to men's wages? What would happen to men's wages if all women dropped out of the workforce tomorrow?

(5:01:14) Um well obviously wages would go up just like when the black peg during like I think it was 14th century got killed

(5:01:21) onethird killed onethird of Europe. Correct. And what happened to peasants and what happened to peasants wages?

(5:01:27) They had more leverage and power and they were able to buy land. They were able to buy land. It's what killed the feudal system.

(5:01:33) Yeah. But there are probably too many uh you know industries that are female

(5:01:40) dominated that are necessary that would just kind of things would go haywire. Well then just keep the uh keep them in

(5:01:46) the essential roles for those things like um oh I don't know like nursing.

(5:01:51) Yeah. Yeah. And caregiving. Yeah. Just keep them in those roles. All the waitresses all that [ __ ] They all go they uh they

(5:01:57) they move out of the workforce. Men's wages double actually probably triple overnight. and suddenly it becomes

(5:02:04) achievable, especially when you don't have to pay for childare. It almost seems like the progressive idea of destroying the traditional family was a

(5:02:11) really bad [ __ ] idea. It almost seems like now uh just trying to have a family is so expensive you get priced out of

(5:02:18) it. Yeah, you do. Yeah, but I think that's trickled on economics. Anyway,

(5:02:24) you guys went through so many topics the super chats are all over the place. Powder dusty with the Big 10. Legalizing

(5:02:29) drugs wasn't the issue. legalizing crimes with victims was legalize all

(5:02:34) drugs. Uh Dwight says Charlie said she grew up

(5:02:41) in a poor rural town. Didn't she say her dad was a doctor? I thought docs made a

(5:02:46) good salary. Yeah, I made it come later. Yeah. Yeah.

(5:02:52) You can also live in a poor town and not be poor yourself. That's true. Yeah, that's true. You can be the one in

(5:02:59) the mansion. Uh, Timbo says, "Go live in Southside Chicago. Multiculturalism

(5:03:05) sucks." Hunter says, "I will not protect my household. I will not protect anyone in

(5:03:11) my household, but I will go to the bathroom with the door open to show how much of a alpha I am."

(5:03:17) This is always making fun of Hunter Avalone. That's funny.

(5:03:23) Uh, Josh says, "Well, honey, no one person has permission to take somebody else's life. If the state matching

(5:03:29) actions is objectively fair. Believe this was in the context of murder. You

(5:03:35) guys were down that route. Hall says, "Charlie Chuck, we waste the time of 80% of students class time

(5:03:42) trying to help third world students catch up." It's true. Most most teaching environments

(5:03:48) appeal to the lowest common denominator. It's a terrible policy. I mean, yeah, but yeah, it's a no child

(5:03:56) left behind thing. That's a that's a Bush era policy which is like not great.

(5:04:01) I don't think it's third world students necessarily though. Um I've done some

(5:04:06) substitute teaching and it was uh you know American children typically that I

(5:04:12) would teach and it was the same it's the same premise. Was it though like when you had non-English speakers in the classroom

(5:04:18) they didn't take up a disproportionate amount of resources? Uh they usually went to other classrooms. Um they too so they were

(5:04:24) taking up a disproportionate amount of resources. Yeah. You get No. Well, they were not disrupting the

(5:04:29) other children. The children that were uh you know kind of slowing everyone and everything down were the children that

(5:04:36) surprising amount of kids like really cannot read. Like there was a lot of the 10-year-olds in the the classes that I

(5:04:41) would sub for sometimes where they just they could like they can't read. Middle school you usually have periods,

(5:04:47) right? Just like in high school where you got first period, second period, third period. Right? If that's the case that you have

(5:04:53) individual teachers for each one of these things, then wouldn't you need to have individual teachers also for non-English-speaking students? How could

(5:05:00) that not disproportionately absorb resources? Um, I mean, I'm not sure. I I don't know

(5:05:07) how these things like Well, that's a separate salary. December

(5:05:13) salary that you have to pay now because you have to provide and because of the IEP systems and everything like that now

(5:05:20) you have to provide uh all funding and factors like in the state of

(5:05:26) Maryland they demand uh like the county provides all factors for uh special ed

(5:05:32) uh uh different uh language speaking so on and so forth and they accommodate to

(5:05:38) every particularity of every child that comes to the school and the school has to or the county has to fund it. So if

(5:05:45) they're speaking a different language now we have to fund an entirely extra salary. Uh that would essentially maybe

(5:05:52) I'm just saying about the teaching materials themselves like how much you have to invest. I mean I went to schools with you know

(5:05:58) people who spoke different languages who spoke English as a second language. Um, I mean, it's kind of just like people

(5:06:06) move and you do have to, you know, uh, try to accommodate in some capacity.

(5:06:12) Also, I think it's good for children in special ed programs, too. I I think that disabled children should have some level

(5:06:18) of education. I think that's good, right? We're on like the we're on like team like like disabled children. I'm

(5:06:24) just pointing out to you that there's no reason for you to import migrants who don't speak the language and put a

(5:06:31) disproportionate uh burden on our uh school system and thus divert attention

(5:06:38) away from the children who are already there. That just that's so sill. Again,

(5:06:44) these are just such silly policies which are all under the gospel of diversity when it just doesn't even make sense.

(5:06:50) It's not like it's not like I'm out here saying Having a diverse [ __ ] you

(5:06:56) know, grouping of people is evil. See, it's just like can can we even introduce

(5:07:02) common sense? Like I wouldn't I wouldn't run a corporation where everybody spoke

(5:07:07) different languages if I was like having a construction crew or something like obviously that would be detrimental to

(5:07:14) whatever crew I was running and whatever capacity I was running if my workforce didn't speak the same language,

(5:07:19) right? But if your children like moved, if you guys moved to

(5:07:24) Germany, like if you and your family moved to Germany, like you would you would need your children to be in like a

(5:07:31) you know, English second language program. Correct. True. Yeah. So the thing is is like this would but this is controlled with

(5:07:37) inflows and outflows. So the idea is like sure there's missionaries who move to Japan and their kids definitely get

(5:07:44) special resources uh inside of these schools so that they can learn to speak Japanese and things like this.

(5:07:51) But here's the thing. If if you have a part of your educational budget which is associated

(5:07:57) with that and it's a really small portion so that you can take on students like that, that's fine. By controlling

(5:08:02) the inflow of how many come in, we take in a million a year. a million a year.

(5:08:09) That's [ __ ] insane. And we have tons who come up who aren't even documented at all. Many of them speak none of the

(5:08:15) language. It's like that's an insane policy. And it seems like you're just driving incentives to them to come here

(5:08:21) illegally if you're willing to make accommodations in your school system to for the people who aren't even supposed to be here. It's like it's just so

(5:08:28) silly. I think that I would need to see some definitive proof that like ESL

(5:08:35) students are like severely disrupting the learning of English speaking

(5:08:40) students. That's not what that's not what was stated though because I think disproportionate amount of resources I

(5:08:46) can demonstrate for you. Sure. Yeah. just that again um

(5:08:53) well even if you look at the schools that are you know maybe uh smaller towns

(5:08:58) that don't have the the budget and resources to be able to utilize uh you

(5:09:03) know like they would have a harder time providing the same things for that child as they would for anyone else.

(5:09:09) Yeah. So re even though I would think that this was just common sense, um research research and experience

(5:09:15) indicates English language learners require additional educational resources

(5:09:20) to support their language development and academic success. Reasons the initial need for additional resources.

(5:09:27) Well, no shock there. Insufficient funding. Oh, well, yeah, insufficient funding. Why? Because you're trying to teach, you know, your

(5:09:34) English- speakaking students. um teacher created resources. There's

(5:09:39) all sorts of different reasons why, but of course they require more resources. Like it's just common sense, isn't it?

(5:09:45) Do we like do you really need a study for this? Yes. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's fine. I just want to be like, is it like

(5:09:51) significantly disrupting? Because again, I went to school with people who had to go to the ESL classes during parts of

(5:09:57) the day and it was Oh, yeah. If you segregate all not really like a big issue, but even when they were in like our math classes,

(5:10:04) like it was fine. Um, I would also say that, you know, as a nation that

(5:10:11) historically brought together a bunch of people that spoke a bunch of different languages, like it makes sense that we

(5:10:16) would, you know, kind of have this sort of infrastructure, right?

(5:10:21) No. No. First of all, there used to be laws which govern the use of language,

(5:10:27) right? Like you couldn't go into certain shops because they had the freedom of association. You don't speak English,

(5:10:33) you can't [ __ ] shop here. US bought California we were supposed to have like all of our legislation both in English

(5:10:39) and Spanish. So even if that's true, which I doubt, but even if it is true, um the thing

(5:10:45) that I would point out here is that so what? You can have all sorts of stupid policies that are just clearly stupid

(5:10:52) policies. It's a really stupid policy to create incentives for people uh to come

(5:10:57) into your nation illegally or to not adapt. It's like look, if you if you're a migrant in Japan, you're expected to

(5:11:04) speak the language. That's the expectation and that you learn it very quickly. That is not the expectation

(5:11:09) that's going on now. In former waves of immigrants, that was the expectation. You don't you can't come in here if you

(5:11:14) don't speak the [ __ ] language. People weren't accommodating them, you know, they weren't being super accommodating

(5:11:20) towards whatever their needs were. You actually had to integrate into the social form of society.

(5:11:27) I mean, do you I feel like all the kids I I knew that spoke another language,

(5:11:33) they did they did adapt and accommodate and they don't adapt. Look at the Why don't

(5:11:38) you just look at the uh distinction in rates of literacy between the uh ESL

(5:11:45) students who come in who are Hispanic and this and that in comparison to the to other demographics. is like, "No,

(5:11:51) they definitely they definitely have massive disadvantages and take a lot of resources up." It's not to say that

(5:11:57) literacy rates are terrible, but they can communicate generally like that that the children it's like also ESL is there

(5:12:03) to help them adapt, is it not? Well, I mean, kind of. It's like it's a it's a way to help them

(5:12:08) learn how to speak English so that the thing is is like assimilate into into American society, but why not why not just have an inflow

(5:12:15) that's really small of non-English-speaking people? Uh, and if you do select for migrants because you

(5:12:21) need a migrant labor force, why not select from a very culturally similar English-speaking migrants, that just

(5:12:27) makes sense because like the English or the South Africans

(5:12:33) or New Zealanders or Australians to we don't really why did they don't need to

(5:12:39) migrate. Yeah, [ __ ] right. People are immigrating from poor countries. If you offered up the same amount of incentive programs to

(5:12:46) Australians to move to the United States, they'd take you up on that [ __ ] in 5 seconds. And so would a lot of

(5:12:52) people in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, but not just them. A lot of the Asian nations would do the same thing.

(5:12:58) They'd take you up on it and do. So it's like, yeah, they would. Yeah. Actually, I think if you had as many incentive

(5:13:04) programs for Australians to come to the United States, I bet you'd empty out half of [ __ ] Australia tomorrow. I

(5:13:10) bet you'd empty out half of it. If Australia was poor. No, I didn't say poor. I said if you

(5:13:16) offer the same incentive immigrating here because they get very very luxurious

(5:13:23) care packages when it comes to health care, when it comes to education, when

(5:13:28) it comes to all sorts of different things, including social welfare. But the thing is is that right now if you

(5:13:34) want to immigrate here from Australia, it's a [ __ ] nightmare. Same thing from Canada. Not so hard. If you're

(5:13:39) coming up from South America and you just say, "Hey, uh, I'm a [ __ ] refugee." And you just disappear right

(5:13:45) into the nation. It's like, it's the most convenient thing on planet Earth. And if you were able to make it as easy

(5:13:52) for Australians to get here as you did people in South America, I bet half of it would empty into the United States.

(5:13:57) Half. Same thing with Canada. I bet half of Canada down here. Severely overestimating uh how much

(5:14:04) people want to live in in America. Yeah. Well, who's moving out? Um, it ain't none of the liberals who keep

(5:14:09) promising us they promising us they will when Trump gets elected. They ain't [ __ ] moving out. They keep promising

(5:14:15) Trump gets elected we're leaving and they don't ever [ __ ] go nowhere. It's hard to immigrate.

(5:14:21) Yeah, exactly. So, if we made it easy for Australians to immigrate, I bet they [ __ ] immigrate. That's my point.

(5:14:28) It's uh it's easier in the US than it is for the other places. Oh [ __ ] his thing tapped out again.

(5:14:36) Ah, I definitely know it's not me because you're staying and I'm staying. It's not It's not us.

(5:14:43) It's his system. It's just his system. Uh, Aal Long says George W. Bush passed

(5:14:50) what the educational unions asked for. He just wanted the states to pay for it.

(5:14:55) Uh, Airborne says states have low, average, and high pay for all teachers

(5:15:01) by position. Early, excuse me, early childhood, elementary, etc. Liberals

(5:15:06) only look at the things through the lens of race. It's almost like they are dot dot dot.

(5:15:13) I gota be I I'm so tired. I'm so super duper I'm very EP. Um would

(5:15:21) it be all right if I if I bounced? I didn't think it was going to be No, it's totally okay. I give you credit

(5:15:27) for staying on this long. If you need to go, you need to go. Thank you for having me. I um Did you want to send your final thoughts

(5:15:33) out to anyone? um to the crowd that we we discussed so many issues

(5:15:40) that was we covered so many things. Um

(5:15:46) final thoughts.

(5:15:57) I think that if if you are feeling the need, random people in in the audience,

(5:16:04) to come to my Twitter and bother me,

(5:16:10) you should do something better with your time, call your mom,

(5:16:15) clean your room, do do the dishes.

(5:16:20) Just more productive things to do. All right. Thank you. Thank you for having me. I'm tapping out. I'm sleepy.

(5:16:28) Thank you, Right. Good night, everyone. I appreciated the convo. I wasn't

(5:16:33) expecting it to get all debatey there, but I guess it only did at the end, so not too bad. It was It was interesting.

(5:16:39) Yeah, I had fun. Good. I got more perspectives, so that was cool.

(5:16:45) Yeah, we're not uh over on this side, we're not nearly so crazy as we're made out to be, but rather we it always just

(5:16:53) seemed to me like we have really good reasons to believe the things that we believe and that they are indeed true

(5:16:58) and that we're not some like frothing at the mouth lunatics, but rather um we we

(5:17:04) have some pretty good reasons to be kind of upset with the way that the country is, especially under progressive

(5:17:10) ideology. That's all I really hope to convince you of.

(5:17:15) All right. No, I I I get that. I understand your reasonings. I understand your thought process. That's all I could

(5:17:21) ask for. Appreciate it. All right. Good night, everyone. Thank you for having me, Charlie. Bye.

(5:17:26) Have a wonderful night. Thank you. You, too. Bye. Bye. Um, are you making your exit, too? If

(5:17:33) not, I'm going to kick back to the super chats again. Well, I mean, we got to finish your super chats.

(5:17:38) Okay, fair enough. Um, okay. Uh, we just did that. Gester all just in time for

(5:17:44) Andrew to make his appearance back on screen, says the Big 20, Smoky Man bad,

(5:17:50) bad Smoky Man. And just to say again, much appreciation to Charlie and Palpatine for the conversation tonight.

(5:17:56) Yes, it went really well. It wasn't until the tail end when it got a little feisty.

(5:18:02) I'll say that. Uh Hall says uh JLBB I think he meant uh

(5:18:09) he corrected it later uh but also started the programs in the projects offering money to women who didn't live

(5:18:14) with a man. More children, more money, more children, more money if there's not

(5:18:20) a man in the home. Two generations later, mass incarceration of men who had

(5:18:25) no fathers. And massive incentive, too. Massive incentive. uh you wouldn't get the welfare in these various programs if you

(5:18:32) were if you had too much money coming in. In fact, there's still people who game the system that way. They'll be

(5:18:37) like, "You have to quit your job. We'd make more money on welfare." It's not a joke. Like that really happens.

(5:18:43) Yeah. Uh, and I think it's also built in to where uh when you are receiving

(5:18:50) um like if you are receiving welfare or something along those lines uh and maybe you're out of work or you haven't worked

(5:18:56) or whatever the case may be. Uh there's no incentive to go back into the workforce because you're making more off

(5:19:03) of uh the handouts than you would if you went and worked uh eight hours a day.

(5:19:08) It's kind of it's it hurts. It hurts at the idea that people can do that. Uh Josh says there's a great website for

(5:19:14) statistics in Chicago. I c can't put it on here. Won't let me send the message, but Google hey Jack and the word for

(5:19:21) donkey. Hey jackass. Um I'm going to skip a few. Uh Z says

(5:19:26) with the big 50 as a black Gen Z man. Andrew is correct. He understands the

(5:19:31) culture and history of our struggles. This girl comes off as arrogant. It is very distasteful how disingenuous she is

(5:19:38) being about our struggles with our single motherhood culture. culture, leftist ideology.

(5:19:44) Look, I've always I've always thought that black people were pretty [ __ ] based. Honestly, I always thought that the c culture socially

(5:19:52) um that there was always this massive problem there. And the massive problem always looked to me like uh it became

(5:19:58) far too matriarchal instead of patriarchal. And um and that that sort of

(5:20:04) lopsidedness created 99% of the problems that you see and still does.

(5:20:10) I thought this one was funny. Andrew should start a band with Jake. They can call it Syndrome of a town. Gre,

(5:20:19) you've got a goofy chat for sure. Um, let's see. I want to skip down. Skip

(5:20:25) down. Select. Sorry. All right. Uh, what the hell? This is

(5:20:32) basic history. The colonies were set up by people wanting to escape religious persecution and make religious

(5:20:38) societies. The founders protected state official religions from conflicting federal official religion.

(5:20:45) Exactly. That was the whole point. It's not a secular state. It's just silly. Yeah, that one.

(5:20:50) That was the silliest [ __ ] That was the silliest [ __ ] I ever [ __ ] heard. Yeah, that one definitely definitely

(5:20:56) hurt a little bit. Mike says with the big 50, "Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political

(5:21:02) prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. Reason and

(5:21:07) experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in

(5:21:12) exclusion of religious principle." Washington because they couldn't base anything on

(5:21:18) anything. Even Loach couldn't. They couldn't base any of their morals on anything except religion and they knew it.

(5:21:24) Yeah. Uh, this was a good one. Freedom of religion, not from religion. That's

(5:21:30) not secular. Holy crap. Laughing my ass off. Yeah, that one hurt. Uh, Raz, if

(5:21:37) you're in a neighbor, remember, if you're in a neighborhood that you start,

(5:21:42) that was just so wild. All right, it was it was even I felt really smart

(5:21:48) in that moment. That doesn't happen very often. Raz says, "Hot take Freemasonry

(5:21:53) was the national secular religion as the Protestant pseudo monastic monastic

(5:21:59) order. They were intermediaries between the government and the sea of Protestant denominations."

(5:22:06) Yeah, that's actually there's a lot of truth to that and the idea in Freemasonry that all you have to have is

(5:22:11) a higher power. It created a unity in some cases where uh they could all get

(5:22:17) together even from different denominations had an excuse to do that. So that there is actually some truth there.

(5:22:23) I like that. Uh the right of religion res was reserved for states and the

(5:22:29) people since all of the states collectively had recognized state religions that made the entire country

(5:22:36) religious. Logic 101. Yeah, that one that one really did like

(5:22:42) I don't know. I'll just I'll keep my words to myself. Uh

(5:22:48) um more more people have been killed by post-modern secular wars, civil war and revolutions of the 20th century than all

(5:22:55) religious wars in earth's history. Really? Yes.

(5:23:01) I mean I the 20th century under secularism was not a time of peace. Okay. I don't know.

(5:23:07) I don't know where this idea comes from that like secularism brought in the most peaceful societies. It [ __ ]

(5:23:13) definitely didn't. Wow. That's interesting. I would I would

(5:23:18) almost want to like break down like all of the battles, wars, so on and so forth and see what actually that's been done.

(5:23:24) Is it really? Yeah, you can just Yeah, it's been done. I got to Google this later. Uh Carrie

(5:23:30) says, "No, the US government was not founded as a completely secular entity in modern sense." That that that's

(5:23:37) Google's answer when searched. was the US government found.

(5:23:46) They just hear and repeat. Like people just hear and repeat. They don't even think about what it is that they're hearing.

(5:23:51) Well, I think I think you kind of hit the nail on the head when you asked cuz she said, "Well, you guys don't even know what secular means." And then you

(5:23:58) said, "Well, well, do you, you know, define it?" And I think that that's where maybe there was some uh skewed

(5:24:04) vision going on there on secularism and what it stands for and what it means. Like yeah, we understand there's a

(5:24:10) separation of government and religion, but that's not the federal government was a representation of what the states

(5:24:17) wanted and the states wanted religious reign within their states. It was it was

(5:24:23) an overhaul. Um the US is an example of secularism. The problem is extending that to say we are a secular nation.

(5:24:31) That implies secular people, states, laws. That isn't the case and definitely wasn't at the founding.

(5:24:41) US is an example of secularism. The problem is extending that to say that we are a secular nation implies.

(5:24:47) Uh, no. I look, the thing that's interesting is that you could there's

(5:24:53) constitutions that we can point to and there's various ratifications we can point to where the language was really

(5:25:01) clear on what the goal was, which was to uh basically have a nation which was

(5:25:07) free of religion or free from religion or something like this. Our constitution really didn't have that. her

(5:25:12) constitution instead was just compromising between the states natural distrust of the federal government um

(5:25:20) which remember they had had to make a compromise because uh they had had the articles of confederation before that

(5:25:27) which I mean basically the states had all the rights in power. So in order to have a federal government at all the the

(5:25:34) idea for the federal government had to be compromised. They had to compromise on everything and the states distrusted them. So the states demanded, they were

(5:25:42) demanding that the federal government not make a national religion because then the states couldn't make religions

(5:25:49) that they wanted. It's it's the opposite of secularism and it's just like the idea just ignores all of history. Well,

(5:25:56) ignores US history. Fair enough. Uh Red Fox says chimpanzees

(5:26:02) are 98.8% and bonobos are 98.7%

(5:26:07) similar to humans. Andrew's debate prep is crazy good. Not one step back.

(5:26:13) Yeah, you're right. It is crazy good. Yeah, chimpanzees. I knew it. I knew that they were the closest. I was like,

(5:26:19) wait, wait. I think it is chimpanzees who are the closest, but anyway. Okay. Thank you.

(5:26:24) Scott said she said she's against selective breeding, not breeds per se. You can have natural breeds suited for

(5:26:30) service positions without having to selectively breed for them. But isn't that how they got to being those breeds?

(5:26:38) Yeah. The thing that's the thing is like uh basically all of the breeds that you would say uh are natural breed. Well,

(5:26:46) which ones? What's the natural breed? I was reading an article the other day that basically uh 70 or 80% of wild dogs

(5:26:53) end up becoming like one composition of the dog that they call like the African dog or whatever. Um but left in their

(5:27:01) kind of natural form. Um they it all kind of devolves into one thing like

(5:27:06) wolves. It's the same [ __ ] there. Where's all the why why aren't wolves becoming like smaller puppy dogs? You

(5:27:12) know what I mean? It requires the selective breeding to begin with to get that species moving in the direction

(5:27:18) that you want. That was the point. And by the way, I I'm not a like the

(5:27:23) opposite of eugenics. I was just pointing out that if you make a eugenics argument under the idea of I have a

(5:27:28) trait and that trait's moral because that's the trait, then you could just easily select for any of these traits

(5:27:33) and say they're moral and just get rid of it, right? And that takes out the whole Yeah, that makes

(5:27:39) sense. Well, that's all I'm going to read for the night. It's almost 3:00 a.m. for me.

(5:27:44) Same. Yeah, it was fun. Yeah, I appreciate it. It was a very, very long debate. Um, but I appreciated

(5:27:52) you hosting them. She's got a couple she's hosting back to back, by the way, later in the week as the Rondo of Blood

(5:27:59) continues. uh 200,000 subscribers

(5:28:04) over here on the Crucible. It was uh it's been a hell of a a fight on the way

(5:28:10) up and we will continue to have that fight as we climb to 300,000 subscribers

(5:28:17) next and then climb to a million subscribers after that. So, that's the goal. But anyway, I appreciate it uh

(5:28:24) Sarah the Tomato always uh for having us on. Uh oh. Did we lock up?

(5:28:31) Did we freeze up? Does that mean we're about to get kicked? What does that mean? She like

(5:28:38) totally froze the [ __ ] up. What the [ __ ]

(5:28:44) Oh well, whatever.
