(0:14) having me I appreciate it So I got I'm not sure about this jarred water though I don't like Jarred Water Well we like
(0:21) to be like environmentally friendly I care I care a lot about the
(0:26) environment Please disregard this can I mean it's such like a beautiful studio and this and that I'm like why am I
(0:33) drinking out of a mason jar what's going on here well I feel like that's higher quality Yeah higher quality HDML That's
(0:38) fair All right Um so how how did you get
(0:44) into this space of YouTube uh by complete accident Really yeah So were
(0:49) you just like a normal guy working like Yep normal guy I was working um mostly
(0:54) doing well I mean um I I did robotics repair and uh industrial robotics
(1:01) maintenance and um yeah essentially um when COVID happened they shut down the
(1:08) types of plants that I was working at Mh So I had some free time and I started going on and wrecking people in various
(1:16) um I won't say where but um a pretty pretty public uh internet area I started
(1:22) wrecking them pretty bad and um people enjoyed it and I enjoyed it So I kept going back and wrecking more of them
(1:29) because I hate the left Like made me really hate them Yeah And um you know
(1:34) that hasn't changed either I still really hate them but um but that's how I got into it So because I've always
(1:41) wondered you're so normal and the people in this industry are so weird Yeah You
(1:46) You and Rachel both are just like the most normal people and so grounded and I find that people that didn't have real
(1:53) jobs before just go kind of nuts because they never have to deal with like being told no ever Yeah Yeah Well there's a
(2:02) same thing I've noticed the same exact thing So one of the things is um like I
(2:07) didn't know I'd be a great entertainer that I had no idea that but it happened right and I think when it happens to
(2:15) people like me you know I was already in my late 30s you know I'd already been raising a family I'd been in the private
(2:20) sector my entire life uh you know working 40 60 70 80our weeks depending
(2:27) um so yeah very normal people and yes this industry is completely filled to
(2:32) the brim with absolute absolute [ __ ] lunatics all over the place So uh yeah I get I get what she's saying So what were
(2:38) you like before like if a like if a woman said something stupid at your job would you say it i would dunk on her
(2:45) Yeah And you wouldn't get in trouble because like I mean cuz people Well first of all it's a very male oriented
(2:53) industry that I'm in right but I just got to tell like men in trades are all like me People think they're on the
(3:00) internet and they're like "Real men do." I'm like look every electrician every uh you know every guy
(3:08) who's doing HVAC every guy who's underneath uh you know a Chrysler with a
(3:13) wrench in his hand today they're all like that They don't put up with Shut up
(3:18) You know what I mean they don't put up with any of it So well you know there's some some Sims don't get me wrong but
(3:23) I'm just saying like um most of the time no they just they just don't put up with it because I had a hard time in
(3:30) volleyball because like I couldn't really be super vocal with my opinions and when I was it's like it was all
(3:37) women though Oh my god Yeah I you know I played in a tournament with trans people once Gross And this is why I don't feel
(3:44) bad at all for women that play with trans people because I was the one who said something And do you know who
(3:50) yelled at me who [ __ ] women Of course Of course It's like so now I don't feel
(3:57) bad at all Get punched in the face I don't care Yeah I don't care I don't care Get Well like it's the only way for
(4:03) them to learn Yeah You know it's the only way for them to learn They're like "We didn't want this." I'm like "Yes you
(4:08) did Yes you did There was a little bit of social pressure you gave to it immediately So now they steal all your
(4:14) little medals they beat you in all your little events you know what I mean and we just get to kick back and let because
(4:19) like when's the opposite ever going to happen it's never going to be a female to male who's going to go out there and clear the football team You know what I
(4:25) mean that's never we don't have to worry about it It's not even a big deal for us We're like "Yeah bring them in We'd love
(4:30) to beat up on them right?" But women they you know they they're the ones who got to worry about it And it's like
(4:36) "Well if you voted in you voted in." I know For every one Riley gains there's like 10 women fighting to be beat up by
(4:43) dudes I don't feel bad I don't feel bad at all True I live by the sword die by
(4:49) the sword I do not care Yep Live by the vote die by the vote That's right So you're like one of the most based
(4:56) conservatives I would say Like you're one of the only ones that call out like conservative feminism Did you notice
(5:02) that from the time you were like young or is that something you kind of woke up to in the last few years i've seen it
(5:08) I've seen it from day one in this industry I mean even my early very early debates with women who were supposed
(5:15) conservatives It was it was like that where we were going back and forth and be like "You sound a lot more like a
(5:21) feminist than you do uh you know a right-wing Christian conservative or even a right-winger at all." So I mean
(5:28) all the way back in the early days of the Crucible we were basically doing battle with the evil women of the
(5:33) internet and there's many of them And where like where were you at in the
(5:38) beginning like what forums like Yeah I'm not I don't even want to dive into it Oh
(5:43) really yeah Oh okay Yep Don't even want to dive into it But you used to debate with like Destiny Yeah Yeah Destiny all
(5:50) those guys The reason I don't There's nothing nefarious there Like people can go find it all but
(5:55) Um it's because I used to work with another group right and I just don't want to give them any clout because it
(6:01) pisses them off right that's really it I just don't want to give them any clout
(6:06) because this is you before I'm like "Oh is that a bad topic i didn't mean dumb." Yeah Yeah I just like I I'm sure it
(6:12) irritates them and so I just find Why do they turn on you or something yeah I'm not going to get into it Oh okay So
(6:19) there was there was some whatever Yeah there was some bad blood there But you were killing Destiny even in the early
(6:24) days Oh yeah Yeah Going way way back We've always been I mean I've I don't know how many debates I've had with that
(6:30) guy Many you know what I mean and he is one of my favorite ones to tangle with on the left because he's not a complete
(6:35) you know [ __ ] idiot Um but yeah we've I mean and we'll we'll tangle up I'm
(6:41) sure in the future too So do you think that he's woken up at all like post the
(6:47) divorce post like getting a sexual out nothing Live by the source He's
(6:54) completely He's completely unfazed by any of it Uh but you have to understand like look at it from his perspective He
(7:00) doesn't have shame No like those guys If people are going to pork your chick and you're okay with it like how are you
(7:06) going to shame them shame them with what i know but you're like can imagine like you go over to your friend's house and
(7:12) he's like "Hey come on in man Have a coke." And you sit down You're like "How's it going?" And you just like you're hearing sex noises from the other room Like "What's going on?" Oh you know
(7:19) Fred he's over here [ __ ] my wife You know he's just over here [ __ ] my wife No big deal Don't worry about it You
(7:24) know what I mean so anyway what do you want to do tonight it's like so if you don't feel shame by that you like you're
(7:30) not going to shame a person like that They don't care Well I almost think they're kind of pragmatic because I
(7:38) talked to someone I know who's like he does the open relationships and stuff and the way he sees it is the
(7:44) conservative guys are getting cheated on anyways So he's like I might as well get to do it too Like like think about it
(7:51) like this If a conservative guy gets cheated on um but he's loyal who's more
(7:57) of a cuck Kim or Destiny who's banged like half of conservative commentators well he's not a cuck unless he knows
(8:03) like cuckoldry would require the like the requisite So I mean that comes from the cuckoo bird and the idea is that the
(8:11) the kid is unknowingly you're unknowingly raising the child because you don't know That would be where the
(8:17) cuckoldry comes in Same thing would be you knew that your chick was banging somebody else Otherwise if you're just
(8:24) getting cheated on like that's just [ __ ] up Like you didn't What did you do no I I'm not say like I wouldn't I
(8:29) like I wouldn't want to do that type of thing right obviously but like the way they view it is some of them that I've
(8:36) spoken to in depth is like they're [ __ ] anyway Like the like the way they're going to view it is you guys are
(8:42) doing the same thing You just don't know it Like your women are cheating anyway At least this way I get a ro like I mean
(8:48) his roster is kind of impressive It's like Lauren Southern he banged Pixie's okay really like is is that is that
(8:56) impressive i mean these a lot a lot of these types of women have like spent their whole life with a mattress
(9:02) strapped to their back right i just think most guys would find them like attractive I'm not I'm not saying like
(9:07) it's good whatever but but hang on I'm saying like the guy who's getting cheated on Here's what I've noticed
(9:12) though from doing so many especially live whatevers I've noticed this trend
(9:17) Uh so you I'll ask women like who's who's the more attractive sex men or women and they're always like women right and even the men say women right
(9:24) and so I I started thinking about it though and I was like wait a second So I started reframing the question I'd be like now let's say you couldn't get a
(9:31) boob job You couldn't wear any sort of makeup You couldn't get any sort of cosmetic surgery done You couldn't have
(9:37) any butt lifts You couldn't have any facelifts You couldn't have any of that And it's just you all women versus all
(9:43) men Who's the most attractive men and their answers are like night and day So I'm like so
(9:48) basically if men just went "Okay we're just going to get a ton of cosmetic surgery then and wear makeup all day we
(9:56) would actually probably be the more attractive sex." Probably Yeah Because I mean you see it a little bit in
(10:01) Hollywood The men get Botox veneers they get hair transplant and it does transform the way they look I mean
(10:08) there's a reason women do it as much as we make fun of it Like I mean I've seen women because it works They're always
(10:13) trying to capture youth Yeah And so you know they do they but basically I'm like so basically you're all augmented And
(10:20) you're like that makes us the the you know the better looking sex And I'm like what about without all those augmentations what do you look like then
(10:27) it's like ah it's not it's not great You know what they look like they look like those chicks and those old women's
(10:33) voting uh or or the uh the alcohol prohibition posters where they're like lips like yours will not touch my you
(10:40) know lips who drink a beer won't touch mine And you look at those women you're like why would anybody's lips want to touch you would have to be drunk Like
(10:46) you'd have to be drunk to want to touch those women But that's more akin to what they would actually look like So yeah I
(10:53) don't even believe the fairer sex thing I don't even think so Like basically every single lie all we've been told
(10:59) about women has over the years just crumbled completely Until like 25 I would say women are more attractive I
(11:06) don't think so No I think if it was the same augmentation you know what I mean same augmentation available to both I
(11:11) mean these women are getting boob jobs at 22 Do you know what we forgot about steroids for men That really changes
(11:17) guys like physique when they go on like Yeah I mean yeah they like punch walls
(11:22) but Yeah And women cry when they're on their like you know oh I'm dieting I'm
(11:27) on my special diet And they you know they go [ __ ] ballistic crazy too I don't know why they never for we never
(11:32) for remember that Like go guys are roided up get roid ra Like that's true Have you ever seen what it's like when a
(11:38) woman's dieting what her attitude's like when she's dieting they're like conniving horrible [ __ ] So you guys
(11:45) really solve all our problems They're like "You can't diet anymore Here's Ozic You're flat Here's some fake boobs
(11:52) Here's some fake boobs You don't want to age here's some bones Oh you're having self-esteem issues What can we [ __ ]
(11:57) do for you today?" Yeah exactly And then the men the men are like "Well we What about prostate cancer we're like dying."
(12:03) They're like "Fuck you But here's a boner pill for those augmented women
(12:10) Yeah you that we get old and our husbands don't want to screw us anymore They're like "Here's Viagra It's his fault." Yeah Just sit there Just sit
(12:17) there and hope So but I mean all of it it all starts to collapse actually very
(12:22) quickly Like even even in studio when you see these women with your eyes your camera eyes versus how they are when how
(12:30) they how they appear I'm I'm always telling guys I'm like "Listen they don't look like what you think they look
(12:36) like." You know what I mean even the outfits are designed specifically to like pinch here cinch there take a
(12:42) little bit off of there makes me look a little thinner here Like all of it it's all conniving The corsets Yeah It's all
(12:48) conniving and it's all BS You know what I mean and it's like um so yeah just like basically all illusions that I
(12:55) might have ever had are completely gone Did you see my catfish of the year no
(13:00) like the threat Oh yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah I think I made it I forgot
(13:05) There's some major publication that I was in and I was like on um it went so
(13:12) viral they got so mad All cuz I said that you don't look like your pictures
(13:17) Didn't call them ugly I didn't say you were badl looking right i didn't even
(13:22) say I was better looking I just said you don't look like your pictures And some of those were so You know who won who
(13:29) that like crazy red-headed lady The libertarian The redheaded libertarian Oh yeah Yeah I saw the comparison contrast
(13:37) too And it's like you spend a little bit of work Yeah You spend a little time
(13:43) before you go into work working on what you look like before you go to work or Yeah If if your beauty is a full-time
(13:50) job you might just not look like that Yeah Yeah Agreed What's your favorite
(13:55) moment of your career like is there a debate that because you recently my favorite for I think well my favorite
(14:02) for me like just the one that I enjoyed the most who did was with Bivo with who bivo
(14:08) Who's that bivo the cuck He was oh man that was the funniest [ __ ] ever This guy
(14:14) this Only Fans chick was there with her boyfriend Bivo who's like a famous Tik Tocker or was a famous Tik Tocker and
(14:22) his whole claim to fame is that he swallowed food whole Okay And he came in and he was like "Yeah this is my only
(14:27) fans girl." He's like "You let your chick get stuffed by other dudes and you're just like you know okay with that?" He's like "Yeah what's wrong with
(14:33) that?" "No you ain't going to care when I live in my mansion and this." And then he just started spuring out and it was
(14:38) really funny right i didn't think anything of it But the next day he came out with this cope video where he was
(14:45) like "Okay so the whole thing was a LAR and I'm not really a cuck guys I don't you know blah blah blah blah blah." And
(14:51) that was all [ __ ] Turns out he really was and he was just coping you know what I mean he's like "My dad
(14:56) called me and said "Hey you can't be letting your chick you know bang other guys right?"
(15:03) Well and if you're going to Okay if you're going to be a cuck like own it At least Destiny owns it right i mean like
(15:11) he's not going to do an apology video Yeah There's no shame at all They don't care No shame you know and feminism
(15:18) works out really well for leftists honestly I mean leftist men love it better than anybody sexual liberation
(15:23) from they wouldn't get laid without it Like imagine there was the enforcability of what we had in the early 1900s where
(15:30) women were just socially compelled to remain chased until they were until they were married right leftist men have you
(15:37) ever seen what they look like they don't get no [ __ ] chicks They ain't getting any They're not getting So sexual
(15:43) liberation is like they love it because it's the one way where they can be the mistake right you you you they could be
(15:50) that woman's next mistake you know and they're leverage themselves to do it So yeah Which Oh my gosh And you called him
(15:57) out for the Lauren Southern stuff before that long before it ever came out I knew that that was they were like they were
(16:03) like that didn't happen It didn't happen No And then like his friend comes out 40inute video That happened Yeah Yeah
(16:12) So funny It was so funny How was um debating Tommy Lauren uh well she's
(16:17) insufferable and she's also she you very deep voice on uh Tommy Lauren right very
(16:25) masculine traits on her but also like many of these conservative commentators I really don't understand the female
(16:32) conservative commentator sphere because they're really really [ __ ] stupid And
(16:37) I'm like how is it that you keep getting brought on TV and then then you realize oh I see it's because they think that
(16:44) men want to have sex with you and so they present you as you know a package where you say right-wing thing plus men
(16:50) want [ __ ] and then bam we make money So once you realize that that's what the formula is it's like okay that makes
(16:57) more sense because they are really stupid And it's like it's no wonder you don't see female conservatives in the
(17:04) debates sphere with feminists because they would just get destroyed They would ju the feminists would just mangle them
(17:10) because they're so [ __ ] stupid I mean just ridiculously stupid Yeah I think
(17:16) there was a point in that debate where you said I can't remember what you said I
(17:21) just remember her face and it was just asked what duties women have Oh that was it It was so I was like what are duties
(17:28) that women have towards men and she was like "Well I just think that men naturally want to provide for women."
(17:34) I'm like "So wait so you think that I want to get you nice [ __ ] just to watch you have it?" You know like that's
(17:42) that's what you're saying Great Well that's fantastic Every man on earth wants to sign up for that And then if
(17:48) you say that to him like well you're not a real man right you know a real man will buy me nice [ __ ] and then just
(17:53) watch how happy I am when I get it That's what real men do These they're wild These these women are wild and out
(18:00) especially especially on the conservative side You know th in fact a
(18:06) lot of the feminists the outright outspoken feminists act more conservative in their relationships with
(18:12) men than the conservative women do Yeah Significantly more submissive than the
(18:18) conservative counterparts which is just insane to me I know I saw you on
(18:24) whatever and you're one of the few people that say that there's no difference between conservative and
(18:29) liberal women Like you hear Charlie Kirk and he'll say like you know a woman's
(18:34) political opinions matter And I don't know what you found on whatever but when I was doing interviews I didn't really
(18:41) see a difference I was like you can just reprogram her after you Yeah Well I mean
(18:46) there's always going to be individuals who have good political takes who are women Mhm Like that's the case But you
(18:53) generally speaking it's like a general statement It is true that the you can't put a piece of paper between
(19:01) conservative female commentators and and feminist female commentators Like it's a
(19:06) piece of paper between them And um and that's what I found too And when I'm
(19:11) debating them they always use the same talking points And instantly you know what's really fun to watch if you get
(19:17) two conservative females on a panel and there's like four liberal females and you start tangling up with with both
(19:24) sides and you watch the sisterhood form instantly right suddenly they're not
(19:29) conservatives or women or or or uh liberals right they're they're women and you're an evil oppressive patriarchal
(19:36) lunatic man right instantly all of the political divide gone I saw that with
(19:42) Nala That was crazy All of the Oh my gosh Michael Null Have you debated him
(19:48) yet he won't debate Oh I've asked multiple times requested it multiple times live and I know that Brian
(19:54) whatever has requested it multiple times The guy won't debate Yeah You know it's really funny for the guy who always gets
(20:01) a lot of [ __ ] They're like "You only debate 304s." I'm like if the roster of men that I've debated is massive right
(20:08) the roster of men most of my critics has debated zero Zero So it's like uh I'm
(20:14) just an equal about it right i don't care if you're a [ __ ] idiot who's a guy or a girl right both of you You're
(20:20) an equal opportunity Equal opportunist when it comes to that So with Nolles though yeah I would be happy to him all
(20:26) of those guys on the Daily Wire I was always happy to tango especially Claven after I saw the Claven interview you did
(20:32) I was like "Oh man I want to tear into Claven so bad on this because they're they're just clueless They have no idea
(20:37) what they're talking about." Yeah What are your biggest disagreements with them like what would you if I were to take
(20:42) like the the Daily Wire and T USA and all that if you were gonna if you were gonna do you versus like 10 of them what
(20:50) would be like the points you brought up well the first thing I would do is I would say like you guys publicly lie a
(20:55) lot about the idea of women in your organizations because when I talk to the TPUSA people on the ground privately who
(21:03) are at universities organizers things like that they're like "Andrew I totally agree with everything you're saying These women are completely predatory
(21:10) They're a big problem to have in our organization You know what I mean i wish more people would tangle up with them
(21:15) They know it's an issue They just pretend it's not And why it's because they want a ground swell of support from
(21:21) conservative women That's what they're after right uh the problem is they're not actually speaking to real
(21:28) conservative women's issues And real conservative women's issues are not it's not about these stupid idea of baking
(21:35) bread wearing a [ __ ] sundress And that's what it's become Mhm So you know the first thing I would dive into is
(21:41) like well what are the women's issues between the left and the right right
(21:47) that you find makes the woman a right-winger or a left-winger what are these actual issues where's the divide
(21:54) here i don't think they give me an answer I don't think they could actually give me an answer I think that they would end up saying a bunch of social
(22:00) issues that were all leftwing based all of them And conservatives are even trying to
(22:06) fund IVF now Yeah Yeah It's so crazy I'll see Candace Owens tweeting about
(22:12) how like the Gardil shot is making women infertile Yeah I saw that And I'm like I don't know I think it might just be
(22:18) women having kids older and also getting too many STDs also makes you Yeah it's
(22:24) not hard But the thing is like when one out of three women has an had an STD like and we all know we all know it's
(22:31) higher right if we're admitting to one out of three it's half Yeah But but Pearl here's a bit of one Why would
(22:37) conservative men advocate that women go to college knowing that it's like the
(22:43) most degenerate institute they could ever send women it's the stupidest thing I've ever heard What goes on at college
(22:50) a bunch of conservative stuff or a bunch of having sex drinking drugs promiscuity
(22:56) that's what That's what goes on at That's what college is famous for It's not famous for rolling out highly
(23:01) educated women That's for sure It's definitely famous for rolling out progressive women who had very highly
(23:08) promiscuous histories in college It's like why would conservatives be advocating for that no we would need an
(23:14) educated populace Send all of our all of our reproducing age women to a a den of
(23:21) literal degeneracy That's the stupidest [ __ ] I've ever heard And I've never heard any of them get put to that
(23:26) question ever once Like why do you think that's a good idea they they have no idea They have no like why are you
(23:33) advocating for that it's dumb It's just like when Lauren Chen was she was advocating for Oh that was advocating
(23:40) for secular marriage I'm like why advocating for what secular marriage I'm like why would you advocate for secular
(23:46) marriage what's the point of that she was like actually now that I think about it I don't really know what the point of
(23:51) that is She disappeared Thank you for the super chat It says keep up the good work Thank you guys
(24:00) Um that was a hilarious debate She was like spuring out Yeah Jen Yeah
(24:08) Enemies take down themselves Yeah There was a You know what's really
(24:13) funny what I noticed is that all those people who went after Crowder on the divorce thing crickets they all took
(24:20) themselves out Like within a year of that they all started just one by one taking themselves out all the ones who
(24:26) so I'm like kind of waiting for the Candace fall too because she went pretty hard That was when I was like people in
(24:32) my chat ask me all the time like do you support Candace Owen nope Said why and I was like when this guy
(24:39) was getting divorced we all knew he was under gag order Couldn't say [ __ ] He couldn't say
(24:45) anything to anybody right and that's when they hit him when he when he couldn't defend himself Like the worst
(24:50) cowardly weasly way to attack And she was right there and still is She doubles down on it right she double doubles down
(24:58) Oh he's an abuser Shut up Shut up He's an abuser He like And oh he talked to
(25:04) his wife in a bad way [ __ ] Are you going to tell your husband how he's allowed to talk to you shut the [ __ ] up
(25:10) Well and you don't know what the con what critical context is behind that like what if she had been a [ __ ] for 36
(25:17) hours before and he finally lost his mind for 5 seconds but that's what's filmed Like you don't even these people
(25:22) didn't even have the context They were looking to bump him off and kind of jockey themselves into a little position
(25:28) there is what they were looking for Says "Welcome what does that say welcome to the Crucible Crew." Yeah welcome to the
(25:34) Crucible Crew Happy to see you guys there No Well that's the thing with her
(25:40) I really used to be a fan of her but I'm like she's the same Like the Crowder thing was so
(25:47) disappointing for me because I watched all of like because I feel like I came at this from a viewer and I just watched
(25:53) all the conservatives that I I thought I really liked just pile on top of this guy who like what did he do he raised
(26:00) his voice at his wife That was it really Like none of you have raised your voices
(26:05) in your own home ever Re all of your fights you look like an angel Really and
(26:11) I'm like if you were really like now she's grifting Catholicism and I'm like if you really meant the Catholicism
(26:16) stuff like you would have a retraction an apology and you wouldn't be telling a guy how to run his house It's also fine
(26:23) to change That's bigger now The grift lord is here The grift is here You must send super chat for the grift So yeah
(26:30) send it Um the other thing is is like you know what what about this you could
(26:35) also just be like you know what i was wrong I was wrong and called it wrong And you know what Stephen sorry about
(26:41) that He just do that too He's so nice Like the guy would probably be like you know what no problem You know but they
(26:48) don't even do that They now now a lot of that stuff is public right and they still won't do it And it's like well you
(26:56) know Candace all all goodwill I might have had towards her the second that happened right Gone I mean she said he
(27:03) was an abusive monster I'm like really said worse than that you know and who
(27:08) knows what what a chick like that with connection who knows what she did behind the scenes right who knows what they do behind the scenes you know conniving
(27:16) evil backstabbing lunatics So yeah screw that Yeah So what would be your next
(27:22) point with them so the first part would be about college and Yeah Well I would I will No the first point would be to ask
(27:29) what the distinctions what they would consider the actual distinctions between the behaviors of conservative and
(27:35) liberal progressive women What are they i don't think they could give me many The second would be to ask why they send
(27:40) them to these dens of inequity when they know that that's a terrible idea And the third is why it is that they refuse to
(27:48) engage in any of the points of the red pill in order to either a refute them
(27:54) right or b adopt them But give a Christian prescription correct for what it is or you know see just like blow
(28:01) them all out right you have you have to either offer the reputation at some point Uh or you're going to get
(28:08) dominated by the ideology These are supposed to be Christian conservative commentators The only one I've ever seen
(28:14) in the red pill doing battle with these guys is [ __ ] me I've never seen anybody else doing it Mhm And the thing
(28:19) that's so funny is even though I fight with red pill guys constantly I'm constantly debating with them I get
(28:25) associated with red pill because I won't take any [ __ ] from these feminist women That was going to be my next question If
(28:31) you consider yourself redpilled at all I think that descriptors from red pillars
(28:37) are often fine Like descriptions of what's going on is fine I think that most of the time they come out with
(28:44) prescriptors they're terrible and stupid and kind of [ __ ] Mhm So like when guys are saying you know sleep with
(28:50) multitudes of women to like experience a level up I think that that's dumb I think if they're saying things like u do
(28:56) you think it works though no No it doesn't work You don't think women treat men who has access to that like this
(29:04) teeny tiny percentage of men How's that going to help uh men in general well I'm not talking about men in general I'm
(29:10) talking about like individual men Like if they're if they're trying it and coming back and saying that this helped
(29:17) them in their life like you can't really argue with that Yeah But I mean you could say the same thing with heroin You
(29:22) could say the same thing with crack cocaine whatever you wanted You know I tried cocaine It helped me in this portion of my life It's like I still
(29:28) wouldn't give it as a prescription for people to do you know like when I was really down and out here's an easy one
(29:34) When I was really down and out after a breakup I would drink way too much That doesn't mean I would give that out as a
(29:40) prescription that men drink way too much after a breakup Yeah But I don't really see it as like they're telling men what
(29:46) to do I just think it's more like if you want to do this this is how to do it Yeah I agree But that would again be a
(29:52) descriptor instead of a prescript It's the guys who give it as a prescription or the pickup dating dating artist
(29:58) community does this a lot Yeah Like live how I live Yeah Here's the various prescriptions or what society should be
(30:04) doing or things like this That's where they run a foul a lot And you got to take some some of the descriptors with a
(30:10) grain of salt too They're not always true The pair bonding studies aren't always true There's lots of stuff you got to be careful about I just think
(30:15) like anecdotally though um I think most men like women just tend
(30:24) to abuse men when they know that they're their only source of sex And that's where the problem comes in Well what do
(30:31) you mean like women just have a tendency to not um
(30:36) like I don't know I I see so many men where they're married and the wife knows that he doesn't cheat and she just does
(30:43) not appreciate his loyalty And I see women where they think that the husband either could cheat or would cheat and
(30:50) they just tend to treat him better Yeah Tend to behave better Yeah And I think that's like that's what I was saying where as much as you don't like it I can
(30:58) see why Yeah But can there be that luminous implicit threat without it ever even being stated like I think there can
(31:05) be And I think that those guys a lot of those guys who can do that they don't even bother saying what what do they need to say it for mhm They It's well
(31:12) known that they can just do it You can't tell her Yeah You don't need to tell her right it's not It's not important So how
(31:19) is that But how's that a prescription there's such a small select few guys who can do that who have Do you know what I
(31:27) think it's more common than you'd think I I met this guy the other day He was like 57 overweight He was showing me his
(31:34) rotation He was like 5 22 23 year old women Was he rich no He was just good
(31:40) talker He like he was just um easy to talk to So I don't know if it's like
(31:46) from what I've seen the PUAs I don't think they're always the most attractive like or rich guys Like sometimes they're
(31:52) just charming They're also con artists A lot of them they're conning right like they make that [ __ ] up Like that guy
(31:59) that guy John Anthony lifestyle total [ __ ] con artist Just made it all up you know oh I forgot I've got an 8,000
(32:04) body He's like "Shut up dude." And then the guy tells me he's like "I've never met a pickup artist in the world who
(32:10) hasn't done a [ __ ] one or two." And I'm like that is disgusting I'm like "What dude what?" He's like "Yeah I've
(32:15) never met one who hasn't." And I'm like "Yeah I'm pretty sure most of them don't." So the thing is is like uh a lot
(32:21) of those guys are full of [ __ ] about their mark I've I've gone to events like I've seen them take the women home and a
(32:27) lot of times it's really not um it's not always the best looking guys They're just charming Like I don't I've remained
(32:35) skeptical in this regard that I mean it's fine Like one of the PUAs I met in like Vegas I mean he was not attractive
(32:41) at all Mhm I mean some some are right like a lot of like a good amount are but
(32:46) there's enough that aren't goodlook that like you would I'm surprised you would
(32:52) like you would be surprised just from what I've seen Yeah I mean I'm sure that there's again there's going to be men
(32:58) who are you know are exceptions to these rules You know what I mean but I don't think for the most part um it's
(33:05) available to most men to be just be able to go sleep with whatever type of woman they want I know It's just the challenge
(33:10) is there's just no incentive for men to be loyal today Like what do they get out of it well uh family the family we're
(33:19) having like one kid each That's that's true Women aren't really having kids That's true But but again and like
(33:25) there's no incentive like the wives cheat all the time Yeah But there's also
(33:30) wives that don't cheat at all So the key the key is this It's a matter of what you can't verify that You don't know You
(33:36) don't think every single wife cheats do you i don't think every single wife cheats but like my point is if she does
(33:43) there's a lot of avenues where he wouldn't even know There's a lot of avenues the other way too I agree Right
(33:49) But I guess the point is is yes it is it is true if we average all of the children Mhm Yes It averages out to you
(33:57) know less than two per woman That's true But that doesn't mean women are only having one kid you It just means that
(34:04) fewer women are having multiple kids and other women are having zero kids So it's like yeah there's still men who I want
(34:11) to see them have a family have multiple children and have a loyal wife And yeah I still think that's very possible It's
(34:18) like possible but I don't I don't know I just talking to young guys I don't think I think a lot of them don't really see
(34:24) that as happening for them Well I think a lot of times they're like every trend is predicting it's not going to get
(34:31) better it's going to get worse That's true And I agree that it'll get worse Like Yeah And so it's like they could
(34:36) hope for that but that's not a strategy you know Well it is a strategy though when you start looking for what virtues
(34:42) are Once men re reallocate their idea of feminine virtue or female virtue what
(34:49) I've noticed is you know I get contacted by thousands of men all over the world Like once I reoriented for what I
(34:55) considered feminine virtues to be I started being very much more successful towards women who had held those virtues
(35:01) Yeah But it's for now right i mean you don't know how it's going to play out in 10 years and 20 Like a lot of a lot of
(35:06) women are virtuous for a period of time You know there's just no It's tough I
(35:12) think interviewing the men that were divorced kind of blackpilled me because
(35:18) um I would just see women that in every like on paper were better than me in
(35:23) every way They married younger they were like more religious you know and I'm like like you know they married at 20 or
(35:30) whatever um orthodox Catholic whatever whatever it is right and they did like
(35:37) terrible terrible things like awful things And I'm like "Wow there's no
(35:42) there's also heavy societal influence telling them that it's perfectly acceptable for them to do those things."
(35:48) We had a society not very long ago we can look to where the incentives were the opposite Where if you did those
(35:53) things there was uh very much social punishments which would come with them You know single motherhood was
(35:59) considered you were considered a pariah right you know things like that That's that's no joke Social enforcement works
(36:06) If you think that we could not propagandize from the top down again for social enforcement like we used to I
(36:11) very much disagree Every single war every single thing that people believe right now all comes from top down
(36:16) propaganda And it's like you could do the same thing when it came to the dynamics of family and relationship But
(36:23) women would have to do social enforcement towards paras like they used to Yeah I don't think it would work
(36:28) Don't think so no You know there's countries that it it does work and is working How is it working eastern block
(36:34) nations they've been promoting not only birth rates through tax incentives but also the family unit from the top down
(36:41) Younger men are reporting much happier levels when it comes to the marriages they're having with younger women and
(36:46) women are acting a more virtuous way Way less single moms There's a lot of good stuff coming out of that Yeah And maybe
(36:53) like you could argue that but just I don't think that the women on whatever
(36:59) are really going to change what they're doing right well not all the women first of all Like I don't you know not all the
(37:04) women on whatever are bad right it but there is I agree yeah like there's a case selection of many who are right but
(37:12) a lot of them there there's actually a good amount of women who've gone through whatever who are kind of based and kind
(37:18) of with it and understand that there's serious and significant problems going on you know what I mean uh but there's
(37:23) just also the ones who you don't want to touch with a 10-ft pull and who are [ __ ] delusional and everything else
(37:29) and they come from all walks of life I don't think that it's unfixable like you have a more blackpilled kind of idea
(37:35) than I do where you're just like this is unfixable Let it all burn to the ground I don't think so though Well I just
(37:41) don't think we have as much as an impact as you might think Like I don't think commentators can change trends I agree
(37:48) Yeah So like no hang on Let me out that some can but we ain't going
(37:55) to like some can Well at at like the highest echelons yeah I think some
(38:01) commentators are able to kind of shift like I've seen memes change paradigms
(38:06) I've seen a single meme change the way people view a problem So I mean I know that that does work Um but when you're
(38:14) when you're talking about changing the entire social trend of a country which has been indoctrinated with femin
(38:20) feminism and communism for a hundred years and has been indoctrinated with ideology which is around women's
(38:26) liberation We're all born and bred and raised in it Yeah that's going to take a while That's not a fast fast process But
(38:32) here's here's my question to you though Like if we're under replacement rate aren't they all going to die out anyway
(38:38) yeah but there's no guarantee Like I've seen very Christian parents give birth to liberal kids Yeah it happens But it's
(38:44) but it's less likely Uh when it comes to the women I don't really see a difference Um I like I understand if you
(38:51) look at the body count between between kids who are raised in a Christian household and kids who are not it is not
(38:57) even It's not who has more incentive to lie Yeah But who is who has more incentive
(39:03) to lie like you know I I don't really trust any I don't trust any study that
(39:08) says like women said they do this Yeah Like come on But in this but in the social paradigm they both have the
(39:14) incentive to lie No because liberal women are still judged for being [ __ ] even if they're liberals right but
(39:20) they're much more open They'll do it on camera right so will conservative women I mean they'll do it on camera too So
(39:28) they'll just switch Yeah They like they do it on camera too I I think they're both in would have the same incentive
(39:33) there because uh the idea of you being the social pariah because you have a high body count affects them both But
(39:38) conservative women find the workarounds So they do it from the back door They'll blow and they won't count it as a body
(39:45) Yeah Progressives do progressive women do the same [ __ ] I've questioned both ends of that ideology both on both sides
(39:51) Like progressive women also do not want to give you their body count Progressive women also do not want you to know you
(39:58) know XYZ same as the conservatives that social pariah aspect still very much there And here's why Those progressive
(40:05) women they still want conservative guys They want Chad conservative guys I would just from my experience balance of
(40:12) probabilities the conservative women lie more because there's more incentive to I
(40:18) would say they're more I would say they're more dishonest where the liberal women will say "Yep I'm a [ __ ] [ __ ]
(40:24) march." and the conservative women put on a dress and say they're not but they you know blow half of conservative media
(40:31) I mean that happens I just think that they both have an incentive to not tell the truth about the body count But I
(40:37) just I don't And by the way you can adjust for that in studies too You can actually make adjustments for that by
(40:42) asking uh questions in different ways And then if you have different sorts of answers you can make comparisons on that
(40:48) and go "Well wait so one still has to be more truthful than the other." Yeah I just wouldn't take any study on body
(40:54) count seriously Why not like if anything because women lie about it So why do
(40:59) like why am I going to take their word for anything yeah But I mean like what I
(41:05) would prefer is age of first marriage number of kids I think is better Christians have that better too Yeah A
(41:11) little bit But Gen Z it's really not that different Like if you include boomer women in Gen X Yeah But if you
(41:18) Gen Z not really Yeah What comes after Gen Z is Gen Alpha and that might be the most based the most based ever
(41:26) generation that has ever lived We don't know yet Yeah I mean it could be I mean
(41:32) they were saying Gen X were going to be the worst degenerates ever and they're actually less degenerate than than Gen Z
(41:37) Gen X Okay And they weren't the worst degenerates ever They became much more socially conservative than people
(41:43) thought Gen Z on the other hand and and millennials especially Millennials became a bunch of leftist scumbags So
(41:48) Gen Z moving the paradigm back a little bit It's very possible that generation alpha is finally the first generation of
(41:55) actual alphas right rocking around It's possible I mean I just see the sexes going further and further apart Good And
(42:02) I I see um that's a good thing I want that I want the division I thought you wanted the families the I do want the
(42:08) families but the idea of the sexes being far apart is saying that we both have gender roles and those gender rules I'm
(42:15) not going to settle for less than that gender role and neither are you And it's like so one's going to have to break and
(42:21) it's going to be women first because they need men Men don't need them Yeah But I what I see is it becoming more
(42:26) monetized and you're already seeing that with I mean with all the Only Fans models that you've debated right like
(42:32) it's just going to become more transactional Like that's what I would predict for the future I don't wi I'm not saying I wish that right but if I
(42:39) had to like guess what's going to happen in like do you really think in 10 years it's going to be any more conservative
(42:46) Yeah Yes I do I don't think so Yeah I mean I wouldn't have expected Trump to have gotten elected the second time
(42:51) either right not not on the heels of all the propaganda which had happened against him But you know the truth is is
(42:58) like the pendulum when it swings back right is swinging much harder back right So it used to be a little bit more like
(43:05) kind of even It would go to the left then it would come back to the right then it would go back to the left It would be about even Now it's ticking
(43:10) left and then it swings harder Then it goes back to the left and then it swings harder to the right So it's always
(43:16) swinging harder right Uh if we look at states states are beginning the process of outlawing pornography right they're
(43:22) beginning the process of doing that Many of them successfully have done it Uh and I think that that trend is going to be
(43:28) moving more and more and more towards that until you get to a place it's like eventually Yeah but they won't ban
(43:35) they'll ban like porn but they won't ban only fans No some of them are moving towards banning others I doubt it Come
(43:40) on Women are going to die on the hill of like Yeah but you Okay but I will
(43:47) challenge this by saying this A few years ago we had this conversation on abortion and you're like man that's
(43:52) never going to happen and women will never allow the you know for abortion to go well well Row versus Wade was
(43:59) overturned but plan B like don't you consider plan B abortion yeah The thing is and that's way up Like if you look if
(44:06) you you could say maybe abortions have gone down a little bit but plan B's have gone up quite a bit but it was still the
(44:12) first step in the mitigation process So it just starts So all of this polit politics you really think slowing you
(44:20) think number of kids is going to go up like you think marriage is really going to go down not not anytime soon Not
(44:27) anytime soon But here's the thing The the trend is population is going to go still increase a little bit Then it's
(44:32) going to plateau and then the nose dive that we have in the years of pain that'll come from having an elderly
(44:38) population that doesn't have enough young people to care for them is going to be very brutal But I do think that
(44:43) necessarily just like we've seen you know time and time again We even saw it in Soviet Russia with the propaganda has
(44:49) to start You don't have a society But I guess because my question would be like what incentive do the men if we have to
(44:55) go through like 20 years of [ __ ] to get a wife like what incentive do the men have to not sleep around well I mean
(45:03) in the current society the only thing that would prevent them from that would be the idea of virtue and religiosity I
(45:09) mean like Z women like from a practical standpoint from looking at your view here from the practical standpoint I
(45:14) would say nothing Yeah that that's my point And I'm not I'm not saying it's good or I'm not saying it's good or bad but I think like they come to that
(45:20) conclusion cuz it's pragmatic I agree Yeah Yeah I agree It's very difficult to to make a normative claim like uh well
(45:28) the normative claim the moral claim that's easy right but it's hard to make a more normalized claim Let's say not
(45:34) normative but normalized claim of uh well you just really shouldn't sleep with a bunch of chicks because it'll
(45:39) have a bad outcome It's like yeah that's like yeah that's a harder like that's a
(45:46) harder line to tow But I do think they look at the married guys who did like the Crowers of the World But I do think
(45:52) that you can make the great case though that it will ultimately have a worse outcome for you as you get older That
(46:00) ultimately it'll have a worse outcome on you as an individual It'll have a worse outcome on you as a man to not have
(46:05) children It'll have a worse outcome for you ultimately I think I think I can demonstrate that pretty easily But um
(46:12) but I'm with you in the idea of like you know yeah trying to tell a bunch of 25-year-old men not to go [ __ ]
(46:18) everything that moves when it's willing to have sex with it That seems like a tall order I get it Uh but I don't think
(46:24) I don't think for practical purposes um ultimately that that the red pill is
(46:30) right on that I think that that the Christian right is more correct on that That the outcomes for most men would be
(46:35) better ultimately served uh and in the short term for society ultimately served
(46:40) by trying to remove promiscuity in these behaviors But if you take like society out of it and go on like an individual
(46:46) basis like if the men that are loyal aren't really getting loyalty back and
(46:52) they're getting divorced it's like where what do they Muslim are Muslim women cheating what do they get like what do
(47:00) they get out of it like I'll tell you Yeah In that case you're right Yeah Right But what about Muslim nations are
(47:05) there women cheating yeah I lived in a very Muslim area They met nations Not
(47:10) not not I met men that were from those areas They they try to No No And I don't
(47:16) need you guys after me so please don't come after me But I'm not going to lie All right You guys your women cheat just
(47:23) the same I've not Do you think women You think women in Afghanistan are cheating as much as women in Los Angeles
(47:30) i've never been to Afghanistan I can't I can't say for sure where they like I
(47:35) have heard many stories um from men that have visited those countries and a lot of the women this is pure a lot of the
(47:41) women that's pure cope listen they're not it's not even the same universe of cheating I would say that this on your
(47:48) your part is pure cope because the truth is is they're not objectively they're not the punishments are so severe right
(47:56) and the fact that you have to have chaperones even for women to walk around they have to have male chaperones to walk them that's not all the Muslim
(48:02) countries though I know it's Not all of them but even in the ones that are more progressive they're not cheating as much There's no way So it's giving a
(48:08) demonstration of like well wait if there is social outcomes so there are ways to govern nations where there's social outcomes for these behaviors It doesn't
(48:16) even need to be that extreme That's way you don't even need to make it where they you know you have to wear a shoe
(48:21) and can't show your We've had this before in this country It wasn't that long ago right but like we're operating
(48:27) in the country we have now You know what I mean and I just don't think there's any incentive with what we have now and
(48:33) not like what could be or what like you know you know what the problem with that argument is is like Rome was full of a
(48:40) bunch of pedestry and homosexuality and all sorts of gross things right and it did reform eventually right there was
(48:47) some destruction which happened but yeah like the virtues have to necessarily switch so you go from Rome to like uh
(48:54) 1800's America 1800s America looks real real straight laced in comparison to
(49:00) Rome right like real straight laced So it's like this idea of oh you can't put it back in the you can't put the [ __ ]
(49:06) back in the horse It's like yeah I'm not I'm not saying that you can't do it I'm saying I wouldn't bet on it happening
(49:12) anytime soon Yeah When Gen Z it's a gradual process And so we have to live
(49:18) in the laws that are governed now And I like I think a lot of times what conservatives miss when they say like
(49:24) men shouldn't sleep around I'm like well you have to give them something for it And right now they're saying like do
(49:29) this for nothing and it's just not a good sell Well I would say do this in hopes that one day we have Afghan laws
(49:35) Look I agree Well that's not what I'm saying I'm not saying hopefully one day we have Afghan laws I'm just pointing
(49:42) out that obviously we can look at so at the social conditions of nations and and the social conditions of societies to
(49:48) see where women are doing these things or not doing these things The western nations is where they're mostly being done That's the primary areas that where
(49:55) sexual liberation is there and this is the primary problem So I would just say
(50:01) this just like it took 80 years for us to get here right it might take just as
(50:07) long to make the gradual transition the other direction You know what I mean but we have some things on our side But yeah
(50:12) you're telling like in 80 years you'll get a wife Like no no I'm not saying in 80 years you get a wife But here's the
(50:18) thing right is like if we follow your prescription Let's just prescription I'm
(50:24) saying all I'm asking is the question is what's in it for the guy like if you're going to sell something if you're going
(50:30) to sell a prescription which I don't do but I'm saying like you have to answer the question what does he get i think
(50:36) that there are virtuous women that men can still get and that they can practically get them and that they exist
(50:42) all over the place and there's millions of them Yeah but Aaron Clary's run the numbers on that That's not true Like if you calculate I've read Aaron Clary's so
(50:49) I've read Aaron Clary's book right but what is if just so you know right 1% of
(50:54) 300 million still three million still a lot of women right and his numbers are not saying 1% are marriageable And what
(51:01) he's giving is he's giving us a a spectrum right he's saying "Look if you're willing to put up with X there's
(51:08) going to be 50% of women available for you If you're willing to put up with Y there's 30%." Right but if you want a
(51:14) chased virgin no tattoo no trauma it's a very small percentage It's like well yeah of course it is But that probably
(51:20) was it's probably always been the case in se sexual liberation that if you wanted a chased virgin women no tattoos
(51:28) no trauma that it's going to be small Promiscuity was even calculated in the study Chastity virginity It was that
(51:34) wasn't in there No no he didn't calculate that It was um debt It was It was tattoos That's true Um it was
(51:41) obesity It was um I think those are the three main thing It was number of tattoos debt and obesity Oh see I would
(51:49) have calculated in chastity too Yeah I know But so he said 1% when you just calculate debt obesity and you know are
(51:56) marriageable Yeah Yeah From from his method Yeah So yeah Okay If you want to pay off a girl's debt Cool But and then
(52:04) that he didn't even include like sex work So like again it's kind of asking the question like what's in it for the
(52:10) average guy I think I think he did include chastity numbers Clary did in his book Now that I'm thinking about it
(52:18) I don't think he did I could be wrong Yeah I'll go back and take a look I have his book so I'll take a look But either
(52:23) either way it doesn't matter Yeah ultimately what I'm saying is like um so
(52:29) so when we're looking at those metrics or you're looking at the metrics for marriageable it's like well let me ask you a question What makes you
(52:35) marriageable nothing Nothing So nothing makes you marriageable no No no Um I mean I have
(52:43) no debt no tattoos I wish I was a little younger but yeah No debt no tattoos No
(52:48) debt no tattoos Um I mean I'm a nice person I can cook Um I'd be a good mom
(52:54) Yeah Yeah Yeah So I would say then that if that those are the categories we're looking at like body count's not even in
(53:00) there This and that Um when we're talking about debt too how much debt like if you come in relationship with
(53:06) $10,000 in debt I don't think care,000 I think the average is $25,000
(53:12) That's still not bad Honestly $25,000 Yeah but the average guy makes like 40,000 a year Yeah And average amount of
(53:19) time it takes off to pay off $25,000 of debt if you're hyperfocused on it Even if you're making,00 but like this isn't a great
(53:26) sell right like that's what I keep asking Like what's in it for the guy now you're saying well you can get a wife
(53:31) but now you No no no I'm just what I'm So here's what I'm saying I'm saying you're these things that you say are uh
(53:38) you know very high like don't do it because it's like okay so should I let
(53:44) me ask you a question Should I pass on a woman if she's hang on if she's very virtuous and she has she'll give me four
(53:49) children She's super fertile because she has $20,000 in debt Should I pass on her that's up to you Yeah But I don't Right
(53:55) But that's what I mean Right That's the thing about the red pill that gets me It's like but we're but you keep switching it I I'm not asking you I'm
(54:02) saying we got to I'm not saying do it or don't do it I'm saying what's in it for the guy A virtuous woman And and I'm
(54:09) saying on a balance of probabilities they can't get that And you can't prove it Can't prove what how would you know
(54:15) if a woman's virtuous yeah but I mean well how do you know anything how But you're dodging the question Like
(54:23) how could you how could you prove that yeah like there's like the way that you can women's sex drive starts at like 16
(54:31) and that's I mean I'm not even going to go and you know but like so the average woman loses her virginity at 16 The
(54:38) average age of first marriage is like 28 So when you're looking at probabilities right um this is what your your big
(54:44) thing is like let's look at the the average and the inks of probability No I'm just I just wanted to answer the
(54:50) question what's in it for the guy like not not do it despite this That's what would be in it for the guy would be a
(54:55) virtuous woman that would give them children and be a good mother to them That's that's that's what they would be moving towards
(55:02) right but on average they're probably not going to get that Yeah There's going to be less of them So there's there's
(55:08) all sorts of mitigation strategies One thing is a mitigation strategy is they get brides from elsewhere That seems to
(55:14) work out for some Oh no Oh no No No You can't do that No You don't you don't like the passport bros no Do you know
(55:21) what if you bring them back here the one of the worst stay you stay there Yeah But no guy wants to move to like in
(55:28) general like women are 85% of travelers So men in general they don't like to
(55:33) travel Like most guys don't like if I had to sell my brothers on move to another country to find a good woman
(55:39) Okay So let me get most people don't want to like uproot their whole lives So let me get this right So then if I were
(55:44) to follow this if I were to follow Pearl Davis's like entire viewpoint here I just want to make sure I get it right
(55:49) I'll steam man it I'm going to steal man Go ahead There's no virtuous women right basically any None Well well okay
(55:56) Basically any There's very few virtuous women And that's true You'd agree that's true I would agree that there's that's
(56:02) true That's like objectively there's not many Yeah I would agree that there's it's less than 50% Yes For sure Okay So
(56:10) we're on the same We agree So because of that men right aren't they're not going
(56:15) to be left with the choice of getting virtuous women Should they just kind of [ __ ] whoever if they feel like it
(56:21) because that's what's left to them I'm saying that's already what's happening Yeah I know And I'm saying I'm saying if
(56:27) we want to But what should happen though well I don't say what should happen I
(56:33) say what is Yeah So I I say I can't I I So what do we do about that though how
(56:38) does that How's that helpful but my question is it is burning It's like well how do we put it out but it is burning
(56:43) Yeah But but the way you're do like you're acting as if I have any control over what the world does I I can't
(56:50) control that I I can't I didn't make this society I can't control how the world is Right I get it So what I'm I
(56:59) just keep asking the question what's in it for the man that would be what would be in it for men And I don't think I
(57:05) don't Right But I don't think there are enough virtuous women that that's going to be a good selling point because it
(57:11) can't be verified for one And probability-wise it's less than 50% Well
(57:16) what's the alternative to it though well it's already what's happening It's why men are like bowing out The sexes are
(57:22) going apart They don't seem like they're happier because they're bowing out They seem like they're happier when they find
(57:27) these vers So let's just say I don't know I've met some I've met some older players They they really are not in a
(57:34) bad place Yeah Most of the guys I talk to who play the field when I talk to them privately they're like I wish I
(57:39) Yeah I get a different story But let's just assume I'm just going to assume the W for a second 15% of women It's not
(57:45) like the guys married are in a better place overall I mean so many men are in
(57:50) like why do you think we have phrases like happy wife happy life well because of if because of sick
(57:57) right but again if if the results were so much better it would be an easy sell Yeah But let's just let's just say it's
(58:03) 15% though Let's just say it's only 15% of women are virtuous Okay Okay Actually let's just do 10 Only 10% of women are
(58:10) virtuous You'd still recommend that women who wanted virtuous men marry those women right
(58:18) sure Yeah Okay I mean sure Yeah So you would still want them but why would you think that they should marry those women
(58:25) well it depends what they want But if if I don't tell men how to live right that's not my place Like if you as a man
(58:32) want to go off and be by yourself till you're 50 I'm not going to tell you that's wrong Why not what if it is
(58:38) because I don't think it is Right So now I don't I don't I don't think it's wrong if a like for a man to live if he live
(58:45) if he lives You're a feminist pearl Sure Wait you're a feminist You're do as thou wilt feminist pearl right but why like
(58:53) why am I to tell a man how to live well you're not telling how to live how to live I think that's out of I think
(58:58) that's out of order Yeah I agree You tell the women how to live You tell those virtuous women they need to marry virtuous men Yeah And you think they'll
(59:04) listen Good luck Well I mean I think that they're more inclined to listen to women than men I don't think so I think
(59:10) so I don't I've I've watched women watch like abortion videos and not care But I mean do and still get one after But do
(59:17) do as thou wilt right is that's brutally like when you say I don't Well I don't
(59:23) care ultimately right i don't I don't really care I'm like you should care though because
(59:28) ultimately the reason you say those 10% it's out of order for me to tell a guy how to live right i think that's out of
(59:35) order Like I don't think that's my place Okay but here's what I'm trying to explain If you think those 10% of women
(59:41) who are virtuous should marry like the 10 or you should get married to virtuous
(59:46) men if they want to The women not the men If they I mean they could be nuns if they want They could I It's not my place
(59:53) to forget the nunnery but if they want to get married they shouldn't marry shitbags They should marry virtuous men
(59:58) right if that's what they want to do If that's what they want Okay Okay So I mean so if you're just diving into even
(1:00:05) if they're virtuous you're not sure I'm like even if they're virtuous I'm not
(1:00:10) sure what they should do That's where I'm like well my again it's not my place
(1:00:15) Like you have to live with the consequences of your actions And I just think a lot of YouTubers get like a god
(1:00:21) complex where they want to tell everyone how to live And it's not my place it's your life Yeah But I mean like it's if
(1:00:29) you you get to live life on your own terms You Well would you tell would you tell men like not to become [ __ ]
(1:00:35) i mean if they want to do that I'd rather they didn't But see okay there we go I'd rather not I'd rather they didn't
(1:00:42) I'd rather not I don't really want to look at them but but let's keep that
(1:00:47) convers would you tell uh would you tell men like um so you wouldn't make any
(1:00:52) recommendations like what if a man was like I want to be a homosexual and have 20 gay lovers well I I could give what I
(1:01:01) think is right and wrong and that's my personal opinion but that's that's not what I'm here to do I'm here to stick to
(1:01:07) the facts Got it But this is great right so it's not a God complex then So if you're saying I know what's right and I
(1:01:14) know what's wrong then you according but according to my worldview Yeah So you would tailor that worldview though to
(1:01:20) the outcomes you wanted to see in society That's not a God complex That's just like picking your neighbors Right
(1:01:26) Right But I I don't agree because again I think that every man has a right to
(1:01:31) live life on his own terms And you're kind of dodging the question which ask it directly and I'll give you a yes
(1:01:37) Which is what's in it for the men what's what is in it for him so I'll I'll
(1:01:42) repeat it again What does a man get out of a out of which thing a marriage Yeah
(1:01:47) Yeah What he would get or what he'd be seeking for a marriage would be a virtuous non-vexing wife who gave him
(1:01:53) children was a good mother But we agree that most men aren't going to get that correct We would agree that because
(1:01:59) that's less than 50% Yes we would agree that that is the case Correct And until conservatives can answer that question
(1:02:05) for men it's going to keep going down I'm not saying it's good Didn't I just answer the question though what yeah So
(1:02:12) what what what is it that they're getting out of marriage or what is it that they should be wanting and getting out of Not should I said what but what
(1:02:19) are they getting now oh descriptively Yes Yeah And and that's my that's what I'm getting at is Yeah No but but we
(1:02:25) already agree descriptively that's the case What I'm after is the next part where we're like "Okay so what the [ __ ]
(1:02:31) we got to do about this shit?" That's what I'm at Well you maybe you can start
(1:02:36) and change the laws and whatever I just don't see it happening in my lifetime
(1:02:42) Really you don't think so you don't think there's any possibility that people people can run a social movement
(1:02:47) to change any of this stuff um I don't see any evidence that it's going to happen Yeah I mean the whole economy is
(1:02:55) run on the female dollar Women make eight like I always look at it as women you make $8 off of women and $2 off of
(1:03:02) men for like the pink tax The pink tax make women make 80% of consumer
(1:03:09) buying decisions So there's so many industries that just depend off of women working Sure And women spending money
(1:03:16) and I just don't see it changing I I hope you know I hope you're right It changed Well I mean I I hope you're
(1:03:21) right How does the propaganda work though that gets all the women in the workforce against their will and all the propaganda can't work to get them out of
(1:03:28) the workforce well I don't think it's propaganda like that I think it's what women want to do
(1:03:33) Women want to do what women wanted to work Women didn't want to have to work Definitely not And they definitely uh it
(1:03:41) seems like when I look at the regrets that I hear from women more than anything by the time they hit their 40s
(1:03:47) was that they did that [ __ ] and that they feel like they were completely lied to about it Yeah that's what they say
(1:03:52) But that's kind of like a fat person like saying they want to lose weight but they don't take any steps to like make
(1:03:58) it happen They don't really want to lose weight I mean that's common Like if women you know if women have like we get thousands of options on a dating app
(1:04:05) right So it's like if you wanted to you would but we don't So what does that tell you
(1:04:10) it's not what we want to do Well so wait okay that doesn't follow either It is
(1:04:16) the case that I want to draw that I wish I was good at art right but I don't really take any steps to get better at
(1:04:22) art but I still wish I was better at art But if you really wanted to be good at it you take steps to do it Yeah Not
(1:04:30) necessarily Like that doesn't follow for everything You know what I mean like people can envision that they would want a thing or regret not having the thing
(1:04:37) and then time work But how can you tell what people actually want to do and if they mean something they do it right
(1:04:44) like if someone really wants to lose weight they take the steps to do it They hire a personal trainer whatever they
(1:04:50) got to do People can say things right but I watch what they do But hang on Putting something into action doesn't
(1:04:56) mean it's not a thing you don't want Like there's lots of people I know who wish that that they were millionaires
(1:05:01) They're not taking actions to become millionaires but they still wish they had a million bucks for sure And I don't
(1:05:07) disbelieve that they really wish they had a million bucks because they're not taking actionable steps to get it Like
(1:05:13) that to me doesn't follow I do You You just instantly think that they're just Yeah If you wanted to you would If you
(1:05:19) wanted to you would Yeah If you wanted to So that's that's how I view it I don't know I don't I'm not as black and
(1:05:26) jade I don't know I'm not jaded but I just look at the way the trends are going and I don't I don't want to like
(1:05:32) lie or you know um and I'm not I'm not saying you are but I'm saying like to me
(1:05:37) it would be lying if I said that I don't predict it's going to go this way Yeah It's going to get worse Yeah Yeah But
(1:05:44) but but I would look at it as a series of is like again so when I answer the
(1:05:49) question I say well I agree with you descriptively You're correct This is bad This is the part of the red pill I agree with Descriptively this is bad But then
(1:05:56) I get to the part where I'm like "Yeah I see the fire Look at that big tower It's on fire." Yeah I see it too So anyway hey guys you want to like help me put
(1:06:02) this out and they're like "No that's you can't just you can't just put out a
(1:06:08) fire." But would you help put it out if you knew you were going to die in the process and I think that's what a lot of
(1:06:13) conservative like you know men are nine times more likely to commit suicide after a divorce And the worst um the
(1:06:20) worst men that I saw actually telling men to gamble on non-verirtuous women right you don't women like virtuous
(1:06:27) right now You don't know what they're going to do in 10 years You don't know Like I one of my biggest donors for the documentary just don't buy a new car cuz
(1:06:33) it could break down One of my biggest donors for the documentary you know he had a 30-year marriage and now he's
(1:06:39) going to work till he's dead because she decid she was virtuous She didn't cheat the whole time That's stupid It's like saying don't buy a car cuz it might
(1:06:46) break down I wouldn't say it's the same because if it if a car breaks down like
(1:06:51) you can fix it you can buy a new car Yeah But you're not enslaved to the car
(1:06:57) for 18 years Well you are if you bought it with debt right you bought it with
(1:07:02) debt you're still enslaved to it for x amount of time But the thing is is like look but I wouldn't if you're taking
(1:07:07) look at risk mitigation You're supposed to be looking at all these things and details like you buy the new car not
(1:07:13) knowing that it won't break down cuz it could but you have enough assured factors that it so likely won't that you
(1:07:19) feel okay doing it So like trying to create this guarantee of well you don't really know if they're faking virtue
(1:07:25) right at this moment It's like they could be but you're supposed to take all the evidence into consideration to make
(1:07:30) a better choice on that Right But two kids is 40% of your income for 18 years I mean that's a lot I mean that I mean I
(1:07:38) again like nobody's answering the question What's in it for the guy to take that risk well if because if she if
(1:07:44) she she might be virtuous now What risk just the risk of marriage itself That's it Well I what I'm saying is the
(1:07:50) conservatives in general they're not going to sell marriage to men even with so-called like virtuous women um because
(1:07:58) they're not answer they're not giving men enough of an incentive And it's easy to say like we ought to do this I think
(1:08:05) you could maybe say that like in your Well I would just mitigate the [ __ ] out of everything So you can get a prenuptual agreement You can look for
(1:08:11) virtuous women You can hyper focus but those can be like thrown out and they rarely are And I talked to James Ston
(1:08:16) live about it and he told me they rarely are Do the divorce lawyers have an incentive to be honest about that or to
(1:08:22) lie i don't think James Sexton was I really like James I have nothing I have nothing against him but um with lawyers
(1:08:30) I just am a bit skeptical And the reason being um they're mostly enforced Like I
(1:08:36) checked it out They're mostly enforced Prenuptual agreements are mostly enforced I mean that's what they say
(1:08:42) right um but I just think there's a lot of incentive for divorce lawyers to not be overly honest about that And the
(1:08:49) other thing that lawyers will tell you is once you have a kid that's really when it switches So you might be okay if
(1:08:55) you don't have a child but if you have but now you're moving away from the descriptive truth into like Pearl's
(1:09:00) truth The descriptive truth and the facts on this one are not are not on your side Not when it comes to kids
(1:09:08) because once it comes prenups like prenups definitely work right no but the
(1:09:13) you might say they're enforced but a lot of times the terms are changed That's not uncommon Sometimes the terms are
(1:09:19) changed That's true But most of the time prenups are enforced and uh women who sign prenups are way less likely to
(1:09:26) violate their duties in the marriage because they don't want to lose whatever the thing is right but you don't know how the women are going to be in the
(1:09:33) future right so like there might be like we're talking about Gen Z women I would
(1:09:38) say young millennials that are really on the market and you have no like you can't say that they're less likely to
(1:09:44) divor like this is the this is the first group of women that grew up on social media So if I had to predict it I would
(1:09:51) guess that they would be worse because I don't think social media has made relationships well they're going to get
(1:09:58) married less like altogether marriage is decreasing right but even the ones that do get married they can download a
(1:10:04) dating app they can cheat on Instagram like you so and I'm not saying if a man wants to get married I would never talk
(1:10:10) him out of I think all of the incentives against secular marriage are in your favor like I'm not disputing
(1:10:16) descriptively all of the of the ideas for secular marriage are definitely in
(1:10:22) your favor but they're they're not in your favor when it comes to religious marriage they're not in your favor If it
(1:10:27) is the case you keep the state out of it got married by the church had a prenuptual agreement you can really protect yourself pretty well from most
(1:10:34) of these mitigating factors and get that virtuous woman you're after right but there's no God in divorce court And so
(1:10:40) the worst divorce that I saw was from divorce court The worst no the worst divorce that I no second no they were
(1:10:48) both religious actually One was um the two worst divorce I saw one was from the same church that Michael Nolles goes to
(1:10:54) How were they getting a divorce though if they got married through through a party other than the state they couldn't
(1:10:59) have gotten divorced right but once you have a kid you're entered into the like once once you have a child you're
(1:11:05) entered into the state regardless Yeah Yeah So for custody though Yeah And then for child support correct but but here's
(1:11:12) the thing it's interesting there You can still write mitigation for that in a prenuptual agreement even when it comes
(1:11:19) to child support and they're mostly enforced right you you can but again what's the incentive well the incentive
(1:11:26) that men would be receiving on the end is I don't believe is is as you do that
(1:11:32) um that you know you just can't get married to women because there's no virtuous women But assuming even there's
(1:11:37) a very small percentage I would still recommend that men find virtuous women get married to them and the incentive that they get as families and this and
(1:11:43) that Do I think you can't mitigate all those risks i think you can and should I'm in the business of predicting right
(1:11:49) i like to predict where things are going And so when I do that I have to put myself in someone else's shoes And
(1:11:56) that's what I'm trying to get at when I keep asking you this question is what's in it for men and I don't think until
(1:12:03) conservatives can like if I saw a difference and we said earlier there's no difference between liberal and
(1:12:09) conservative I guess maybe I just don't understand what you're asking because I feel like I keep giving you a great answer but then you just reass So what
(1:12:16) is the what is the question you're actually what are men getting out of marriage that would move them towards
(1:12:22) marriage well I just I was trying to I thought you would agree with me on this actually So I was kind of it's kind of
(1:12:27) interesting rubbing a back and forth like Well I agree with you on secular marriage I think that that's generally
(1:12:33) speaking I wouldn't I wouldn't tell people to go and get secular marriage I think that that's probably a recipe for
(1:12:38) disaster But when I look at all the data I look at shows me this If you're heavily religious and you move towards a
(1:12:45) woman who has virtues and you can associate the virtues with things like chastity other things like this and then
(1:12:50) you you mitigate it by a keeping the state out of it and then b having some
(1:12:55) type of prenuptual agreement even a relationship agreement right which are also enforceable But if even if you got
(1:13:02) married through the state and you had a prenup you're pretty I mean you're way ahead of the curve on this Like women
(1:13:07) are way more inclined to behave and everything else if that's in place I totally agree that they're ahead of the
(1:13:12) curve and they're way better than a guy that didn't predict that at all Um I also agree that that's probably the
(1:13:19) better route to go if they're going to go down that route I just don't think What's your incentive to [ __ ] a bunch of
(1:13:25) different hoes just that it's fun Yeah Like it's just fun Come on So so I mean
(1:13:31) it seems like it seems like all the incentives are in my No you What's the incentive to have sex with a bunch of
(1:13:36) different women hose Yeah because men like hot women Yeah [ __ ] 5,000 you know
(1:13:43) So so I mean so you're just saying that the incentive is like funsies me more funsies I would say that's the incentive
(1:13:49) Yeah that's a ter But that's a terrible message ultimately right but I'm not saying it's again I'm in the business of predicting Yeah But even on the
(1:13:55) predictive message by the time by the time these men are in their 30s and 40s they're not after funsies hoes That's
(1:14:02) not what most men are at at that age They want to settle down have wife and kids usually 10 years younger Yeah They
(1:14:07) want him 10 years younger So it so it's it would make sense for them to [ __ ] around until she graduates Yeah But even
(1:14:13) if even if I were to grant that to just like a 20 years 20 years go sew your wild oats If ultimately you're going to
(1:14:19) get married you're still going to be moving towards woman of virtue prenup all these No totally totally I totally
(1:14:24) agree But like I I was just asking like I think there's better incentive for men to get married than there is to play the
(1:14:30) field For sure Your STDs are a big problem right huge problem Other problem is women are [ __ ] crazy They baby
(1:14:37) trap you They do all kinds of crazy ass [ __ ] to you right but when you have men like Crowder who get the virgin wife
(1:14:42) with no and I and I I mean we know we I love Crowder but like he got the picture perfect wife that like they were on the
(1:14:49) cover of magazines whatever and she ruined his life Men are going to look at that and you're going to say "Well
(1:14:54) what's the difference?" The difference is tactical mistakes which were made The idea of prenuptual agreements like let's
(1:15:01) say this but it wasn't the prenup It was the leaked footage to the press right that was probably the worst Like the
(1:15:06) worst part about a put in prenuptual agreements They can't release things to the press even Oh yeah Like that stopped
(1:15:12) What ashley it's not a joke You really can Ashley St Clair was offered $10 million
(1:15:17) and she still couldn't shut up I bet you that they wasn't in the agreement I bet it wasn't in the agreement And if she
(1:15:23) violated it and Elon Musk enforced it I bet you it would get enforced The thing is is like highprofile high status men
(1:15:29) I've seen the types of agreements that they make with women and they areing insane They're 300 pages long cover
(1:15:36) their whole empire covers all sorts of things But even average guys can have a lawyer draft up a prenuptual agreement
(1:15:42) which will which will greatly mitigate this damage which is done if a woman is faking virtue Can women fake virtue of
(1:15:49) course right could they switch in 10 years could they just like lose their [ __ ] and become lunatics yeah It's
(1:15:55) always a good idea to have that in And here's the thing I would ask you back Isn't it always better to have one than
(1:16:01) not It's like a gun right i as I said earlier if they're going to go down that
(1:16:06) route I totally think the way men have every incentive to go down that route I think the way that you're describing if
(1:16:12) if they're going to go down that route they're going to go down that route I think if the incentives were there more
(1:16:18) men would do it But I don't Well men want kids so you they're not they don't Having kids with hoes is a recipe for
(1:16:24) disaster You know what I mean having kids with a wife and having prenuptual
(1:16:30) agreements these types of agreements in place the vetting for virtue in place Way better I mean what are you going to
(1:16:36) do just go like impregnate some chick like Ashley St Clair How'd that work it didn't work out there Terrible idea He
(1:16:42) has way too much money to not have a vetting process
(1:16:47) I'm like Elon let me do it Yeah exactly I'm like I'll put the hose right here And I'm like but I I just don't think
(1:16:54) that the idea of like I'm not saying they should or they shouldn't I think if men want kids they have a right to go do
(1:17:00) that And the way you're describing is great Yeah But I think I think that if I had to predict
(1:17:07) where things are going to go I think it's going to disappear because especially from the middle class
(1:17:12) marriage I think it's really just going to be for the elite and the rich Well I'm going to do everything in my power
(1:17:18) in the interim time as the lowly YouTuber who I can't do much to try to
(1:17:23) at least assist with the mitigation and the entire fall of the you know of the West which I I I actually still love the
(1:17:29) West Yeah And I still love the country that I'm in surprisingly I still do And the people who are in it I don't want to
(1:17:35) see men uh suffer horrid you know these kind of horrid fates which happen when
(1:17:40) there is actually a lot of mitigation they could do to take care of that And then when you say there's no selling point it's like I hear the opposite When
(1:17:47) I see the guys are like "Oh yeah I spent my 20s and 30s doing drugs getting high and banging chicks every one of them
(1:17:52) ends up in front of that old rugged cross going I wish I hadn't done that." And had instead focused on a family You
(1:17:59) say "I've met some players who say the opposite." Where are they i haven't met him They're not in my discourse Yeah you
(1:18:04) have I mean um like Troy Francis he's happy guy Oh come on He's alto fe He's a
(1:18:10) feminist thought through He admitted to me live that he was absolutely a feminist It's like yeah I've told you
(1:18:17) before left-wing men they're the primary beneic beneficiaries of promiscuous
(1:18:22) women because they want that Well I think that the only solution to feminism is more feminism When women start
(1:18:28) getting treated like men and having the consequences that men have like that's when I I think and you might think
(1:18:33) otherwise but I think that's No I agree with that I don't think that's more feminism though think it's just I I
(1:18:39) think that the idea of of female accountability went from they're a witch burn them men accountability to to now
(1:18:48) like they can do no wrong right and I I I'm I'm think necessary and it's the only way to
(1:18:55) fix ultimately what this issue is is allowing accountability to happen But I don't think that that has anything to do
(1:19:00) with feminism I think it has to do with patriarchy Good patriarchies allow for female
(1:19:05) accountability And we've just like gotten away from that because of the simp the what simple I call it sympic
(1:19:12) you call it Yeah So so what would you if you were in charge what would you Oh I
(1:19:17) don't make prescriptive statements I just look at things that are burning and say let it you know I mean you're you're
(1:19:23) the prescriptor So back so back to prescriptions the describer You're the prescription What was the what was the
(1:19:28) question you're a man That's what you should be doing That's right That's right That's fair What's the uh what's the question so like if you were in
(1:19:34) charge like what would you do i would start a top- down propaganda campaign If I was the unilateral like dictator of
(1:19:40) the United States government I would start a top-own propaganda campaign and spend about 10% of my GDP on it tearing
(1:19:46) down every single billboard and erecting ones all over the nation tearing down every bit of LGBTQ pro- feminist uh you
(1:19:52) know ideology anywhere I could find it Replace it with the family unit everywhere you looked and do a mass
(1:19:59) promotion of this right everywhere they were starting when they were in their school years And I would do it I've run
(1:20:04) it for 30 years and I guarantee you a lot of this problem would begin to shift
(1:20:11) very very very quickly So that's the very first thing that I would start with
(1:20:16) Uh if you wanted like more prescriptions than that I would get rid of gay marriage I would get rid of no fault divorce I would get rid I mean the
(1:20:22) amount of things that I would get rid of unilaterally day one would be overwhelming Would you ever
(1:20:29) Sorry Would you ever um run for office because you actually have like a real background unlike most YouTubers you
(1:20:37) know Yeah I would I would I would I think people would actually vote for you You wouldn't run I would get shot I
(1:20:43) think I I really believe that I would I think I would Well the thing is is like
(1:20:48) I would show up to to these debates right and I would cut Oh my god Yeah I
(1:20:53) think I would get very Did you run for the entertainment yeah I think I would get very popular very quickly But the thing is is like
(1:21:00) I I think I would get shot Really yeah Yeah And I also think that what I do
(1:21:06) right now is in some ways more effective The Crucible acts as like a special forces We can get where people aren't
(1:21:13) and deliver those messages to like Tommy Lauren and the rest of them which I agree Look here's the thing for the
(1:21:18) audience because this kind of turned into a debate We descriptively agree on a lot We really do It's the
(1:21:25) prescriptions that we start to that's where we really start to deviate where I'm like look I think we can do some
(1:21:30) stuff to start to put this out and that men collectively have way more power than you think I'm blackpilled You're right I know you're just blackpilled but
(1:21:37) we got to try to got to try to bring it You're not I'm not I'm because when I
(1:21:42) hear the feedback when I hear the feedback from thousands from the thousands thousands of people contact me
(1:21:48) it's the opposite They're like "Look when I shifted my priority to start looking for the things I consider virtue
(1:21:54) to be I started to see that there's a whole different arena of women who actually are available." I didn't know
(1:21:59) what you know what I was even what I was even really trying for So I think you're right It's a matter of goals What's goal
(1:22:05) one i think I think men do want to have a family And I don't think that playing the playing the field is not very
(1:22:10) satisfying for very long Like oh it's exhausting Yeah Yeah one for what one
(1:22:16) year two years and then okay that's old You know what I mean so yeah they tend to want to gravitate towards success in
(1:22:22) family ultimately And this is every one of these major red pillars I talk to on the side tell me this So do you know
(1:22:30) what i'll tell you what blackpilled me with that I mean there is just a lot of um people that say they want monogamy
(1:22:39) um like commentators and stuff a lot of them are cheating on their wives like a lot of course and so it's like same
(1:22:46) thing with preachers right they'll be like "Homosexuality is wrong." And then they get caught sucking a dick in a parking lot No No No No Exactly So it's
(1:22:53) like if that's what they wanted why is it like why aren't they doing it yeah So it kind of I won't lie blackpilled me
(1:23:00) even more Yeah So how are you not blackpilled with like you do probably
(1:23:05) because I don't cheat That's right You don't cheat on my wife Not you But like like not with that I meant with the
(1:23:12) eight hour debates you do How do you Sorry I'm like because I listen I
(1:23:19) try to listen to the totality of the collective of people contacting after and a lot of them are actually women and
(1:23:25) they're like look there's actually a lot you say here that's that's pretty hard to get away from when it's when it's
(1:23:32) kind of logically explained and you know like a lot of them actually start with me and my husband got into a fight over
(1:23:38) over this and you know you're kind of right about it the thing is is um I
(1:23:44) understand the idea of asking the question which feels unanswerable like
(1:23:49) what do we do about the fact that descriptively you're right there's less virtuous women likely than there are men
(1:23:55) in much smaller numbers right and more men are going to want to get married than than are going to be able to get
(1:24:01) married to good women but here's the thing classically in history you know this as well very few men ever got to
(1:24:07) reproduce anyway that's true it was very very small the amount of men who ever got to reproduce in the first
(1:24:14) So we're not really all that far off anyhow That's totally I almost think it's like nature correcting itself It is
(1:24:19) Well it I call it the great correction The birth rate is great It's part of a great correction The thing is you're
(1:24:25) like what do you do about a problem which is correcting itself
(1:24:31) for me i'm like don't be black because there's still millions and millions of good women There really are Well I'm
(1:24:37) optimistic for my life but I just I look at the trends and I'm like well I I think this is where it's go Like I've
(1:24:44) had women also contact me and say you know things but I just don't believe
(1:24:49) them because I've seen because you're so blackpilled Yeah No I've seen women say things and like how often do we really
(1:24:56) mean it when you look and you're right when you look at the trends there's a lot there Southern said things and she
(1:25:02) banged destiny I know But there is a lot there blue-eyed blonde Arian But hang on
(1:25:08) Hang on In my defense In my defense Yeah Go No Go ahead Go Haven't I been right about basically everything I've ever
(1:25:14) told you to do no I know you've been right about a lot So I hope you're right I'm not been right about I didn't mean
(1:25:19) to turn it into a debate I thought we were going to love debates What do you mean but but yeah the thing is is um we
(1:25:25) do actually agree on a lot of the trends and how a lot of them are going to be going for a little while right but where
(1:25:31) I deviate is like there seems to be yes there is a correction going on Most men traditionally were never able to
(1:25:37) reproduce anyhow And ultimately we're in a position right now where yes you can you you actually can find virtuous women
(1:25:44) and you should probably have as many children with them as you can outreed the other side completely destroy them
(1:25:50) in every mechanism but it's going to take a while It's not going to be fast So but what's your like what about the
(1:25:55) men that the women don't select for marriage what are they supposed to do the same thing that men always did when
(1:26:00) they weren't selected The thing Well the same things that men always did when they weren't selected They joined the military They became celibate This type
(1:26:07) of thing And that was most tough That was most men That's a tough cell They're going to just How is it a tough cell
(1:26:13) when that's all of human history so you don't get to reproduce anyways And you're telling the guys be celibate or
(1:26:18) bend and not reproduce Like one they don't get they get to watch But this refutes your
(1:26:24) argument not mine You agree with me that throughout all of human history if we look at it correct correct Most men
(1:26:31) could not reproduce So why all of a sudden are they supposed to Pearl well what no What I'm saying I'm not saying
(1:26:36) they should or they shouldn't I know you're going to you're going to make you're going to make fun of me Yeah they couldn't but they never could Some guys
(1:26:42) are selected for sex but they're not selected for children Yeah Like the women will abort their kids So those
(1:26:47) guys like what's the incentive you get to be celibate the rest of your life or you get to bang What was their incentive
(1:26:52) 300 years ago um well it probably wasn't as easy right so well yeah so now they can just dial
(1:26:59) on Instagram well before you didn't have monogamy so I mean now women are going to have to make these select and they
(1:27:06) had to right for a long time especially when they were social pariah but it's like you can't go well so for some
(1:27:12) reason modern man needs to have more choices than his ancestors 400 years ago had It's like why the truth of the
(1:27:18) matter is it's like attraction is attraction Resources are resources Correct Women are going to go for men they're attracted to and have resources
(1:27:24) Well that's why that's why I said I think marriage is going to just be for the upper class No it's never Well look it's I think it's disappearing I think
(1:27:31) it's disappearing from the middle class It's not disappearing for the poor and it's not disappearing Well it is
(1:27:37) actually It's more disappearing for the rich now The rich it's more disappearing for I'd have to double check but I'm
(1:27:43) pretty sure it's more common for the upper class The upper class yes The very
(1:27:48) rich no The very rich no Upper class sure But the upper class would now be
(1:27:53) what you would consider upper class was middle class Well I guess what do you what do you like what bracket are you
(1:27:59) talking about yeah So when I'm talking about the super rich right or elitist rich um we're talking about a million
(1:28:06) plus dollars per year Okay Right That's a very small very very small number Now what you're talking about is like the
(1:28:12) college grads with a combined income of you know 125 or 130 plus Yes that is the
(1:28:18) case that there's trends and upticks from and even those marriages staying longer They have more longevity even uh
(1:28:24) I think it's because of um other factors but I won't even get into it Uh but ultimately I don't think it's the idea
(1:28:31) of marriage is only going to be for the overclass Well my point is more a lot of men aren't selected for it anyway Yeah
(1:28:38) Right So but for those men like they're like it's not going to be a selling point to them to be celibate forever
(1:28:45) They're just going to run through hoes No I Well listen Listen Well I agree But they're getting selected then right for
(1:28:51) sex But like they'll just abort their kids Yeah I know They're not getting selected for reproduction But most men
(1:28:57) never were selected for reproduction I'm not saying but like my point is you know
(1:29:02) you're just not going to sell them on celibacy forever Yeah Yeah Good luck Yeah You wouldn't you wouldn't sell them
(1:29:08) on celibacy forever right but you could sell women on celibacy forever if it were the case that they thought Oh yeah
(1:29:14) If it if it if it were the case that they thought they'd become social paras How do I know because I can look back a
(1:29:20) hundred years and see it They got the scarlet [ __ ] letter They got shaved bald They got messed up They got turned
(1:29:26) into social paras for doing it Yeah I I just don't see that happening in anytime
(1:29:31) soon Why why um I mean women are putting their buttholes on the internet and now
(1:29:36) get to be Jesus preachers But again if you can go as we saw if you can go from
(1:29:42) you can get tag teamed on camera and then be a Jesus But if you can go from the worst societies on earth to some of
(1:29:47) the most straight laced it's like we've seen that happen multiple times I hope it does I just have to go off of what
(1:29:54) I've seen in my lifetime right and I've heard cons like I I'm an OG conservative
(1:29:59) Daily Wire watcher and I felt a bit lied to because they would kind of sell me that this is coming and then time went
(1:30:07) by and there's no indication that it is Well they weren't moving towards anything either Well I mean totally true
(1:30:12) Yeah Like I would love to see and look you got to debate these Why would they let me there but they don't like you
(1:30:19) bigger Descriptively it is the case that again most of these things you're saying
(1:30:25) are true Yeah but it's it's we know this Now where do we go do I have all the answers [ __ ] no I don't have all the
(1:30:31) answers Not even close But at least we should be looking at them Those guys won't even look at them Mhm They won't
(1:30:36) even look at a single one of them as as issues They're just like "This is just isn't even happening." You know even um
(1:30:44) who's the the latest one the uh the guy who did all the the tea stuff u Matt
(1:30:49) Walsh even he as he's starting to kind of move a little bit more towards this even he's he still won't acknowledge
(1:30:55) that many of the fundamental things you're talking about when it comes to hypergamy and things like this are in
(1:31:01) fact happening via the trends lines I agree with that but the question becomes how do we combat that and what do we do
(1:31:07) about that I do think propaganda can be a very useful tool and I think that the Christian right has way more at their
(1:31:13) disposal than you think especially with legal legalization criminalization of various things Look at what
(1:31:18) decriminalizing drugs did You think that that didn't make marijuana popular everywhere when they decriminalized it
(1:31:23) they were like "Nope it's only going to be the people who still smoke marijuana and now they're just going to be able to
(1:31:28) not go to jail for it." It didn't do that It completely popularized it everywhere It popularized it everywhere
(1:31:35) So if you decriminalize prostitution and of things like that does the same [ __ ] It popularizes it I know But there's
(1:31:42) just so much in like I still think back to $8 or $2 I don't think there's any
(1:31:47) incentive for them to do any of these things because they either need the female voting block or they need the $8
(1:31:54) from women That's why I don't predict Yeah Yeah Yeah So like you know the Daily Wire I'm sure their biggest donors
(1:32:02) um are either Well I'm sure there's rich donors I know there's like the brothers
(1:32:07) or whatever Um brothers I know there's some brothers that fund
(1:32:13) the Daily Wire I don't remember It's the Koch brothers not maybe I don't I don't know Some some rich guys but I would
(1:32:20) guess they get a good amount of money or a significant enough amount of money from women somehow I don't know how I
(1:32:26) don't know if it's their memberships their documentaries the housewives they're selling to There's some because
(1:32:32) they're not being honest And whenever I see people like lying I can always guess that there's a woman involved Yeah Yeah
(1:32:40) which is great Somehow a woman like the ads for I mean you know on YouTube the ads for women it's like you get like two
(1:32:46) female viewers and you can make so much money off of that Yep Yeah Just cuz the
(1:32:52) demographic like do I want to make 20% of my income or 80% Like most people are just Yeah I think though Yeah That's why
(1:32:59) I'm blackpilled I'm like why would they do it i would just end in the conversation this way I would say don't
(1:33:05) be so blackpilled While it's true that the that a lot of the data trends look bad I can show you times in history
(1:33:11) where they've looked a lot worse Really what time in history you mean for for which nation sure No I'm just go ahead
(1:33:17) So I mean if we were to go back and we were to look at um the Soviet Union for instance right and we saw what happened
(1:33:24) to their population They decimated it with abortion right you can see that there's recoveries that went on and are
(1:33:31) still going on They're still ongoing And it's like some of these things have a way of equalizing themselves over time
(1:33:37) you know they they just do So it's like yeah it sucks that you're in the generation that this happens to but you
(1:33:43) can still make good political progress towards solutions to these issues I hope you're right Yeah You know I hope I just
(1:33:51) wouldn't bet on it Yeah I just if I was a betting woman Well not with that attitude you know All right
(1:33:58) Let me go through super chats really quick Do you mind scrolling up
(1:34:06) Wow Your your people are very generous This is the most super chats we've gotten in a while Yeah they're uh
(1:34:12) they're awesome It's because I haven't been over grifting them lately Usually I'll go on and I'll and you know I
(1:34:18) haven't even got I've just got home from my trip last night and then made the trip out here Okay So I haven't even had a chance to go live explain to him my
(1:34:24) trip all the grifting because it was like well I got to go out and talk with Pearl Now it's the Pearl Davis Andrew Wilson debate I guess So that's what
(1:34:31) happened I'm sorry I'm I'm all for it I'm all for it Um if liberal women or Coca-Cola conservative women are Diet
(1:34:38) Coke go down Candace Owen's husband is worth over $150 million She doesn't have

(1:35:18) a wife and three kids at 20 The differences uh to the next is that we took a commitment at the church very
(1:35:24) seriously the actual wedding day activities were the least of the concern Yeah but Pearl thinks she's faking Pearl
(1:35:30) thinks she's going to change on a dime In 5 years it's over buddy I've seen I've seen very religious women change on
(1:35:37) a D I've seen Look I'm not saying it doesn't happen I'm just saying don't you think that that's a better mitigation
(1:35:42) for risk ultimately that's what we're looking at right now No I I agree with you on that but um we're just looking
(1:35:48) for risk mitigation right all right It's pretty awesome getting both of you to chat I love you both Don't tear each other's heads off Oh it's all in good
(1:35:55) fun Pearl's been a a close personal friend and will remain So um now get Jake Yeah you guys are the best Um now
(1:36:02) get Jake and Jim Bob in the same room I only need to go to one place That's true
(1:36:08) Doug MPA agrees with you That's my moderator He says "Gen Alpha men are going to be based The women are going to
(1:36:14) still be Jen Alpha men are um going to disengage
(1:36:20) from the US women and get passports go down Possible Um Andrew is an absolute legend Protect this man at all costs
(1:36:26) Alex B usually agree with Andrew but his argument just do it broke kind of sounds like conservative women Hardly That was
(1:36:33) not my argument at all Alex B was just do it Okay this one's going to go for me It's all right Pearl you're too
(1:36:38) blackpilled I'm single and depressed be uh be lucky to have what Andrew is
(1:36:44) describing Um I believe um Ken Kim Cam says "I
(1:36:50) believe what Pearl's saying here is try convincing power to give up power Women in society today are drunk with power is
(1:36:56) her point." Um Peter RT wouldn't I wouldn't dispute that Is Andrew an alpha
(1:37:02) beta or other ultimate alpha right yeah I don't go for the the alpha hierarchy
(1:37:09) but not not my thing No I know it's tough Um the but of course I'm a [ __ ]
(1:37:14) No I'm kidding Okay Um love Andrew and Pearl but I
(1:37:20) agree with Pearl Um ways to protect yourself Yes Andrew The uphill battle to protect yourself isn't appealing or an
(1:37:26) incentive for marriage Peter Ortiz Marry Me Pearl What's Well hang on I think um
(1:37:32) like it's very bizarre to me because I know that I did not make that argument
(1:37:37) So I don't know why that's what you're going after Well I think it was my argument was descriptively this is
(1:37:43) correct Prescriptively it's wrong And and you would have to concede that these mitigations do work and that if men want
(1:37:50) to have families are going to have to marry women What kind of women are you going to marry so I don't even know
(1:37:55) what's what's there to dispute Very cool to see two greats here redeeming the culture I think virtue can be discerned
(1:38:03) Knowledge of the past friends family social media It's very telling with good counsel can determine and a PI Um
(1:38:09) Pearl's point is example If 85% of men are marriageable society still surviving
(1:38:15) and 85% of women are not marriageable birth rates are low That is not incentive That is not enough
(1:38:21) incentivizing women to turn things around They would need to right without propaganda Hold on Can I read the end
(1:38:27) then you can go without propaganda you can't change the culture and controlling majority of advertisements you can't
(1:38:32) change the culture Women's buying power controls advertise advertising in my opinion a collapse is a must Yeah So you
(1:38:40) got a couple things wrong One yes propaganda can change the buying culture of women We've seen it happen before
(1:38:46) This was done during the Vietnam War in fact and during the Korean War So yes I can look at wartime propaganda and see
(1:38:52) how much you can change the patterns of how women behave and how men behave Also the the second point that I would
(1:38:58) mitigate off of when you say "Well wait a second If 85% of of women aren't
(1:39:03) getting married or having children it's like well that's a self-correcting problem then If they're not having children not reproducing it would still
(1:39:09) be the men who would have the virtuous women They'd be reproducing Those would be the men who would be controlling the future right women exile liberation is
(1:39:17) fun if you're single." Um a pre independent Aqua says a previous tenant
(1:39:23) to gay rights advocacy group The group said they didn't want gay marriages but this was still their way to fight the
(1:39:29) tax benefits of Christian advocacy groups This was in Canada Canada Um Doug
(1:39:34) MPA says the Wilks brothers fund the Daily Wire Crimson King Blackpill is the
(1:39:40) I'm sorry I am blackpilled I'll own it proceeds to
(1:39:45) state uh the house is on fire and watches it burn down and complain about the water um with a water house hose
(1:39:52) right next to them Well I mean the question is is there a reward for doing
(1:39:57) that and right now I just don't see that there's a reward like if you stop it from crashing and burning what do they
(1:40:02) get they have the building not fall on their head No I meant like for them to help their neighbor's house that's on
(1:40:09) fire Yeah Yeah So I mean like like right now society doesn't reward you for doing like tireless jobs and like like
(1:40:16) stopping everything from crashing and burning So there's no incentive So you definitely get rewarded for doing
(1:40:21) dangerous ass jobs for sure Money Well then why aren't young men doing them because there's other there's Well they
(1:40:28) are doing them Trades are making a huge comeback Like there there's no doubt that that's the case But I meant like younger men are dropping out of the
(1:40:34) workforce and Yeah And for participation Yeah And everybody's asking why And I'm
(1:40:40) saying they're ask it's because they're asking the question what's in it for me i'm not going to get a wife I'm not like
(1:40:45) why do it yeah Well I think it's because they live at home for longer periods of time and don't have to get a job is why
(1:40:51) you see less of them participating That would be the the big coralate I would see But when they are participating
(1:40:56) they're definitely moving towards much more dangerous jobs than they were in the past Well I would No but they're
(1:41:04) staying at home because they don't see an incentive to move out right what's the or they can't afford to move out
(1:41:09) That's a big one Like they they they tend to stay at home like 22 23 24
(1:41:14) because it's really expensive I mean I I talked to younger men on in the Discords
(1:41:20) all the time They're like 21 22 and they're like I'm just putting a bunch of money away so I can move out Yeah Um
(1:41:26) Rachel Rachel Wilson says "Hedenism hedenism gets old quick People want
