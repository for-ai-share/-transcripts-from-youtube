(0:00) I'm just not going to have a man's baby just to have a man's baby if a man wants me to have his baby I have two
(0:05) requirements you're going to get a tattoo of my face on your body cuz it's a body for a body my body's going to change forever your body's going to
(0:11) change forever and my push present is either a car or a house preferably both but I definitely want a tattoo of my
(0:18) face on the father of my child's body preferably stomach cuz my stomach is going to look different after a baby so
(0:23) your stomach should look different too I'm I'm just not going to have a man you can pause it all right so what is a
(0:29) what's a push present it's when you push shoulders through your coochie and you
(0:35) risk your life to bring in another life and you get you get a present gift and a
(0:40) lot of people were saying the baby was the present I don't agree with that I think the baby is a lifelong responsibility and it's also a blessing
(0:47) but it's definitely not a present you think you risk your life pushing out a baby yeah I mean people can do this at
(0:53) home I I plan to do it at home yeah it's not lifethreatening but some people do
(0:58) only for some people it's life threatening have but that's an exception and that's not it's not life-threatening
(1:05) people do it all the time it's not lifeat back in the days women would lose
(1:10) their lives more before more medicine more modern I'm just just curious if you
(1:16) don't mind if I follow up on this um what you say a push present a present is
(1:22) usually something that you give to somebody else right you don't usually get yourself a present so who is this
(1:28) present for the present is for for me from my husband who I'll have my baby
(1:35) by so your husband's giving you the gift of a child um well we're making the child
(1:42) together but I expect a gift after so I well so I don't understand Who's the
(1:48) present for the presents for me so you buy yourself present for himself as well
(1:54) cuz you know happy would you consider it to be a really sad birthday party if you were the only one who showed up to it
(2:00) and you bought your own presents for your birthday party um that just depends in the
(2:06) financial state I'm at and where I'm at at the time I think I don't think a can you give me like um an example any
(2:14) example you could possibly think of of it's your birthday and you're the only one at a party for yourself and you
(2:22) bought the presents for your birthday and then you open your own presents that you bought for yourself can you give me
(2:28) an example of any case where that wouldn't be totally sad and pathetic maybe wrapping it would be a
(2:34) little overboard but I don't think buying yourself gifts for your own birthday is a terrible idea I do it
(2:41) every year yeah but that's just buying yourself something it's not a gift right is it isn't kind of a gift
(2:46) definitionally a thing for somebody else a present is usually something you get for somebody I like I I don't really
(2:53) think that in kind of the common use that when people say the word present they mean uh for me it it usually means
(3:00) for you mhm yeah so I'm just wondering who's the Pres it's not for
(3:07) the father right the present's not for the right it's for you yes so maybe so you just use push present because it
(3:13) just Sounds Clever maybe I didn't make up the term you know it's I'm wouldn't
(3:19) be the first person requesting or receiving a push present yeah push push
(3:24) presents go back like so it's basically what the husband buys the woman
(3:30) something for after birth yeah okay the push present just so we have this the
(3:36) push present you're the present isn't the kid the present is what the husband
(3:42) gives you as a present because you gave birth yes go ahead okay I see so the the
(3:48) baby itself is not the gift yeah the baby is not the gift the baby is not a gift okay so you're getting a
(3:54) gift and you consider that you deserve the gift because you had the baby yes
(4:00) okay so then this means that the you are giving the baby to the man uh the idea would be to raise the
(4:08) child together okay but you just deserve a present well I uh sat and I did the
(4:15) pregnancy I'm the only one that can go through that so yeah I would get the present okay I get I get it now I think
(4:22) I understand do you think you have baby you get a present because you have a
(4:28) baby you said baby yeah you have baby you get present because you have baby
(4:34) yes okay got it is it less meaningful because you're asking for it though no I
(4:40) think it's a good idea to put your expectations on the table so like I want
(4:45) this when I give birth and you're going to be like Yay mhm okay exactly so what if
(4:51) it what are some things that a husband deserves a present for that's a good question I haven't
(4:57) really thought about that but I do love to give I'm not just someone that
(5:03) receives but um I think presents could be given all the time I don't think that there needs to be a special occasion
(5:09) necessarily I think it'd be nice to see something when you're out if it reminds you of someone you get it for
(5:15) them and you want a house yes or a car I think right or a car can it be like a
(5:22) like a pre-owned uh Toyota Civic is that what they're called can it be a tiny
(5:27) home Hond Honda Civic oh my God Jes obviously not a car guy that wouldn't be
(5:32) my preferred like 100k miles I don't think that would be the smartest car to put a baby
(5:38) in okay a Toyota Range Rover is that even a Toyota God what is wrong with me
(5:44) today toy 4Runner you're thinking of four runner 4Runner yeah yeah which one's the Range Rover uh is that the r
(5:50) Rover is no the Range Rover is the brand it's its own brand it's kind of
(5:56) in oh what's it called uh take back my my man card I guess I don't know um I
(6:03) think it was the 100,000 miles that scared me off not necessarily the car um
(6:09) and then the tattoo you want the man should get a tattoo of your face yeah on his belly crazy preferably on the belly
(6:17) yeah like you would would you accept like arm someone has a tattoo of my face on their arm I would I would want the
(6:23) stomach somebody already has a tattoo of your face on their arm really she didn't ask for that no is like a fan or
(6:28) something like a guy you dated mhm the was it the 8ye guy mhm he has a he's he's got a
(6:37) tattoo on your arm he has a tattoo of my face on his arm oh my I'm dyslexic today
(6:43) or something he has a tattoo of your face on his arm yeah when did he how far into the relationship did he get that we
(6:49) were probably together already seven years now did you ask for him to do that or he just did it it was a surprise okay
(6:55) do you have a photo of it on your Instagram anywhere we could find it or I don't or private I don't think I have it that's
(7:02) fine I was just curious um so tattoo of your face on the man's stomach
(7:09) I mean this is uh assuming that the man I would end up with would already have tattoos this is not like if I got with
(7:16) the guy that had no tattoos I would think okay you know sure body for body
(7:21) body for body body for body okay uh just question how many kids do you want to
(7:27) have I would like to adopt but
(7:32) uh donated $200 the best present to give is Hawk Tu
(7:38) Patrice O'Neal said at best men want to be alone but we don't want to be by ourselves ladies remember V comes as a
(7:46) base model you're not special damn okay he's going off there
(7:52) um the best present the Hawk 2 you seen that video Hawk two I've seen the video
(7:58) that's really not what I that doesn't really do it for for
(8:04) the boys this I don't know what why this like obsession with
(8:09) that like is it that hard to like spit on a just to spit anybody can I mean everyone has
(8:16) their own requirements and their own requests yeah you know but it's just like why is everyone going crazy I think
(8:22) it's just funny but it's like anybody can do that [ __ ] anyways um wait so okay
(8:28) you want to I would like kids maybe ad adopt but I would uh like to have two of my own two of your own okay I see if you
(8:37) guys end up having uh Twins or like triplets would he have to get three of
(8:42) your heads like a that's three I think with that if I had twins
(8:50) or triplets hopefully not but I would I'm fine with the one face just I'm
(8:56) probably going to have to get a nicer car a nicer house gotcha oh one question going back so that is a clip from your
(9:02) podcast your podcast is called what something for that ass podcast can you explain I'm what the the title something
(9:09) for that ass it's just like uh you know we have something for that ass we have
(9:15) something for you like you you do like we have something to say like something for that
(9:21) ass for for that ass like is it a specific ass no it's anyone's it's my
(9:27) ass anyone it's the viewer's ass ass I thought it was like something for that ass like that's $1,000 for that ass
(9:36) M more like something for anyone's ass that watches it something and so the content is
(9:44) something and the ass is the the viewer yeah okay all right so I got a quick
(9:51) question for you I wanted to follow up I was thinking about this um I hadn't really heard this idea of a body for a
(9:57) body can I just get a a a point of clarification is the idea behind this
(10:02) that your body is in some way being destroyed and therefore uh you want the
(10:08) other person to make a sacrifice as well with their body because you're making a sacrifice with your own is that is that
(10:15) kind of what the logic is here yes okay so then if you have an abortion what
(10:20) should happen to you if I have an abortion what should happen to me um
(10:25) yeah body for a body right I'm a little confused on the
(10:30) question what should happen to me if I were to get an abortion yeah a body for a
(10:37) body uh well I wouldn't be going through the pregnancy so yeah I know but you
(10:42) know there was another your body would be there was another there was another person who was involved here right and you destroyed that person so what should
(10:51) happen to you body for a body so you're saying if I were to get
(10:57) an abortion and they were to already had gone the tattoo or you're saying just I'm the reason I'm saying why no
(11:04) I'm saying that if you have an abortion you're killing a baby so if you kill a baby right if and the baby has a body
(11:11) and you've destroyed the body what should be the punishment for your body I don't know I guess that's up to
(11:18) God I don't really have an answer why can't why can't it be up to man I mean I
(11:23) I think it could be up to man too right I haven't really thought about that oh you haven't thought about it well I'm
(11:29) just saying following the logic of uh you destroy body therefore they must
(11:34) destroy body on your behalf what if you destroy another body I think in that case wouldn't the logic follow that then
(11:41) something bad should happen to your body what do you think would be
(11:46) appropriate well I don't know but penalty maybe penalty for an abortion um
(11:52) I mean that's your your thoughts and your opin well no I'm just saying logically if it's if it's just well it's
(11:59) not so so the reason the reason you're saying get the tattoo is because that is some kind of Sacrifice from your body
(12:05) that's in some way in your mind equalizing the sacrifice that your body makes but what if the sacrifice is much
(12:11) worse than that it's like almost a human sacrifice level because you've destroyed the entire body of the other individual
(12:18) shouldn't kind of the sacrifice on the other end be equal to that isn't that what the logic is
(12:24) here I think now we're getting into abortion talk I think if you're going to get an abortion you think that's the
(12:30) right thing to do then you're doing what you should think what you think would be best for the baby right yeah what if
(12:35) it's at 9 months what if they get an abortion at 9 months or 8 months then it's clearly a full body right then it's
(12:41) clearly a full body mhm so shouldn't it be some kind of restitution body for
(12:48) body since you now damage the body don't now isn't it I mean isn't it this kind
(12:53) of like eye for an eye is what we're doing here I mean partially but it's also just like if I'm going to be the
(12:59) mother of your child I think you should honor me in some way yeah but I mean what if you're a mother who kills your
(13:05) child what should the honor for you be then I really don't know how to answer
(13:10) that question okay well I was just curious because um it seems like there's kind of
(13:15) a little embedded entailment there right that uh if you want another person to damage themselves because that in some
(13:22) way is a sacrifice which is equal to your own then what if they make the ultimate sacrifice in this case you know
(13:28) they die die because of your decision don't you think that the restitution then should be equal to what it is that
(13:34) you served out since we're doing an i for an ey
(13:39) here I don't personally think so but I'm just more so I believe that the person
(13:47) I'm going to end up with is going to be tatted and he'll do well for himself so I don't think my requests and requirements are that crazy okay men can
(13:55) be um kind of shaped into these behaviors that are damaging towards women and I I don't want to focus too
(14:01) much on the idea of coercion or overlooking soft nose and things like that because I think more of the damage
(14:07) comes from things like lying and manipulating women into and using them for well would be an example of lying or
(14:13) manipulating a woman into sex like if a if a man who worked at McDonald's said he was a lawyer would that be no like
(14:21) giving the it would but okay sure yeah sure um giving the impression that you're interested in having a relationship with somebody can't women
(14:28) do that too yeah but I I think it happens at a much higher frequency from the male side because there's more incentive
(14:34) to if you tie your self worth to how many women you have sex with and you tie yourself worth can I ask you a question
(14:40) sure um do you think so I mean it sounds like there's a cure though like
(14:46) immediately it stands out to me that there's a cure now I understand what you're saying at least I understand your argument you're saying and and I'll just
(14:52) kind of Steal man this to make sure I get it right you're saying listen if Society is saying that men sell forth is
(14:59) much higher based on you know how many women they're having sex with then they have an incentive to have sex with more
(15:05) women thus lie to more women about wanting to have a long-term relationship in order to have sex with them right
(15:12) yeah I would say that's part okay well then wouldn't the argument for this be female Chastity wouldn't that literally cure
(15:18) that problem wouldn't female Chastity literally cure that problem if women
(15:24) waited till they were married to have sex wouldn't that literally cure the problem I don't think necessarily
(15:29) because part of the problem is the way that men view women and that also needs yeah they okay but if they view them as
(15:36) thing I want to have sex with if they're just objectifying them right say I want to have sex with and woman goes well you
(15:42) can't have sex till we're married how's that not the Cure maybe they just want to get married
(15:49) so that they can have sex with the person yeah but I mean but if if that is the case then wouldn't that be vastly
(15:56) more preferable because you're saying they're lying to women about the wanting to have a long-term relationship with
(16:02) them I mean marriage is certainly a long-term commitment I mean I can't think of a
(16:09) more long-term commitment than that sure I don't think it's necessarily preferable though because I think a lot
(16:14) of women are feeling like they are under undervalued and like they are not being appreciated for who they are as a person
(16:19) and only being appreciated for what they have to offer sexually well it seems that if a man's willing to marry them
(16:25) they seem to be appreciated for basically everything but if you're getting what do they say right it's the
(16:30) old say if you're getting the milk for free right if you're getting the milk for free uh then why buy the cow right
(16:37) so the the question becomes if if that is your argument and it does and I did steal man it you said it was male
(16:43) promiscuity they have incentive to Li so they can have access to sex okay that's a high status right got it well if that
(16:52) is the status then it sounds like female Chas would essentially cure this issue I mean I I don't see how it wouldn't I
(16:59) don't think it does because I think part of the problem is that women want to be valued for more than that yeah but they would be being valued
(17:06) for more than that they would be getting married to men right those men would definitely value them or they wouldn't
(17:11) be marrying them right but if they're still just marrying them because they want that status of or the access to a
(17:16) woman I don't think well I'm sorry I'm sorry let's just assume for a second that like only 5% of them marry
(17:22) completely on the condition that that's the only way they can have sexual access wouldn't that still be completely
(17:27) Superior in every way to modernity that you're talking about right now uh I don't think that a 5% I don't
(17:35) think that would be an accurate let's say it's 50% wouldn't that still be superior to the modernity that you're
(17:41) how would it not so sorry in your example or scenario is it like a society where we're not allowed to get divorced
(17:47) or it's just modern society modern society where you're saying there's a plague of men who will lie to women in
(17:53) order to get sexual access it's like okay but if they lie to the woman and say hey I love love you but I'm willing
(17:59) to bury you and take care of you for the rest of your life in order to get access to that sex how is that still not
(18:05) superior to the idea that they could just hump you and dump you I don't like I don't get that like I suppose that's
(18:12) you could say that's superior but how do we get there and why do you think it's just yeah but but that's not really the question of how we get there we first
(18:19) have to establish that that has to be superior to what we now
(18:25) have I'm not committed to an answer on that you're not committed to an answer
(18:30) so you don't you think it would be inferior that if men were marrying women for access to the sex that that would be
(18:36) an inferior system to what we have now or they just lie to him and then bang him and there's no consequences
(18:43) whatsoever I don't see why it would be superior if if well because they would
(18:48) be in this because your your issue is they're lying right so that they can have sex and there's no social
(18:54) repercussions and they're lying about wanting a long-term relationship but if they marry you for the sex they're
(18:59) definitely committing to a long-term relationship okay I okay yeah I see your point with that um yeah okay sure so
(19:07) then I guess so so so then like female chassity which should really be our kind of our number one thing we're looking at
(19:12) here right I think I I still don't necessarily agree oh okay because I
(19:19) think part of the problem is still the fact that women are feeling undervalued and yeah I get that they may still but
(19:25) but you would agree it would be vastly superior right I don't necessarily agree because you
(19:31) you marry somebody who just values you for sex and then you're if that's the only thing and you're still not feeling
(19:36) valued what do you think men value women for do you think what do you think that they're valuing them for like their
(19:42) credit cards what do you think they value women they value women because they want to have sex with them they
(19:48) want them to have their children that's the main value that women have to admit like what what what what do you think
(19:55) the big value is women are bringing to the table after and sex I actually want to know the answer to that question this
(20:02) is such a pointless love and friendship love and friendship you can't you can get friendship from men why do you need
(20:09) friendship from women it's friendship with all these extra benefits sharing
(20:15) your whole life with somebody having a child with them merging World Views sex huh sex I mean so so instead of when
(20:23) you're saying friend the distinction between you being a friend with a guy and and you having a wife is your wife
(20:29) is your friend who you also have sex with it sounds like the value here still seems to be the
(20:35) sex like because you could have all those other conditionals with other people but the sex seems to be the thing
(20:43) you are putting a value emphasis on I disagree and I don't think sex should be the primary value because sex is kind of
(20:50) replaceable I think the the value that you get in a relationship is that merging of a like World Views what do
(20:56) you bring to the table what do I bring bring to the table yeah in a relationship um I think I bring a unique
(21:03) perspective and I can help you live a more fulfilling life and you think you're you think men date you because
(21:09) you bring them a unique perspective yeah I think I have given my partner a unique perspective and I think
(21:14) I I think I've helped him to start living a more fulfilling life and to and I've led him to being a better person
(21:19) doesn't every human being on planet Earth have a unique perspective no no they're not no how
(21:26) could two human beings not have a you unless you're saying all human beings are not unique sure I would say a lot of
(21:32) people have you could say down to the there's some differences between people but I think there's a lot of overlap and
(21:38) shared World Views so you want to be valued so you're one of those um I want
(21:44) to be valued for more than just my sexuality right yeah okay what do you
(21:49) want to be valued for what do you want to be valued for
(21:56) um yeah I guess that's a good question that I don't have I want to be valued for who I am as a person okay but why
(22:04) wouldn't you be valued for who you are as a person and the highest value that the man has with you is still the sex I
(22:09) don't get that I still value you as a person I think you're great I think you're wonderful this and that but the not
(22:15) having sex thing that's a deal breaker that seems reasonable I think I would want to be I
(22:22) don't think I would want sex to be at the top of that list why what I'm valued for would you want like a woman to Value
(22:27) you most for for the money that would I want my woman to Value having sex with me more than anything oh it's terrible
(22:34) oh no what would I do what would I ever do if a woman only valued it's her top priority having sex with me oh who it's
(22:42) terrible how would I ever get through the day she didn't love my big brain and
(22:47) big mind and she only valued sex as her highest priority with I don't know how I could live I don't know maybe that shows
(22:53) that's how you value yourself is what for what you have to offer I have a question for you would you date a guy
(22:59) who uh who lived with his parents yes you would yeah my first boyfriend did he
(23:06) didn't live with the parents yeah you were a little well you're 29 that was when you were 23 sure so you want to
(23:11) have kids one day yeah okay so you'd be totally cool dating a guy who lived with
(23:17) his parents well my prerequisite for having kids cuz I never wanted kids until my current partner was that if
(23:25) we're going to have kids I need to be able to be home and raise the kids cuz I don't want them raised by the system so
(23:32) you want to be a stay-at-home mom I would try to work from home what kind of
(23:38) income you live in don't you live in one of the highest cost of living areas in California you said you're from the bay
(23:44) MH isn't it like we're outside of the bay so it's a little lower but okay well in any case
(23:50) California is still High Cost of Living so and you don't want to be working so
(23:56) your partner has to work correct yeah okay that is that is the requirement if we're to have kids I don't and I don't
(24:03) think that's unreasonable because I think it's important for a mom to raise so then you look to a man to
(24:10) provide sure okay don't you think that in the same the same way you feel about
(24:17) your and I actually think it's a bit of a straw men that men only care about sex but let's just grant it so the same way
(24:25) that you think men think that about women you think that about men you simply look at men as how they can
(24:32) provide for you I don't my partner wants to have children
(24:38) and that was the agreement that we had it's like I'm okay with you would date him you would not date him if he was not
(24:44) able to provide for if he didn't want kids let's say he did he does want kids and that is the condition so there's a
(24:51) condition in order for us to have kids right I wouldn't leave him if he
(24:57) decided like sorry I can't do that what if he still wanted to have kids but he couldn't
(25:02) provide I would say sorry I'm not having kids okay so if men if women are sex
(25:10) objects then men are success
(25:15) objects I am not valuing him on his success it's the practicality reason for raising a child like I don't want to be
(25:22) the kind of person that just has the school system we've been lingering on this for too long would you rather come
(25:27) across a men or a random bear in the woods a bear okay so bear bear bear I'd
(25:35) like to hear the reasons why starting with you um okay so first things first Bears act Bears act strictly off of
(25:43) instinct so usually if they attack they're probably threatened human beings we have the ability to critically and
(25:49) logically think we also tend to have a moral compass so anything a human does is significantly worse I am much more
(25:56) easily going to forgive a bear for call in a human being then I will a man for hitting a
(26:05) woman are more dangerous because we have a moral compass we know
(26:11) it's wrong but people still do it right but this is assuming that in both instances this is doing a comparing a
(26:18) comparison where the man attacks the woman and the bear attacks the woman danger
(26:23) was this is assuming that in all scenarios this woman is going to be attacked again
(26:30) I would rather I would forgive the bear a lot easier than I would forgive the human what does that have anything to do
(26:37) with making a risk assessment of which one is more likely to attack you cuz
(26:43) that is essentially what this question begs I guess I don't know you're in the forest hold on let me get everybody's
(26:50) justification before I give my take so uh why bear I don't know you're in the forest and like people can behave is
(26:59) that's a setting or am I wrong so I think I don't know yes you are in the
(27:04) forest okay but I'm confused whatever I would I'm assuming i' wouldn't see a
(27:10) bear in my house or anything like that like I don't know like if it's more secluded then I would probably buy the
(27:17) bear more I don't know does that I don't know well so for going to make considerations
(27:23) if we're making considerations for where we're going to see the bear who are the type of men you're generally going to see in the forest dudes who are just
(27:30) going camping kind of like want to ignore Society like they're kind of just chill guys doing bro stuff like if
(27:38) you're going to run across a guy in the forest it's probably going to be a dude that's kind of just a normal guy so if
(27:44) we're going to make those considerations for the bear we should make those considerations for the guys why the
(27:51) bear for the past 2 months I already had my weird creepy not good things with men
(27:58) and i' rather trust the Bear right now men okay so you had bad personal experiences in your own life yes air go
(28:07) you'd rather be in a forest alone with a bear versus a man mhm yes okay Brian I've actually changed my
(28:14) opinion on this does that what's your opinion my opinion is I I I totally side with the bear now because I I will tell
(28:23) you why all right let's he go the bear is satisfied with a good meal the woman gets to accurately play the victim and
(28:30) the man has no uh there's no ill will on his side nothing happened he's he's not
(28:35) blamed for any of it I'd rather be food everyone wins everyone wins okay so there's a flaw in your logic okay I'd
(28:42) rather be I'll tell you the flaw okay the flaw is is that after all of the
(28:48) bitching whining and screaming from this woman who was mauled by a bear D her own stupidity some man's going to have to go
(28:55) out there and put the Bear Down fair you're right Andrew but the bear already got me so I just spent the last like 4
(29:01) days up in Keem Canyon in seoa and uh yes I was hiking out with bears and I
(29:06) was at a river and I went swimming and there was a bear like 50 yards away it was a mom with her cub they left me
(29:12) alone I left them alone I went swimming in the river I took a nap on a rock I woke up and they were gone but when you
(29:18) see a man on the trail you go like you completely ignore them and Dodge them okay so hold on so let's just
(29:25) say you did that right did the man chase you down and then attack you no but you you tend
(29:30) to but so you did you took an action like you took an action but it doesn't
(29:36) mean that like nothing happened yeah you ignored him like but the point is that
(29:41) you don't know what that person's thinking right when you sit there and you pass the bear in the woods but the bear is more predictable no you pass the
(29:48) bear in the woods the bear is predictable because it acts off of instinct humans can sit there and they can pass you and then they can come behind you and like pop you in the head
(29:54) or whatever [ __ ] well then let me uh let me ask you a question just to because you can predict bare behavior and you're
(30:01) obviously very skilled at the prediction of bare Behavior if you were to do you think walk up to 50 random men and Pat
(30:08) them on the head or 50 random bears and Pat them on the head which one do you think would be more likely toing Maul
(30:15) you to death the bear that makes it predictable hold on that's a completely different situation it's not in its
(30:20) natural habitat what do you mean it's you can do it in their natural habitat you walk right over and you just go and
(30:27) Pat it on it head I'm gonna Dodge both the bear and the man the man's in his
(30:32) natural is that human beings are more dangerous than Bears okay so let's try this again you
(30:39) didn't you would agree you would agree that men are in their natural habitat if you find one in a city or you find one
(30:46) in the country they're in their natural habitat and if you walked over and you were to Pat just random men on the head
(30:53) versus random Bears on the head which one do you think would be more likely to viciously attack you and kill you
(31:01) probably the bear but that's why you that's why you don't be stupid cuz you
(31:06) know it would be pretty stupid to take a gamble with a bear you seem like he'd be
(31:12) far more comfortable patting random men touching random men without their permission seems to be well within your
(31:18) comfort level as opposed to touching random Bears comfortability and predictability is different you bother a
(31:24) bear the way you bother men no yeah I get I get where you're going with this
(31:29) but it's more about like I think you're trying to say that that they're just more predictable that's yes I'm saying
(31:38) because because any animal acts off of instinct it's easy to predict their next move human being you can't predict their
(31:45) next move not just men I wouldn't even say that about just men but predict the
(31:51) moves of a wild bear really no yeah that's I mean I'm an Outdoorsman as well
(31:56) I'm a Hunter I spend a lot of time outdoors I got to push back on this a little bit so so like they can
(32:03) manipulate you into thinking that they might eat you and then they won't or bears are very simple yeah you're right
(32:08) they are simple it is either I'm going to kill you I'm going to eliminate this new threat or I'm going to go away those
(32:15) are the only two options with a man there are a million options and only a few of them are bad most of them are
(32:22) like hey I'm going to say hi to you or I'm going to ignore you most most of them and you probably won't even see the
(32:29) guy that's absolutely fair and I agree with that there are far less negative outcomes with the man than there are the
(32:35) negative but far less negative or are you going to go for I know for sure more
(32:42) what the bear is going to do yeah I know for sure that the bear is either going to avoid me or murder me I'm not willing
(32:48) to take that chance I'm I'm much more likely to take the chance with the guy
(32:53) because there are more options than ignore me or murder me ser Killers get away I would take that gamble any day
(33:00) torture you generally speaking that's probably not going to happen but with a bear it
(33:06) is one of two options and he just might be hungry the bear if it's hungry enough it's like hey that thing's smaller than
(33:13) me I'm going to kill it and eat it I think these answers come from from think that way it is am I hungry that they
(33:20) don't have too many I have never ran across an aggressive bear and I've been around a lot of bears from the appalache
(33:27) to up north
(33:32) californ yeah fing right what bears have you been around in the Appalachia what
(33:38) bears the on what bears were you running into in the Appalachia there are a lot of bears in Tennessee what
(33:44) kind they're black bears how many bears and what other kinds of bears are there
(33:49) how many bears have you come across yeah how many bears bears have you I am I am
(33:55) in the woods a lot okay literally literally dozens like you cross paths yes I literally have a selfie with me
(34:01) and a bear in the back okay and then how many men have you walked past too many
(34:08) millions okay wait wait wait wait why do you say why do you say it like that hold on hold on let her answer why
(34:14) antisocial oh you're not anti-men no I no I hate everybody
(34:20) equally okay so how many men do you think you've just walked past without incidents Millions few maybe not
(34:27) Millions hundreds of thousands tens of thousands throughout the whole course of your life think High School yeah but a
(34:33) bear a bear has never h me at the mall at the restaurant yes perhaps I'm not
(34:40) doubting that a man or some men in your life have hurt you that's probably where
(34:45) that answer really comes from but how many let me ask you a question how many hours of your life have you been in
(34:52) proximity to men as compared to proximity to bears like would you say would you say it's you've been in
(34:58) proximity to bears for less than an hour of your life no I would say more than an
(35:03) hour it's probably on the order you said you said a couple dozen so you're just kicking it with bears for
(35:10) like 30 minutes you're just chilling sometimes you just sit there and you watch the bear and you're just like okay
(35:15) cool if we're shocking it down to just like a a comparison to a bear then obviously yeah like this this is kind of
(35:22) like ridiculous but the answers that are coming from
(35:27) like it bear being more likely to us be wanted to be interact with than a man is
(35:35) coming from other situations that are a little bit more deeper than my point is that human beings are
(35:42) more dangerous than Bears I'm just trying not to say things I'm not allowed to either at the same time so yeah I'm
(35:49) not saying that human beings are less capable of inflicting harm they are more capable inflicting harm but on average
(35:55) men are not going to inflict harm unnecessarily compared to bears bears
(36:01) don't care they're just going to do what they want to do regardless there are less there are less walls they have to
(36:06) go over morals their Humanity uh like is this other person posing a threat all of
(36:12) those walls have to be crossed by a man but for a bear to want to Maul you it's like one or two it's like feel that's
(36:19) why I say it's significantly easier to forgive a bear than it is well it's not about it's like it's likelihood of being
(36:26) harmed well yeah that's would still pick the bear I would rather be moulded by a bear than hurt by this whole like it's
(36:33) all I'm actually okay with that it's all it's just fine I don't know have you ever seen a woman I I mean who cares
(36:40) have you ever seen a woman's reaction to a spider and y'all going to pick bear I
(36:47) love spiders okay what's up what you got can I add a little follow-up question to the bear talk keeping on the subject of
(36:53) bear talk and I want everyone to answer real quickly you're walking through a forest part two of the question you're
(36:58) walking through a forest and you can see one of the three following things what do you pick a man a bear or a woman
(37:05) which one do you pick a man still probably the bear still
(37:11) man no it's solely just I don't think there's any right or wrong answer I'm just asking out of curiosity a woman no
(37:17) I don't know I would choose a man because a woman can't help me yeah I I would I would trust in a man more than I
(37:24) would trust in a woman th% okay damn I'm a firm believer if you can't uh get out
(37:30) of the woods by yourself you don't deserve to get out of the woods it's not really the question but fair enough I
(37:36) mean you talking about they're talking about a man helping them that's how I view it yeah if I was
(37:41) in the woods how how I kind of view it is that wait wait wait are you one of
(37:46) those people who would be able to get out of the woods yourself yeah I just spent the last four days in the woods all right great can you tell me how you
(37:52) make a fire in the woods yeah you have a spark thing yeah no you don't have
(37:58) anything you just have your bare hands how would you make a fire the stick with the little what what does that mean I
(38:05) don't know what that means walk me just walk me through how you would make a fire in the woods you rub the sticks
(38:10) together dude with the little bit of you rub two sticks together and then what happens when you rub two sticks together
(38:16) friction happens and then it creates heat and then heat creates fire well I mean that's true but you would have to
(38:21) combust something right yes yeah so why don't you walk me through without being
(38:26) snarky walk me through how you would start a fire in the woods time to start a fire have to do with anything it
(38:33) follows what does you why why I I don't understand you're one of the guy you're going to make it you're the person who's
(38:39) going to make it out of these Woods you are a Savage sheir broad now tell me how
(38:45) you make a fire in the woods when you don't have anything to make a fire with tell me carry a
(38:50) lighter you don't have a lighter I don't know why you don't have a lighter but I'm very prepared when I go in the woods
(38:56) why don't you engage question I don't feel like answering this question you can't answer the question right no
(39:01) because I already answered it but you would be one of the ones who got out of the woods right yes no I would die in wait why don't you feel like answering
(39:08) the question I just answered the question I told you friction friction creates heat he creates fire yeah but he
(39:14) was looking no no that's just an oversimplification walk me through how
(39:19) you would do it I'm good but just take the L and say
(39:25) you don't know okay fine I don't know you don't so okay do you actually don't know though I
(39:33) do know I don't you got can you into the mic I do not feel like having this conversation right now you hold on
(39:38) you're triggered over the making fire conversation that's where you draw the line on making fire yes I draw the line
(39:44) at making fire I will not make fire I will die in the woods cold and alone happy well why okay why don't you just
(39:50) engage in good faith like I don't I don't get it I mean it's it's kind of funny to me that I
(39:57) mean you were so into the conversation 5 seconds ago and then suddenly I don't want to answer any questions very
(40:06) strange in fact hold on in your pre-show notes you said you're incorrect about
(40:12) the be debate and if it is still a topic of conversation when I come on the show I would love to come on and tell you
(40:18) you're wrong if you would have me again yeah so you can't just shut down the conversation but this has actually I
(40:24) brought up theate I brought up the debate precisely because I already told you I prefer to pick the bear and I said
(40:31) I'm a firm believer if you can't make it out alive by yourself then you don't deserve to make it out of life but you
(40:36) also said you would be one of the ones who did okay then I won't I'll die in the woods that you wouldn't be one of
(40:42) the ones who would make it out of w no I won't Jesus but you're holding yourself out to be some like survivalist and he's
(40:49) asking you a basic survival question I'm a survivalist I just hike in the woods for days at a
(40:55) time okay
(41:00) okay well she doesn't want to answer the fire question there's not really anything we can take two sticks and you
(41:07) rub them together rub them together your man you're not her man I didn't need to
(41:13) and when you show me a man I mean you know I I don't even know what you just
(41:19) said I said when you show me a man then she can like up I don't think like I
(41:25) don't see one so why would I take the advice of a woman who has a paper clip in her nose it's not a paperclip so
(41:31) there you go what is it it's an industrial bar so it's actually made to be like thank you oh I mean my bad what
(41:38) was I thinking yeah mind your business how about that yeah I know what was I think I mean you're the one who
(41:43) addressed me not me who addressed you but if I fire back you have 20 pieces of Steel in your
(41:50) face and I'm supposed to take it's better than looking like a big mouth
(41:56) character yeah yeah but Andrew doesn't matter what we look like supposed to take what you say
(42:02) serious are you coming after African tribes because I know a lot of African tribes that do have like a lot of yeah
(42:08) name a single African tribe by name one you do it the you do
(42:14) it single African tribe no BL answer name a single a I
(42:22) have to name one one for what reason why do I have to name something you just
(42:27) said I know tons of African why do I have to name something that's a part of my heritage why while
(42:32) you're coming my Heritage name of an African stupid you
(42:38) look as stupid as you sound honestly are you going to name a tribe I don't have to cuz you can't you and I don't have to
(42:46) wait imagine saying this is an intricate part of I me you act like the fact that like even fat people with hair don't
(42:52) even actually exist in other [ __ ] societies and that they have like so just name one you don't have to name it
(42:59) to know that it exists you want me to go grab my phone I can go grab my phone and tell you right now oh you'd have to look
(43:06) it up it's so your gra my phone and tell you right now I am storing so much information in my head it doesn't matter
(43:12) what if I remember well let me ask you a question do you know what a burrito is
(43:17) of course we know what a burrito is yeah great uh you know that there's a maybe a
(43:22) part of a cultural heritage that a burrito is a part of what would that cultural heritage be if okay and there's
(43:29) other foods that exist that I can't even name do matter that if I know whether the name burit a burrito though would
(43:37) associate with and it doesn't matter it so a burrito ites matter a burrito
(43:43) you it doesn't matter and it doesn't matter SP going to answer a single matter CU I don't have to yeah so and I
(43:52) don't have you already sound [ __ ] stupid you sound like because I can't name something doesn't
(43:59) exist but it exists and it doesn't matter if I yeah but it's important to
(44:05) doesn't want your answer because he wants us to Dick ride and sound stupid he doesn't want you to help me he just
(44:10) needs sex I don't think she was saying her piercings are because of her Heritage I I think she was just saying
(44:16) that I didn't say that she said this is an intricate part of my Heritage because the African tribes I asked your name on
(44:22) I said that there's a lot of African tribes that do have a lot of piercings you are doesn't matter if I have to name
(44:28) one did the azte exist for you to say like oh that there's like pyramids out
(44:34) in Mexico like shut the up who built those who built those huh who built the
(44:41) pyramids which one anything why would I take you seriously why would I take a person who
(44:48) said s answer me that question answer a question how about answer me a question about how are you slowy you want to get
(44:54) into aliens Winker well about who really built the pyramids like aliens right here [ __ ]
(45:00) like you it's just it's just Madness to me that this is so the cultural heritage you don't know
(45:08) because you can't name something specifically that it doesn't exist something specifically that what
(45:14) doesn't exist oh my God are you that slow the conversation that we were having this whole entire time what was I
(45:21) saying this whole entire time I would just like to know what you said what you said was there's a cultural heritage
(45:28) face jewelry hang on let me finish that's why you have the Jew you finish you ask me a question do you not
(45:34) want the answer Libby Libby I'm so sorry about oh yeah don't worry about it that's why I
(45:42) didn't you were disruptive towards her and now you're asking for the same respect is ridiculous you going
(45:47) answering that's ridiculous okay so I mean you can keep that argument to yourself on trying to make people sound
(45:53) stupid but at the end of the day you sound [ __ ] stupid the more that you trying to say that it doesn't exist
(46:00) because I can't name a single like tribe or Society or blah blah blah I have seen
(46:07) the pictures I know that they exist just like you know like move on past it we

(47:08) piercings I'll correct the record your piercings were be due to an African Heritage which you had a deep connection
(47:14) to because of African tribes I said it's a part of my Heritage cuz am I not Afric you can't name a sing not African just
(47:22) because I don't my skepticism when you can't name sing

(53:53) [ __ ] like come on you I mean it's just it's just Madness to me that this is so
(53:59) important to you the cultural heritage that you don't know anything about you can't name something specifically that
(54:04) it doesn't exist something specifically that what doesn't exist oh my God are you that
(54:10) slow or the conversation that we were having this whole entire time what was I saying this whole entire time I would

(54:36) why you were disruptive towards her now you're asking for the same respect is ridiculous you answer that's ridiculous
(54:43) okay so I mean you can keep that argument to yourself on trying to make people sound stupid but at the end of
(54:48) the day you sound [ __ ] stupid the more that you trying to say that it doesn't exist because I can't name a
(54:56) single like tribe or Society or blah blah blah I have seen the pictures I know that they exist just like you know
(55:04) like move on past it we all like so I just listen say that Drake we
(55:10) know that Drake talked to kids but like just because we don't have like everything right here and I can't tell
(55:16) you all the [ __ ] kids that he was talking to doesn't mean that doesn't exist so so anyway so what you said was
(55:22) you said that all of the face piercings in the wig were because we' had nothing to do with this so now you're you're

(55:54) didn't include my wig so you coming after my wig whenever I was talking about my piercings oh try it again so just your
(56:02) piercings I'll correct the record your piercings were be due to an African Heritage which you had a deep connection
(56:08) to because of African tribes I said it's a part of my Heritage cuz am I not African you can't name a sing afrian
(56:16) because I don't my skepticism when you can't name the story of slavery so
(56:22) important to you are you stupid do you know the story of slavery and how a lot slaves don't even know their own tries
(56:28) still sping do you know the story of slavery and how they don't know their own like done
(56:35) sping I have to go are you done sping now so that I can going to answer the
(56:40) question because it sounds stupid to me that you're going to try to tell me about how I don't know so like my
(56:47) Heritage and blah blah blah whenever we all know and it's basic common knowledge that black people in America who didn't
(56:54) come directly from who their were brought here that we don't know our
(57:01) tribes and blah blah blah but I do know in fact that there are tribes out there
(57:06) to you but you don't know a single tribe got it why are you acting like that information is so readily available I'm
(57:11) going to listen a Nick from Big Mouth like shut wait it's not readily available African tribes are not readily
(57:19) available you're taking it in that way some weirdo
(57:28) yeah okay shut up like it doesn't seem like it's very important to
(57:33) you everybody put your swords away for just a minute yeah ENT like actually
(57:40) finish without being filibuster what she said what she said was this gear exact where SE she's still
(57:47) filibustering what she said was the massive amount of face wear that I have
(57:53) is due to my deep cultural African connections to my tribes and then when I
(57:59) asked her what tribe she can't name a single African tribe not okay that's
(58:04) like asking me to name every woman every woman to exist now
(58:12) Lally because like like you know just trolling you one second all right guys
(58:17) check this out check it out look I got to move it on I got to move it on listen it was good it was entertaining a little
(58:23) heated exchange it was very it was good that was the most that was the it was the most you said all night I love it it
(58:28) was great thank you it was good I'm glad we got I'm glad we got to see a different side of you and you know I
(58:36) personally think Desmond's at half trou right now just kid I'm kidding I'm kidding Desmond
(58:42) oh sorry oh was that Karen sorry
(58:48) sorry uh hi that super uh which one I don't see it anyways um guys I'm going
(58:54) to yeah we're just going to hide that one Nick um okay so it is other people's responsibility to make you feel
(59:00) emotionally safe I say when there is not full disclosure of
(59:06) the plan of what's going to be done to me psychologically then that is the
(59:12) responsibility of the person who's manipulating me it's really funny that you say that because this actually is
(59:18) just deterring responsibility to the second party right so you're saying yes you guys are more powerful than I am as
(59:25) far as damaging me psychologically because we live in a society that has
(59:30) normalized the manipulation of women and their vulnerability emotionally so I
(59:37) believe that you partook in that same essentially tactic of getting from me
(59:43) what you wanted yeah so so I'm going to just like Grant a couple things right uh
(59:49) thing one I have to go to the bathroom first and then when I come back you can share okay how many shots did you guys
(59:55) have you have one shot this is my third shot maybe don't maybe the alcohol is
(1:00:00) not a good idea well if you guys were nice I wouldn't need it if if we were nice she
(1:00:07) wouldn't need we've been nice I think you guys are nice we've been
(1:00:14) nice I would rather you just say exactly what I I I I was just about to tell you
(1:00:19) exactly what I thought but then you had to pee I did we we're going to I've had a lot of children we we will get in
(1:00:26) future episodes funnels onto the table for people to so they don't have to get
(1:00:31) so yeah I mean I was just about to to Grant to you uh yeah I don't care about how what I say makes a person
(1:00:38) emotionally feel if uh the purpose of the discussion is a disagreement how
(1:00:45) your like your emotional state from there is totally irrelevant to me do you know that that's a a
(1:00:52) symptom of what psychopathy psychopathy doesn't exist it it does it
(1:01:00) doesn't it's the lack of empathy for another's feelings okay so you're a psychologist right yes okay do you think
(1:01:07) that psychopathy is actually a medical psychological condition and that you can
(1:01:13) identify it in the DSM yes they can now brain scan you and tell if you have psychopy you have your phone yes okay
(1:01:20) can you pull up the DSM 5 and show me where it says anything about psychopathy I'm not talking about the dsm5 I'm
(1:01:26) talking about well then how do you categorize what is a psychological condition you can get a brain scan and your gray matter would show up
(1:01:32) differently than somebody without psychop that first of all when you're talking about brain scans that's a really brand new tech that's the same
(1:01:38) thing as when people say that you can do a brain scan to determine a gender you really can't because you have human
(1:01:44) variances in sexuality the gender is is determined more by the hormonal makeup matter cannot determine if somebody is a
(1:01:50) psychopath but even if it could psychopathy in and of itself has not even been demonstrated to be harm ful to
(1:01:57) society psychopathy in and of itself could be a boon to Society for instance you may need people who have completely
(1:02:04) unfeeling dispositions for certain jobs which need doing I agree because we are all tools
(1:02:11) essentially of the Divine well I mean God in your ideology you would call it
(1:02:16) God yeah I would say that we're all we're all definitely in ag there's where our Vin diagrams are
(1:02:23) crossing I believe we are all tools ask is just because I don't care what your emotional state is when we're having a
(1:02:29) discussion about something we disagree on I don't understand why that would even indicate psychopathy it's very
(1:02:35) common for stoic men to not care about the emotional status of a person who refuses tohere to very common of men to
(1:02:42) be offive it doesn't mean it's right yeah but you're now you're conflating two different things so I
(1:02:48) would agree psychopath Psychopathic individuals are abusive yeah but not all
(1:02:54) abusive people are psychopaths true that's true some of them are narcissistic yeah but not all people are
(1:02:59) narcissists some of them are just trauma responding and they overreact all them are doing that either yeah abuse name
(1:03:05) name a type of AB from you is so broad that encompasses everything encompasses
(1:03:12) emotionaly it's the degradation it's the calculated degradation of another
(1:03:18) individual without remorse feeling or care it's not a trauma response in other
(1:03:23) words now what you saw of me in the last show was me trauma responding so I did hurt people's feelings and I said things
(1:03:30) that were you could say you could say but I really was I have very complex
(1:03:37) traumas MH I could spend yeah but isn't it a lot of time telling you but isn't
(1:03:42) it awful convenient to say when I do it it's excused when you do it it's because you're a psychopath
(1:03:49) well to be honest with you you're a predator I'm not well you're not a
(1:03:55) predator no what what makes me predatory and you not predatory I don't go out
(1:04:00) seeking to hurt people you do who do I go out to seek to hurt me how did I seek to hurt you you are seeking to show the
(1:04:09) followers that I am basically not worth living not worth speaking not worth
(1:04:15) breathing not worth having an opinion my opinion well if your opinion is bad then
(1:04:20) yes that your opinion so look at TRC try toose yourself put yourself in
(1:04:27) my shoes for a second okay let us assume for a second that I had some knowledge
(1:04:32) some something I was raised by your typ assume for a second well they didn't they didn't raise you right but assume
(1:04:37) for a second I just diverted to something else okay so anyway back to this real quick I was I was in the
(1:04:43) middle of talking awful of you to cut me off while I'm speaking I'm speaking I'm just giving you back your own medicine
(1:04:49) I'm speaking I'm giving you back your own medicine I don't I don't respect you I'm speaking I don't respect you I'm
(1:04:55) speaking I don't respect your thought process so anyway I literally don't respect your thought proc who cares what you respect who cares what you respect I
(1:05:02) mean do you want why should I care about you if you don't give a [ __ ] about me I don't give a [ __ ] about you cut in we're
(1:05:07) yes if you don't give a [ __ ] about me I'm going to show you what it feels like to have somebody not give a [ __ ] about you but I'm not going to Gaslight you
(1:05:14) and pretend like I give a I'm just going to tell you I don't give a your so then there's a difference between I don't give about you you're a piece of you're
(1:05:21) only here because your sex life Su actually do you want to do you want to go there you're only here because you
(1:05:27) children okay I thought we weren't going to talk about that I thought but hang on you can dish it out but you can't take
(1:05:33) it I gave you explicit boundaries that you were I just broke your boundaries cuz I don't give a cuz I don't give a
(1:05:40) you didn't give me boundaries get your wife on the phone what would you like to talk to her about
(1:05:46) I would like to ask her how the sex is okay wait wait that's come on let's I
(1:05:52) really would look we got I can't I was married to your we can call my ex-husband if you
(1:05:58) want he might answer you never know you two would get along you'd be besties he's a real winner by the way look if I
(1:06:05) mean he probably is he divorced you right no I divorced him oh well that mean that actually makes more sense so
(1:06:11) look if if you want Andrew to respect the boundaries you can't be slinging the
(1:06:16) here's the thing Brian he didn't give me boundaries he didn't give me I gave him boundaries he did not say you can't do
(1:06:23) this you can't do that said respons for my emtional health we can put the no button in the middle and you can use it
(1:06:30) too if you would like do you need boundaries too and consent you need a safe word it's no put it there so here's
(1:06:36) the boundary now you feel safe you can say no whenever you want okay when I when I hit the no that means stop
(1:06:42) talking okay agree okay do you think you can do that
(1:06:48) can I show my ass on camera every time you say no no no we on that because that would violate the terms of service
(1:06:56) what's the terms of service that I can't you can't show your ass on camera I never signed anything that said I couldn't so you're going to break the
(1:07:02) TOs what's the TOs Nick just intro if you have to what is it it means we're on
(1:07:07) YouTube and twitch you can't show you guys I'm old I don't know what these things are you know what YouTube is I
(1:07:13) don't know the rules do I seem like I follow rules okay but would you it's if
(1:07:19) you don't seem like you're even rational or coherent Al I'm not rational to um m
(1:07:25) mream Society I'm not I'm a Divergent obviously you can be Divergent and be
(1:07:30) rational no not necessarily no not these days no you can't no you literally can't
(1:07:35) yeah you literally can do you like TR literally what lit means it literally doesn't mean what you literally are you
(1:07:40) supporting Trump I'm asking you a question yes look at you course okay look it
(1:07:46) there's an area our um V diagram intersect so what does that have to do with the price of tea in
(1:07:52) China let's say okay let's just pretend okay Trump was my dad uh-huh let's just
(1:07:58) pretend yeah would you give me a little more respect no none no I I would treat
(1:08:05) you exactly um how you treat you I usually match People's Energy so if they're being they're being lunatic
(1:08:11) asshol and I'm a lunatic [ __ ] same high five no you so just so you know
(1:08:18) yeah I don't want to touch you don't want to touch you but but here's the thing right no no no don't do it don't touch me don't don't
(1:08:25) how do you think men treat women who they think they are settling for do they treat them well or do they tend to treat
(1:08:31) them poorly poorly poorly yeah poorly poorly
(1:08:39) mhm do you have an answer I uh it's so tough cuz we're talking
(1:08:45) strictly based on looks and it's like relationships yeah there's more to it than that you know like if if you're mid
(1:08:53) my consideration I mean if we're if we're so looks and then that's fine we talking about
(1:08:58) that um I don't know I think they treat them similar to how they treat themselves well I mean we
(1:09:05) have a woman here who said her treatment totally changed when she became more physically attractive she used to weigh
(1:09:12) more she now weighs less the treatment has totally changed mhm and
(1:09:18) so taking her anecdotal example here I would say this equally applies to women
(1:09:24) women treat men who they're more attracted to better than they treat men who they're less
(1:09:30) attracted to I think that's just a subconscious thing right but if as a
(1:09:35) woman but let me ask you a question if you think you're more attractive than you actually are how are you going to
(1:09:43) treat the men who are actually in your league you're going to just outright
(1:09:50) reject them you're going to ignore them or if you do end up in a relationship with them you're going to view it as set
(1:09:55) and invariably you're not going to treat them very well not not in all instances of course I'm not saying all women are
(1:10:02) inclined to treat people uh worse off but it occurs to me that we do tend to treat people uh differently based on our
(1:10:11) sense of how attractive they are if you settle for somebody you might do less for them
(1:10:17) you might not treat them as well sure that's fair I think a lot of it for girls too is like a lot of attrac I know
(1:10:24) we're talking so based off looks but a lot of attractiveness is from personality I've seen guys that I like
(1:10:30) know that before I get to know them I can be like they're not very cute they're not that good-looking but once you get to know them in their
(1:10:35) personality it can completely change and I'm notoriously known to go for guys that the rest of my friends don't find
(1:10:41) very attractive that's solely because of their personality and how they hold
(1:10:48) themselves or wait are you asking or no yeah so were they still 63 but they weren't good-look but their personality
(1:10:55) I mean I thought you only dated 61 and above my height and above so like yeah
(1:11:01) almost 61 yeah yeah I mean Height's a big thing but I think that their
(1:11:10) personalities are more like the thing that gets them across from me if a guy's funny and like hold himself with confidence and stuff it goes way are all
(1:11:17) men funny and what what percentage of men do you think are funny and what percentage of men hold themselves with
(1:11:23) confidence or have charisma probably pretty high amount but I think there's a fine line between confidence and
(1:11:29) Charisma and like ego sure these are all different things but yeah
(1:11:35) uh I I would say that oh sorry go ahead well I mean I was just going to say I I
(1:11:40) agree that men can make up for deficiencies by having uh outstanding
(1:11:46) personality uh humor Etc they can make up for it um I still think some
(1:11:53) component of physical tract of this needs to be there yeah but yes sure if
(1:12:00) they can but what if a guy doesn't have those things doesn't
(1:12:06) have the physical traits no he doesn't have the humor or the Charisma or the
(1:12:11) personality it's probably a no gu I I find that when people don't hold
(1:12:16) themselves in confident ways don't have the Charisma don't they become less attractive to me okay even if they're
(1:12:23) like a 10 out of 10 there's just something about them that will always be less attractive to me the way you think really matters yeah there was a guy that
(1:12:30) I was talking to he had a eight pack beautiful but he was a liberal and I was
(1:12:35) just like I can't do it just the way that he the the things that he would say I just couldn't do it you did he I'm
(1:12:42) telling you he was sexy his biceps were insane but he was just stupid not big it it really does matter
(1:12:48) my first boyfriend he actually was ugly he was not attractive people tell him all the time how the hell were you able to get Kwan he it's my personality and
(1:12:54) it's true yeah he was a conservative no I was I was like 17 oh he's in prison
(1:13:03) now I didn't really choose the best guy the first time around dodged a bullet so I guess I mean I guess going back to my
(1:13:09) point so if if women tend to have a delusional and inflated sense of self uh
(1:13:15) as it comes to their physical attractiveness they'll rate themselves higher than they actually are they rate
(1:13:21) men lower than what those men actually are I mean how how is this just not a recipe for disaster where women will
(1:13:28) just be perpetually chasing after men who are out of their league and rejecting the men who are in their
(1:13:33) league so I mean that's why I think this rating question is important frankly I
(1:13:40) think most women are trying to date well above what their looks prospects and personalities
(1:13:49) warrant I say some women not all I agree I especially think the ISS of
(1:13:55) women chasing men is rampant right now I don't know if I entirely see the correlation between it being because
(1:14:02) they rate themselves more highly and tend to avoid men who you say are in their league but I definitely think that
(1:14:09) it's a problem when women demean themselves to the point of chasing a man
(1:14:14) whether they recognize they're doing it or not well I think that the script has slowly been getting flipped with Gen Z
(1:14:22) so the the idea of egal Ian ISM the movement towards were just interchangeable widgets which has become
(1:14:29) socialized in society it seems to be rejected pretty heavily by a huge subset of genz a bunch
(1:14:36) of them embrace it don't get me wrong but a larger subset of them say no than you would ever
(1:14:41) imagin and so they seem to look at this and go ah you know if uh if you really
(1:14:48) think we're equal and you really think that you're awesome and pay you could pay for the dates and you could off and
(1:14:55) that it seems to kind of reverse the script right now the women kind of have to chase them and it's like H you know
(1:15:01) we don't we don't really want to get involved if uh if this is going to be a lot of work and a pain in the ass and
(1:15:06) this type of thing and um there's a there seems to be a much larger subset of that now than there there was
(1:15:15) definitely for Millennials just one point of uh clarification Gracie when I say chasing I don't mean that they're
(1:15:22) necessarily like doing the proactive thing that men do to get women although they are but uh so when I say chasing I
(1:15:32) just mean like the men that they want to be with so the man could still be taking initiative uh because men will shoot
(1:15:38) their shots with women below their league um but the women will view this
(1:15:45) purely sexual interest and think that this is somehow equating to like long-term romantic
(1:15:53) interest and uh so a really attractive guy might pursue a woman
(1:15:59) who's less good-looking than him doesn't mean that she'll ever get commitment or
(1:16:04) anything like that that's why women often complain about boys and the like um because there's just a differential
(1:16:12) there and you typically it does happen to men but you typically don't hear men
(1:16:19) complaining about well I slept with her once and then
(1:16:25) I mean look there's some there's some women who do this but I slept with her once I wanted more but she
(1:16:33) didn't some women do this but it's not a common complaint uh among men and the
(1:16:40) differential is so as a man if we can sleep with a woman there's a very high
(1:16:46) likelihood we can get her in a relationship it's not clear to me if the reverse is the same it's not clear to me
(1:16:53) if if a woman just because you can sleep with a guy that you can for with
(1:16:58) certainty get him into a relationship if that's your
(1:17:05) goal I'm just doesn't that make sense though based on what you just explained so like a
(1:17:10) [Music] guy like did I hear this right so a guy sleeps with a girl but and think and
(1:17:16) thinks he could get her in a relationship is that what it is but then it's not the same yeah like as as men if
(1:17:23) we can sleep with you if we want a relationship there's a pretty good chance we can get that girl
(1:17:29) in a relationship right it's not clear to me if a girl sleeps with a guy that
(1:17:36) she can in all instances get the guy in a
(1:17:41) relationship I think that's fair it's true because I here's one of the reasons
(1:17:46) so in order for us men in order for us to sleep with a girl typically from the girl's perspective from the woman's
(1:17:52) perspective we have to be at least attractive enough to be in a
(1:17:58) relationship with you so if you have and it goes sort of very opposite ways
(1:18:05) so for you to sleep with a guy even if it's casual you'll typically want the guy to be like you'll go out of your way
(1:18:13) to find like a super attractive guy to do that yeah it's a fly cool
(1:18:20) um whereas when it comes to women or excuse me when it comes to men
(1:18:26) we'll sleep with a girl who just on the basis of her looks alone we just want to have sex whatever she'll never get
(1:18:33) commitment she'll never get a relationship we'll still sleep with her like just just on the basis of her looks
(1:18:38) like we'll sleep with her but based off of her looks we would never be in a relationship with her she'll never get
(1:18:45) commitment she'll never get a relationship does that make does that
(1:18:50) parse for you like so for example if a guy's trying to get laid yeah like he just wants quick sex he'll lower his
(1:18:58) standards whereas women if they want to just get sex they'll actually typically
(1:19:04) they're not going to lower their standards looks-wise they're going to raise their standards look looks-wise
(1:19:10) they're going to be like well if I just want casual sex I want it to be the hottest guy I can get it whereas for a
(1:19:16) relationship they might recognize well I can't get that hot guy into a relationship cuz he just wants sex so I
(1:19:23) have to be more realistic when it comes to the physical attractiveness of a long-term partner mhm does that make
(1:19:31) yeah that's but I yeah I don't know that every well God this isn't going to apply to every woman but like I feel like I I
(1:19:38) if I wanted sex I would go just SE I would go for someone who I felt was in my league and or above you know yeah so
(1:19:46) the most beautiful men on planet Earth right for sure T tens right yeah well listen after discussing I lowered my
(1:19:54) number okay so don't [ __ ] on me but I'm just I'm just saying um from the
(1:20:00) perspective of a woman who says I'm a 10 they say well I'm going to go out and get a guy who's in my league that's
(1:20:06) every guy who exists right sure but I do think after hearing all this discussion like I think there is one thing to
(1:20:14) admitting or saying out loud that you're a 10 and then actually internalizing that and feeling that way it seems like
(1:20:20) more women just ask the question like myself would say yeah I'm a 10 but then realistically in their everyday lives I
(1:20:27) don't think they actually neither do we we think the exact same thing well no not we saying so we're saying the exact
(1:20:33) same thing right is that yeah you're you're correct that most women will identify themselves at an outrageously
(1:20:40) High number 8 9 10 um you know something in this category M but I don't think
(1:20:47) that they're being honest and when you you start to reduce why they're not being honest you start to recognize
(1:20:54) these kinds of patterns that it has more to do with how I feel more to do with how I want to present more more to do
(1:21:01) with that than how they actually think they rate compared to other women right
(1:21:06) so then if that's the case I don't know that everyone would delusionally go after the most attractive guy does that
(1:21:12) make sense right but that would make that would make our point for us it' be saying so if you wouldn't weren't going
(1:21:18) after the most attractive guys but you're going for whatever was in your league then this idea that you were a 10 and amongst the most beautiful planet
(1:21:24) Earth clearly can't be the case so that's the point right no and I think I
(1:21:29) got around to the point yeah but you did mention the patriarchy so while we go into that uh what is the patriarchy um
(1:21:37) the system of beliefs uh held by men who are you know um overly
(1:21:44) ow um to basically just set the their standard of what Society
(1:21:52) should be mhm based off their beliefs of you know are
(1:21:59) they and are they in power because they're men I mean sure probably
(1:22:06) mhm and so what percentage of men are in power a lot I don't know that's a very
(1:22:12) specific question but I mean do you think it might have more to do with like their class or status than the fact that
(1:22:19) they have a no I think it usually starts with them having a so I think they will
(1:22:25) get ahead in life a lot easier if they're men no no men are way Hard Men actually
(1:22:33) have to work to become something we are just we're just here like to be quite honest with you we could get into clubs
(1:22:39) without having to pay for [ __ ] we could get bottle service without having to pay for anything but can we get paid the same as men we do if we didn't that'd be
(1:22:46) that'd be an issue what are you talking about women do not at the end of the day if a woman cannot do the exact same
(1:22:51) amount of work as a man you can't expect that woman to get paid the same if a woman construction worker and a man construction worker we're we're working
(1:22:57) right now together the man is carrying 100 pounds of weight the woman could only carry 50 why the hell would that woman get paid the same why what about a
(1:23:03) man a man who's an executive and a woman who's an executive is she putting in the same amount of work yes I wouldn't I
(1:23:08) mean let's be real here if that woman is an executive and let's say she gets pregnant should she deserve the same amount of money as the man that's
(1:23:14) actually still going to be at the work at work besides you're at the mercy of the firm's argument which is if it were
(1:23:20) true the what you're saying is true that women who are not in these construction jobs and this type of thing but rather
(1:23:26) in kind of comfy AC related jobs like the men and they're getting paid less
(1:23:31) than them then why wouldn't a man create an entire firm of women and then destroy
(1:23:38) their their competition because they're now paying their staff way less yeah why not am I but am I wrong that women get
(1:23:46) paid less than men because I don't think I am I think that's pretty common knowledge but if that is the case right
(1:23:51) so this is what I'm questioning is the basis for this case right H if it were the case that that were true which which
(1:23:57) it is if it is then why doesn't why don't why doesn't a woman even or a man
(1:24:03) just hire a firm of these women and pay them less than the firm that are hiring men because they would make a killing
(1:24:09) with an all woman staff you tell you tell me I don't know I'm not a dude I'm not making that decision I if I hired a
(1:24:15) worm a firm full of women you bet I would pay them just as much as I'm like I'm not going to pay them less that's
(1:24:23) that seems yeah but backwards but you would think a man would right potentially I mean I
(1:24:29) don't know who's been paying us less I don't think it's women well then if it's men then why wouldn't a man just have a
(1:24:35) firm of all women and pay them less if they get the same amount of work out of them I mean that's a question for a dude
(1:24:42) I can't answer that like see why couldn't you answer that why wouldn't a man have a firm of all women and pay
(1:24:47) them less I don't know I mean cuz then they would destroy the competition who's
(1:24:53) paying the more right okay so I mean why don't we see that then if that's the case because
(1:25:00) it's not the case that men are making more in those positions than women are if it was the case that you could pay
(1:25:06) women less to do the same job then why wouldn't you just make a firm and pay all of them way less for the same job so
(1:25:13) so you're talking about the wage Gap right so why don't you tell us what your sense of the wage Gap is cuz there's these numbers that get thrown around
(1:25:20) women make 77 cents on the dollar as compared to men is that what you're talking about when you say the wage Gap
(1:25:26) so what is the number that you think it is it's it's around that like 80 80 cents something like that and then women
(1:25:31) of color make even less yeah can Nick we have something on that too so two things Nick the pay scale website on the wage
(1:25:38) Gap uh and then there's also it's so you just do uh Google pay scale wage Gap and
(1:25:43) then also in the infographics folder there is the uh hold
(1:25:49) on there's the wage folder and in it you you mentioned women you mentioned in uh
(1:25:55) women of color so Nick you're going to pull up uh
(1:26:00) just it's in the wage Gap folder the Asian women one but it's not not
(1:26:07) number two it's the one in the Middle with the more straight the straight lines do the Asian women first and we'll
(1:26:13) do PCO okay so you mentioned women of color
(1:26:18) actually Asian women out earn white men this is the median weekly earnings of full-time workers white men versus Asian
(1:26:25) women that's two minority categories higher paying jobs is what you're saying
(1:26:31) no across the board am I doing a doing a comparison to
(1:26:36) comparison so it's I'm my understanding of how they this is the from the Bureau of Labor Statistics they just take all
(1:26:43) the earnings of men all the earns all excuse me all the earnings of white men compared to all the earnings of Asian
(1:26:49) women now these are all full-time workers mind you now the wage Gap that you referenced earlier that encompasses
(1:26:56) all the money that men bring in and all the money women bring in so it could be
(1:27:02) making a comparison of a woman who has a part-time job as Barista and part of
(1:27:07) that data is also comparing it to men who work on oil rigs who get Hazard pay
(1:27:13) and then where are you guys pulling your stuff from Nick you can pull up pay scale pay scale is a fairly uh it's
(1:27:20) actually pretty I think it's actually pretty left leaning uh it's a fairly reputable uh company can you scroll down
(1:27:27) Nick there should be like a circle chart scroll
(1:27:33) down okay can you scroll in on that one you might even be able to right click and I don't know if it's an image the
(1:27:40) gender pay Gap in 2024 so the uncontrolled gender pay gap which is what you're talking about women earn 83
(1:27:46) cents for every $1 earned by men including like part-time and all that well this is where you're not factoring
(1:27:51) you're not controlling for anything so it's all the money that women make all the money that men make but it's not
(1:27:56) factoring in for the fact that for example men all men collectively work more hours than women they're more
(1:28:03) likely to work hour or excuse me overtime they're more likely to relocate they're more likely to work Hazard pay
(1:28:09) etc etc etc pull it back up real quick the controled gender pay Gap so this measures median salary for men and women
(1:28:15) with the same job and qualifications all men and all women all men well it's same
(1:28:21) job same qualifications Okay so if you actually control for each of these things and you start removing
(1:28:28) these variances like hours worked different job field different choices it
(1:28:33) shrinks down to 99 Cents it's still below right but it's I
(1:28:39) mean it's still um you make a penny less than a man man that's rough but let me well let
(1:28:47) me ask you this just out of curiosity I always wondered this question even if it
(1:28:52) were true that who owned firms of some type or another did hire women at a
(1:28:58) lesser wage than they hired men who the cares why is that even a problem if
(1:29:04) they're just like I just don't want these women to make as much as the men that I hire why is that actually a
(1:29:11) problem I mean it's a moral problem what is the moral problem I mean that dude's like a piece of [ __ ] why why would it
(1:29:18) make him a piece of [ __ ] because he doesn't value women as much as he values men he doesn't value their labor as
(1:29:25) much but but if it's the same labor even if it's the same labor he just doesn't value it as much well then I think that
(1:29:30) says something about what how he values women yeah but how would it actually be immoral like why would it be immoral for
(1:29:36) instance if you owned you own business you said right why would it actually be immoral
(1:29:42) for you to be like I just don't want to hire men at all I just don't want to even hire them because I don't like
(1:29:47) their faces why would that even be actually immoral or problematic I think it's problematic because you're not
(1:29:53) considering ing different perspectives that can contribute to the work that you're doing but it's yours why do you
(1:29:59) need to consider other perspectives like the other perspect it's your [ __ ] right like if you found a business right
(1:30:06) and you built it up for 10 years and you're going to start hiring people and you're like I don't like women I just
(1:30:11) don't like them I don't like them so I'm not going to hire any I was thinking about this and I was trying to figure
(1:30:17) out what the what's actually a moral about that I mean I just I guess I just think
(1:30:24) it speaks to like the the person's values essentially like that they
(1:30:30) don't John Smith donated $200k you the reason these feminists and
(1:30:36) angry women are so upset is because they don't have a man to tell them to calm down and relax are you going to do it
(1:30:43) John Smith calm down calm down relax my God relax I think I just
(1:30:49) came what oh my God anyway what the
(1:30:55) yeah so I was I was just wondering if you could elucidate me why you would actually think that that was immoral I
(1:31:00) get that you you wouldn't like it you're saying you're saying I don't like women I don't want like that's such a like I
(1:31:07) don't think that that's like good moral standards to just like it kind of relates to all the [ __ ] that we've been
(1:31:13) talking about with her and how she wants to hurt men and [ __ ] right like it doesn't feel so far away from that yeah
(1:31:18) I mean maybe not but let us assume that a man goes you know a woman's labor right right it's worth as much as a
(1:31:25) man's and in so far as the labor she actually does and the labor he's actually doing it's about the same but
(1:31:30) they just caus so many problems right they cause all sorts of issues they complain a lot they're always at the HR
(1:31:37) department because they got too flirtzy with a guy at work they're just a pain in theing ass to deal with they're just
(1:31:44) a pain in the ass and if I have an all male Workforce I don't have to deal with any of those problems but you have that
(1:31:49) seems like it's a really Justified and reasoned reason are you saying that all women are like that and that women are
(1:31:54) just causing problems in the workplace because I don't think I'm assum most women aren't like that okay but I'm
(1:32:02) going to assume that there's enough of them that are that you're still gambling and that if it's even 20% I can
(1:32:08) understand the rationale and could not say it was immoral for a person to be like yeah I don't want to deal with all
(1:32:15) that I literally just don't want to deal with it to not hire them yeah to just not hire them I have my own business if
(1:32:21) I I mean I don't plan on hiring anybody I like just working for myself but I could see that if someone was like oh I
(1:32:27) just don't want to hire them I don't think that that's an issue but if it was like oh I'm going to hire them they're doing the same work but I'm paying them
(1:32:33) less because I think that they're doing more complaints like you know I don't know I think
(1:32:39) that um sorry I lost my turn of thought but I just don't think that like all
(1:32:44) women are just inherently like going to cause problems or like totally completely 100% agree but let's say it's
(1:32:52) 10% which is a lot that's a lot can you just fire fire the one that's like one
(1:32:57) in 10 women that you hire well but the problem's already caused right the pro the issue is already there and you're
(1:33:03) like ah you know in this Factory right I can have a hot dog put or a guy put the
(1:33:08) hot dogs on the little pallet and then it goes up or I can have a woman do it they do it about as fast they do about
(1:33:14) as much work but I never have to deal with the you think there's a little bit of inherent sexism though in that like I
(1:33:21) think there's like a little bit of inherent sexism my question is not whether or not it's
(1:33:26) sexist my question would be who cares if it is why would that be a problem to be
(1:33:32) sexist under those circumstances I just don't so in other words sexism itself I'm not sure is immoral in and of itself
(1:33:39) if it's indicating a behavior that you're trying to avoid so for instance wouldn't it be sexist well I'll explain
(1:33:46) wouldn't it be sexist for instance for you at night to walk across the street
(1:33:51) if a group of men are moving toward W you oh my God uh yes cuz I would not walk I would
(1:33:58) not change what I was doing if I saw a group of women if I saw a group of men I would be a million times more likely that I'm going so are you
(1:34:06) sexist I think it just I me H are you sexist well in for my own protection in
(1:34:12) that case I would say yes for your own protection in that case yes I will be
(1:34:18) sexist and aren't we saying the exact same thing although mine could be life or death yours is not life or death are
(1:34:25) different or or right it could be the life and death of your your business and
(1:34:30) yeah that could that's basically to the financial ruination your life family everything else I agree that maybe the
(1:34:37) stakes are slightly higher from the physical aspect but the principle is the same I'm sexist towards this group
(1:34:44) because Mo even though most people in this group aren't going to do this enough of them will right that I feel
(1:34:50) like crossing the street probably a good idea and do you think men would blame you for doing that no no they're like
(1:34:58) get go across the street we know that there's predatory men yeah right so why would men get blamed for not wanting to
(1:35:04) hire women for that's my thing that's why I'm like is it immoral I'm I have a
(1:35:09) question you say men do the like you're saying that what you say 10 or 5% of women cause problems in the workplace
(1:35:16) race assuming it for like the sake of the for the sake of the hypothetical would you not say the same thing about
(1:35:22) men no really yes really yeah if you about the men that can't keep it in their pants at
(1:35:28) working but hang on but are you going to have that problem if you have an all
(1:35:34) male Workforce but you're saying hangang but what if it's an allw woman Workforce yeah but if it's an allw woman Workforce
(1:35:39) and you have caddy backstabbing and all all sorts of other issues you don't have the oh my dick is bigger than yours like
(1:35:45) I sell more than you then let's test this okay do you think that uh at all
(1:35:51) female private schools versus all male private schools there's more complaints from the students who are men or more
(1:35:57) complaints from the students who are girls I just if you had to guess
(1:36:02) probably probably the girls why hang on wait wait why do you think that I think
(1:36:08) that girls are also just more vocal about it though their complaints so then they're going to cause more so soang
(1:36:14) exactly so wait a second so if I have a Workforce of men who have complaints but shut their mouths about them versus a
(1:36:20) Workforce of women who have complaints and don't which one would want but I think that all women Workforce and all
(1:36:25) men Workforce have equal amount of problems they're just different yeah no if you're saying that
(1:36:32) one of them's complaining constantly and the other one's not complaining constantly that's already a huge problem
(1:36:38) necessar in the workforce I think there's some level of professional professionality that women have when it
(1:36:43) comes to working that they're just not going to be sitting there complaining 24/7 really well let me ask you a question a competent woman yes let me
(1:36:49) ask you a question like and give me your honest answer okay let's assume you had
(1:36:54) two different offices that you could choose from one office employed 300
(1:37:01) women the other office employed 299 men and you okay 299 men plus you which
(1:37:10) office would you prefer to work out which one's better or you saying
(1:37:15) they're equal they're equal they give you the same pay right I just I don't think it really
(1:37:22) matters I mean at that point it which one I would be happier with which one do you think be Happ
(1:37:27) with depends on who the boss is how like the boss is a man in one in both cases
(1:37:32) no and the other one it's a woman I don't really think there's a difference no you wouldn't care I
(1:37:38) wouldn't care all there would be no preference I mean maybe if like the male one cuz I'd feel like oh you know I'm kind of special but like that's it cuz
(1:37:45) I'm the only woman that was hired like I'm you know but like and you don't think that that would have anything to do with the fact that there would be way
(1:37:50) less caddy [ __ ] backstabbing bitching why complaining telling you all about how she's a mean [ __ ] the second
(1:37:58) she walks out of the room to you and you have drama clicks all over the place I don't disagree with that what I'm saying
(1:38:03) those men have equal issues just in different way here's what happens a bunch of men like I would feel
(1:38:11) way more comfortable with a bunch of women I would feel more connected to them I better I would be more motivated
(1:38:17) here's what happens on a construction site right or something like this um they're all [ __ ] exhausted from
(1:38:23) working asses off and they don't have time to whine and complain and click and and do all that [ __ ] they just don't and
(1:38:28) inside of office spaces sales spaces things like that yeah there's a bit of that for men but to say it's anywhere on
(1:38:34) par like it is for women you talk to women who are in these sales jobs and they're like oh my God these [ __ ] are
(1:38:40) awful they're backstabbers they're connivers they click up if you're not part of the click they you know they're
(1:38:46) just horrible insufferable I think that's like putting a very like big stigma on woman I don't
(1:38:52) think especially is putting a very big stigma on but the question is whether or not the stigma is deserved I think no I
(1:38:59) think especially that's like one thing that I said like I would say I disagree with the podcast that the women that are selected to usually be on this podcast
(1:39:05) are somewhat kind of like that and represent a different kind of like the more problematic side of women which I'm
(1:39:12) agree a large majority of women can be problem you ever talked to a hair stylist before I mean yes well have they
(1:39:20) ever told you what it's like to work in the beauty industry I was I got my hair three days ago she was talking to me about how all the sororities girls come
(1:39:26) in and they talk [ __ ] all on each other and she just hears it all day all day every day I'm not disagreeing with that
(1:39:32) all but that's the thing is that's why the stigma exists the stigma hang on the stigma exists specifically because of
(1:39:39) the application so what I'm saying to you is if she's willing to cross the street based on her sexism there's this
(1:39:45) low percentage of men who are actually predatory in fact almost every man you walk by in the middle of the night is
(1:39:51) not going to do anything to you do I blame you for crossing the street though not really not really cuz I can
(1:39:57) understand I can rationalize in my brain why a woman would want to do that and I'd recommend my wife to do it she's
(1:40:03) walking down the street in the middle of the night under some circumstance cross the street have a totally rational yes I
(1:40:08) have a wife totally rational to me okay but it's equally rational to me
(1:40:14) then to say okay if I had a firm right and there was some inbuilt sexism based around the
(1:40:20) stigma would it be rational for me to only want to hire men I think it's rational to say I only would want to
(1:40:26) hire men I don't think it's immoral that a person would move down that um that
(1:40:33) thought pattern of I'll only hire X based on uh social stigmas which can
(1:40:39) cause serious problems to their business for their own protection that's all I'm saying yeah
