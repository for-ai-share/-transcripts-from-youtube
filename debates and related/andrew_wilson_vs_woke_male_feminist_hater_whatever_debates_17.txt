(1:26) going to open so go ahead my name is Raphael Gomez i'm the host of Women on Men where I interview women about men
() 
(1:32) and dating and here's my opening statement i'm not here to fight men i'm
(1:37) here to fight for them because the red pill is presented as medicine but it's actually a poison and peer-reviewed
(1:43) research proves it red Pill Amanda's fear content prays on angry rejected men and turns their pain into blame it tells
(1:50) them women are the enemy that dating is a war and they're losing that feminism ruined everything the very people they
(1:57) want to date become their adversaries and it's easier to buy into that story than to look inward but the science is
(2:03) clear studies consistently show that red pill communities promote hostile sexism
(2:08) dehumanize women and radicalize male pain into misogyny and to top it off it's not helping them date either men
(2:15) who endorse red pill beliefs report higher levels of loneliness romantic dissatisfaction and psychological
(2:21) distress but the consequences are real and deadly just a short drive from this studio Elliot Roger murdered six people
(2:28) at UC Santa Barbara with the manifesto filled with hatred for women
(2:33) don't do that don't do what don't do the manifesto don't do that for YouTube
(2:39) purposes like just skip that part or maybe the point go ahead okay and he
(2:44) became a martyr for red pill communities a symbol of what happens when male pain fers into violence for all the lectures
(2:51) about female nature and alpha dominance red pill men aren't forming real relationships they're staying single
(2:56) bitter and stuck the more they consume this content the worse their life gets not because women changed but because
(3:02) they did in the end it leaves them lonely angry and blaming everyone but the ideology that failed them just this
(3:09) week Andrew called red red pill creators degenerates for pushing casual sex
(3:15) discouraging marriage and obsessing over status yet here he is today defending that same ecosystem he also said that
(3:22) the divide between men and women is a good thing because he believes women will cave first andrew wants to keep
(3:27) that division wide because it serves his personal crusade to eradicate feminism even if it means sacrificing the
(3:33) well-being of the very men he claims to protect that's my opening statement
(3:39) okay so I'll respond a few things by the way my name is Andrew Wilson the host of The
(3:46) Crucible uh welcome to Well actually thank you guys for having me especially
(3:51) the Whatever podcast chat always nice to be back with you guys and of course the Crucible Crew uh thank my opponent for
(3:59) coming out as well for this um so the first thing is you mentioned that the the red pills poison uh and women are
(4:06) enemies adversaries i think that you're making a very classic mistake that many people make which is that you're
(4:13) associating content creators and their views with what the red pill is and so maybe we can get in what you think the
(4:19) red pill actually is sure um so you say that um the red pills
(4:26) making men stay single and uh and stay miserable etc etc uh we can get into
(4:32) that too uh I actually didn't say that red pillars were degenerates and I'm
(4:38) guessing that you're referencing the Pearl Davis debate uh no you said this on your channel you were talking to a gentleman on your own channel i can't
(4:44) remember he was talking on an iPad you didn't like the sound it was something you posted I think Tuesday okay yeah yeah so um there are a lot of
(4:52) degenerates who are redpillars but I didn't I wouldn't make the claim that
(4:57) the red pill to me is just a descriptive packet uh and you say that Andrew wants
(5:03) uh feminism to be destroyed at the expense of men it's the opposite i want feminism to be destroyed because I think
(5:09) that that protects and helps and assists men so I'm talking about a gender divide
(5:14) um what what I'm what I'm disassociating is that there needs to be when I say gender divide women in the role of
(5:20) female gender roles and men in the role of male gender roles so that's the divide I'm looking at now I'm not
(5:27) looking at a divide of uh like men and women not being close to each other i'm looking at the divide of I don't want uh
(5:34) sameness when it comes to gender roles because that's really bad and it does not suit society very well so um kind of
(5:41) with that I'm happy to just kind of dive into whatever you want here sure um so I
(5:46) know you say the red pill is kind of this ideology but red pill not an ideology whatever word you used um it's
(5:54) a package it's a data packet i've heard you say that i understand um but the only way that message is really
(5:59) disseminated is often through these big content creators most of the people come across a red pill from things like Fresh
() 
(6:04) and Fit Andrew Tate this channel um it's that's how that package is distributed
(6:10) and there are prescriptive messages how did they come across it i don't know the internet is the internet the algorithm
(6:15) do you think they made it up do I think who made it up that those red pill creators that you're talking about do you think that they just made all that
(6:21) stuff up no I don't i think there's too many similar messages for it to be made up yeah so there's like sources for this stuff right wherever they're sourcing it
(6:28) from I'm not sure they're dissimating one such source would be a guy his name is Rolo Tamasi
(6:33) um the godfather the red pill he's going to be pissed that I said that because it's like an ongoing meme but um he
(6:41) calls it a praxiology right so if it's if it's praxiological from his
(6:47) perspective he's saying there's no prescriptions here right it's not it's not designed around prescriptors it's
(6:53) designed around descriptors so if you're going to criticize the red pill you should probably start by criticizing the
(6:59) descriptors um but if you wanted to criticize individual content creators
(7:04) for their prescriptions I think that that's fine but that's not the red pill the red pill is a data packet of
(7:11) descriptions which are trying to to express and explain interpersonal sexual
(7:16) dynamics between men and women i think the gentleman you mentioned most people haven't heard of um I think most people
(7:22) are getting heard of them i think most of the people are getting their information from the millions of subscriptions to Fresh and Fit and
(7:28) whatever and fresh and fit he goes on often they have a very close Myron Gaines I'm sure is much more popular
(7:34) than him yeah well the thing is is like maybe but Myron Gaines is not the Are
(7:39) you saying he's the red pill i think he's one of them okay so what So what is Let's start with that what is the red pill i consider it content that claims
(7:46) to reveal the truth about women but promotes misogyny and male victimhood okay so um you think that the
(7:54) descriptors do that i think the content creators that are prescribing what the red pill is it's not so it's not about
(8:01) So it's about content creators sure you just think that So there's just content creators who you disagree with their
(8:06) message um the majority of the red pill content creators that disagree with their message well okay but okay well
(8:13) what's the majority like how many do you think there are the most popular of the bunch the ones that have the most viewers subscribers okay so who are
(8:19) these guys that you're talking about um Fresh and Fit is a big one andrew Tate is another one and the Whatever podcast is another one fresh
(8:26) fit date and whatever so here's an easy one
(8:33) i guess let's start with whatever because I'm intric I'm pretty familiar with the content
(8:39) here um so what is the message that's being put out there um there's a lot of
(8:44) misogynist messages that come out of this podcast and I have Well let's start with what is misogyny misogyny is the
(8:50) hatred or dislike of women the active dislike of women uh plural women yeah correct the entire
(8:58) gender so not the active dislike of a woman no not typically so it's just women yeah okay so misogyny is the
(9:04) active hatred or dislike of women got it all right and fresh and fit is another
(9:09) big let's start with whatever okay yeah so what is the misogyny or the dislike
(9:15) of women which is promoted on this channel every the it's presented as a dating podcast but it's really not um
(9:20) the topics that typically come up on this podcast that what makes it not a dating podcast i'm about to go into that oh okay go ahead um a dating podcast
(9:28) should not discuss whether or not women should be submissive whether women should vote on Sunday Sunday's show you
(9:34) ask women how many pumps after they tell you to stop is it grape that's not a dating podcast that's one of the
(9:40) craziest questions I've ever heard um you basically say divor divorce hurts men marriage is pointless i don't know
(9:47) how that's helping your audience i don't know how military conscription has anything to do with a dating podcast i
(9:52) don't know how uh you know guests being shown a submissive ex-girlfriend and
(9:58) saying "Would you bow to your husband would you bow to your husband?" That's not a dating podcast that is promoting
(10:03) hatred of women and and misogyny as well um female guests are pressured to reveal their body count and then mocked if they
(10:09) don't reveal they're interrogated until they reveal um women with Only Fans are
(10:15) moralized and told to quit um male promiscuity is excused and celebrated um
(10:21) women are asked about their peak looks age and questioned incessantly segments like Man Bear versus Woods mock women's
(10:28) very real fears about male violence even though statistical realities are ignored and and dismissed as irrational um the
(10:35) super chat roast um the guests love to [ __ ] on these women every chance they get and on this show feminism and women
(10:42) are blamed for most of men's problems can I have a Do you have a copy of that
(10:49) i'd like to see it the thing because you just shotguns a bunch of points and
(10:54) Andrew might you want it one by one i also have peer-reviewed studies if you want those two yeah if you have any
(11:01) especially if they have a meta analysis I'd like to see them and and just to be before you give your response Andrew my
(11:07) understanding here for the the debate was primarily going to be about feminism not specific criticisms of the Well I
(11:14) mean this is prompts were about manosphere and red pill yeah so this is
(11:19) I'm actually fine with this right so um why it's not really a dating podcast
(11:26) whether women should be submissive um why I don't understand why would that not be relational to dating what does
(11:33) submission have to do with dating well because dating is a especially on a dating show you would be significantly
(11:39) talking about people's preferences when it came to the the social experiences or having with the opposite sex you're not
() 
(11:46) talking about your preferences you're talking about their preferences cuz when you talk about submission you're talking about from your worldview women should
(11:51) be submissive okay but what from their worldview they could also have maybe a counter to that why they shouldn't or uh
(11:57) also a lot of them say yes they should so the idea here for submission
(12:02) especially would be I don't I don't see how that's not dating related i I don't know how submission comes up on any sort
(12:08) of date i don't know if you've ever been on a date in in the last So okay so if I ask you what type of woman do you want
(12:15) mhm and you go through the traits and you say "I'd also like a submissive
(12:20) woman." Does that make sense to say as a trait sure i don't know many people that would just offer that up as one of the
(12:25) first things they want a woman but maybe those are the people you hang out with who said it was the first if you're if I'm asking you said if you ask somebody
(12:30) if I'm asking what's your dynamic and one of the answers is a submissive woman that comes up all the time for men in
(12:37) dating okay in your circles perhaps i mean no just in what it Well how many
(12:43) dating podcast sample sizes do you have here i listen I'm I'm on a dating podcast i made one i listen to a lot I
(12:49) listen to a lot of your shows i listen to a lot of everything that's out there i don't understand any of the dating podcasts that come up when you ask men
(12:56) their preference they've never once said "I would prefer to have a woman who's more submissive." The topic of
(13:01) submission only comes up on Red Pill podcast no it doesn't only come up on podcast it's been on Dr phil it's been
(13:08) everywhere dr phil talks about submission every episode every episode i didn't say every episode doing a dating
() 
(13:14) is he doing a dating podcast don't mention Dr phil as a dating show don't mention Dr phil mentioned that's not a
(13:20) dating show you asked where else it's mentioned as a dating show that is not a dating show yeah so in in in any case
(13:25) any of the dating podcasts that I've seen is a very common answer to say that they want to name another dating podcast
(13:30) and here's the other thing to dive into this name another dating podcast here's the other thing to dive into this well you got to name another dating podcast
(13:35) okay fresh and fit happens there all the time red pill content exactly as I said okay so when you're talking about a
(13:41) dating podcast what do you mean by that something a little less I don't know misogynistic perhaps what does that mean
(13:47) though i've already explained it to you and defined it if any man has a has a dating podcast is it uh red pill or I
(13:54) have a dating podcast and it's not misogynistic i see and let me ask you a question what kind of questions do you ask on your dating podcast i asked them
(14:00) what are their priorities in a man i asked them "Do you have advice for men and dating?" How many uh how many men
(14:05) have you had on zero it's called women on men oh I see so you're a misandress absolutely not well I don't understand
(14:11) why don't you want a man's opinion because I want to ask women specifically that has nothing missandry involves hate
(14:16) and I don't hate men oh okay i got it so so you only have on women correct and you don't ask them when you ask them
(14:23) about preferences right do they say that they want things like assertive men no do they say that
(14:29) they want less assertive men i give them a list of 10 traits and say "Rank these between your top three and your bottom
(14:35) three." Okay so you're you're giving them the answers i'm not giving them the answers they take a lot of time to think about it but you just said you gave them
(14:42) 10 traits yeah that that's not the answers those are options yeah that's answers to that there are options you
(14:48) can choose from it's a multiple choice that's not answers yes it's answers okay they're answers Andrew yeah you gave
(14:54) them 10 answers and say "Choose from these." And then they sort them yeah but that doesn't mean that's their answer you're making them choose from answers
(15:00) that you give them so you're literally feeding them their answers and and then they choose them yep and they don't come
(15:05) and say "Man I wish you would have had this on the Why is it then?" Well how long have you been doing it can we get back to Can we get back to misogynistic
(15:12) podcast if it is the case that can we get back to misogynist the case that it is your criticism can we get back to misogynist
(15:18) if you're going to have criticism for whatever I'm going to have criticism for your podcast you haven't even listened to it so don't don't talk about it do I
(15:23) need to pull it to it from you go ahead pull it up on YouTube I can listen to it from you go ahead and pull it up on YouTube you have not watched my podcast
(15:29) so don't sit here we're not going to critique my podcast why not because you haven't even watched it let's watch it go ahead pull it up so if we pull it 45
(15:36) minutes 45 minutes 45 minutes put on two times speed and then we can critique my podcast but until then tell me about
(15:42) another non-misogynistic red pill podcast well I don't think any of those are misogynistic podcasts yeah of course not you got to demonstrate that they
(15:48) actually hate these women by their actions by the things everything that's happening right there yeah so so let's
(15:54) go through some more of these when Myroning Gains has a has a a college uh table that says women deserve less you
() 
(16:00) don't think that's a little misogynistic is that during his podcast he is one of the red pill content creators that we're
(16:07) talking about i had to be a podcast dude i thought I had to be a podcast doesn't have to be a podcast act like an adult
(16:13) that is the most childish thing I've ever seen in my whole life that's You put the You gave me the criteria the criteria is the content creators
(16:19) including my ring gains yes i've always said that nothing's changed in my We're talking about dating podcast the idea of
(16:25) dating correct is it also possible there's just not that many yeah there's not a lot of red pill podcast the No no
(16:30) just dating podcast there's a ton of dating podcast okay name some mine name some other ones um there's a guy named
(16:37) Man We're in Trouble um there's um Eeveeit there's uh Eevee edits a a
(16:44) dating podcast yeah she talks about dating and men and women say a dating podcast though yes so they have This
(16:51) isn't a dating podcast hang on so they have This isn't a dating podcast so on Eeveeedit they have uh every single time
(16:57) they come on they have multitudes of people on with them and all they talk about necessarily say they have guests i'm not talking about the format i'm
(17:02) saying that's what the content that comes up is men and women and this is not a dating podcast that we're currently on you're just talking about
(17:08) for you a dating podcast just anybody who's talking about dating this is not a dating podcast that we're currently on
(17:14) well prove it it's I just did how let's go through more you want me to read them
(17:19) so here why don't we do the first one whether women should be submissive I don't I don't understand how's Again how
(17:26) would that not Yeah actually how would that not be uh a decent question to ask
(17:32) for dating i don't get it do you ask that on your first dates what if a woman would be submissive yeah no exactly cuz
(17:38) it's not a dating question why would that Wait hang on let's back up let's assume for a second that anything that I
(17:45) would ask a woman on the first date isn't something you would ask a woman on the first date what does that prove i'm saying the things you guys do how do you
(17:51) think you're going to look better in 10 years do you think you're going to look better in 10 years is that something you ask on the date what's your body count
(17:57) do you ask that on the first date can you answer my question do you ask what's a body count on the first date before Before you start shopping you have
(18:02) different questions before you start any questions you have different questions i'll never answer one of yours if you never answer one of mine go ahead Andrew
(18:08) so so here here we go again what does it actually prove what does it prove that
(18:16) if I asked a whole sequence of different questions from you on my first date what does that prove
(18:22) that you're not asking these questions on your first date can you answer my question i just did what does it prove it proves that you're not asking these
(18:28) questions so it doesn't prove anything it does prove it what does it prove that you're not asking these kinds of questions on your first date so what is
(18:35) that proving outside of that it proves that these are more mis Hang on does it also prove that I don't ask any other
(18:41) questions other people would ask that you're not asking here i have no idea if it proves anything like it's just so stupid dude it proves nothing what does
(18:47) it prove what do those questions prove nothing they don't prove anything okay this is just a pure dating podcast
(18:54) dating is about your preferences anecdotes experiences it's about how many pumps after she says stop is grape
(19:02) that's a dating podcast you think that when people Hold on answer that question answer i'll answer it i don't think you are you have to stop talking i can't
(19:09) answer it so stop talking and I'll answer it is it the case that when you have uh you know half a dozen people who
(19:16) are sitting at a table and they're building a rapport with each other that they crack jokes you think that's a joke
(19:22) how many pumps after a woman says stop is it grape is a joke who laughs at that uh lots of people i think it's funny i
(19:28) I'm not surprised you think it's funny i think you think it's funny i'm sure you think it's funny it is funny do you know But do you know why it's funny what
(19:34) makes it funny cuz you're a little misogynistic no no no it's because a feminist on this program a few months
(19:39) ago i remember i saw it yeah yeah so I don't So it's a call back to that it's not a call back to that yeah it's a call
(19:44) back to that because that was not about stopping yeah it was about consent yeah but that was about your wife sleeping and you banging her while she's sleeping
(19:51) but that does if she says stop and you keep going is that consent that Well the idea there is how long after is is are
(19:58) you violating consent that's the idea yeah it's a dating podcast topic right of course no yeah of course people talk about that all the time right do you
(20:04) think that in the age in this modern age where interexual and interpersonal
(20:10) dynamics between men and women are so [ __ ] up and they are [ __ ] up and you're contributing right do you think
(20:15) that the idea when you have tons of people who are out there talking about consent you have feminist academics who
() 
(20:21) are talking about if two people are drunk and they have sex they're actually technically raping each other raping each other right do you really think
(20:28) that these are inappropriate questions to ask during a dating podcast in modernity i absolutely believe it's
(20:34) inappropriate to say how many pumps after a woman says stop is it grape that
(20:39) is inappropriate why because it should just be after she says stop tell me how many not going to answer that question you're not going to answer it no cuz
(20:45) it's a stupid ass question i don't know i think it's a fair question of course you do cuz you're misogynistic what's misogynistic about it because that is
(20:50) grape you're talking about grape in such a lightarted manner i just answered the question how does that prove I hate women dude we can go down the list of
(20:58) things you've said go down the list out of your 5,000 debates go down the list do you like women at all love them oh
(21:04) you love them sure you know you know it's so funny to talk about grapes so funny the fact the fact
(21:11) that you would laugh at a grape question shows that you don't like women i laugh oh hang on hang on are you saying I hate men because I laugh about prison grape
(21:17) no you don't hate I don't get it though that's a double standard you don't hate men you don't You love You only care
(21:22) about men so if I make light of a man getting raped you don't see that's that's fine you don't see it the same
(21:28) and it's not I don't how do I see it you tell me you see women is so much less than prove it I'm looking for the
(21:34) demonstration not the assertion just watch just watch the assertion just watch videos just watch Andrew's videos
(21:41) yeah exactly yeah don't prove no evidence yeah no I'm making it up I'm making it up so just tell me real quick
(21:47) how can you uh affirm that I hate women cuz I might make light of a grape joke
(21:53) for women but I don't hate men if I make light of a grape joke for a men i'm not sure you know I know you're not sure cuz
(21:58) that makes no [ __ ] sense so moving on to the next one um as we go through this uh whether
(22:05) women should vote so in modernity women's voting habits right uh have a
(22:11) lot to do with the modern state of society don't they sure and they have to do with um with the state of of people
(22:19) who want maybe patriarchy or they want highly religious women who allow men to lead uh or women who will turn over
() 
(22:27) their ability to vote to their own husband and say "You just tell me where to vote?" Yeah you agree with all of that sure okay so then why wouldn't it
(22:36) be pertinent to ask women what they think about women's voting patterns and voting habits because you talk about
(22:42) revoking the right for women to vote so so it's just just an easy conversation people have should women vote that's
(22:48) just something that people talk about around their dinner table right it's okay do you think that was an easy conversation when you were talking about
(22:55) whether or not it was okay for white women to vote to date black men do I think what was an easy conversation that
(23:00) conversation sure pre premisination was pretty hard conversation right but do you think that it was pertinent to
(23:06) dating at the time sure okay so then if that was pertinent to dating at the time and they were talking about all the
(23:12) reasons you should or shouldn't do this and it's a political and it's a political ideology both on both sides
(23:18) right why is it not appropriate for us to have a conversation about women's voting patterns when it comes to
(23:24) relationships it's not women's voting patterns it's should women vote that's not about patterns yeah it is that is
(23:30) the question about women well how would you determine if they should or shouldn't i just think everyone should
(23:35) oh you just think that yeah tell me why i don't need to you don't need to no okay so the thing is is um I'll I'll
(23:42) I'll just I'll just release you from this i'll just let you skip out on giving me no justification for why
(23:48) everybody should be able to vote i I don't I don't need What I want to know I would like to know you don't need one i don't need a justification justification
(23:55) i don't need justification to ask a woman uh if if she thinks other women should have the right to vote in order
(24:00) for me to judge whether or not she's a submissive woman or not sure but that's not a dating topic that's just you being political i want to judge if that's you
(24:06) being political you guys push your conservative agenda on this channel and that's what you do do you think that I want to live in it well I do yeah you do
(24:12) and so Jim Bob I know because homie just sits back and chills brian's chilling he's eating popcorn while you ask these
(24:19) questions yeah it's But I mean I literally have made It's his podcast i've never made any qualms that I'm here
(24:24) to represent my worldview i know but it's a dating podcast and you're asking these crazy questions they're not crazy they're absolutely should women vote is
(24:31) a crazy question in 2025 can I also ask you this do you think that men and women
(24:38) get and when they're in relationships get into political arguments often sure constantly right i mean theoretically if
(24:44) you're dating somebody with the same values you're not but if you marry if you marry a woman and she votes against
(24:50) your vote would that create marital issues maybe but I don't think you probably
(24:56) would have ever married that person to begin with because you don't have Probably not you know why because you asked her what she thought about the
(25:01) right to vote and she said "I want women to have the right to vote." And so he didn't [ __ ] marry her or he didn't date her because she doesn't align with
(25:07) you politically does that do you know do you know people that that do that do you know people that say I won't marry this
(25:12) woman because she thinks women should marry an overly assertive woman who thinks that she's going to be politically dominant in my home of
(25:18) course it has nothing to do about politically dominant you said if I ask a woman do you think women should vote and she says yes i'm not going to date that
(25:24) person and then but hang on but then you ask her why no I don't ask her why i know but if you were going to date her
(25:29) you should no because I think women should vote i know you think that you're not every man who lives wow how many How
(25:36) many men don't think women should vote i have no idea but at least a significant think it's a significant amount yeah I
(25:42) do but give me a percentage of how I have no idea throw it out you're a smart guy that would be impossible throw it
(25:47) out you're a smart guy you can you can assume how many men throw out a number throw out a percentage in your gut in your heart of hearts how many men don't
(25:53) want women to vote i'll throw that out if you throw out how many do okay okay you first how many men want How many men
(26:00) want women to vote i say at least 90% based on Man I know so no that's it yeah
(26:06) so based on anecdote exactly just like I'm asking you to do yeah that's why I wouldn't give you one yeah because I don't deal in anecdotes no no we don't
(26:12) deal on anecdotes at all you deal in anecdotes all the time but No I don't unless you're asking me about something anecdotal okay so anyway um yeah there's
(26:20) no reason there's actually no good reason that you've given me yet for why it's not pertinent inside of a man's
(26:25) dating life if he wants a submissive woman why he she wouldn't be politically aligned with his ideology okay so just
(26:33) pointing that out you actually still haven't given me a reason on Sunday's show you asked well I didn't
(26:38) ask this so I don't know anything about it um how many pumps after a woman uh
(26:43) says stop before it becomes grape mhm i didn't ask that i know but it's that's why this isn't a dating podcast because
(26:50) you made a joke that's not a joke yeah it's a callback joke it's not clear to me that it's not it's not clear because
(26:55) it's a totally different scenario okay even Even though you really don't think that that's about consent i know what
(27:02) the joke was i remember it wasn't debate you're a joke i'm talking about the call
(27:08) back i'm saying this is not a joke so So what makes it not a joke because it's not funny oh so So you don't find it
(27:14) funny so nobody find it funny nobody was laughing not a single person so if I So if I go back to that time stamp and I
(27:20) look at it go please do pull up and nobody's gonna say anything pull it up now nobody's gonna say anything the only person that kind of chuckled was Brian
(27:25) so then it was a joke no then why did Brian laugh i'm not sure cuz he thought
(27:31) it was funny perhaps if the joke teller thinks it's funny that's that's a problem why because if no one else is
(27:37) laughing except the joke teller that's a problem that just means it's a bad joke not that it's not a joke okay it's so funny yeah you're right yeah but I mean
(27:44) can people tell bad jokes sure and nobody laughs yeah bad jokes about But if you tell the joke and then you laugh
(27:51) do you think it was intended as a dating podcast yeah do you think it was intended as a joke no I don't so why did
(27:56) he laugh i'm not sure yeah that's Maybe maybe out of awkward maybe out of insecurity maybe out of all Yeah people
(28:03) laugh out in uncomfortable circumstances you do it all the time like when I asked you why you said because he thought it
(28:08) was funny i Maybe it's insecurity i have no idea maybe it's way your answer bro oh yeah I can change my answer new
(28:14) information how about that you got It's your information how is it new the next one is divorce hurts men
(28:21) marriage is pointless what that literally the opposite of my
(28:26) message no well he's saying that's one of the reasons how the show is not a dating podcast
(28:33) when we talk about divorce you're actively promoting people you're actively saying why should men get married that's a common talk in point no
(28:40) I usually ask why secular men should why should anybody get married this is super important so this I don't even think you
(28:47) would argue that this is isn't dating related so the span and spectrum between
(28:52) religious and the religious who want to get married in their preferences and secularists who want to get married in their preferences like [ __ ] night and
(28:57) day and so I always draw this parallel out when I ask religious people why do
(29:02) you want to get married right especially religious women and then you hear this answer right you know I want to fulfill
(29:09) my obligations to God or I want to you know live a certain lifestyle which is based on my ethical system that's why I
(29:15) want to get married you ask secularist women why you want to get married and often times they'll give you a whole
() 
(29:20) complete class list of uh I want more resources or I would like security or
(29:27) they're not unreasonable right but they definitely have a completely distinct
(29:32) distinction in opinion for why they want to get married that is I don't even think you could disagree that that's
(29:38) 100% valid for dating talking about marriage is fine discouraging it is not when when do I ever This podcast
(29:44) discourages marriage all the time when When have I ever discouraged marriage i didn't say you did i said this podcast i
(29:50) have always maintained to try to throw you like as much banal ranch as I can i've always maintained that to me I
(29:57) can't create justifications for secular marriage well by the way we're also talking about Red Pill Manosphere myron
(30:02) Gaines is also someone else another popular He also can't create so I've had conversations with Myron about this okay
(30:09) he also is in the same boat that I am in that for secularist men because what my says is from the religious standpoint
(30:15) makes sense especially if there's an ecclesiastical authority which can help govern it right um but he's the same
(30:21) like from the secularist standpoint justifying it for men is very difficult when he's talking about not getting
(30:26) married he never caveats it about being secular he says why would men get married they don't get anything out of it it's stupid this is the same message
(30:33) that Red Pill content creators are promoting to their people and that's why they are seeking that's why they're alone and that's why they're isolated
(30:39) some ground here that um he probably does talk like that but he's a secularist okay so when he's when he's
(30:47) referencing men right he's thinking of it from that view what does Andrew Tate think about marriage again what does
(30:53) that have to do with Myron Gaines one at a time don't pivot don't red her wait and also I just want to come in here
(30:59) andrew Wilson is not Andrew Tate so why is Andrew doing a defense of Andrew Tate he's doing a defense of Red Pill
(31:05) Manosphere content and that they are content creators of that i'm fine i'm fine doing this so
(31:12) uh Andrew Tate is looking at things also from the perspective of um Muslim and um
(31:18) he's looking at things from he has a like a variance perspective that's kind of interesting
(31:24) um discouraging i actually understand why it is that secularists discourage
(31:30) marriage for men uh that makes sense to me and I actually understand why it is that Tate would discourage uh marriage
(31:38) for men as well that also makes sense to me but since his conversion he actually
(31:43) seems to discourage it less but says instead that there needs to be reforms and changes to the way that the laws are
(31:48) done so that men don't take as much risk in marriage okay okay so going back to my opening statement three of the
(31:54) biggest podcasts that promote Red Pill content whatever Fresh and Fit and Andrew Tate most of them this excluding
(32:00) you and Jim Bob discourage marriage typically so that's my point that I've been making this whole time that you
(32:06) guys this these content creators are discouraging men and women from getting together because it benefits them but I
(32:11) need you to tell me this now okay i'm going to actually concede this point so that you can tell me why the [ __ ] that's
(32:18) bad for men do you think men shouldn't get together with women i have no I would love to hear your justifications
(32:24) for why it is that secularist men ought to get married to secularist women go
(32:30) ahead i think that red pill men especially the incelss of the world 95%
(32:35) of them report severe depression and they're lonely so these kinds of podcasts promote people being alone and
() 
(32:42) that is dangerous to men you're right but have you looked at the unaliving
(32:47) rates for divorced men they're high but you know how much higher 80% of all on
(32:54) the lives 80% of all on the lives are men 80% of all on the lives are men and by the way why didn't you throw in uh
(33:00) because you're only giving one side of this right i've read probably all of these studies in fact you can give me
(33:06) the list i bet you I have you have the list here's what's interesting in the study that you're citing specifically
(33:12) especially when it comes to unaliving studies yeah especially when it comes to unaliving which demographic unalives the
(33:17) most it's those who cohabitate the cohabitating men who are
(33:22) unmarried right they actually unal alive more than the men who are married or the
(33:29) men who aren't married including these depressed men and cohabitation seems to be like kind of the number one thing
(33:35) that secularists push right go ahead and cohabitate you can go ahead and live together there's no reason for you to
(33:40) have any type of moral standards there's no reason for you not to go ahead and move in with with your girlfriend that's
(33:46) what they push do you know who's getting married more right now than anybody any other demographic who college educated
(33:53) people yeah that's true mostly secularists so I don't know what you're talking about they're not secularists
(33:58) aren't pushing don't get married what does that have to do with anything this idea that you're saying secularists have this non-moral code where they're saying
(34:04) just cohabitate it doesn't matter that's not what's happening because they're actually getting married yeah because women who are in college have access to
(34:11) much higher status men than women who aren't in college college educated people are also getting divorce less yes
(34:17) because you have the high status man that you want who has lots and lots of money yes that's the way that works the
(34:25) women are also making a lot of money do you know how No not No so here's the thing that's so funny here's what you
(34:30) what you didn't include here so when it comes to the middle right you're right that the the middle class which I would
(34:35) argue you're saying I'm right a lot which which probably doesn't exist right i appreciate you saying I'm right the thing that's so fun about making a
() 
(34:42) concession to a point is that it makes it easier for me to destroy it so here's what's funny about this you are correct
(34:48) that the middle class does get divorced a bit less or I'm sorry get married a bit less right um in some cases a lot
(34:56) less depending on depending on what's going on but here's why you can only usually get a guy or a woman based
(35:03) around the social dynamics and social circle that you're in right sure they don't they only have access to women or
(35:09) men who are roughly making around the same amount or not the same amount as them and usually they meet them at work
(35:15) college educated women different now they have access to this kind of wider pool of much more wealthy men right and
(35:21) so yeah of course of course they marry them more often they have a higher status there for them to go after that's
(35:27) why they do that i like how you think women are just going after high status men when they make up 45% of the workforce 43% of entrepreneurs they're
(35:34) making their own money in Can you tell me though what the disparity is between the amount of money that these college
(35:39) educated women make compared to their college educated husbands sir I'm not sure but yeah you're not sure i'm not
(35:45) sure oh that's such a shock well let me tell you cuz I am sure right a significant It's a significant amount
(35:53) give me a number then if you know so much number because I don't remember if it's between I don't remember if it's between.5 or one but it's at least at
(36:01) least.5 more okay at least okay so like I don't I don't even know what you're
(36:07) here yeah i'm arguing here that secularists still get married and you're making the stupid point that they're promoting cohabitation even though
(36:12) that's not I would say that if it were the case that the middle class had access to the same amount of wealth as
(36:18) the college educated women do that they would be getting married at the same rates to those men okay okay well why aren't they getting married then because
(36:24) they don't have access to those men okay can you tell me why that's wrong i think
(36:30) No you can't can you cuz it makes sense doesn't it i'm about to why do you think there's such a gulf between relationships right now that you
(36:36) actually encourage i don't what golf do I encourage you encourage it on Pearl Davis's show just this week what that
(36:42) the golf she said men and women are dating you said good yeah no no no no are you serious yeah yeah you're You're
(36:48) going to lie right here right in front in front of my face i don't think I did say that yes you did you said it's good because they're going to No I'll tell
() 
(36:54) you what you said you said they're going to hold out because you think women are going to cave first so that we could start creating these gender roles again
(37:00) ah yes so you're talking about my internal critique of Pearl Davis pearl Davis said men and women aren't dating
(37:05) and you said good and this is why it's good that's not an internal critique this is why it's good that's not internal critique yes it was the entire
(37:11) conversation with Pearl was an internal critique that specific conversation was not an internal critique the whole
(37:17) conversation was an internal critique that's a That's a very likely story it's not only a like but listen do you do am
(37:22) I do I am I a person who debates utilizing internal critiques sure yeah and do I use that am I do I have a
(37:28) staple for utilizing internal critiques sure okay why is it though that for some reason you think with Pearl Davis I
(37:34) wouldn't use internal throughout the I will admit throughout the podcast you were but this specific point you weren't
(37:39) this was this was your own personal belief that it's a good thing that men and women are dating because you only want Christian people dating you only
(37:45) want Christian people dating and having babies suck and go [ __ ] themselves my point there if I now this is off the top
(37:51) of my head right and I think it's unfair for you to hold me to the standard of this debate that I had that went on for
(37:57) hours i can't remember every detail of it but if I remember this correctly what actually happened there was we were
(38:03) discussing secular marriage and if the gulf got too wide right then people are going to divert themselves over to other
(38:10) ex thing but I don't remember had nothing to do with secular it's like you keep throwing that word in front of what these people are saying because it just
(38:16) helps your argument but that's not what you guys were discussing you're talking about men and women aren't dating you admit that men and women are dating
(38:21) currently that it's Do you know men 18 to 24 never ask a woman out in real life did you know that
(38:27) no well no that's not correct okay correct me then yeah no show me show me the show me any data that shows that in
(38:33) your packet it's probably not in that packet because it's not true okay then what's the what's the statistically i don't have to give you a counter i just
(38:39) can tell you that that's not true unless you demonstrate demonstrate it okay i'm the one who actually brought something did you bring Did you bring any
(38:45) demonstrate any statistic you've thrown out what statistic have I thrown out demonstrate any statistic you've thrown out what statistic have I thrown out
(38:51) about how much more men in college make than their their wife counterparts you demanded that I give you a number what did I say i don't actually
(38:59) significantly know other than it's significant the gap well then show me the proof of that yeah I don't that's all I [ __ ] up yeah so here here just
(39:06) real quick just demonstrate it demonstrate it i got your data packet let me ask you something are men and
(39:12) women dating less hold on if you got to answer his question answer questions
(39:18) hold on if you're going to cross-examine him he's going to cross i asked him initially how many people are dating
(39:24) answered most of your question what was the question he said "You've asked a bunch of You've shotguned a bunch of
(39:30) questions he asked you a question back you should respond." Oh my god this [ __ ] room is cooking can you open that door up it is pretty hot in here
(39:36) yeah it's [ __ ] cooking both of them holy [ __ ] this is like peak bad
(39:43) dude all right it's It's got to be like a [ __ ] 100 degrees in this room dude
(39:48) uh so anyway where were we what were we talking about i asked about men and women dating and the gulf between them
(39:54) yeah what about it do you admit that that's happening that there's a gulf between dating yeah
(40:00) that men and women are dating less by in general what does that mean what are you asking me do you think men and women are
(40:07) dating less yes or no yes and you think that's a good thing
(40:14) um contextually it could be a good thing what do you mean by contextually well it
(40:19) could be that people are selecting for better better mates for instance and so they're dating less because they have
(40:24) much more criteria for them to go off of maybe it you could possibly see these results of that less single motherhood
(40:31) there could it could be a good thing do you think there are more in involuntary celibate men than ever
(40:37) no you think this is definitely not you think this is not an anomaly that's happening right now no when when else in
(40:43) history do you think that was happening so throughout most of history only about 40% of men ever reproduced and we know
(40:48) this because of we can we can check our ancestry and see how many more uh female
(40:54) ancestors than male we have so yeah most men were not able to reproduce they were expendable they were used as soldiers
(41:00) used as this used as that uh so no actually resources to reprod
(41:05) yeah you'll concede that point right so yeah I don't think that this is like So you don't think there's a golf in the
(41:11) mail loneliness thing you don't think that's a real thing yeah well I didn't say that though what did I actually say no I'm asking do you think it's So what
(41:18) I actually said was I do I do think it is the case that no you are incorrect
(41:23) and that this is not the worst it's ever been i would say that the interpersonal sexual dynamics might be the worst
(41:28) they've ever been but I also think that feminism and single mom caused that that's an interesting Why do you think
(41:35) that caused it because all the stats show that uh every single rate that you can imagine a metric which is horrific
() 
(41:42) on young men uh usually comes from single mother homes we're talking everything from homelessness on up um
(41:49) are almost everything is another term for single mother homes fatherless homes sure so why do you put it on women
(41:56) because it's usually women who initiate being in the fatherless relationship not men and why do they initiate being in a fatherless relationship the number one
(42:02) answer from women is that uh irreconcilable differences so do you know anyone in a woman in your life has
(42:09) ever been divorced sure do they say "Hey we got divorced because we couldn't reconcile our differences." Or do they
(42:14) say another reason uh usually well I mean they they have all sorts of reasons yeah but they don't
(42:20) say we couldn't reconcile our differences right yeah yeah that's true but what's your point why do you use that as a reason women are That's the
(42:26) reason they give is irreconcilable that's the reason they give in court but what do they give in real life what's
(42:31) the real reason they have a varying varying uh degree of things but here's what's not happening what they're not
(42:37) actually giving in real life is he was abusing me he was beating me up he was doing this he was doing that you know
(42:44) the top three reasons women file for divorce infidelity emotional neglect and poor communication followed by finances
(42:51) what's the top three though that's the top three I just said no it's not yes it is no the top three is not infidelity
(42:56) yes infidelity emotional neglect and poor communication followed by finances oh so what's the number one reason i
() 
(43:02) just said fidelity infidelity i just said that infidelity is number one reason correct okay which one of these studies proves that did you bring any
(43:09) studies just tell me which You know what don't say any facts for the rest of this debate if you're not going to show me a study how about that bro listen don't
(43:15) show No more facts no more facts you got to stop interrupting him every time you
(43:21) literally were interrupting his boy yeah you did did I make the claim or did you It's called Yo it's called moderating
(43:28) the show you've been interrupting the entire time if Andrew interrupts you I'll say the same thing to him yeah but
(43:33) just real quick um did you make the claim or did I make the claim i made the claim okay great can you show it i don't
(43:39) have the data point in front of me but I looked it up prior to this and you can do it after okay what if we do it now do
(43:45) go for it sure and where can I find this data i around
(43:51) yeah you looked it up i have a lot of data man i don't know exactly each source I got from
(44:01) this is more about single mothers you can look at that one if you want to talk about single motherhood yeah we can get
(44:07) into that but again this is just wild to me i thought I thought you were going to tell me that that was the number one
(44:13) reason okay well you can't use any facts if you don't have any data the number one reason that I'm seeing is lack of commitment well that's infidelity and
(44:19) also and also emotional neglect okay what does lack of commitment mean to you Andrew i have no idea what it means you
(44:25) tell me that's not infidelity right because infidelity doesn't show a lack of commitment does infidelity show a
(44:31) lack of commitment so not coming home by [ __ ] 10 what what are you talking
(44:36) about so tell me what does that mean lack of commitment you tell me i You're the one who made the claim you're the
(44:42) one who said it was irreconcilable differences that's the number one reason they file divorces is right but that's not the reason people actually file for
(44:48) divorce okay so the reasons that they give you're saying that the number one reason women women give is infidelity
(44:55) infidelity emotional neglect and poor communication okay where can I find the statistics i don't remember man i I
(45:01) brought all the statistics you didn't bring any i didn't need to bring any yeah cuz you're making [ __ ] up what am I making up anything you say cuz I can you
(45:08) can't prove it what have I said that I made up about the the finances that did how do I make something up when I say I don't know for sure okay well you said
(45:14) it's significant that is true it is significant okay well how can you prove that well what does significant mean uh
(45:20) let's see statistically let's just see if we can find this i am not seeing infidelity is
(45:27) number one answer on any of these okay
(45:33) um [Music] Number one reason I'm seeing is financial problems that's not the number
(45:39) one reason and you've also said it's not the number one reason that's what I'm seeing okay but I'm ready for a
(45:44) counterfactual okay fine let's just concede that I don't know what I'm talking about the point is it's not irreconcilable differences people file
(45:50) for a reason well we're talking past each other because you we were talking about divorce and I said that that they
(45:56) file for irreconcilable differences you asked for the meaning behind the irreconcilable difference i'm fine with
(46:01) that i just don't think it's infidelity i think that's incorrect and when I just looked it is you made the claim that it
(46:07) is but you can't tell me where I You're blaming women for filing for divorce making it sound like it's just some fly
(46:13) by the night thing they decided to do there's typically a reason and you read something i'm not saying that there's not reasons okay the question then why
(46:20) do you blame women for single mother the question The question is whether or not there's good Well first of all can you be a single mother and never be married
(46:26) sure but where's the father in this scenario yeah well here's the thing don't courts adjust towards women even
() 
(46:32) when they aren't married do you know one in three children born out of wedlock don't see their father past the age of
(46:38) three did you know that why you tell me i'm I'm I'm waiting no
(46:45) you tell me if you Why do I need to tell you when I ask you a question why because single motherhood is not just a female problem okay but why do they not
(46:52) have access to Because men tend to abandon children can you demonstrate that
(46:58) i think I just did how 33% of children don't see their father past age three
(47:03) but that doesn't prove that it's because the men don't want to okay how many men
(47:08) file for custody of the child in a in child court uh I don't know the stats off the top of
(47:14) my head we can look 95% of them are filed uh without contest from the father and the 4% that do typically do get it
(47:21) so if 95% of men aren't fighting for their child I think you can look at men for the problem oh I see okay so let's
(47:26) back up um tell me something who can actually have children
(47:32) men or women women okay are these women being raped no okay so they have uh the
(47:39) responsibility of making sure that they don't get pregnant right i think two people have the responsibility to make
(47:46) sure they don't get somebody pregnant as Do you agree with me that it is the case that most men will sleep with most women
(47:54) but most women won't sleep with most men so what so if that's the case right then
(47:59) women have greater access than men do don't they sure so So if that's the case
(48:04) why are they granting access to men who abandon their kids how do they know they're going to abandon their kids well
(48:10) hang on that's so weird though wait a second let's back up mhm they they're the ones who have the sexual access
(48:16) right so if they don't if they don't know why are they sleeping with these men they're the ones who get pregnant
(48:22) not the men and men are the ones that get them pregnant yeah so what they're a part of the equation so what that's a
(48:29) part of the equation yeah but women are the ones who get to access that and men are the ones that access it okay can men
(48:35) can men have abortions no can men force women to have abortions no do you believe women should be able to have
(48:40) abortions well if that's the case right that you believe women's women ought to be able to have abortions men ought not
(48:47) to have any say on whether or not women have abortions then women are the ones who ultimately have 100% access around
(48:53) reproduction not men so men have no responsibility in your eyes how could they have a responsibility if they're not allowed to make the choice of if the
(48:59) child's even here or not if you got somebody pregnant would you abandon them do I form a secular worldview or do I form a Christian one do Christian people
(49:07) abandon their children no no they don't all All Christians are perfect no no no no under Christian ethics you're not to
(49:13) abandon your children sure okay so only secular people abandon their children no that's not what I said what did I just
(49:18) say christian ethics bans you from Under Christian ethics you're ought not do that right is ought not the same as do
(49:25) they don't should anyone do that do Do I think so yeah under Christian ethics no
(49:30) even secular do you think people should even if you're secular Christian ethics i don't think secular people should and I think secular people also don't think
(49:36) they should abandon their children so what's the point but they can kill them i don't think it's killing oh I know
() 
(49:41) right so you don't think it's killing no it's not it's not okay got it they say kill them but they think that they
(49:47) shouldn't have it's a horrible framing that's a horrible a great compelling reason here if the idea is that um that
(49:54) these women they're get they're getting knocked up they're the ones who have complete and total access to who sleeps
(50:00) with them they're not getting raped and they have the choice as to whether or not they abort or not abort yeah
(50:07) but someone also wasn't but does the man have a choice the man was the man has a choice to not impregnate a woman now the
(50:13) man has a choice to not Does the man have the choice to keep the baby not if the woman does the man have the
(50:18) choice to make the woman pay him child support and keep the baby how much is the average child support can you answer my question i just went no answer my
(50:26) [ __ ] I just I just said no okay okay let's back up how about then how about you listen yeah yeah okay let's back up
(50:32) well I said can you answer my question and you said no you can see how I could perceive that as you saying I'm not
(50:37) going to answer your question right yes no even the moderator thought that was the case okay so let's back up you do
(50:43) believe that it is the case that men can't force women to have their children correct but women can force men to take
(50:52) care of their children that's correct okay how is that fair i'm not saying it's fair okay so then what is the ins
(50:59) so then if men didn't want to have that child why should they be held to account take care of it because it's their child
(51:06) what because it is their child i'm super confused but they didn't have a say doesn't matter it's their child should
(51:12) they be able to have a say i don't think so but you just said it's not fair yeah
(51:19) it's not fair so what they had a child that's their child they should take care of it and not abandon it so okay so to get this right then women should be able
(51:26) to kill men's children if they want right stop framing it as killing or hang
(51:31) on or keep them if they want and the man has to pay child support for the child that's correct right that's correct and
(51:36) and you think women should get to make that choice 100% why should we let the women make that choice because they're the ones that have to you know conceive
(51:43) so Got it so they're the ones have to conceive so they're the ones making the choice yep so therefore it's their
(51:49) responsibility anything else no because the the father is also part of the responsibility wait I I'm sorry who's
(51:55) making the choice they can have the child but the father should take care of their child and you don't disagree with
(52:00) that do you do you disagree with me or not do you disagree with the from a secular angle why not because it makes
(52:07) no sense to me it makes total sense if you have a child you should take care of it well let's try this again i just walked you through the logic though [ __ ]
(52:12) the logic i'm asking you do you think Do you think a secular person should take care of the child that they have does a
(52:18) Christian think that of course and you don't think secular people do well I can't see how a secularist could justify
() 
(52:24) it no not if you're making the claim so you made the claim here from my worldview if you have a child you should
(52:29) take care of it period why because that's my worldview why though because it's your child you are part of it i
(52:34) don't need to justify it for you because when we walk around the logic here's what we end up with you say women have complete and total access should be able
(52:40) to kill a man's kid right or should be able to bring it to bear and make sure that the man takes care of the kid but
(52:48) the man can't tell the woman that she has to have the kid even when she's pregnant right that's correct and if
(52:53) there's a child in the world that that man contributed to he should take care of it okay so just to make sure that we got this right it's an uneven standard
(53:00) for men versus women if that's the world we live in yeah so justify why it is that men shouldn't say [ __ ] that i don't
(53:06) need to okay well then when you ask me Andrew don't you think X and I say well
(53:12) you say I can't say from a secular point of view i say from a secular point of view I actually can't answer the
(53:17) justification just remember that neither can you and I would say most secular people also believe you should take care of a child if you're the one from the
(53:23) Christian ethical angle of course of course you're supposed to take care of your children but from the Christian ethical angle it's also completely
(53:29) appropriate right to put significant pressure on women to not have abortions meaning men get a say in the choice
(53:35) right well what's wild to me is that you're complaining about single motherhood and then you're sitting here saying "Well men should say [ __ ] it."
(53:40) Which is just wild that men should say [ __ ] it if they want what did I say when you said so men should say [ __ ] it right
(53:46) i'm sorry do you know what an ought versus a descriptor what's an ought ant is I don't know did
(53:53) I say that secular men ought do that or did I say I can't I can't think of a justification you can't think of a
(53:58) justification neither can you but you also don't think single motherhood is a good thing correct that's correct so why
(54:03) don't you encourage men to take care of the children should we force them to i think so okay so you think that we
(54:10) should force men to take care of the kids correct that's what child support is but no no no no no that's not Well
(54:18) that is true that they take it by force I guess yeah that's what you said but what I'm talking about force is like
(54:24) should we make them participate as a father yes we should force that and so
(54:30) as long as the court rules that they should yes no that's that's different i'm not asking about what the court
(54:36) rules i'm asking do you think we should force men to participate i think they should force at least child support and
(54:42) if No that's not my question well that's what I'm saying should they force men to participate in being a father being a
(54:49) father no no no no no not at the father if the father is going to be a shitty
(54:54) father then no then can you explain to me how it is that if the woman can get
(55:00) child support from the guy right and you were not going to force any participation aren't you pushing single
(55:07) motherhood no you're blaming women for single motherhood and and you're you're saying they're the ones who have all the
(55:12) choice by your own admission but the fathers have no part to play in it and in single motherhood fathers have no part fathers can't make the
(55:18) determination as to whether or not they can even have the kid and only the woman can you you hold an uneven playing field
(55:25) i have at least a consistent view that women should not be allowed to abort and men ought to actually be made to
(55:31) participate in their own children's life that's my consistent worldview your worldview is inconsistent okay you're
(55:40) making said that if a man has a child you're just giving privilege to women if Sure if a man has a child they should
(55:46) take care of it do they that's a different story i'm saying they should if women have children should they take care of it can they give it up for
(55:52) adoption sure okay can the man make the woman give or why can't the man give up
(55:57) his parental rights and just walk away if the woman can if the woman does then he can well wait that's really weird i
(56:05) don't get it if it is the case that the mother has guardianship of the father's
(56:10) child she can still put the child up for adoption right sure okay but he can't if
(56:16) he has guardianship of the child he can't if he has guardianship well so he can too but if she's a single mom what
(56:21) gives him guardianship well he doesn't have guardianship i'm saying if if if a father has guardianship he can also put
(56:27) up the child for adoption it's not just a mother yeah but who does it default to why does it default to women because
(56:32) that's the way the system is set how is it set that way because it's it it has become matrinal rather than patrineal
(56:39) what does that mean what does that mean it means from the father from the mother no I know the definition you always need those words but why is the family court
(56:47) why is it giving it because feminists have made huge pushes in order to make it that way feminists have pushed that
(56:53) women get custody of the child are most judges in family court men or
(56:58) women in family court they're men and so they're influenced by feminists i'm sorry wait a second are you saying that
(57:05) men can't be feminists i'm saying that I doubt that the majority of family court Are you saying that men can't be feminist i'm saying that I doubt all the
(57:12) family court judges are so influenced by family court judges have to adhere to the law or do they make the law i'm not
(57:19) sure if they make the law or not they have to adhere to the law they don't make it right yeah so family court judges are just adhering to the law
(57:24) right and what's the law say yeah the law you So here's what happened we used to have what are called kovature laws
(57:30) covature laws actually forced men to take care of their families that very same thing that you want right of course
(57:36) this also made children their property and women right were also part of the man then right that was how it went but
(57:43) guess what they had to take care of their family or they went to [ __ ] jail that's what happened marriages stayed together about 90 95% and you
(57:50) know what happened feminists really pushed real [ __ ] hard for the average default laws and here's what the average
(57:56) default laws were oh the average default laws were saying basically on average
(58:02) the default is going to go to women right now there's a whole series of laws I can pull up and go through but yes
(58:08) this was pushed by feminists so that there was default laws which pushed pushed literally that women default by
(58:16) default had custody yes that is correct that is not how it works because if a father if a father tries to get custody
(58:23) of the child they often do get it but but most so feminists have failed then no bro there's been since men's rights
(58:30) movement started especially in about the mid200s there have been reforms to the laws male custody has quadrupled because
(58:38) of men's rights advocacy groups and yes quadrupled and yes I can grab you that stat if you want i'm not saying it has
(58:45) quadrupled because these laws have now begun to get rolled back but it used to
(58:50) actually just be a straight default a straight default how long because I my understanding of this is most fathers
(58:57) aren't filing for custodial guardianship of the child you're talking you have to understand that you're looking at it
(59:03) from a historic prism that doesn't make any sense you're talking about modern laws and the way that modern custody
(59:10) arrangements happen it wasn't always this case the case used to be actually that children went to the men that was
(59:17) the that was the old laws under coverture laws right that changed with feminism and radical feminism pushing
(59:24) for those laws to be changed so you're saying there was a time when the children were raised there were more single fathers than single mothers no
(59:31) there just wasn't really any erosion of marriage okay then why did you say that why did you make that point you made the point that back in the day men were
(59:38) getting custody of the children but then there were still more single mothers no there wasn't very many single mothers
(59:44) either okay but they outnumbered the single fathers no there wasn't there you listen these marriages stayed together
(59:51) but under the law it was true under the kovature laws that the child was the property or was at least associative
(59:58) property to the father yes i'm glad we're having this discussion cuz it goes back to the point that I've been trying to make that can you explain though your
() 
(1:00:04) logic there i'm trying to understand the logic no I I want to get back to the thing we're talking about no no I want to get back to the thing we're talking
(1:00:09) about hang on hang on i'm not hanging on it's not about escaping before I let you escape I just want to get back to this logic this is the point that I'm trying
(1:00:16) to make why would it be that there was more hang on stop i don't want to i just want to finish i want to get back to the
(1:00:21) thing if you answer this last question I don't give a [ __ ] i want to get to the next thing why won't you answer my question because the whole point I've
(1:00:26) been trying to make this whole debate is any chance you get you blame women any chance you get you blame women single
(1:00:33) mothers for what for everything you blame women for the downfall of society what if it is that let me ask you this
(1:00:39) you blame Do you blame women for the downfall of society no I don't blame it for the downfall of society the current trend of society you don't no you never
(1:00:46) said that no what I blame women for specifically right is feminism and
(1:00:53) feminist Marxist ideology i do blame them for that yes okay and as you said feminism is the reason there's so many
(1:00:58) single mothers right i think it's a core reason yeah okay so is that contributed to the downfall of society sure so
(1:01:04) through that logic women are contributing to the downfall of society yeah but men would also be contributing the downfall of society okay so you
(1:01:10) blame women mostly for the downfall of society you blame feminism yes the ideology of feminism which I'm blaming
(1:01:16) the ideology so you're just asking about the execution it's like are you blaming men for the downfall of society of a
(1:01:24) society which is mostly communist or would you be blame because they're enforcing everything or would you be
(1:01:29) blaming the ideology you're blaming women can you answer my question no you're blaming women you're not blaming
(1:01:35) the ideology because women are the ones who So I'm going to ask the question again until you answer it okay so you
(1:01:40) have a communist country right and the men are are doing most of the bad stuff in the communist country would you blame
(1:01:46) the men or would you blame communism i don't think feminism can answer my [ __ ] question answer the question yes
(1:01:52) or no you don't know i don't know i don't know okay start answering that i don't know because you're saying feminism the ideology in its own
(1:01:59) feminism the ideology on it you lived in a communist country and it was mostly the men enforcing the communism you
(1:02:06) don't know if you'd blame the men or the ideology really you don't know i' I'd probably blame the men at that point you blame the Okay well then then So you're
(1:02:13) saying that I should blame women no I'm saying that you do i blame the ideology no you're blaming the women every chance
(1:02:19) you get the only consistent thing you could actually say here would be I blame
(1:02:25) communism for the way these men are behaving unless you innately think men are bad what about feminism unless you innately
(1:02:31) think ma men are bad what about feminism is bringing about the downfall of society you mean what what is it contributing to
(1:02:38) yeah it's not just contributing to single motherhood it also contributes to these two-income households it's
(1:02:43) contributing to well it contributes to the fact that we even need two inome households but one of the major things
(1:02:48) it contributes to is taking mothers out of the home that's the biggest way that it contributes to the downfall of
(1:02:54) society is taking mothers out of the home don't you agree i don't agree but this this goes to the point that I said
(1:03:01) how does this change what I said that you blame feminism for the downfall of society it well you didn't say that you said I said I said that initially and I
(1:03:06) said that in my opening statement as well blame women who who implemented feminism yeah so well that was a bunch
(1:03:12) of rich corporatists and then and then it was also a lot of women who were in bed with No it really was it was rich
(1:03:17) corporatist was it men that implemented feminism it was both okay yeah it was both but what do you think I But back to
(1:03:24) this I just I just want to make sure right why would it like how would it even track that I would blame women for
(1:03:32) the I or or hate women i'm sorry hate women i do blame them if they're
(1:03:37) feminists for holding that ideology but that's not all women that's not me hating women you made the distinction
(1:03:44) earlier that if I hate an individual woman that's not that's not misogyny
(1:03:49) right i wouldn't say on an individual level no yeah so then if I hate all feminists
(1:03:56) that's only hating individuals with an ideology right if most women are feminist wouldn't that be misogynistic
() 
(1:04:01) i'm not sure that most women Well I don't know that's hard to say but if it
(1:04:07) is the case no actually even if it was the case that most women were feminists and you hated fe all all women who were
(1:04:14) feminists you still wouldn't hate women you would only hate feminists that's an easy way out of that one well I mean it's true though right no no it's not
(1:04:20) true okay then explain the logic to me because if women are feminists and you hate feminism then you hate women no no
(1:04:26) you hate feminism okay yeah so here's the thing and I can prove it i hate men
(1:04:32) who are feminists too oh you're looking at one yeah so so here's the thing if that's the case then would that make me
(1:04:39) a misandress i don't think so what if most men were feminists which you said
(1:04:45) it's about 80% so then I hate 80% of men by that logic so I'm a misandress right
(1:04:51) if you hate them for that for that yeah sure okay so then I'm a misandress and a misogynist then yeah you hate So I just
(1:04:57) [ __ ] hate everybody i mean I wouldn't say most [ __ ] hate everybody i wouldn't say most men are feminist you
(1:05:03) said 80% i I'm granting your hypothetical you weren't granting a hypothetical you I asked you the question you said 80% agree with me no I
(1:05:10) don't think men I don't think 80% of men are feminists okay how many i don't know i have no idea i'll throw out a number
(1:05:16) i'll say maybe 30% 30% yeah and how many women um I have no idea maybe 80 so a
(1:05:23) lot more and you think that that shouldn't come up during a dating talk huh i'm not saying it should i'm saying
(1:05:28) that you feminism which which by default you blame women so if women are in the workplace men and women are so
(1:05:35) ideologically split on like almost a a like a 60/20 playing field you don't think that's pertinent to dating i'm not
(1:05:42) saying that i'm saying that you blame feminism for the downfall of society i not not just feminism okay yeah but I do
(1:05:49) blame feminists for their part of the downfall of society yeah including going to work including going to college
(1:05:54) including all No idea of separating mothers from children that was the worst idea by going to work and going to
(1:06:00) college and that's a that's a terrible idea right don't you think it's a better Who well like why is it a better idea
(1:06:08) for you to send your kid to away from you to like a [ __ ] nanny or something
(1:06:13) to raise the kid instead of you how's that better i don't know move on you don't know well
(1:06:20) you can do you want to give a response before just cuz cuz it's not [ __ ] better is it i'm not going to get into
(1:06:26) that yeah cuz it's not better is it i'm not going to get into it yeah cuz it's Is it better though is it better is it
(1:06:32) better to send your kid off the [ __ ] Canuela who knows maybe it's better for that family i have no idea you You're making these big broad generalizations
(1:06:38) about how life should know do you think maybe for some families average that it would be better if mothers raise their children or
(1:06:45) outsource the raising of their children they're not outsourcing it maybe it's for part of the day Andrew they're outsourcing that's not outsourcing it
(1:06:50) because there's still the rest of the day okay so how much time on average is it that you think that mothers are
(1:06:56) spending with their children in comparison to how much they used to spend with their children before they were in the workforce i have no idea you don't know no what if it What about
(1:07:03) throwing one of those numbers out what would you What would you think well how about this how about just make it easy more or less less less they're spending
(1:07:11) less time with them now right do you think that that's good i think each individual family has their own do you
(1:07:17) think that that's good i think each individual family has their own you think it's good for society others are spending less you think okay got it got
(1:07:24) it well we'll come back to that we do need to let a couple chats come through we have quite a few who have collected
(1:07:29) so we have Nasha Nabu thank you appreciate it nashu Nabu donated
(1:07:37) $200 the lead attorney a divorce attorney speaks on why men do not fight
() 
(1:07:42) for their kids judges go off precedent because of this lawyers tell fathers not
(1:07:47) to fight for their kids because they lose h you know I don't even I don't even
(1:07:53) want to grant that like I don't even think you need to grant it if the idea is just that women are completely in
(1:08:00) charge of all reproductive rights period um and you can't justify why men need to
(1:08:05) take care of their [ __ ] kids then who gives a [ __ ] if I can respond to that um quick response if you can yeah the
(1:08:11) majority of fathers that do contest tend to get uh their child at least in modern
(1:08:16) times okay uh Nshu appreciate that we have uh son coming in thank you offson
(1:08:23) donated $100 thank you this guy is a hypocrite critiquing Andrew for pushing
(1:08:29) a world view when he does himself this guy can't make any prescriptive statements he is a progressive feminist
(1:08:37) this reduces to Emma preferences to my preferences yeah my I came here to say
(1:08:42) let's try to get men and women dating again but we ended up talking about single motherhoods okay well let's let's get into that let's get let's go let's
(1:08:48) get through a few more chats but we can come back to it um uh son appreciate that we have stream thank you man stream
(1:08:56) rift donated $100 women will lie cheat and steal to hurt a father by fighting over custody
(1:09:04) the question shouldn't be why men don't fight for their kids it's why do single moms make them fight to begin with if
(1:09:11) you care about your kids you'll fight for them i don't care i don't care the obstacles because my opponent over here demonstrated it for you women should
(1:09:18) have the complete and total right over all men's children including the right to kill them and should be able to force
(1:09:23) them to pay support for those children long term and can't even justify why he can't even tell us give us a single
(1:09:29) reason why i I did give you a reason okay what if you have a child you should take care of it the reason because you
(1:09:34) should why because you should oh because you should because you should because you should exactly you should give me
(1:09:40) $100 okay well I won't yeah but if you said you but you should Okay you should
(1:09:45) Yeah but you should they should raise their children yeah but but why they should fight for their child why because it's their child why there doesn't need
(1:09:51) anymore that's a sentence you're just saying dude that doesn't that doesn't say anything yeah okay it doesn't say
(1:09:56) anything it says nothing father should just not take care of the children no but here's the thing that's interesting right it's like you're doing everything
(1:10:03) to enable women to kill men's children i don't agree with that framing but go for it well I mean here's the thing right
(1:10:09) can men say anything about it nope well then there's nothing there's no framing here to disagree with yeah it's not
(1:10:14) killing quick uh clarifying question for you just uh because it's come up a couple times do you want to just state your quick position on abortion are you
(1:10:21) pro pro-choice i'm not I'm here to talk about I'm pro choice but I'm not here to talk about abortion we don't have to get into abortion but that's what always
(1:10:27) happens on this show it's like we're here to talk about red pill manosphere and we're talking about abortion it's just really fascinating well there's a
(1:10:33) bunch of different pro Yeah when you ask when you ask a bunch of different questions and I test your logic and it moves into that what's unfair about that
(1:10:40) well it's because you lose the point of what we're here to talk about i'm not losing any points yeah you are you lose the point of what we're talking about
(1:10:45) this is what this this is why your debates take five hours is because you get into all these stupid little side arguments that don't go into what we
(1:10:51) talked about in our opening statement let's do it this way you ask a question I ask a question you answer I answer
(1:10:56) how's that and then we can't deter it you want to do it that way i I'm I'm following Brian's moderation i'm fine
(1:11:03) with that if you guys want to go back and forth you think I'm trying to be evasive with you no it's not evasive
(1:11:08) it's just that every time or maybe you just want a filibuster i have nothing about filibustering i'm You're doing most of the talking bro it's been pretty
(1:11:17) equal i think it's been Yeah you guys have both talked a good amount okay all right here we got more chats though then
(1:11:22) we'll get into some of the debate stuff we have Christopher thank you Christopher appreciate it christopher Scott donated $100 thanks man just
(1:11:30) because men don't file for custody doesn't mean they abandon their children there could be an agreement outside of
(1:11:36) court for shared custody that's fair but statistically more men abandon the children than women
(1:11:42) okay uh we have Jason Cassell thank you guys by the way if you want to get one
(1:11:47) in uh streamlabs.com/ whatever we're doing $100 the the thing is so funny about that is like but you advocate for
(1:11:55) a society where the women own the children so it's advocate for a society where women get to make the decision
() 
(1:12:00) whether or not they have a child so they own the child no they they own their pregnancy yeah so they so so they own
(1:12:05) the right over the life of the man's child literally by the they own a pregnancy and the father should take care of it after that but what if the
(1:12:11) man so but if the woman doesn't want to take care of it she gets out if the father doesn't want to take care of it he does not right correct so then the
(1:12:17) ownership of the child and life and death of the child and life and death of the father falls to the woman
(1:12:24) okay life's not fair Andrew so So don't you think women have a greater responsibility here for reproduction
(1:12:29) than men i think women have a responsibility for their pregnancy and then a father and a mother Hold on i'm
(1:12:35) talking and then the father and the mother have a responsibility to raise a child okay that's not my question repeat my question repeat my question yeah but
(1:12:41) that's my stance okay so I'm going to ask the question again then actually answer my question don't you think that if it is the case that you advocate that
(1:12:47) only women can have the right to terminate a pregnancy and that only women can have the right to bring it to
(1:12:52) bear and that affects the man's life and it affects the child's life but the sole decision is on her for reproduction why
(1:13:00) doesn't she have a greater responsibility to who she [ __ ] reproduces with why because the other
(1:13:06) person was involved just as much i don't know what to [ __ ] do with [ __ ] so
(1:13:11) stupid yeah it's stupid so way more so so she has way more privilege right way
(1:13:17) more privilege privilege yeah way more privilege but for some odd reason no
(1:13:22) greater no more no no not even equal responsibility like this [ __ ] wild to
(1:13:28) me yeah so let me just make sure well can you say it for me one more time say it for me one more time that women right
(1:13:35) even though they get to determine the pregnancy the entire time have no greater duty or responsibility for who
(1:13:42) they reproduce with correct even though they're the gatekeepers of reproduction because someone else was a part of that
(1:13:48) birth even though they're the gatekeepers of reproduction gatekeeper okay well they're the literally someone entered the gate Andrew don't they have
(1:13:53) a responsibility no they could just kill whoever came through whatever the result of that but someone walked through the
(1:13:58) [ __ ] gate right yeah how could I don't know how you can possibly uh make this claim consistent for me how do they
(1:14:05) not have a greater duty when they are the ones who can reproduce men can't reproduce and they don't have the option
(1:14:12) of saying no afterwards only women have the greater duty of the pregnancy and then after that the mother and the
(1:14:18) father should raise the child together that's my stance okay well let me ask you this no we're moving on do you think
(1:14:24) that in dating Oh no you Yeah go ahead do you think do you think in dating right that it would
(1:14:31) be like a really big deterrent if I knew that if I had sex with a woman even if I
(1:14:37) cared about her right and she got pregnant that I would have zero choice
(1:14:43) over the the health and welfare of my child but she would have 100% of the
(1:14:49) choice over that isn't that how it is today yeah so what's the difference yeah so so right now today don't you think
(1:14:56) that that would act as a massive deterrent in dating which is the thing you want men and women to do again what's what's changed about that when's
(1:15:03) when when hasn't that been the case when's the last time that wasn't the case what that women had the scenario yeah so before the 60s okay well people
(1:15:11) were still dating right yeah but do don't you think that abortion had an arc where previous generations were not as
(1:15:17) accustomed to it as they are now and before there wasn't that many people resisting it and now many many more we
(1:15:23) have the it's the age of the internet right so you don't think men are dating because they're afraid women are going to abort their child i would say do do
(1:15:29) you think do you think any reason is a monolithic one not necessarily no yeah so So I could have many reasons right
(1:15:36) yeah but you're asking about this one in particular yes that's right this one in particular do you think that that would cause incentive more incentive at least
(1:15:43) for men to be very wary of the dating market if it is the case that women can have the choice over the reproduction of
(1:15:50) their child no I don't why because it hasn't really changed that much since the 60s
(1:15:58) so I don't I I I really don't understand this it even if it is a case that boomers right who didn't really have to
() 
(1:16:05) deal with this problem as much as it's it's done i mean it's casual now it's casual like do you think in the 60s and
(1:16:11) 70s that women were female comedians were televising their abortion like Sarah Silverman no but you said it's
(1:16:18) more casual right yeah that their abort their their abortions are more casual and and sex is more casual too yes so
(1:16:25) that doesn't seem like much of a deterrent what do you mean guys are still banging sex correct the sex isn't
(1:16:31) a deterrent the sex is regardless of relationships if the sex is what causes the child Andrew the sex is what causes
(1:16:37) the child so if more casual sex is happening then it's not much of a deter if you're dating a woman is that casual sex no we're talking about sexual dating
(1:16:46) say the word it's obviously not if people are having casual sex I don't need to say your [ __ ] if people are
(1:16:51) having more casual sex then they're obviously not that deterred by the idea of this woman could terminate the pregnancy so I'm talking about dating
(1:16:58) i asked you about that word dating you say casual sex but then casual sex not dating so that you shouldn't logically
(1:17:05) put that in makes no sense so we're talking about dating do you think if you're dating a woman right that you
(1:17:11) would be deterred from dating the thing you want to do by the fact that she has complete and total control over
(1:17:16) reproduction no because I don't think men are avoiding dating because they're like "Oh man she might abort my child." But really but I thought you just said
(1:17:23) that there was an uptick in casual sex there is instead of dating not instead of dating i'm saying there's been casual
(1:17:29) sex for a long time is dating up or down dating is down is casual sex up or down it's about the same as it was probably
(1:17:35) whenever we were in college no okay no do you think that casual But even if
(1:17:41) that was the case dating is down casual sex the same so that mean would it still mean that people are having more casual
(1:17:47) sex than they're dating right yeah but I don't think they're not dating because they're afraid they're going to have a child you don't even think it could be
(1:17:52) possibly a contributing factor you wouldn't even grant a contributing factor no okay what about for the religious is it contributing factor for
(1:17:58) them i think they're probably not having premarital sex to begin with oh dude just because you're religious right you
(1:18:05) could you can still give into temptation right okay don't you think that would be a deterrent i think they're more abstinent
(1:18:12) than a lot of secular people sure but wouldn't it be a deterrent no no so because I don't think a
(1:18:19) religious person would get an abortion what the hell are you talking about what because you're religious the person
(1:18:24) you're dating has to be i I would imagine if you're dating a religious person you're probably religious too no
(1:18:30) that's not the case especially not for Christian men they date secular women constantly okay and it's a it's a fear
(1:18:36) they talk about often that hey if I slip up and she gets pregnant she can actually just take out my kid there's
(1:18:43) nothing I can do about it but I want to get which is why they they date less and less secular women trying to move more
(1:18:48) and more towards Christian women doesn't that lower the chance of dating
(1:18:53) no that doesn't okay i I know you want to ask a question we'll finish up the chats and you can uh ask the question
(1:18:59) here we have Jason Cassell oh really quick Kaibaka i don't know if you're still watching on Twitch it won't let me

(1:23:38) they call it the Asian flush okay yeah no I've heard of that mhm all right we have emotional damage i once knew a guy
(1:23:45) who talked uh Mary the just on the corner of the table here can I read this yeah go for it i once knew a guy talk
(1:23:52) like this dummy he's now divorced and happily broke while his wife is living in his house and driving his car he
(1:23:58) still feels content in his life because he gets to pay her can you take that one
(1:24:03) because he gets to pay her half of his salary lost custody of his kid such a proud feminist
(1:24:09) emotional damage good to see you in the chat thank you sad for that guy but I'm happily married and I don't see that as
(1:24:15) my outcome how long you've been married for uh coming up on 3 years together about
(1:24:21) eight or nine congratulations thank you there you go and may you have many children that your wife can determine
(1:24:26) whether she wants she wants to abort we don't want children but we're not worried about that that's not Why am I
(1:24:32) not shock are you an anti-natalist no no okay all right we have Lucas here uh it
(1:24:37) looks like there's a string of them one what the concept of submission outlined in Ephesians 5:22 wives submit
(1:24:45) yourselves to your own husband as you do to the Lord is not pertinent to interexual dynamics oh but wait only in
(1:24:53) your small circle Andrew that small circle representing 62% of the population of the US population this guy
(1:25:00) is a woke clown but let me guess Camala voter yes or did you vote definitely definitely voted Camala 100% sorry champ
(1:25:08) my wife and I vote MAGA unapologetically good-looking wife by the way lucas Lucas
(1:25:13) is uh you know he's he's going to have some good-looking kids yeah see he's married he watches the
(1:25:20) They watch the podcast together that's good do Would you say most of your audience is married most of mine is would you say I know I heard you say
(1:25:26) that would you say that she is a misogynist i won't i don't know anything about her is Lucas Let me caveat it it
(1:25:34) may not be most of them are married but most of them are in marriageable age and a significant portion is married okay
(1:25:40) well let me ask you this do you think of the content creators that we're talking about including the audience here would
(1:25:46) you say most of them are married in a relationship or would you say the majority aren't of the viewers yeah I
(1:25:52) haven't pulled them i wouldn't know do you have like I'll go ahead and grant probably the majority of them probably aren't married why would that matter i'm
(1:25:58) just or in a relationship i don't know i haven't pulled my audience i mean we're kind of about to reach a threshold soon
(1:26:04) where most of the population is not going to be married or in a relationship but the whole point that I'm trying to make is that I think Red Pill content is
(1:26:10) furthering that divide because it makes people not want to date actually I wanted to let me just finish the chat
(1:26:17) but just if you want just write a note and we'll we'll get it in oh wait i need to finish Lucas's hold on ogle i'll come
(1:26:23) back to that one in just a moment let me finish up Lucas's uh so sir Simple can you square this circle for me i'm a
(1:26:30) happily married redpilled Christian nationalist MAGA voter so based based uh
(1:26:36) so is my wife so is my wife by the way on each of the preceding fronts and yet
(1:26:42) according to you he's a I'm a radicalized miserable incel loner
(1:26:48) misogynist do you want to respond to that i would love to the studies show that most people who consume red pill
(1:26:55) content are becoming isolated angry mad at women and they're dating less you are an exception could you say the same
(1:27:01) about like feminism though which of the studies show that by the way all the ones I gave you
(1:27:07) the case of misuse of evolutionary psychology and online manosphere communities yep the case for female uh
(1:27:13) all of them all three things I just cited different studies yeah can you tell me though you didn't you didn't put
(1:27:21) in who the people were for the studies because often times you can click I'll send you the electronic file if you want
(1:27:27) have you heard Have you heard of what's called publishing bias sure let's not trust stats no no no it's
() 
(1:27:33) not it's not about that listen like hear me out here okay um there's something
(1:27:38) called a the replication crisis you ever heard of that the replication crisis no when you go back to redo sociology
(1:27:44) studies the vast majority of them can't be replicated okay the vast majority and that would be psychology and sociology
(1:27:52) would you say that these studies that you gave me are mostly sociological yes okay and would therefore suffer from
(1:28:00) the replication crisis and that would mean that there's a good possibility that up to 60% of what you just gave me
(1:28:07) here will never be replicated i think when you have so many studies saying similar things I don't think that's an
(1:28:12) issue i also think that you can grant that most of the red pill community are potential like incelss is a there's a
(1:28:18) ven diagram of people in the red pill but that's where publishing bias comes in hold on mhm in the red pill community
(1:28:23) incelss are a big part of the red pill community what is What is an incel someone who's involuntarily celibate
(1:28:29) meaning they can't have sex even though they'd like to okay so they can't get a hooker
(1:28:34) i I guess but maybe they don't want to maybe they want a real They're not involuntarily celebrated do you not believe in incels so they're not
(1:28:40) involuntarily well I just I'm asking you a question why are you ask You're asking me a stupid question do you not believe
(1:28:45) in incels can Can an incel buy a hooker sure okay then you say they don't want to potentially so how are they
(1:28:51) involuntarily celibate you think they should buy a hooker no I'm asking how they're involuntarily celibate because
(1:28:58) they can't get someone to date them Andrew but that wouldn't be I'm sorry what does celibacy mean this is the same
() 
(1:29:04) [ __ ] you do what are we talking about if you don't acknowledge that incelss are real just say that but don't
(1:29:10) try to play this game don't play debate club with me don't play debate club with me debate clubbing nothing i'm making debate club no it's not see semantics
(1:29:18) are a big debate club thing semantics are part of debate do you believe that incelss are real do it's hard to say
(1:29:26) depends on what you can't just say yes it depends on what you can't just say yes because this is what you do i will say yes or no if you just clarify for me
(1:29:33) that an involuntary celibate is a person who just can never get sex no matter
(1:29:38) what that's typically the definition yes okay can these people get prostitutes can they buy prostitutes who knows you
(1:29:46) don't you don't know if they can i maybe they don't have money i have no idea oh okay do incels exist by that definition
(1:29:53) not my definition do incelss exist well it depends well depends do incels exist
(1:29:58) from my definition this is some [ __ ] game my definition or yours anyone's definition just Bro I don't know why you
(1:30:05) don't understand what semantics are i don't understand why you can't answer the question i don't need to be walked through it i don't want to play your
(1:30:11) game dude i'm not playing a game yes you are do incels exist oh not by your definition i have no idea if incelss
(1:30:16) exist how could I even admit to Oh my god okay let me ask you a question do lifippados exist not that I know of wait
(1:30:22) wait what's a leaf flipadoo who knows then how the [ __ ] do you know if they exist or not have you read a study on
(1:30:28) inflipados well why would that matter okay I did do leaf flipados exist or not
(1:30:34) okay Andrew and what I mean by leaf flipadoo what I mean by leaf flipadoo is you have a
(1:30:40) proprietary definition okay you can't so this this is what's called equivocation it's facious argumentation it's called
(1:30:46) debate club that's what you're doing it's called debate club are you in a debate i didn't think so i think we're
(1:30:51) having a discussion no why because we're having a discussion about red pill you sat down before the show didn't she an
(1:30:56) excellent we're having a discussion about red pill but now you're saying that red pill communities don't have incels which is complete [ __ ] well
(1:31:03) they don't exist in your world not what I said either you're trying to get some stupid definition that doesn't exist listen I'm trying to explain this to you
(1:31:08) no you're not trying to do [ __ ] avoid the question when you're done I'll explain you're not trying no I don't need to be explaining well I'm going to explain it anyway so just so that you
(1:31:15) understand definitionally things can be here's debate club 101 everybody if you want to be in the debate club listen
(1:31:21) everybody because this is super important right super important incelss don't exist in a debate incels don't exist by the way we're in a debate all
(1:31:27) you incelss out there it's not true all you incelss I'm sorry doesn't believe you exist he doesn't think you exist
(1:31:32) well when when you're done I'll explain I'm not I'm done but I'm not going to so I'll explain so if if you're an
(1:31:38) incel in No if you're an incel doesn't think you exist he thinks you should just go buy a hooker just FYI which
(1:31:45) would definitely Which Wait Andrew just go ahead which if he could buy a hooker by his definition would make you an incel so how this works is if somebody
(1:31:52) has a definition of something is proprietary right i don't know what he means by the thing he's asking so I
(1:31:58) asked him does that just mean you can't get sex under any circumstances yes okay can they buy a hooker yes well then they
(1:32:05) can't they can get sex under some circumstances so don't stop stop bro so by your logic they wouldn't be incelss
(1:32:12) now if you have a different definition than that and you want to give it to me I'm willing to engage with it in good
(1:32:17) faith you're not arguing in good faith this is a complete and utter bad you're not You're not making an argument at all
(1:32:22) i'm saying incels exist and you're saying "Well what do you mean by incel?" Yes it's important no it's not important it's proprietary definition proprietary
(1:32:29) no it's not important you're making it important it's not okay the fact that you deny that incels exist is so silly
(1:32:35) that's not what I did hold on okay so let me read a couple chats and if you guys want to continue talking about that
(1:32:40) specific thing we will ogle thank you for the gifted 50 memberships thank you so much man really appreciate it guys
(1:32:46) w's in the chat for Ogle he just gifted 50 to the uh whatever community thank you man appreciate it very much we have

() 
(1:33:24) feel lonely and depressed but Andrew wants to play definition yeah I know terrible i want you clarify what you
(1:33:30) mean by things no you want to play a definition game 17 years seven lawsuits filed against me

(1:34:08) appreciate that you fight for your children that's all I'm asking for is that men who want to be with their children they fight for it i'm sorry
(1:34:14) it's so hard that it shouldn't be that hard but that's all I'm saying should happen should you have a child it shouldn't be so hard
(1:34:21) it shouldn't be i don't think so okay i You know what great this is a great red pill talking point wait let me let me
(1:34:29) Okay go ahead go ahead go ahead they also they also don't believe that it should be so hard and so they're
(1:34:35) fighting tooth and nail especially um you know men's rights advocacy MAS men's
(1:34:40) rights advocacy group so that it's not so hard that's one subsect of the red pill community but again as we
(1:34:46) established the red pill content creators that we're talking about promote uh promise well you only
(1:34:51) mentioned two uh I mentioned three who andrew Tate Fresh and Fit this podcast
(1:34:57) This podcast does not promote promis i'm trying to avoid it cuz I like Brian no no no this podcast does not promote promiscuity okay i would like I need It
(1:35:04) doesn't promote marriage yes it Well I You do but I'm not saying you do well wait a second i'm sorry i thought it was
(1:35:10) was about dating your whole TW wasn't enough about dating does it need to promote marriage it doesn't promote
(1:35:16) marriage does it need to i You don't think people should get married that's fine i should Well should the dating
(1:35:21) podcast promote marriage i think so the date the dating podcast should promote marriage i think so yeah i think
(1:35:28) that isn't that the point but you can't ask questions you can't ask questions about abortion isn't that the point of dating why do you date if you're not
(1:35:33) going to try to get married why do you date if you're not going to try to get married there's a lot of people who want to get who date without getting married yeah tons okay but should you i don't
(1:35:40) think so okay well then shut up but don't you no i think I think people should get married if they want to get
(1:35:46) married that's what I think yeah so then they should be able to date without getting married sure if they'd like to so then what are you even bitching about
(1:35:52) i'm not bitching i'm saying that this podcast Fresh and Fit [ __ ] [ __ ] andrew Tate Fresh and Fit and I'm sorry Brian
(1:36:00) brian doesn't believe in marriage and these people and you're you're promoting neither do you you don't believe it either yeah I don't i just got married
(1:36:06) you literally just said "I think people should get married if they want to." Okay oh great so is that a promotion of
(1:36:13) marriage they should get married if they want to is that promoting marriage is it sure Andrew and answer my question
(1:36:20) is are you promoting marriage by saying "Hey everybody you should get married if you want to." It's not not promoting
(1:36:26) marriage well this I tell you what it's a lot less than what I promote i'm not saying
(1:36:31) you me a staple of this show here we'll get We got a couple more chats here guys almost done we got Jason Cassell oh boy
(1:36:39) okay here he goes jason Castle donated $100 i would keep an eye on your wife
(1:36:46) even feminist women really want real men unfortunately for you you are a feminist
(1:36:51) so you will probably be okay with it because you don't want to tell her what to do i'd love Jason to uh define what a
(1:36:58) real man is so if he can send in another $100 a real man is a guy who sends in another $100 or champagne pop that
(1:37:05) that's that's an option you know maybe a little liquor for Jason a real man sends in a champagne pop little liquor maybe
(1:37:12) uh I don't know if it'll get things a little more aggressive and then I'll make sure that he doesn't get any you're
(1:37:18) You'll drink You'll pound the whole bottle he'll pound the whole All right we got Red Fox here thank you man thank
(1:37:23) you Jason good to see you man red Fox donated $100 thank you man if your goal
(1:37:28) is to convince people away from Red Pill why don't you just talk to Andrew and thoroughly think through your position
(1:37:35) instead you divided the audience you seem like an useful idiot i would love
(1:37:40) to talk about just the red pill but Andrew puts conversations into all kinds of different things we'll talk about
(1:37:46) abortion we're talking about single mothers we're talking about all this stuff even though I'm trying to pull people out of this so I'm I'm trying to
(1:37:52) give a justification for red pill ideology and one such justification would be that women have reproductive
(1:37:58) control which could create incentives for men to not want to be with women in modernity now you literally told me that
(1:38:05) is in no way shape or form cuz I asked you five time wrote it down five times and you said that if that is in no way a
(1:38:12) contributing factor do you think right now anybody should ever take anything you [ __ ] say seriously after you said
(1:38:17) that yes absolutely okay because I'm trying to help people get out of this thing you're just trying to keep people
(1:38:22) divided christopher Scott donated $100 thank you Christopher appreciate you're not here in good faith you won't answer
(1:38:29) questions you whine about everything and act like a child man up you want to
(1:38:35) respond to that or No okay uh Christopher thank for the soup chat we have Lucas here and then we'll get back
(1:38:40) to the uh debate portion lucas uh pink hatwear I have an honest question for you you say you have a podcast of female
(1:38:46) guests geared towards helping men do you truly believe right of center men align
(1:38:51) with your positions or is your target audience white dudes for Camala genuine
(1:38:56) question from Lucas there i appreciate the genuine question um I only started a month ago but I've gotten over a million
(1:39:03) views and I've gotten a lot of messages from people who are in red pill and they say "You're giving me hope that all the
(1:39:08) stuff that they say out there about a man has to be six foot tall a man has to make six figures a man has to have
(1:39:14) six-pack abs those are the only guys that women want." And the women I interview are definitely especially the
(1:39:19) the married ones are saying that isn't the case so a lot of people a lot of
(1:39:24) people have said "Thank you so much i appreciate it." fathers have reached out to me and said "Hey I appreciate what
(1:39:31) you're doing my sons are going to watch your videos because I really hope they don't go down the red pill rabbit hole."
(1:39:36) So it has nothing to do with left i'm not a political person i mean I am personally but my podcast has nothing to
(1:39:42) do with politics it really is let's help these guys see that women aren't the you know paras that podcast in the red pill
(1:39:50) space make them out to be you're talking about Blackpill descriptors i'm talking about people who listen to Red Pill content yeah I know that's not what even
(1:39:56) even the guys that you stated Tate all those guys they don't say that that's all women want what they say is that if
(1:40:02) you want to heighten your chances for dating the type of woman that you want right you would work on male
(1:40:07) self-improvement and here's things that you could do to do that that is not what they say they say you should if if women
(1:40:13) only want high status men that's what they say no they don't say only either yes they do okay so listen do you
(1:40:18) understand that like if you work at a [ __ ] Starbucks as a woman and you're dating a janitor he's high status to you
(1:40:24) right what yeah did you hear what I said if someone's working at Starbucks and
(1:40:29) they're dating a janitor that man's high status yeah if he's making $29 an hour as a [ __ ] janitor and you're a
(1:40:34) barista he would be high status right i I don't know that they'd see it like that but Okay okay well how do they see
(1:40:40) it you tell me they see it as like I like this guy i don't want to date him i think that's what they see okay no no how do these Red Pillars see it they see
(1:40:46) it as no one who works as a janitor will get a woman no they don't see it that way yes they do no you're totally You're
(1:40:53) totally wrong on this no I'm not so have I who which ones the people who write me are you talking about the content
(1:40:58) creator i'm talking about the people who follow this [ __ ] yeah I'm talking about the content creators you're talking about i'm talking about the actual people who listen to it and they write
() 
(1:41:04) me and they say there's no way a woman would date somebody who works at McDonald's and that's not true and they
(1:41:09) listen I don't know what these individuals are telling you talk to the individual i'm telling going to tell you what the content creators are saying
(1:41:15) okay and by the way I also watch what they say okay well here's here's what they say here's what Myron Gaines would
(1:41:20) agree to and I guarantee you Andrew Tate would agree to it i guarantee you that that both of those guys would and I know Brian would as well okay they're trying
(1:41:28) to say that of course men should work on male improvement that doesn't mean that
(1:41:34) you're all women on planet Earth are only going to want you if you're in the top 1% or the top 15% that's [ __ ]
(1:41:41) absurd you can watch If that's absurd then tell me why every red pillar I come
(1:41:46) across believes that they don't they do they don't every red pillar I come across believes that you know what show me a message i'll show you go through my
(1:41:52) Tik Tok just go to my Tik Tok right now scroll through my comments no no no just show me a single DM i didn't say DM i
(1:41:58) said comments oh in the comments yeah so what so what that doesn't count people Red Pillars can't comment red pillars
(1:42:04) can't Oh yeah no you're not sure you're not sure they can write the words the words aren't there trying to answer no you're not you're not i'm not I'm not
(1:42:09) sure that it's legitimate no because that it legitimately comes from Myin Gaines who would not tell you that a
(1:42:17) janitor can't date a woman at Starbucks that's [ __ ] crazy would never say it in a million years i know the guy he
(1:42:23) would never say that [ __ ] i'm telling you that when I ask women "Would you date someone under 6' tall?" Every guy
(1:42:28) in there says "That's just not true that's just not true that's just not true." Because they believe the [ __ ] that they're seeing from this stuff
(1:42:33) that's [ __ ] it's not [ __ ] it's true and this is the point I'm trying to make every guy
(1:42:38) who listens to Red Pill let me tell you something the fact that you don't care about these [ __ ] guys is the problem you don't care about these guys andrew
(1:42:44) let me tell you something do you think there's a problem with man male on the lives in this country yes okay do you
(1:42:50) what are you doing about it well I mean the first thing I did was advocate an anti-war position because PTSD is what
(1:42:56) led to a lot of the unliving stats that's some of the stats but there's other people that aren't in the military that question what was your question
(1:43:02) what do you do to help these people and do you think that advocating for an anti-war stance that doesn't help people
(1:43:08) when someone has what happened let's say there is no more war and people still have PTSD what do they do well they get
() 
(1:43:14) treatment okay so you believe in treatment for PTSD there's lots of men's groups which are good for treatment do
(1:43:19) you believe in treatment for severe depression in some cases what cases wouldn't you advocate for it it depend
(1:43:26) it would depend on the criteria for severe what how how what what do you mean I
(1:43:31) can't get out of [ __ ] bed in the morning and all they think about it is unaliv yeah like the incels 95% of them
(1:43:37) report that you may have to have medical no they don't 95% don't report that they can't get out of bed in the morning 95%
(1:43:43) report depression yeah of course you do cuz you don't give a [ __ ] about people you don't care about people on literally
(1:43:49) not true do you believe in therapy in some cases therapy can be helpful and in
(1:43:55) other cases it [ __ ] people up okay what cases is therapy messing with people well so psych Okay let's get into it
(1:44:01) psychology is the study of the mind can you tell me what is the disease process for you to diagnose a person with a
(1:44:07) psychological disorder i don't know but I do know that because it [ __ ] exists so what that doesn't mean therapy
(1:44:12) doesn't work okay how does it work have you looked into the studies about CBT uh CBT like the marijuana stuff no that's
(1:44:19) CBD what is CBT you don't know about cognitive behavioral therapy no what is it well then what is it it's one of the
(1:44:26) most successful versions of therapy that have helped a lot of people get out of depression okay what does it do it's a
(1:44:31) talk therapy that basically shows cognitive study of the mind it's not a study of the mind yes well it has to be
(1:44:37) because No it's talk therapy where talk therapy doing what to help you get
(1:44:42) elevate your mood and get you out of bed and could you go with like I don't know
(1:44:47) an instrument and do a little test on a guy and be like "Oh your depression
(1:44:52) level was here and now it's here." Do you know how people answer my question and then ask me a question do you know
(1:44:58) how people typically and then ask No because that's not how it's tested yeah right exactly because it's not how it's
(1:45:04) [ __ ] because that's not how it's tested you said answer the question and then I could say so here I am saying that's not how it's tested yeah because
(1:45:10) it's not a disease depression is not a disease no this is why I know that out there if you're depressed Andrew doesn't
(1:45:15) give a [ __ ] about you it's not a disease andrew doesn't give a [ __ ] about you if you're depressed it's not a disease it's just something in your head i will bet
(1:45:21) you $100 right now you can get your cell phone look up if depression is actually a classified disease for the record if
(1:45:28) you have if you have depression if you have depression Andrew doesn't care it's not a disease cognitive behavioral
(1:45:34) therapy doesn't work is it a disease bet 100 bucks yes okay then then go grab
(1:45:39) your phone no I'm not grabbing you're not going to bet no cuz it's not a [ __ ] disease so people aren't there
(1:45:45) if you're going to like talk to the audience this camera if Andrew if you have severe depression Andrew doesn't
(1:45:50) care if you get help he doesn't He doesn't think you should get help because it's [ __ ] because depression isn't real by the way depression is not
(1:45:57) a real thing it's not a disease it's not a disease so that means you shouldn't get it treated because it's not
(1:46:02) considered a disease so okay so I don't understand how do we get from depression's not a disease and that
(1:46:10) means that depression doesn't exist you don't believe in the treatments for it no no no what I was trying to demonstrate to you is that psychology is
(1:46:17) a study of the mind and because of this you can actually do interventional treatments on people which do more
(1:46:22) damage than good because tell me a study that it does more damage than good do you know what so you want psychologists
(1:46:30) to start studying in their own field where 60 70% plus of the studies can't
(1:46:35) be replicated and govern their own field by telling you that the studies that they're making are bad therapy isn't
(1:46:41) real to Andrew because you can't replicate it therapy is [ __ ] yeah psychology is therapy is [ __ ] i asked him if he thinks therapy is
(1:46:47) realology is [ __ ] i I said I asked him if therapy is real he said some instances now it's [ __ ] the real truth comes out there can be there can
(1:46:53) be therapeutics that work yes but therapy by and large in and of itself as an occupational is [ __ ] and
(1:46:58) psychology is [ __ ] yeah there are several studies that show the improvement there's several studies that are done by the same people who are
(1:47:04) studying the mind if you're depressed Andrew doesn't care about you i just want to point that out i don't understand do what when did I say
(1:47:10) depression is not real you don't care about the treatment yeah when did I say that i didn't care about treatment you don't because you don't believe it
(1:47:16) exists do you know that you can treat uh depression with things like uh hormone replacement therapy that's one avenue
(1:47:21) yes yeah i don't understand um if I would recommend that you would you would do things like hormone replacement
(1:47:27) therapy under the guide of an actual medical doctor right who didn't get a [ __ ] arts degree in psychology by the
(1:47:33) way but an actual MD right who gives you something like hormone replacement that stuff is truly effective for treating
(1:47:41) this type of stuff there can be hang on there can be limited instance of men's groups which seem to help with PTSD and
(1:47:47) things like this but by and large psychology is a [ __ ] croc of [ __ ] go
(1:47:52) ahead and demonstrate for me why it's effective okay so if you have severe depression maybe get some hormone
(1:47:58) therapy that's what Andrew is recommending instead of going to seek out a therapist read a book
(1:48:03) what's the cure rate for the severely depressed cbt has significantly improved people with severe depression cbt has
(1:48:11) how many i don't have the study in front of me but it's significant how much it's significant just like you said earlier
(1:48:18) you said earlier significant that was that was an acceptable answer before too of course you do cuz you don't think you
(1:48:23) don't you don't care about people with severe depression you don't care about people with severe depression you don't give a [ __ ] you don't care about them so
(1:48:29) many people in the red pill community have severe depression and you don't care so many people in the red pill
(1:48:34) community have severe depression and you don't give a [ __ ] so I you have to understand how illogical this is how
(1:48:40) much it doesn't make sense yeah because it's all [ __ ] me saying that you should be guarded in the treatment of psychology means that I don't care about
(1:48:45) people i have depression can you explain that logic to me you don't care about the treatment you don't
(1:48:51) believe that the treatment is real and you think the only thing they should do is go to hormone treatment therapy and also you think that PTSD also you think
(1:48:58) that people with PTSD it kind of works there but if you have severe depression as an incel it won't work there yeah it
() 
(1:49:04) didn't say that either that's what you're saying you know you're just straw manning me sure I'll straw man till you correct me okay so anyway so are there
(1:49:11) alternative therapies which can you can recommend you don't even know what CBT is so what therapies do you know about
(1:49:16) cbt is the most popular by the way okay yes so what so you don't know what the [ __ ] you're talking about okay so help
(1:49:22) me out here what is psychology it's a study it's a study yeah it's a
(1:49:28) study okay help me out here why is therapy [ __ ]
(1:49:34) i didn't say therapy is [ __ ] okay what I was talking about was psychology
(1:49:39) being [ __ ] there can be therapeutics I said which work a thousand times I've
(1:49:44) said this there can be therapeutics which work which ones but if you're talking about
(1:49:51) therapists which ones well for especially for people so the ones that I'm familiar with are people have PTSD
(1:49:57) and there seem to be therapeutics which work inside of these like uh groups who've gone through very similar
(1:50:03) experience and them being able to discuss and uh form communities around these types of things but I but I'm not
(1:50:10) sure that it's because of the discussions as much as it is about the community they're forming
(1:50:17) so what is your solution for the vast number of people who consume this content that are reporting severe
(1:50:23) depression um well I I don't I first of all you
(1:50:28) haven't demonstrated that's the case you just say here's some studies but No that's not enough well you I'd have to
(1:50:35) read the studies are men unaliviving themselves at an alarming rate
(1:50:41) um what is that cheers oh thanks yeah that's you
(1:50:46) and that's a concern for you or no yeah it's a big concern but you don't believe therapy uh well no i didn't say again
(1:50:55) for the hundth time some therapeutics can work for some men who are in severe depression but you know what causes a
(1:51:00) lot of this what I asked you this question earlier and I've just in a good faith way answered a ton of yours can
(1:51:07) you answer this one for me now what's that men who get divorced what happens
(1:51:12) to their unaliving rate yeah a lot of men who get divorced and I you know it I get it and I feel for those men and I
(1:51:19) hope that they get the help they need but you don't care if they get help they need but why would they need to get help if they didn't get married didn't get
(1:51:25) divorced well people get divorced that happens yeah I but not if they don't get married then they don't get divorced
(1:51:32) okay great now it don't when they get divorced the primary reasons that they report this depression is that they lost
(1:51:39) custody of their kids right sure yeah but I thought that women having control
(1:51:45) over men's kids didn't have anything to do with why men didn't want to get into the dating market that's not the reason
() 
(1:51:52) people aren't dating no no you don't think that a big contributor that's not the reason people aren't dating so the
(1:51:57) reason you think that people aren't dating and marrying is because they men are terrified that women will divorce
(1:52:03) them and take their kids no I don't think that's the reason they're not dating you don't think so no and you don't think that's why they're not
(1:52:08) getting married no oh okay because college educated people are still getting married yeah yeah so okay is it
(1:52:14) that most men it's a good percentage but it's not okay it's a good percentage of women yes but they're getting married to
(1:52:20) somebody i Yeah but women are marrying somebody aren't they i men but women are marrying somebody aren't they just cuz you're a woman in college doesn't mean
(1:52:25) you marry a college educated man okay but that's still people who are college educated are still getting married more
(1:52:31) including women nobody said include so if women are marrying somebody you disputed this if women are marrying somebody they're marrying men your
(1:52:37) concern I thought you were a big marriage advocate right yeah mhm don't you want marriage advocated for i want
(1:52:42) people who really want to get married and find love to do it yes so when So you think that these men who
(1:52:49) ordinarily would be playing into the dating market trying to find a wife are not concerned whatsoever that she's
(1:52:55) going to divorce him and take his kids i don't think that is the main reason people are aren't dating no okay then
(1:53:01) what's the main reason i didn't say dating i said marriage you have to get date to get married Andrew yeah no I'm
(1:53:07) asking about marriage specifically you have to date to get married isn't that a big deterrent you have to date do you have to date to get married what does
(1:53:13) that have to do with my question the question is you said "Why aren't people getting married?" It's like well I'm talking about they're not dating it's
(1:53:18) juice it's It's strawberry lemonade [ __ ] garbage strawberry lemonade so
(1:53:23) anyway back to this i'm asking about marriage not about dating now okay marriage why do you think men do you
(1:53:30) think that a lot of men don't want to get married because they're afraid that there could be a divorce and their
(1:53:37) children taking from them in the future if they get married no because I think if they're dating I think if these
(1:53:42) people are dating they're likely to eventually get married should the relationship progress i don't think they're just staying cohabitating the
(1:53:48) way you you're suggesting what do you want dude i don't know what you want put the the waters in frame okay here you go
(1:53:54) is that part of the thing it's just you know all right yeah go ahead it's his OCD it's my OCD sorry go ahead so anyway
(1:54:00) back to this what I'm saying is that I think that if people are dating the eventuality should
(1:54:07) the relationship go well will be marriage people aren't dating that's the whole point so So okay so I don't think
(1:54:15) if you're dating you're not going to say you know what I can't marry you because I'm afraid you're going to take my kids that's why I don't think that's
() 
(1:54:20) happening so you think that they would rather stay cohabitating no no i I think
(1:54:26) if you're dating somebody long term you're probably going to end up getting married but you're going to cohabitate first usually right sure yeah and what
(1:54:32) is the number one indicator of unaliving in men cohabitation
(1:54:38) that's the reason people are are it's it's you unal alive way more than if you're married right if you're
(1:54:44) cohabitating unal alive significantly more than when you're not so what's your point my point is is that your
(1:54:49) prescription which is more dating more dating more dating and then I ask you does that lead to more cohabitation you
(1:54:55) say yes it would actually be your prescription that led to more men unliving so men dating is the reason
(1:55:00) people are unating no it's men cohabitating which is dating too that no you just said that that would be the big
(1:55:06) side effect which you're fine with okay so in order for men So my prescription would lead to less unaliving of your
(1:55:12) prescription more what is your prescription so I think if men are dating that they should not cohabitate and that's what red pillars think too
(1:55:18) cuz they actually care about men unaliv red pills are going their own do you know about men going their own way
(1:55:24) mgttow is different they're also red pill by the way MGTTOW 100% doesn't want cohabitation i'm not saying they do
(1:55:30) they're going their own way that's another part of the red pill community so they're pushing do not date well if
(1:55:36) it's the case that you think dating leads to cohabitation before marriage and their prescription doesn't lead to
(1:55:42) that then they're saving a lot more [ __ ] lives than you good one Andrew right yeah yeah me advocating for people
(1:55:48) to date is is going to make people unalign themselves no oh if you think that dating leads to cohabitation and
(1:55:54) you're fine with cohabitation i also don't grant that that's the reason most people aren't enving themselves so I'd
(1:56:00) like to see a study on that yeah well actually I can send those to you please do yeah what's your number i'm not going
(1:56:06) to say it on air look in the camera no go ahead here let's uh do a little
(1:56:12) prompt change here um and we'll maybe try to move through these a bit quicker uh so Raphael you said that the
(1:56:19) manosphere exploits male pain and by extension I suppose you would say Andrew exploits male pain but offers no real
(1:56:26) healing um can you just specify uh how I guess yeah so um a lot of
(1:56:33) Andrew's rhetoric and and content that he pushes is basically again demonizing
(1:56:38) women demonizing feminism which makes a lot of the men less willing to date
() 
(1:56:43) women and that's why a lot of people in the red pill community are not dating women because they act actively see them
(1:56:49) as adversaries they actively see them as the enemy and I think a lot of red pill community uh pushes that that message
(1:56:55) just just one clarifying question even if that is what he was doing can you just um just for the prompt can you just
(1:57:01) explain how he's exploiting male pain yeah so I think the more riled up and
(1:57:06) anger angry that the audiences are the more money people make that's what I that's how I think that's the
(1:57:12) exploitation i make the most amount of money during chill streams okay but it's normally angry men and
(1:57:19) that follow these podcasts well I thought you just said the angrier they are the more money I make right okay
(1:57:24) what because keeping them angry they're going to stay around longer okay so um
(1:57:29) let's uh do you think do you think that uh like Joe Rogan for instance that he
(1:57:35) makes all of his money off of angry men not necessarily but I'm not here to I'm not talking about Joe well I'm just I
(1:57:42) thought you just said that you make more money if the audience is angry the red pill community oh it's specific to the
(1:57:47) red pill okay so just to make sure that I got this right um I'm doing this i
(1:57:54) think you are i think fresh and let's start with me because I'm here okay so what am I doing that's riing up men and
(1:58:00) making them upset you continue to demonize women and that gets your audience do I demonize women or do I
(1:58:05) demonize feminists both okay how do I demonize women you say some pretty nasty things about them and I've watched a lot
(1:58:12) of your podcast and if you're going to deny it that's fine but yeah about Okay so I'm not going to deny that I crack
(1:58:17) jokes sometimes at the expense of women joke at the expense of women that's true
(1:58:23) right but no I I I really don't demonize women as a group do you call women a lot
(1:58:29) of names on your podcast uh I call usually a woman no do you call groups of
(1:58:35) women names some like feminists yes no that's not a name that's not a derogatory name at least it is to me
() 
(1:58:41) well of course it is cuz you hate feminism and you continue to demonize it and you continue to demonize women and
(1:58:46) you continue to demonize women on your podcast just like Fresh and Fit just like Andrew do you think if men agree
(1:58:51) with me about the ideas that I have right that they want to date feminists i
(1:58:59) don't think they want to date women yeah they definitely want to date women they're not and they're married a lot of them are married maybe on your
(1:59:05) individual channel but not on this podcast how am I riing up [ __ ] a bunch of men to knock because you also come here you also come here and this is a
(1:59:11) bigger audience than your channel yeah and they guess where they move to my channel yeah the angry men
(1:59:18) continue to move over to your channel oh okay where all the married men are not all the married men yeah that's where Listen show me the breakdown of people
(1:59:25) show me the breakdown of people in your podcast that are married i bet you right now you're about to see a massive sound off of fever see it all married people
(1:59:33) switch over to the live chat watch this yeah put it up we could do a poll um
(1:59:39) let's see if there's a Now this is be This would be the whatever sample though but we could do it on the Crucible and I guarant [ __ ] tear you i also don't
(1:59:45) necessarily think that your your poll is going to be accurate but go for it well I agree i like literally I do agree with
(1:59:51) that but the thing is is like YouTube has much better breakdowns so yeah if you would ask me I would have
(1:59:57) actually sent that before the debate but that's what I'm saying i think Fresh and Fit has that breakdown i think this podcast has that breakdown i think
(2:00:02) Andrew Tate has that breakdown and I can tell you they're probably not married people yeah I demonize mostly feminists you demonize women too you call women
(2:00:09) all kinds of names i've heard it myself especially on solo podcast why is it though that I have so many female
(2:00:14) followers you have so many i actually do yeah what's the percentage about 10% for my channel whoa do you do you know that
(2:00:20) YouTube is is male dominant red Pill is male dominated no no no no youtube So Tik Tok is female dominant
(2:00:28) okay it's like um I think 70% women okay right youtube male dominant okay having
(2:00:34) a channel right like most women's audience is men on YouTube okay the the
(2:00:41) fact that I have so many female followers is actually not common for a
(2:00:47) male podcaster it's actually not common well good for you but I'm saying that most of the red pill community is not
(2:00:52) that way okay but you were Who are we talking about i'm talking about the red pill community yeah what am I doing though to exacerbate this problem of men
(2:00:58) hating women i I've already explained that yeah not really just say sometimes I I crack jokes about them i didn't say
(2:01:04) anything about jokes you said jokes i said you demonize women okay well here's the thing too i crack jokes about Mexicans am I
(2:01:12) demonizing your audience could be pretty racist too i encountered them firsthand in our first debate am I demonizing them
(2:01:18) mexicans um well if you're if you're riing up hate for Mexicans in your chat
(2:01:23) then yes cuz I got a lot of Mexicans in my chat okay good but if I'm making Mexican jokes I'm saying jokes you keep
(2:01:30) saying jokes no one else is saying jokes they're literally jokes they're literally jokes show me tell me anything
(2:01:36) I've said about women think of a name think of a name you've possibly have called women think of any
(2:01:42) name you've possibly have called a large group of women just think about it a large group or all women is there a
(2:01:49) comma after large like are you are you saying I'm saying like women no what
(2:01:54) what's the word i'm saying women as a whole as as a generalization what i'm I'm asking if you've done it i I mean
(2:02:02) nothing comes to mind okay well I don't Well I've said what i just don't think this is in good faith well what why
(2:02:08) don't you say what you think yeah what What did I say i mean you call them [ __ ] you call them No oh yes you do no
(2:02:14) oh yes you do no no no in fact [ __ ] is not a word I say often i'll call
(2:02:19) individual women skanks okay i don't actually say [ __ ] oh skanks that's such a funny joke yeah and No no no that's
(2:02:25) not a joke to call an individual woman a skank you don't do it individually i do when I say skates i guess I do your show
(2:02:31) then give me one time did Okay what i said you call them [ __ ] i don't okay i
(2:02:36) So I say all women are [ __ ] you've said it before it's never happened i didn't say all women i'm saying [ __ ] you just
(2:02:42) say [ __ ] saying the words are [ __ ] so if there's two women and they both [ __ ] 100 dudes I can't say they're
(2:02:48) [ __ ] sure sure how is that demonizing women is it
(2:02:54) saying nice things about women no it's saying mean things about those two people it's not talking about two people
(2:02:59) Andrew you generalize you generalize about women so much and the fact that you won't even admit about Bro you're
(2:03:08) generalizing and so do Why are you calling men incels i have studies that back up that they're incels oh you have
(2:03:14) So So do I need a study to back up that a chick who's banged 100 dudes a [ __ ] no you're talking about one person but
(2:03:19) you're talking about generalizing all women that's something you do constantly that's something that Fresh and Fit does
(2:03:25) they generalize women i'm [ __ ] right here tell me what I've said about all women the point is I'm talking about the red pill community i'm talking about the
(2:03:32) red pill community i'm talking about and I did and I've already said what you've done but you're denying it for some
(2:03:38) reason when I've ever said all women do you want to go through all your damn podcasts man you think if I did it you'd
(2:03:43) have an example since it was pertinent i've seen you do it so yes when i don't know two weeks ago andrew what the [ __ ]
(2:03:50) i've watched a lot of your [ __ ] mhm i've seen so I I've so much I'll tell you what this is fair what type of
(2:03:56) content do I do mostly political mostly political
(2:04:02) okay and what is the number one type of show that I do um you do debates but you all I say the
(2:04:10) topic you debate the most if it's not Christianity it's feminism so you think the most popular content on my channel
(2:04:16) is debates i think so okay followed by political commentary sometimes you have political
(2:04:22) debates as well we had a political debate yeah I know but you just said political most of my channel is political commentary i think you consider yourself a political
(2:04:28) commentator that's what you say every time you introduce yourself well I No that's not what I say i say I'm a political commentator and what i don't
() 
(2:04:35) know what the and is i political satist sure politics as I said political satist okay so am I wrong about being polit am
(2:04:43) I wrong about you being more political focused is that Are you Are you making a different point or No no what I'm saying to you is I don't actually think that
(2:04:50) you've watched my show i have i've also been on then what is the thing my show
(2:04:56) is the most famous for the one show that we do that is the most famous thing we do isn't it debating nope not even in
(2:05:03) the same universe then what is it it's the Tik Tok invasions that's YouTube yeah that's what made us popular but
(2:05:10) that's maybe that made you popular at one point but that's not what you're doing consistently every week you're mostly doing debates every week listen I
(2:05:17) do I actually many weeks do less debates than I do invasions okay my point still
(2:05:22) stands and by the way political community do you deny that the red pill community is demonizes women yeah but I
(2:05:28) want No no ask question i will i will no no answer it now no no no more caveats no does the red pill community demonize
(2:05:36) women yeah yeah no but I want this no it doesn't no okay no I don't think so so I I want to finish this real quick um have
(2:05:43) you actually watched my show yes when when's the last time you watched it i don't know but this week I obviously saw
(2:05:49) what you said to Pearl obviously saw what you said to that guy on the iPad yeah well you couldn't have seen that on my channel you saw you de you so you saw
(2:05:56) it in her channel right so did you demonize red pill communities this week on your channel or not uh I I might No I
(2:06:03) don't think so when you call them degenerates I don't think I called red pillars degenerates you literally said
(2:06:08) red pill content creators are degenerates including Myron Gains you even said you had disagreements with
(2:06:14) Brian you even mentioned Brian by name in that same statement do you remember when I said that there's a difference
(2:06:19) between the red pill and what no I don't content creators you mentioned Myin and
(2:06:24) Brian by name yeah so I'm talking about content creators those are content creators that's not the red pill the red
(2:06:30) pill is a disen content creators are degenerates you're not talking about the packet
(2:06:35) being a degenerate you're talking about the creators right so the creators are degenerates so you mentioned Myron
(2:06:41) Gaines and you mentioned Brian by name i didn't yeah so here's the thing again if
(2:06:47) you're talking about Red Pill content creators there's a lot more of them than [ __ ] Brian but we're talking about the big ones i don't care about the
(2:06:52) other ones we're talking about the big ones the ones that have the most We're talking about the ones that have the most reach and that's these people they
(2:06:58) have the most reach okay what matters is who's informing their opinions the content creators no no who's informing
(2:07:04) the content creators opinions i don't care the content creator matters no they're disseminating the message that's what matters what matters they're
(2:07:10) disseminating the message you're not getting it doesn't they're disseminating a message i don't care if you learned
(2:07:15) about Nazism through something else if you're disseminating it you're still disseminating is that if there's hundreds hundreds and hundreds of Red
(2:07:22) Pill content creators which there are all you're doing is pointing to three creators you don't like the biggest ones
(2:07:27) no first of all the combination of all other Red Pill creators would be bigger than these three biggest ones okay sure
(2:07:33) but they're the biggest ones no they're not the combination of the message that you're talking about then why did you highlight those two it's not the biggest
(2:07:38) then why did you highlight my games you did on your own show we can pull it up right now i'm not talking about I'm not
(2:07:44) talking about Pearl i'm talking about when you were talking to that guy on the iPad you said your sound's low if you don't remember it's cuz your lack of
(2:07:50) sleep but you were talking to a guy i think it was on Tuesday on your own show you said red pill content creators are
(2:07:56) degenerates i don't I don't know what the context is you It's literally that there is no context of course you're
(2:08:02) trying to weasel out of this of course you're trying to weasel out of it [ __ ] what I know do you want to pull it up actually I do okay let's go to his
(2:08:08) channel what show is it whatever you were talking to that guy on the iPad whoever that homie was that you were talking to i don't know who he was i
(2:08:14) don't I've never seen him before but you were on the show i think it was Tuesday and you said this exact thing i would love this yes it was on the Crucible i
(2:08:22) would love to show this i would I would love to have this pulled up show it

(2:10:34) do you want to respond to Lucas he called you i'm I'm not scroll through it but do you remember this conversation yeah do you know how long ago that was a
(2:10:41) couple days ago two years ago okay so does this says two days ago for the record yeah it got the clip got posted
(2:10:47) two days ago but the conversation was from two years ago you're so your channel posted a clip from two days ago where you said red pill communities are
(2:10:53) degenerating i don't know i don't even know if that was said i'm just explaining to you that that's a really old conversation you can play the audio
(2:10:58) on i'm trying to find the date of the time it's a long clip obviously i think Well I think it's two years ago or maybe a year and a half ago i'm not sure yeah
(2:11:05) rick Rickus Morty but I'm pretty sure it's not from from the last year well while you're while you're looking for
(2:11:10) that we have Charlie B can I send you the link donated $100 it's more people
(2:11:16) today are medicated more people today are in therapy thank you Charlie how is it working explain the difference
(2:11:22) between anxiety/depression and the felling of the human condition okay so yeah we're
(2:11:29) definitely seeking more help than we ever have which is why it seems like we're overly medicated but it's because people are actually like trying to get
(2:11:35) the help for the first time anxiety is more a general worry about the future it's this very general thing and
(2:11:41) depression is more of a general overwhelming sadness that is is more
(2:11:46) than just the emotion it's like you literally can't function in society you just feel absolutely down all right yeah
(2:11:53) it's really interesting to me that the real Terry donated $100 thank you Real Ter a good chunk of Andrew's viewers are
(2:12:00) redpilled men and women and he does more for his audience than 99% of creators

(2:12:11) yeah he has no idea he's never watched the show right i just pulling up a clip that from the show you said right yeah
(2:12:16) you watched a clip that from from how long ago two days ago i'll just read
(2:12:22) from two days ago on this lucas do I mean I got posted two days ago you are creating a straw man character of what the red pill is as Andrew said the
(2:12:28) intellectual godfather of the so-called red pill Roamasi is in a 30-year marriage with a 20some year old married
(2:12:36) daughter for that matter I would consider my Oh he continued it on
(2:12:44) oh he he continued okay so the super chats that were marked two and three is

(2:13:26) this worthless crap brian S thanks for the YouTube super chat man really appreciate brian I'm sorry for that
(2:13:32) experience but I highly recommend a book called uh Feeling Good by Dr david Burns it's a really good book on CBT and it's

(2:15:03) audience he won't answer questions dude you know that guys are bent towards logic so why don't you make a effing
(2:15:09) argument the argument is a lot of red pillars are isolated they're angry they
(2:15:14) blame women and they're dating less i'm trying to help them stop doing that and Red Pill content is pushing them further
(2:15:19) down the rabbit erroneous erroneous it's not erroneous it's literally factual that's a That just so you know that's
(2:15:26) still not actually an argument that's just a statement well it's a true statement

(2:18:10) claims I would make in the debate healthy masculinity is expansive not rigid can What do you mean by that yeah
(2:18:16) i just don't subscribe to the idea that there's only one way to be considered quote unquote masculine so like
(2:18:22) traditional gender roles you would say uh traditional generals you can be masculine and traditional general but I think if you're not that doesn't
(2:18:28) necessarily mean you're less masculine for example if your wife makes more money than you I don't think that makes you less masculine okay Andrew the So
(2:18:34) the the positive claim he makes is healthy masculinity is expansive not rigid is that something you want to bite
(2:18:40) on or Yeah but you have to get into semantics i don't want to get into semantics that I can't get a position no
(2:18:46) because for for the sake of the conversation will you get into semantics i hear what
(2:18:52) you're saying but do me do me a solid but I get I get Are you Are you my homie i We're homiesomies we're homies but
(2:18:58) what I'm saying is Andrew has these does these tactics man it's not about No because but he's doing bad faith
(2:19:04) arguments bro strawberry i appreciate it but he's doing bad faith arguments he's doing bad faith i haven't even made this
(2:19:09) you will i know you so I'm gonna make You're mad because I'm about Stop me from preemptively making
(2:19:16) an argument okay let's let's get into it okay let's do some answers do you like the lemonade by the way i just want to
(2:19:21) know what you mean by masculinity what does that mean to you um I don't have a solid definition my general definition
(2:19:27) of masculinity and it's very loose is basically men doing the right thing because it's the right thing and it's
(2:19:33) not the best definition because I don't think masculinity can be so defined what that's That's my definition
(2:19:41) men doing the right thing because it's the right thing correct what's the right thing um protecting people being good to
(2:19:48) people that's what I think is masculine protecting people and being good to people mhm okay but what does good to
(2:19:54) people mean what does that mean i'm not getting into morality i'm not doing I'm not even getting That's where it goes
(2:19:59) that's where it goes Andrew that's where it goes no I'm just asking what this what this means i gave you my definition
(2:20:05) move on provide your definition provide whatever it is you want to do yeah so I can give you my definition of
(2:20:10) masculinity but you haven't given me yours i did go for it so it I I just want to make sure I got it right then
(2:20:16) and I'm going to write down every word masculinity is men doing the right thing
(2:20:23) because it's the right thing not for any sort of transaction or reward men doing the right thing because it's the right
(2:20:30) thing yes now I need you to understand this i know that you think that these are sneaky debate tricks right even
(2:20:37) though I've sat across this table this by the way is the first time ever that I've been in studio and had a a
(2:20:43) one-on-one debate where it's even been slightly heated and usually we start serious where it's been a 1 v one where
(2:20:50) it's even been Well no with the two degenerates that was the only other time literally that was the only other time in a 1 v one where it was even really
(2:20:56) Never gotten heated you never got heated dude it was pretty tame no I'm serious you've never gotten heated no what did I
(2:21:02) just say can you even repeat in a 101 debate it's never been heated no no no what did I [ __ ] see you don't even
(2:21:07) listening dude you don't even want to listen this is the only one he said in this studio
(2:21:12) this is the only one v one that I can think of where it's even gotten heated okay yeah that's the that's the case and
(2:21:20) usually it's because I clarify everything before we start talking about it so we're not talking past each other
(2:21:26) yeah cuz you love definitions it's your favorite thing in the whole world dude how do we know what we're talking about you know what we're talking about you just Yes you do okay masculinity is men
(2:21:34) doing the right thing okay well I think the right thing is for you to [ __ ] uh I don't know punch yourself in the
(2:21:39) [ __ ] dick now do it great so you're So you're feminine you're feminine okay
(2:21:45) punch yourself in the dick or you're feminine yeah okay yeah cuz you're feminine good point [ __ ] stupid dude
(2:21:50) you have to tell me what these things mean good point tell me what it means what does it mean what is the right thing my
(2:21:56) definition what is the right thing bro doing it tell me your definition what is the right thing tell me your definition you haven't told me tell me your
(2:22:02) definition uh I think Tell me your definition i think that masculinity is when men tell me your definition i just did
(2:22:09) okay well I think masculinity is when men beat up women and kick them while they're down that's the only way to be masculine you say that in Jess but a lot
(2:22:16) of truth is said in No it's 100% a lot of truth is said in chest you got a lot of truth a lot of [ __ ] you know you got
(2:22:22) to really get in there yeah joking like that is oh that's coming from a real place from you that's coming from a real place that's coming from a real solid
(2:22:29) place i mean I would give you No that's coming from the soul andrew I'd give you a different That's coming from the soul you ask me questions that's coming from
(2:22:34) the soul ask me questions oh man you really You meant that you meant that yeah and then you got But you got to
(2:22:40) kick them when they're down yeah of course yeah you can't let the [ __ ] up yeah it's just a joke right a lot of
(2:22:46) truth is said in the chest Andrew is it absolutely like when you were like
(2:22:51) before the show started and you were making Kate shows about yourself is that where you tried to tell me something i
(2:22:57) never once did that what oh come on dude what did he just really make that up just to say some [ __ ] dude did I did
(2:23:04) I miss something everybody missed it cuz it never [ __ ] happened what I'm pointing out to you right
(2:23:09) is when you're bad faith like this I'm going to be bad faith back okay go for
() 
(2:23:15) it then you've been bad faith this whole time there's no bro asking you bad faith asking you about your proprietary
(2:23:21) [ __ ] definition i gave you my definition i'm not going to go into morality because then it becomes I'm not even going into morality i'm just asking
(2:23:27) what you ask somebody what good is when you ask somebody what is good is that not morality they define the [ __ ]
(2:23:32) thing by what is good then I have to ask you what good is you [ __ ] dot but that's what I'm saying i'm not [ __ ]
(2:23:38) I'm not going to get into morality with you because it's the same [ __ ] every time with you this is your favorite argument is morality then what you
(2:23:43) should just look at the camera and monologue dude i will i'm not debating i'm just screaming i got to prompt change then um Well he doesn't want to
(2:23:49) define masculinity he only wants to you know pick apart our mind you haven't even defined it sure you just gave a
(2:23:55) proprietary definition it's your positive claim so what yeah but I have to define it for him i defined it i have
(2:24:00) to define it for him i defined it you didn't dude did he define it no he No it makes satisfied with it listen it's
(2:24:07) circular masculinity is men doing the right thing that [ __ ] doesn't tell us
(2:24:12) anything because I don't have a very prescriptive version of masculinity that is my general so then it would be to ask
(2:24:20) follow-up questions about what the right thing is you don't want to get morality but you don't want to tell me any [ __ ] answers to any questions here
(2:24:25) well if if you don't want to get into the morality can you say you said it's uh healthy masculinity is expansive
(2:24:32) andrew's got to take a little smoke break here little smoke break because Andrew thinks masculinity is very rigid if you don't fall within these
(2:24:38) guidelines pretty [ __ ] if you don't if you don't fall be nice come on if you don't fall within these certain guidelines it's you're not masculine

(2:27:34) if if you are talking about something and making a prescriptive ought in this
(2:27:40) case masculinity right what what it is and what men should be doing with it i didn't say they should be i said that's
(2:27:45) my worldview okay your worldview mhm great if we dive into your worldview
(2:27:52) right and you have a proprietary definition this this definition meets no definition of masculine I've ever seen
(2:27:58) in my life i know okay yes so it's proprietary you agree yes so it's perfectly rational and logical for me to
() 
(2:28:06) go through your proprietary definition so that I can make sure it makes [ __ ] sense right i don't care if you think it
(2:28:12) makes sense give me a [ __ ] shot dude i can't I can't I give him the bottle you want the bottle how much is left
(2:28:18) [ __ ] you probably that chatter the one chatter is actually right you might be the dumbest [ __ ] person I've ever
(2:28:25) debated on this podcast and you're the most emotional wreck of a person I've ever seen you'd be emotional too if
(2:28:30) you're This like arguing with a [ __ ] kindergarter dude you don't even know what you're talking about can you pass her the You like literally don't know
(2:28:37) what you're talking about i don't care the whole point of the I don't care the whole point of the prompt was masculinity isn't a rigid thing and
(2:28:44) that's why I keep it very open yeah okay it's not a rigid thing but that doesn't tell us what it is okay all right uh
(2:28:51) let's see here we have We'll do a couple chats here really then get we'll get right back into a prompt we have Red Fox
(2:28:56) thank you Red Fox appreciate it red Fox donated $100 andrew holds a deep veneration for
(2:29:03) women and their contributions traditions deepen feminist
(2:29:08) what is the role and duty of women back my religion we venerate the theotokos you know that would be the mother of God
(2:29:15) but you know the thing is is even though I talk about this all the time discuss how much we need matrons in society how
(2:29:22) important it is I just hate all [ __ ] women no you see them as just breeders that's what you see them as yeah well
(2:29:28) it's just breeders that's what he said do you think women have any duty to No no no do men have duties sorry yeah no
(2:29:35) yeah men don't have duties no i think by my definition they should do the right thing but that's my belief that would be
(2:29:40) a duty [ __ ] adult okay fine yeah so what what duty so they have the duty to do the right thing let's let's not do
(2:29:46) insults no let's do insults what do What is What What duties do men have to do
(2:29:51) the right thing that's That's my view worldview so they have duties what women What What duties do women have none no
(2:29:57) okay okay we have a couple chats coming through here we got Where is it jordan it drives you insane yes it does drives
(2:30:04) him insane jordan Flores donated $100 andrew I'm sorry as a member of the
(2:30:10) Mexican community we don't claim the Fender General Vivo Crucible
(2:30:16) are you part of that maybe i'm half Mexican you could be Puerto Rican you could be I'm half Mexican okay but I
(2:30:23) would imagine the he's apparently Jordan Flores is the representative
(2:30:28) of all Mexicans who've ever lived he works on the consulate yeah no um he absolutely is probably another one of
(2:30:35) these single people that are angry so it's fine okay i mean you're married and seem pretty angry between the two of us
(2:30:41) i'm the one that seems angry andrew between the two of us 100 times the women you have so his
(2:30:47) sample size is far greater shouldn't you defer to that then since you love moo
(2:30:52) studies so much shout out you've interviewed a lot two I think 2,000 jeez
(2:30:59) 2000 when I know that's a lot that was kind of misogynistic and I've been here what have you learned i've been here for
(2:31:04) like half of that by the way why did you Why did you say G's when I interviewed 2,000 i'm just saying that's a lot of
(2:31:10) That seems a bit misogynistic how so it just seems a bit like wow you had to talk to 2,000 women i'm just surprised
(2:31:16) at the sheer number of women you've talked to no the way it came the way it came across sure but I'm explaining was
(2:31:23) it it was like I'm sorry that you had to it wasn't that i'm just asking you what you've learned in those 2,000 interviews
(2:31:29) what have you learned from them not a lot about women not much no just kidding i've learned a I've learned a
(2:31:35) lot I've learned a ton what have you learned share share something ask me at the end of the show and I'll tell you i
(2:31:41) don't want to I shouldn't be too involved in the convo hey you donated $100 the red pill isn't the problem it's
(2:31:48) a symptom of a larger issue where men have had negative experiences with modern women and are still villainized
(2:31:54) we find solidarity in our collective awakening thank you hey you this is
(2:31:59) exactly what I think is an honest assessment of what happens i said in my opening statement that red pill communities prey on men's rejection they
(2:32:07) prey on men's anger and I think that's true and I think they do find community in Red Pill i really do and I think
(2:32:14) that's why they flock there but I don't think it's effective for them i think it's keeping them lonely isolated and
(2:32:19) angry and they're not dating so if it's not working let's look for an alternative that's all I'm saying here let's get into that what's the
(2:32:25) alternative that's what we've been trying to get into this whole time you're trying to do some other [ __ ] semantic definition okay okay listen me
(2:32:32) asking you what masculinity is and you're saying fulfilling the general societal good [ __ ] is meaningless it
(2:32:40) is meaningless okay because I didn't come here to necessarily to talk about that i came here to talk about the Redfield community is destroying men's
(2:32:48) world debates are about world views no debates you play debate club and I'm not here for that dude it's not debate
(2:32:53) club you try to win debate points like there's some judges out there that's what you do you're not trying to have a
(2:32:59) real conversation about [ __ ] yeah I agree that I want my worldview to win and I want my worldview to win a debate
(2:33:05) but the thing is is like I don't even know what your worldview is cuz you can't explain it so your worldview is the red pill is working for men is that
(2:33:11) your worldview well that's what we're here arguing okay if you want to do an eternal critique of Christian ethics and
(2:33:17) my worldview I'm happy to do that we came here to talk about the red pill and manosphere community yes and so when
(2:33:24) you're asking me about the red pill what have I told you it is you said it's a data packet yes and so I can utilize and
(2:33:32) Christians can utilize this data packet as well right and we can introduce it through Christian ethics in a prism that
(2:33:39) helps men right only through Christian ethics that's what I would prescribe yeah but most people in red pill
(2:33:45) communities aren't Christian Orthodox they don't have to be Christian Orthodox well the point is is the red pill
(2:33:50) community helping men or is it hurting hold on is it Is the red pill community helping men or is it hurting them in your opinion ultimately I think it's
(2:33:57) more helpful than it's bad okay yeah but I would like to know what the alternative is
(2:34:03) turn off the red pill at least for now that's the only thing I What's the alternative to it though um I don't know consider trying to ask a girl out um
(2:34:10) maybe yeah they never thought of that they're not doing it Andrew yeah dude bro you literally just said with that
(2:34:16) chatter yeah that you agreed with his definition of what it was what the problem was i didn't say anything about
(2:34:21) definition hang on hang on that the way he said the problem was which is that they had bad experiences with women
(2:34:27) correct that means they're asking them out not necessarily then how are they having bad experiences with women maybe they're not getting success on dating
(2:34:32) apps i don't know that doesn't necessarily mean they're going up to women in the street and asking them out so they're so so they're they're having
(2:34:38) issues approaching women yes they're having issues dating with women yes men feel rejected so what's the alternative
(2:34:44) the alternative is hopefully more uh positive content coming out i hope my channel helps i hope other channels help
(2:34:50) it doesn't It's not telling me anything what's the alternative i don't have the definite alternative but I think the red
(2:34:56) the point is the red pill community is hurting men the red pill community is hurting people that's all I'm talking
(2:35:02) about but you said you were here to discuss the alternative i didn't say when did I say I was here to say I literally just wrote down alternative
(2:35:07) because you said right I have an alternative i said seek out alternative what's the alternative i don't know but
(2:35:13) there's not the red pill if it's not working get away from it if it's poison stop taking it that's the first [ __ ]
(2:35:18) step would you agree not a single alternative if you're taking like I said there's positive masculinity podcast out
(2:35:25) there that I would recommend listening to whoa really wait positive masculinity okay what is that um not the rigid sense
(2:35:32) that the red pill uh prescribes anything anything counter the red pill anything okay I'll just call it blue pill for the
(2:35:38) sake of your stupid definitions i'll call it blue pill blue pill the opposite of red pill how about that okay well
(2:35:44) what are they saying they're saying don't take the red pill that's what they're saying okay got it so let me ask
(2:35:49) you a question this is a a cool red pill talking point i wonder if you can refute
() 
(2:35:54) it do you think that um that men care about body count i think some of them do
(2:35:59) yeah would you no no you wouldn't care i wouldn't if she had [ __ ] 20,000 guys
(2:36:05) if I loved her I wouldn't care you wouldn't care 30 there's no number if I love somebody I don't care i don't care
(2:36:11) yeah what if she had sucked 20 guys dicks at once do you think that's going to change my
(2:36:17) answer i'm just curious i've already answered it if I cared about somebody I don't care no matter what correct as
(2:36:23) long as I don't have an STD I don't care do you think it's a legitimate preference that men have that they don't want women with high body counts i think
(2:36:29) any preference is legitimate if somebody has a preference they have a preference so so do you think that that's a legitimate preference sure i I said any
(2:36:35) preference is legitimate remember when I said that and then what do you think most men would consider a high body count to be i have no clue
(2:36:42) i don't I have no clue how would I know that okay fair enough do you think that most men would maybe consider 10 would
(2:36:49) probably be pretty high not necessarily no not in 2025 no you
(2:36:55) don't You don't think so i don't you don't think that that men would have a preference against being with a woman
(2:37:00) who's [ __ ] 10 different dudes before them some men would but not all men yeah so the men who would find that revolting
(2:37:08) what do you think they should do in 2025 when you just said there's not very many women who haven't had that find I didn't
(2:37:13) say there's not that many women that haven't had that i'm saying that that isn't necessarily body count for some people i didn't say every woman has that
(2:37:20) body count you didn't say every well then they should find somebody that doesn't have that body count that's what they What if Okay but what if it's the
(2:37:26) case that an overwhelming majority of women have that body count
(2:37:31) then men are [ __ ] out of luck I guess is that what you're saying so how are you helping them i'm saying that I don't
(2:37:37) think that's the case if that is the case and men don't want to change their preference then they won't find anyone today so you're So you're saying that if
(2:37:44) they have a preference against this that they should just change their preference i didn't say that so what should they do
(2:37:50) if they if if every woman is disqualified then they're not going to date
(2:37:55) so so if if it is the case then that promiscuity increases in society which
(2:38:02) that's what the trends are showing you at least agree with that promiscuity the trends show that that has been
(2:38:08) drastically increasing over the last I said I don't think it's that drastically different than it was when we were in
(2:38:13) college so no okay you don't think that you you don't think like of has
(2:38:18) increased since you were in college it doesn't necessarily mean they're banging a bunch of other dudes porn has been around for a long time yeah but the the
(2:38:24) thing is is the individualized form of it has not yeah but they're often with their own partners and stuff so it
(2:38:30) doesn't matter no they do BGV been around for a long time you remember all them like it's been around
(2:38:37) not even close to the same rates dude okay it's been around do you ever think we've been in in a situation like with Zoomers where it could be as as many as
(2:38:44) one in 10 women do porn ever okay ever
(2:38:49) like [ __ ] ever okay those are OF people that doesn't mean general women there are average people get married
(2:38:55) every day andrew it's not marriage is decreasing but it's still average people get married every day even if they're
(2:39:02) listen it happens so people are finding these people that aren't alive i agree that you should be going for good marriages but here's where our problem
(2:39:08) you should be going for good marriages but here's my problem my problem is is when we get into the preferences of men
(2:39:14) when you say we should be looking for alternatives let's have alternatives to red pill for men who have preferences i
(2:39:21) disagree with you and I think body count matters to men in a big way to some men yes yeah and I want to know what you
(2:39:28) would tell those men to do what would you tell them to do um if they're religious they probably can find somebody in their church that doesn't
(2:39:34) have a high body count i'm sure they can meet people when they're young and in college because like college people are dating and get married there's probably
(2:39:40) younger women out there that if you date them there's a lot of people that get married what about the 30-y olds they're not all I mean they're they don't necess
(2:39:47) not all women have high body count so I don't But you make it sound like they do because that's still like your your
(2:39:52) stick that's what that's what you do is make men think that all women are you know you're just saying that don't you
(2:39:59) don't you think that by the time most women are 25 they've had at least three sexual partners at least by the Maybe
(2:40:05) three maybe three at least three i'll grant three at least three i'll grant three yeah so So at least three i don't
(2:40:12) say at least i'll grant three you'll grant three but you won't grant five i can go to five okay five and don't you
(2:40:18) think that once you start getting into those numbers we're we're in like high body count territory for a lot of men it
(2:40:24) depends on what their preference is i have no idea if their preference is that they don't want a woman who slept with
(2:40:30) five men before them or had and remember this too a lot of these times you're
(2:40:35) sleeping with these these women are sleeping with these men they're long-term relationships right so you think that if men have legitimate
(2:40:41) preferences against all that baggage right you think they should be alone no i think they should find somebody that
(2:40:47) doesn't have that baggage if that's what matters to them do you think you think that there's enough of those out there for the amount of men i do you do and
(2:40:54) you think that those women want those men i think average people get married every day okay well yeah that's not my
(2:41:00) question well it answers your question so then how come how come you think that these uh these incelss can't find the
(2:41:06) women uh which are based around their preferences then I think a lot of people um either stay in their house and don't
(2:41:12) get out they don't meet people they don't ask people out in high school they don't ask people out in college i think that's a big problem with men today is
(2:41:18) that they're not asking women out i think that's a big big issue okay what So we'll just finish with this real
(2:41:25) quick and then I'll tie it all together for you what do you consider a marriageable woman for the average man
() 
(2:41:30) what is marriageable i can't prescribe that i have no idea well what do you think the average man
(2:41:36) would consider marriageable oh someone they really enjoy being around i don't know that's what I think
(2:41:41) they're looking for well there's going to be some things that you would agree with me they have to be like they
(2:41:47) probably have to be attracted to them sure right a trait like that they
(2:41:52) probably have to be attracted sure but there's But attraction comes in many ways well they'd have to probably be
(2:41:58) physically attracted to each other right to some degree but personality and humor can win a lot of people over yeah but
(2:42:04) you still have to be attracted to a person to want to [ __ ] them there's a lot of average people that get married
(2:42:09) every day Andrew yeah but that doesn't mean that they're not attracted to the other people okay they could be attracted beyond
(2:42:15) physical looks it It's It happens all the time yeah but the thing is just like it's really hard for a man's we need to
(2:42:20) get hard if it if if you're not physically not it's not it's really not
(2:42:26) so if you're not So you [ __ ] women you're not physically attracted to i'm saying most men find most women attractive you You think that men [ __ ]
(2:42:33) women they're not attracted to i think they find most women attractive yeah so like so so you think then that like um
(2:42:39) that men can just will themselves to [ __ ] attractive women it's called a slump buster
(2:42:46) i think a lot of men find a lot of women attracted and do you think they want long-term relationships with those women yes cuz they get married every day
(2:42:52) average people get married every day average doesn't mean you're not attracted to them though you keep on you make you're making a conflation yeah so
(2:42:58) like they have to be attracted at least right sure there has to be some attraction but again some physical attraction sure okay and do you think
(2:43:05) that there's like I don't know an obesity epidemic sure yeah and so doesn't that lower the rates of attract
(2:43:12) but aren't the 600 lb ladies married like you know aren't they married like it can happen yeah but they're usually
(2:43:18) married to like very very unattractive men as well right they're attracted to them so what does it matter no they're
(2:43:23) not always attracted to each other so they got married just for what no no no sometimes it happens in the marriage okay right sometimes it happens in the
(2:43:30) marriage they literally grow apart the point is people can find other people attractive people want to spend their
(2:43:35) lives with people but you don't want to push that message no what do you What do you mean i'm just talking about basic
(2:43:41) laws of attraction do you at least agree there has to be a trade of attraction sure but if 600 if 600 lb people can
(2:43:47) find a partner then I think a lot of people can find a partner one second i'm sorry
(2:43:52) i don't know what's going on here oh good quick little guys we're like 300 viewers away from 10,000 concurrent on
(2:43:59) YouTube guys if you're watching help us hit help us peak at 10,000 so anyway yeah so back to this so we agree that
(2:44:06) there's at least one trait are there any other traits for marriageable women uh sorry repeat the question i'm not really sure we agree there's at least one trait
(2:44:12) there has to be attraction is there any other men you're saying men need to find a woman attractive that's one of the criteria it's well at least one we could
(2:44:18) agree on there there has to be attraction some attraction yes okay what else for a marriageable woman um I think if they enjoy being around the person I
(2:44:25) think that's a big personality humor like same interest i think those are a big factor
(2:44:30) yeah okay they enjoy each other's company correct that's a big part of living together okay but uh so they
(2:44:36) enjoy each other's company what else um I don't know they have similar values
(2:44:43) um similar values they agree on similar household duties things like that okay
(2:44:48) so I agree i would say that that that one you nailed right there similar values is the thing that I hear the most
(2:44:55) from both men and women yeah right similar values so if you were to like I don't know ask a woman for instance
(2:45:02) about her political takes and they were completely the opposite of yours right you probably wouldn't want to be with
(2:45:08) that woman probably not and you probably shouldn't so like if you thought for instance that women shouldn't vote
(2:45:14) right and they thought that they should yeah you probably shouldn't date that person yeah so it seems like it's a pertinent dating question now uh no i'm
(2:45:21) saying that in red pill the only people who think women should invote are red pill people so I'm saying if they can
(2:45:27) get out of the red pill community they wouldn't be But you just said that preferences are a thing which are completely fine and you have no problem
(2:45:33) with anybody's preferences about anything okay yeah if these people similar values if they're like "Hey I don't think women should have the right
(2:45:39) to vote or I don't I don't think women should work," then yeah go ahead and go ahead and whittle those people out of
(2:45:44) your life go for it so just to make sure right you think that if it's your preference that you shouldn't be with
(2:45:50) women like that what percentage of the population what percentage of the population you the red pillars and those are the men you're trying to save
(2:45:56) they're the only ones that are aren't those the men you're trying to save yeah absolutely well but if their preference is to have these types of women why do
(2:46:02) you think them why do you think they don't want women to vote well I think that there's a they have good
(2:46:09) justifiable reasons for why they don't want anybody to vote okay that's what I think well like I said
(2:46:15) those are all the things that would make somebody I think viable and if they don't match the So how you going to Well how you going to save these guys if they
(2:46:20) have these preferences i don't get it didn't they find somebody your wife doesn't care about voting right you found somebody yeah I did do you think
(2:46:27) there's a lot of my wives out there i don't think there's a lot of you's out there well but there's a lot of red pillars right yeah but I don't think
(2:46:33) there's I don't think every single red pillar thinks they shouldn't vote the women should have vote you somehow that somehow you landed on that somehow and
(2:46:40) you found somebody who agrees with you um so I hope she convinced me yeah okay well I have hope that other guys can too
(2:46:47) then okay so then inside of the of the red pill community though you do agree that there's like a massive repeal the
(2:46:53) 19th movement sure and and if they find women that agree good for them i hope they do but they don't but they but they
(2:46:58) probably won't right okay well then they're they're going to be alone then so So then you don't really care about the loneliness of red pillars you just
(2:47:04) want them to change their preferences to meet your preferences there's a lot of people there's a lot of red pillars that might change their whole belief system
(2:47:10) after getting out of it go ahead change my belief system and say I'm Why is it that red pillars should get with women
(2:47:16) who want the right to vote i didn't say that that that's not what you have no prescriptions you have no [ __ ]
(2:47:22) prescriptions it's like talking listen no you listen no you listen you've been talking a [ __ ] prescription i just
(2:47:28) talked to you like that what are you going to [ __ ] do about it nothing yeah you heard me you [ __ ] heard me
(2:47:33) you're not going to do [ __ ] not trying to What are you trying to do now back to this what are you trying to do here nothing yeah you want to come hard we're
(2:47:40) doing it right coming hard by what i you just said don't you just said what are you gonna do right what are you okay
(2:47:46) what are you gonna do dude that is some insecurity I wouldn't say anything about that are you now are you gonna engage here or not repeal the 19th I don't
(2:47:53) think we should got it if you had a preference for it okay and a woman didn't probably shouldn't date right
(2:48:00) right that would make it a legitimate dating question that doesn't but that's not what you just said you said I don't care about red pillars because they if
(2:48:06) they can't find a woman that uh yeah you want them to conform to your preferences I didn't say conform to my preferences I
(2:48:11) said if they get out of the red pill community they might not believe these things anymore that's all I'm saying which would conform to to what your
(2:48:18) preferences i didn't say anything about my preferences you if the red pill if
(2:48:23) all these red pillars adopted your preferences like they don't care about body counts i don't [ __ ] about my preferences who cares about my
(2:48:29) preferences if they can't find a woman Hold on if they listen if they can't find a woman if they can't find a woman
(2:48:35) that doesn't match their preferences they get out of the red pill because it's not working for them they might change their beliefs i'm not prescribing
(2:48:40) a preference i'm prescribing getting out of the red pill that's what I'm prescribing so can you prescribe any alternative getting out of the red pill
(2:48:46) is the first step yeah that's not an alternative it is no that's just that listen it's like saying this um can your
(2:48:54) car is [ __ ] great but I need to drive to work can you tell me an alternative car no that's not the same thing i'm saying
(2:49:01) no it's not okay take the blue pill then how about that okay what's the blue pill it's the complete opposite of the red
(2:49:06) pill yeah that doesn't tell me anything what is it okay well you'll they'll figure it out okay they'll figure it out
(2:49:11) never any prescriptions at all no cuz I'm not coming here to prescribe anything but getting out of the red pill that's all but don't you understand that
(2:49:18) unless you give prescriptions for why that is because it's not helping them that's why yeah but you won't even tell
(2:49:23) us what the standard of helping them is what is it if they're unhappy with the current situation they're in because of
(2:49:28) the communities they're listening to get out of it tell us what the alternative community they'll be happy in first throw up the red pill that's the first
(2:49:34) step then we'll figure out if you're not happy with your shitty car then just get rid of the car what do I What do I get in nothing nothing yep stupid stupid
(2:49:42) it's so stupid yeah it is it's so dumb you have no alternatives it's so dumb yeah no prescription keep prescribing the red pill then keep prescribing it
(2:49:48) it's working for them i I prescribe Christian ethics you also prescribe the red pill no I just say that there's
(2:49:53) things about the red pill you ask me a specific narrow question has it done more good or more bad i think it's done
() 
(2:50:00) more bad that doesn't mean it's a prescriptor that I prescribe because I also understand it does more good than
(2:50:07) bad okay well you personally don't but the communities themselves do and the content creators do what does it have to
(2:50:12) do with anything what does that have to do with literally [ __ ] anything it has to do with what my came here to do
(2:50:18) okay what did you come here to do again to try to convince as many red pillars to get out do you think you're doing that i don't know maybe some people are
(2:50:23) listening do you think you're doing that i don't know maybe some of them might say "You know what it isn't working for me i'm going to get out." Maybe that's
(2:50:28) what they're thinking you would have been better coming in with a pro-Christian ethics message because that actually gets him out of the red
(2:50:34) pill okay sure yeah it does it does it a lot better
(2:50:40) that's why Muslims do a good job recruiting out of the red pillar manosphere it's why Christians do a good job secularist atheists who say "Ah no i
(2:50:47) don't give a [ __ ] if a woman's [ __ ] plowed 100 guys I'd still be with her anyway." That just turned off every
(2:50:52) [ __ ] who who is watching this I promise well that's fine but if if it is going to Christian ethics and that gives
(2:50:58) them a happier life and they're not depressed and they're not incels then hey go for it that's a prescription wait a second so maybe we can agree here
(2:51:07) should red pillars go towards Christian ethics i'm not prescribing that no but if it helps them go for it if then that
(2:51:13) would be a prescription no it's not there's several things they can turn to that aren't Christian ethics but if that
(2:51:19) is one of them I'm not saying that there's I don't know but I'm saying there are other alternatives if Christian ethics is one if you said if
(2:51:25) religion in general is one alternatives what I got here there's other alternatives yeah there's several people that live their lives in a secular way
(2:51:31) that aren't depressed and and you know incels there's several ways you can live a secular life that doesn't necessarily
(2:51:38) have this hard and fast philosophy that you believe in uhhuh there are people that can get out of it and choose a
(2:51:43) different path that's all I'm saying yeah you're just all you're offering up is more feminist degeneracy yeah degenerate it is degenerate i'm not
(2:51:51) promoting any sort of degeneracy what your worldview leads to is cohabitation and single motherhood and degeneracy
(2:51:57) that's all it ever leads to and what red pill content leads to is depression and red pill content leads to depression and
(2:52:02) it leads to loneliness and it leads to anger here's the thing if you have to do the alternative spectrum where we follow
(2:52:08) your view for cohabitation we already know what that does to men and it's way worse than if they never get married or
(2:52:13) if they do get married we know it for sure and your worldview your secularist [ __ ] worldview feminist worldview is
(2:52:19) what led us to this in the first place it was the erosion of religion the erosion of Christian ethics the erosion
(2:52:25) of uh having a patriarchal society we used to have 95% 95% they stayed intact
(2:52:31) thanks man oh now you care about them so much 95% what oh marriages you 95%
(2:52:37) because women were legally and economically trapped oh you think this is a better system yes okay well then why do you say you care about these men
(2:52:43) yes you You want them to be free of the red pill correct then why'd you put them in a [ __ ] society where they needed it okay that's Yeah they needed it
(2:52:50) because of feminism you're right blame women every chance you get blame women every chance you get andrew did I blame women or did I blame an ideology okay
(2:52:57) it's the same thing no it's not the same thing you just don't understand how to know nothing so again this whole society
(2:53:04) we had all of the things that you're prescribing men's health really good women's health really good yeah it
(2:53:11) really was and now not so much thanks to you [ __ ] yeah thanks to us so you want them to do the exact same [ __ ] same
(2:53:18) [ __ ] cohabitate have kids let the woman take over when it comes to uh abortions
() 
(2:53:25) right she can kill your kid not kill your kid totally up to her you [ __ ] deal with it and if she has a high body
(2:53:30) count just get over that preference yeah if the red pill's working for you if the red pill is working for you keep it if
(2:53:35) it's not get the [ __ ] out well here's the thing your lifestyle doesn't the lifestyle secularism which leads to the
(2:53:42) to um to degeneracy is what forced society into to this [ __ ] play anyway
(2:53:49) so you know what for I think a lot of men are angry that women have agency and they can live their own lives they can
(2:53:54) make income and these men are just upset about it that's what it is and the red pill was a good community for them to go to because they're rejected and they're
(2:54:00) angry so the red pill is what it is yeah so it's it has nothing to do with agency
(2:54:05) it has to do with the uh understanding of virtues oh yeah it's virtues that's the issue everyone's like man you think
(2:54:12) you think that gender is nebulous in fact everything is nebulous you're So when you say masculine or you say
(2:54:18) feminine those are nebulous terms to you but the thing is is like masculinity is not a nebulous term it's always been
(2:54:24) associated with virtue the same as femininity feminine virtues and
(2:54:29) masculine virtues the world changes yeah but the thing is it's like that forcing of the prog of of progression ideology
(2:54:36) progressive ideology exactly what got us here and all you're prescribing is more progressive ideology yeah the idea that
(2:54:42) women wanted to you know be lawyers and they couldn't 55 years ago yeah oh my god instead they took care of their own
(2:54:48) children we're forcing it oh we're forcing it down your throat oh my god let me ask you this god forgive people
(2:54:54) try to find their own would you rather this would you rather take away the ability of women to be lawyers if it
(2:54:59) meant that the human population continued to go cuz they stayed at home or were mothers or would you let humanity go extinct so that women could
(2:55:06) stay lawyers if they wanted to i don't know if a life is worth living if you don't have agency that's what I said i
(2:55:11) just No I don't i would rather women had the choice that's what I said and all of humanity go extinct so be it
(2:55:18) okay I think that's the end of the debate there's some other punks uh we
() 
(2:55:24) got some chats coming through guys if you want to get it in $100 TTS andrew's going for another smoke break there he
(2:55:30) goes uh he'll be right back guys we have Lucas thank you Lucas lucas donated $100
(2:55:36) appreciate it healthy masculinity equals biblical masculinity i.e highly
(2:55:42) competent patriarchal/familyoriented honorable unassalably virtuous courageous with
(2:55:49) impeccable integrity doesn't that sound like my definition a little bit beyond the Bible
(2:55:54) is is that your definition doing the right thing cuz it's the right thing like uh you know family oriented honorable virtuous courageous impeccable
(2:56:01) integrity I don't know okay we have Jason Castle here thank you Jason appreciate it jason Castle donated $100
(2:56:08) like I said definitely one of the dumbest guys Andrew has ever debated in
(2:56:14) order to have an actual debate you need to understand your opponent's worldview that includes their definition dummy
(2:56:22) i didn't come here to play the definition game that's Andrew's little tactic he does with every debate that's why these are five hours yeah but I mean
(2:56:28) don't you think it's fair that in order for you guys to have an understanding of what you're actually talking about you
(2:56:34) both can agree on a definition yeah I do agree but there's there's things that I
(2:56:40) think are are given that he tries to nitpick anyway like for example if I said I think women historically would be
(2:56:46) oppressed he would say "Well what's oppression?" And then it's like he knows what oppression is but he wants to play
(2:56:52) this semantic game which leads us down a road which makes him win argument points but it's like we both agree that women
(2:56:57) have been oppressed at some point so that's he might disagree but I I agree with you that he knows what well he has
(2:57:04) his own sense of or his own definition of oppression but he's just looking to you to give your own definition to make
(2:57:12) sure that you guys are talking about the same thing for example uh how would you uh and I'm not debating on Sure sure no
(2:57:18) I think I like this conversation no for sure how would you how would you define racism um I define racism as a
(2:57:24) systematic discrimination due to someone's identity mostly like I think prejudice and racism are two different
(2:57:30) things but for example some people and I don't know if you use this definition will use the following definition of racism racism equals prejudice plus
(2:57:37) power yeah I I I can I can agree with that is that your definition yeah I can I can agree with that yeah but many
(2:57:43) people in the original definition of racism that's not the original definition of racism so
(2:57:51) that's why I think he's trying to figure out the definitions of words because especially with words like oppression
(2:57:56) racism sexism if Oh my god I am is that really I have not been talking into the
(2:58:01) mic the entire time i had it turned around so I hope probably nobody heard what I was saying um my apologies so the
(2:58:09) definition of racism if it's prejudice racism equals prejudice plus power
(2:58:17) uh Andrew is not going to agree with you on that definition right but instead of providing his own definition he wants to
(2:58:23) pick apart mine and I think that's the [ __ ] that he does in debates if you don't agree with my definition provide
(2:58:29) your own huh you mean you win no you're winning debate club i'm trying to have a conversation you don't know what a
(2:58:34) conversation is you don't even have a worldview that's informed okay all you're doing is prescribing degeneracy all you do is believe in Christian
(2:58:40) ethics cuz it's your go the thing that worked for 2,000 years oh it's it worked so well yes it did for years why aren't we doing it still we we're trying to
(2:58:46) move society to it it's not going there yeah whatever half the world by 2050
(2:58:52) they're secularists are going to be more popular by 2050 they can't reproduce stupid they
(2:58:57) can't they can't [ __ ] we're the ones [ __ ] They're not no they're not do you want to know do you want to take a breakdown of population by secularists
(2:59:03) versus Christians not even from the same [ __ ] universe dude okay okay really quick really quick before we get right
(2:59:09) back into it i just want to read Dude I you got to let me go get some sleep man it's 24 hours cuz I've been up now how
(2:59:15) long have we been doing this uh like hours 3 hours it's time it's time we got
(2:59:20) to wrap it on this bro i'll be back tomorrow though 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes okay 30 minutes let me let at least let the chats come through really
(2:59:27) quick guys okay 30 minutes uh so yeah we'll do 30 minutes if you want final time final opportunity $99 TTS also
(2:59:34) really quick guys we're like 200 viewers away from hitting 10,000 concurrent viewers let me ask you this too join us
(2:59:40) really quick is there any degeneracy you're against any i'm sure like
(2:59:46) homosexuality no I'm not against that female promiscuity no I'm not against that okay um are you against male
(2:59:53) promiscuity no okay no male promiscuity are you against uh like three men in a
() 
(3:00:01) homosexual relationship adopting a child no no not against that either um what degeneracy would you be against i can
(3:00:09) give me examples i'll tell you maybe necroilia like what what you draw the line at dead bodies that's one that's it
(3:00:15) i That's the one I could think of i'm sure there's more what about incest uh yeah i I think that's degeneracy you
(3:00:21) think that is so can you tell me why it is you think two brothers shouldn't be able to have sex it just doesn't sit
(3:00:27) right with me no okay it just doesn't and none of this sits right with anybody the idea The idea that you So all you've
(3:00:33) prescribed for society is the same exact thing that these guys have been dealing with for the last 50 years which is just
(3:00:40) an unlimited amount of degeneracy what new you know what let me just ask this what new are you actually bringing to
(3:00:45) the table are you bringing any new idea other than just I'm a progressive and do whatever the [ __ ] you want are you
(3:00:51) bringing anything i think my channel is showing that the red pill myths that they're being told about women isn't
(3:00:57) necessarily true so I'm bringing that and people have told me that it's helping so okay that's what I'm bringing to the
(3:01:03) table well it looks to me like all you're bringing to the table is just more progressive degeneracy it looks to
(3:01:08) me like all you're bringing to the table is a return to the 1950s no I'm Well here's the thing 1950s so good right hey
(3:01:14) in the 1950s what did you think about the lack of mental illnesses there yeah I'm sure there weren't any mental illnesses or maybe we didn't know how
(3:01:21) comparison to the 1950s were so great let's just go back what was so what what about the interpersonal relationships in
(3:01:27) the 1950s did you hate so much what were they you don't know do you yeah you don't know no all you bring to the table
(3:01:33) is let's go back in time that's all you bring to the table oh I'm sorry you're You're upset that I used tradition do I seem upset what's What's a tradition do
(3:01:39) I seem upset yeah it seems like an experiment that worked oh did it yeah that's what a tradition do you have
(3:01:46) family traditions not really none not that I can think of no oh would you agree with me that a tradition could
(3:01:52) easily be looked at as an experiment which worked not necessarily well I mean
(3:01:57) why would you have them if they don't work i don't know is the Christmas tree a tradition does it work yes it works and here's what it works for has no
(3:02:03) application it works for the assistance of people getting around a Christmas tree and celebrating an event
(3:02:10) and it works so well that it spread like wildfire and everybody started doing it
(3:02:15) it was a great way to assist with community seems like a tradition that worked richard Dawkins who was a very
(3:02:20) famous atheist said he really misses Christmas carols he did everything he could to eliminate Christianity but he
(3:02:25) really misses Christmas carols yeah well you can celebrate Christmas without being Christian sure you're just going
(3:02:30) to steal from our ethics like always and then you know degenerize them yeah sure but Okay did you want them by the way I
(3:02:37) order food i I was going to get us food after the show or No I need sleep no
(3:02:43) just checking i was going to I was going to order some food Andrew going to get you a burger all right let me let the chats come through uh I'm sure the
(3:02:49) audience can tell I'm [ __ ] tired too christopher Scott donated $100 and I wonder why men feel disheartened
(3:02:56) in society could it be the solid 20 to 30 years of telling them they're monsters predators and # unalive all men
() 
(3:03:04) no it's all Red Pill's fault i think that's horrible i don't think people
(3:03:10) should make men feel terrible but I think what's happening with Red Pill is that it's becoming a dehumanization of
(3:03:17) women and it's becoming demonizing women and I don't think that's going to help either so I don't agree that men should
(3:03:24) be berated like that but I also don't think women should either okay we have Jordan Flores here this is the Mexican
(3:03:31) guy jordan Flores donated $100 the representative of married for 10 years and four kids again Andrew not all of us
(3:03:40) Mexicans are as stupid as this one some of us understand how to follow a simple
(3:03:45) argument you got something to say about Mexicans yes what is it go ahead the mic's right
(3:03:51) there well I'm not going to say they're all stupid as you what the [ __ ] oh
(3:03:57) whoops uh okay i'm not going to say that that's too much but like the term stupid Mexican is
(3:04:04) pretty funny it's pretty funny dude if you want to help sincerely then try to understand sincerely andrew brings up
(3:04:11) good points and you remain evasive it doesn't help anyone
(3:04:16) well as I was telling uh Brian when Andrew went for a smoke if I give a definition of something he doesn't agree
(3:04:22) with it he can provide his own but instead he wants to play a semantic definition game and it's [ __ ] so I don't like playing that game with him
(3:04:28) i'm not it's It's really funny because I can be super pedantic with semantics
(3:04:34) that's true but in this case you by your own admission said it's my own
(3:04:39) definition meaning it's proprietary i have every business in the world exploring that to make sure that
(3:04:46) it is pointing at the thing that we both understand it's trying to point to but it's not you keep it the re see it's
(3:04:52) actually you playing semantic games because if you would narrow and hone on what the definition was we wouldn't have
(3:04:58) to waste so much [ __ ] time on it so I understood what it is you're trying to play if you just were provide your definition and we could find a middle
(3:05:04) ground we can also look forward to your position i don't prove your position exactly this is the debate club [ __ ]
(3:05:09) that I'm talking about yes it's a debate it's an ideological debate between world it's a debate club you're playing some for some [ __ ] stupid ass points
(3:05:15) destiny triangles destiny triangles you're trying to play for some points that aren't real all right we have Chaw
(3:05:20) here thank you cha Ch XD donated $100 these secular idiots are driving
(3:05:27) more men to Red Pill than even the most prolific Red Pill podcasters they offer
(3:05:33) you nothing no duty no prescriptions no virtue just generate hell on earth just
(3:05:39) degeneracy it's all they ever prescribe so as you mentioned that Myron Gaines is a degenerate and he's promoting stuff so
(3:05:44) what virtue is he promoting or what uh duty is he at least Myin when you sit down and talk to him about virtues and
(3:05:52) about Christian ethics and about duty he'll at least concede on these grounds
(3:05:57) you literally just said the whole [ __ ] world can can just go ahead and die off if that means women can't be
(3:06:03) lawyers like you're in a [ __ ] different world of crazy okay all right
(3:06:09) got iron thank you iron Manny donated $100 no names way yell and trump

(3:06:39) if you want we'll do a roast session after this donated $699
(3:06:45) leave i'll continue he talked [ __ ] behind your back Andrew like a woman please pick up the mic what are you not
(3:06:51) shocked about this kid behind a divorce did I talk [ __ ] behind his back Brian as a teenager what did you say to you were
(3:06:58) here whenever I was talking to you i mean I came in and you were talking [ __ ] when I wasn't here all Andrew does
(3:07:04) is blah blah blah blah that's talking [ __ ] it's kind of like I don't remember yeah that I mean that's definitely Even when I was walking in I heard you talk
(3:07:10) me and Brian were having a conversation about how you don't give a definition and that's not talking [ __ ] bro wait I didn't say that no I said we were
(3:07:16) talking about it i That's what I was saying bro when Okay yeah we were talking about it so he got to the whole
(3:07:21) first part of this debate you go rewind it later and you need to that was me on defense and I gave you every opportunity
(3:07:29) to examine my worldview when we got to your positive claims you refused to answer a single [ __ ] question it was ridiculous question for both of you uh
(3:07:36) there were a bunch more prompts would you guys do a round two yeah like a
(3:07:43) different day yeah a different day just cuz uh you know Andrew he's been up for 24 hours we've already done 3 hours i
(3:07:49) get it but if you're down to come back we'd love Andrew if you'd like to do it again we can you know it was uh
(3:07:55) entertaining i can't wait i can't wait to hear more about how degeneracy is going to save society i can't wait to hear uh let's define this and let's
(3:08:02) define that let's uh how do you define this and what I'm not going to provide my It's not the rules i don't the rules
(3:08:07) if you if you want to cross examine my provide your I asked you to provide a definition you didn't do it it's because
(3:08:13) it's your position it doesn't matter if we don't agree with I need to give you a definition for your [ __ ] position dude i gave you my definition and if you
() 
(3:08:20) didn't agree with it tell me yours it's that simple it's not It's not debate rules i know it's not the debate rules
(3:08:26) we can't have a real conversation it's illogical it's not illogical i have a If you don't agree with my position tell me
(3:08:33) yours and maybe we can find a middle ground but that's not how that's not how you debate that's not how you talk that's not how anybody debates that's
(3:08:38) how a lot of people have conversations critique listen even inside of conversations all you're really doing is
(3:08:44) debating it's just that you refuse to formalize it because you're terrified of
(3:08:49) where your [ __ ] thoughts lead so what you do instead is filibuster refuse to answer questions refuse to allow me to
(3:08:54) even even understand what it is that you're talking about with a proprietary definition i also have seen enough of
(3:09:01) your debates that I know when you go down the the morality rabbit hole what's your what morality do you do subscribe to oh I'm Christian ethics oh well you
(3:09:08) don't have any kind of relevant you know is relevantism it's the same [ __ ] you do every [ __ ] debate so I'm not doing it i I literally told you I wasn't
(3:09:15) going to get into morality but if we went down that hole you can't help yourself you can't help yourself you do
(3:09:20) it every debate but here's the No I don't not only that not only do I not especially in political debates there's
(3:09:27) never a reason to in this case we never really got into morality at all just your prescriptions for society which
(3:09:33) were just like I know everybody can do whatever the [ __ ] they want on a bridge you're gonna say it's moral relativism is No it's just it's just Crowley it's
(3:09:40) just do as thou wilt it's the same [ __ ] we've been dealing with for 60 years you're not helping nothing okay all right a few more chats coming through we
(3:09:46) got Birdman $69 TTS donated $69 thank
(3:09:52) you when you leave the debate you're going to leave with your definition so Andrew is working with your definition
(3:09:58) you're playing the semantics game not Andrew exactly i'm trying to be clear so we're not playing semantics or
(3:10:04) equivocating see the biggest thing and like now the audience can see this firsthand why this becomes so
(3:10:10) frustrating for people like me is with equiv equivocation they'll move between
(3:10:15) the like a tube of toothpaste they don't want you to pin them down on the [ __ ] they actually believe i said from the
(3:10:20) beginning that masculinity should not be rigid and I don't have a strict definition so I can't pin down any
(3:10:25) beliefs don't pin it down share yours right share yours if you want my definition of masculinity sure if you
(3:10:31) want to finally share it let's go for it so my definition of masculinity and my definition of femininity are going to be
(3:10:38) tied to virtues okay so here's what I mean by this if you have male virtue
(3:10:44) right and female virtue all virtues are going to be united in in the way that
(3:10:49) men and women both need to have courage for instance okay but if it is the case that the effects on society when one
(3:10:56) gender specifically lacks whatever that virtue is over the other and the results are either more devastating or more
(3:11:02) positive that would be a masculine trait versus a feminine trait interesting say that one more time so if
(3:11:09) let's you said courage is something that both masculine I don't want to answer anymore about this i can't believe this
(3:11:14) i can't [ __ ] believe that i just gave you my definition i just gave it to you
(3:11:20) why are you asking me more about it it's because I don't understand i don't Well I didn't understand yours but that Oh
(3:11:25) I'm sorry i'm not questioning it no I'm not i'm not answering any more questions about my definition that's fine go for
(3:11:30) it not answering anymore i wasn't questioning your definition i'm just trying to make sure it make sure I heard
(3:11:37) it right you're trying to understand it so you're trying to understand it so that you I didn't ask you what's courage did I yeah no but the thing is it's like
(3:11:43) you're asking me follow-up questions about the definition rightly so because I didn't understand it but you're you're
(3:11:48) saying what's good i didn't ask you what courage was i didn't ask you what courage you didn't need to you were trying to get an elaboration you said
(3:11:55) that's interesting let's dive in on this a little more yeah look at that it's almost like you want to hone in
() 
(3:12:00) definitionally on my worldview which is smart the way I approach that is so different from the way you approach it and you [ __ ] know it it's a
(3:12:06) conversation no it's not the same [ __ ] something dude had the best faith debate ever you are not a good faith debater
(3:12:13) all you had to do you're not a good faith all you had to do is you're not a good faith where you asked me the definition i gave it to you i would have
(3:12:18) continued you are notoriously a bad faith according to who to everyone who's debated you somebody who's debated you
(3:12:24) someone who's not leftist no anyone who's debated you anyone anyone who's that literally anyone who's anyone i've
(3:12:30) never debated anybody tommy Lauren thinks you're a good faith debater tommy Lauren whatever the [ __ ] her name is a
(3:12:36) leftist tommy Lauren tommy Lauren yeah leftist she's not a leftist oh yeah she is okay here we go now she's a leftist
(3:12:41) she's a progressive yeah yeah sure she's a progressive yeah I called her out for being a feminist she's still pissed about it to this day no because you're not a good faith debater that's why and
(3:12:47) did did she ever call me bad faith you're not a good faith did she ever call me bad faith i'm sure she thinks it
(3:12:52) did she ever call me that i'm sure she thinks she made it up she said she still pissed you you just made it up you just made it up so you made it up she's still pissed right she's still pissed yeah but
(3:12:58) that doesn't mean I'm bad faith cuz she's pissed why would Why would she be pissed if it's not if it's debate in a debate debates cuz you called her a
(3:13:05) [ __ ] name it's cuz you called her a [ __ ] name you know what happens so women can be lawyers i want people to
(3:13:11) have agency and if that costs humanity then what what's life worth living exactly if either they could be lawyers
(3:13:17) or lawyers I said agency it's not that specific Andrew I said I said agency
(3:13:22) yeah because it it ties into agency right so then so what you're saying again they better be able to be lawyers
(3:13:28) you're stronging my argument my argument is anyone who has if you can't have agency in your life I don't care if
(3:13:33) humanity goes off the cliff that's what I'm saying okay how much agency I don't
(3:13:38) know oh agency though whatever that means a choice to equality basically equal opportunity that's what I'm saying
(3:13:45) but men don't have equality equality and abortion you're fine with it equal opportunity yeah men don't have equality in abortion you're fine with equal
(3:13:50) opportunity i said not equality yeah men don't have equal opportunity with abortion either you're fine with it well they're not the ones giving birth so of course they don't have equality if they
(3:13:56) are the ones who are on the If they want to give birth if they want to give equal opportunity to give birth then yeah let's go for it no how about just equal
(3:14:02) opportunity to have a say in whether or not their kid is born or not but it's not an equal opportunity for them because they can't provide they can't
(3:14:07) they don't need to to have the equal opportunity god they can't that's what laws are we can we can literally outlaw
(3:14:12) abortion tomorrow so you would rather there not be no world than an abortion outlawed i didn't say that well you're
(3:14:19) destroying agency and equity right is that your position though no my position is not because I I have But women won't
(3:14:24) have agency that's not the same thing man why same [ __ ] they won't have agency
(3:14:30) they won't have agency not the same thing if women can't have abortions they don't have agency now the agency that men have that's what I'm saying the
(3:14:36) agency that other people have if you can't have that then no I don't think whatever like so like abortion you can't
(3:14:42) have an abortion no I didn't say that yeah but if you can't have an abortion how's that not limiting agency
(3:14:47) because other if no one can have an abortion then other no one can have an abortion that's it and if if men have a
(3:14:53) say and women have a say then both of them have a say and that's it no my point is if a men have agency in one
(3:15:00) thing and women have the same opportunity to have the same agency then they should like with a child being born
(3:15:05) no because men don't have agency around child birth at all yes they should have it no they don't cuz they don't they don't get pregnant they don't get
(3:15:11) pregnant yes it's still their kid still their kid of it after it's done after it doesn't it doesn't matter okay so then
(3:15:18) by that logic then if you were going to implant I don't know your egg and se
(3:15:23) your wife's egg and then your semen into another woman and she agreed to it and it gets 6 weeks down the road is she
(3:15:30) should she be able to abort that kid if she doesn't want to go through with the pregnancy it sucks but yeah
(3:15:36) okay no I at least I'm consistent good lord let's finish the chats if we can all right we got Lulu Lulu here thank
(3:15:44) you Lulu Lulu lulu donated $100 dude stop dismissing this debate club you
(3:15:51) came on to a debate we all expecting a debate that's like going to a funeral
(3:15:57) cracking jokes or going to a party with bad vibes a debate can be several things it doesn't have to be this prescriptive
(3:16:03) rules that Andrew likes to play debate can be a back and forth we got Lucas coming in here we got Lucas coming
(3:16:09) in and we got Rachel Wilson in just a moment with the chat if you want to get it in we lowered it we're doing a $69
(3:16:15) TTS lucas donated $100 this is a roast session hey soy boy exclamation mark do
(3:16:21) you really think you changed in a single mind today with a vapid pratt are you
(3:16:26) that out of touch men have categorically rejected your world view did you see the
(3:16:31) election for potus yeah that's one election but I you guys
(3:16:36) aren't aren't headed for more it's fine did you vote Biden oh we're not huh i absolutely did did you see what happened with abortion we're not heading for more
(3:16:43) though did you see what's in the Supreme Court right now where they're about to maybe limit anchor babies we're not heading for more though okay yeah yeah
(3:16:48) we'll see how long this lasts yeah we'll see how long it [ __ ] lasts all right we got Jag here doesn't care about logic or the end of humanity uh sick and
(3:16:56) demented human thank you Jag 48 for the super chat appreciate it uh and then we
(3:17:02) have Brian S riddle me this if all I need to do is read a book to get better what good are psychologists also Soy
(3:17:09) Boy's month old channel is so informative about how bad the red pill is that he gives his guests the subject
(3:17:15) matter to discuss i don't get that last part you're you're In other words you're feeding them
(3:17:21) answers and information is what he's saying oh uh now I don't know if that's true or not but that's what he's saying
(3:17:27) he's not also I want to address that no I don't think it's just the book it's the same thing like with going to the
(3:17:33) gym that I liken it to if you go to the gym to work out your body um you know a
(3:17:38) protein shake helps for example like reading supplementary material I think helps same way with uh therapy if you're
(3:17:44) going to therapy to work on like the mental gym books uh are supplements to that that's how I feel all right uh
(3:17:52) we'll do closing statements after we get through the rest of these chats there's about five does this guy realize that
(3:17:58) there's cause and effect there's a reason for the red pill it's not all on men we didn't cause it alone so we can't
() 
(3:18:06) fix it alone what responsibility do women have well I got his official answer for that on page you don't have
(3:18:12) my official answer you said none no he he responsibility I think to the red
(3:18:17) pill that's duty you said to the red pill i'm talking about if we're trying to fix this divide that's what he's
(3:18:22) talking about so I'm saying if the red pill Yes I agree it is a cause and effect men have been rejected they're
(3:18:29) angry and red pill is is a community that they feel they can confide in i think what needs to happen is I also
(3:18:35) think a lot of misandry is also a a reaction to the red pill that we're seeing more uh more prominent and I
(3:18:41) think that's a problem too um so I think if we want to get people back together we have to stop being so extreme and I
(3:18:48) think we have to stop demonizing each other and I think that's both men and women erroneous erroneous which part's
(3:18:54) erroneous mis misandry being a response to red pill to misogyny wouldn't wait
(3:19:00) what i think red pill is a very misogyny space you said that misogyny was the response and so then if Miss Andre's
(3:19:07) response to the misogyny then that would mean that it was Miss Andrew that caused the misogyny how does that work well
(3:19:12) because what caused the misogyny rejection rejection and men being men
(3:19:18) being demonized that's not I didn't I said if I said the misandry now they need to stop demonizing i don't think
(3:19:24) that was the reason misogynist content started coming up misogynist it started coming up because men felt rejected and
(3:19:29) they and and these guys pray on that rejection by saying victimized no I'm I'm in the middle of speaking so these
(3:19:35) people are they're praying they're praying they're praying on people that are are rejected and angry they're
(3:19:41) praying on people that are rejected and angry and so they're saying "Hey I can help you self-improve." And by the way women suck don't they that's what Red
(3:19:47) Pill does okay rachel Wilson donated $69
(3:19:54) male feminism is a mating strategy for beta males they try to blend in with the women and seem non-threatening if this
(3:20:01) guy really respected women he would respect me and not lie about my husband
(3:20:07) i don't think I disrespected her in any way okay no he said she's saying that the disrespect is when you lie about me
(3:20:14) i don't think I lied about you either yeah yeah i mean when you say bad faith those are all lies you're a bad faith
(3:20:20) debate no you just don't know how to debate you're a bad faith debate you not knowing how to debate doesn't mean I'm bad faith the people who do know how to
(3:20:26) debate they'll call you a bad faith debate which ones oh not the liberal ones yeah so the conservative ones who
(3:20:31) all become my friends after and come to me for debate lessons they don't think I'm bad faith though huh just the ones who hate my political ideology that's
(3:20:38) awful [ __ ] convenient it's awful convenient that and by the way I've seen this on the other side too tons of
(3:20:44) right-wing people are like "Destiny's bad faith." I remember him putting out a post saying "At this point I reject bad faith because it just means you lost the
(3:20:51) debate." And you know what i tend to [ __ ] agree with him on that well that's good that you and Destiny agree on something god b Lucas donated $69

(3:22:32) if that's a contractual agreement then fine then what if they have a contractual agreement with the woman before they That's okay so so then if it
(3:22:40) is the case that men began to have women sign contracts that if they got pregnant
(3:22:45) the men bore no responsibility if Hang on hang on i just want let me finish the question okay right that men bore no
(3:22:52) responsibility whatsoever and they signed it you would want the state to not be to to enforce that right yeah if

(3:23:55) you're going to go first with your closing statement andrew you have final word my closing statement is simple if
(3:24:02) the red pill is working for you by all means continue consuming the content but if it's not I implore you to seek other
(3:24:08) alternatives if you are depressed um if you're lonely um I encourage you to seek
(3:24:14) help um because a lot of the people in this community are struggling and I hate to see it and the people I talk to that
(3:24:20) are in this community that say you know you're giving me hope for the first time that's all I'm trying to do and maybe I
(3:24:26) didn't make the best argument because I'm not a debater i came here with a specific purpose and it's to try to help men in the red pill and if I did great
() 
(3:24:33) if I didn't oh well so be it i gave it a shot
(3:24:38) all right Andrew uh go ahead with your closing statement well all it all just comes down to ignorance so the the ideas
(3:24:46) just haven't been thought through by my opponent i don't think he's a bad person ultimately though he does really
(3:24:53) advocate for a lot of degeneracy um but what is what's new what's he bringing you that's new like
(3:24:59) what what is he saying to you he's saying what um basically the only things I could really get out of him was switch
(3:25:05) up your preferences and I don't really have a good definition of masculinity or a good definition of femininity i don't
(3:25:10) have anything that's rigid that sounds basically like gender abolition essentially that's what it sounded like
(3:25:16) to me okay he's shaking his head so yeah probably something akin to that this is all just progressive ideology repackaged
(3:25:23) i actually care about incelss i actually care about [ __ ] uh people you know men i actually They don't give a [ __ ]
(3:25:30) here's the thing right it all comes down to this the truth is is that you all of
(3:25:36) you in this audience are a threat to progressive ideology and so they're going to tell you that the people who
(3:25:41) are the closest to your ideology who represent your worldview uh are the bad
(3:25:46) guys and the enemy and this and that and then when they give you the prescriptions what do they give you [ __ ] nothing what are the
(3:25:51) alternatives he said "I don't know what should we do i don't know what's masculinity i don't know what's feminine
(3:25:56) i don't know right if I try to get a definition out of him I'm being bad faith if I debate too good I'm bad faith
(3:26:02) if I do any of these things I'm bad faith if if I even want to finish a sentence I'm bad faith all of this just
(3:26:09) leads me to this it comes from a state of ignorance and he doesn't realize he's prescribing the same [ __ ] that got us
(3:26:15) here to begin with if we go back and we see the what does he say he says the same thing feminists say to me all the
(3:26:20) time right he wants to take us back to the 1950s and if you ask him like okay
(3:26:25) well actually let's just say I was what's so bad about the 1950s anyway well I don't know you know I don't know
(3:26:31) anything i just I'm I don't know anything i'm not really here to prescribe anything i just [ __ ] don't know nothing and it's like well okay
(3:26:39) that's fine but the difference between this guy and Destiny is well the thank god for him he doesn't I hope I don't
(3:26:46) think you don't let you're not in an open relationship right okay good good the difference between him and Destiny
(3:26:51) is like yeah maybe he doesn't let people plow his wife but his prescriptions for things like this are just unfettered
(3:26:57) degeneracy it's like do what do whatever you want it's the Crowley and do as thou wilt there is no duties there is no
(3:27:03) virtues right all these things are very fluid and then and then we just end up with well just kind of do what works and
(3:27:09) it's like well then if that's the case the then even if this didn't work what
(3:27:15) alternative would work i don't know so the whole thing is incoherence nonsense it's not that I don't like this guy it's
(3:27:22) just that like it's very frustrating for me because I'm literally here to oppose
(3:27:28) this very ideology and I don't even get the benefit of having him [ __ ] even tell me what it is cuz he doesn't know
(3:27:35) and so it's like it's sitting there squeezing a tube of toothpaste it moves there then he pin it down it moves here
(3:27:40) and so it's like can I even match my worldview for prescriptions against his i can't because I'm willing to give them
(3:27:46) and he's not and that's it can I add one more thing
(3:27:52) you can't add it after close dude if Andrew is willing to grant it otherwise it's it's kind of in your benefit i
(3:27:57) think I'm I'm trying to like So maybe I don't have the exact thing that I can prescribe to get out of the red pill but
(3:28:03) if it is Christianity if it is that kind of community then I implore you to do that you know like that's totally fine
(3:28:10) oh yeah well let me ask this last question then since since I get the last word on this one yeah what if it's the case that Christianity was 10 times more
(3:28:17) oppressive towards women than anything the red pill wanted to do but it made men feel a lot better would you
(3:28:22) prescribe it then probably not yeah I didn't think so so yeah he's right come
(3:28:27) over to Christianity especially based based as traditional Christianity they
(3:28:33) are way worse when it comes to the question of egalitarianism than any of the [ __ ] Red Pillars could ever dream
(3:28:38) of and he hates it and he should so uh before you leave here right now Andrew
(3:28:44) really quick here's what we'll do um so it sounds like you're both open to doing a round two uh so we'll maybe schedule
(3:28:52) that for a future date and also Andrew is going to take off but guys if you
(3:28:57) want to stay tuned for a little bit Raphael is going to stick around for a little bit and we're going to do a
(3:29:02) little roast session and if any of you have any questions for Raphael you're welcome to uh stay tuned but Andrew
(3:29:09) needs to get some some Z's he needs some Z's i am sorry i am sorry unless you want a burger i can get you i'm always
(3:29:14) I'm always a good sport i always stay for for all these shows and stuff but I'm just so [ __ ] tired today because
(3:29:21) of all this travel but I will see you tomorrow refreshed right and Brian doesn't know it yet but he needs me at
(3:29:26) my at my best this is No we do need Andrew fresh and speaking of which final thing here before Andrew leaves we have
(3:29:32) Andrew for a debate tomorrow on Friday we have him for a debate on Saturday
(3:29:37) we're doing a dating talk panel Sunday we have a debate on Monday and then we
(3:29:42) have a special show Tuesday on Tuesday so this is a long week so I know maybe you guys would have liked to have seen
(3:29:48) this go a bit longer but you know we got to recuperate a bit so uh Andrew thank you so much for coming and for those of
(3:29:54) you who who might be listening you're like you know [ __ ] Andrew is being a wuss look I literally I didn't sleep i
(3:30:00) haven't slept for basically 24 hours i got off a plane and came right here to do this debate so like a little mercy
(3:30:07) from the chat i know that all of them are going to spam L's anyway and I deserve it but little mercy you know what though if M for mercy if you guys
() 
(3:30:16) keep the roast going for about 7 8 hours once Andrew wakes up and if we're still
(3:30:23) going that's probably not going to happen but uh Andrew thank you for coming we're going to continue the roast session always pleasure to have you uh
(3:30:29) see you next time yeah and uh you know we need to put I feel like we need something there but anyways um I'm going
(3:30:36) to let some of the there's more chats coming through i'm going to let them come through uh let's see here Raphael
(3:30:42) let's see what the viewers are saying one sec guys it's taking me a sec to uh
(3:30:47) get it pulled up here we have a question from the
(3:30:54) Glockavius he says "This [Music] Glavius donated $69
(3:31:02) is it straight to date a transgender woman would you date a transgender woman
(3:31:07) that uh that's for you i personally wouldn't and I I don't know i think it's maybe it's it's in the queer territory i
(3:31:14) have no idea i don't know how to define it is it straight though uh I don't know i don't know if how to I don't know if
(3:31:19) I'd be able to define that no andrew grab one of those beers on your way out by the way one of the beers from the
(3:31:25) refrigerator if you'd like okay thank you Glavius for that uh we have this he has a follow-up question for you
(3:31:31) gloavius donated $69 do you think black people can be racist towards white people do you think
(3:31:39) women can be sexist towards men if not define racism and sexism
() 
(3:31:46) um no because I think racism and sexism often involves prejudice plus power so
(3:31:52) if you're let's say I'm going to make an example and this is a wild example but let's say you're afraid of a certain minority group you don't want to walk on
(3:31:58) the same side of the street as them i consider that prejudice but if that same person comes in for a job at your
(3:32:03) company and you say "No I'm not going to hire you because of this." That's what I consider racist so it's similar with sexism as well same for both same for
(3:32:10) both prejudice power prejudice plus power for their identity okay all right that's from Glactavius um well if not Oh
(3:32:18) well you did define it then you did define racism as sexism prejudice plus power is there any scenario in which a
(3:32:25) woman could be sexist towards a man uh if she's empowered to do so yes okay so she owns a company and she refused to
(3:32:31) hire men that would be sexist okay all right uh there's some consistency there then we have Arch Duke France archduke
(3:32:39) France Fartinand $69 a female politician said "Women have
(3:32:45) always been the primary victims of war women lose their husbands their sons in combat." Do you
(3:32:53) agree that women are the primary victims of war i mean I think most men die in war so I
(3:33:00) I don't see how they're the primary victims but I do think war has casualties for each gender for sure so
(3:33:07) would you say men are the primary victims of war i think so i mean do people say otherwise uh well so that
(3:33:13) quote's actually from uh Hillary Clinton oh she said that [ __ ] in the 90s and she actually repeated it again a like a year
(3:33:22) or two ago in relation to the Ukraine war um women have always been the primary victims of war that's what she
(3:33:28) said would you agree with Do you agree with her or disagree i don't think I agree with that but I haven't put any more thought into it but I just feel
(3:33:34) like if men are the mass casualties of war then they're probably the biggest victim I would imagine just from a quick
(3:33:40) thought we got more chats coming through really quick though before we do that uh guys Venmo Cash App whatever pot if you
(3:33:46) want 100% of your contribution to go towards the show like the video please also mayor if you could pull up Twitch guys go to twitch.tv/ whatever on your

(3:34:26) roast Raphael roast roast Raphael maybe roast him a little bit boy better cook let's go you roast him roast him all
(3:34:33) right we have tone police patriarchy here we go thank you for this oh thank
(3:34:38) you for that tone police patriarchy donated $69 reformed feminist here red pill
(3:34:46) saved me feminist ideology brought several of my peers to take matters into their own hands your view of red pill is
(3:34:54) incorrect dig deeper please great show gentlemen thank you Tone police
(3:35:00) patriarchy that's interesting i mean look if whatever ideology is driving you to be depressed lonely isolated um angry
(3:35:10) you know I would prescribe you get away from it if you know I don't know I I just know the statistics and the
(3:35:15) peer-reviewed studies say that red pill uh you know content um creators kind of
(3:35:22) create that in their audience and um that's what every study kind of says so and I think this loneliness epidemic is
(3:35:27) only going to lead to more men unalivives and that's what I don't want because I know what it's like to feel depressed i know what it's like to feel
(3:35:33) like you don't want to keep going and so I want to help people um find a way out of that
(3:35:39) do you think uh do you think that feminism is sort of is similar to red
(3:35:45) pill or do you think they're different in in the there's a difference of advocacy of what they're talking about but you think it's like the counter
() 
(3:35:51) image no I think Missandry is probably the closest thing to what red pill is because I don't think there's
(3:35:57) necessarily an equivalent for women on that side but I do think that my personal definition of feminism and I
(3:36:03) think a lot of people's today is just equal opportunity regardless of outcome um so that's what I view as feminism
(3:36:09) equal opportunity would you be in favor of uh the draft military draft for women um I don't consider that equal
(3:36:15) opportunity what What do you mean um for example an opportunity would be um well
(3:36:21) yeah I I ag Well I don't think the draft is an opportunity for men or women agreed agreed so I'm not really talking
(3:36:27) about equality of opportunity but it would be equality if both men and women were subject to but I'm not I'm not
(3:36:34) pushing for necessarily full equality i'm pushing for equal because that's not my definition my definition is equal
(3:36:40) opportunity if a man has the opportunity to do something and a woman is just as capable of doing said thing then do it
(3:36:47) now in in my definition if you're talking about conscription if a woman is as capable of a soldier as somebody else
(3:36:52) and the country decides that's what that's you know that's what we should go then go for it but I don't think we should just start drafting anybody i
(3:36:59) think it is about And also for the record do you know how many what percentage of men were drafted for Vietnam
(3:37:05) uh I think wasn't it like a couple hundred thousand no but what percentage of the male population at the time it's
(3:37:11) like 2% so it's not that big of a thing and in the 20th century only Hold on it's not that big i thought your whole
(3:37:17) thing here though was like I want to reduce the unaliviving rate of men i want to reduce let's get rid of
(3:37:22) conscription right but you're saying it's not that big of a thing i think the Vietnam
(3:37:28) veterans who were drafted who either are still alive who have PTSD or depression or who are homeless whatever it is or
(3:37:35) the ones who are dead probably disagree with you that it's a small thing no you're right that I shouldn't have said it like that i'm saying it's a small
(3:37:41) percentage of the population that it's not happening to the vast majority of men so I think the vast majority of men
(3:37:47) aren't ever going to be drafted it's never going to be a thing simply because in the 20th century only 9% of the total male population has been drafted so
(3:37:54) that's still more than I'd like wait in the in in the 20th century only 9% of
(3:37:59) the male population has ever been drafted in US that's a lot of men i agree but it's not the majority and it's
(3:38:04) not the vast majority it's not even close well all men have to register for the selected service agreed so there's
(3:38:12) inequalities while I agree with you that there might we might be in peace time or there might be periods of peace time
(3:38:18) where there's men aren't going to be drafted there are still ramifications for not
(3:38:24) registering for the selective service sure and all men have to register for the selective service one of the big
(3:38:29) things we were talking about was voting in order to be eligible to vote as a man you have to register for the selective
(3:38:34) service failure to do so precludes you from the ability to vote sure i don't necessarily see that as an opportunity i
(3:38:40) see that as something I wish I'm just talking about equality in general not but I'm not I'm not really prescribing equality across the board i I'm saying
(3:38:47) equal opportunity so if a man is able to make a decision in his own life to do something and a woman is just as capable
(3:38:54) of doing the same thing she should do it too i'll engage with you on equality of opportunity women have the opportunity
(3:39:00) to not be subject to the to selective service and force military conscription
(3:39:05) seems like an opportunity right but so are you in favor of just abolishing the draft entirely ideally yes okay but do
(3:39:12) you think that that's uh politically tenable i think so i think we have a large enough volunteer army and I also
(3:39:18) think uh wars in the future aren't going to be necessarily boots on the ground i
(3:39:23) think wars in in the future are going to be either cyber or they're going to be drones or they're going to be we have air superiority i don't think it's going
(3:39:30) to be boots on the ground unless something crazy happens i mean let's talk about the most the two most modern conflicts so you have the war in the
(3:39:37) Middle East and then you have the Ukraine war are there not boots on the ground are men not being drafted into
(3:39:43) these conflicts sure but they're not being drafted there wasn't a draft in in Iraq there wasn't a draft in Afghanistan
(3:39:48) these Well I'm talking about Ukraine and and I'm talking about the United States oh you're talking about the United States yes okay yeah yeah there hasn't
(3:39:54) been a draft since Vietnam right but in Ukraine there there is forced military conscription and they abduct men into
(3:40:00) the in the streets i don't agree to that i mean maybe if it's like things are so dire that's what we have to do i mean I
(3:40:05) I hope we never get to that point but in an ideal world we have a large enough in the US we have a large enough volunteer
(3:40:11) army and we have technological um advancements that are are superior to our adversaries so um I don't think it's
(3:40:18) going to be a boots on the ground war unless something crazy happens to the world yeah but so given so I mean we can
(3:40:25) talk about should the draft go away but since it is a reality the draft is a reality or selective service is a
(3:40:31) reality should shouldn't women be obligated to uh sign up as well i don't think so no why um I think because men
(3:40:40) are more capable in war that's why and I think that's what you'd rather have yeah but I mean for So I I saw a stat and I
(3:40:48) maybe somebody in the military in the chat can weigh in in order to field one combat soldier you need 10 uh support
(3:40:56) roles in the military yeah so if you want like frontline combat soldier you need 10 people uh in support roles
(3:41:04) administration to enable that uh one individual on the front line so there are roles that women could serve in the
(3:41:10) even look even if women were subject to force military conscription it's probably unlikely that they would
(3:41:16) encounter uh frontline combat i personally think that's still unequal i
(3:41:21) guess I would accept that they should at least be subject to force military conscription but there's plenty of roles in the military that women can you know
(3:41:29) the the pencil pushers pencil pushers well here's what I'll say i think men should still be the primary people that
(3:41:35) have to serve i mean again I I if I could get rid of you know the draft I would if we have just a volunteer army
(3:41:41) and technological advancements to to combat our enemies but should a draft if something terrible happens and we have
(3:41:47) to draft I still think primarily let's draft men because they're more capable at combat and in the front lines but if
(3:41:53) we desperately need the help and women can be in the support role then you know maybe that's a discussion to have
(3:42:00) honestly I think we should just draft women for frontline combat i don't think
(3:42:05) that's a good idea that That's kind of sexist of you i don't think I'm I don't
(3:42:11) think I'm preventing this no you don't believe in strong independent boss babes i do and if there are women in my in my
(3:42:19) definition of feminism if there are women who would like to go to the front lines because they feel capable enough then go for it but I'm not saying they
(3:42:25) should be forced to i think I honestly we draft them it's kind of like you know we've had hundreds hundreds thousands of
(3:42:31) years of forced military conscription for men maybe just like test it out for like a century
(3:42:36) just send the women to war you're not serious though right and we should teleise it this isn't for you're not for
(3:42:42) real right this isn't for real i mean look if this this idea that men are
(3:42:47) better suited for for war yeah you're you're right but what if everybody just
(3:42:52) we all agreed and let's just let the women do a bit of the fighting for a century
(3:42:58) it's just women versus women so it's kind of you know Oh I see what you're saying it's not women across the board
(3:43:04) like I think equal for the equality of opportunity we should allow women to have post-traumatic stress disorder and
(3:43:11) you know just like get a get a artillery shell in the in the the gullet i'm in
(3:43:18) favor what would the men be doing we would be uh what what are the women doing in Ukraine we'd be on Tinder
(3:43:25) sleeping with the the women who didn't get drafted we would uh we would be
(3:43:30) kicking it we'd be kicking it we'd be uh mowing lawns and [ __ ] and
(3:43:37) I mean that is an interesting hypothetical but um you're not for it you know i'm not I'm not because again
(3:43:43) my loose definition of masculinity is doing the right thing because it's the right thing and I think men Yeah what's
(3:43:49) the right thing the right thing in this situation is protect women that's what I feel like protect women yes i I think
(3:43:54) the right thing would be in the event of a war all the countries just agree all countries agree okay we're just going to
(3:44:00) have women you know we're all feminists now we're going to have the women fight just test it out and then but we get to
(3:44:07) televise it too i mean we already do that with the war i I just don't think that's necessarily feminism i mean
(3:44:12) here's a loose example the women get to fight no it's an equal opportunity it's not It's an
(3:44:18) equal opportunity to die that's not an opportunity that No one thinks being the front line is an opportunity opportunity
(3:44:23) for women to die no I certainly don't that is misogynistic sir i want you to
(3:44:29) apologize to all the women watching that you don't want equal opportunity for women to die so the way I see it and
(3:44:36) this is a stupid example but it's the first one I that came to mind if you're on an airplane and you see someone struggling to put their their suitcase
(3:44:43) up do you get up and do it if if I see somebody struggling on in the carry-on
(3:44:50) what what I don't I'm just asking when you're on an airplane do you and you see someone struggling i'm not even I'm not
(3:44:57) even saying anybody i'm not even saying a gender i'm not saying anything if someone is struggling sure I'll help that's kind of how I feel masculinity is
(3:45:04) i'm capable enough to do this thing i should do it that's how I feel i think we should help
(3:45:10) women get drafted into the military and let them do a bit of the dying i don't believe you i think they should I think
(3:45:16) the women should do a bit of Trump hands are these your Trump hands okay i think
(3:45:22) we should have some of the women do a bit of the dying just to equal it out a little bit you know a little bit of
(3:45:27) shell shock little you know a little bit of uh mortars let them experience some
(3:45:34) mortars trench warfare trench warfare is back in Ukraine they got trenches you see the drones dropping the the grenades
(3:45:41) you seen that yeah let's maybe look equal uh let's get women to do it i I I don't I don't agree i don't agree deb
(3:45:49) I'm the real I'm the actual real feminist here you you seem like a bit of a red pill podcast bro with your you
(3:45:56) know men are supposed to men are supposed to protect women
(3:46:02) that's very you know that's I think I think men should protect the innocent and I think men should protect people
(3:46:07) that can't protect themselves that's what I believe when So the women are the innocent and the men are what the devils
(3:46:13) no if what are the men i'm not saying men are I'm not giving a judgment on men i'm not giving a judgment on anybody
(3:46:19) necessarily but if somebody can't defend themselves I think men should that's all men men should yeah no but that's why
(3:46:25) I'm saying with the war we just make that [ __ ] all women we have a United Nations we have them agree okay for the
(3:46:31) next hundred years all the men you know they're not going to fight we're going to send the women to fight
(3:46:38) i think that you're not on board with that do you get on board with that do you think that would be You're not on
(3:46:43) board with that i'm not do you think that would be good for the general population and in terms of us you know
(3:46:49) continuing our population do you think that would be a good thing yeah it'd be good okay it'd be good okay yeah you
(3:46:56) know you send you send the feminists to fight send the feminists to fight or send the anti-natalist cuz like look if
(3:47:03) if you're a woman and you're pregnant you can you can get out of it but don't you want women to be getting pregnant
(3:47:08) during this time look we're going to put a cap only 10% only 10% of the women can
(3:47:14) fight that's it we won't send more just 10% that's it that's a weird rule when
(3:47:20) you're having a war where you're like "Hey we're only going to send 10% of our troops you guys agree to that?" I don't I just don't think that works i mean
(3:47:25) again I don't think anyone would well 10% of the population in this hypothetical 10% of the population so uh
(3:47:32) just why but don't you think we should send women I don't war why not i don't I just don't because I don't think they
(3:47:37) think they're capable i I think men are more capable in war men are more capable in war okay all right we got some chats coming

(3:50:03) I'm not going to tell you to change but if you're not I'm prescribing you consider alternatives that's all I'm saying you know this is what I think is
(3:50:11) going to happen you do that second debate with Andrew i think you might become red pill." It's not going to
(3:50:17) happen i think it could happen i love my life too much i just don't know why I would switch my life is great i live in
(3:50:23) Orange County your life would be even better it can't be it might be better i live in Orange County i have two great

(3:50:59) that conversation early but how are you going to build more blue pill that you said your
(3:51:05) blue pill right how are you going to have more blue you got to because if if you know the Christians are are out you
(3:51:12) know having more kids well here's what I'll say to that i don't think necessarily the dogs can't be blue pill
(3:51:18) dogs are red pill honestly my dogs are red pill dude my dogs are My dogs are Trumpers it's really What breed what
(3:51:23) breed uh I got a lab mix and a lab red pill dude they're super mad

(3:51:30) what's the other one uh he's like a a hound mix a hound oh that's very red pill red pill they're very red pill they
(3:51:35) knew they told me when I came here I was going to lose it to Andrew yeah dude it's really [ __ ] up you speak to dogs i speak to dogs that's part of the blue
(3:51:41) pill but um one of the things that uh I'll say oh wait you had something serious a second ago oh about having
(3:51:47) kids i I don't necessarily think and I think a lot of parents would agree that just because you have a kid doesn't mean
(3:51:53) the kid is going to follow your worldview a lot of kids are born into religious families and then they end up being atheists so I think you can't say
(3:52:00) I'm going to make more people cuz they're going to follow my ideology i want to take care of the people that exist today and have them consider a
(3:52:07) different ideology that's why you gota you can't let them have a smartphone
(3:52:12) until they're 18 hey look i think that Hey I didn't have a smartphone till I was 18 and I stopped being Catholic so
(3:52:18) yeah that's not cuz smartones weren't around you know at the time but uh and I
(3:52:23) got to say look I I got a flip phone when I was in high school nice and uh so you were rich i Oh yeah
(3:52:31) just piles of money with my little shitty Samsung or whatever it was i'm just kidding man um but uh you know I I
(3:52:38) kind of feel bad for the kids today like at 10 years old you got you got access i
(3:52:43) agree great well you know what though i had the internet i had the internet but the internet back then wasn't what it is
(3:52:49) today in the 2000s the internet there was some crazy [ __ ] yeah i mean the thing is even like to get a little more
(3:52:55) serious but like the people that are finding Red Pill it's because the YouTube algorithm is often recommending it to people it just kind of like
(3:53:01) happens they just like go on YouTube and all of a sudden now they're redpilled yeah you know the thing is though is
(3:53:07) like feminism is mainstreamed that [ __ ] is forced down your [ __ ] throat and
(3:53:12) I'll tell you this i'll tell you this Raphael let me tell you about the feminism okay here's the thing about the
(3:53:18) feminism you got the university you got colleges every single university college in this country let me tell you every
(3:53:25) single one has a woman's studies a feminist studies a gender a gender
(3:53:30) studies program i'm telling you it's indoctrination the feminism mind virus

(3:53:42) a bachelor's of arts of advertising did you take a feminism class in college you took feminism did you tell us the truth

(3:53:54) of Florida which is very [ __ ] red no that's base and I don't remember having any how did you turn out like this well
(3:54:00) I thought for myself as as your as your guy from [ __ ] Florida and you became
(3:54:05) a feminist what the [ __ ] and it was a It wasn't Florida right now it was Florida 20 [ __ ] years ago exactly yeah and
(3:54:12) I'm telling you like the guy said I just learned a thing for myself am I being cringe or is it kind of funny i think it's kind of funny it's kind of funny
(3:54:18) all right all right we got more chats coming through more chats all right none thank you very much nonated $69 thank
(3:54:24) you depressed and angry people search out RP who can be bitter and hateful ellie long-term RP is amazing for men it
(3:54:31) pushes to get a great vetted partner go to the gym get a job and get a social life hey Anan if that's what you're
(3:54:39) getting out of it that's great i mean I think going to the gym is great taking care of your body is great i think having a great social life is great i
(3:54:45) think picking a good partner is great josh Brooks donated 69 coming in here thank you so don't think it's a good
(3:54:51) idea for women to be in combat but are okay with them going if they want what would it look like to you if it was
(3:54:57) 50/50 women to men boots on ground describe that plaza what would it look
(3:55:03) like i mean it would look like 50/50 i don't know i don't know what it would look like i mean ideally men would
(3:55:08) probably be more in the combat roles um because I again I think they're more capable in that scenario um but if some
(3:55:16) terrible thing happens and women have to go too well then I hope they're supportive that's that's kind of how I see it
(3:55:22) i You know what so okay when it comes to duties though so men we were talking
(3:55:28) about the draft earlier yeah and this you would agree is a duty that men have that women don't which part a
(3:55:34) conscription yeah conscription uh at at most 10% of men have that duty
(3:55:41) yes well all men are uh are subject to the potentiality That's correct of the
(3:55:49) draft that's correct i agree with you not all men will be drafted most men won't be drafted ever uh but they do
(3:55:56) still have to register for the selective service if they don't there's certain uh there it's technically a felony there's
(3:56:02) a fine you can't uh reg you can't get certain federal student student loans there's certain federal jobs that you're
(3:56:08) barred from if you fail to register and uh I think there's maybe one or two
(3:56:14) other things that are evading me right now but um I'm just I'm curious
(3:56:20) though what like what duty do women have
(3:56:25) to to either men or to society i I just don't necessarily prescribe duty if I'm
(3:56:32) legally obligated a duty that's different than what I think is just an inherent duty something that you're just
(3:56:37) coming to this world without anyone asking if you want to be here and being prescribed duties out the off the gate i
(3:56:43) don't necessarily think I I don't believe that if there are duties do you not believe that i don't believe that
(3:56:49) you inherently have duties just because you're born
() 
(3:56:54) but I mean so every single male in the United States once they turn 18 have to
(3:56:59) register for the selective service and an entailment of that is in the event of some wartime conflict where a draft
(3:57:06) where there is a draft someone could be forced to go and die go
(3:57:12) and die or serve in the military that's a duty what that's that's a exclusively
(3:57:18) male duty what duties do women have but it's through the legal system if the legal system changed that then it wouldn't be a duty anymore so yeah sure
(3:57:25) i agree so if we didn't have that anymore it would no longer be a duty and I don't necessarily think men have a
(3:57:30) duty outside of anything legal if my personal worldview is that men should
(3:57:36) help whoever they can because they're capable of it whoever is the most capable should help that's what I feel
(3:57:41) no like do men have a duty to protect women no if a guy decides he doesn't want men don't have a duty to protect I
(3:57:46) don't necessarily think everyone has that duty i think men I think men who subscribe to my version of masculinity
(3:57:53) they would feel that need but not everybody would do you think men should protect women in my in an ideal world
(3:57:58) yes but I'm not going to say you must you know like I don't I don't believe I don't believe in must um so I think it's
(3:58:04) the same thing with women cuz I know a lot of people say "Well if men have to do this thing then women's duty should
(3:58:10) be birth because that's what they do." And I just don't think we should see women that way personally i have a
(3:58:16) question for you um when it when it does come to the draft and I know it sounds like you would like to abolish the draft
(3:58:22) is that fair ideally yeah okay but given that governments and nations will not relinquish the ability uh or the right
(3:58:30) to force its citizenry uh into a military conflict if the government has
(3:58:35) deemed it necessary to do so uh again what would women's duty or what should
(3:58:42) women's duties be under the current system i I don't have one i don't I don't have any kind of prescription for
(3:58:48) that would you say this for example so uh one of the arguments for why women aren't subject to military conscription
(3:58:54) is in the example of some catastrophic war you ought to protect the women because they would be able to repopulate
(3:59:00) the the uh the the nation they could repopulate the nation cuz you know you
(3:59:05) could have one man impregnate 100 women doesn't work the other way yeah I've heard that um but do you think for
(3:59:11) example like let let me ask you this granting that a specific government is
(3:59:17) not going to get rid of the draft uh you would agree that well I mean this might
(3:59:24) even be your own position let's say there's a a belligerent nation and this
(3:59:29) is hypothetical so let's talk about the United States let's say uh China decides
(3:59:34) to invade us and you know that the uh doctrine of the Chinese invading force
(3:59:40) or the government or whatever it is uh they're going to if they successfully invade the United States they're going
(3:59:47) to put all the men to the sword and they're going to take all the women as war brides and they're essentially going
(3:59:53) to essay all the women okay and the as the the US military currently
(3:59:59) stands in this hypothetical with just the volunteer force the volunteer force would not be capable of the military
(4:00:06) intelligence they do have the military force would not be able to repel or defeat the invading Chinese army
(4:00:13) military however you know with certainty if you were to draft men that you would
(4:00:19) be able to repel the invading Chinese military force would you under this circumstance force men to fight if let's
(4:00:27) say you were the dictator of the United States
(4:00:32) i think I would under my worldview because if I think the right thing to do is to try to protect the innocent even
(4:00:39) though innocent men are also involved in this um I think it's still the right thing to
(4:00:45) do and it sucks but I think that's kind of what I think right and I think perhaps the calculation here is you know
(4:00:51) that by forcing these men to go and fight you are sending men to go and die
(4:00:56) and men will go and die right innocent men but if you don't they're going to die anyways and all the women are going
(4:01:02) to get raped by the invading Chinese right my question to you now is this though is that in a similar scenario
(4:01:10) let's say We projected we knew with certainty I don't know it's again hypothetical in 20 years time we knew
(4:01:18) that the Chinese were going to invade in 20 years but we knew our our population wasn't large enough to fend off this
(4:01:25) invading force and the only solution to this would be to have a draft for women
(4:01:31) to give birth to children immediately so that we would have the necessary and
(4:01:36) requisite population in 20 years time to fend off this coming invasion would you
(4:01:42) instill a uh birth draft and to be clear the women could pick their partners and
(4:01:47) have consensual sex but the government would essentially say "You must do this you must have children otherwise all the
(4:01:54) men are going to be put to the sword and you guys will all get great." I would not force it if that was if women wanted
(4:02:01) and couples and husbands and wives wanted to volunteer for that fine but I would not make it a mandatory thing um
(4:02:08) but if you didn't make it a mandatory thing the enough people that would want to do it the entailment of it would be
(4:02:14) if not a women not enough women gave birth there wouldn't be a substantial enough uh fighting age population in 20
(4:02:20) years time and so in this instance uh even if you're forcing or if you don't
(4:02:26) force the women to give birth then all the men get put to the sword and all the women get taken as war brides um I don't
(4:02:34) know i I I have I have trouble with that i It just doesn't sit right it's very handmade still tail to me and that just
(4:02:40) seems completely dystopian um so hypothetical yeah i I don't think I I
(4:02:46) don't think that's something I would do if I was the leader of the country i would either try to find another way um
(4:02:52) but or try to encourage people to do it on their own without it being forced i think those were would be my first two
(4:02:58) options if push came to shove and it was they're going to die anyway then maybe there's something but it's just I would
(4:03:05) try to other options first do do you think uh giving birth is a is a uh when
(4:03:11) you otherwise wouldn't want to is like a bigger grievance than men dying um not
(4:03:17) necessarily a bigger grievance but it is an undertaking that takes quite some
(4:03:22) time and it's beyond just pregnancy it's also raising the children and feeding the children and doing all that so it's
(4:03:28) a longer engagement and men aren't guaranteed to die in the war some will
(4:03:33) so I think if you're guaranteeing women to be forced to have pregnancies I think that's different than the potential to
(4:03:39) die sure we got some chats coming through we have give me one sec guys jason Cassell uh-oh jason Castle donated
(4:03:48) $69 you really are an idiot over 8% of men were drafted during Vietnam around
(4:03:55) 33% of men were drafted in the 20th century in the USA it's not true you are
(4:04:00) a fing idiot it's not true i'd like to see your numbers what Jason's saying is not true or Yeah
(4:04:06) it's Yeah his numbers are too high i don't know i don't know if he he You know what he's looking at i think he's
(4:04:11) looking at eligible 33% yeah yeah 8% and 33% he's looking at eligible men for the
(4:04:18) draft instead of just the total male population yeah but I mean like men who are in their 60s wouldn't be drafted
(4:04:24) theoretically we're all going to get to our 60s so Jason Cassell can you clarify are you talking cuz like the drafting
(4:04:30) age I think is between like 18 and 25 26 I think he's looking at eligible I'm
(4:04:35) talking about total male population people who have been drafted okay uh let's see here we have uh Noodles thank
(4:04:42) you man appreciate it guys $69 $69 $69 TTS forward to the upcoming content
(4:04:49) brian Raphael why do you advocate for equal opportunity and not actual
(4:04:54) equality i think RP is encouraged from this keep telling men life is tough
(4:05:00) though um I don't know if I'm saying men life is tough i don't remember if I said that
(4:05:06) but um I don't necess my version of feminism is not forcing outcomes it's
(4:05:12) forcing uh or it's basically giving opportunity so equality would be forcing
(4:05:17) outcomes and I don't believe that's what it is i think everyone if they're capable should have the opportunity to
(4:05:23) do something that is my version of it i don't think forcing equality is what I'm
(4:05:28) advocating for all right guys $69 TTS we have a few more coming in we have Lucas again thank
(4:05:36) you Lucas appreciate it lucas donated $69 my man and I use that term loosely
(4:05:43) just defined feminism in a nutshell opportunity/s without reciprocal
(4:05:49) duties/obligations thought men are more capable therefore they should be happy to die i mean if the only prescription
(4:05:55) is that women's duties is that they should have children I mean I think that's lazy i just think that's like
(4:06:00) well they should have kids like no I don't I don't believe that wait you should you don't think women should have
(4:06:06) kids as a duty oh as a duty okay uh although shouldn't it I perhaps it's not
(4:06:14) a duty for all women but like would you say maybe the majority of women should have children i wouldn't I again I
(4:06:20) wouldn't say should I think the people who are deciding to have children today often are people who have made the
(4:06:26) calculated economic decision to do so and they are in a better position to be parent good parents in my opinion so I
(4:06:32) think we're not necessarily looking for numbers and volume i think we're looking for good parents and good families i
(4:06:38) think that's the ideal not volume we have Najib thank you for this donated
(4:06:47) $69 how do you define male privilege women being oppressed sexism or feminism
(4:06:53) if you don't believe in I have definitions for sex or gender i would say male privilege is mostly because we
(4:07:00) have men have mostly been the people in power so they um are less likely to have
(4:07:06) ever been oppressed i mean I know men go through oppression um as well but if you look at it from a perspective of women
(4:07:13) they have been far more oppressed than men have they yes I would make that case how so because I believe oppression is
(4:07:20) the systematic denial of rights and resources so for example women couldn't
(4:07:25) go to college women couldn't vote women couldn't own land women couldn't have bank accounts that's more oppressive to
(4:07:30) me because it's systematic let's talk about voting for just a sec uh what is the period of time at least in the
(4:07:36) United States that uh almost all or all men had the right
() 
(4:07:41) to vote and women didn't uh I don't remember i don't know yeah I think it's uh if I I could be off by a couple years
(4:07:48) but I believe it's 50 years that's a period of time between when men all men
(4:07:54) or almost all men had the right to vote and all women had the right to vote before that most men most women they
(4:08:00) they couldn't vote right you had a you had small groups of concentrated power
(4:08:06) you had monarchies very small people voting is a really super new past couple
(4:08:13) hundred years you go back even 200 years most men couldn't vote most women couldn't vote the way that men uh got
(4:08:20) the right to vote is because they had to go to war yeah at a point in time yeah
(4:08:27) yeah right like if you you if you look at so women got the right to vote in 1920 right what happened just before
(4:08:34) then world War I world War I and so it's interesting conveniently for for women
(4:08:40) and I suppose feminists that they got the right to vote uh right after the mo at least at the
(4:08:48) time world War II had higher casualty count although you could argue that in many ways World War I was uh much more
(4:08:54) brutal in in in many ways the trench warfare and the soldiers were on the front for way longer than you know
(4:09:02) they'd be like in perpetuity on the front um whereas like in World War II
(4:09:07) they to they shift out and it was a bit different but it was World War II was also really of course um but the the
(4:09:15) most barbaric war that had ever been seen up until that point most casualties etc etc uh women conveniently secured
(4:09:22) the right to vote right after it because one of the concerns of the suffragettes was well if we secure the right to vote
(4:09:28) as women we're going to be subject to to military conscription feminists were
(4:09:33) able to secure the right to vote without any corresponding responsibility and that responsibility duty would be having
(4:09:40) to go to war sure and so I mean and and again men got that because they had to
(4:09:48) basically be willing to die they had to be at one point it wasn't that so some at one point it was also land ownership
(4:09:54) and things like that there there were other differences too but I mean this this idea though that that women that
(4:10:01) men for like millennia had like all men Mhm i I will actually grant to you that
(4:10:08) like throughout most of human history the men which by the way was a very very small percentage like 0001% of men had
(4:10:16) power the rest were like the peasant peasant the peasantry class oppression too you know right but so like the top
(4:10:22) apex of men yeah they're the ones who did have power yeah but like that doesn't speak to the
(4:10:28) 99.99% of men who were just as oppressed and who had Honestly I would argue
(4:10:34) throughout history at least my big argument here was is as it relates to warfare women have often been shielded
(4:10:41) by the barbarity of war absolutely women have been shielded from having to participate they're protected typically
(4:10:47) at least you know your own civilization your own population your own nation your own society women are are protected are
(4:10:55) protected and so I mean no I see what you're saying i I I'm not denying that men have been oppressed there's
(4:11:01) obviously been oppression of men as well i think though as time progressed men got more and more privileges that women
(4:11:08) didn't same with minorities you know there was oppression with minorities as well you know slaves had to appeal to
(4:11:14) white men in order to get free you know there's been oppression of different classes races and and and things like
(4:11:19) that and I and men obviously have been oppressed too um but I think as time has
(4:11:25) progressed men had more and more agency and women didn't and I think even if
(4:11:31) you're talking about voting let's let's take voting off the table just being women being able to own land or women being able to have a certain job those
(4:11:38) were you know taken from them and that's why I define it as oppression now voting I think anyone should have the right to
(4:11:44) vote because it's their country they have a right to say i think if you're a disabled man that doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to vote because you
(4:11:49) can't go to war so I I I think you know uh in terms of denying resources and
(4:11:55) rights women minorities have had it worse than let's say white men uh in
(4:12:00) general uh I mean it's perhaps on that specific front you said denial of
(4:12:05) resources and and rights systematic denial of resources and rights a
(4:12:11) systematic denial of resources and rights okay so and the examples you provided
(4:12:18) were what like land ownership land ownership uh certain jobs going to school
(4:12:24) tell me what year do you think women were allowed to own property and land uh
(4:12:29) they weren't allowed to have you know debt and and bank accounts and things like that for a long time so they
(4:12:35) weren't owning land until I mean as far as I'm aware they weren't owning land for quite some time uh women have always
(4:12:41) been able to own land okay maybe that's a bad example my my understanding of it is that when women were married any
(4:12:48) property that she had became her essentially her husband's that's my
(4:12:53) understanding of it oh interesting and if the marital couple they owned land it
(4:12:59) was like in his name women in the 1800s in the United States 1900s they could
(4:13:05) own land maybe that's a bad example maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong about that but for example uh a father in his will
(4:13:12) could bequeath to say he only had daughters if if if it was actually true that women
(4:13:19) could not own property or own land in the event that a father uh a father of
(4:13:25) only daughters and he has say three three or even one remaining heir uh one
(4:13:32) daughter two daughters three daughters where would the property go to probably
(4:13:37) the daughters so they could own property and they could own theoretically but but
(4:13:42) I'm saying if a woman wanted it's not just theoretically in practice women owned land they could buy land okay like
(4:13:50) I said this is pro this might be a bad example but that doesn't mean women could have their own resources to
(4:13:55) purchase land maybe they inherited it or maybe it came through something else but women didn't weren't able to work in
(4:14:01) highpaying jobs for a lot highpaying jobs in this country for quite some time like I said they couldn't practice
(4:14:07) medicine or finance or uh law 55 years ago that's when someone 55 Hold on it's
(4:14:14) in the 1970s hold on you're saying there were no female lawyers prior to the 1970s that's correct i'm going to have
(4:14:20) to I need to fact check this uh when you're ser just to be clear there were no no female lawyers women could not
(4:14:28) practice law until around the 1970s when could women
(4:14:34) practice law and this was hold on so I'm and if you can
(4:14:42) correct me if I'm wrong so the first formal admission of a woman to the bar
(4:14:47) was in 1869 with Arabella Mansfield's admission in Iowa by
() 
(4:14:54) 1879 federal law allowed qualified women to practice in any federal court and
(4:15:00) Belva Lockwood became the first woman admitted to the bar of the sup Supreme Court you're like a century off 1870
(4:15:09) 1869 i'm telling you in large I'm telling you in large practice women couldn't practice law or men until 1970s
(4:15:15) that's correct where's the evidence for this i I looked it up this claim is completely dubious i looked it up dude
(4:15:21) so you're saying by law they were procluded excuse me same way women were
(4:15:27) procluded from going to school same way women could go to school to college yes okay i believe there are perhaps some
(4:15:33) private schools that uh didn't allow them in i think that's I'm I'm not denying that there weren't specific
(4:15:39) schools that barred women from entry but my understanding is in the starting in
(4:15:45) the 1800s women had access to higher education let's say I'm wrong about all those things could women let's say could
(4:15:52) women have their own bank account could women have their own bank account uh you tell me i don't They couldn't that was
(4:15:59) factually true it's factually i mean look I want to look at what you're looking at maybe my data was wrong i
(4:16:04) doubt it but I I definitely would be curious but um do we have any more chats
(4:16:10) yeah there are some more chats uh hold on i just had one thing on the bank thing
(4:16:15) um my understanding here though um with this women couldn't have bank accounts
(4:16:22) and I'd like to research it because on look I honestly it's not a specific category of like historical feminism
(4:16:28) that I'm aware of what I've heard though is many banks they required married
(4:16:34) women to have a husband co-signing or a brother mostly but that was due to them
(4:16:39) being a unit it was due to them not being able to secure credit pretty sure
(4:16:46) yeah but I um um something about credit
(4:16:51) uh hold on something about banks anyways here let me get through the chats just cuz we got to try to get this wrapped up
(4:16:57) soon but we will get these chats read guys $69 TTS if you want to get it you know what maybe we got to do a little
(4:17:03) more roast session hold on we got Daniel here thank you Daniel appreciate it
(4:17:08) daniel_mace donated $69 it's funny you say you care about men's
(4:17:14) mental health then say let's go extinct in pursuit of women's jobs and autonomy
(4:17:20) doesn't sound like you care love logic though right i don't think women
(4:17:27) pursuing jobs means men's mental health has to be sacrificed in that process i
(4:17:32) said an extreme thing that I think if people don't have autonomy I don't see a point in in living so that's I mean if
(4:17:39) I'm not going to live you know in a in an oppressed way if I don't have to so I I don't know that's how I feel i think
(4:17:45) didn't you say earlier that uh when it came to like free will and agency you
(4:17:51) wouldn't sacrifice that to uh save the human species correct question for you
(4:17:58) what if you had to force one woman oh Jesus hold on it's not going to be bad
(4:18:03) she couldn't have a career you had to force her you're like "No lady." One lady one lady you can't have a career
(4:18:11) and you and if you you you put a a restriction on her free will but it
(4:18:19) saves the entire human species do you do it i'd be open to it but she open to it
(4:18:24) i'd be open to it you Well hold on you'd be open to it i'd be open to it so I have to sleep on it i have to You got to

(4:19:03) okay so but you Oh I you know would you would you do it i'd have to have a long conversation with her you Why would you
(4:19:09) got to Cuz I'm I'm restricting this woman's agency i'd have to see you have 10 seconds to make the choice it's like
(4:19:15) the the uh trolley dilemma so okay i hate the trolley dilemma yeah so save
(4:19:21) all of humanity save all of humanity or uh but if you don't I would choose

() 
(4:19:34) appreciate it brother lol boots on the ground is not a support role see you just reverted back to saying they should
(4:19:40) just be in support roles what is your stance i'm confused i I don't know i
(4:19:47) don't think I changed my stance my stance is if I believe men should be the ones doing most of the combat if women
(4:19:53) want to volunteer in support roles they can but if we're talking about a forced draft of women which I don't advocate
(4:19:59) for if we do a force draft of women I don't advocate for them being combat roles i
(4:20:04) advocate for them being in support roles that's my position front straight to the front line they don't even get training
(4:20:10) you just here's a gun just send them lucas donated $69
(4:20:16) thank you Lucas one/me steelman your position men have duties/obligations bc they should just
(4:20:23) do the right thing but women shouldn't have any duties to society whatsoever in
(4:20:28) other words a definition of feminism i mean I I think when people are talking
(4:20:35) about women's duties what are they actually talking about besides going to war which I think most of us agree that
(4:20:40) that's not what we're trying to do the only other option that I hear as like a duty for women is forcing them to have
(4:20:47) or they should have a duty to have children i don't believe in that so unless you can come up with another duty
(4:20:52) that you think women should do I'm open to it but that's the only one I hear all right guys reminder $69 TTS if you want
() 
(4:21:00) to get a roast in guys want to get a roast in lucas Lucas donated $69 is a
(4:21:06) female supremacy movement double salute wow a woman has got you joyful trained

(4:21:33) off there as you were I didn't understand his question honestly um no I don't think feminism is a female
(4:21:38) supremacy yeah he said "In other words your definition of of feminism is a female supremacy movement." I don't see
(4:21:45) it as supremacy in any way it's equal opportunity that's not supremacy we have some super chats we're going to
(4:21:51) read if you want $69 TTS the state of things yet another example of a feminist coming in and saying their observations

(4:23:29) fallen nation michael G thank you so much man for that super chat a fair dilemma i don't believe we should force

(4:23:55) me get that all set up here super quick uh Raphael what do you think about
(4:24:01) um what do you think about uh you know just abolishing feminist studies
(4:24:08) program programs in universities do you think that would be good i don't are you
(4:24:13) on board not necessarily i I I mean I personally believe if people want to study whatever they want in college they
(4:24:19) can um I don't Yeah I mean I don't think it's going to lead to a you know hiring
(4:24:24) career but if people want to learn about the subject I think that's okay oh okay
(4:24:30) yeah there you there you go um but you know maybe we should just abolish it what do you think no just get rid of Oh
(4:24:37) my god I screwed this up already hold on i can't type guys 29.90 there it is oh
(4:24:43) [ __ ] dang it guys get a roast in so I can uh so I can take a break real quick
(4:24:49) uh all right we have Josh Brooks here with another message thank you Josh
(4:24:54) Brooks appreciate Josh Brooks donated $69 thank you okay but that's my point
(4:24:59) on your stance you say you would be fine if they wanted to be on the front lines
(4:25:04) but now you say they should be in support roles don't be wishy-washy pick
(4:25:10) one lane do you want to pick a lane um what I'm saying is that if women
(4:25:18) volunteer to be on the front lines go for it but if we're conscripting women I
(4:25:24) don't think we should force them to be on the front lines conscripting women
(4:25:29) shouldn't force them i you know look I would I think they should make it a uh
(4:25:35) like maybe HBO could host a pay-per-view for the war between women you know women
(4:25:42) versus women and it's it's televised for pay-per-view h yeah it would we would
(4:25:49) raise a lot of the GDP would go up it would be just on that it would I'm surprised the United States government
(4:25:54) hasn't done like peak capitalism like Okay we're going to do war pay-per-view
(4:26:00) i mean that [ __ ] would be insane we'll be out of debt in no time that would be crazy son okay uh let's see what do we
(4:26:07) have what do we got we got some We got some super chats guys it's been lowered $30 TTS get a roast in if you want
(4:26:13) christopher if the goal is equal opportunity and women have the opportunity to opt out of motherhood via abortion why shouldn't men have the
(4:26:20) opportunity to opt out of fatherhood via surrendering paternal rights not paying child support okay so here's my my
(4:26:27) position on this i think if the the woman and the and the man agree that he
(4:26:34) can you know forego his pronal rights and and you know payment the child
(4:26:39) support payments which by the way I want everybody to know their only average child support payment is $440 so let's
(4:26:45) just pump the brakes here um but if the man wants to for and the women agrees totally cool with that um but it's not
(4:26:52) equal opportunity because men do not have the opportunity to be pregnant so it's not equal opportunity and it can't
(4:26:58) be unfortunately in that situation but you said wait hold on you said if
(4:27:05) the woman agrees so what if the man cuz like what if the man's like "Eh it was a
(4:27:11) one night stand i wasn't intending to be a father we were just hooking up."
(4:27:17) She's like "I'm going to keep the kid." I would agree is her right to do right i agree it's her right and I think if a
(4:27:24) man I mean if you guys are also you know against promiscuity I mean men should
(4:27:29) know the risk of potentially impregnating somebody and I believe that a man should take care of a kid if he
(4:27:35) has one now if they agree that hey I don't need you to be in his life or her life it's totally fine let's sign a
(4:27:41) contract you don't need to make child support payments hey that's between them but I think if a man just opts out on
(4:27:48) his own I don't agree with that but you're you are uh pro-choice right i am
(4:27:54) um and just curious uh do you have a cut off for I mean kind
() 
(4:28:01) of okay so it's tough um but something I've been mulling about I haven't given
(4:28:06) it that much thought but for example if a if someone has a miscarriage a death certificate is not issued right
(4:28:16) um I'm not sure i believe a death I believe a death certificate for a
(4:28:21) miscarriage is not issued till about 20 weeks if a miscarriage happens after 20
(4:28:27) weeks I think in the state of California you that death certificate is issued well what's your cut off for abortion
(4:28:32) probably 20 weeks okay so you favor of like third trimester abortion and but the vast majority aren't done that late
(4:28:38) sure um I guess though when it comes to the men having the right to escape uh
(4:28:45) child support for a child that they didn't want uh like what would you if there was a man sitting across from you
(4:28:50) sitting right there Andrew he was like
(4:28:56) "Raphael look man i'm I'm 21 years old i
(4:29:02) I've been hooking up with this girl i thought she was on birth control she got pregnant i'm not financially ready to
(4:29:08) have the kid i just don't want to be a father i'm not ready whatever it is what would you tell them i would tell them do
(4:29:15) you think the woman is also in that position because if she is you should help out what do you mean if she's also not
(4:29:21) financially ready to take care of a child yeah but what would you say to him in in the sense of the reasons he's
(4:29:28) given you for why he doesn't want I would say yeah that sucks but if she's
(4:29:34) going to have the child and she's also not financially capable or ready in her life to do it but she doesn't believe in
(4:29:40) abortion and she wants to have the child then he should take care of it and so
(4:29:45) now I want to switch it okay you have a woman sitting there and she says the exact same thing she says "Look you know
(4:29:53) uh my birth control failed i don't want to have a kid i'm not financially ready
(4:29:58) i don't want to be a mother i'm not ready to raise a kid uh what would you say to her if it's
(4:30:05) before 20 weeks and my to be consistent I would say I don't think you should have the child because I don't think I
(4:30:11) don't agree my goal is children raise in great homes and if you are not ready to
(4:30:16) raise a child and that child could have a bad life just I don't believe in just breeding for the sake of breeding so if
(4:30:22) that child is not going to have a good life due to the circumstances I don't think it's I I I think she should be able to get uh termination of pregnancy
(4:30:30) and the guy who you were giving advice to uh would you maybe have you might say
(4:30:36) to him for example you should have thought of that before you had sex for sure i I would say that's a bad that's a
(4:30:42) bad on her to like Yeah there consequences for having sex and would you say that to the woman probably yeah
(4:30:48) okay but she can always escape escape her situation through an abortion sure
(4:30:53) because she's the one that has to go through the pregnancy right but don't you think for the sake of equality men
(4:30:59) should be granted in instances and cases and states where women do have abortion
(4:31:04) rights men should have a corresponding right uh it's often called by men's rights activists as legal paternal
(4:31:11) surrender the more uh the other term is paper abortion they typically don't like that term but but legal paternal
(4:31:17) surrender essentially as a man you could say "Hey uh I didn't want to have the kid i don't want to be financially
(4:31:23) responsible for 18 years i don't want I I relinquish any paternal rights uh
(4:31:29) parental rights that I have but I don't want to be financially responsible for the kid it seems to me if you're saying
(4:31:34) to the woman well you have this exit of and you didn't like this the way Andrew
(4:31:41) categorized this uh he considers it murder right you don't like that categorization if the woman can murder
(4:31:47) the child the unborn child uh what would actually be wrong with then men wanting
(4:31:54) to just not have to be financially uh tied to the child once it's born well
(4:32:00) I want to clarify that I'm not necessarily saying equality i'm saying equal opportunity and men do not have
(4:32:06) the opportunity to be pregnant so I think women have that that's the sole thing they have the opportunity to do so
(4:32:11) if they make the decision to keep the child that is a risk men take if they impregnate somebody and I think again
(4:32:17) from my worldview of masculinity doing the right thing would be taking care of that child so um if uh you know what's
(4:32:25) abortion then what do you mean well um just one point of clarification you when
(4:32:30) you say you're against third trimester abortion do you say like for your own
(4:32:36) like in terms of your own view but like let's say a woman she wanted a third trimester abortion would you like by law
(4:32:43) do you think those should be precluded um I don't know i that's tough it's
(4:32:50) tough i don't I wouldn't support it myself like hey if I if I if I somebody was pregnant they were 20 weeks past I
(4:32:57) wouldn't say you should get an abortion but you would be open let's say there are there's a cohort of women out there
(4:33:03) who if they were pregnant and if they were in the third trimester and if they
(4:33:09) wanted to get an abortion you would not have any guard
(4:33:14) rails or laws or anything like that preventing them from getting the abortion say at 9 months i would need to
(4:33:21) understand I think the medical aspect of that a bit more because I know most abortions that take place early are done
(4:33:26) through pills and there's very it's it's quite simple of a process if it's that
(4:33:31) late I think it enters kind of a territory I'm uncomfortable with so I I'd have to I'd have to understand that
(4:33:36) a bit more yeah no you're you are right like when it's really early on in the the pregnancy they can take a pill which
(4:33:43) are the vast majority of abortions yeah and uh but I I my understanding is once it gets a little further on in the
(4:33:49) pregnancy the I don't know the exact procedure i I think they uh there there
(4:33:56) can still be pills or something that they take but they still then they have to remove the fetus and there's like
(4:34:02) maybe I heard again I'm not an expert this is not an expert field for me but uh they vacuum it out or something i've
(4:34:09) heard that too i have no idea i I don't know it could be fear mongering but again I know that the vast majority
(4:34:15) aren't done that way sure um but yeah in this hypothetical you know it is tough i
(4:34:20) I definitely think if you're at 20 weeks and you haven't made a decision or you change your mind I mean that's a bad
(4:34:25) that's a bad place to be it shouldn't be that way all right we got we're going to let the chats come through we got Noodle Zoodle noodle Zoodle donated $30 thank
(4:34:32) you man appreciate it i need an explanation as how equal opportunity is not a fancy way of saying female
(4:34:38) privilege giving benefits without the consequences or responsibilities is the
(4:34:43) problem but I also said that I don't believe men have inherent duties beyond
(4:34:48) my own view of what masculinity is i don't believe men I don't believe you're born into this world and you're
(4:34:54) automatically given a duty um so I I it's consistent in my view with women i
(4:35:00) don't consider that privilege at all if a man doesn't want to do the right thing and be a piece of garbage well their men
(4:35:06) do that every day they're able to do that without any sense of duty i feel the same way about women if they don't
(4:35:11) want to you know I don't think they're inherently given a duty at birth that they must adhere to beyond obviously
(4:35:18) obeying the laws which there's consequences for if you don't all right I'm going to just let these chats come
(4:35:23) through there's quite a few we got Nick nick donated $30 thank you appreciate it man brian you need to take a bio break
(4:35:30) i've seen better moderating on a leftist Tik Tok panel raphael you're a [ __ ] who
(4:35:36) prescribes the same DGEN behavior as Destiny but with dumber arguments i
(4:35:41) don't think I promote degeneracy i mean I personally don't have a problem with like high body counts but that doesn't
(4:35:46) mean I'm saying you should if you don't if you have a preference for not a high body count you're within your right to
(4:35:52) do that absolutely say this is not what I'm looking for everyone has preferences you should pick people based on your
(4:35:57) preferences wait I think during the show Andrew might have asked you this but uh I know
(4:36:03) you're married but if you were single or when you were single would you like let's say you knew like the girl told
(4:36:09) you or some [ __ ] she has a body count of He said like a thousand he said I think
(4:36:14) he said like five five Yeah figure 10,000 sure would you would you hit um
(4:36:21) as long as I got a STD test back and I cared about the person yeah 10 10,000
(4:36:26) bodies if there's no STD or risk to me then why not what about what about let's
(4:36:32) Okay cuz you could maybe say okay the body count yeah she has she's [ __ ] 10,000 dudes but it was like 5 years ago
(4:36:38) yeah and she's been celibate for a minute yeah right but how about this you're on a date with a girl mhm and she
(4:36:45) just [ __ ] 10 dudes last night without a rubber
(4:36:51) i probably wouldn't feel comfortable with that let's say she's clean she's clean i don't know it's If she's clean then I don't futuristic STD test that
(4:36:58) like okay knows right away if she's got some if I'm single she's clean and we like each other i I I What if though i'm
(4:37:06) still going to bust i mean whatever huh what the [ __ ] i said it press one of the buttons what the Here what the [ __ ]
(4:37:13) there it is wait so she just [ __ ]
(4:37:18) what about like an hour before you guys I mean this is I'm not in like a Bonnie Blue situation like I'm not going to be
(4:37:24) one of the guys lined up at the door but I'm saying yes i'm saying if the night before she did her thing you know I'm
(4:37:31) not in love with the idea but I'm saying if I'm vibing with somebody I'm single and like we're vibing and we're going to
(4:37:36) have a good time I I wouldn't turn it down i just wouldn't be like "Oh man I can't do I'm not going to do this." Do you
(4:37:45) um She There's literally the dude's
(4:37:50) Don't say it ejaculated oh come on inside are you gonna have sex with her
(4:37:56) bro probably with a condom but yeah wait huh huh huh
(4:38:02) bro you gonna have sex with a woman who has another dude's sperm inside her i'm
(4:38:08) vibing with somebody that is not going to it'd be enough to stop me no dude i don't care let me tell you this bro i
(4:38:14) don't care how hot she is i don't care how much how great the vibe is she could be the most based submissive housewife
(4:38:22) bowing you have an issue with the bow by the way i I don't know why you hate the bow so much you know what Raphael
(4:38:30) you think is your You think your wife is watching uh I think she is she's probably waiting to pick me up at some point you know
(4:38:37) maybe do the bow see if she just try it see if you like it if she just have her hit a bow and I You know what you might
(4:38:44) be a convert i might convert you dude i might convert you um I don't I don't
(4:38:50) know i think I I just when it comes to submission it's just one of those things that this is like a relic of the past
(4:38:56) and I think now we're living in a world where women are making you know young women are are advancing faster than
(4:39:02) young men right now like young women are buying homes more they're making more money now true so it's like the idea of
(4:39:08) like well I only want a submissive wife it's like I think you're missing out on some great relationship potential
(4:39:15) maybe not maybe not i just think I have met some awesome boss babes have you ever had I just use How dare you you
(4:39:23) misogynist i [ __ ] up have you ever had a woman do everything you say
(4:39:31) i maybe at one point maybe when I was younger yeah in Florida in Florida yeah
(4:39:37) probably but just to be clear I a clarification if you're really vibing with a girl if she's leaking a jacket
(4:39:44) hold on you said inside not leaking that's a different story i mean we're talking about 24 hours we're talking
(4:39:49) about 24 hours we're talking about 24 hours sometimes a girl is going to be Look she's got
(4:39:56) [ __ ] another dude's splooge it If the condom is on it's on that's all I'm
(4:40:03) saying if there was actively another man's semen in a woman's vagina but you
(4:40:10) had and it was the best condom ever it even covered your balls this Sorry
(4:40:15) that's getting [ __ ] den dude you would smash if If it was that kind of If
(4:40:21) I was that kind of night yeah if it was that kind of night that's
(4:40:26) [ __ ] disgusting what do you mean that kind of night you're liquored up you got some tequila or what if it's that kind
(4:40:32) of night you can't let the party let's get going look you're a married man and you It's not an open right you guys are
(4:40:37) monogamous right okay so this is a hypothetical you know i'm just saying if you ever find yourself single again you
(4:40:44) can't be [ __ ] girls who have another man's seat in them you can't do that Raphael you can't do that that's That's
(4:40:49) weird i don't know man if two people are going to have a good time I I can look past it that's all i can look past it i
(4:40:56) want cobwebs in that [ __ ] dude i can't deal with a girl if she's [ __ ] a guy why though why Brian why yeah bro
(4:41:04) there's got I can't The thought it's It's just gross it's just inherently
(4:41:09) gross you can't you can't be having sex with a woman and she's got another dude's seat in her i'm sorry Raphael
(4:41:16) it I'm not saying it's my preference but I'm saying I wouldn't say no if the vibe is right what question for you what if
(4:41:23) she's like I don't want you to wear rubber absolutely not and she's on birth
(4:41:28) control absolutely not and she has uh her tube style absolutely not when I was When I was single when I was single I
(4:41:34) always wore a condom period she can't get pregnant it's not about pregnancy and she No STDs either but the the man's
(4:41:40) seed is No even in the sugar when I was single I still I had work on it every
(4:41:46) time so no but she can't get pregnant she's got a [ __ ] hysterctomy she's got a hysterctomy
(4:41:51) no STDs her pussy's immune to STDs it just doesn't matter i pretty much only go raw with like long-term partners
(4:41:58) that's pretty much how I do it but no but why work no STDs no STDs she can't get pregnant it just What's the point
(4:42:05) it's just I don't know about you if Here let me let me I mean this woman's
(4:42:10) obviously hot enough that I'm considering this so I think the comm is going to be just fine she's very hot the comm is going to be fine but she's she's
(4:42:16) already has another man's seat in her but it'll be mission accomplished either way so it'll be fine i can't do that i
(4:42:21) can't but you know the crazy thing you're like I' I'd wear rubber uh me personally if a girl was like Brian I'm
(4:42:29) not ready to have sex yet but I'll give you a hand job i'd be like I'm okay i I
(4:42:37) don't even want like have you ever had like if a if that's all that's on the table like have you you've turned down
(4:42:44) hand jobs right have you turned down nothing's coming to mind you've never turned down a hand job like she's like I
(4:42:50) guess I could give you a hand job i'm like let's just not do anything nothing's coming to mind there might be
(4:42:55) a time but I don't nothing's jumping out at me so wait just to be clear though if
(4:43:02) she has the seed of multiple men inside her possibly an animal let's include an
(4:43:07) animal oh come on man now we're talking animals like we're talking beastiality
(4:43:12) animals are freaky bro no they're not beastiality some of these bro you should see these these fantasies these women with the dogs dude bro who you bringing
(4:43:19) on the show Brian we've had multiple women say they've made sweet passionate love to animals there was a horse girl

(4:43:40) wearing a condom or redwood it might be a redwood if I'm wearing a condom and no one's going to get hurt yeah if I'm
(4:43:45) attracted to them you're still going to bust so just to be clear one more time
(4:43:51) busting is busted if if a woman just had
(4:43:57) sex and he was Andrew Tate and his This is getting kind of like a little
(4:44:04) sus this is getting really sus i don't know and his seed was in her and you
(4:44:10) were but she's really hot and you guys are vibing are you going to have sex with a woman who has another man's seed
(4:44:16) in her if it's Andrew Tates does that make you
(4:44:21) want to do it more i'm Do you want to do it more a little bit i got to one up
(4:44:27) Andrew Tate i'll show that girl how I really put it down yeah I'll [ __ ] i'll
(4:44:32) convert her to the blue pill but okay removing the Andrew Tate thing you would have sex with a woman
(4:44:37) 24 hours after i can't do that bro i understand i I understand i'm not there
(4:44:42) i understand she could but that's your preference which is great she could be like I'm an average looking guy i'm not
(4:44:48) the best looking guy right she could be leagues beyond she could be so [ __ ] hot like it would be it would like if I
(4:44:55) got her pregnant right it would be a blessing to my future children right cuz she gets you know my children get the good looks whatever she could be so the
(4:45:03) hottest woman to ever lived [ __ ] smoking great personality

(4:45:56) previous guy said your world view is too in the middle doesn't solve the problem
(4:46:01) of good versus evil my guy thank you appreciate it i mean yeah I think but I think beyond you know I I think what
(4:46:07) some people consider good and evil are different i mean Brian and I just had a whole conversation about it i think people have different ideas of what's
(4:46:14) good and what's bad so it's hard for me to say "Hey this is absolutely 100% good." I don't necessarily believe that
(4:46:21) i have my my worldview and um I respect others mostly what What do you think about pegging if you like it go for it

(4:46:48) would you be okay and allow your wife to flower and other men that she wanted to
(4:46:53) i don't consider myself a victim at all um I I don't know where you're getting
(4:46:58) that from but I I feel like my life's pretty damn good brood for donated $30
(4:47:05) andrew couldn't even shake this guy's hand at before he left what a beta damn he called Andrew a beta that's [ __ ] up
(4:47:12) wait is he calling you a beta or I think he's calling He's probably calling me a beta well it seems like directed at
(4:47:17) Andrew maybe i don't know well honestly if if we wrapped the show does he normally shake hands i don't know but if
(4:47:23) we wrapped the show and you guys you know we you guys were leaving at the same time he'd I think he'd shake your
(4:47:29) but you were over here he was over there no I Yeah I didn't take it personal andrew Andrew's like even even the kind
(4:47:36) of heated nature of this conversation like after the show he'll be like it was good talking to you cuz I debated him on
(4:47:42) the show it was the same thing it was heated it was back and forth and it was like man it was fun honestly it was one of the more more heated debates he's had
(4:47:49) i thought it was good i thought it was good i didn't know I I just I'm just used to zero $30 raphael your main
(4:47:57) problem is that you equate duties/obligations with being oppressed also you would force men to die to save
(4:48:04) the nation but you won't force women to have children to do the same to save the nation i I don't equate uh duties with
(4:48:11) oppression oppression is systematic denial of rights and resources duties are automatic obligations that you just
(4:48:17) have for existing and so I don't agree with that all right thank you brood josh Brooks donated $30 thank you Josh
(4:48:24) appreciate bring back the gladiator arenas only blue hair and naval piercings against sleeve tattoos and
(4:48:30) septum piercings also whoever has the most abortions under her belt gets to
(4:48:36) handle the tiger cage free all right thank you for that uh Josh
(4:48:42) really appreciate it we have Noel here thank you man appreciate it noel Ramos donated $30 about population collapse
(4:48:51) there's no solution that keeps women's rights without marginalizing a population of men some suggest
(4:48:57) rethinking family structures why should men sign up for this future i don't know
(4:49:03) how men will continue to be marginalized because women have more
(4:49:09) rights i'm not sure how that works um family structures I do think we need to
(4:49:15) reconsider because I think a lot of what red excuse me what red pill and other ideologies say is like it should be man
(4:49:22) is the provider man is auh protector woman is the child uh you know bearer uh
(4:49:29) you know is is at home i think we live in a world where that's different now i think we live in a world where women are
(4:49:34) out earning some men so it's like maybe we rethink about it i think you know I don't judge stay-at-home dads the way a
(4:49:40) lot of like red pillars would i think hey if that works with a family and I've talked to a lot of women who say "My
(4:49:45) husband is a stay at home dad and I love him more than anything." That works for them so I I just I think we could
(4:49:51) rethink family structures grahams donated $30 thoughts on
(4:49:58) Republicans part of 2025 trying to ban unicorn it's about corn corn adult content yeah
(4:50:07) um I get the argument for it but all in all if everyone is a party you know to
(4:50:14) say this is what I choose to do then I I I don't want to remove that agency personally all right we got
(4:50:25) su zero donated $30 what is this guy's opinion on the Alina laws being voted on
(4:50:31) in Mexico right now it basically makes it legal for women to kill any man simply if they feel threatened or
(4:50:38) intimidated by him i haven't looked into that but that seems pretty wild i mean
(4:50:44) if if a man is essaying somebody or assaulting somebody I mean you got to do what you got to do but just feeling
(4:50:51) general threatened I'd have to look into it but that seems a bit overkill
(4:50:56) all right we have Silent DJ here for a video silent donated $30
(4:51:03) check your ex for a video roast this cut got nuked by Andrew i don't see any I
(4:51:09) don't see any DMs man but uh I'm not sure if we'll be able to pull it up unfortunately but uh we got Lucas here
(4:51:16) big donated $69 big Lucas thank you bro I just threw up in my mouth just
(4:51:22) venturing a guess here but am I correct in assuming that there's a worn out chair strategically situated in the
(4:51:29) corner of your bedroom uh no you are absolutely incorrect i believe he's referring to a cuck chair yeah I
(4:51:37) understand as they call it yeah I know that's a very common thing that people say i don't know what about me makes you
(4:51:42) think I'm not masculine i mean I I don't get it just because I have some different beliefs I'm not masculine i don't know man let's have a push-up
(4:51:49) contest would that would that would that prove something you know what Lucas lucas you're a friend of the show fly
(4:51:54) out to the fly out for the round two you and Raphael will do a push-up contest so
(4:52:02) if that proves what is masculine to some of these guys then let's do it wait question if Lucas wins though
(4:52:08) what What are we wagering here i think we're wagering I think we're wagering whether or not I'm a beta cuck i will
(4:52:15) admit I'm a beta cuck if he beats me in a in a in a push-up contest what if
(4:52:21) uh h I was going to wager the whatever channel but that sounds like a really
(4:52:27) bad thing i can't run this thing i can't run this thing to to wager uh all right
(4:52:32) thank you uh Lucas appreciate it man jason Castle donated $30 okay it took so
(4:52:38) long to get back to on the percent of men in war/20th century question i decided to
(4:52:44) do the calculations myself and fem boy is correct hey Jason I apologize for calling you a dummy on that question
(4:52:51) jason it takes a it takes a lot of courage and I think it's very masculine to admit you were wrong it's funny that
(4:52:56) you said I'm a fanboy but you apologize for calling me a dummy that That's progress man that's really cool now if
(4:53:03) he gets something else wrong he has to apologize for the fem yeah and then he'll come up with another name and uh
(4:53:10) Yeah all right Jason Cassell appreciate it man thank you thank you appreciate it he also wants to do a push-up
(4:53:15) competition with you by the way this is all the guys I wanted to put on so NZ donated $30 you don't seem like a bad
(4:53:22) guy and your arguments after Andrew left have been decent however at the start refusing to define anything and getting
(4:53:28) angry was poor form and made you look clueless i agree but I think even when I
(4:53:35) was messaging you I said "I'm not a debater." Like and Andrew is a debater to the core me and Brian are having a
(4:53:41) good conversation he has different ideas i have different ideas we're getting more done now than when Andrew since
(4:53:47) when Andrew left so that's why it gets frustrating he's a good debater he can trap me in things and I'm not as good at
(4:53:53) him as and I'll admit that so yeah you know the we are getting a lot done we
(4:53:59) were talking about a a jackallet ejaculate that's one that was good that
(4:54:04) was a good one jason Castle donated $30 progress guys i was doing only men that
(4:54:09) fought in wars my bad that would make sense i still think you are a degenerate and you lost the debate i'll still fight
(4:54:16) you i'm not even going to you know if I lost the debate I lost the debate i came here with a specific mission that's fine
(4:54:22) but if you want to spar man let's do it like let's meet here we'll spar all right Jason you know hey Jason you can't
(4:54:29) back down from a a fight i would you know a friendly spar i I think though I
(4:54:35) should start offering like a whatever boxing event
(4:54:42) dude that's it you know boxing event where But just for like equality do you
(4:54:49) would it be okay with you if like the men box the women no because I think doing the right thing
(4:54:54) is not hurting someone that equal equal rights equal less equal opportunity you
(4:55:00) keep strongmaning my feminism position that is not my position on feminism and I my position on masculinity is doing
(4:55:06) the right thing which includes protecting the innocent can I hurt do you know Gorlock
(4:55:12) so that's a transgender woman can I box her oh I thought it was the one that Rachel was arguing she No she mad Marge

(4:55:51) josh Brooks donated $30 you don't want women to be on the front line if it's
(4:55:56) conscription because of force you're okay if they choose you concede women
(4:56:02) should be in support roles women being hurt equals bad so no choice
(4:56:08) i just think I don't know if something's getting lost in translation but I think if it comes to conscription I don't want
(4:56:13) to force women on the front lines but if they choose to be on the front lines go for it but if we are conscripting women
(4:56:19) I would prefer they be in support roles unless they want to be on the front line intel Wild donated
(4:56:25) [Music] $29.99 this guy is a piece of [ __ ] he
(4:56:30) might as well start sucking off dudes and color his hair blue already only thing good about him is that he's from

(4:57:10) oh brother you want to engage in a bit of playground [ __ ] talk not to be self
(4:57:15) arandizing but I'm 6'4 in 235 lb and
(4:57:21) still bench over 300 lb of my old age let's get Lucas challenge accepted let's
(4:57:27) do it even if he's not here Lucas just come by the studio uh 64200 damn bro
(4:57:32) giga Chad dude yeah for sure no I'm not going to talk [ __ ] to you Lucas we're We're bros homie wow that was Me and
(4:57:40) Lucas are bros no we're bros well you know the thing is though is that it was a push-up contest right right so it's
(4:57:45) like you know like the thing is is that Well at least with pull-ups this is a bit different like a a guy who's really
(4:57:52) light he can do more like more pull-ups than a guy who's like big and shredded
(4:57:58) but Exactly there's a little bit of a like equilibrium there but push-ups are a little different they're different i
(4:58:04) can't bench as much as that but I'd be down to do a push-up contest all right Lucas push-up contest get it get out
(4:58:09) here to California you got your I don't want to spar Lucas c Lucas can you be on
(4:58:15) camera if you with your job but uh he's a lawyer uh Michael G now that you're friends with Brian look him in the eyes
(4:58:21) and call him a misogynist that's causing men to f11 themselves so unlive yeah
(4:58:27) well here's what I'll say look me deep in my eyes you got blue eyes too i didn't know that i didn't know that till just now um [ __ ] i mean [ __ ] i just I
() 
(4:58:35) walked into that um so I don't know that I can call you directly a misogynist no I can't do that
(4:58:42) but I do think What about all this what about all this Raphael it's not only you what is this a lot of your panel does it
(4:58:49) a lot of the people on your side do it it's not just you i think you're actually a pretty cool dude so but the
(4:58:55) thing is I think the show sometimes does promote that stuff and I think the guys who are angry find it to be "Oh my god
(4:59:03) women do suck yeah I agree with with this the show women do are the worst i hate them they have no logic they're
(4:59:09) stupid." And I just think the guys who are already deep red pill that's what they're going to continue to believe so
(4:59:14) that's the only thing I'm trying to do dude I do your show i you know do your thing i'm just saying I I hope that
(4:59:20) there are men out there that aren't like going deeper into it because studies show they do that's all I'm trying to I
(4:59:27) I don't want guys to unal alive themselves i It's just the thing and I'm not saying you're the cause of it but
(4:59:32) I'm saying because they're probably watching other content too it's not just this but all of that reinforces it in my
(4:59:38) opinion you know I think people who watch my show they actually love women more they
(4:59:45) love women more because they you know you got to go into
(4:59:51) something with your expectations managed and the blue pill thing is is you're
(4:59:57) going to have a sense of what your experience is going to be with dating but if you go in to dating
(5:00:06) knowing full well what that's going to entail then you're not going to be surprised when certain things happen and
(5:00:13) which will enable you to have an understanding of women and have a have
(5:00:20) your expectations managed and if your expectations are managed and you don't
(5:00:25) believe in this Disney fairy tale [ __ ] when it comes to dating and I think women have a lot of this isn't
(5:00:32) just men's view of women i think women need to lose the Disney [ __ ] too
(5:00:37) when it comes to to men also uh yeah I think they have I think some have lofty expectations of what women have of
(5:00:44) dating yeah but I think both men and women have been sold this like disnified
(5:00:49) uh sort of ideal which is just not realistic whatsoever and so for this reason I
(5:00:56) actually think if you're going into dating or your encounters with your girlfriend or whatever it is with with
(5:01:04) uh managed expectations you're not going to end up disappointed because you know exactly
(5:01:09) what you're getting into and I think that that makes for a much healthier relationship than having these uh
(5:01:16) unrealistic expectations whether you're a man or a woman when it comes to dating
(5:01:21) and relationships i think there's a fair point in what you're saying i think um you know let's dispel the fairy tale
(5:01:28) that there are people out there that have shitty ideals shitty preferences there's shitty people out there and not
(5:01:34) every woman's great not every man is great um I think that's okay to to say that but I feel like um it's
(5:01:42) constantly the expect okay so I'll tell you you know my TikTok blew up pretty quickly it's doing pretty good the
(5:01:49) comments I get from men constantly when I ask women would you date a man under 6 feet tall all the women said yes every
(5:01:55) single one I asked i know so what they say but the common thing I get from every red pill guy who's also single
(5:02:02) says "Watch what they do not what they say." But I'm interviewing married people and these people are married to
(5:02:07) people under six foot so I'm watching what they do and but men can't believe it because of what they're hearing in
(5:02:13) the red pill space they're hearing that women only want these preferences and that they're never going to get anybody and they're hearing that message over
(5:02:19) and over again well I mean to to your point a little bit so we asked the height question on our our show and even
(5:02:27) women on our show it's not like the these super brutal black pills where they're like "Oh I only want to date a
(5:02:32) 65 giga Chad." No the women say "I'm 5'7 i'll date a guy who's 5' i'm 5 foot i'll
(5:02:39) date a guy who's 5'4." You know they're like "As long as he's taller than me." And I I don't think that the women are
(5:02:44) lying necessarily but I I think you are to some degree misrepresenting the red
(5:02:50) pill position on this maybe which is I men they're not saying that it's perhaps
(5:02:55) a black pill position okay if you're not 6 foot you're just never going to get a girl i the red pill position is
(5:03:02) acknowledging the reality that women have a general preference towards tall men do you do you disagree that
(5:03:08) generally speaking women have a preference for taller men not to say that they wouldn't date a guy who's 5'
(5:03:14) but generally if they had like a choice between the guy who's 63 versus the guy who's 5'9 they probably But it's the
(5:03:22) same way guys would rather have Sydney Sweeney than you know some girl they just met on Tinder like men have the
(5:03:28) same kinds of preferences in terms of the extremes so I totally agree with you that but I think what happens is men get
(5:03:34) frustrated that women have those preferences and and it makes them feel like they're excluded and I don't think
(5:03:40) that's necessarily the case because men follow Instagram models and they think "Oh my gosh she's so hot this is who I'd rather date." But then they might meet
(5:03:46) somebody in the street and just because they don't look like that or feel that they don't feel like the attraction and so I'm saying you're saying the men
(5:03:52) don't feel attraction towards the women correct oh well I think that's men shouldn't follow prescriptively i would
(5:03:57) say men should follow like IG models yeah but you're right and I I think that's a dangerous precedent for men
(5:04:02) well like watch porn or anything yeah yeah of I and I can get behind that i think porn is setting men up for unrealistic expectations for the world
(5:04:09) and so they get upset because they feel rejected but they see women have these preferences for what they consider
(5:04:15) gigachads and it's like yeah if a woman had all the say in the world she'd probably want to be with that but the
(5:04:20) guy she ends up with is probably not going to be that and you're missing out I think on great opportunities to meet women and have a good relationship well
(5:04:27) I do want to address your your I guess comment or perhaps criticism of you said that you do these street interviews and
(5:04:34) the the answers that the women give you you're saying that they're counter to some of the narratives for example when
(5:04:40) it comes to height right and the the rebuttal that you probably receive is uh
(5:04:46) look at women look at what women do not what they say you probably get that all the time that's the comment I get but do
(5:04:51) you think that there's a component of truth there like I agree with you that women aren't aren't just like wholesale
(5:04:57) lying about every single thing they say however I also think that and this perhaps also applies to men too is that
(5:05:04) people want to give the answer that sounds good and I think that this men do
(5:05:10) this too but I think women do it a little bit more and so they want to give the politically correct answer the an
(5:05:17) answer that sounds good women don't want to uh give an answer that might paint
(5:05:23) them as potentially superficial or uh paint them in like a bad light so
(5:05:29) they're going to say "Oh I don't care about height." But for example what we've done on the show is you know you
(5:05:35) ask a woman "Well you don't care about height." But we just ask them Yeah I've seen it how tall of all your long-term
(5:05:43) relationships how tall have they been in a girl for example not all the time not all the time though to be fair like
(5:05:48) sometimes the girl yeah I dated a guy who's uh my my current boyfriend's 5'7 i dated a guy who's 5'9 but we've also had
(5:05:55) women who's who are like well I I'm 5'4 and I would date a guy who's 5'6
(5:06:01) and then they're like well my last three boyfriends were all 6'3 so it's like well that's a really small percentage of
(5:06:07) men uh in that in terms of uh the uh the
(5:06:12) what's the term uh percentile the height percentile like 6' 3 you're in like the
(5:06:18) 99th percentile um but again I think women will often say uh the politically
(5:06:25) correct feelgood answer to these things and I don't always think that they're
(5:06:30) honest about it and they did do a study on this i can't recall what but they asked women to compare I think it was
(5:06:36) six traits and I don't know if you've seen this there's this infographic floating around it was like uh what are
(5:06:43) the like the six most important things i think I've seen this and one of them was like good looks intelligence um money i
(5:06:51) can't remember the other ones and they uh I'm trying to remember when they
(5:06:57) looks was like at the bottom of their stated preferences but then I don't
(5:07:03) recall exactly what the study did but I think they showed them like images of men or something yeah yeah yeah oh I
(5:07:08) know the study yeah and then but uh their so there was a massive difference
(5:07:13) between their stated preference and their actual preference and their actual preference was more towards physical
(5:07:19) attraction as compared to what their uh stated preferences were and the other thing final I know you want to respond
(5:07:25) last thing on this is just if you ask women if they think lizo is beautiful they'll say yes right but do they really
(5:07:32) think that i know what you're saying i mean I don't know if you're a chubby chaser i don't want to put words in your mouth i'm just saying uh when it comes
(5:07:40) to physical attractiveness I think it's a tough sale to say that somebody who's like I'm not saying this
(5:07:45) to be insulting towards Lizo she's just factually morbidly obese or maybe she's
(5:07:50) been losing weight a little bit too i think most most people when it comes to appraisals of physical attractiveness
(5:07:56) are not going to say like somebody who's morbidly obese is physically attractive generally speaking most people wouldn't
(5:08:03) find that attractive i hear what you're saying and I got to lose a bit of weight guys i'm getting a little obese okay go
(5:08:09) ahead we got to cut out that in and out but um no I think uh I think you're on to a lot of things and I I I don't
(5:08:15) disagree that maybe some of these women are answering this way but that's why on my long form podcast I interview married
(5:08:20) women because I want to interview women who are actually you know putting their money where their mouth is a lot of the
(5:08:26) women I interview have either said "I have dated men under six foot." or one of my more popular videos is "Would you
(5:08:32) date a man who earns less money than you?" And all but one woman said yes and that woman was you know being
(5:08:38) honest which I appreciate um when I did the six-foot video the last woman I interviewed she was like "Well clearly."
(5:08:44) And she points to her husband who's like her height you know and it's just like this is great it's a it's a See so I do
(5:08:50) see that women are putting their money where their mouth is now in that study I if I remember correctly they listed
(5:08:57) their preferences but then they were shown photos and I think photos is always going to be a bit superficial
(5:09:02) like I think photo it's like kind of like Tinder and all that stuff it's very superficial i think what makes somebody attractive isn't necessarily just looks
(5:09:09) i think looks are the first thing you notice but I asked another question to women what's more attractive looks or confidence and every woman says
(5:09:15) confidence now do looks get you in the door sure but I think a confident man who's averagel looking has a shot if he
(5:09:22) has got a if he approaches a woman with confidence has some personality has a sense of humor he's got a shot i'm not
(5:09:28) saying more than the gigachad or whatever they call him but he's got a shot and a lot of women end up marrying
(5:09:33) those kinds of guys and I think the stats alone speak to it i think only 14% of the population is uh over 6' tall um
(5:09:41) or 6t and over but about 50% of households are married so obviously
(5:09:47) women are marrying guys who are under six feet tall yeah I would say most people uh probably a good amount of
(5:09:53) people in terms of getting married it's actually if we're talking about socioeconomics they're marrying people
(5:09:59) or in their socioeconomic class on the confidence thing though um I mean I
(5:10:05) don't think there's any dispute even in the uh the red pill space and there's some dispute of whether I even am red
(5:10:11) pill but um nobody denies that confidence is a bolster when it comes to
(5:10:17) attracting women i think the conversation though is that uh and this is I don't even think it's a red pill
(5:10:24) position really i think it might be like they're like yeah confidence is really important i think it's more Blackpill
(5:10:30) the Blackpill guys who are like "No it doesn't matter." Like uh it's all looks
(5:10:36) yeah heights looks face all that stuff i mean but they're not totally wrong like
(5:10:41) if you're really unattractive and you're the most confident guy ever
(5:10:47) not saying you're not going to get a girl but like the this idea that confidence is like the cure all for
(5:10:53) getting like it's some magic right uh wand for getting any woman i don't think
(5:10:59) that's the case i agree and and the other component though is that I think men who are confident uh are going to
(5:11:05) fare better in person so like an averagel looking guy but he's like got good personality and he's confident in
(5:11:12) person i think he's going to do well i think he's going to do well the issue is though is that uh the majority of people
(5:11:20) uh at least from what I've seen are meeting online so that confidence that personality doesn't really translate and
(5:11:27) so if people are meeting on Instagram dating apps etc uh and I my understanding from some statistics I've
(5:11:34) seen maybe it's wrong the majority of people are meeting online in some capacity they're meeting on dating apps
(5:11:40) so somebody's confidence or personality doesn't really have an opportunity to uh
(5:11:46) express itself online these women are swiping on the dating apps they're just looking for a hot dude they're going to
(5:11:52) see the hot guy first and look if he's like a little [ __ ] then yeah he's going to be in trouble but if he has like a
(5:11:59) mod of ability to have a conversation with a woman and he's good-looking and she's already physically attracted to
(5:12:05) him he's going to do okay where even if his confidence maybe isn't like exceptional yeah um I agree and I think
(5:12:12) that's kind of why I I want to encourage men i think that's why I do on the street interviews is because I'm approaching women randomly they have no
(5:12:18) idea why I'm approaching them i think most of the time they're like pretty they feel pretty comfortable with me but
(5:12:23) um I'm trying to encourage men to do that more because personal on the dating apps is a losing game you're outnumber
(5:12:30) you men outnumber women 3 to1 so they're already on a losing game like there are
(5:12:35) yeah the dating app I want men to get off the dating apps and I think they're kind of on the decline i know I think
(5:12:40) statistically recently more people I agree with them so I I'm encourage I want to encourage more people to go meet
(5:12:45) people in real life because that's when your personality can shine and that's when your confidence can shine that's when your sense of humor can shine and
(5:12:50) if you feel like I don't have enough money or I don't have enough this it's like honestly there are guys at McDonald's that are married there are
(5:12:56) guys at Walmart that are married there are guys at gas stations that are married and I'm not saying that's the norm but it's possible and I think
(5:13:02) people can find love and partnership and that's all I'm trying to push for that's really it um because I I'm not saying
(5:13:09) like I'm like a huge natalist but I think there's a common ground in what a lot of the red pill and and a lot of
(5:13:15) these other people think is that at the end of the day we do want to have a thriving population and how do you do that you get people together and right
(5:13:21) now there's too much of a divide so I'm trying to limit that divide as much as I can that's that's my mission that's what
(5:13:28) I'm trying to do and I you know it's I'm brand new to this um but any guy I can
(5:13:33) reach with that it's like I I know what it's like to not have confidence i know what it's like to feel like you're never
(5:13:38) going to date a girl um and it's sad and I don't I hate that feeling for men and I know a lot of men feel that way so um
(5:13:46) I just want them to not feel like if you don't have six figures six foot six-pack
(5:13:51) abs and no woman's ever going to like you cuz I just don't think that case because average men are and I go to
(5:13:57) Disneyland i go to all these places i look around i'm like look at all these people in relationship look at all these
(5:14:02) guys and girls they're just so normal looking people you don't see online i I don't think there's a dispute here
(5:14:08) necessarily uh there's a lot of average people who are dating other average
(5:14:14) people um but I think that there there are a couple issues here um and again I don't
(5:14:22) think anybody disputes this yes if you go out into the public you'll see like a looks matched couple you you'll
(5:14:29) see it all the time there is though a cohort of both men and
(5:14:35) women who with their own dating experiences are encountering certain things as it relates to it's not all
(5:14:43) women but there are quite a few women who have uh let's say delusional
(5:14:50) expectations as it relates to their dating prospects agreed agreed um and perhaps the same could be said I think
(5:14:57) for a smaller portion of men men seem to at least my assessment men seem to be more realistic as it relates to their
(5:15:04) dating prospects and the the you see you also mentioned you have an issue with like the looks rating thing but I'll
(5:15:10) I'll explain I think why so and this is what I explain to the women and I know you don't like the rating thing but I
(5:15:15) think it's important and and here's why is because women have uh sexual access
(5:15:22) to um men who are who I would argue are outside of their league whereas a man if
(5:15:28) you uh if you step to a woman who's outside of your league and I'm at the
(5:15:34) moment I'm just talking about looks i know what you mean but like men can bolster their prospects with status money confidence personality there's
(5:15:42) ways men can bolster and date out of their league by making up for it with those things I just mentioned yeah
(5:15:48) agreed but because women But the thing is though generally speaking I would say like the average guy for example uh most
(5:15:54) average men can't be [ __ ] right right i I think that most average men don't have
(5:16:00) access to hookup culture yeah I agree uh they can't go and like sleep with a new
(5:16:05) woman every single day of the week yeah every single woman even below average I'm not even talking about average women
(5:16:11) i'm talking about below average women if they were so inclined they could be [ __ ] yeah if they wanted to if they
(5:16:17) turn it on they could any woman can be a [ __ ] agree very few men can be [ __ ] and so what you have happening is
(5:16:24) essentially you have women who have sexual access limited sexual access cuz
(5:16:29) they're not getting commitment but they have limited sexual access to men outside their league so what happens
(5:16:34) there uh you you basically you have a lot of women who are chasing after men
(5:16:39) who um frankly would never commit to them right and this is a cycle that
(5:16:45) women could get into in their 20s as they're dating yeah and these men uh and
(5:16:50) look here's prescriptively uh I don't think men should sleep with women if they don't have a genuine bonafide
(5:16:57) intention of being in a relationship with that girl i don't think men should be promiscuous i don't think men should
(5:17:03) be promiscuous i think that's a healthy message but in a situation where we have completely uh uh we have a global sexual
(5:17:11) marketplace uh things are completely li liberated women can hop on a dating app and [ __ ] a really attractive guy and it
(5:17:18) can be done without like the prying eyes of their social circle and their peer group you have women who are going to
(5:17:24) hook up with these men you have men who are also going to hook up with these women for a different reason though yeah
(5:17:29) um and so because of this you have women who it the way I often describe it is
(5:17:36) this what have you ever been in a dorm room uh you ever lived in a dorm room i never lived but I I've experienced that
(5:17:43) you ever like had housemates or roommates uh yes but like in a like off-campus house but yeah okay and you
(5:17:49) shared a bathroom or something yeah uh you currently uh I assume you and your wife live alone uh yes just us and our
(5:17:56) dogs yeah yeah um it's really hard to go from uh from having like let's say you
(5:18:04) live in a mansion to going to live in a shared having roommates not housemates
(5:18:10) roommates people who live in the same room as you and you share a bathroom with three people similar to that if a
(5:18:17) woman has dealt with a certain caliber or tier of men it's going to be kind of like you're like "Okay this is my league
(5:18:24) because I can sleep with these men." But you're for women their league is the men that they can get into long-term
(5:18:30) committed relationships with so these men will entertain short-term sexual relation limited short-term sexual
(5:18:37) relationships with these women men don't have that same ability to secure like to
(5:18:42) secure that i so for this reason there's this differential that exists between men and women where essentially you do
(5:18:49) have a cohort of women who's like well I'm they're perpetually chasing men who
(5:18:55) are out of their league because it's like the breadcrumb of like I can get a
(5:19:00) guy who's more attractive we all want the best right as men we want to get the most attractive good personality woman
(5:19:08) whatever the whatever the you know whether we want to shoot for that yeah like we all want to get the best that we can get right uh and same with women
(5:19:15) women want to get the best mate that they can get but again going back to what I was saying men
(5:19:23) get insta rejected so men have to be like if I step to a girl who's a 10 out
(5:19:28) of 10 Victoria Secret model bro it ain't happening it ain't happening i don't care how confident podcast you're
(5:19:37) not happening uh if I step to a girl who's clearly out of my league I'm not
(5:19:42) she's not going to be like "Well for example if I'm offering her on a silver platter sex she's like "No but like as a
(5:19:51) woman if you offer a a guy who's more attractive than you on a silver platter you offer him sex right
(5:19:58) he's g he might take that opportunity." So women have at least limited sexual access to men outside their league and
(5:20:04) so essentially uh it creates a completely different a massive dynamic
(5:20:10) yeah no and I think I think you're you're absolutely right there's nothing everything you said was absolutely correct um I but I think what what
(5:20:16) happens here Yes i think online women and men have unrealistic expectations of
(5:20:21) what they can get and women have more access to those unrealistic expectations yeah they get breadcrumbs they get a
(5:20:28) taste of it yeah they get a taste they get a taste yeah they get a And it's hard to go back to the room i get what you're saying i totally understand i
(5:20:34) think there are certain people that chase that kind of thing though i think there are other women who you know maybe
(5:20:39) they're raised in a different environment they're not chronically online um they they really do want
(5:20:45) someone to just sit on the couch and watch Netflix with you know and they want to go get in and out and like do that kind of stuff so I but I I I
(5:20:51) totally agree that maybe there's some misguidedness on like our expectations uh because of the internet but I also
(5:20:57) think that part of the frustration that men feel is that imbalance in the sexual
(5:21:02) marketplace and so men are frustrated because women do have access to that and they don't and that frustrates them
(5:21:09) because they want access to those same women but they can't get them and so there's a frustration that comes from
(5:21:14) that that I think what happens is online that starts to build as they continue to you know consume content that basically
(5:21:21) tells them that's all you should be is this cuz if you're not that you're never going to get anybody and I think that
(5:21:26) message is pounded into men's heads so much so that when I'm talking to them I'm like "It's not like that i got to
(5:21:32) get you outside i got to get you offline and talking to real people." And I know it's difficult it's hard to approach a
(5:21:38) woman but I I was I was getting my haircut for this podcast and I was getting my haircut and I was telling
(5:21:43) them I was coming on here and one of the girls was like "Oh I'm single you know." And I was like "Well uh you know do guys
(5:21:50) ask you out?" She's like "No." She was like "And honestly the next guy that asked me out I'd probably say yes cuz he had the balls to do it." And I'm like
(5:21:56) "Wow." You know like "Shout out to homie and OC like hit up Camp uh haircut you
(5:22:01) might you might get a date." Wait you you have a female barber no no no she I have a male barber she was in there she
(5:22:07) was in there and I was talking to her uh she's one she worked there um so yeah okay that's my point i'm going to uh let

(5:23:52) nothing be a man and stop being a clown you won't see it in others only way
(5:23:57) you'll understand is when it happens to you you probably got no guy friendss either i do have guy friends that That
(5:24:04) hurts though that hurts man god Duran Dolls dude I haven't seen you in a while donated $30 thank you so much being
(5:24:11) handsome gets your foot in the door which leads to success which builds confidence just tell guys to be more
(5:24:18) confident bro i don't know why more men didn't think of that i I have something on this i I hear what you're saying i
(5:24:24) think looks help you helps you feel confident but I think confidence can be built in other ways for example just
(5:24:30) having a belief in yourself that maybe hey I don't have all the answers but I'm going to come do it anyway that's confidence or you build confidence by
(5:24:36) successfully doing things over time beyond dating just hey I tried to learn this how to ride a motorcycle and now I
(5:24:42) ride a motorcycle that builds confidence learning new skills that builds confidence i don't think it's just looks
(5:24:47) looks help but there's other ways to build confidence all right we got ghost here thank you Duran good to see you
(5:24:53) logistics donated $30 btw my kid I took custody of at 1.5 months old from a girl
(5:25:00) I broke up with for lying about birth control dated her for a week men
(5:25:06) abandoning is often avoiding the persecution in court ghost
(5:25:11) yeah I have heard reports like uh so for example a guy will uh really want to
(5:25:18) fight for his children and then he'll go talk to uh a family law attorney yeah
(5:25:26) and the family law attorney does not have like a good uh prediction for how
(5:25:32) it's going to go and that men face certain uh challenges when it comes to
(5:25:40) uh custody disputes and this sort of thing and so a lot of men just I mean
(5:25:47) they're like man I'm going to spend all this money with a really low chance of
(5:25:53) getting a positive outcome one of the other things that often frequently happens and I don't know if this is the case for Ghost I don't recall his points
(5:26:00) is and I'm not saying all women do this but this is actually and I think this is something that's been studied but uh the
(5:26:07) incidence of false accusations once a custody dispute has been initiated and if the man challenges
(5:26:15) the uh dispute over custody um it's it's frequently seen more so uh almost
(5:26:23) exclusively on the women's part for various accusations to manifest themsel
(5:26:28) out of the ether uh once the man starts uh fighting for custody for example uh
(5:26:34) there will be accusations of uh verbal abuse there'll be accusations of emotional abuse there'll be accusations
(5:26:41) of physical abuse towards the towards the woman but then if uh if the woman
(5:26:47) doesn't get her will there will be further accusations that are even more sinister and malevolent she'll start
(5:26:54) accusing the man of abusing the child physically abusing the child and I think the worst sexual uh well the yeah of the
(5:27:02) child and um these manifest as attempts at leveraging uh these sorts of
(5:27:10) accusations to either uh destroy the morale of men who are
(5:27:17) attempting to uh fight for custody of their children yeah uh or to paint a
(5:27:23) picture of the man as being uh essentially uh well abusive and
(5:27:30) precluding him from getting any degree of custody uh and I'm not look there are
(5:27:36) genuine instances of abuse but this is seen and uh Lucas is an attorney i don't
(5:27:42) know if you he can weigh in on this and I don't know if this is his area of practice with uh well I don't think it's his area of practice family law but this
(5:27:49) is seen frequently in custody dispute situations which tend to end up when there's a mutual uh custody dispute
(5:27:56) often times are very very uh what's the term for like with a legal thing if it's
(5:28:02) uh contentious very contentious very get very nasty and when people are fighting
(5:28:10) over their children which I think is really unfort fortunate uh often times in furtherance of if if it's expedient
(5:28:18) to throw out the false accusation in the hopes of either uh making the court
(5:28:24) believe that these abuses are real or demoralizing the the man the the man to
(5:28:31) uh cease their his his pursuit of custody uh it's it it's actually
(5:28:37) effective sadly i bet i bet i bet it I I I Okay assuming the instances are false
(5:28:43) of course i'm sure there instances where it's true but assuming this is being completely fabricated yeah that can
(5:28:48) totally be used against men because I'm sure there's a bias that that happened or they're going to believe the woman you know because of this you know and
(5:28:54) that's horrible that shouldn't be done um I I I abhore anybody who tries to
(5:29:00) keep a good father from their kids i think that's horrible i think that's one of the worst things you could possibly
(5:29:05) do keeping bad fathers away from kids i'm okay with keeping good fathers away that's that's evil in my opinion yeah
(5:29:13) yeah um and I don't know if that's a ghost situation but uh there was like I think two separate guys who sent in
(5:29:19) messages who were saying they had like these just catastrophic like months or
(5:29:24) even year-long custody disputes it's just it's you know what's actually interesting is uh I I actually sat in uh
(5:29:33) I was like preparing for a small claims case I was dealing with and I just went to the courthouse and I sat in uh and uh
(5:29:41) in one of the these court proceedings and I watched like three separate uh
(5:29:47) divorce slash uh child custody child support and it's it's really sadly dude
(5:29:53) it's like sad to see these two people they once loved each There's children involved and the
(5:29:59) relationship's just completely destroyed it's really sad it's sad as hell and uh yeah it's uh it's horrible for everybody
(5:30:06) you had criticisms as it relates to like my anti-marriage position and like
(5:30:11) honestly I this might seem like kind of doomer black pill but I do think it's
(5:30:17) worth it for men to just to just go make an informed decision just go and watch
(5:30:25) family law proceedings for an hour or two and just be you gotta be I'm not
(5:30:31) saying well maybe don't get married but at least go into it knowing that in the
(5:30:38) event of a divorce that's how it could be so one just you got to pick you got to make sure you pick the right woman
(5:30:45) absolutely you don't want to be dealing with a woman that's going to be like any sort of It's tough though even some
(5:30:51) women switch up so you can't even really know but you got to just make sure you got to vet you got to vet the woman

(5:34:54) compliment Michael i do try to be kind and good-hearted um I am thriving though i got to say I love I do love my life
(5:35:01) all right and then we have these final messages here from Lucas lucas donated $30 thank you man
(5:35:08) one/brian James Ston talks about this a lot women fight hard for custody bc
(5:35:15) there is child support dollar at play the child support money is typically not specifically earmarked for the kids so
(5:35:22) it can you know really quick I'm going to let the rest of viewers come through there there this is actually a men's rights position in the same way with
(5:35:28) like food stamps and SNAP benefits like food benefits uh you can only like they
(5:35:34) give you a card you can only spend it on food uh you can't like go buy like I don't
(5:35:41) know like alcohol you can't go and buy like um electronic like it it will only
(5:35:47) work with food and I think there could be something else implemented with child
(5:35:52) support where it has to be spent on something it could get a little
(5:35:58) complicated though if like part of it is like helping out with rent but like child support should go towards the
(5:36:04) child it should go towards child expense like child support related expenses it
(5:36:10) should you shouldn't be able to get your nails done if there's like excess money from the child support so I think I I I
(5:36:17) think everyone can agree with that are there people that don't are there people that think otherwise cuz I feel like that's pretty reasonable yeah well but
(5:36:24) there's not currently like like a system for that there's not a system in place for that it's just like here's $2,000 or
(5:36:30) here's however much money it is you can really spend it on anything you want so
(5:36:36) Lucas donated $30 countered so the mother can use the child support dollar
(5:36:41) for whatever since it's never audited also family law is court of equity so
(5:36:47) false allegations are typically handled as per the judge's discretion
(5:36:52) lucas donated $30 what's that three/ not pursuant to a law standard of proof also
(5:37:00) officer Tatum has often discussed the weaponization of false TV allegations yo
(5:37:05) Jay bench £400 you got me bro what what is
(5:37:11) uh court of equity what does that mean never heard that
(5:37:17) 04 donated $30 brian lost my ex-wife to substance abuse and bipolar disorder
(5:37:24) came out of the blue even if you think you picked the one it can change overnight it cost her the marriage and
(5:37:31) her life i'm sorry buddy that's That's hard man wait you lost her as in she it
(5:37:36) sounds like it it sounds like it cost her life you lost her like you got divorced i think you said it cost her
(5:37:42) life i don't know oh and she Okay oh my god I'm so toaster brain and her life
(5:37:47) okay that's hard man i didn't see that part sorry to hear that man um damn it takes a lot of bravery to to engage in
(5:37:54) relationships cuz they really can go bad i mean that's that that's the reality they can go real bad and I'm really
(5:38:00) sorry to hear it went that way that's Yeah i mean that's the tough thing too is like you think you know somebody but
(5:38:08) people change circumstances change i don't think most people go into
(5:38:14) relationships or specifically marriage like like anticipating that there's
(5:38:19) going to be a divorce like they're probably not like thinking like this is going to happen but they probably think
(5:38:25) this is the love of my life right and and it's devastating if it if it goes the other way it's devastating because
(5:38:30) you really do believe in this thing so yeah I I look I I don't want to belittle men trying to date because it is scary
(5:38:37) as [ __ ] and I think that's why women appreciate the courage often because it
(5:38:43) is a brave thing to do to go talk to women and I I mean I from my own experience uh I've actually dated some
(5:38:50) pretty wonderful women uh but there was one girl in particular I dated who she
(5:38:56) had uh borderline personality disorder BPD and uh I mean honestly there were
(5:39:02) some I was young looking back there's some signs pretty early on there were
(5:39:07) some signs early on that I probably could have tuned into but I was young and naive and didn't have much
(5:39:12) relationship experience but uh like uh definitely people you know like that
(5:39:19) relationship from how it started to like it changed a lot completely different it was very different but even like people
(5:39:25) who don't have any sort of uh like personality disorders or whatever [ __ ] can change absolutely and I think one of
(5:39:31) the things though at least as it relates to marriage which is one of the things men should potentially look out for is I
(5:39:38) think once you're married I think the woman has more has leverage because if
(5:39:43) if you're the bread winner if you're the bread winner as the guy and you're getting into alimony territory
(5:39:50) then it's like she's kind of got you by the balls it
(5:39:56) she's got you by the balls it can be but I I I could be wrong but I think again I
(5:40:01) might have been wrong about some of my stats but I believe only 10% of marriages end up with alimony payments i
(5:40:06) think I think it's something along those lines yeah I don't know what the statist statistics are on it obviously if you've
(5:40:12) been married for a short time my understanding is if it's below a certain threshold you'll pay alimony for a
(5:40:20) duration that's proportionate to the length of uh you know the marriage it's
(5:40:25) not like I don't think it's you've been married for 3 years you pay alimony for 3 years i think it's maybe I don't know
(5:40:30) it's different in different jur jurisdictions maybe it's half i think in California it's either after eight or 10
(5:40:36) years then there's the it's potentially life lifetime alimony that's kind of
(5:40:42) ridiculous but well I personally believe you know if you're really worried about if you really have a lot of assets and
(5:40:48) finances and you're worried about alimony I mean if you know I think a woman can understand a prenup prenup i don't think there's anything wrong with
(5:40:54) that yeah that there's concerns with prenups too they can be Yeah prenups can be challenged oh uh yeah they prenups
(5:41:00) can be challenged sometimes they can be deemed uninforceable interesting and then it can often times it can I think
(5:41:07) Lucas correct me if I'm wrong it only applies to that which occurs uh or it
(5:41:14) can only exclude that like assets or money that existed prior to the marriage
(5:41:19) but anything earned during the marriage i I don't think I I think legally you
(5:41:25) could still exclude things during the marriage i think I could be wrong but I think cuz uh yeah but we do have to wrap
