(0:12) I'm finishing the stream I I it said all
(0:15) day I told you guys this week that we're
(0:18) I mean we're going to be going till past
(0:20) midnight likely so can't stay in there
(0:22) very long I I know I just want to do it
(0:25) because it's like I want to say stuff
(0:27) like oh yes I really want candid to be a
(0:30) 50
(0:32) person I mean you as a Canadian they
(0:34) probably now these guys are talking
(0:36) about Canadians what the
(0:39) [Â __Â ] what the [Â __Â ] dude what's all this
(0:43) Canadian hate towards my people probably
(0:46) actually um I'd say about 60 to 70
(0:49) sources that they used in compiling
(0:52) it just so you know this is the worst
(0:54) look in the world and I don't know why
(0:57) people do this but for some reason
(0:58) people want to come on why does it
(1:00) matter what your interpretation of data
(1:02) is versus experts
(1:03) who
(1:07) to the ins and outs of research articles
(1:10) why do they do that my opinion doesn't
(1:12) matter it's my own opinion I'm just
(1:13) coming up here I feel like when like
(1:15) this if enough people have an opinion
(1:17) about like chemotherapy isn't good
(1:19) should we
(1:21) make inevitably took her own
(1:25) life was that
(1:28) okay had some like weird ass [Â __Â ]
(1:31) noises in the background thank you Jude
(1:34) that was cool yeah and the whole smack
(1:37) and smack and smacking hello man what
(1:40) your age State why do I get a feeling
(1:42) that this guy is going to mute
(1:44) immediately uh
(1:48) 19 uh political affiliation I don't I
(1:52) don't really have political affiliation
(1:54) to be honest like uh and what and what
(1:56) state are you in uh Texas at the minute
(2:00) and did you vote no but there is a
(2:03) possibility are are you are you yeah but
(2:06) you didn't vote no right and are you an
(2:10) American
(2:11) citizen yes I live
(2:14) in salesman I'm from South Africa
(2:16) originally Petoria
(2:18) go yeah I I hear your accent I I I
(2:21) believe you but but just because you
(2:24) live in America that doesn't mean you're
(2:25) a
(2:26) citizen I have legal citizenship I'm not
(2:29) some sort of immigrant well I am sort of
(2:31) immigrant but not illegal immigrant cool
(2:34) cool but here's the thing you didn't
(2:36) vote and around here we we kind of
(2:39) figure by the way is there's is there
(2:41) any chance you would have voted for
(2:42) Trump yes definitely yeah well that's
(2:46) dumb as [Â __Â ] um but here's the thing um
(2:50) yeah it is it is and you're not thinking
(2:52) and by the way the reason um I'm going
(2:54) to like do is because no vote no voice

(7:27) yeah so you think you think it's a good
(7:29) idea to that Trump added 25% to our
(7:33) nation's debt so what no I just think
(7:35) it's that he cuts the taxes wait a
(7:37) second wait a second he you're not
(7:39) listening no I
(7:42) listen Okay so he he literally added 25%
(7:47) to our nation's debt by giving permanent
(7:50) tax breaks to the
(7:53) 1% yeah he cut the
(7:55) taxes right for the 1% permanent tax
(7:59) breaks
(8:00) that's not true you think that was good
(8:04) yeah because he cut the
(8:06) taxes are you like a one trick pony
(8:09) that's all you can say just do the woman

(15:23) promise you oh okay uh anyway my
(15:26) political affiliation is uh I'm a big
(15:28) time Trump supporter and uh my reasoning
(15:31) why did go okay you're you're up to date
(15:34) go on go go on yeah my reason for what
(15:36) was your top reason uh well I actually
(15:38) voted for him because I didn't want a
(15:40) woman to be
(15:46) president are are you you said you're
(15:48) what 40
(15:50) 41 41 and are you married yeah my wife
(15:53) didn't want a woman to be president
(15:55) either surprising and you have kids
(16:01) yeah um are they school age kids yeah
(16:05) okay and did you are you a Christian
(16:09) yeah you said that in a really weird way
(16:13) well I mean when you you're using your
(16:15) tone in a weird way you said that in a
(16:17) weird way I don't think so I do think so
(16:21) it's called toning it works like
(16:25) this see that's what you that's how you
(16:27) talk it's weird wow it's just weird bro
(16:30) that's weird just weird yeah you're a
(16:32) weird guy so so thank you so um did you
(16:36) uh did you serve in the military no no
(16:40) okay so let's see where we're going to
(16:44) go and what was your top reason again
(16:45) for voting for Trump because he because
(16:47) he's not a woman I didn't want a woman
(16:48) to be president why is that weird
(16:52) why well it's just AE it's just a
(16:55) preference I think that people vote for
(16:56) all sorts of su of uh could be
(16:59) considered to be superficial reasons
(17:00) including women who will often vote on a
(17:03) politician just based on the fact he's
(17:04) handsome not handsome various things
(17:06) like this why did you not want a woman
(17:09) because it's my preference to not have a
(17:11) woman well thank you Captain Obvious I
(17:14) don't you don't need to justify
(17:15) preferences you realize that right but
(17:18) you're on a political line dude yeah why
(17:21) would you need to justify a preference
(17:23) because this is a political life and if
(17:25) you can't State your [Â __Â ] opinion
(17:27) like a grown ass man I just did you're
(17:29) boring I just stated it so let's see did
(17:34) you vote for Trump in 2020
(17:37) yeah okay and so then you're aware that
(17:40) he incited an attack on our nation's
(17:42) capital yeah he's still better than a
(17:47) woman really
(17:49) yeah why well I mean the United States
(17:52) has a long history of rebellion and
(17:54) those were never led by women why why
(17:57) why why why which thing why which thing
(17:59) why why is a man better than a woman oh
(18:02) it's just a preference I just prefer
(18:04) that a woman not be president so did did
(18:06) you did did did you um support January
(18:09) 6th well support it
(18:12) how did you what did you think of
(18:14) January
