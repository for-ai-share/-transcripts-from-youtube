(0:00) definition of bad. I'm going to and this is why we could have cleared out the semantics, but you're so [ __ ] stupid. Now you're
(0:05) going to be at the mercy of them. Deliberately hurting the deliberately hurting the economy of bad all [ __ ]
(0:12) day. You can be as mad as you want, bro, but
(0:18) it's not going to make you win. Yes, it should be avoided. You say yes, it when it will have a negative outcome.
(0:24) Negative outcomes should be avoided when we can. You say that it's not So, this
(0:30) is where he pulls out the notes, the the things that he written down, and this is where he throws it back in his face. Why can't you avoid it?
(0:36) Because I don't run Congress. Okay. Well, then I guess I guess we can't have the legal social security
(0:42) numbers then cuz you don't run Congress, right? Uh but if I say like murder is bad, I'm
(0:48) saying that that's an immoral thing, right? You would agree with me on that? Sure. Whatever you Yeah, whatever.
(0:55) Okay, that makes sense to me. So when you say that contracting necessarily 3%
(1:00) of the GDP is bad, do you mean as in I'm having a bad day or as in this is going
(1:06) to be immoral because the outcomes for people is not going to work out very well? Neither. You just said you you left out
(1:12) one like if I if I make less money that's bad, but that's not really moral. That just makes bad is in a bad day.
(1:19) Sure. It's bad for my finances. Sure. Okay. So then all you mean by bad here is the same as you would mean.
(1:25) You said bad. You brought you said bad. I said okay as the math is I said I think the math is bad.
(1:31) Yeah. So then I didn't say bad. Yeah. But it could be it could be tied to morality cuz Yeah. Why is it bad?
(1:36) Like he's like well it's I'm making less money therefore bad. Yeah. Okay. Well
(1:43) okay. So if let's say we hire children, we had child labor, right? And then we fired them all, right? Because of laws
(1:50) and stuff and we made less money because we did that. Well, would that still be bad or good? Like just because you make
(1:57) less money doesn't mean it's bad morally. So that's why it's important that Andrew is trying to dive into that
(2:03) because what do you mean it's bad? Like so uh we could hire what like child
(2:08) labor but as long as we're making more money than it's good and you said bad, right?
(2:14) I was responding to you saying but that's fine. Yeah. So when you say well hang on semantics are super important for debate
(2:20) and that's why I'm trying to get these things clarified. What do you mean? No, I think I think I would like to talk about the Well, I think what you're
(2:25) trying to do is drag this into a moral argument because I don't think you have numbers to back up anything. That's why
(2:30) that's why my argument specifically didn't talk about morals, Andrew. I talked about actual data. I'm looking at
(2:35) the economic impact of these people and you want to talk to me about morals. I'm not interested in that, Doug. Well, can I try to explain to you and
(2:42) give you an expression of why this is so silly to me? If the economic data that
(2:48) you want backed up, even if I were to grant that you're completely correct, but you say it's not a moral
(2:53) proposition, why the [ __ ] should I even care? You don't have to care. Why should anybody care?
(2:58) You don't have to care. No, I'm not ask I'm not Well, you showed up for a debate. I gave the prompt. Trump
(3:03) deportations do more harm than good. I didn't sign up to debate. Isarm is harm bad?
(3:09) Uh, in this case, I think it is. Yeah. Okay. So, harm is immoral. I don't care about morals, dude. I don't
(3:15) know what you want. I don't know what you want to do cuz I I don't care about morals. Well, at least he's honest. That's pretty
(3:20) telling, you know. Yes, I want my cheap Mexican labor and [ __ ] the morals. As
(3:26) long as there's more money in our country's pocket, then let's keep our cheap Mexican labor. Morals be damned.
(3:32) Just trying to figure out what you mean by bad. No, what you're trying to do is drag me into a moral argument because I'm just
(3:37) trying to figure out what you mean by bad. Your position is based on your morals. My position is based on math, which is
(3:43) why I don't have like this universal look. A lot of the things that you accuse me of, you're like, "Here's what people on the left do. You thought I was
(3:49) going to be against birthright citizenship. You think I'm against deportations. You think that I am pro- illegal immigration. I'm not pro any of
(3:55) those things." It seems like you didn't listen to a word I said in my opening statement and just decided from the get-go that you were going to have a
(4:01) moral discussion here. No, I went down each each point that you made and gave a reputation. My own
(4:06) intro. No, you missed most of them. When you're discussing when you're discussing this though, listen, I'm it's not a gotcha.
(4:14) I'm not even looking for the moral discussion. All I'm looking for right now is to clear up semantics so that we
(4:19) understand we're not speaking past each other. If you're just coming in to say, "Oh, the numbers look good on our side."
(4:25) Great. Who cares? That's not what the argument is about. The argument the argument is about whether it does more harm than good. So when we say things
(4:34) like a harm principle or a good principle, right? If you say if you have neutral, if you're neutral on the fact
(4:40) that if there's economic output, which is problematic, I win the debate by default because you haven't demonstrated
(4:46) there's any harm because harm's not bad. Or if you say um good, when you say
(4:51) good, I assume that you mean that uh this is something which is positive, the opposite of harm, and so that's a more
(4:57) moral proposition. So either of those things, more harm, when you say harm and good, do you mean you mean moral
(5:03) immoral? If you mean something else by harm or good, then I want to get those semantics cleared up so we know what
(5:10) we're talking about. Yeah, I cleared that. This is like the fifth time I've cleared it up, right? Economically, it's bad for our country.
(5:15) I think it does harm to our economy. Bad meaning what? Bad meaning the numbers are negative.
(5:21) Yeah, but that doesn't tell me anything. So, anything anytime is anytime numbers you want me to tell you? Is anytime numbers are negative, is that
(5:28) bad? No, negative numbers like in golf. Sure. So then negative numbers don't
(5:33) just mean bad. So when you say bad in this case it's and what makes that bad though?
(5:39) Uh because because there's less money circulating through our economy. Yeah. But you that that's just giving me
(5:44) one step further in the description. Not telling me what bad actually means. I'm not interested in a in a semantic
(5:50) debate about what bad means. Andrew semantic debate. It's clarifying what you mean by the thing. You're talking you're talking about
(5:56) you're you're talking about the harm principle. You're setting parameters on this debate so that we can so that we
(6:02) can Yeah. What's the What's the debate topic? Not not what is the harm principle? There's lots of definitions.
(6:08) What is the debate topic? Just tell me what the debate topic is. Uh deportations do more harm than good.
(6:13) Is it appropriate for me to ask you what harm and good mean when the debate prompt is specifically alluding to both
(6:19) of those things? Yeah, I think that it it's not the harm principle, though. You can use the word harm in many different ways and those
(6:25) are the ways I'm trying to get you. You could you could and I'm saying that this is a way that it is deliberately
(6:31) inflicted on our economy. Deliberately inflicted.
(6:36) Yeah. But he doesn't get it. Like why is that bad? So why is our GDP going down?
(6:42) Well, why is that bad? Again, if we were like just if we were using a bunch of cheap labor or even just slave labor,
(6:48) let's say we had a we we forced a group of people to just work for free, right? And then all of a sudden, you know, we
(6:55) we laws came about and we we had put an end to it. You know, yes, that would
(7:00) harm the GDP, right? We would be making less money. Uh but is that a bad thing
(7:05) if it means there's no more slave labor? So, this dude right here, he's trying to weeze a lot of and worm out of it. But
(7:12) Andrew is asking legitimate questions here. And um I'm glad that he's making him stick to it. And it's actually this
(7:18) is actually a really genius move that Andrew went down this line. Okay.
(7:24) That is the definition of harm. Yeah. So do you do you realize like immediately the problem that you have
(7:29) here? No. So well I'll explain it to you. So when you say um this this has nothing to do with some
(7:35) principle or anything like that. When you say more harm than good, you're saying that there's a negative there and
(7:41) the negative outcome I would guess is the harm, right? Yeah. Well, in this Yeah. In this case,
(7:47) I think that we are deliberately inflicting damage to our economy and the outcome of that is a less stable economy
(7:55) and that's bad. Yeah. Sure. So that would be immoral. Great. It's immoral.
(8:00) Okay. So it's immoral. So when you say harm in this case, you're saying this thing is immoral, right?
(8:05) I'm not saying any of that. You are if you if we whatever we have to do to move on from this [ __ ] that would be great. I just need you to not
(8:11) I know that this I know it's frustrating because you want to have a moral debate. I would like you to to outline anything
(8:17) I said and we can discuss whether it's good or bad. Okay, I'll explain this to you so that you understand.
(8:23) Pull up the equivocation fallacy for me and read. No. Okay. Do you need me to pull pull up the definition of harm?
(8:29) Yeah, I'll pull up the definition of harm. There's going to be a multitude of definitions, but I'll give you So why so why are you picking harm
(8:35) principle instead of one of the definitions I'm using of harm? It's my claim. It's me telling you what my claim
(8:40) is. Yeah, I know what your claim is, but your claim has to have meaning to me. So, the thing is is I'm going to pull up I'll I'll pull up your definition or all
(8:47) definitions of harm. You can pick one. I'm fine with that. I just did. I told you it was uh it was
(8:52) deliberately inflicted uh uh uh destruction of our economy.
(8:58) So, so that you understand the equivocation fallacy. I'll read it for you verbatim. These aren't even gotchas.
(9:03) It's not even trickery. I'm just trying to get the semantics out of the way so we can get to the debate. Equivocation is the use of ambiguous language to
(9:10) conceal the truth or avoid committing to a specific stance. That's what equivocation is. It involves using words
(9:16) or phrases with multiple meanings in a way that can mislead the listener or the reader. So the reason
(9:22) I just told you what the meaning was. I just told you three times. Bro, can you can you just chill out? Just chill out.
(9:28) But this is silly. It's not silly. It's just that you're not used to actually having to commit to your stance. So quivocation is a use of
(9:34) Yeah, exactly. like you know he's not used to actually explaining well why is it bad and think more about it you know
(9:41) he might think well this is just silly you know he these left lefties they just want to preach their point of view and
(9:47) that's it and they never they don't want to be asked to think about it they don't want to be asked anything deeper they
(9:52) just want to preach this is bad ambiguous language to conceal the truth or avoid committing to a specific stance
(9:59) I'm saying that you're guilty right now of using an equivocation fallacy in your arguments because you won't make such an
(10:05) such such a firm stance on what harm means. I disagree.
(10:11) Okay, then what does harm mean? Deliberately inflicted destruction to our economy.
(10:17) Okay, that's what harm that's all harm means in this case. That's what it means. It can harm can mean different things at
(10:23) different times. But right now, I'm explaining how I'm using the word. Okay. And if you're deliberately hurting
(10:29) the economy, should that be avoided? In my opinion, yeah. Okay. Okay. In your opinion, yes, it
(10:35) should be avoided. Yeah. Is that because it's going to have negative outcomes on people?
(10:40) Yes. Okay. Yes, it will have negative outcomes. Yes, it will have negative
(10:47) outcome. I have a feeling that he's going to regret answering the way. And what I like is Andrew writes it down.
(10:53) So, he can't he can't uh wiggle his way out of this. And I I have a feeling that he's going
(11:00) to regret answering this way as the debate goes on. And are negative outcomes a thing which
(11:06) we should avoid? Uh when we uh I think when we can. Sure. Okay. Negative outcomes should be
(11:11) avoided. So negative outcomes avoided. So to summarize your position on harm,
(11:18) deliberately hurting the economy should be avoided because it will have negative outcomes. Negative outcomes should be
(11:24) avoided. So when we can Yeah. when okay I'll even add that just to uh just to be super charitable when
(11:32) we can. So does that mean that if we're not avoiding negative outcomes when we can that that's bad?
(11:40) Uh sure. Okay. So it's bad not to do that. It's bad not to do that. When I say bad here,
(11:50) do we mean that this is a this is immoral? In other words, is it immoral to deliberately hurt the economy because
(11:57) that should be avoided because it'll have negative outcomes and negative outcomes should be avoided when we can.
(12:03) I don't know that it has anything to do with morals. You don't know that it has anything to do with what is I'm sorry. So, it's not
(12:09) a moral proposition to say that we ought avoid X. I keep telling you none of these are moral propositions.
(12:14) They're all moral propositions. Every one of them they say this those these lefties will
(12:20) say this is not a moral thing but they always come for it very emotional and from a a moral stance. They always say
(12:25) it's not right that Trump or is deporting these people. It is not right. They're the ones that tie morality into
(12:32) this. So he's he's totally full of [ __ ] when he says well I don't care about morals. Well then what the [ __ ] is this
(12:37) about then? Then what the hell is your concern? You know if this impacts the economy
(12:43) well why is that bad? How are they moral propositions? Because when you say bad, you're making
(12:48) a moral entanglement there. And you're saying that because the outcome is negative, was it moral? Should an outcome which is negative be
(12:54) avoided? No. I think the problem that we have here, Andrew, is that you think that I'm going to extend my position on
(13:00) immigration across the board and that I'm always going to choose, and I think this is where this is the problem with
(13:05) this debate. You think I'm always just going to choose um to uh never do
(13:10) anything that has a negative outcome. I think in this instance, it's pretty easy to look at what's happening. It's pretty
(13:16) easy to say where is the benefit. I I I don't know of any. You can maybe tell me what the benefits might be. I don't see
(13:22) any benefits to mass immigration, especially when there's sensible solutions like granting amnesty to
(13:28) people who are here whose only crime is being here illegally, who have been working for decades. I think that there
(13:33) are legitimate solutions and it feels like you want to have a a moral philosophical discussion instead. This
(13:39) is See, so why why this guy irritates me is that see in his his debate with
(13:44) Stephen he made it about oh it's just that you guys don't like brown people which I mean again tying morality into
(13:51) this. He's trying like racism and stuff into it that that's the only reason why we want these people out is because we just yeah we just don't like brown
(13:57) people. Big brain take there me smart. Um so he's like one of these people that
(14:03) like ba bottom line is this is all about Trump derangement syndrome. like this guy has TDS. I think later on in this
(14:09) debate or in the after panel or something like he even said like he didn't hate the debates when uh the
(14:15) debates the deportations when Biden did it. So, okay. So, if you had no problem
(14:20) when Biden did it, but you have a problem with Trump did it. Well, then what else is this then? It's just about
(14:26) oh my orange man bad. this well what you're making there is a
(14:31) moral claim that the thing should be avoided because it has negative impact on exgroup therefore it's I mean how do
(14:38) you get around the fact that that's a moral claim exactly I think look I think that there's very few things that happen
(14:44) inside of a country where there is a government where no matter what side you take there is going to be a negative
(14:51) outcome to somebody right so I'm I'm looking at what what do I think affects the greater
(14:56) so then I would I would just counter and say I can even agree that any type of policy you have will have some
(15:02) disaffected people from that policy the rich or the middle. But you would just say that that's a moral entanglement
(15:08) that it was moral entailment that if the rich suffer so that you know 10,000 poor people uh get their meals you would just
(15:15) say that that's a moral tradeoff right but these are all moral prop Yeah. So these are all moral propositions. So I'm
(15:20) just trying to get to the heart of what good and bad in this case more harm than good. We're trying to figure out what
(15:26) the good is from your view. What is the good? Is the good GDP? Is that what the
(15:32) moral proposition is? More GDP good? Is the good social cohesion? What is the good? Do you want me to read my you want me to
(15:38) read the whole opening statement again? I covered that. If you can if you can read in the opening statement what the good is.
(15:43) Yeah. So, uh it uh it protects us from GDP growth. Uh it
(15:48) Oh, yeah. No, definitely. The morality is is a word that the left redefined because it's like a lot of the left are
(15:55) are are secular. They're atheists and stuff. So pretty much it's whatever feels good at the time. You know, all of
(16:01) a sudden Christianity is immoral now. You know, all of a sudden you talk to these lunatics and it's like, "Oh, God
(16:06) evil, God terrible." Um, but yeah, it's it's all by whose
(16:13) standards? By their standards. Keeps it keeps wages uh uh at least
(16:21) stationary. Uh there's $300 billion or so in uh in spending power that is
(16:28) immediately taken away if you get rid of all those people. Uh you're going to lose especially in rural communities
(16:33) that require migrant labor, both legal and illegal. That's drying up now. So I live in Arizona down in Yuma, Arizona,
(16:40) they're having a hard time finding even legal laborers who used to come here because they're afraid.
(16:46) Oh man, no wonder this guy's brain is fright. He lives in Arizona again. I just came from Arizona. It's [ __ ] hot
(16:52) as hell. This guy's brain is literally probably fried and that's why he thinks this way. Yeah, I think I think I think it hurts farmers
(16:58) and I think that pushes us more towards factory farming which I think is a problem for all Americans. I think it's
(17:04) a problem for all all of our food supply to have that fall into the hands of factory farmers. Sure. So, you're giving me descriptors
(17:10) of things which you consider to be problematic, but you haven't actually told me what the good is that we're supposed to be going for here. What's
(17:15) the good? What does good mean here? I What is the good? Yeah, because more
(17:21) harm than good. So now we've determined that harm is deliberately hurting the
(17:26) economy. I I guess for this specific instance and that that should be avoided
(17:31) and uh yes, it'll have a negative outcome which is why it should be avoided. Negative outcome should be avoided when we can and it's bad to do
(17:38) that. Those are that's your claim on harm. I'm just trying to figure out what's your claim on good. What is what is the good?
(17:44) Well, I don't think it's doing any good. I don't think these deportations are doing any good. Well, that's just evading what the question is. What is
(17:51) the good? How would I tell you what the good is if I don't think it's doing any good? Because the proposition here Well, just
(17:57) wait a second. This is bizarre to me that you would state that you don't think a thing is doing any good, but
(18:02) won't tell me what the good is. Well, I don't I don't know what that I don't know. You don't know what that means?
(18:08) No, I don't know what good means. I don't even know what their intention is. So, you don't know what good is. You
(18:13) don't know what bad is. You don't know what harm is. How would I How would I tell you what the good is if I don't think it's doing any good? I don't know. The proposition is good or
(18:19) harm. So I don't know what debate you're prepared for, but it was does it do more harm than good? So tell me, sir, what
(18:26) the [ __ ] is the good? I don't think it's I don't think there is any good. You don't think there is any good? So So
(18:31) then So that doesn't even make any sense. So he says himself, he's not against deportations.
(18:37) Oh, okay. But then he says, "But yeah, but there is no good." Well, then so
(18:42) then are you against deportations then? Like what? Make up your damn mind. these left like these lefties like they um
(18:49) they're all full of [ __ ] It's just does it do more harm than nothing? Yeah. Well, I I think that uh Wait, why
(18:56) does it have Why can't it be uh why does it have to be good here? Why does it Because you just said there is no Because that's the proposition.
(19:03) Does it do more harm than good? And your response is your response is there is no good.
(19:09) It can do zero good. Okay, but what's the prompt? What's the prompt?
(19:14) [ __ ] Are we going to do this all? Are we going to do semantics on the Can we get the semantics clear? Yes, dude. These freaking these lefties, they
(19:20) always cope like that. They're they always [ __ ] and wh about Andrew like, "Ah, he always gets into the semantics. Ah, he uses all these hypotheticals."
(19:28) But it's because their their beliefs, their worldview makes no sense. So, what Andrew is doing is like picking it apart
(19:33) and getting deep in there and it reveals like they don't really know what the [ __ ] they're talking about. Like they've
(19:40) never had a deep thought. They've never really thought about why they believe these things. He's just been told to believe these things. You know, this is
(19:46) bad. Well, why is it bad? Because Trump's doing it. And you know, Trump, he's evil. He's racist. He's a bigot.
(19:52) He's sexist. He's all of the things. He's all of the bad things. So, if Trump is doing it, well, then it's bad. Oh,
(19:58) okay. Duh. All right. And then they go on, they spew all their nonsense. But
(20:04) that's why they get so like defensive and they they don't know what's going on. They're like a deer in the headlights when Andrew asks these
(20:09) questions because they never thought deeply about any of this stuff. Yeah. I don't care. I Whatever.
(20:14) Well, I'm glad you don't care, but I care. What is the good This is like the dumbest conversation. You want me to meet you?
(20:21) Talk about immigration and not what [ __ ] words mean. So then stop equivocating. Stop equivocating then.
(20:27) Gentlemen, if I can maybe kind of pry in for a moment, maybe maybe offer a thought process RTP in terms of the the
(20:34) harm concept here. Uh like for instance, if you have a company and they're, you know, running a product and they're uh
(20:41) they have a recall on it, right? Because things are going bad. Like what they do
(20:47) to even think about what that recall would be would be is it more money to pay out uh for lawsuits that are going
(20:54) to come our way or is it uh kind of cheaper in essence to recall the item
(20:59) and replace all the stuff and that comes through like the general harm of things. So what would be the good there?
(21:05) So the good would be people get their [ __ ] fixed or people will get payouts for Why is he asking the moderator? Why is
(21:11) he asking Sarah? So what would be the good there? Like
(21:17) dude, this is pathetic for having, you know, they get in a car accident because the brakes don't work, right? Like even the moder has to explain to
(21:23) him, well, this could be what's good to him. It's like he's having everyone explain everything to him. So there are
(21:28) good pieces built in, but also it's the there's the harm principle that's built in behind it and it's the ethical
(21:34) standard uh in any like economical stance, right? Yeah, we make more money, but ethically are we good?
(21:40) So what if the people don't get their car fixed or they don't get their money back? Then is there a good there? How do uh if they don't know about it or
(21:48) what? The the harm, right, was the d was the destruction to their their vehicle. Right.
(21:53) Right. That would be and if nobody fixes it. If nobody fixes the vehicle or pays them damages, where's the good?
(22:00) Uh, the good would be the company didn't lose any money. Okay. So, the the good here is that
(22:06) Donald Trump gets to unless that's bad.
(22:11) Okay. Then Donald Trump gets to fulfill a campaign promise. There's my good then. And so that's why I say like you there
(22:17) there are a lot of ethics to economical stances. So that's what deporting all these
(22:23) people is to him. Just Donald Trump uh completes a c a campaign promise. Oh,
(22:29) really? That's it? That's the only good thing about getting all these illegals out of here again. Again, these people
(22:35) don't belong here. They're here illegally. Nowhere. Where in anywhere else do we
(22:42) allow people to sneak in somewhere and then be like, "Well, they should be here because of this." Like, no. If you catch
(22:49) someone being somewhere where they don't belong, you you the natural response is get them out of there. That's it.
(22:56) Like obviously there there might be some exceptions maybe that I can't think of right now. There's always exceptions
(23:01) there rules, but for the most part you're going to try to get these people out of there. That's it. But for some
(23:07) reason for some reason when it comes to illegal immigrants, no. No, they all should stay here. And how dare Donald
(23:13) Trump try to kick them out. And I think that's that's maybe what Andrew's trying to poke at correctly.
(23:18) In this case, I'm not even I'm not even attempting to do that. I'm not even attempting to get into the ethics. I'm just simply trying to make sure that we
(23:24) don't equivocate. Equivocation being the use of ambiguous language where you mean something by it, I don't mean. I mean
(23:31) something by you don't mean. Right now I don't even know what you mean by these terms because the entire time you've
(23:36) been yelling at me that you don't want to clarify what any of them mean. And that's that to me is absurd. We're we're
(23:42) here to have a debate. I need to know exactly what you mean by the terms in the debate proposition. Harm or good.
(23:49) Hang on. In this case, I'm simply asking you now that we have literally a
(23:54) definition for what you consider uh harm to be. And I read it out to you, agreed to it multip
(24:01) Yeah, I know, right? I got kicked out of the bar and when I snuck back in, the bartender told me, "Oh, dang. You're right." Yeah, I know, right? Like
(24:07) nowhere nowhere does that happen. Only when it comes to immigrants do they argue for this
(24:15) times. I'm just asking for the same standard for what good is. So the good would be that Donald Trump gets to uh
(24:21) fulfill a campaign promise then does that mean all good? So when you say Jesus Christ, bro, what the [ __ ]
(24:30) Yeah. I don't I don't know what you're laughing about. This is how you debate. I'm laughing I'm laughing at this. I think I think this is ridiculous. Like I
(24:37) I think this is You can think it's ridiculous. I would love to I would love to at some point talk about immigration. I would
(24:42) love to at some point get you to clarify what you mean by this. So good is to be desired or approved of. The desire in this case would be Donald
(24:49) Trump fulfilling a campaign promise. Now I've used the word good correctly and told you what I mean by it. I've used
(24:55) the word harm correctly and told you what we mean. I mean technically uh that's not even
(25:00) like uh like on itself like if you want to go into this technicality Trump fulfills a campaign promise. I mean that
(25:06) still doesn't even say why it's good. that still doesn't uh answer how that's
(25:11) a good thing. You could always make an argument that not all campaign promises are good things. So even by that metric,
(25:18) this dude fails, but I guess we'll have to give him that because again, this dude has never thought deeply about
(25:24) anything. So this is the best that you know he's probably going to get mean by it now. Is it possible that we
(25:30) could talk about Yeah. I just want to make sure that the that we're clear on both these terms and you agree to them
(25:35) that uh harm is deliberately hurting the economy and that that should be avoided
(25:40) and that it will have negative outcomes and negative outcomes should be avoided when we can and that that's bad and
(25:46) that's what you mean by harm and that's what you mean by bad and good to you just means to be desired or approved of.
(25:53) Neat. Is that right? Sure, dude. Okay. All right. Now we got that cleared up. So what's your
(25:59) question? I didn't ask you a question. You were asking me questions. I don't have questions. Oh, I You haven't made You haven't made a pos
(26:04) you haven't really made a position yet. You You straw manned my entire opening uh model. You said that you said that uh
(26:11) you brought up social security and that I would say that uh that they're not stealing social security numbers. Of
(26:17) course, they're stealing social security numbers. Is that to be desired? Is that to be desired or approved of?
(26:23) No. So, it's not good. No. That's why I want amnesty to get these people to pay in legally.
(26:31) God, this dude. Ah, yeah. That's why we should just give him embassy. We should
(26:36) just give them security, social security numbers. Bada bing, bada boom. There you go. You know that guy that robbed the
(26:43) bank, stole everyone's money. We should just let him. We should just give him money. Then he wouldn't have to steal.
(26:48) Bada bing, bada boom. Problem solved. So, okay. I see.
(26:55) So the position here is is that that's really bad. Then the economic argument
(27:01) in which you're making that there's millions of dollars going to the government which they don't have to account for actually is negated
(27:07) instantly because what you really want to do is make sure that the local governments don't get that money anymore unaccounted for. Right.
(27:13) No. Incorrect. Because of the it's a small minority of people who are using a so uh stolen social security number.
(27:19) Most people working illegally don't do it with a stolen social security number. So giving those people social security
(27:26) numbers would increase the amount they're paying into social security and Medicare. Wait, back up for me. Most people who
(27:31) are paying into social security illegally are not using a social security number. No, no, no, no, no. Most people working
(27:39) illegally are not using a social security number and therefore not contributing to social security.
(27:45) Oh, I see. So then all of the people So then what you're actually saying is that
(27:51) there's uh hundreds of millions of dollars which are unaccounted for which are going to illegal immigrants uh in
(27:57) the terms of service in the state that we can't even account for because they can't even be tracked through social
(28:02) security. No, I accounted for that when I talked about the money that they're paying into uh local taxes through things like sales
(28:08) tax, property tax if you're a renter. There have to do with social security
(28:13) though. It doesn't have anything to do with social security. We're just talking about social security. So if it is the case then that you wanted to have a
(28:19) social security. What can I just ask you then? Maybe I misunderstood your question. What where's this where's this floating money
(28:24) then? What are you talking about? Well that that's actually what my question is about. I'm asking you specifically if it is the case that
(28:31) you're saying that the reason that we need to give these people amnesty is so that we can issue them social security
(28:36) numbers and thus track their contributions. when I point it out that doesn't make any sense because then your
(28:42) economic argument which is stating that the government should have all this free money that they then don't have to spend
(28:48) back on these immigrants is negated. You said no, no, no, it's not actually because there's millions of more dollars
(28:55) that they would be collecting if they gave other immigrants who don't do that
(29:00) uh social security number and then they would pay into social security and then our receipts for social security would
(29:07) go way up. Then that would in be an entailment then that right now there's millions upon millions of laborers who
(29:13) outnumber the amount of laborers who are spending into the social security system who are getting goods and services uh
(29:20) and aren't well nobody nobody that's illegal is getting goods and services from social security.
(29:25) Uh that's not what I said. I didn't say from social security but so now we're not just Well, you just told me we were only talking about
(29:30) social security. So I am talking but you but you mischaracterized my argument. So
(29:35) my argument would just be simply if there's millions more who aren't paying in than are I don't understand why
(29:42) you're using that as some kind of ideal of well this is actually a good thing
(29:47) because they're paying millions of dollars to the uh to the Hold on real quick. I I just heard this
(29:52) dude like I think I heard him typing things up right now. All these people that have been debating Andrew they they
(29:58) they they have to be typing away as they're debating. Again, these are these people that feel so strongly about about
(30:05) all the things that they preach and everything, but they don't even know what the [ __ ] they're talking about. Like, this dude is is is um chat gpting
(30:12) or googling as he's debating. Like, dude, like this dude did it. That Chuck
(30:19) girl did it. Uh freaking I've seen radical coder do it. Like, all these people, they they're chat gpting in real
(30:26) time. If you don't know this stuff, then why the [ __ ] are you debating this [ __ ]
(30:31) Like, why do you feel so strongly about it? If you don't even know what the hell you're talking about and you have to uh
(30:36) chat GPT during the debate, federal government
(30:42) more who aren't. Yeah. If you increase the amount of people paying into Social Security and and Medicare and Medicaid, it uh it
(30:49) diversifies uh the amount of people. It it means that there's more people paying in which
(30:54) means there's less uh taken out per capita because we have more people paying in. I see. And can you can you answer me a
(31:02) question? Do we spend more money per year on social security than we take in?
(31:08) Uh social security we are not allowed uh to spend more money uh on on social
(31:15) security than we take in. However, the government regularly borrows from it and so we pay interest on social security.
(31:22) government has stolen from. Yeah. And I'm against that too. So in to get this right, what your plan is actually the entailment of your plan
(31:29) is that you would give millions more people social security numbers who then the government would borrow against and
(31:35) we would actually increase our debt because we spend more money uh per year
(31:40) on social security than we get out of social security. So, but hang on. By your metric then, if that's the case and
(31:46) you just agreed that it was, then I would say that that would be a negative
(31:51) because and negative outcomes are to be avoided when we can cuz that's bad and immoral. I actually didn't agree to any of that.
(31:57) Just because there's more just because there's more money in social security doesn't mean that the government will
(32:02) borrow from it. The government has a spending. Can you tell me the last year the government didn't borrow from social
(32:08) security? Well, tell me the last year the government didn't borrow from social security. Let me just finish my statement before
(32:13) you freak the [ __ ] out. Thank you. I appreciate that. Yeah, the government doesn't have to steal from
(32:19) social security. They don't have to. In fact, I think I think Oh, that's a good defense. They don't
(32:24) have to steal from it, but they do. But they don't have to, but they do.
(32:30) That's worse. That we should actively work on electing people who promise not to steal from
(32:35) Social Security. Yeah. Can you tell me how much uh the last Can you give me the last Democrat administration who didn't borrow from
(32:41) Social Security? Uh probably not. I'm not a Democrat though. Yeah. Can you give me the
(32:47) I hate it. I hate it when these lefties these deny like what they are like I'm not a Democrat. I remember you know
(32:53) people brought up David Pacman earlier. David Pacman's, oh yeah, but I'm not a Democrat. It's like oh shut the hell up,
(32:59) dude. Shut the hell up. You're either you're not a Democrat or you're just Trump deranged. That's it. you're one of
(33:04) these never Trumper Republicans or something. Uh but dude, come on. Taylor
(33:10) Loren on the Piers Morgan show too is like I'm not a liberal though. I'm not a lib. It's like just can't these people
(33:17) ever just be honest? Last Democrat or even Republican that didn't borrow from social security? I don't think anybody in my lifetime
(33:23) hasn't borrowed from social security. Well, then would it stand to reason then that the trend would continue that the
(33:29) uh government would continue to borrow uh money from social security and then acrue interest on that thus actually th
(33:35) hang on thus actually uh creating more in the way of debt meaning that they're
(33:40) paying out more than they're taking in because they've accured this additional debt. No, because they're not taking the debt uh the social security is not the debt.
(33:47) The pro the reason that the government takes from social security uh is because it's somebody who will lend to them. Uh
(33:53) maybe if we were a little more strict on social security, they couldn't lend from from social security. But I've seen no
(33:58) evidence that any amount of budgeting is ever going to stop our federal government from overspending. I don't
(34:04) think this is a very good argument. I don't think it's a good argument to more people pay into
(34:10) therefore the government will spend more money. I think that's pretty [ __ ] loose. Okay, then all you got to do is show me the instance or the year in
(34:16) which government the government was not uh taking in the social security
(34:21) payments from all of the benefactors and borrowing against it, thus creating debt. And I think you're I think you're
(34:28) drawing a correlation without a causation there. I don't think that you could say that that our our uh net uh
(34:34) receipts for social security is why the government uh goes into more debt. I think you'd have a really hard time
(34:40) proving that. Then why don't they put it in a lock box? Because they didn't listen to Al Gore. I don't know.
(34:46) Why don't they? Because Because they don't want to. They want to keep borrowing from it. Why?
(34:51) Because it's money that comes in every year. So they wanted So hang on. So to get this right, the government wants to
(34:59) borrow all this social security money that comes in every year, which acrrues debt, meaning that they're actually
(35:05) spending more money than they're paying or I'm sorry than they're getting, right? They're they're spending more money than they're getting from social
(35:12) security by borrowing it. Yeah. Yeah. Great. But they're going to spend it. They're going to spend it. Hang on. I just want to point this. I
(35:18) just want to point out Well, they won't spend it if it's not there, right? They'd have to borrow from somewhere else. Yeah. They'll just sell more sub they'll
(35:25) sell more treasury bonds. Yeah. So under your and they'll sell it to billionaires to billionaires instead of social.
(35:31) So then under your under this plan it actually makes no sense because what you're saying is that all you would do
(35:37) is acrew more social security numbers for the government to acrew more debt from is they borrow against it.
(35:42) No, I think tell me how that doesn't loose. Tell me how it doesn't work that way. I don't I don't think there's any evidence that says if the government
(35:49) started taking in less social security that they would borrow less money. They would just borrow it from somebody else.
(35:55) I I'm so I'm sorry. Hang on. Uh so you're just saying that they would move to to borrowing elsewhere, right? Then
(36:03) that then that's their source. They'll sell treasury bonds and that's bad, right? What do you mean that's bad?
(36:09) Well, according to this, this is not to be desired or approved of. Yeah. What's not selling treasury bonds?
(36:15) No. The fact that they would borrow from some other device other than social security.
(36:20) What, dude? Oh, yeah. No, I I totally agree, Swamp. Like this dude um I was
(36:28) looking forward to him debating Andrew Wilson because he did another debate with this other dude and uh this dude
(36:33) was just unbearable. So when he when it was announced he was going to uh debate Andrew, I got super excited because I
(36:40) just want to see this dude get wrecked. I don't know how to make this any clearer.
(36:46) Are you saying now I'm saying that borrowing is bad? Are you Is that where we're at now? I'm at my claim. You said
(36:51) that borrowing from social security do more harm than good. No, you said that. You brought that up.
(36:57) Borrowing from you. Well, then why would you want it in a lock box? You brought up the lock box. And you said we should do it.
(37:03) No, you said why don't they? And I said they don't listen to Al Gore. Okay. So then they should borrow from social security.
(37:09) Uh no, I don't think they should borrow at all. But that's just economically. I don't think that's like a like sometimes you need to borrow money. Like when we
(37:16) go to war, sometimes we have to borrow money. Sometimes we need to borrow money. We don't always have to borrow money.
(37:22) Okay, got it. So, do you think we shouldn't borrow money? No, sometimes we should, sometimes we shouldn't.
(37:27) Okay. So, do you think that we should be borrowing money from social security? Uh, if we uh only if we absolutely have
(37:34) to. Okay. So, then we should avoid it because after all that would create a negative outcome and we should avoid
(37:40) those when we can. Right. Sure. And if you increase the action that I have a problem with is them borrowing from social security. You're
(37:46) basically this argument could be used to say we should no longer collect taxes at all. We should and we should no long we
(37:52) should no longer be able to borrow money at all. And maybe that's your position which I don't know if you're libertarian. Is that your position that
(37:58) you can't borrow money at all? I didn't say that. No, I'm just wondering. No, I mean I would be I would be far
(38:04) more comfortable with that. But I'm not that doesn't mean that I should abandon an immigration position because it gives the government access to more money. I'm
(38:10) not saying you should abandon the immigration position, but you should abandon the immigration position that the government's going to intake far
(38:17) more money based on the fact that if we issue people social security numbers, people will pay into social security
(38:23) because and here's why you should ban. I never made that. That wasn't my claim. Why should we why should we give all
(38:30) these illegal immigrants then why Okay, then why should we give all of these
(38:35) then why should we give all these illegal immigrants social security numbers again? because it makes the most fiscal sense.
(38:40) Why? There's a I do I kind of read the opening statement again? Because they pay in one, they pay in.
(38:47) Two, if they are here legally, they're more likely to report things like crime. They they invest into the schools
(38:54) locally. Yeah. But let's just start with social security. Yeah. But Yeah. Exactly. On social security, you want them to pay
(38:59) in on social security, right? Sure. And you want them to get the benefits of social security back out.
(39:04) Sure. But if it's the case that when the government borrows from social security and they're giving them these outward
(39:10) payouts after we give them social security numbers, the government's going more into debt, this would go into your
(39:16) rule that that would be a negative outcome and we should avoid those when we can. I think that uh borrowing uh is not as
(39:22) much of a negative outcome against social security. Okay. Why?
(39:27) Uh because it's it's money that uh that gets paid back. So wait a second at interest. But this
(39:34) dude just said that he was like, "Well, we should only do it if it's absolutely necessary." Okay, so then does this fall into when it's absolutely necessary.
(39:40) Like obviously I'm going to disagree with that. I don't think it's absolutely necessary that we need to give these
(39:46) illegal social security numbers and therefore like obviously not. But that's
(39:51) the question I would follow up with. It's like so is this one of those situations that's absolutely necessary that to borrow from social security?
(39:58) Yeah. At interest. Okay. Then that would be a negative outcome which should be avoid avoided because it deliberately deliberately
(40:04) hurts the economy. That's your bad. But but not all negative outcomes are the same. What you Well, then we're back to your definition
(40:10) of bad. Deliberately hurting the economy according to you is bad. We can no longer decide what Oh yeah. So
(40:17) just all things are bad or good and that's according to you [ __ ] thing. According to
(40:23) discussion about I'm giving you the discussion thing to do. That's what I want to do. I think the problem.
(40:28) So how Yeah. So you said I'm trying to tell you your definition of bad I'm going to and this is why we could
(40:35) have cleared out the semantics but you're so [ __ ] stupid. Now you're going to be at the mercy of them. Deliberately hurting the deliberately
(40:41) hurting the economy of bad all [ __ ] day.
(40:48) You can be as mad as you want bro, but it's not going to make you win. Yes, it should be avoided. You say yes it when
(40:55) it will have a negative outcome. negative outcomes should be avoided when we can. You say that it's not.
(41:01) So, this is where he pulls out the notes, the the things that he written down, and this is where he throws it back in his face.
(41:07) Why can't you avoid it? Because I don't run Congress. Okay. Well, then I guess I guess we
(41:12) can't legal social security numbers then cuz you don't run Congress. No, I can't.
(41:19) No, I didn't say you. I said we. Yeah. You and I cannot do that.
(41:25) Okay, great. So then uh legals will never get social security numbers because we don't run Congress. What a
(41:31) great argument. Just because you guys are afraid of brown people. I think that's mostly what it is. Uh see this is what [ __ ] pisses me
(41:36) off about this dude. He makes it he obviously he's going to try to bring it about racism. It's just because you hate brown people. And it's like h this is
(41:43) why I freaking this dude irritates the hot of me. He always had they always got to make it about the race. Like it's just because you don't want them brown
(41:49) people here. Okay. I'm willing to dive into that argument as well. What have I said tonight that said that I was afraid of
(41:56) brown people? And what do Republicans do that makes them afraid of brown people? I said you guys in reference it just
(42:02) seems like you're afraid of brown Oh, it just seems like it's just my feelings. I just feel like it.
(42:08) Oh, it seems like that. Does it? It does. Oh, can you can you justify those seemings with, you know, something more
(42:13) tangible? Yeah, I said it in my actually my opening statement. And I said that I I feel like you guys are uh you're
(42:19) unwilling to engage about policy and about prescriptions. Uh and it seems and
(42:26) I just said I I'm kind of left when you won't engage in anything that I said other than let's find good and bad. Uh
(42:33) and you don't want to debate uh you don't want to engage in this debate. And I know like what your principles are. I've heard you debate before like you
(42:40) want uh your view to rule. You like the the the force principle. You think that your tiny minority of people should
(42:47) should be like the ruling class and people should rule that think like you and I I don't know why you have a
(42:53) problem with this. I that's what I'm trying to figure out. Explain to me why you want all these people deported if economically it's going to hurt us.
(43:01) So here again doing something that's going to
(43:07) economically hurt us uh it's not always bad. Again, if we were just hiring,
(43:13) let's say we had a bunch of child slave labor or something or just slave labor in general and then all of a sudden
(43:18) we're like, "Yeah, you know, this shit's wrong. We're not going to do it no more." And then that hurt us. We weren't as making as much money. Uh how, you
(43:26) know, you wouldn't argue, well, that's morally bad. You would be like, "Yeah, you know, we're making less money, but
(43:31) you know, it's probably good that we didn't have slave labor or in this case with these illegals, cheap labor."
(43:39) That's pretty much all these Democrats. They always even though this guy's supposedly not a Democrat, but they
(43:44) always argue for this [ __ ] They argued for slavery and now they're arguing for my cheap Mexican labor and that's all
(43:51) they always defend him on. They always going to pick our crops, who's going to clean our toilets, who's going to do
(43:56) this. It's like, dude, you guys, the party switch is it's like, how can you
(44:02) say it's a myth when it's like you guys are arguing for the exact same [ __ ] as back then?
(44:09) Here's the thing. I'm willing to uh give you the social arguments for why I think
(44:16) that this would be uh good versus bad. I'm happy to do that, but I would like a
(44:22) concession from you first that when I bring up by your own definitions what these things mean and we could have
(44:28) easily just if you would have just been a modicum good faith and we could have got the definitions out of the way. We
(44:33) could have got into the more of the meat like we were doing right then with social security or we could just do that. Yeah. So, but we were just doing that
(44:40) with social security and cried foul and said when I applied it to your definition of bad that wasn't fair.
(44:45) I didn't say that. Okay. Okay. Well, then why can't I apply it to your definition of bad? No, what I said is it seems like you're
(44:52) setting up a scenario where things are either good or bad and you can't Yeah. And I think that sometimes things are
(44:59) bad and you deal with it. Sometimes bad things happen and you just kind of You also said that
(45:04) and I I think that sometimes what we get what we get stuck with in these debates is we never talk about any sort of
(45:10) solution because we're so godamn uh serious about proving like our world
(45:15) view and proving that the other person's worldview is somehow flawed. So, we never actually get to discuss what I'm
(45:21) here to discuss, which is what's the most sensible way to deal with the fact that we've got a lot of illegal
(45:26) immigrants here and there seems to be a divide in this country on how to handle it. Okay, we can move right into that then.
(45:32) Next, I'll even humor you on this. I just want to point out as you say this, yeah, I don't think the divide is big as
(45:37) you think it is. I mean, Donald Trump run like won in 2024. I don't think it's as divided as you think it is. I think
(45:44) there's just a very loud uh minority of idiots like you that are just throwing
(45:50) big fits and big temper tantrums and that's what this is. I think most people I mean I I forgot I think I heard like
(45:58) the like recent polling say majority are still for this. I think it might get brought up but I don't know. But yeah,
(46:04) regardless, I mean, again, a bunch of people aren't allowed a bunch of people
(46:10) are in here where they're not supposed to be. And no other princ like in no other situation do we just allow people
(46:17) that sneak in just to stay there. Like, we don't do that. We kick them out. So,
(46:23) it's a very simple principle. It's very simple. You're not somewhere you're supposed to be. You got to get out. So
(46:29) why is it all of a sudden for illegal immigrants do we have to be like well you know they're just here to make a
(46:35) better life. They're just here for this or that. And then even if we were to concede and be like yeah you know what you're right. Well then what's going to
(46:41) why even have an illegal uh why do we even have an immigration system if these other people that are trying to come
(46:48) here legally if they see that we're just going to give these people social security numbers and amnesty? Well,
(46:53) what's going to motivate anybody to come in here the right way? Why even bother having a system? Let's just let everyone
(46:58) in. Just just open them borders right up. That you said that negative outcomes should be avoided when we can and then
(47:05) said there's things you can't just you just can't do anything about which are bad. However, I just gave you an example
(47:11) of a negative outcome which could be avoided. You just said it's not possible because you're not in char. Real quick, sorry. This person right
(47:16) here, this donator for uh the debate, Andrew, are you the only online debater
(47:21) not on drugs? Almost all of them are sped out or stoned. They literally can't
(47:27) follow the flow of the topics. Aderal at the very least. And it shows in their outrageous demeanor. I mean, yeah,
(47:32) that's probably true. I mean, the left, they do rely on a lot of drugs, especially for their anxiety or all this
(47:37) [ __ ] They're all on something nowadays. You know, they go, they see a freaking psychologist or something or
(47:43) psychiatrist or something, and they get prescribed something. You know, they have anxiety, they got some kind of mental thing going on, and they just
(47:50) they're all on medication. So, honestly, I'm not saying this dude is on drugs, but I it wouldn't surprise
(47:56) me because a lot of these these libs that Andrew debates or just in general, they're they always got something going
(48:02) on. And then when we like try to prescribe them something that will bring true
(48:07) happiness, you know, uh like uh you know, like you know, eating better or
(48:12) like going to the gym or doing some actual like work, like you know, giving yourself some motivation, starting a
(48:18) family, raising a family, that stuff. They all like h they all spur out about it and like guys don't you think that
(48:25) that would actually maybe bring you some actual happiness so you don't have to be all drugged up all the time of Congress.
(48:31) I think that that's [ __ ] idiot idiotic but I'm happy to move on to the next point of this which is well
(48:40) yeah that's a good point too swamp. Of course people come here for a better life. If we let the whole world in then it wouldn't be a better life. Yeah
(48:45) exactly. You know, there's a reason being selective is better and not just letting
(48:51) everyone in. The most sensible way mass deportation's
(48:58) like 70% approval. Yeah, I know. And then when the left brings up like, "Is this what you voted for?" And it's like,
(49:05) "Uh, yeah, that is exactly what I voted for."
(49:10) Yeah, that's a good point, too, Ortis. 1865, who will pick our cotton? 2025, who will pick our vegetables? Yep.
(49:16) Exactly the same. They always say the party switch is a myth, but it's like, dude, how can you say that? You're arguing for the same damn thing as
(49:23) before.
(49:30) Uh, what can we do about this, right? How what can we do that's the most sensible? Well, okay, here's what we can
(49:36) do that's the most sensible. We can mobilize National Guard, put them on the border with orders to shoot to kill, and
(49:42) we can deport every immigrant who's here. That would not only save us a small fortune, a small fortune in uh the
(49:51) cost of drugs coming across the border, human trafficking costs, what we have to deal with with the Department of Justice
(49:57) and all of these fronts simply do not have to people who are here. Yes. In fact, I'm going to give you one of the
(50:03) most comprehensive studies. Uh one second, which will point out the human trafficking epidemic which comes
(50:10) with uh open borders. I don't I'm not supporting open borders. What are we
(50:16) debating here? Well, we're debating mass deportations. I don't support open borders. Yeah. Yeah. Mass deportations. Now, how
(50:22) is it that these people get here? Most of them on visa overstays. Uh not from south of the border, right?
(50:29) Certainly. It's like 90% of people that are here are here on almost everybody that we're picking up that's at work.
(50:34) They've been here for 15 20 years. And most of you can or you can come here on vacation
(50:40) and you can just stay. Most people don't sneak across the border. Most people come across legally and stay.
(50:46) Okay. So then it sounds like one uh possible way and solution that we can do to handle this is make sure that if you
(50:54) imagine if I were to try to go to some other country on vacation or something, right? You know, I'm just going to, you
(51:00) know, let's say I go to freaking let's say I go to Europe for some reason, right? And then I vacation, then I
(51:06) decide I'm just going to stay. Do you think they'll just let me stay? Do you think they're like, "Ah, he's just looking for a better life here, you
(51:13) know?" No. They would kick my ass out. How come it's like everyone else is allowed to other all these other
(51:18) countries are allowed to have these standards, but we can't. You don't leave on your visa that we have a system in place to come collect you quickly then
(51:25) bar you from the nation for life. I agree with that. I think we should do that. Okay. Yeah, I agree. So then as far as
(51:32) the solution comes, uh what we should do is bar you from life. You overstay on a visa. We have a system in place to come
(51:38) collect you very quickly if you do overstay on the visa. What's your object objection to us deploying the United
(51:44) States military to the border to make sure that there's no illegal border crossings there with drugs? I don't have an objection to that. I
(51:50) have no objection to that. Okay. So then it sounds like the best thing that we can possibly do is remove
(51:55) the illegal immigrants who are here. And also that's where we disagree. That's the part we disagree on.
(52:00) Okay. So let's just say for a second that I uh was willing to have a compromise with you. Every illegal
(52:06) immigrant who's here will grant them amnesty and give them all a social security number. However, we are also
(52:13) going to deploy the United States military to the border. They're not going to allow any more legal crossings.
(52:19) They'll have literal orders that these are invaders, right? And
(52:25) good see good hearing from you, Swamps. Thanks for stopping by. Have a good night, too. By the way, check out
(52:31) Swamp's channel, his YouTube channel. Just you see his logo right here. You see his name. Uh search him out on
(52:38) YouTube. He has like a great channel. Seriously, Love Swamp's channel
(52:45) re to repel them as an invasionary force and that anybody who comes in and overstays her visa is banned for life
(52:53) and that we have a new federal agency which goes and collects them as quickly as [ __ ] possible to remove them.
(52:58) Would you agree to that compromise? Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Well, then what are we arguing
(53:04) here? The deportation, the mass deportations of the people that are here, the millions of people that are
(53:09) here already, the ju the cost alone to deport these people is near a trillion
(53:14) dollars. And when when I'm well, when I'm looking at these people that they're going and that they're rounding up, these people are doing no harm. These
(53:21) are people who are uh their only crime like 75% of the people from LA that they
(53:26) that they have uh rounded up 75% of them have committed exactly one crime and
(53:31) that crime is being here illegally. So I think that the cost of doing that doesn't make any [ __ ] sense
(53:38) especially when we we have uh this will permanently close some businesses. This will devastate local economies and it
(53:44) will take a very long time to uh get back into those local economies and rebuild them. It's not like you remove
(53:51) them and all these job seekers come in and fill those jobs. Economically, it makes no sense. Uh they we're going to
(53:58) lose a bunch of tax revenue and it's going to cost us like a trillion dollars plus all the things that you want to do
(54:03) as far as securing our our border. We want to do Sure. Yeah. Everything that uh that we would do to secure our
(54:10) southern border, it's going to be incredibly expensive. I see no return on that investment. It makes absolutely
(54:16) fiscally no sense to remove people willing to work who are causing harm to nobody. Let them stay.
(54:23) Do you agree with me that you should speak the language of the nation if you want? You don't agree with that?
(54:29) You maybe finish it. Maybe there was a clas was there a qualifier at the end of that. I interrupted. I don't even think we need to go any
(54:36) further than that then. If you don't you don't think that you should uh be speak the language of the nation before we
(54:41) give you amnesty? No. But I do think that you're going to be disadvantaged.
(54:47) Yeah. But who else is disadvantaged by that? Uh by uh not people not speaking the
(54:53) language. I don't know. Maybe somebody who thinks they should get the job just because
(54:59) they speak English. Well, how about hospitals? How about schools? How about places like this
(55:05) where people don't speak the language and so additional resources need to be allocated to them so that they do speak
(55:10) the language? I don't know that they're disadvantaged. I don't know that that's being disadvantaged. Right. Well, we might have to we might
(55:17) Would that be a disadvantage to our nativeorn people to have to outsource this uh into now special categorizations
(55:24) just to get these people up and running with basic words in English? So, no, I I don't see how that
(55:29) disadvantages anybody. So, you don't think that school spending additional cash and resources with ELS
(55:34) is disadvantageous to the nativeorn people there who could be collecting those resources? Well, I think we're going to be collecting those tax. We're going to be
(55:41) And what's funny is that this guy, his whole thing was, "Oh, yeah. What makes it bad is it's the the math. It's less
(55:47) money in our pockets." Oh, okay. Well, won't spending more money on hiring uh
(55:52) you know, uh tutors or whatever the resources that teach these people English. Oh, you don't think that's bad
(55:57) then, Mr. Oh, it's bad because it's less uh cash in our pockets. It's less money collecting new taxes. Anyways, I think
(56:04) maybe if local assessed by property like I've seen I've seen proposals where people uh part of
(56:10) like the amnesty is that they have a remittance fee. Uh maybe it's a 1% tax. I'm actually okay with that too. If if
(56:17) there are local costs that are going to be applied to the local economy, I think local uh communities should be able to
(56:23) assess that tax. Yeah. So anyway, back to the ELS thing. How can it be possible that your
(56:29) property tax assessment which is going towards schools along with generous federal grants which are going to
(56:34) schools, how is it possible that they'll be spending less resources by not hiring ELS specific educators to train English
(56:42) first language to these other people instead of utilizing those resources on
(56:47) the locality of the natives who are there who are paying through their local property taxes for the education of their children.
(56:53) I didn't say they wouldn't pay more tax. I said nobody would be disadvantaged. How would that not be disadvantageous to the people paying more taxes?
(56:59) Uh because like I just said, you're adding people into the pool of taxpayers. And if you want to pass that
(57:06) cost, not property tax. Not property tax. They pay property tax all the time. And
(57:11) they only pay property tax if they own property. Can you tell me how many of these people?
(57:16) I just said as tenants. Oh, as tenants they pay. No, as tenants, they don't pay property. They pay rent.
(57:22) No, they don't indirectly pay it. No. directly assessed from the owner. Listen, I don't know I don't know a
(57:28) single Yes, I'm a landolder. Yes. I don't So am I. I don't know a single landlord that doesn't factor in property taxes when
(57:35) they charge rent. Okay. So, wait a second. So, who's paying the the property tax? I said indirectly. Indirectly they're
(57:43) paying property taxes. So, then they're not paying property taxes. Well, the land the Yeah, the the uh
(57:48) landlord isn't being disadvantaged. He's already paying that money into the community. No, the landlord may not have
(57:54) as high a property tax assessment if they didn't have to spend more on localized school for things like language assessment, right?
(58:01) Yeah. Taxes go up to pay for education. I'm fine with that. Yeah. So taxes. So what you're saying here then is that the net drain from
(58:08) people who don't even speak the language of the nation. There's going to be a net drain on landholders because their
(58:14) they could pay a 1% tax. Their property taxes would would necessarily go up even if you had a 1%
(58:20) remittance fee. Can you show me the math on how that would offset the local property tax? I said a one I said a 1% tax or a
(58:26) remittance fee. But the remittances are assuming that these these monies are going to go back to Mexico, right?
(58:32) What? The remittances are assuming that this money is going to go elsewhere to a different nation.
(58:38) No, I don't know if that assumes that. Then how do you get remittances? Maybe I maybe I'm using the word
(58:43) remittances incorrectly. I think you are. I might be. Am I using the word?
(58:49) How do you get How do you get a remittance?
(58:54) Oh, oh, never mind. Yeah, I am using the word. Uh, yeah, you're using the word wrong. Sorry. Semantics. You know those [ __ ]
(58:59) semantics. Yeah. What I meant what I meant is they'll pay a penalty. A p a penalty.
(59:06) Yeah. For being here illegally when they as part of their citizenship. So, they get an increase of 1% in their
(59:11) taxes or or a onetime lump. Which kind of taxes? Uh, I think you would have to probably
(59:18) uh that's the income tax. No, I think you would have to I think that you would have to pay um uh 1% tax
(59:25) based Yeah, I guess on the income tax. Yeah, sure. It would just be on the income. So, that again doesn't uh solve our issue with
(59:30) property holders and their taxes going up. Doesn't Why not? Well, because property holders paying a property tax on top of their income tax.
(59:38) They're already paying that tax to that goes into schools. Yes. But the problem that you have here is that they would be paying less of
(59:44) that tax which goes to schools if they weren't having more of their resources allocated to non-English-speaking
(59:50) students. I don't think necessar I don't think necessarily the taxes would go up. Okay. Can you demonstrate it?
(59:57) Yeah. They're already paying for these ch like the children that are in school the property taxes are already paying
(1:00:03) for them. So what's the why would the why would it go up? Do you understand that if it is the case that you have 30
(1:00:09) people in a community and your taxes are assessed for that via property taxes and
(1:00:15) there's some sort of levy which is passed what would be on the ballot would be for those 30 people those 30 families
(1:00:20) and they would give an assessment based on that. If it is the case that now you increase the amount of let's say
(1:00:26) non-English-speaking children who are we're not increasing that number. Why would we increase that number? So, you're saying that right now these
(1:00:33) non-Englishspeaking students are going to these schools? Yes. And I factored that into my numbers
(1:00:38) earlier. Well, that's perfect. So, they got rid So, if they're paying taxes, if we got rid that mean that the that the uh the
(1:00:46) uh land owners or the landlords that they some of that would be offset potentially some of these people who are
(1:00:52) illegally here illegally could purchase properties and they could pay property tax. So, wait. So what you're saying is to
(1:00:58) get this right that right this second property owners are subsidizing illegal
(1:01:04) children so that they can learn the language of the nation. And do you think that that's okay because they're already
(1:01:12) paying it? So if you just gave these students somehow a a social security
(1:01:17) number rather than deporting them that somehow is going to decrease property taxes.
(1:01:22) No, it changes nothing. I mean it stays exactly the same. No, it would necessarily if you deported them go
(1:01:28) down, right? Because now there's less students there to support. Yeah, maybe. Maybe.
(1:01:33) Well, then so then uh yes, so I just want to make sure that I got this right.
(1:01:39) Wait, why would it go down this? Because because you're paid inside of schools by the seats. That's how you're
(1:01:45) paid. So you have X. Why do you think they take roll call in a school? Johnny here. That that's dollars, right? Timmy
(1:01:53) here, that's dollars. They're paid by the number of students who are in seats. So by your argument of saying again bad
(1:02:01) deliberately hurting economy and that should be avoided and when it will have a negative outcome. Negative outcomes
(1:02:07) are be to be avoided when we can. This sounds like a negative outcome which we can quickly avoid by simply deporting
(1:02:13) non-English-speaking students along with their parents if they're here illegally. Yeah. I don't I don't think that
(1:02:18) outweighs uh the other economic benefits of keeping them here. Oh, the other economic benefits. So what
(1:02:25) economic that's why I said like you want to do this about principles but I'm just looking at in totality I've already
(1:02:30) factored these numbers in. I did that in my opening statement. I already said that the the cities that are a net
(1:02:36) negative when it comes to immigration most of that comes from educating these children already. That's already
(1:02:42) factored into my numbers. So it's already a negative. And can we avoid that negative?
(1:02:48) Yeah. Yeah. But we but then we lose out on revenue and then that and then that negative becomes larger. And Ken, if I
(1:02:54) grant this that there are cases in which this revenue is going to be saved by the
(1:02:59) taxpayer, especially the property holder, even if I were to grant that in some ways we may lose some revenue from
(1:03:06) a secondass citizenry that you want to keep here desperately. Uh would you say that when you're
(1:03:12) talking about social issues, second class? What do you mean by that? They are second class. Yeah, I know. I just What do you mean by that?
(1:03:18) I'm not talking about I mean they're completely disenfranchised from the nation. Not trying to be offended. I think you are. I mean, they are secondass
(1:03:25) citizens. You're not telling them, "Oh, I treat them like [ __ ] or something." This is probably where this guy's going. But you're naturally secondass citizens
(1:03:32) if they have less rights than the people that are citizens here because naturally you do have less rights if you're not
(1:03:38) legally allowed to be here. That's one of the things um that's one of the
(1:03:43) things that um is not it's not just harmful to American citizens, it's also
(1:03:48) harmful to them as well and used only for the exploitative labor
(1:03:54) of uh massive farms usually. Fair enough. Yeah. So anyway, so back to this though, would you say that there's
(1:04:00) social offsets when we look at the totality of the good of the nation that you need to look at both economic and
(1:04:06) social ramifications inside of the nation for any policy which you pass? Uh I yeah I think that that's I I think
(1:04:12) it could be important sir. Yeah. So when when you factor in the GDP, if I grant the GDP, can you tell me
(1:04:19) what the positive social ramifications are of of amnesty? Yes. Uh yeah, I think more social
(1:04:26) cohesion. How uh I think that uh specifically here in like I live in a
(1:04:32) border state. One of the one of the problems we have especially in neighborhoods that get uh overrun by
(1:04:37) gangs is that you have a bunch of people unwilling to uh call the police, unwilling to report crimes because
(1:04:44) either they or somebody they love's uh uh status is in jeopardy. or even now
(1:04:50) there's people who don't want to because they they think that even if they do have legal status they may be deported.
(1:04:55) I don't know if you know much about the history. So I just want to make sure I got this right and uh tell me if my steel man's
(1:05:01) incorrect. It makes sense to me logically. If you're here illegally, you don't want to call and report a crime
(1:05:06) because then your own status could be in question and then you could get shipped out of the very country you're in. Right. Mhm. So, of course, it would create more
(1:05:13) positive social cohesion if we just granted the citizenship and then therefore those people wouldn't mind reporting the said crimes, right?
(1:05:20) Sure. In some cases, yeah. Isn't that also the case if we deported them? If we deported those people, wouldn't it also be the case
(1:05:26) that we would have a net income or a net increase to social cohesion? We also would be eliminating this problem of not
(1:05:33) of people who aren't citizens reporting crimes. Yeah. Uh, no. I think I think that's dumbing it down to a single uh issue. I'm just
(1:05:41) talking one issue at a time. We're just talking about this one. So are you. Okay. So let me let me make
(1:05:46) sure. Let let me steal men this. You're saying that if it one to one if we deport these people that also could
(1:05:52) increase social cohesion. Yes. Yeah. I agree. Okay. So if this is the case then when I
(1:05:57) ask you for why this would create more social cohesion. uh that actually wasn't an answer on
(1:06:03) that because if we deported them that would create uh just as actually may create more social cohesion because if
(1:06:10) they're not there to have to report that they're the victims of crimes we don't ever have to worry about them to begin
(1:06:16) with as far as the social fabric of society goes, right? Sure. I Yeah, but I think you leave out the people that are going to be uh feel
(1:06:23) like their society betrayed them or their government betrayed them uh for deporting these people. I agree that
(1:06:28) there are maybe people I I don't know what your thoughts are, but there's people probably like Steve and I debated who would be very happy to see everybody
(1:06:34) that looks different in his neighborhood deportate to the contrary. There are also there are also people in
(1:06:40) that neighborhood who that would cause less social cohesion. Yeah, I think well yeah only for idiots like you,
(1:06:46) dude. Only for the freaking libtards would not be happy about that. You're the only ones being throwing these big
(1:06:52) fits and tantrums over it. Even the people who are like not like leftist
(1:06:57) psychos um who are like, "Yeah, you know what? I just thought it was going to be the the
(1:07:03) the hardened crim like the real hard criminals. I didn't think it was just going to be, you know, little Guadalupe
(1:07:09) here just working her corn her corn stand with her five kids. I didn't think she was going to get deported, too."
(1:07:15) Like, even those people uh aren't like throwing as big a fits as you guys. Like
(1:07:21) in the end of the day, you know, some people might feel bad for little Guadalupe and such, but at the end of
(1:07:26) the day, they're not going to they're they're going to move on. They're not like they're not going to throw us big fits. Only you guys, you wackos are
(1:07:33) throw on one throwing fits on this. So, what I'm saying is deport you too.
(1:07:39) I'm kidding. But I'm not. But I am. But I'm kind of not. But anyway, for a
(1:07:46) social cohesion, if it wasn't for the the Democrats uh brainwashing you people, telling you
(1:07:53) this is actually a horrible thing when again every single president has deported people and the only reason why
(1:07:58) Donald Trump is being harsher now, even though I wouldn't even say he's being harsher, I mean, I'm pretty sure there
(1:08:04) was a time there was a lot of people like a lot more people getting falsely deported, like people who actually were
(1:08:09) citizens here getting deported. Uh that's not even happening under Trump, at least not to a massive scale where
(1:08:14) it's a concern. Maybe like one or two people here and there, but it was like fixed right away.
(1:08:21) Um so he's not even doing it that harshly. But the reason why you guys feel like he's doing it harshly, the way
(1:08:27) you because you guys feel like this is worse is because you're being told that
(1:08:33) it's worse. And you're being told that orange man bad and Donald Trump evil, Donald Trump, you know, Hitler 2.0,
(1:08:39) know, Donald Trump a bigot, evil, racist, horrible, horrible, horrible. That's the only reason why you guys are
(1:08:45) throwing these huge fits and these tantrums. But you guys didn't throw tantrums when Biden deported people. You didn't throw
(1:08:51) tantrums when Obama deported teach uh people. You didn't throw any of these tantrums back then. The only thing
(1:08:56) that's changed now is it's Trump. And you guys have all been brainwashed into having Trump derangement syndrome. So,
(1:09:02) when you want to talk about social cohesion, the only people that are not um um joining in on the social co
(1:09:08) cohesion is you guys because you guys are wackos. That's about it. Everyone
(1:09:14) else, we're on board for this. Uh mo majority of people voted for this. This
(1:09:19) is what we voted for. We want these deportations. Uh illegals should not be
(1:09:24) here. They don't belong here. That's it. Bottom line. We are not the world's safe
(1:09:30) space. uh not everyone's entitled to come here. And and and and even if we were to give
(1:09:36) these people amnesty, then again, what's going to motivate anyone else to come here legally? What's going to motivate
(1:09:43) anyone else to come here legally? If they could just sneak in, if they could just sneak on in, well, why come in here
(1:09:48) the right way if they could just sneak on in and be given amnesty? You know, all they got to do is just sneak on in,
(1:09:55) vote Democrat because the Democrats are going to give the amnesty or allow them to be here and then that's it. That's
(1:10:01) all they got to do. So, why should we encourage that? Andrew Wilson did a good job here. I'm
(1:10:08) glad that this dude uh totally got put in his place because he is just insufferable. Can't stand this dude. Um
(1:10:16) typical uh typical liftarted right here. But what did you guys think about this?
