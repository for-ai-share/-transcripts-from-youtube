(8:05) situation yeah so um I'm a virgin I'm sure that's what Brian's trying to get out here um yeah it's uh it's for
(8:14) religious reasons well I mean as a Christian it's something I'm convicted of I mean the Bible speaks on it all the
(8:21) time so that's stance I take on that and uh I take it seriously and more so that

(8:33) go yeah cool cool cool uh Andrew what about you I've been married for a long
(8:39) time okay long time long time gotcha all right cool so uh where do we begin um
() 
(8:49) first I just wanted to say uh this panel is a little uh somewhat impromptu we we
(8:55) had three other people that were scheduled to be on but they canceled couple hours before the show so
(9:01) unfortunately uh I got a statement from Gabby too by the way she's got a text if you want me to read it for you there's
(9:06) there's a statement yeah it's it's not against you it's just like her current dating situation and oh yeah what do you
(9:13) mean what I thought it was an apology statement I might accept I might accept an apology statement but not certainly
(9:19) not a certainly not a here my my DM are open she had to work she got booked on a
(9:26) on a paid gig and paid um oh what yeah that's that's
(9:32) she works you know she's modeling for Nike now yeah but we scheduled this with her
(9:38) like a month ago plus plus not only not because she was going to be the ride for
(9:43) somebody else she didn't come either uh no I think I was going to be the ride for the
(9:49) other person I think they you know she just kind of got the other girl maybe got nervous I don't really know what happened with that cuz they were going to ride with me oh they were going to
(9:55) ride with you mhm I'm getting so many different I I know the viewers probably are not privy to what what's going on
(10:02) here oh I don't know but she said that she was going to ride with Gabby so I'm getting very different stories from from
(10:08) everybody I don't know so uh and you know what's crazy that girl
(10:13) that was going to come with you Shannon she asked specifically for me to make
(10:19) this panel so cuz we were going to do a be that she was going to do it she
(10:25) didn't tell me she was I was um going to come with Gabby no G uh I mean we and
(10:31) we're pretty thorough with our reminders and check-ins and we sent she got book last minute sometimes that can happen
(10:36) when you yeah but what Shannon said Shannon told me that she are you friends
(10:41) with Shannon M but she didn't tell me that she she had booked this with you Shannon told me that she wasn't wasn't
(10:47) comfortable coming with you oh I don't know yeah I'll literally read you the messages so somebody I I believe you
(10:54) frankly but I think Shannon is lying I don't uh Gabby told me she had an emergency but you're telling me she had
(11:01) a booked oh is shann and the other girl that was supposed to come I don't know her that's probably why Oh I thought you
(11:07) did know Shannon no I was just going to be the ride she was like oh it's my friend so that that could be okay everything's changing I thought you're
(11:12) talking about a different Shannon I didn't know that her name the other girl's name was Shannon wait hold on let me just let me look at hold on I'm just
(11:19) curious I'm gon to look yeah Shannon uh well an emergency she had to
(11:26) she had to she had to go make money right that wasy she had she told me she had an emergency but she got a
(11:32) paid uh gig but then that domino effect resulted and and then we had another
(11:38) person flake so it's just uh that's okay there was people that flake last time too and it turned out really good did it
(11:43) though yeah I like it did did it though all right well it is what it is we're we're going to run with it um okay so
(11:52) it's it kind of throws my notes that I'd prepare it all cuz you know I spent three hours yesterday and any case um
() 
(12:00) we're doing it live folks okay so um Where Do We Begin uh oh I mean question so this
(12:07) originally was going to be a plus-size panel uh so I want to ask the the plus-size women here would you date uh a
(12:15) plus-size man uh start starting with you go ahead
(12:20) maybe I should I don't know if you I would you date women I do I do have a
(12:25) limit just not out of like not finding
(12:30) people of certain sizes attractive but just frankly logistically like cuz I'm not just fat I'm like fat fat and I'm
(12:37) very aware of that and um I just feel like I don't know there's just I just
(12:44) feel like it's sometimes more like the aspects of
(12:50) dating make it's more difficult you're saying like if the other person was also was too heavy there would actually be
(12:56) logistical problems yeah I mean are we talking like like sexually yes sexual I mean like I'm
(13:02) just going to keep it 100 you know what I like we appreciate that's exactly what it is so
(13:08) it's not so it's like Dad BS are awesome like plus guys
(13:14) are great but like once you get to a certain point like if I lost more weight and I was dating someone who was heavier
(13:20) then it would probably not be as difficult yeah canz have you tilt your microphone down just a tad perfect like
(13:27) that that's perfect that's perfect yeah have you run into logistical problems like that before I mean not that I can
(13:34) think of I mean I have a pretty great sex life when I'm having when I'm just currently not is it theoretical
(13:40) logistical problems like you s suspect like speculative you haven't tried it
(13:45) with like a really big guy but you you just anticipate you anticipate that there would be I mean basically yeah
(13:54) okay okay so then um the guy you in an 8-year relationship was he more like like a dad bod type guy I mean I mean
(14:01) there were points in our relationship where he was working out and he was he was in shape and points were head more
(14:07) of a dad B yeah I mean okay um I don't really I I mean I'm also like bisexual
(14:13) like queer so um for me um in the aspects of
(14:18) dating like the attraction is important but I have many different types and I'm
(14:24) not I'm very non-judgmental and open-minded so would you have the same logistical issues if it was a
(14:32) girl I mean probably not no huh wait so um I
(14:39) guess to answer the original question though um would you you date a plus-sized guy also or yeah okay I was
(14:47) just like cuz like in the like categories there's like different categories for plus sized
() 
(14:52) people and what I'm considered is like a super fat and so when you're just I'm
(14:58) just a lot heavier and what what are the uh just cuz I'm curious and I don't know what are the different
(15:04) categories is it actually it's like midsize and there's another there's like
(15:10) something in between super fat and midsize and I just can't remember what it is and then above that is infinity
(15:16) fat and like that's like within the fat except in space infinity infinity fat
(15:22) Infinity I've never has anybody else heard I've never heard this wait not saying Infinity you're saying infin
(15:29) infin no infin fat infin infin fat infin wait what is what is infinite uh someone
(15:35) who's above a 6X wait INF infin fat like at that point it's just stretch close so
(15:41) is that like an American 6X or is that like a Japanese there's Fator
(15:47) Japanese dude Japanese exactly fair enough fat is that what they're called fat I just Googled
(15:53) it and I I search that's like that's like the terminology within fat acceptance movements yeah I've recently
(15:59) been speaking out against my experiences in them I was a part of body positivity spaces since like
(16:05) 2013 and um I I I had a Tik Tok that I was a part of from another podcast
(16:11) interview I did that went really viral and um that experience was was crazy but
(16:19) um that was like I that interview happened right before I did a collaboration with obes to beast and um
(16:26) like right before I really have been I've been on this trajectory like of like of a healing Journey like mental
(16:31) healthwise and now I'm like working a lot more on my physical health I'm from my highest I'm down like I think 60 or
(16:38) 80 lbs okay and um actually like I like I'm documenting all this on my YouTube
(16:43) but I just got approve from monjaro and I'm like starting that process and I left the fat acceptance movements like
(16:49) officially a couple months back because oh you left the fat acceptance moving
(16:54) yeah like problem there's a lot of problematic aspects to it but it did a lot of good for me in other parts of my
(17:00) life and like learning to love myself and accept myself because you have to be a own best friend you know so you're
(17:06) trying you're trying to uh do you have a goal weight in mind or uh not really my
(17:11) goal is to go horseback riding and ride roller coasters that's my goal okay what's the TP does anybody know that I
(17:18) think the typical hor is I don't know horseback I think it's like probably around 2 I think it's 250 yeah and so I
(17:27) pulled it up here the the the Fator is not called it's not it's not rude yeah
(17:33) just I me I prefer I don't want to getc I prefer the term fat versus like chubby and fluffy and like
(17:40) that I like being called chubby respectfully okay okay all right per
(17:45) person you know what I mean so hey per person chubby like we need the Poo but also look at me I'm not chubby so and I
(17:52) P what I mean I pulled up the for for the the the fat Spectrum there's small fats mid fats large fats super fats and
(18:00) infin fats wow interesting okay yes um is there incentives to stay in those
(18:05) categories is it like maybe if you're talking to a feeder what's a feeder
(18:11) someone who will try will pay you to eat they like make they like they think it's hot and they try to get you to eat and
(18:16) they like give you money for it yeah I'm an xof model oh I left what does that mean uh I used to be on only fans and I
(18:23) was I used to be in those spaces online Oh I thought about far
(18:28) in the works yeah let's do it she do yeah yeah I think I've
(18:34) actually seen your Tik toks like I said you look familiar and when you said I was like oh yeah I think I've seen you on my you what was what was the Tik Tok
(18:40) that you said went viral for you the war all insane podcast was it about the the incel actually the one that went viral
(18:46) viral was me talking about being groomed into feederism by my stalker oh okay yeah that's a whole thing um but I
(18:53) was I mean and the the big misconception on the Internet is that that's what I blame my way weight gain on which it
(18:59) wasn't I joined when I was already where they pretty much want you to be um I
(19:05) don't have we had another clip from you pulled up but we don't have the one about the the feeder thing okay so if
(19:11) you want how long's that Tik Tok uh it's a it should be only a minute it's a minute do you want to just do you want
(19:17) to just tell us basically what you say in the Tik Tok oh man it's been a while since I've watched it but I basically
(19:22) just talked about like I just basically explained what feederism is and actually more specifically death ISM which was
(19:29) like the hyperfixation of my um maybe we just pull up the Tik Tok we're all
(19:34) saying is like her Tik Tok name what what should we oh she posted it on her Tik Tok yeah that's what that's what if
(19:40) you're able to look look that up for us it's called we're all insane yes her name is d'ora by the way she's amazing
(19:46) she gives uh people platforms to like discuss on their like more serious topics like it's pretty heavy seem like
(19:52) a good I watched some of it yeah she just kind of sits back and lets you talk and is she in the LA uh no Maryland
(19:58) actually she Maryland okay yeah yeah yeah out in the stick yeah well I flew up there for that and it was a really
(20:05) great experience she's so warm and welcoming I love her gotcha while Nick gets that pulled yeah oh you think you
() 
(20:11) got it the insult one or the other one this
(20:16) one okay mhm hi my name is Rosie and I was groomed into feederism feederism is
(20:21) a kink like a sexual King regarding feeding someone generally for the purpose of them being being fat or
(20:28) getting fat or gaining weight there's a big umbrella when it comes to feederism and the thing about this guy is I think
(20:35) he was into what's called death feederism and death feederism is what it sounds like it's feeding someone to the
(20:41) point of getting so fat and so big that they die that's is that like the movie Seven
(20:48) yes yeah yeah wait where did you see that at where's seven where can you watch that yeah that's BR Brad Pit I
(20:55) think a there was a scene in the movie where they they made a this serial killer guy made him eat
(21:03) made a do to eat himself to death I mean that's the like that's incredible that's like the torturous like darkest like
(21:10) Twisted version of the most dramatizing a little bit extreme right and this that
(21:15) that's the point like death feederism is the most extreme version of it but really it's like the accumulation of
(21:22) like what the smaller parts of it that seem more innocent more incestuous and that was the relation your year was that
(21:29) no no I had a stalker it was the same timeline and it's a long story I won't
(21:34) be bother getting into here cuz I've be dominating conversation but I just have one question how do you know the difference between the person who wants
(21:40) you to die from feederism and the regular feederism don't doesn't seem like they all would want you to die
(21:46) that's a great question and uh yes and no yeah because most of them just don't care about whether or not you're going
(21:51) to die because they're getting the Rocks off um so it's not an aspect to them
(21:56) some of them are turned on by the extremity and
(22:02) the uh I guess the got be control of some sort yeah it is and I mean what a
(22:08) lot of people present it as is like it's like being nurtured and cared for but
(22:14) what it is is it's actually like the toxic version of that because the real
(22:19) incentive is um there's aspects of it where some and it's not I'm not speaking for everyone because some people
(22:25) especially in the community hate me because I talk about my experiences and how I really feel about it now since
(22:31) I've left it um but they like worst Parts within that sphere it's like
(22:38) trying to hold someone down or um because of society's perception of
(22:44) women's bodies they see it as like a oh like other men won't find her attractive
(22:49) it's like you know the incentive of being immobilized or whatever is like
(22:55) about control and that's for the worst and the darkest parts of it but unfortunately it's very prevalent in
(23:01) like the um communities I'm not going to say the name of the website for several reasons but there's a specific website
(23:08) where like you really see it in extremity and the the community within
(23:13) feederism allows people to really just kind of sit in
(23:19) their their like you know what's the word I'm looking for um
(23:26) like it's what my head but basically
(23:32) like well I have a question for you I lost that's totally totally fine um so
(23:37) how you said the guy who was trying to feed you to the point where you could potentially croak well well what I said
(23:45) was did you date did you date that guy or he was my stalker so I met them I met my ex and my stalker within three days
(23:51) of each other um we met offline and I really quickly realized I wasn't into the other guy and wanted to start the
(23:58) other guy he blackmailed me he um
(24:03) basically made it to where like I couldn't remove him from my socials or he showed me like his abilities to clone
(24:11) phone numbers um like hack people like it was insane stuff and so I'm just
(24:17) giving you the really brief version cuz I don't how long ago was this so um I met them some I think at some point in
(24:24) 2012 2013 and um I met them separately and I was very in
(24:31) it was basically one of those things where I was just like talking to people to potentially date and IED stalker I
(24:37) picked who I wanted to date who wasn't the stalker and then the stalker um I mean in in uh 2021 was when
(24:46) he like hacked my cash app and cled my phone number and did a whole bunch of stuff cuz he played the long game when I finally blocked him that's when he he
(24:52) kept his word to me is he still um I scared him off cuz I got
(24:57) background checks I got his information the police didn't help me so I let him know I was going to blow his life up if he didn't leave me alone well sorry to
(25:03) hear you went through that that's uh was he um how was he grooming you into
(25:09) feederism I'm going to be careful what I say because of how the topics go I talk about this in detail on that podcast but
(25:17) essentially um in the cson of things that happened I was forced to meet him
(25:22) in person when I didn't want to because I had family in a city where he lived okay and if I didn't things were going
(25:28) to transpire yeah we don't need to we don't need to go basically it my yeah exactly so but that
(25:36) scenario had something happen related to the topic and then in the conversations where I was forced to talk to him and I
(25:44) and I knew that I could not talk to him he continued those conversations and the
(25:49) negging and several other things and the man knew I was yeah and we can definitely try to re revisit it um I
(25:55) just want to get Misty in here um um so would you date a plus-size
() 
(26:01) guy um I have once okay are you
(26:07) attracted to plus-size guys I'm attracted to intelligent guys who have
(26:13) active Lifestyles who will treat me like a princess doesn't really answer the
(26:18) question though yeah because I don't really believe that it's going to be like you know like I say no and then
(26:24) someone could then someone could like change my mind and so then I was wrong well do you remember like for example last episode we had I forgot her name uh
(26:33) what was her name the girl that was sitting there do you do you recall I'm not the name girl but she was really sweet yeah sweet girl but she said um
(26:39) she was she was also plus-sized and she's like not attracted to overweight plus-sized guys uh so yeah that what
(26:48) what she was talking about was was more of a self-esteem issue she said she didn't want to be like that so she thought that that was going to lift her
(26:54) up and like make her something for me um I don't I don't know I just when you say
(27:00) you could change your mind doesn't that infer that right now though you wouldn't um it would depend on the
(27:07) person it really would it would depend on the person um the dates that I've gone on recently haven't
(27:14) been so uh like if it was just in a
(27:19) vacuum just their looks so I mean obviously if you meet somebody online you're probably going to like ask him a
(27:25) couple questions to figure out do I like this person but so I guess just looks
(27:30) wise would you be attracted to someone who's plus SI it really would depend it really really would depend it really
(27:36) would um genuinely generally I'm attracted to like athletic toward built
(27:43) um exes have all been pretty athletic and the guys I'm talking to now are athletic so but that's also because I'm
(27:51) I was an athlete growing up and so I was always very active um I was also chubby then but um so that's just part of of my
(27:57) lifestyle so I think that's probably what I'm around like what I see at the gym or so I guess it would have to be
(28:03) like so I I just tell me if this is a fair assumption so you probably say that
(28:09) you're not inherently attracted to plus-size guys but you would be
(28:15) attracted to the other things that they would be able to offer so like say they it would depend though it really would depend cuz there's there's plus siiz men
(28:21) that are really really attractive well can I can I take a stab at this maybe so assume that you had Two Men and they all
(28:28) had the same personality traits that you just loved but one was super fit and one was not right if you had to choose one
(28:36) of those even though their personality traits you love Lov them the same which one would you choose who has the
(28:42) bigger who's got the bigger okay they have the same size dick I guess the one who could go longer
(28:49) no okay they both go the same length well then I guess it wouldn't matter can I have them both no you just get one
(28:56) which one would you pick I don't know that I would I don't know like that's for me that's the wh ifs are so crazy
(29:01) but like I don't know like right cuz I'd have to have it happen and like in what world would that happen well I mean it
(29:07) doesn't need to map on to reality ask and testing just testing the preference
(29:12) right yeah so but I just I couldn't tell you like I would really it would have to happen for me to be like yes for sure
(29:17) cuz life and I'm a strict believer in like Universe and everything happens for a reason has so many times shown me the
(29:24) exact opposite of something I thought that I don't I'm not going to claim to be like oh no not
(29:29) this huh um so I mean and to be fair I mean I've also changed men's mind about
(29:35) they don't want a DAT a plus girl and they're like but I'm into you so I'm I'm I don't know I just you love those looks
(29:42) Brian I don't know what you're talking about uh okay so the answer sounds like
(29:49) a no you can call what you want to call it I'm I'm not not to it I just it depends avoiding saying no are you on
(29:55) dating apps I am on dating apps so the people that you're swiping ride on are they would you say that they're I would
(30:01) say I'm looking at how tall they are um what is their job and what is there like picture showing um I've swiped yes to
(30:10) both yeah yeah especially if they look like if they say things that are going to make
(30:16) me like feel good like you know I'm I'm a nice guy I don't know what they would say but something something that would
(30:22) make me be like oh he seems cool she got a paid
(30:28) gig she got a paid gig and she knows it hours before the
(30:35) show sorry I'm just still CAU up on my pH Inspector Gadget over here like wouldn't you and she she got a paid gig
(30:42) on a Sunday I know that she loves you so much though sorry I'm just salty about
(30:48) this um I I'm still confused about the Inspector Gadget yeah that was that got me oh cuz he's trying to like make his
(30:54) wheels turn to try to figure something out you guys never watched inspector G watch you know in advance if there's a
(30:59) paid gig and how many gigs are on like Sunday like I would say like Sherlock
(31:06) Holmes okay that would have been cool too yeah usually like you say Inspector Gadget cuz there's gadgets involved
(31:12) exactly cuz like arm pops off get that comes to my mind wait so were you uh your answer to
(31:19) the would you date a plus-size guy yeah yeah okay and it we'll just ask the whole table would you date a plus-size
(31:26) guy yes okay I is there any room for you this is
(31:31) it too tight okay that's fine that's fine just go ahead um I have like a
(31:37) limit like I like Dad bods okay I like Dad bods you like Dad bods all right
() 
(31:43) truthfully no what if so you're currently dating Frankie right what if Frankie just like went to Chow toown and
(31:51) just I would never let him get to that point what if he what do you mean Frankie's a giga Chad alpha male what do
(31:57) you mean you wouldn't let him get to the point he's just like I don't care what you have to say Madison I'm going to eat
(32:02) Chick-fil-A every day Frankie are you listening bro just start eating a bunch of p no I'm but like what if Frankie
(32:08) just started putting down the pizzas I feel like still I would G what do you mean
(32:16) let him what if he just did what if you just start I'm the person that feeds him I'm the one person that cooks for him
(32:23) I'm not going to oh yeah you guys live together right yeah uh um what if he was
(32:28) like behind your back when you went to work he like had a bunch of snacks and
(32:34) and you didn't know about it he does eat a lot he just has an issue with gaining a lot of weight so it's not even
(32:40) like I have to I can put him on my diet there you go yeah which I'm I'm getting a little along very well I'm getting a
(32:46) little CH but uh okay all right so uh but if he got what let's say just he happened to you know he had like some
(32:53) storage unit somewhere and during the day he would just run to the storage unit and that's fair yeah maybe I would
(32:59) think about it okay all right uh what and asking the men here would you guys date a plus-sized
() 
(33:07) woman no no Chon no no never what about
(33:14) a thick girl depends on how you define thick thick is very different from plus yeah
(33:20) it depends on how you define thick I mean I like a good waist to hit ratio I like a little bit of I like thick thighs
(33:27) I guess you could say um I need a little bit of recoil but not recoil yeah I need a little bit of recoil okay I need a
(33:33) little bit of recoil back shots got to look crazy um but in terms of like the
(33:39) midsection like arm flap things like that I'm not attracted to that so okay
(33:47) um Mason what about you yeah um H yeah I probably wouldn't I I mean like what if
(33:55) she was a what if she was like a Christian virgin though well is that
(34:00) that's what the other girl was last time she was a virgin remember yeah and she was Christian oh so this would have been
(34:07) perfect match made in heaven yeah fact now so like I don't know the kind way I
(34:13) kind of look at it so I mean gluttony in the Bible is defined as a sin and it's
(34:20) not just like it's not gluttony just in the sense of eating a ton of food it's
(34:25) like also partaking in other things too much so but it can pertain to food so in
(34:31) that sense it would be like so you're you have the sin of gluttony but then you take it all the way to its final
(34:37) stage which is being overweight um so I would say it's a
(34:43) heart issue but also there is like it is like an illness or disease so like there
(34:49) are there are mental things that uh play into being overweight that have to be
(34:55) taken into account it's not not just as simple as eat less and exercise more I mean it is as simple as that but it's
(35:02) not as simple as that because if you did those things you would lose weight but at the same time you have to take into
(35:08) account the psych psychological effect so I understand that but then so I see it as like sin issue I also have a
(35:14) pretty active lifestyle I want someone to be able to do stuff with me someone who takes care of their body that's a
(35:20) high priority for them because it's high priority for me it's also just what I find attractive so it's just all of
(35:25) those things kind of put together they like some sort of illness that predisposes them to be obese so they're not sinning they're not being gluttonous
(35:32) maybe they consume less calories than you would you take that into account or are you still just not attracted to it
(35:37) so okay what it's impossible to be in a
(35:43) caloric deficit and gain weight so if they're eating in a caloric deficit it
(35:51) is a physical impossibility to gain weight so is that true I'm pretty sure
(35:56) you could just have a a super low metabolism it that's that's well so that's caloric deficit means that you
(36:03) are eating less than your body is using so you you in order to be in a
(36:09) chloric deficit you have to be using more than you're consuming it's like if you're if you it's like saying that I
(36:17) could if I put less gas in my car than it needs to actually make a trip that it
(36:22) could make that trip that's impossible right so maybe they're not in a chloric deficit but they're also not being gluttonous is my point M well so if they
(36:30) are overweight and say they're just in a maintenance stage like they're maintaining their weight but if they are
(36:37) overweight it's also uh in the Bible we're called to
(36:42) Steward things well Steward things wisely our health as well as our finances all of our resources whatever
(36:49) so I want them to Steward their health well as well so if there are plenty of
(36:56) uh negative to being overweight in the area of health and I would want them to
(37:01) work with me so that we can hopefully get that down cuz I want them to be around with me for a very long time I
(37:07) want them to see my like our grandkids maybe great grandkids that'd be pretty sweet but yeah I think being overweight
(37:15) would limit their ability to do so okay so you'd feel like equal repulsion to
(37:20) someone who's also like unhealthily underweight exactly yeah okay and if you were married to a woman and she birthed
(37:25) your child and and you know she had some trouble pushing off the weight afterwards M would you be lenient with
(37:31) her oh yeah of course I mean but would you consider her gluttonous for maybe like spending a few years I don't know
(37:36) just enjoying her mommy weight well so I don't know well if she's I I would want
(37:42) her to probably maintain her active lifestyle so like uh there's a lot of research that's been done into so people
(37:50) or women who have U as they're pregnant studies into is it safe safe for them to
(37:57) exercise while pregnant uh I know in the powerlifting world so squat bench and deadlift uh it is perfectly safe to
(38:04) maintain your habits in the gym as long as there's like no discomfort like if
(38:10) it's it's painful okay maybe we'll like change the exercise selection but it's safe to maintain physical activity while
(38:17) pregnant and then afterward like of course I'm not going to like dump my wife if she gains a little weight after
(38:23) she's pregnant like I'm going to try to work with her that MH cuz I love her
(38:29) more than just like her physical appearance and I appreciate you saying
(38:34) um the aspect about the uh you know it being mental and not just down to
(38:40) caloric cuz like that's the mechanics of it but the entire compassing issue
(38:45) especially I mean like I for me specifically it is far more complicated than just um eating less because I mean
(38:54) I I do I have multiple Eating Disorders I have multip uh chronic illnesses and invisible
(38:59) disability I mean I'm I'm considered disabled with the diagnosis that I have and that's not my weight outside of my
(39:07) weight I'm disabled yeah and whale donated
(39:13) $200 my sprinkler goes like
(39:21) this that's really funny
(39:30) thank you thank you that's good $200 make it longer next time just to say that we could do a beat so we can rap to
(39:37) it whale whale whale all right we have uh Brady beard here Brian I don't even
(39:42) know what to say LOL you you've really outdone yourself with this panel from Maddie to the left it's nice to see you
(39:47) all uh based Christ is Lord okay Christ is Lord right there you have it thank you whoops hold on just one sec
(39:55) um well you're married so I don't know if it's fair it's fine I speak to it my wife put on some weight after she's had
(40:02) many children so yeah she put on some weight took her a few years to burn it off now I might just have different
(40:09) preferences cuz I didn't know I just didn't even really notice it very much um that's just me personally right but
(40:16) it could be that frog in the boiler effect where just because it happened gradually over time I just didn't really
(40:22) pay much attention to it but then she burned most of it off so right you know I just didn't didn't
(40:28) think much about it honestly there you go folks are you the same just out of curiosity as you were H are you the same
(40:35) as you were yeah I haven't really fluctuated much in weight my whole life okay not much how about you Brian would
(40:42) you date a plus-sized lady would you date a plus-sized
(40:49) woman if they have a big labia plus- siiz labia the biggest one
(40:57) you've ever seen the biggest one I've ever seen like yeah how plus-sized are
(41:02) we talking here do all plus-sized women have plus siiz no that's not a thing no that's not how that works that's like
(41:08) asking about a guy being you know the is you know sometimes it's not is good
(41:14) maybe I you give it a chance you know okay you know it's got to be you changed your tune a little from last time last
(41:20) time you were like hell no we won't go I mean I'm still pretty much on that
(41:26) I that's not what the people just heard am my being a hypocrite I don't know uh not a hypocrite but who knows
(41:33) you you threw in the caveat of she has like for example if if she was also like a billionaire and she's like Brian let
(41:39) me just retire you marry you without a prenup I might have to go for it you
() 
(41:46) might you be like yes Mommy Take me stop Oprah any billionaire are you kidding
(41:52) What's the lifestyle like you got to wear a collar be on your got to uphold my whoa okay no no no I
(41:59) ain't doing no you're not going to do that that's you won't do for your for a billionaire yeah no no no he's got Pride

(42:19) run into a billionaire woman who will retire you so let's say you're a brick layer making I don't know $70,000 a year
(42:25) I don't is maybe more maybe less and you don't have to do that bra back breaking
(42:31) work anymore but no but no she wants to
(42:37) three times a week walk around a callar on the house around the house that's going to be a yes yes for me I don't
(42:43) think so I don't think so H okay would you say you were into
(42:49) last time what if it's shorter Asian you said short chubby Asian ladies you said you kind of like I could I could seey I
(42:55) think she a little a little chubby I can do a little chubby but like I don't know if I could date no no hate or anything
(43:02) just my personal preference I don't think I could date like a plus-size plus-size woman a a little belly fat
(43:10) that's okay little chubby yeah I can I can do
(43:15) it I don't know why I'm talking like Tony Soprano now but that's how
(43:20) Inspector Gadget talks ex exactly I like Inspector Gadget it's my kind of go to
(43:26) you're right no on wait aren't you are you a singer oh it sounds like I do but
(43:32) no okay I can like hum pretty fiercely I was going to see if you could sing the Inspector Gadget theme song Inspector
(43:40) Gadget I can already tell that I don't like you okay um I missed the whole Go
(43:46) Gadget Go part go gadget go good times wait oh okay we got a so
(43:53) okay we got we got single single single single relationship and then single
(43:59) single sing okay um so you said you've been single for two years correct yes
() 
(44:05) about about so okay and by choice by choice um are you said you used to do o
(44:12) are you still doing it or not uh I used to do it well I used to so before I actually made an O I did
(44:21) like I I've always compared it to like the high highend escorting version
(44:27) of virtual content creation where I just kept like a Google Drive and I would
(44:32) only sell privately through me for like I and I wouldn't go below a certain monetary number like you had to spend
(44:39) minimum this much and you would get what you paid for but um I didn't have streaming services like o or any clip
(44:47) sites because I had had some issues with people on the internet in the past and
(44:52) so um it I just felt it felt safe even though it's technically not but I did
(44:58) eventually create an O and then um not long after that I left because I left
(45:04) those communities like entirely right well so uh you've been single by choice for two years but in that twoyear period
(45:11) I mean have you been maybe you didn't have a boyfriend but were you dating any situationships friends with benefits
(45:17) anything like that or not I mean I have like a couple like longstanding like
(45:23) situationships if they come to like fly to see me um and it's like one of them I
(45:30) saw like in February just cuz life's busy you know they have like a high-paying like important jobs so I
(45:37) always I used to see them like more regularly but eventually just kind of like fizzled out cuz I used to also live
(45:43) closer to them so that changed things too okay so you you it sounds like you
(45:50) have currently a couple ongoing yeah like if we talk we talk and like it's so good ter and um in the past
(45:58) you know couple years especially I've just been more hyperfocused on myself
(46:04) and like I want to have like a long-standing committed relationship that's my goal whatever that looks like
(46:11) and um I also have just kind of realized that like the frivolous dating the like
(46:17) dating app games the meeting for coffee and like um going on dates every other
(46:23) week life is just not what I want I want something a lot more like real and
(46:28) emotion based in the current dating field and dating game just grosses me
(46:33) out and it's just um it's just something that I don't want to put a ton of energy
(46:41) into and it's just like people like playing games or whatever you I mean you know how it is I know how it is it's I
(46:47) know how it is ter if you've ever been on know what it's likeif you got Bumble hinge all these
(46:55) apps farmer only Christian Mingle these apps you know maybe have you tried that one Mason um
(47:02) so when's the last time you were on the date recently any recent you know prospects or not so much not recent but
(47:10) I did go on dates like once I moved to Florida so I moved to Florida in October of 2021 okay and so
(47:17) my initial thought process was kind of like um getting under someone to get over them and I did that for like a
(47:24) month or two and then I was like I'm out this is this is dumb wait get get under some get under someone to get over them
(47:30) yeah like I had that mindset and then I realized that like that's that's not
(47:36) healthy how and you said that lasted for like a month month period a like month a
(47:41) couple months like cuz I I was like on Facebook dating and Bumble specifically
(47:47) and so how frequently were you going on dates during that period um sometimes it was like two a weekend sometimes it was
(47:54) like every other week it just kind of depend I mean I um I
(48:00) was I think I was working a part-time job at that point cuz I was still kind of recovering from some stuff I like
(48:06) took a break from working for a little bit and and so how long um so you said you were going on a couple days um you
(48:12) said get under someone to get over someone so we're talking kind of like just casual hookups type stuff like the
(48:20) the first couple times yes like cuz the first guy I met up with um he had a
(48:26) really weird name his name I don't want to say it but it was it was it was fish
(48:33) fish his name was fish fish fish dead ass like his legal name like the animal
(48:38) his legal name name I mean I did did I ask for an ID know but that he went by
(48:44) fish fish yeah like it's just fish was he pescatarian by chance we didn't get to
(48:50) know each other that well I was still emotionally very unavailable at that point so Arians don't eat fish yeah
(49:00) yeah Seventh Day Adventist yes wait so
(49:05) question for the ladies related to fish here if you were dating a guy named fish
(49:11) would that make dirty talk a little difficult oh fish yes yeah feel so
(49:19) good now by the time that's happening I probably like you a lot I'm probably used to your weird name so I'm probably
(49:24) going to have fun with it if if I was dating a girl named fish I would have to change her name I'd have to call her
(49:30) like f dog is that would be
(49:35) better I think it would be better I think it' be better why o f dogs better than O Fish I
(49:42) don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know okay I didn't think it through I didn't fully think it through um wait so okay his the first guy was
(49:49) named fish and uh and he uh any other you know
(49:57) situations you know um I think the most this is just thinking to this isn't even when I was dating in Georgia but um
(50:03) because we my ex and I we broke up for 9 months like four or 5 years into the
(50:09) relationship and um that was a time but in Florida I
(50:16) think the most notable date cuz like I I went on like a couple ones like with the dinner dates whatever um especially like
(50:23) cuz like my first couple dates I was just kind of like like I said that was my mentality and then I was like I'm out
(50:28) and then I started trying to do like more like structured dating actually trying to find something serious yeah
(50:35) and then I was like oh I'm not ready so that's when I backed out I was like cuz I'm not was back out totally yeah that's
(50:40) when I quit dating apps I've been it's been about a year at least a year and a half I don't see I I just one day out of
(50:46) the blue decided to quit dating apps and I didn't even realize it that I was going to make it a thing for a couple
(50:52) months so I don't know I don't remember the exact pinpointed time right but I know for sure a year and a half and um
() 
(51:00) but the other one was when I went out with uh a guy with one leg damn yeah I
(51:06) dating in Florida is weird amput yeah dating in Florida is weird that's the problem it's where I live and that was
(51:13) reason why I was like I'm out where are you meeting guys if you're not using dating apps at the time I was using them
(51:19) and that's this so those were my my stories before I quit because I decided I didn't just quit dating apps I quit
(51:25) dating period And I did some like light talking phases but nothing stuck and I've only been like feeling like in the
(51:32) past couple months that I might even be ready to start dating again I've just been I've been flirting with the idea of
(51:38) downloading the apps again but I just haven't like launched during your uh get under someone
(51:45) phase how many people did you get under in Florida a couple a a couple one leg
(51:53) guy was one of them yes you you got under one leg
(51:58) go we talk about logistics well yeah did that create logistical problems actually
(52:03) it made it easier oh easier I could kind of see that me too I can it's it's one
(52:12) last Li yeah but how did he get leverage there's ways when there's just
(52:19) crawled on top of you when there's a will there's a way he he has a a what's
(52:24) it called a pro leg Yeah right no he didn't no she mean like one leg oh okay no I mean I mean at
(52:31) least during he didn't wait so not two legs then I kind
(52:36) of I kind I would date an ampute I mean me too that's what I say it was it was chill well it's easier for us again I
(52:43) was just so emotionally like not available have you have you been with no
(52:48) I'm just saying like in in hypothetically logistically no it's easier for us yeah today today n the nut
(52:57) dat yeah yeah because yeah I would I would go for a w double
(53:04) ampute oh my God whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa Nick Jesus Christ this guy's going
(53:09) get me canceled over it's not even on the show okay um like would it have to be a configuration though could
(53:15) it be like both arms or both legs or does it have to be one leg and one arm I'd want double leg that's what he was
(53:22) meaning I'd want double leg Mt okay what are do you object to my sexual
(53:29) preferences hello really not at all go for the gold please don't discriminate against people who are dis begin not
(53:36) even with you Brian ableism that's very ableist of you to ladies he's screaming your name if you have missing two legs
(53:43) Brian wants you yeah I'll I'll accept one missing leg cuz I'm a nice guy yeah
(53:48) it's only because you'll be under fouret prer two i' prefer two missing but I'll do
(53:55) that's so she can't run away
(54:01) Ryan I couldn't help it I couldn't help he set me up for that one man good
(54:07) talk um wait so okay um now and right now you're not dating
(54:12) at all pretty much you're just kind of doing your own thing well like I said I've been like before you you reached out I was I I started like probably
(54:20) about a month prior I was like thinking about it realizing I feel like I'm ready but I've just been like dealing with a
(54:26) lot of other stuff and I've i' have other things that are higher priority to me and I'm really kind of subscribed to
(54:32) the belief that like what's meant to be will be and I'm not trying to force anything I'm not I'm not desperate for a
(54:39) relationship I would much rather be single and die alone than be in an unfulfilled unhappy or abusive
(54:45) relationship and so for me it's like the right person the right connection will come if it's meant to be and and I I
(54:52) feel like you have you've got Riz so like if thank you if you wanted to do
(54:58) you think you could like pretty quickly like get a new guy I know that if I didn't give a about the quality of
(55:04) the relationship I could had a boyfriend in 5 seconds in 5 seconds I I do and and people if you want to think I'm
(55:09) delusional no I mean not you just people people in general want to think I'm delusional I know that they're wrong and
(55:16) they live in a very like binary understanding of love and attraction and
(55:23) they're not willing to see things like outside of a different perspective so people who are like committed to
(55:29) misunderstanding me or the plus love experience I have no interest in debating the validity of my right to
(55:37) have love did you uh Rel after you're kind of you've had some viral moments recently did you get uh a lot of uh
(55:46) people dming you like with a romantic interest like they wanted to the DM not to sound cocky but that's that's that's
(55:52) something that continually happens and so I just don't take it seriously unless I think it's like cuz I have standards I
(55:59) have things that I want and things that are important to me and like attraction
(56:04) is important and and also just other certain things so I believe that both
(56:11) people should mutually be super excited to be together and if that's not there then I'm not interested I see and you
(56:17) mentioned uh you've got standards what do you consider yourself picky yes and no MH I feel like I just
(56:25) know what I want and I'm not going to settle for something that I find
(56:32) boring or uninteresting or not the right fit yeah and you mentioned you you kind
(56:37) of know what you're looking for you've got standards so I'm just curious like kind of what what are your standards
(56:43) what are you looking for and we're going to go around the table uh for everybody on this what are you looking for what
(56:48) are your standards if there's any like uh trying to think of the term here
(56:54) um uh mus haves you know some people have bare minimums you know height-wise income stuff like that
() 
(57:03) personality traits for me personality traits are the biggest for me it's like
(57:08) I want us to have SIM similar moral compasses okay um I you know I'm an ex
(57:14) Mormon so I'm not really interested in being with someone who's like super religious of any capacity because and
(57:21) like that's like I respect other people's beliefs but my lived experience
(57:26) I think that would be difficult for like a committed relationship so when you say moral compass you mean a lack of moral
(57:31) compass no I mean um I'm a very spiritual person and I have I didn't
(57:38) sorry I didn't mean it as an insult saying if you bring up you say this
(57:43) person X was hyper religious right so so you don't want that quality so if that's
(57:49) not the quality that you want then it seems like you're looking for an absence no of of okay so what what would be the
(57:56) morals you're talking about what I'm looking for is someone who has a moral compass that's driven by the desire to
(58:03) do good and be good without needing um someone telling them to be that way
(58:10) because you can be an atheist and be the most kind philanthropic person but that
(58:16) does not mean that you can be hyper religious and not be evil yeah I agree
(58:21) but does that mean you're looking for an atheist no um I mean just someone who's
(58:27) not hyper religious if they're Christian but they're not hyper religious I would be fine with that they were spiritual
(58:34) they were Jewish they were atheist ethnos when when you say this sorry to just kind of want to dive in on this a
(58:41) little bit when you say not hyper religious what does that mean like they don't go to church every Sunday FAL
(58:47) fanatical or I mean um if they went to church every Sunday but they weren't trying to convert me that'd be fine as
(58:54) long as I was wasn't forced to go to church like so to me it's just so you
(58:59) don't so what it is is you don't want a partner to uh move their morality towards you that's the or expect me to
(59:07) align with their religious beliefs because I believe or just beliefs and moralities do not have to be
(59:13) intrinsically tied even if they are for a lot of people okay so you're not looking really for a person who shares
(59:19) your morals but just a person who won't force their morals on you correct but I
(59:25) would want them to have a certain level of right but just like not a seral killer that type thing but I'm just not
(59:31) necessarily like boxing on like they they need to be Christian they need to be this they need to you know what about
(59:36) height height I mean I I have a preference but well how how tell you
(59:42) what's your prence I I prefer like you know I'm 56 so um six and up is like
(59:49) perfect but um I dated someone for a really long time who was 5'9 that was great for me okay um but yeah just a
(59:55) little bit taller than me is is like bare minimum preference but um I would date someone if everything else was
(1:00:02) perfect and they were shorter than me like being Short's not a deal breaker
(1:00:08) okay um far what about you what do you uh what you looking for um I don't care
(1:00:13) too much about height Builder physique I do want someone with super high sexual discipline so a guy who has a low body
(1:00:20) count preferably since I am waiting to marry and I'd prefer a guy or no this is a deal breaker I wouldn't dat a
(1:00:27) guy grid One Motorsports donated $200 when the only thing you can bring
(1:00:33) to a relationship is being fat selling your fatness online and ebbing on disability how much of a moral compass
(1:00:40) can you possibly have if you think my fatness is a
(1:00:48) negative quality that's not my problem I'm not here to please anybody I'm here
(1:00:54) to be me share my story I am employed I do a lot and I'm disabled and if you're
(1:01:01) disabled and unemployed that's okay too the bottom line is what I choose to do
(1:01:08) with myself and my interactions with other people defines who I
(1:01:14) am and I really just I am not interested in people who are committed and
(1:01:19) misunderstanding me yeah all right uh we'll come back to you far uh Al let's
(1:01:24) just uh just uh let's avoid any sort of name calling
(1:01:31) if we can with the uh chat and the uh TTS guys thank you go ahead yeah high sexual discipline um I went date a guy
(1:01:38) who watches porn or goes to strip clubs or anything like that and ideally wait you wouldn't dat a guy who watches porn
() 
(1:01:43) nope but you yep do o yep is that a seems like maybe a double
(1:01:49) standard is the double no it's not I could be a college professor but not date students I could work at a soup kitchen and not date a homeless guy just
(1:01:54) because I monetized off a demographic doesn't mean I have to date them well let's get into this little so let's
(1:02:00) start with why do you prefer that they not watch porn um because it affects
(1:02:05) parir bonding it desensitizes you to your partner it can lead to erectile dysfunction all those things if you were
(1:02:11) responsible for causing those things in a man would you be doing an immoral action um potentially and are you
(1:02:19) participating in doing those immoral actions to men no just because I think maybe you're less of a good romantic
(1:02:25) partner that doesn't mean you're less of a moral person because I don't think you would be a good husband for me doesn't mean I'm deeming you degenerate or a bad
(1:02:31) person you just said that all of those are bad qualities that you said that not
(1:02:37) objectively bad for me personally what I'm looking for finish me finish you
(1:02:43) said that any a person who was causing those problems in men would be doing something immoral no I didn't say that
(1:02:50) so is it if is if a person's contributing to causing that in men are they doing something immoral so if I'm a
(1:02:55) lesbian and I only want to date women don't ask me a question don't ask me a question answer my question no I'm
(1:03:00) giving I'm explaining to you just question L listen don't ask me is this inconsistent I'm going to ask you a
(1:03:06) question if I'm a lesbian and I only want to date women as soon as you answer my question content answer my question think she's
(1:03:13) trying to no she's asking me a question she's evading my point asking a question is not answering my question then I'll
(1:03:18) answer your question your question has no bearing on this discuss then answer it what was your question okay one more time since you everything to avoid it if
(1:03:26) you contribute to those same problems that is are against your preference in a mate okay those same issues are you
(1:03:33) doing something immoral nope no same way like I just said if I'm a lesbian who puts out pornographic content for men to
(1:03:39) consume it's not inconsistent or wrong for me to only date women I can have a preference for someone while monetizing
(1:03:45) off an entirely different demographic doesn't mean I'm doing something wrong so am I doing something wrong for
(1:03:50) indulging straight men I want to dat women I think you are I think a contribution towards the immorality and
(1:03:57) you know it's immoral because I don't think it's immoral to indulging heterosexuality personally being
(1:04:02) homosexual your preference alone is against it why is your preference against it isn't there why would sexual
(1:04:08) orientation be against it no answer my question why is it if I was a lesbian and I want to date women but I put out
(1:04:14) pornographic content that indulges heterosexual men is that inconsistent or am I contributing well all of that literally all of that would be immoral I
(1:04:21) would say that that's still an immoral thing whether or not you're being reason that you whether or not you're being
(1:04:26) inconsistent there I didn't make an inconsistency argument I asked you about whether or not it's moral you said if I
(1:04:31) don't want to date a certain pool that I'm contributing to does that mean I'm creating a problem no I'm just asking is it immoral for you to contribute to that
(1:04:38) at all no that's not it's not immoral for me to contribute to traits which I personally would not date no that's not
(1:04:45) my question my question is is it immoral for you to be contributing towards th
(1:04:50) those traits like um the negative side effects in men is that moral to do no because not everyone has the same goals
(1:04:56) as I do not everyone's waiting to have sex until they're married some people view sex and relationships completely disparately than I do so but why
(1:05:03) wouldn't you those are all negative side effects you'd agree with that right it depends some people I know a lot of women who don't want to get married I
(1:05:09) know a lot of men who don't want to get married either the side effects of like Ed things like this well that side effect doesn't happen to everybody
(1:05:15) either not saying it does I think it depends if certain men want to live a hedonistic lifestyle I'm not going to deem them immoral for I think people
(1:05:20) have totally different purposes goal it was and I answered it my question specifically was if you contribute
(1:05:26) towards that why would that's harmful isn't it and isn't that the standard you use for moral congruent to their goals
(1:05:32) if their goal is to be a hedonist then that's fine goal okay but here's the problem if their goal is to jack off to
(1:05:37) as many girls before they die they can go for it if if it's Hedonism right you still have a harm principle so even if a
(1:05:44) person is doing a thing and they say I'm going to do this thing because I don't care about the harm you are still
(1:05:50) supposed to care about the harm that you cause right no no you're not because
(1:05:56) they have a totally different moral rubric than I do if their goal is to  as many girls as possible because they think that makes them more alpha or
(1:06:01) M M who cares what their moral rubric is you're the consequentialist what so you are
(1:06:08) supposed to care about the harm you do I'm not a consequentialist we've been over this so many times oh what are you again I said I was a moral absolutist
(1:06:15) you're a moral absolutist yeah probably more that than a utilitarian why you shaking your head
() 
(1:06:20) you're not a subjective not you're not a absolu ridiculous say what is that um it
(1:06:27) means like you're not necessarily looking at the consequence of an action to deem its morality my point is people
(1:06:32) have totally different goals okay so is is porn always wrong no absolutely not okay is it always right no well not
(1:06:40) moral Absolut is you would if it was moral if it was a moral absolute it would either be always right or always
(1:06:46) wrong because it's AB okay give me an example of a moral absolute that's not yes or no right or wrong I would love to
(1:06:52) with porn for example porn will disaffect your relationship if one partner is okay with it and one is not that will affect cheating and
(1:06:58) compatibility if both partners are proponents of pornography consumption that'll actually increase your sexual intimacy with each other what does that
(1:07:04) have to do with anything I just said my point is you're looking for like a black or white answer it's point B it depends on the part think absolute
(1:07:14) means you don't know what absolute means I know what absolute meanss intentionally being OB now I
(1:07:20) think you're intentionally evading what do you think absolute means answer my question what do you think absolute
(1:07:25) means uh definite finite finite and definite at the same time sure at the
(1:07:31) same time that's what you think absolute means absolute means definite what do
(1:07:37) you think a moral absolutist is it means you have certain moral principles that you think take precedence over the
(1:07:43) consequences of those actions and you want to be a proponent for those moral principles even if there is an increase
(1:07:48) in harm over help okay so it's not about consequences what it's not about
(1:07:54) consequences for you at all it's not about consequences about looking at the fact that people have different aims if
(1:08:00) a certain man wants to prioritize his sexual pornography consumption over getting married because he personally
(1:08:06) doesn't think getting married is a net good for him who am I to say that's wrong and I'm contributing to a problem
(1:08:11) let me ask a single question right you would agree with me that the like age of
(1:08:16) consent arbitrary right would I agree with you that the age of is this to Brian no okay the AO the the AOC is
(1:08:25) arbitrary right is it arbitrary yeah um
(1:08:30) not really then give me the moral imperative for it real quick the moral
(1:08:35) absolute statement for that the moral imperative would be that it's generally wrong to um oh it's generally wrong it's
(1:08:43) not based on the consequence though what it's not based on the consequence this is an absolute so why should the AOC
(1:08:49) absolutely be xh it's not it VAR why should it be moral absolutist I don't even know if I
(1:08:56) would subscribe to that you wouldn't subscribe to your own worldview I don't even know if I would subscribe that
(1:09:01) there is a certain age of age of consent because it varies by state so you're not an absolutist then
(1:09:07) you're evading from my whole point you're not an absolutist you said that it's hypocritical and it's inconsistent and it's kind of immoral I'm
(1:09:12) contributing to a moral problem to put out por content his qu his question was whether or not there
(1:09:19) wasc a double standard I asked you about the morality of a thing yes and said I'm creating a problem by contributing to
(1:09:26) trades that I personally would not date now I'm inside of your worldview and now I'm trying to figure out the
(1:09:32) analogy I created between that and me being a lesbi to date women I'll but not wanting to date St time one time I can
(1:09:37) explain it because if the foundation of your worldview on it on its own is incorrect then I don't care about the
(1:09:43) rest of what you even just had to say if the foundation of what you're saying makes no sense at all any claims that
(1:09:50) you make past that are not even relevant so explain to me how you're moral tell me what a moral absolutist even is I
(1:09:57) don't even know what this has to do with anything your rebuttal to me was that because I don't want to date certain traits that I may contribute to that I'm
(1:10:03) being hypocritical and I'm creating some moral problem and then I give you a Perfect Analogy if I was a homosexual woman and I dated women but I contribute
(1:10:10) to indulging heterosexual male pornography consumption is that wrong and you have yet to address that point I don't need to why I'm going to explain
(1:10:17) it to you if the underlying foundation for which that current worldview you just explain stop talking my turn
(1:10:26) my Cal down stop stop sping and listen wait let's not use that word let's not use that probably probably to sperging
(1:10:33) is not against to is not no so he can so listen if you have a foundation for an
(1:10:39) ethical system and then you tell me a thing that you ought or ought not do and I find out that your ethical system
(1:10:44) itself is inconsistent you don't even know what it is why would I ever listen to a word you had to say about a because
(1:10:50) this is your chronic evasion of every point is when I give you a perfect anal and CC this will make you concede on
(1:10:55) your rebuttal then you're like oh now explain to me from a B to C your exact moral world view yeah why is that a
(1:11:02) problem to going go all the way backwards let's talk about where rights come from let's talk about where duties come from let's talk about obligation
(1:11:08) let's talk about the foundation of the things you believe is that crazy how is the universe started let's talk about that right what's your like go to all
(1:11:13) the time you going to answer to what a moral absolute are you going to answer my initial question which is why was
(1:11:19) that a false analogy between I'll just concede the whole argument there for the
(1:11:24) actually give me an answer you answering this question I just ConEd it for the purpose of the argument what's a moral Absol AR what's a moral Absolut no I
(1:11:32) just conceded it for the purpose of the argument stop saying for the purpose of the argument why not genuinely I can't I I'm sorry I
(1:11:40) can't test your consistency by conceding the argument just for the purpose of testing the worldview that's not okay
(1:11:46) you created a rebuttal and then I a perfect rebuttal and I'll just con it for the sake argument from just for the
(1:11:53) find every word in the dictionary for me enough for the sake of the argument I'm genuinely asking you why is it a false analogy I'm just conceding it for the
(1:12:00) sake of argument for the sake of the argument can we get back to what you because I need to know I'm not interested in talking abouted in talking
(1:12:06) about the foundations of your own ethical system ethical system we're talking about sexual and romantic preferences but why would I care what
(1:12:12) your preferences are if you can't give me any type of ID for why it's ethical or unethical so I should just never talk
(1:12:18) if I can't flesh out to you how the universe started never make an come from you should never make an claim unless
(1:12:24) you can say you ought to do this based on this let them go let them talk you cannot say Andrew you ought to do this
(1:12:31) and when I say why ought I do that you go I don't know cuz I just really feel like you you should so funny
(1:12:36) because you're the one who made the a claim I said I wouldn't date a guy who does watches porn and then you said uh
(1:12:41) then you ought not to contribute to that problem if you don't want to date a guy who watch I asked you if you should yes
(1:12:46) so you Creed the a claim I'm asking if you'd like to know if you'd
(1:12:52) like to know my worldview it's all totaly I hate it all I think it's all immoral what's AAL absolutist now can
(1:12:58) you answer the question my point was that doesn't mean I think it's morally wrong okay answer the question
(1:13:04) what's a moral absolutist a moral absolutist is someone who has certain moral principles that they think take priority over the consequences of those
(1:13:11) actions and they think those should be honored with precedence over the a utilitarian world view so why is it then
(1:13:18) that you're giving me an argument from the consequence how did I because you're saying
(1:13:25) AB Che thank you for the gift to 20 memberships go ahead Andrew you're saying okay so what you're saying here
(1:13:30) is I didn't even give you a consequence you say pornography not immoral
(1:13:36) right not necessarily yeah not necessarily but if we try to discover why it's not the reason that you say the
(1:13:43) reason it's not always immoral is because there's some consequences that I think are better than other consequences
(1:13:50) that's why even then it has nothing to do with morality it would for an absolutist if I prefer a partner who's
(1:13:57) 6' over 510 and I'm preferring the consequence of their height that doesn't mean I think 510 men are immoral unless
(1:14:04) or there's something morally wrong with being short you wouldn't say I'm a moral absolutist I believe that this x thing
(1:14:10) is absolutely always immoral except asking why why are we conflating romantic preferences with a moral rubric
(1:14:17) same way if I said because it's an not claim no it's not yeah it is same way if I said I prefer a tall guy over short
(1:14:23) guy that's not me saying oh then you know it's bad for me to contribute to something that decreases height in men
(1:14:29) yeah but that would be a preference in this particular occasion I'm talking about a preference I'm asking you about the morality talking about preference
(1:14:35) same way again if I could be indulging being a lesbian we go back and for okay fine so we'll just do you think
(1:14:42) it's moral because your preferences and I think it's moral because my preferences but you're a moral Absolut I didn't say moral I literally said
(1:14:47) morality has no bearing on my romantic preferences in this instance you're the one bringing up morality for no reason
(1:14:54) I like a certain race or a certain height and that doesn't mean I'm claiming all other men are immoral far
(1:15:00) if I prer wom am I calling men immoral If all we're talking about is I like water and you like lemons right then why
(1:15:08) if we're making the discussion about these things which are going on uh inside of uh consistency issues things
(1:15:14) like this like like he was talking about or you claiming you're a moral absolutist things like this we're now
(1:15:19) outside the realm of preference we're now into the realm of far as worldview so I'm trying to figure romantic
(1:15:26) preferences and I'm saying why does romantic preferences even fall within the worldview of morality because what if you're romantic if I prefer a guy
(1:15:32) with a big dick over a small dick does that mean I think guys with small dicks areal I'll tell you because what if you're what if you're you indulge in
(1:15:39) your preferences and they're actually against your own morality then are you doing something immoral by following
(1:15:44) that preference right and I'm saying I'm not deeming those guys who watch porner go to strip clubs immoral I'm saying for what I'm seeking in a romantic
(1:15:50) relationship those are not traits that would be preferable to my go they're not immoral and I'm trying to to show you
(1:15:56) that I think you think that either a you're right and they're not immoral and
(1:16:01) you're a consequentialist or you think I don't think it's immoral I would be friends with guys who watch porn if I actually thought it was immoral and I
(1:16:07) thought it was like akin to an actual moral wrongdoing like murder or the r word then I wouldn't be friends with those people I wouldn't be friends with
(1:16:13) girls and guys who watch porner go to the strip clubs how do you determine whether something's morally positive or
(1:16:19) negative it it would be a case by case I can't flush out a perfect moral based on the consequences of that asking
(1:16:26) you what does morality have to do with a romantic preference hang listen that's a bait and switch it's not question you always do
(1:16:33) the same thing when I ask you a question you answer with a question what he asked you specifically is how do you know
(1:16:40) something you're doing is moral or immoral I don't know I don't I don't have a pure moral framework at this time
(1:16:46) so you're not a moral absolutist no I said I probably sub you go you're consequentialist you're a
(1:16:52) consequentialist okay you took you took murder and you took you take all of these other things based on the
(1:16:57) consequences of what happens in that scenario so murder just I'm pretty sure moral
(1:17:04) absolutism against murder just let them finish so if you commit murder the consequence is negative because you take
(1:17:10) someone's life you take human life so that's a consequence so you're looking at the consequence and you determine
(1:17:15) it's bad you don't take you're not pulling from objective standard you're taking your interpretation of the
(1:17:21) consequence and then conflating that with negativity if you think moral absolutists would object to murder you're deranged then tell us what your
(1:17:28) standard is for why someone should be against murder that doesn't fit the consequen for your standard of what your
(1:17:35) morality is based on I don't even know why we're talking about morality I know that you don't know but now using this as an evasion because you want to on the
(1:17:41) point what you're actually saying you're not saying I don't know why we're we're talking about morality you're saying I don't know the answer to your
(1:17:47) question yeah I don't have an answer for what is your perfect moral framework write aook moral framework based on
(1:17:53) something you don't even know don't even know yeah you don't even know WR 300 pages to flesh out their morality they
(1:17:58) can't give you a two sentence quip on the whatever podcast no the you say you say the foundation no because if I asked
(1:18:04) you you'd probably say like oh I subscribe to Christianity but then you probably have some exceptions to that and you could maybe flesh those out by
(1:18:11) giving me an internal critique which I'm fine with because I follow Christian ethics which is exactly what I'm doing to you this romantic so you just told me
(1:18:18) you said I have a worldview I can't justify my worldview I don't even know how I came to the world view I don't even know what my standard is for
(1:18:24) Morality but this thing over here that's not immoral what the are you talking about I'm saying how does
(1:18:29) morality can you explain to me why morality even pertains to this conversation of romantic preferences because if we're talking
(1:18:35) about pornography we're coming at it from two different standards I'm saying that the standard is immoral you're saying the standard is moral I'm saying
(1:18:41) I'm going to justify my morality you say you can't justify your morality I want people to listen to the guy who can justify the morality and not to the to
(1:18:48) the person who absolutely here's my two sentence cute little answer I think generally people should aim to self-actualize and genuinely they should
(1:18:55) like seek to fulfill their autonomy so if someone has a certain goal for thems that generally is not harming someone
(1:19:00) else and for instance like they want to  as many people as possible selfe mean um you know live up to their
(1:19:06) potential I don't know if that's congruent with a Christian framework I don't even know what that means all this is consequence-based It's dependent upon
(1:19:12) the outcome that's not true it is though is consequentialist based I think you
(1:19:18) can self-actualize and maybe have nothing to show for at the end of the day but I think a absolutist was effort and the intention that's literally with
(1:19:24) an Absolut if you're just saying you're just saying you're just talking about the the uh
(1:19:30) absence of negative outcomes so I mean it is consequentialism consequentialist just because it also happens to overlap
(1:19:36) with consequentialism I'm asking for the standard and you're just giving us preferences why is it that my romantic
(1:19:41) preference has anything to do morality or why is it inconsistent I know it sounds bad to say I do o but I went date a guy who does X Y and Z but genuinely
(1:19:48) flush it out because right now it just sounds like you guys have a unjustified visceral reaction to the fact that I sound like a hypocrite you can actually
(1:19:53) flush it out okay so let me flush it out for you one more time flush it out without just asking oh right give me a two second moral framework I'm not even
(1:19:59) going to ask you a question I'm just literally going to flush it out for you if I ask you why you wee a blue shirt over red and then you said I just prefer
(1:20:05) blue I say it's immoral to then why is mine not a prence you would have to make a justification for that unless unless
(1:20:11) you're saying that your entire moral framework is just a preference so if you were to say I look better in a blue shirt than a red shirt and I were to say
(1:20:18) oh then you're selfishly motivated why are you only interested in what you like maybe you should survey the panel
(1:20:23) find out like what we prefer looking the one who's going to have to stare at you for 4 hours but wouldn't you say that's kind of a weird rebuttal to why you
(1:20:29) chose a blue shirt over is that your argument I'm showing you how ridiculous sound no my argument is not ridiculous
(1:20:34) what you're say completely ridiculous then stop talking let me make my argument what you're saying is just a sequence of preferences you're saying
(1:20:40) Andrew why did your preference to do this thing which you have a preference to do that nobody considers immoral
(1:20:45) including you and I why did you do that thing I say well because it's a preference you go oh okay makes sense
(1:20:50) it's a preference all you're giving us right this second for the entire standard for your entire morality is
(1:20:56) your preference not morality I'm saying my romantic stands are why you chose a
(1:21:02) over another almost done you let these male guests blow V but if I talk for more than two seconds seriously she been
(1:21:09) it's so unfair disrespectfully always stops her for you and never stops you guys for her ever well because this is
(1:21:16) with the male audience okay I'm sorry you know what far I know I was just about to lay the entire groundwork for
(1:21:21) my epistemology you don't have any but you go ahead I'll I'll chill out having rebuttal to I was saying the
(1:21:29) fact that he will always cut me off after two sentences but let any male guest on this panel blate for like 3 minutes plus even if it's not related to
(1:21:36) the conversation and I can never do that hit a fight with you no no no I I equally I I make Fair attempts to let
(1:21:43) everybody speak you know I'm a I'm a I will pay someone to comb through this and create a chart of how much you you
(1:21:48) go ahead you go ahead I was talking about dating preference I'm so lost but
(1:21:54) he knows that he can't let it slide if I'm an O girl and I I went watch like date a guy who watches porn so he has to now try to dunk on the even though it
(1:22:01) doesn't pertain to ethics let's continue let's continue on so if Andrew is making a point how does it not pro you got so
(1:22:08) angry how does it not how how does it not pertain to I'm chilling how does it
(1:22:14) not pertain to ethics if you tell me that you're doing something that's unethical it's like this you I say did I say unethical i w my initial answer did
(1:22:20) I say I would because watching porn is une arent is what your argument is you go to me and you're like hey Andrew I'm
(1:22:26) about to go commit murder and then I go wait you can't do that and here's why and you're like uh I didn't want to have
(1:22:31) a conversation about my ethical standards I just wanted to tell you that I was going to go commit murder that's your argument right now Farah it's not
(1:22:38) my argument is exactly akin to saying maybe I would wear a blue shirt over a red one and I'm saying it's a preference
(1:22:45) no I'm saying from my standpoint you doing only fans is immoral you agree that that's true but that wasn't even the argument if you want to discuss the
(1:22:50) morality of sex work I'd love to get say you're on only fans yes but that wasn't you're rebuttal to me you're rebuttal to
(1:22:56) me was that I'm contributing to something wrong while not preferring it a partner but the reason I wouldn't prefer those tra in a partner it's not
(1:23:01) because I think tell because it would create a partner that wouldn't be as pair bonded to me that was the whole
(1:23:06) point and what did I tell you the point was of me saying wait a second you're
(1:23:12) contributing to X Thing by being on only fans right yes I am contributing to X
(1:23:17) thing that doesn't make X thing immoral because I would date or so now we can get into why X thing is immoral let's do
(1:23:22) it but then concede that that doesn't mean I was calling tting literally told you for the purpose of the argument I'll
(1:23:28) con Pur the argument like why won't you let it move on because you didn't even addess you were wrong you created a
(1:23:34) rebuttal to what I was saying and then completely switch the top I'm still trying to get into the ethics of this thing but we can get to the ethics of
(1:23:40) are your eics just preference just a preference is it just a preference is what a preference is your the fact that
(1:23:46) you say that only fans is moral the fact that you say like apparently I guess prostitution is moral when did we say
(1:23:52) moral stop stop car I just let you talk right so are you saying that only fans
(1:23:58) you you're making the claim only fans moral right no I did not say that and I
(1:24:04) know you know I didn't say that I literally said we can discuss the morality of it I was saying there immoral immoral as a moral absolutist is
(1:24:11) it immoral I'm Sor is there no such thing as moral neutrality such as you wearing a flannel versus him wearing a leather jacket versus him wearing a
(1:24:16) hoodie yes you can say moral neut it's morally neutral I'm fine with that too I would say it's morally neutral it's
(1:24:22) morally neutral well it depends Case by case is it absolutely morally neutral no that's why I said Case by case are you
(1:24:29) absolutely sure same way I could probably find a way to say maybe you wearing these certain shirts aren't exactly morally neutral because maybe a
(1:24:35) child sewed that shirt and we can get into it Case by case but generally I can say it's morally neutral for you to have different shirts that you're wearing is
(1:24:40) that fair sure it's morally neutral for me to have okay for me to ask you to justify the morality of your shirt so
(1:24:45) hang on so only fans to you is just like me wearing a shirt it's m Case by case same way exactly I don't know maybe if
(1:24:52) you have four-year-old make that shirt for you today then we can get so we go into it's a case by case so inside on
(1:24:58) the model the consumer the Rel so inside of only fans how would you evaluate
(1:25:04) absent bad consequences the things inside of only fans that you would consider moral or immoral um probably
(1:25:12) the ethics of sex work so typical things like whether the model is being groomed into it whether the consumer
(1:25:18) consquence next um whether the consumer is honest with his romantic partner
(1:25:23) about it that's not consequence then why would you value why would you value it absent negative consequence I think uh
(1:25:29) if you're looking at something like dishonesty and integrity that if anything that pertains more to moral absolutism than it does consequentialism
(1:25:35) because if the partner doesn't find out then technically that's fine by consequentialism because maybe he got to jack off to a model and keep his
(1:25:41) relationship going but I would still say that's wrong even though he's lying to his wife about it's okay to tell a lie if it saves a life what can you tell a
(1:25:49) li if it saves a life um I think it depends it depends on the
(1:25:55) consequences for it what no no it depends on the LIE
(1:26:01) itself and the severity of the LIE related from consequence you know you're pivoting you know I'm not I'm this is
(1:26:07) literally to your point I'm testing your logic so my logic is to say I think you're consequentialist I think all the things you just named are
(1:26:12) consequence-based for negative outcomes no it's literally not literally is and
(1:26:17) this is how I can demonstrate it for you can you moderate a little bit this is how I can demonstrate it for I'm more of a free flow
(1:26:22) yeah this is are you playing solit this is how I can demonstrate it Sol this is how I can demonstrate it I know you just
(1:26:28) want to CH the topic wait okay here let's let far thank you so much it's not
(1:26:33) like I two hours for this okay anyways iqu I flew too okay um it's not
(1:26:40) consequentialist because I was literally saying even if that man who's watching the of content is lying to his wife but
(1:26:45) it improves the status of his relationship because now he's more likely to have sexual intimacy with his wife but he knows that he's
(1:26:51) transgressing his wife sexual boundary I still think that's wrong so that's 100% no it's not no it's not because that's
(1:26:58) increasing the pleasure in his relationship that's moral absolutism literally because I'm still saying
(1:27:04) that's a wrong deed if it was reversed but if it was reversed if it's reversed then that completely changes the situation right now because the
(1:27:10) consequences reversed the consequences changed to on purpose I literally said
(1:27:15) even if it's a net good in terms of pleasure because maybe his wife is now enjoying him more she's like wow my husband's so happy lately and jolly
(1:27:22) cheery and he's more happy lately maybe now he can actually last longer in bed if he's transgressing her boundary I
(1:27:28) still think it's wrong to lie about being subscribed to an O um because I'm you know prioritizing honesty Integrity
(1:27:34) you know honoring your vows over a consequentialist humanism yeah why why I
(1:27:39) I think that's the I I think that's the end the dead end of moral absolutism is I'm valuing honesty and integrity yeah
(1:27:45) why why cuz I think those are good traits I have a question so their preferences so the eny of far's
(1:27:53) worldview what are you talking about listen I'm going to explain yeah just so this is really simple really very simple
(1:28:00) what you say is this you say you say it bottoms out at moral absolute on truth
(1:28:06) and on this and on that things which Justice Integrity hon you prefer that is the weirdest evasion I've
(1:28:13) ever heard in my life no no it's not the weirdest evasion because ultimately what he's trying to get to is saying that you
(1:28:19) are the one who's determining whether it's more imal it's a preference a preference that doesn't make it
(1:28:25) consequentialist it does in this case because all of the things in which you value are seem to be based around the
(1:28:32) consequences I literally said it's not even if it improves their relationship and makes it so that they don't get divorced and they have a happier
(1:28:38) marriage I still think it's wrong to transgress someone's boundary fair enough so then what we could say instead is this maybe you're right and it's not
(1:28:44) that you always value the consequence we would just say that the entirety of far's entire moral system comes from her
(1:28:51) preferences how is that a preference because you said that moral absolutism
(1:28:56) bottoms out at truth and at these other values that you have which you have a preference for which I think most people
(1:29:03) have a preference for the legal system the courts most Moral Majority think that's politicians so the most people
(1:29:09) determine morality then what most most people I said specifically the institutions which we've entrusted our
(1:29:15) Justice and our legal systems with has nothing to do with most people if anything that's proba dep the majority of people belie I
(1:29:22) didn't say majority I literally said I could be a minority but we can like look at the syllogisms of why they've arrived at this conclusion of why this good
(1:29:29) thing I just love that we've detoured so much cuz this proves my point that it's not inconsistent for me to do only
() 
(1:29:35) because you've had to detour like 30 times now why is why is it important that she determines the morality of men
(1:29:41) that she wouldn't consider dating that's what I don't understand about the entire premise of this conversation the audience her
(1:29:48) responsibility to determine the morality of the men that she wouldn't consider dating consuming the content that they
(1:29:54) would consume regardless of how they got it is a consenting person creating the content she runs her own business she's
(1:30:01) eth ethically creating her own her own content why is it ethical because she's consenting to the creation of her
(1:30:07) content why is that ethical because that is less consumption
(1:30:14) happening of content that people are not consenting to making yeah but you just are repeating it right the consent is
(1:30:19) what makes it ethical the problem is to me I'm trying to do what I'm trying to do is get to the foundation of why you
(1:30:25) think things are ethical or unethical that's the point why do you think things are ethical or unethical
(1:30:32) why based on I mean that depends on the conversation no why do you think things
(1:30:37) are good or bad I mean I don't do that off of any religious
(1:30:43) aspect good andad usually we do positive and negative B so basically like the the
(1:30:48) Do no harm so you think that things are bad if if they're harmful and harmful or
(1:30:54) subjective that's your that's your principle yes harm harmful is subjective but uh for me I make that determination
(1:31:03) based on my lived experience okay so what you're trying to avoid then this is the principle we're just trying to get
(1:31:09) at which far evaded a million times is that for you you're just looking at things through the Outlook of you don't
(1:31:16) want there to be harm caused correct and there's but and then of course with any
(1:31:21) ision in any business there are risks and like of harm Factor you know you can
(1:31:27) be a CEO making $100,000 a year doing Beyond unethical damage to the
(1:31:34) environment to the society at large to several factors and not using sex to do
(1:31:40) so so her doing that there is no ethical consumption under under capitalism and
(1:31:47) there is no ethical there's no ethical consumption under capitalism correct there is no ethical because because that
(1:31:53) well that would mean that capitalism always does harm right not always well then it can't be no then it can't be no
(1:31:59) you can't say there can be no ethical consumption and then say but except for
(1:32:05) the Times there can be well they both exist so there are things that can be
(1:32:10) ethical and things that can't be but you cannot experience consumption without
(1:32:17) there being unethical unethical unethical excuse me aspects that are out outside of our control as an individual
(1:32:23) and those are immoral okay right I mean dependent yeah dependent on what if it
(1:32:30) causes harm it's immoral right yes but it I lost what it was so then every
(1:32:37) single time somebody does something which is harmful it's immoral we've established that and you said that
(1:32:43) there's no chance they can never be ethical consumption ever not even one case inside of capitalism that means
(1:32:49) capitalism is always harmful right see you're you're you're trying to boil
(1:32:55) it down to white and black thinking and that's just not yeah it is the line to go down subjective also wait are we
(1:33:02) talking about commun you can't be subjective you can't be subjective if you say we could we could talk no but see the sex is a commodification of sex
(1:33:11) that is a part of capitalism that was the the point from which I was deriving from what was the point you what that
(1:33:18) that you that you that sex work is the con is the commodification of sex uhhuh
(1:33:25) the commodification aspect is what I was aligning with capitalism and making that statement so then sex work is is immoral
(1:33:32) under capitalism I don't understand that line
(1:33:39) of logic you just said that it it's sex Works a commodification under capitalism and any type of transaction under
(1:33:46) capitalism is exclusive to capitalism so therefore not exclusive to capitalism say all I asked you was so sex work in
(1:33:53) capitalism is always immoral no no no so then all things which are commodified
(1:33:59) and transactions made Capital I'm on the side here you don't I don't moralize sex
(1:34:04) work it's it's a so then there are transactions under a capitalist society which are
(1:34:10) moral yeah okay but then then why did you say that there can be no ethical
(1:34:15) transactions ever under communism or under capitalism no you said that no I
(1:34:20) did not okay go ahead and repeat your spiel about communism again capitalism
(1:34:26) capitalism sorry there can be no what under capitalism there there maybe there's a better way of phrasing it say
(1:34:33) what did you say my what the exact phrase I believe is there there is no
(1:34:38) eth like when you're saying it's a simplified phrase you're trying to there
(1:34:44) is no ethical con conception under capitalism that is what I said so then only fans under capitalism is unethical
(1:34:50) or morally neutral which keep forgetting exhaust but she can't she said all all transactions under capitalism are
(1:34:55) unethical all of them every one of them she didn't say unethical she said no ethical consumption that's the Le are
(1:35:00) you consuming are you consuming only fans ethal are you consuming only fans she said it was commodified she said
(1:35:07) it's commodified so if somebody's consuming only fans by her logic has to be unethical she didn't say unethical she said no ethical consumption it could
(1:35:14) be morally neutral if so so then if somebody's consuming only fans that would be unethical or ethically neutral
(1:35:20) they can't be ethically neutral if she says every single time is she say no ethical not unethical those are two
(1:35:26) different things yes so it's so everything under your worldview then
(1:35:32) when it comes to capitalism is either immoral or morally neutral there's no moral Goods I'm sorry please repeat that
(1:35:38) question I want to make sure I understood that under capitalism MH can you do
(1:35:44) anything that is a moral good I mean yes because it's I don't I
(1:35:50) don't go into the absolutes then now right are you still going to make the claim far
(1:35:57) now that she said yes you can at least do positive things right she she did say
(1:36:04) that under her ethical system repeat it again I just want to make sure I get it right so that I'm not strawmanning you
(1:36:09) about the the capitalism quote um there is no ethical conception under cap or no that's what you said there is no ethical
(1:36:15) concept that's what you said the first time and I may have misquoted the phrasing I that's honestly I'm dyslexic
(1:36:22) so honestly I could have misquoted what I meant to say so yeah so that's very plausible their
(1:36:28) point good talk dating podcast by the way um right got into economics I think
(1:36:34) we're going around saying our preferences preferences that was about thank thank you far uh yeah so uh
(1:36:42) preferences you finish did you finish oh did oh well you sure you want to you want to finish I would love to have her
(1:36:48) finish just to be curious not to have someone rebut off of her preference thank you so much yeah I think I pretty
(1:36:55) much detailed it already I would like someone intelligent someone who doesn't watch porn doesn't go to strip clubs and
() 
(1:37:00) has super high sexual discipline well that's morally um uh is
(1:37:06) my turn now y okay um fun um I think
(1:37:11) that I'm probably also looking for someone who's got Sim similar spiritual beliefs as me which are um I'm I'm
(1:37:18) spiritual I was raised Catholic but I grew away from uh I grew away from
(1:37:23) religion just learning a lot of things and experiencing things um so someone who wasn't super locked into um she
(1:37:30) mentioned hyper religious people here don't love that term um I don't mind that um but I don't want that either um
(1:37:38) I wouldn't actually yeah yeah and you said that you want an athletic guy do you want a tall guy I like someone I
(1:37:43) would like someone who likes to be athletic yeah like um I mean ideally it'd be nicer for them to be I like to
(1:37:49) wear heels a lot okay so normally like tell you I'm five I'm 5'7 5'8 if I'm
(1:37:54) doing Runway and so bare minimum height for a guy um my first boyfriend was
(1:38:00) probably 5'7 but after that um it's been like 6 feet 5'11 510 okay so would you say bare minimum
(1:38:07) is like 5'10 um ideally yeah 510 and taller like when I'm looking I'm like
(1:38:12) okay yeah especially on dating sites because there's more yeah to view and I can be a little bit more specific I'll
(1:38:18) be like okay yeah and you prefer like uh uh guys with large pin it sounded like
(1:38:24) um that was a preference they prefer me but yeah I'm not mad they prefer you okay all right there's like a mutual
(1:38:31) understanding there yeah what about you um for me I think I would like want
(1:38:38) someone that cuz I don't go out like I don't go out to clubs that's not like my thing I get like anxious and stuff but I
(1:38:46) would want someone that would want to go out like to the movies or to do arcades or something like that like okay so like
(1:38:53) dates and stuff yeah but also something serious because I know a lot of people
(1:38:59) like on dating apps um they say oh let's hang out and this and that but they
(1:39:04) don't want to hang out they just want to hang out to like have sex yeah basically
(1:39:09) and like I'm not trying to wait when's the last time you went to the club I don't go oh you don't go at all no like
(1:39:14) the last time I went was a couple months ago but that's cuz my friend invited me but I don't usually go out like okay
(1:39:22) it's not my okay area um Madison I guess my preferences
(1:39:30) are someone who is very committed honest loyal in a relationship I feel like um
(1:39:37) they have all my attention so I want to have their attention as well and I don't
(1:39:43) really like when people cheat doesn't mean my preference is for you not to cheat doesn't mean I'm going to
(1:39:50) contribute to cheat cheating as well um but yeah um I prefer I prefer a cute face
(1:39:57) nice wasted hip ratio um emotionally stable I can't do to highly neurotic women um they crazy I like I like this
(1:40:06) sweet innocent in introverted types um high in conscientiousness I like a dutiful woman okay yeah Mason yeah um so
(1:40:15) she has to be a Christian um and not just by not just by name name um they
(1:40:22) actually have to live that out and what that looks like is she has to U subscribe to what the Bible says um is
(1:40:29) that a Chino huh a Chino a Chino like a rhino but a like Christian in name
(1:40:37) only you know like Republican and name yeah got yeah I mean a lot of people
(1:40:43) will claim Christ but not live like it um yeah so I think uh there will be as
(1:40:50) Jesus said there will be many on that day that say Lord Lord did we not do all these things in your name and he said
(1:40:55) depart from me uh you practice law lawlessness and uh I never knew you so
(1:41:01) it's but it's somebody who loves the Lord subscribes to what he says and
(1:41:07) practices that um so that's got to be there um other than that uh she's got to
(1:41:14) be active she wants she's got to be uh marriage-minded um so not sleeping
(1:41:20) around I want her to save herself from marriage if she had a past I can work with that uh Brian doesn't want me to uh
(1:41:28) to uh lower my standards for that but yeah I his um I am your Eternal wingman
() 
(1:41:34) Mason exactly there's some women who've previously attempted to convince you to
(1:41:40) uh you know date women who might not also be virgins exactly might they might be
(1:41:47) prostitutes even that was a stretch I feel like but but Mason Brian is my
(1:41:53) gatekeeper I am any women out there you want to get to Mason you got to come through
(1:41:58) me yeah not like you don't have to like sleep in the room sound could come off a
(1:42:04) weird just like that seems counterproductive that would that would be just a little counterproductive you know very counterproductive for Mason
(1:42:11) but Mason but you if Mason if you even come to me you come to me with a woman who's not a virgin I got I'm going to
(1:42:18) you're going to sabotage it I'm going to clam block or is that I don't know what the term is oh
(1:42:25) boy but yeah I I want her to be like I want her to desire to be a mother I want to have a large family so she's got to
(1:42:31) have a similar desire things he's some good things um yeah I want her to uh

(1:42:42) I I need someone with I need somebody that actually has a like a basis for
(1:42:47) their moral standard okay yeah sorry far can't just be a preference you made out
(1:42:53) it's got there's got to be some basis uh but yeah yeah so I want someone to be able to build a home got to build a home

(1:43:35) looking for somebody who had um wait isn't a unicorn um a lesbian that's added into a couple or a virgin I think
(1:43:43) I just learned that oh or it could be a mythical rare creature which one do you think I was refin we have
(1:43:49) toize creat right so anyway I mean I really didn't know I don't know you I don't yeah I get it I
(1:43:56) get it I just think yeah anyway um so for me my preference for a woman was
(1:44:02) somebody who prioritized Duty over herself and that's what the Unicorn part
(1:44:07) is I have in most of my experience with women is that they do not prioritize
() 
(1:44:13) Duty over their own self-interest Consciousness oh yeah what is Duty it
(1:44:18) would be a level of resp responsibility uh that you would move towards over whatever your personal
(1:44:25) preferences were interesting and you haven't been able to find women who do that feel like that's us other than my
(1:44:32) wife my wife has always prioritized Duty over her own preferences and what it is
(1:44:37) that she wants and if we were to really get into it right like you might
(1:44:43) disagree with what I'm saying but if you want to get into it I can explain to you and probably reduce for you How likely
(1:44:49) in your situ situation you don't really believe in Duty or responsibility but most of your preferences just revolve
(1:44:56) around your sense of self and what it is that you want I wouldn't argue with that I'm single um but that's not how I function in a relationship well what are
(1:45:02) your duties in a relationship I guess it would depend on who my man is and what he's expecting I would really like to
(1:45:08) get to know him and get to know what are the things that make him happy but in general I really like um you were
(1:45:13) talking about I really like to cook for my man like to have him a place that you know he likes to come home to love to be
(1:45:18) like a space that could lift him up and lighten him if he's going through a hard time be that person he can talk to and
(1:45:25) encourage him um rub him down you know if he wants breakfast 3: a.m. and we're tired I'm still going to do those kinds
(1:45:31) of things that's what I see and then I guess if he's got any particular things he wants and that something that's feasible for me and I love him I'm going
(1:45:37) to try to do it yeah yeah what about things that he might want you to do that you don't want to do yeah we try
(1:45:43) everything once yeah well no I'm not talking about sexually I'm not either yeah yeah so so out in the world so
(1:45:50) let's just assume for a second that he tells you that he wants you to stop talking to your mother because it's
(1:45:55) causing a serious issue inside of your relationship yeah uh and you think that
(1:46:01) you talking to your mother is not causing a serious relationship or or an issue in your relationship would you
(1:46:07) defer to him are we married yeah I'm deferring to him he's my husband okay always it's my husband I mean hopefully
(1:46:13) we're at the place where if I am his wife we have a common understanding of communication where we respect each
(1:46:18) other but yeah I mean he's the leader of the House okay and why do you think he's the leader of the house he got the oh um
(1:46:24) hopefully because he's providing and protecting so what if he wasn't providing I wouldn't be in that
(1:46:30) situation so I can't I can't um well you could be where you're with a man who could provide okay but hang on just hear
(1:46:36) me out okay so he's providing for you for a few years and then he's in a situation where through whatever means
(1:46:42) he can't provide for you anymore yes you would not put yourself in that situation no I mean I'm already in that once I'm
(1:46:48) married I to do what I can do do to keep that together yeah okay but if what if he couldn't provide for you anymore okay
(1:46:55) would you still stay with him I would not be with a man who doesn't have the motivation to pick up so if yeah he fell
(1:47:00) off for a little bit I'm going to be right there to pick him up in any way um knowing that it's not going to be like
(1:47:07) that forever because at the end of the day I'm hoping to be able to carry children and um I won't be able to do
(1:47:12) both provide and carry children yeah but what if he's maimed and he can't he's maed and he can't I guess it will handle
(1:47:17) that when it happens yeah but if he was if he was maed and he could would you prioritize him over you I mean
(1:47:23) I'd be taken care of him he where's heed sickness on yeah so he's I'm say what
(1:47:29) I'm saying is is that he's maed in a way where he can no longer provide for you yeah that's the man if I love him like
(1:47:35) obviously I love to the soul so it wasn't about the physical which is why he was trying to point out like this but for me it's it there's more there's more
(1:47:42) okay so you would stay with him even if he couldn't provide for you yeah I mean here's the thing though I'm going to be honest with you if if it was a situation
(1:47:48) where um it changed who he was and I do mean I mean
(1:47:54) like sometimes people will go through catastrophic events and who they are as
(1:47:59) a person completely changes and I feel like there's definitely an amount of time that I would give to help that
(1:48:05) person but if it event if it in eventually came back to something that
(1:48:12) um would destroy me um I've been in situations where I did let it destroy me
(1:48:17) I hope that I've grown right now to attract someone who wouldn't so your greater duties to yourself
(1:48:23) um I guess I would I depend on the situation well in this situation you just your greater duties is to you if it
(1:48:30) was something that was to destroy me I don't know cuz I just told you that I've LED it destroy me in the past so I mean
(1:48:36) I'd like to think that I've grown out of that but maybe not but you just got done saying to me to be perfectly honest with
(1:48:41) you if I knew that this was something that was going to destroy me correct you're going to exit the situation right
(1:48:47) and I also just stated to you that in the past when I thought that I might have done that I still let it destroy me so I'm hoping that yes I would make that
(1:48:54) choice but given given my past exam my past um history that's not something that I would when it destroyed you in
(1:49:00) the past did you leave the situation um he got another girl
(1:49:05) pregnant did you leave the situation I mean it was at that point I'm the girl's calling me and she's I mean I didn't
(1:49:11) have a choice that's yeah I all the qualifi I'm just asking you left the situation though I I didn't have a
(1:49:17) choice right so based on the pattern of um destroy is like your wife would you
(1:49:24) you leave her you cheat on her and she's still going to be like I'm down I'm saying that your wife's greatest
(1:49:30) priority as far as her Duty goes is obeyence to her husband and taking care
(1:49:37) of her children and taking care of her family is the priority so your point right now is to prove that I'm not I would not be Duty I would not no it's
(1:49:44) not I'm not saying that you wouldn't be dutiful that's not really what my preference here is what I'm saying is
(1:49:49) that the thing I look for is in a woman is somebody who has a greater duty to me
(1:49:57) than to her and I that's why I think it's a unicorn I agree I I think that the way that you know that is by being
(1:50:03) shown it not by asking I don't know what that means what do you mean I think that was pretty
(1:50:08) self-explanatory the reason why you know that is because she's shown you that she's beautiful you're asking me if I
(1:50:14) would be dutiful those are two different things I can sit there and say one thing or the other but my actions speak for me
(1:50:19) okay that's fair so I mean within the the confines of the point though I guess I'm just trying to kind of flesh out
(1:50:25) that that's what I'm after as a woman who prioritizes Duty over self and to me
(1:50:31) there's just almost none of them who who do that I feel like a lot of women I know that is our biggest problem is we
(1:50:37) put you guys before ourselves and so it's interesting that you say that and it's te their own but that's what I feel
(1:50:43) like I've encountered a lot with my how are they putting I don't know I think uh I mean
(1:50:48) if you take just divorce sta statistics um and the amount of like just cause
(1:50:55) divorce as opposed to no cause divorces so just like preference like this person
(1:51:01) is not making me happy the vast majority of divorces are happening by women because they're just not happy anymore
(1:51:07) lack of commit it's lack of commitment so it's I mean I I would say that the
(1:51:14) evidence suggests otherwise that most women don't want to be in a relationship
(1:51:19) because they're not happy and it's they would rather prioritize their happiness
(1:51:24) over the health and uh the health and growth of their
(1:51:30) family their happiness contribute to the health and happiness of the family hold on and to
(1:51:35) speak to his point you also said earlier somebody who treats you like a princess that tells you that's that's
(1:51:42) what Andrew is referring to what is it cuz I didn't specify what that means so what do youan you you didn't and I wanted to ask you what that meant but
(1:51:47) that statement in itself somebody who treats treats me like a princess as opposed to you saying a guy
(1:51:54) that I want to be a wife for or oh yeah that was just a short and sweet thing I didn't get to delve into anything
(1:51:59) specific yes okay but that's what that's what he that's what he's talking about though with the dutifulness and then with women talking about themselves like
(1:52:05) that statement is a a selfish statement it's self the statement is selfish but it wasn't neglecting it's like saying
(1:52:11) like Oh Black lives matter to me no no other matters no other things matter it's like no I wasn't stating that I wouldn't treat someone like a king it's
(1:52:18) just that I would like someone who also treats me like she was making
(1:52:23) compar comparison she was making a comparison to what she said something about black lives matter you heard BLM
(1:52:29) and you perked up yeah oh my I thought you were talking about my nonprofit organization the big matters speaking of
(1:52:36) I think I should share my preferences and standards that was a good point by the way here and I've written a bunch of
() 
(1:52:42) notes because I don't want to forget because it's a very long and exhaustive list of all the things that I want so
(1:52:49) let's see here first off let's talk about race any race is fine but slight
(1:52:55) preference for Asian women and white women I'm just going to be honest that's my preference uh I don't know if you
(1:53:02) guys play World of Warcraft there's like best in slot I okay then Brian I probably should
(1:53:08) you say white women you mean white looking women what do you mean that's a good question what's the difference well I'm
(1:53:15) talking like Latina like Hispanic like my skin color is
(1:53:21) woman identif your experience as a white woman no my experience is of a black woman but being raised I was raised by a
(1:53:29) white woman and I also understand that experience and what that is and so I'm also because I'm literally half I'm also
(1:53:36) a white woman like I don't have the experience you thrown your hat into the ring here I mean I'm just saying I know people will come at me that cuz I don't
(1:53:41) have the I don't have that experience but I to an extent I know the experience but I don't have that myself I don't think he cares about the experience I'm
(1:53:48) saying like for Prim don't get me wrong I'll date doesn't care about the Heritage I'll date a black woman I'll
(1:53:53) date a you know Latino woman I'm just saying slight preference ever so slight
(1:53:59) very very small preference uh petite Fun Size short women uh the shorter the
(1:54:04) better what size is that 54 tall is that tall he it's a bit tall
(1:54:10) for me that's tall for you hers you like little people little people he did say
(1:54:16) that last season 6' one 6' oneish well you're not supposed to say yeah uh you actually are serious yeah he does he's I
(1:54:23) prefer the short women no what she just said oh what did you say you said you like little people last season last
(1:54:28) session last whatever I would it's not it's not so much that I I would I get with a dwarf said preference I would a
(1:54:35) dwarf I'll get with a dwarf you preference for that a little bit not it's not that I have a pre I don't have a preference for dwarfs I'm saying I
(1:54:41) would I would date a woman who is a dwarf okay but I'll also date a woman who's got appropriate like nor normal
(1:54:47) proportions who's also like four five there's there's like four 4 foot n women
(1:54:54) who are just I just like when people say put this around normal normal it's the respected but but there there's like if
(1:55:01) you you can you can be short and considered legally a dwarf or what are
(1:55:07) thees general term person I don't know sometimes what are you quoting I have uh
(1:55:12) what's that thing that um the the guy from Back To The Future Has Tourette's I don't know uh Michael what's his name
(1:55:18) Michael J fox Michael J fox I think I that's probably what's going on I probably shouldn't joke about that but okay um wait what what don't worry about
(1:55:26) it um is it what is what is okay never mind
(1:55:31) uh so short women Natural Body supremacist and obviously I care about
(1:55:36) hygiene and grooming but strong preference for no plastic surgery no makeup no sense
(1:55:42) perfumes uh yeah you know I wonder uh that last part cuz I heard you say that
(1:55:47) the last show which one the the no plastic surgery or anything is that because you think that that of that is a
(1:55:54) sign of vanity yes well there's a few reasons there's a few reasons but you said you
(1:55:59) prefer it because of vanity because you don't like the way it looks and feels well no not vanity on his end no I
(1:56:05) know but he's looking at it well wait wait can't we apply your same double standard objection to your double
(1:56:12) standard here lying if he saying right wait wait no we can just apply far's double standard application here right
(1:56:19) not not attracted to women who get plastic surgery because of vanity he just personally doesn't like the look cuz it's uncanny well no he said few
(1:56:26) Reas said vanity re what are the reasons Brian tell us all oh man okay I mean where do I even begin tell that purely
(1:56:33) aesthetic so purely aesthetic wait what sound you to say a
(1:56:39) long story it's going to be it's going to be very long um I do think that
() 
(1:56:44) somebody who's inclined to get plastic surgery that that could be prox proxy for mental illness and I don't really
(1:56:51) want to date somebody who's mentally ill no like no offense or anything but I'd rather to know women is that a thing did
(1:56:58) you say no um wait what is there actually any
(1:57:05) correlation between cosmetic surgery and mental of course there's there is a little B of course there's coration well because you're essentially suffering
(1:57:11) from body dysmorphia you're so a lot of aspects you're
(1:57:16) so unsatisfied and with your outward facing physical appearance that you're
(1:57:23) going to spend tens of thousands of dollars that you're going to uh undergo
(1:57:28) anesthesia which my granted I most plastic surgeries occur without any
(1:57:34) issue however anytime you go under anesthesia there is a risk of potential
(1:57:40) uh long-term damage or even death so to me unless a surgery is absolutely
(1:57:48) medically indicated and necessary for you to Simply go under the knife for
(1:57:54) purely cosmetic reasons I think is to me would be evidence of body dysmorphia
(1:58:00) although I suppose you could argue that you might not be suffering from body dysmorphia but a woman sees some sort of
(1:58:05) economic benefit for like okay if I get fake or if I get fake boobs and that
(1:58:11) could help me in my career doing only fans or in dating too she might not
(1:58:16) necessarily have body dysmorphia she just might look at it from like okay this might help my odds so you would
(1:58:22) date someone with BD even if they didn't get cosmetic surgery like they just had an Ed but we're all natural and stuff had a what eating disorder closer speak
(1:58:31) yeah so you wouldn't date someone who has body dysmorphia but it's all natural for the same reason because it's
(1:58:36) mentally ill would I not like they have body dysmorphia but
(1:58:42) they haven't had plastic surgery uh I suppose it depends the severity of the impact on their
(1:58:48) day-to-day life I mean if it's if they have it but they it's not otherwise interfering with their life or with the
(1:58:55) relationship I don't think that that necessarily would um be an be an issue
(1:59:02) um acted on I I think acted on uh mental illness by getting the plastic surgery
(1:59:10) that would be but like what about like an acted on Ed if this is to you can tell me eating disorder I think that's I
(1:59:16) think it's fine to talk about that I would assume okay I don't know so you mean like bulimia yeah is that acted on
(1:59:22) that I mean yeah I would say was asking I suppose that would be a red flag
(1:59:28) because I feel like there there's other there's other things that are lingering in the shadows typically I mean so when you're
(1:59:36) talking about the vanity portion this was my the question I was getting at earlier I was curious about is it
(1:59:42) because you think that if they're prioritizing for vanity that that's a sign that they're not going to
(1:59:47) prioritize for you in in the sense that it's very
(1:59:54) self-centered uh I've never thought about it like that but that's that's actually a a good point um I just I like
(2:00:02) modest women and so uh hyperfocus on one's own appearance to the point that
(2:00:08) you're going to spend tens of thousands of dollars and undergo dangerous and unnecessary surgery that's a hyperfocus
(2:00:13) on one's own appearance it seems like that would be something that would lead them to prioritize Maybe themselves yes
(2:00:20) over you right yeah and and just on its own aside from whether they're prioritizing themselves or me I just
(2:00:27) don't find it an attractive personality trait just uh vanity I prefer modesty I
(2:00:33) I much more prefer modesty both in personality and in appearance so so uh I
(2:00:38) have a question and I'm just just out of curiosity so it seems like you seem to deem that more so on the decision than
(2:00:45) anything so if you met someone and got like semi into it you know 3 six months
(2:00:50) in found out they had pretty invasive surgery but had Supernatural results and you had no idea would that impact your
(2:00:57) desire to stay in that relationship um H that's a good
(2:01:03) question well I I think I have I have fake titty Vision
(2:01:08) so well I mean suris is it the boob job that's the issue or like talk
(2:01:14) rhinoplasty jawline chin implants fillers of all kind I don't
(2:01:19) like I don't like any of it obviously though there's I would say there are some procedures that are more invasive
(2:01:26) than others and that tend to change but there are amazing plastic surgeons and new surgeries all the time so is it is
(2:01:32) it plastic surgery as the concept or the blue jobs yeah it's not well it's I think it's everything I wouldn't even
(2:01:38) say so like when you think about what he's saying right if you take a woman
(2:01:43) let's say she was a bad burn victim okay she goes yeah she goes and gets plastic
(2:01:49) surgery right the reason he wouldn't probably wouldn't mind that if like there was a burn on the arm and then you
(2:01:55) know skin grafts and all this and plastic surgery because really is prioritizing towards the vanity it's
(2:02:00) like there's something here I don't prefer it it looks fake it is fake but it's maybe it's sending off other
(2:02:07) signals at the same time and that's totally understandable I guess like what I'm just curious about more than anything is if you're so focused on the
(2:02:16) like mental decision factor which is valid that's that I think that's really valid um but if you're focused on that
(2:02:22) then you find out it's something that isn't the boob job or a burn victim or an extremity but it was just someone who
(2:02:28) simply was like I don't like my chin here's a chin implant but you can't tell because things like that can appear
(2:02:33) natural if done expertly yeah I mean again I think it's the
(2:02:39) degree the one thing that would occur to me is okay well I think both men and
(2:02:45) women will select Partners to some degree based perhaps to a great degree based on physical attractiveness so
(2:02:51) there's a misrepresentation there and obviously I think one of the reasons whether this is something that's conscious or subconscious the way in
(2:02:58) which we find people attractive one of the things that's a thought process there is what are our kids going to look
(2:03:05) like and so and so if there's some and I think there's been stories about this of
(2:03:10) people who have had excessive amounts of plastic surgery in Asia there was a guy who sued his wife I think there might
(2:03:17) have been the story that came that that was a hoax but it certainly could be the case that the woman's had so much
(2:03:23) plastic surgery that she's just moving in the world so deceptively that not
(2:03:29) only is it going to have an impact on your attractiveness to her but if you're
(2:03:34) looking to have children with her um because why do we ultimately find
(2:03:40) physical Beauty attractive and I think aside from our own selfish reasons uh
(2:03:45) from physical from from a physical attractiveness level is we're going to have physically attractive children who
(2:03:52) will be more cap who are will maneuver through the World perhaps better if they're more physically attractive and so I definitely can see that but I guess
(2:03:59) to go back to my original question I was just curious would that be a big like
(2:04:04) potential deal breaker or a diversion in a relationship 3 to six months in CU that's a very fragile time where there's
(2:04:11) emotional involvement but there still can be Fallout very frequently from
(2:04:16) those types of like Miss signals so would that be a either hard deal breaker
(2:04:21) or potential deal breaker well the most egregious forms they're probably not going to like
(2:04:28) that term but the most egregious forms of plastic surgery so I would say uh breast implants BBL and lipo um guys
(2:04:35) there I just saw one on Tik Tok where this guy got his knees and now he's taller just throwing that out there I don't think men should the theight crazy
(2:04:42) but so when you're talking about Offspring like let's say I fall in love with this guy thinking he's 6t tall then
(2:04:47) I get you're tight wait what oh no but I I if if that if a woman objected to a
(2:04:55) man uh because women are attracted to tall men they hope their children I
(2:05:00) don't think that I I don't know if I would you would mind here's the thing not marry my kids so I don't know that I
(2:05:06) would care like I would I would actually argue though that that women like if you found out a guy had I think plastic
(2:05:12) surgery is far less accepted in men than it is in women so for example uh and I there's obviously different
(2:05:19) uh cosmetic surgeries that men undergo but like the one I could maybe think of is like what if a guy and it it frankly
(2:05:25) doesn't look realistic at all but they get the injections the oh mythol what's it called Mason do you know what it's
(2:05:31) called I don't know what it's called but it's essentially oil they they injected into your biceps so your arms look bigger there's also the the things or
(2:05:38) just implants they got actual implants yeah and I there's this old like 20-year-old MTV documentary where this
(2:05:44) guy was insecure about his calves he got calf implants I forgot what that show
(2:05:49) was called I can't what it was but I'm sure a lot of wom would like clown on that you got I don't know that I
(2:05:56) would clown it I don't know that I would necessarily know when I saw it but when I saw it I would be like yeah but but to
(2:06:03) go back to your point like the most egregious one so for me I think that's I mean maybe there's a few the type of surgery seems to be a factor for you
(2:06:08) which makes sense yeah I mean if she's had like if she had had a deviated septum and got a rhinoplasty I well
(2:06:15) first off that would be medically indicated and that's not even on that table then but yeah and that's a fairly the the shift the shift even if it's
(2:06:22) cosmetic rhinoplasty yeah the the actual change in your physical appearance isn't
(2:06:27) that significant but like when it comes to faked HTS BBL lipo I think I think
(2:06:33) it's probably in the order of BBL being the most invasive uh that would be what
(2:06:39) about teeth everyone's getting their teeth now veneers I don't I don't like veneers
(2:06:46) that one that would make me mad I don't know about the anything so much but if if I don't know that you have and I didn't have that choice I would want to
(2:06:52) know that don't they have to grind your teeth down sometimes they do sometimes they don't they have different ways of doing it I believe are you suggesting
(2:06:59) like like uh uh like braces or oh wait what I don't know but I guess braces is
(2:07:05) kind of the same thing though but you can't make them white when they're like not white bra is more more akin to like
(2:07:10) getting a bone set right I just don't think I would get in I mean I I don't want to say it's 100% a deal breaker
(2:07:17) because I mean I would have to meet the woman and she's wonderful but she had or
(2:07:24) has fake breasts but um I mean I just think
(2:07:30) it's there's a lot of fish in the sea and just somebody who has plastic surgery it's a suboptimal dating choice
(2:07:38) right it's not 100% a deal breaker but like generally speaking I certainly don't gravitate gravitate towards women
(2:07:45) with like bbls and and fake tits like I much prefer like I'd much prefer a girl who has like an acup than like big fake
(2:07:52) titties so yeah flat totally you're right I just I guess I was just curious
(2:07:57) cuz you seemed to be really invested in the mental part of making that decision and that and like I said I can see the
(2:08:04) validity in that I mean I'm I'm Pro do whatever the hell you want like if you want plastic surgery get it you know in
(2:08:09) terms for me and it wouldn't be too much of a deal breaker like if I found out I was dating a man who got like hairline
(2:08:16) surgery or like the bruts like for me that wouldn't be a deal breaker either
(2:08:21) um or things like that but I just cuz I just think like if you want to do something to um make you feel better or
(2:08:28) improve yourself that's your right but it's also your right to choose not to date someone if they did that for whatever reason well I think I think we
(2:08:36) as men have a duty to uh cuz I I think both men and women but more so
() 
(2:08:44) women have been sold This Lie by advertisers that you ought to look a certain way you need to buy a certain
(2:08:51) foundation and a certain lip gloss and a you need to you know get look like Kim
(2:08:57) Kardashian you need to have this hourglass figure whatever I think advertisers have women chasing a
(2:09:04) aesthetic and a physique that is very costly or just not attainable and uh I
(2:09:10) think we as men have a duty to fight back against the corporate Greed from the Cosmetic industry and the I suspect
(2:09:18) the billion dollar uh plastic surgery industry because we as men are protectors and I think protection
(2:09:25) doesn't just just mean like some immediate physical threat but also threats of Mind and Body not just
(2:09:32) immediate um like not just an immediate threat if somebody's trying to mug you but like okay how is the world trying
(2:09:40) to to damage women to the point where they feel compelled to go under
(2:09:45) anesthesia get these dangerous and unnecessary unnecessary and expensive
(2:09:51) medical procedures uh for purely aesthetic and cosmetic and uh vanity reasons so I think we as men have a duty
(2:09:58) to uh protect women from that let let me ask you something now I'm just curious about this sure let's say you had a
(2:10:05) daughter and she was a four a hard looks like a four yeah she was a four M and
(2:10:10) she had really low self-confidence okay and it was like eating her up and you
(2:10:16) knew through a series of cosmetic surgery that that would increase her to like a seven or an eight okay and her
(2:10:22) confidence would shoot up and she'd be more likely to attract a mate right like a good high status mate with plastic
() 
(2:10:30) surgery yeah well if it shot her up to a seven or an eight her mind from still be four though would you would you
(2:10:36) recommend that she well no that I don't know there's a lot of women a lot of
(2:10:42) women I've met who've had a bunch of work and suddenly they think they're hot  but let's just say you know it
(2:10:47) should shoots her up to a seven or an eight would you recommend she do it if she came to you and said well you know I
(2:10:53) have confidence issues this kind of thing it's not clear to me though if
(2:11:00) because that it would shoot her up to a seven or eight well not even that but like it would fix her confidence like a
(2:11:06) girl who's a four but she has fake titties is still a four but she was able
(2:11:14) to get a system of um different types of plastic for I don't know maybe I just
(2:11:19) have may maybe I have a different view but I've asked a lot of men on this show like I think most like lip filler looks
(2:11:27) bad fake tits I I don't know doesn't look I don't really like it whatever um
(2:11:34) I I just I don't know like the the Lipo belly does not I'd prefer a girl with a little belly fat than lipo belly it
(2:11:41) looks weird like and these girls that I don't know if there's a procedure to Something in the would you so you would
(2:11:47) kind of like tell her stay of four you think would I or would I tell her the story I don't know he's necessarily
(2:11:53) raing his daughter I would say first off I intend to to uh bir a 10 to breed with
(2:12:01) with a uh very attractive I get it I get it um no no no but uh I would encourage
(2:12:06) her that that there will be a man who will find her beautiful and attractive
(2:12:14) and sexy the way she is and not to do any of that and you don't to do any
(2:12:19) of that and right answer and I I what I would say what I would say also is hey
(2:12:26) uh you can make yourself more physically attractive uh get in the gym like that's
(2:12:31) what I was about to say get like a nice you can get a a very attractive body I mean face there's not much you can do
(2:12:37) but uh obviously grooming hygiene but get in the gym I because you know what's crazy is and I know you I know you want
(2:12:43) to come in Mason I'll just finish this really quick a lot of women spend so much time time on their beauty through
(2:12:49) like makeup and getting manicures and all this stuff and they spend a lot of money like buying makeup and and I
(2:12:56) think like you you could order you could improve your physical attractiveness
(2:13:02) orders of magnitude more and probably spend less money by
(2:13:08) just going to the gym like you you guys want to cheat with your beauty you want to cheat and let me just put on the face
(2:13:14) of makeup no just like get in the gym like you say gy with beauty as if the
(2:13:21) gym is the only thing that can make you beautiful well the the gym is probably the most powerful tool that can make you
(2:13:27) beautiful like so personally no no just so personally like so before I started
(2:13:33) getting really into the gym I would say I was probably around like I was pretty
(2:13:39) average like 5 and 1 half six I mean I I got an okay looking face I'm an average
(2:13:45) looking dude but then when I got in the gym like all of a sudden that just changed double
(2:13:50) bicep can we see double bicep Hercules Hercules myON I just
(2:13:57) think that oh sorry oh yeah so yeah and I think so with the gym comes I think
(2:14:03) something subconscious that happens in someone who sees somebody that goes to the gym but like when I'm sitting in the
(2:14:09) gym and let's say I'm sitting in this hesty room and I'm like relaxing and I'm sitting next to a guy who's got a physique like you and I look down in his
(2:14:15) toenail and it looks like haggardly Haggard m i don't give F about his body
(2:14:20) okay yeah kind of misses the we're missing okay we're missing the point so
(2:14:25) okay well think about it this way go to gym and not have disgusting toenails
(2:14:31) right that's true but I'm just saying that's not the only that so generally when so if we're going to speak in like
(2:14:37) the majority of cases so someone a a population of people that go to the gym there's something subconscious that
(2:14:43) happens in people who see them where like they someone goes to the gym by
(2:14:48) looking at them you wouldn't look at me and be like oh she goes that's true would that's true but I do so no okay
() 
(2:14:54) but so people who who go to the gym follow
(2:15:00) a a well-designed program no no I didn't think no that absolutely there's
(2:15:05) something about like you should because I don't right that's the point you're
(2:15:11) supposed to be a look it's not the way it's the you're literally your skin what the it's it's your skin it wouldn't
(2:15:17) be just like your because I see Dad Bots there's all kinds of different bodies that go to the gym 100% I can tell by just like the way you're moving the way
(2:15:24) you're carrying yourself your skin radiate is not I don't know what any of that means well that's some of the
(2:15:29) things that come from the gym as well when you're going the sweat clears out your your skin you're going to have more
(2:15:36) Radiance movement you're stretching this goes this goes exactly into my point so there's something that is hard earned by
(2:15:43) putting in hard work so when you go to the gym I do like Jim I get what you're saying when I go to the gym I'm like
(2:15:48) even their mindset is like in a better place well yeah so obvious yeah I mean just mindset alone it's like one and a
(2:15:55) half times more effective than uh drugs happier people exact agre so the gym
(2:16:00) provides all of these positive benefit we to call the gym okay so uh yeah working out so it provides all of these
(2:16:08) benefits like just simply cosmetically as well like and so your attitude your
(2:16:14) confidence you do stuff that is difficult to do like that that you
(2:16:19) people perceive that and they see it and that is something that's hard-earned and
(2:16:24) there's something subconscious that happens in somebody where if I was to look at somebody who bought all of their
(2:16:30) physical attributes so BBL lipo those people are in the gym too we see well okay so so but somebody who's doing that
(2:16:38) generally is like okay I want to get this quick I just want to solve this problem immediately or they think that's
(2:16:44) not something they can attain like some people just are not going to have ass they're cheating chea some people are just not going to
(2:16:49) have lips you can't work your lips out well well there so be happy with your lip be happy with your small you should
(2:16:55) be happy with your body and just try to be healthy it always kind of moves towards anytime we're talking these
(2:17:00) generalities kind of moves towards an extrem towards the outlier it's always a move towards the outlier it's
(2:17:06) like way to not kind of engage with what's being said it's like obviously
(2:17:11) the spirit of what's being said is if you go to the gym for most people it's going to improve your appearance I don't
(2:17:17) think anybody's going to disagree with that right yeah cuz even if it's not necessarily about weight loss you know muscle muscle
(2:17:23) distribution like your ability to be more active like there are other factors um I think a healthy way of looking at
(2:17:30) going to the gym is just about um being consistent yeah consistent maintenance like I mean if you have goals for weight
(2:17:37) loss great then that's what you should do also another thing with the whole plastic surgery thing is like if this is
() 
(2:17:43) going to be a long-term partner and if she's expecting you to provide like this is going to be a much higher maintenance
(2:17:48) woman than a woman who is not particularly vain the the upkeep on her is going to be much higher for example
(2:17:54) my understanding when it comes to breast implants for example you're going to need those replaced I think at minimum
(2:18:00) two or three times in your lifetime so that's you're going to need aren't you the 50-50 guy huh don't you go 50-50 on
(2:18:07) dates well that we that chick is not going on a date with you Brian what are you talking about anyways like she's just not going to go on a date with you
(2:18:12) anyways you don't have to worry about her maintenance because she's already going to know from date number one when you but I'm also fine she's not going to
(2:18:19) be not if she's got to get breast impants every 5 years she's going to look for someone who's going to pay for everything which is precisely why I
(2:18:24) would I even but even if I was let's let's say I was inclined and I do think
(2:18:29) I'm I actually am okay like I'd be okay with a stay-at-home wife but I I would also be
(2:18:37) okay if she wanted to work and I would be okay with that uh however I
(2:18:42) sorry I lost my I lost my train thought so oh she she would be high maintenance
(2:18:47) right so okay so what's the cost of a you know you need to get the breast rone okay that's 10,000 a pop and then she's
(2:18:54) going to want other she's going to want like I don't give a you don't like for me for a girl you don't need
(2:18:59) fake nails you don't need to wear makeup you don't need any plastic surgery you don't need to wear perfume you don't
(2:19:04) need like nothing do not give a you don't like perfume what is that about I
(2:19:09) kind of I don't like I don't like the scent it's it can be overpowering theones are more attractive no it's just
(2:19:15) I don't like it first you're going to have phones or perfume so what do you mean no wait what pheromones are like
(2:19:21) your natural body smell I don't even no he's not talking about things like women
(2:19:26) wearing deodorant things like that deodorant's talking he's talking about like hor musk you know what I mean no
(2:19:31) what is hor musk hor musk I just don't like perfume I just walk so you're walking through this happens at
(2:19:38) restaurants I'm talking perfume yeah yeah got you'll be walking through you'll be walking through a restaurant everyone didn't want hear the story just
(2:19:43) put off by this by strong there some chick will walk by and he'll be like allergies so she's instantly hor I have
(2:19:49) allergies it tends to linger I don't like the smell that's hor musk because she's a woman and she's got a smell no I
(2:19:55) don't know it's the perfume there's a specific perfume they're saying that if they put like too much or you know he's
(2:20:02) saying at all he don't want it I don't know I don't want any perfume look obviously grooming hygiene very
(2:20:07) important if you deodorant's fine but I do not like uh I don't like perfume let's talk a little bit about um let's
(2:20:14) talk a little bit about personality traits though I've talked a lot about physical so uh let's see I like women
() 
(2:20:20) with well this is kind of physical women with nice voices I like uh I like women with soft Pleasant soft Pleasant
(2:20:28) voices uh let's see oh personality okay uh Mo I would say moderate preference
(2:20:34) for introverted women quiet calm softspoken little bit shy a little bit nerdy modesty is huge I don't like women
(2:20:41) with like big big egos who are super vain Divas got be the main character
(2:20:46) what's that got to be the main character me no I'm saying like women who want to be the main main character syndrome mhm
(2:20:53) brings me peace doesn't quarrel doesn't party doesn't drink doesn't do drugs doesn't go to bars or clubs low body
(2:20:58) count no current or past promiscuity undivided romantic and sexual attention the earlier the better uh I for some
(2:21:07) reason I wrote down has a praise King isn't that a mark of promiscuity though wait what is if if you they give you the
(2:21:14) undivided sexual attention and they do it quickly no meant well undivided so it's not it's not so much the the
(2:21:20) rapidity with which they give it but when I say undivided romantic and sexual attention with that that's more so
(2:21:25) pointing towards they're not giving it to other guys anybody but him at the
(2:21:30) first there's not talking phases you immediately he's the Unicorn basically even even if I haven't met her so it's
(2:21:37) like the assumption is that like most women will give their attention to multiple guys he just wants a girl that
(2:21:42) will give it like one at a time yes essentially yes but if she sleeps with you early on isn't that a good a good
(2:21:49) signal that it could it could it's I like if he had to guess if he had to guess no I don't actually think I
(2:21:58) actually don't think the quickness with which a woman sleeps with you necessarily is an indicator get
(2:22:05) necessarily promiscuity yeah get necessarily but if you had to bet but in the general population comparing say a
(2:22:11) woman who sleeps with you on the first date versus a woman who does it by the second even
(2:22:17) does it by the second yeah even if they do it by the second like if you were to bet about if you were to take bets on
(2:22:22) the women who won't sleep with a man over a long a period of Time Versus those who jump right into bed with them
(2:22:28) very quickly if you had to bet on the past promiscuity you would say that would be yes it would definitely be more
(2:22:35) likely it would be more likely but uh yeah you know uh let's see what else
(2:22:41) uh we're still doing your preferences yeah yeah so this long I told you it let's see oh a who helps me in my
(2:22:48) mission a girl who is attentive a girl who scratches my back are you advertising right now or this related no

() 
(2:26:44) drop us a prime sub I had a question want to go around on this does anybody here have or previously have had a
(2:26:51) roster oh god oh yeah yeah especially when I was I I had so I didn't really go
(2:26:57) to college but when I was 27 I had like what I would consider my party phase
(2:27:02) absolutely part party phase yeah I went to like um different like BB BBW parties
(2:27:10) in uh when I lived in Georgia okay I got some notes on that I think um what's uh
(2:27:15) what's BBW for big beautiful woman it was originally started as a porn category and eventually was co-opted as
(2:27:21) just like an an identifier that fat women some fat women use I used to I
(2:27:26) don't anymore they have parties for that um people who are them and people who like them yeah okay so uh you had a
(2:27:35) roster so what uh what was the size of the roster depended um a point where I
(2:27:41) got I got oh it depended on the on the situation in the beginning it was a bit long younger but um like when I was
(2:27:49) living in Georgia at the time I had my own place were you in Atlanta uh close I was like North Metro Atlanta like right
(2:27:55) on the outskirts but I would go down to different events in the Atlanta area um
(2:28:01) all the time but um yeah I was like it was during my first breakup like I
(2:28:07) mentioned me and my ex who broke up for 9 months that was during 2019 and um so what that was like when I
(2:28:14) first really co-opted like I mentioned earlier the get under to get over it didn't work the first time so I don't
(2:28:20) know why I tried it again well how big how big was the roster two guys three guys Four Guys couple was you said
(2:28:25) you're by right so maybe a couple girls yeah I mean that was when I explored my sexuality so I I did hook up with a
(2:28:31) couple girls um but
(2:28:37) uh Five Guys this I would say I would probably
(2:28:43) say it was anywhere between like what Madison what are you do nothing I'm just
(2:28:49) like getting delusional right now I haven't had much to eat today there's whatever cookies over there thank you
(2:28:56) there's still whatever cies I mean there was a few people but for me it was more like situationship um but I was I was just
(2:29:04) kind of like way too casual I was I was be I was like doing stuff that I would never do now I had my moment I learned
(2:29:12) my learned what was your moment what is your moment um well so some of the parties were like regular parties but
(2:29:17) some of them were swinger parties okay how was that fun but problematic that's
(2:29:23) the best that's the best way to answer it shortly how many how many uh cuz I in my notes Here you I think you mentioned
(2:29:30) BBW Polly parties sex parties um how many of these parties would you say you
(2:29:35) went to just a couple or like regular over the span of six months when I was in the thick of it they had basically
(2:29:42) parties every other weekend okay and you would go pretty much every other about at least four months I did four months I
(2:29:48) mean I didn't always do something at the party but it would depend like on if I had invited people I was I already knew
(2:29:55) there or if I met someone whatever happened at these parties do people typically just like will they hook up
() 
(2:30:01) maybe they don't hook up at all but if they do hook up is it with just one person or will they like sleep with like
(2:30:07) multiple people like for example you did you ever hook up with like two dudes in a night or three dudes in a
(2:30:15) night yeah more yeah more I there's a specific High
(2:30:21) number for the the most I did in one night but let's hear it um you got it I haven't talked about
(2:30:28) this stuff in such a long time I just want to before I go into this topic I do want to say this isn't who I currently
(2:30:35) am toally I'm talking about a past verion myself that totally F would not make these decisions now but at one
(2:30:41) night 10 was that like an intentional goal like you went in no it actually was kind
(2:30:47) of accidental I just like I was I was very L fair about life at the time and
(2:30:53) um it was something where I had been like I felt very repressed and like my
(2:30:58) first real relationship lasted eight years I had one before that but it only lasted 5 months and so when we or at the
(2:31:07) time I'm sorry it would have been about six but six years after your 8-year relationship ended or in the mid so I
(2:31:14) had two I had I we broke up for 9 months and then when we got back together and
(2:31:19) we broke up officially that was like in 2021 okay how does that well how does that happen like honestly how does you
(2:31:26) just like I'm depressed I'm going to go get inv involved in a gang I mean I was I was I
(2:31:32) self-actualized in the moment about that not really it was just more like you
(2:31:37) know very repressed childhood didn't I never really let myself go crazy and I I basically let
(2:31:45) myself like like have my wild funfree because I was in an environment where I
(2:31:50) kind of felt like I was not only supported but like really wanted desired
(2:31:56) which um I had had experienced obviously cuz I been in a relationship but not in
(2:32:02) like that type of casual way and so I got invited into it by someone and um I
(2:32:08) didn't know what I was getting into is of good though to have that acceptance did you come back for I met people who
(2:32:15) like I'm still friends with like I met people who most of them have walked away
(2:32:21) because once you're in it for a little bit you do like start to really not only see the toxicity around you but within
(2:32:28) yourself and um it took me going through a couple other things post this experience that made me realize that
(2:32:35) like I was chasing like a a high like I was using sex in ways that weren't
(2:32:42) healthy and like it made me self-reflect it made me change if you could go back
(2:32:49) now would you do would you do the same thing I've thought about that question a
(2:32:54) lot now honestly I think I would because I am the kind of person to live my life
(2:33:00) with no regrets and I believe that everything I've been through everything I've done and every decision I've made
(2:33:05) has led me to where like who I am at my heart as of today and while I wish I could have done things better and I
(2:33:11) could have had better results in certain aspects of my life I love myself and I love who I am and I I sorry I'm not
(2:33:19) laughing at you fine just um and I I love how I can
(2:33:26) turn but is it a regret and again that's one of those things where it's a yes and it's like I
(2:33:32) don't want to have like I understand the mindset of I live in a less Reckless way let's say
(2:33:39) that I wish I could have learned certain lessons in a less Reckless way cuz I feel like I was Reckless I was
(2:33:45) recklessly dating I was recklessly like living I was I was at that point in my
(2:33:51) life in in that situation that's not how everybody was in those scenes but that's how I was so
(2:33:58) you said you would do it again I would I I'm the kind of person where like I wouldn't want to go back and change
(2:34:04) anything about my life because I want to be who I am that's kind of tail then
(2:34:11) you would do it again you said you would do it again yes so how so I'm just curious cuz you said you're not that
(2:34:17) person anymore yeah so where's the Nuance in that she's not saying that she would do it now she's saying the person
(2:34:22) that she has become today and the reason why she might not choose to do it anymore is because she already had that experience and she decided it's not
(2:34:28) something she moves forward with and I I learned life lessons from it and that is I I have lived my life being the kind of
(2:34:36) person that has to um learn from my own mistakes and
(2:34:41) learn from doing things and I struggle I feel like for things to fully click or
(2:34:47) land until I've experienced them for myself do you think it's a healthy process though to so I understand the
(2:34:55) mindset of saying live live without regret right you can't dwell on regrets that's true right eventually people have
(2:35:00) to move forward from things that they've done they this and that but is it also though still healthy to have things that
(2:35:07) you regret isn't that how you progress yes and that's why I'm saying cuz like I mean do I regret the recklessness yes
(2:35:15) but yeah I don't like dwell in them and I try to live on the the thing of like I don't
(2:35:21) want to hold shame within regret May that's what I'm tration of regret is so negative like why can't it be something
(2:35:27) like a lesson learned like for instance I hear what you're saying and there's definitely things where I'm like dang like that probably wasn't the best
(2:35:33) choice or if it presented itself right now I would definitely choose different but acknowledging that what had happened
(2:35:39) in the past made me who I am today made me as strong as I am today or made me as sof or whatever the positives were that
(2:35:46) had to happen to be who I am today so I can what probably instead of regret maybe just respect respect that it
() 
(2:35:52) happened this might be like a difference in worldview too but I think that regrets are necessary for us to move
(2:35:59) forward in life and here's what I mean by this okay I mean that you should look
(2:36:04) on some of the things you've done in life in a negative way for yourself and negatively view yourself for having done
(2:36:11) those things and that's the only way to reconcile them to move on from them yeah we disagree in that but I also um I'm I
(2:36:18) was raised really really um religious and I know that that's part of um the religious standpoint is that you know
(2:36:25) sins and um well well it's actually kind of but there is
(2:36:30) Absolution right but Absolution comes with the confrontation that the thing you did was wrong and it should never be
(2:36:37) repeated and you know it was wrong that's where absolute sure but acknowledging something is wrong and
(2:36:43) regret are not necessarily the same things and how do you know what's wrong with if you don't regret it you can look
(2:36:48) at the outcome of it you can look at the intention with of what you know your action was I I'm the person I'm a type
(2:36:54) of person who believes in positive negative and so I'll look at more of the intention of it and lesson learn is still going to happen um but I don't
(2:37:00) need to look at it necessarily as a negative to make it be something that I
(2:37:06) learned but that feels like it's just a way to avoid responsibility you say avoid but I still learned from that yeah
(2:37:12) but it's still by saying like um there's no real this is negative but I don't regret it
(2:37:18) this is negative but it wasn't bad this is negative no one said it wasn't bad not bad's a moral claim so that's why we
(2:37:24) said the word bad so I'll try to use a different word yeah okay but what what you're saying is I don't regret this
(2:37:30) thing there was a negative outcome and so I'll avoid it in the future but there's no regret what I'm saying is that that would from my perspective
(2:37:37) stimy the growth so the way that you grow as a person is to actually focus on
(2:37:43) the things that you have done which are incorrect otherwise you can't actually repent for
(2:37:48) those things in order to move forward there's something to be said about the fact that we're still humans and this is a human experience we're growing and
(2:37:55) we're learning so there's going to be right so there's going to be an amount of yeah you're going to make a mistake
(2:38:00) to for me personally if I Harbor regret I'm living in the past I'm living living
(2:38:06) in the present and me living in the past gives me anxiety it it it doesn't allow meos to that's the point I think I think
(2:38:14) what has to happen is you have to come to the position where I regret that decision I'm doing that moral I I'm just
(2:38:21) doing that battle Within Myself like sussing out what was good about the situation what was bad but then after
(2:38:28) you do all of that work then you can move move on but when someone asks you about that point in your life where you
(2:38:34) made that regretful decision you can discuss with them this is what I sused out this is how I worked through it and
(2:38:41) that this is how it has led me to where I am right now reget I think but when I
(2:38:48) think about the word regret I think about something where I wish this didn't happen that's what I was trying to say
(2:38:53) the problem is that when I say I wish this didn't happen I don't acknowledge of what I learned from it yeah but if
(2:38:58) you if you no it's not an I wish this didn't happen it's an acknowledge that's what regret would I did this and it was
(2:39:04) me too that's my understanding wrong and that's why I regret it well I also don't believe in
(2:39:10) wrong I believe in positive and negative and that's what I said right so for me from my perspective it looks like a way
(2:39:15) to avoid responsibility by saying I didn't do anything wrong mhm no no no
(2:39:21) absolutely not I think that but then what you just said you only believe in positive it was about doing something wrong right it's like okay so let's say
(2:39:28) for instance a something I called a regret in my past was I had this big crush on this guy when I was in Mexico on a vacation and we're underneath a
(2:39:35) waterfall and I could have kissed him and I didn't and I looked back and like I regret that I didn't just make that move I was scared I regret and what I
(2:39:40) took from that is okay when I have a moment that I want to do better I um will will make that jump I will not be
(2:39:47) scared and I will have the confidence to do it and I told myself I don't ever want to have regret again because it doesn't feel good to have that sort of
(2:39:53) thing and so I would look at it instead as like okay that was a moment that I wasn't at this level I had to learn to
(2:39:59) become this level and now I am who I am today yeah so I think I think we're talking like if you're talking about a
(2:40:06) level of regret it could be scalable so there could be things so there could be things that I regret like um maybe I die
(2:40:13) and say I regret not climbing Mount Everest right yeah but I think that the things that stick in our brain for the
(2:40:19) things that we regret the most generally coexist with things that we knew we were doing in the time which was wrong you
(2:40:26) know what I mean and those tend to be the things that we actually dwell on and that's have any of those in my mind like
(2:40:31) what I'm trying to think back like you're all right because you only believe in positive and negatives so that's that's why when I think about
(2:40:36) something like oh like but that's why I see it as sh better I shouldn't have said this or done this I think okay well
(2:40:42) you were in a place where clearly you didn't know or you didn't make that assessment now you do know all you can do forward now is make it better now if
(2:40:48) you don't make it better then you're not choosing to be living in your most positive aspect and that will be something you we won't necessarily agree
(2:40:55) on there but I want to live at my highest vibrational um level which means that I'm going to be positive to people the energy that put out I'm going to
(2:41:02) expect to receive which means that generally I'm going to not try to do bad things onto others because I know that's
(2:41:07) going to come back to me tenfold I need to move on just so I can get through my notes here but uh let's see we had well
(2:41:12) I do want to come back really quick to the whole BB W poly party sex party thing of course you
(2:41:19) do so uh tell us I mean there's a bunch I mean
(2:41:25) I'm not really one to get super salacious on the internet about specifics but he wants an invite I think
(2:41:32) he oh yeah I think that's what he definitely seems to be the type into BBW
(2:41:37) RSVP just the this is sex party part yeah oh I mean they they have them for all types all types of people I would I
(2:41:44) would actually never go to a sex party never is a long no matter how attractive the women were that's a party just for
(2:41:52) you just all Asian PT women with no oh for me I mean I can get behind that one
(2:41:58) that point that's just an orgy I can get behind that but like if it's like swingers and like no you don't want
(2:42:04) anybody to watch you no I get all the women to myself yeah I'll sure I'll take that never never going to happen but
(2:42:12) I'll gladly take it um Okay so so you would uh you went to a bunch of
(2:42:18) these parties over the course of a couple months um now when you said there were you did 10 in a night would it be
(2:42:24) like was it group sex or would it be like one after the other and it was like individual sex
(2:42:31) okay good good times good times in a very like rapid physical way yeah okay
(2:42:40) all right and let's see uh well the original question was the roster thing so we're going around the table uh do do
(2:42:47) you have or have you ever excuse me do you currently have or have you ever had a roster no I'm like disgustingly
(2:42:54) monoamorous I get like Tunnel Vision on the first dat and I'll like delete dating apps if I like someone okay so
(2:42:59) annoying um I am similar and I'm trying sorry how's knowing that I do that as
(2:43:05) well like I hyperfocus like I'll I'll T I'll tunnel vision someone um which I've actually had to get out of doing um
(2:43:11) because dating okay goad go ahead sorry they just say you shouldn't do that so I've been trying not to roster roster
(2:43:18) roster I I I tend not to have a roster no okay what about you no what if please
(2:43:23) speak into the mic if you can no and the guys don't need to answer and
(2:43:28) whatever of course so is that across the board yes is that what that is and I will say I definitely don't
(2:43:35) feel like my my like future SLC current goals are not roster based like in fact
(2:43:40) the people that I've had like situationally they' fizzled out because I've kind of just
(2:43:46) I'm just not interested in that anymore I'm looking for like a completely different dating experience that's just
(2:43:52) like where I was on that okay got it and let me get into some my notes here finally so uh let's see uh okay you said
(2:44:02) you had some insane stories to tell us Rosie is this related to the BBW sex Wier groups or yeah I mean like yeah
(2:44:10) like with the group sex and stuff like um Nick could you close that door but but I the rest of the world doesn't need
(2:44:17) to hear this more or less I mean it seems like the the audience here is pretty not
(2:44:24) interested in hearing about those types of things they might be no this audience is people out there because the door
(2:44:30) open are going the door no no it's just getting cold that's why it's cold the
(2:44:35) young children outside yeah the young children outside don't need to hear this that's all I'm saying yeah well I just think
(2:44:44) that I'm trying to think cuz I I probably should have thought this more thoroughly because I was thinking about like I
(2:44:49) mentioned some of those different dating experiences but like I mean I met people who I like during that time the closest
(2:44:56) thing I had to a relationship because I was like extremely emotionally unavailable was someone that I met
(2:45:02) through um what what they called like the vanilla parties which were like the nonsex parties um and um he ended up
(2:45:11) like going to them and stuff and uh we would hook up probably like you know a few times a week I'd say and like once
(2:45:20) he and I became more of a thing I like backed down of the parties and then some stuff started coming up and I started
(2:45:26) really understanding like the Dynamics of the parties and like how kind of predatory and weird they were set up and
(2:45:32) I started waking up to like basically realizing what I was doing cuz I was I at the time I was living my life on
(2:45:38) autop pilot and I was just kind of like yeah yeah whatever like nothing matters type attitude toward
(2:45:45) everything so um once I started like
(2:45:50) thinking things through and then I I was like slowly backing out of the parties and then something um like major like
(2:45:57) personally in my life happened that had me completely back out of it okay um you said in your notes here that uh you've
(2:46:04) you're currently celibate by choice while on your healing Journey you're no longer casually dating how long have you
(2:46:09) been celibate for so the last time I hooked up with someone was in February or no I'm sorry that's wrong um since
(2:46:16) June but that was a uh kind of like a return thing with with uh you recycled
(2:46:23) it was like going back to somebody it wasn't like a new dating experience it wasn't a new body you recycled the body
(2:46:29) sure if you want to use that kind of language recycl that's what that's what it's called recycling if you don't want
(2:46:35) to add to your body not doing it again if you've already done it once with them it's like uh you're recycling a body
(2:46:42) okay all right now you don't you object to the just such a deranged way of looking at like human relationships well
(2:46:49) I mean that's you're talking purely sex feel like it's at least so obsessed quantity you'd rather just say recycle a
(2:46:54) body like it's just that's the terminology that's that's the terms people You' never don't F voluntarily uh
(2:47:01) wait what like that's just like not like people who like normally date and see each other aren't using these terms it's
(2:47:07) very like dehumanized I've never used that it's not dehumanizing like you're studying romance from afar from like an
(2:47:12) incel Community oh yeah so it's all insults how dare they how dare well how
(2:47:18) dare people use something that obviously this is actually a term wait wait
(2:47:24) wait stop pay picking for him right now y let me talk please this is a term I've
(2:47:29) actually heard originating from women women use this term oh I'm recycling a body so I don't add to my body pressure
(2:47:36) of this like Obsession to always have a low body count so I've heard women say too like I'm recycling bod so my body count doesn't go you've heard it from
(2:47:43) women too so why are you saying that it's like it's like this incel community it's like from men and I mean women insults exist
() 
(2:47:51) no I'm not about women inels but I disagree I don't think a woman can be an inso yeah why is that like genuinely I'm
(2:47:57) curious because men men will do anything with two legs because
(2:48:02) because not all men say all men if any woman if any woman was so inclined to
(2:48:08) get laid she could regardless of her personality regardless of her level of
(2:48:14) physical ATT I guess I think there's no it's the belie system well for example there was
(2:48:20) a there was a Reddit Community dedicated to Fem cells women who consider themselves involuntarily celibate and it
(2:48:28) like was bombarded with men who were propositioning these women with sex the
(2:48:33) reverse is not the case there's not just women flocking to incel communities to 
(2:48:38) these right if there was a male version of you he's not having sex at sex
(2:48:44) parties and having sex with people back in June there's not it's not going to happen you think sex party why would you disagree
(2:48:52) with that he's go to the SE sex party I would say well I what I would argue though is that a man who's obese is
(2:48:59) going to struggle far more when it comes to purely getting sex than a woman who's obese that's the point yeah well you're
(2:49:06) not really an insult you can go to Nevada and book a prostitute if you want to well but that would still be
(2:49:12) involuntarily yeah because in that case prostitution is not doesn't count he's talking about he's yeah he's talking
(2:49:18) about sex between uh two consenting adults absent money when you're not paying them for it that's the point of
(2:49:25) it okay yeah like oh well I mean you could just go buy a a prostitute what we
(2:49:31) want is different too like women want the money I mean will be okay with having money and men like the the the
(2:49:38) drive is also very different wait just in general like you mean the sex drive yeah like for instance like a man
(2:49:44) doesn't necessarily like a man would pay for sex but a woman won't necessarily have to pay for sex but there's other things that we might do that we'll have
(2:49:51) to like for intimacy exactly Point like when we talk about incels like they
(2:49:56) could book a prostitute but typically like you were saying they're looking for someone who's like enthusiastically consenting to it so typically they're
(2:50:01) not just looking for sex because they could go to a hooker they're looking for some level of intimacy so analogously fem cells yes they could be
(2:50:07) propositioned by those guys on the Reddit but they're looking for someone who actually cares about them comp this
(2:50:13) is also bad presupposition for a different reason another reason this is a bad presupposition is they may not be going to a hooker not because they don't
(2:50:19) want to or they don't just want sex but because they may have religious convictions or other values which
(2:50:25) conflict with doing something like that so if they have that strong of a religious conviction should be so
(2:50:30) hellbent almost done calm down calm down far before you start spur talking and turbo talking let me just finish the
(2:50:36) point I think I'm saying a sound just it'll be just as sound when I'm done maybe let's just we just got to
(2:50:42) avoid bad at I'm S I have to moderate myself so anyway just yeah just chill out I'm almost done chill out chill out
(2:50:47) chill out I'm when they say calm down yeah so I didn't say calm down you calm down so anyway what what I what I was
(2:50:55) getting at here was just to say there could be other convictions there there could be other convictions which are
(2:51:00) here that they adhere to now most popularly what I see online with people who refer to as incels is that their
(2:51:07) standards are extremely high because they have those religious convictions they can't find a woman who can meet
(2:51:13) those standards why would they go byy a prostitute if their religious convictions prevent them from doing it
(2:51:20) be an Insel because you can't find a woman who matches his values that's literally voluntary that's like me saying I'm an Insel because I can't find
(2:51:26) a guy who six foot makes a million dollars a year and wants to date me that's ridiculous when you're talking about uh somebody who is uh in celent by
(2:51:34) choice would you say then right or I'm sorry um yeah yeah celibate by choice if
(2:51:41) you're just talking anybody can just who can just go go have sex with anybody right you can go get a prostitute or or
(2:51:47) this type of thing okay obviously a person's going to have sex with another person is going to go for their
(2:51:53) preferences right isn't that generally what they're going to do to choose if they're yes and like we're saying
(2:51:58) there's two different metrics for male and female preferences but suddenly You're Now using the default as the male
(2:52:04) preference so even if he doesn't want to  a girl because she has different religious values why is that difference than me saying even though guys are
(2:52:10) propositioning me on Reddit they're not the type of guy I'm looking for so therefore I can still de myself a fem cell yeah I'm well I'm assuming it both
(2:52:16) ways so I assume it on the other way too that you believe fem cells exist that well yeah I'm not said you didn't well I
(2:52:23) have a I have a different I have a different definition you think fils exist if it's from the religious connotation yeah just religious well I
(2:52:29) have a different not from the idea of yes I could this guy but I won't enjoy it I won't be attracted to him it'll feel very all those things could
(2:52:35) be true but it would be from a religious standpoint no but you can have that without being religious yeah generally speaking a religious I have feelings
(2:52:42) like that and I'm not religious so if I'm very unattractive and I can only  guys who are like disgusting to me or but that's not for religious reasons
(2:52:49) that I'm unattracted to them I wouldn't I still be a fem cell by your definition if you were super like super ugly you
(2:52:54) mean like just a super yeah I mean I guess so you think the person's I'm talking in generalities here so I'm just
(2:53:00) saying generally that's what I would fit in that criteria wait what's your question so you think the the appearance is the majority factor of whether or not
(2:53:05) someone is an Insel usually for a man it's more than their appearance usually it's the inside I think I think that there could be there's two there's two
(2:53:12) categories here yeah incels that look just like any one of you guys and they're feeling like they don't have sex
(2:53:17) and the reason why is because we're so turned off by their inside and the first thing that comes out of their mouth we couldn't possibly CL doing anything with
(2:53:23) them yeah I'm not clear well okay there's first off I my sense of what an incel is is
(2:53:30) it's involuntarily celibate so this is somebody I I would argue that and maybe
(2:53:37) Andrew this is where I disagree if say you're a Christian man and you're waiting until
(2:53:43) marriage that would I would consider that to be voluntary yeah I have a hard time with that because then far like
(2:53:49) would you apply that to sa so well wait a second they're they're involuntary why
(2:53:55) couldn't they just go sa a check right they could do that and then it wouldn't be they would be involuntarily
(2:54:01) equivalency why because sex and aay are not comparable no but what I'm saying is
(2:54:07) is that if it's if it's not just a barrier based around personalization right and preferences
(2:54:14) then you're looking at the same thing from the religious to if you were looking at it from the the and the
(2:54:19) argument against the religious is well no this is voluntary because you could just go get a prostitute it's like well
(2:54:24) no it's involuntary they want to do it right but they have a barrier from doing
(2:54:30) it just like the lack of the the sa portion would be the same thing a barrier from doing it I genuinely don't
(2:54:36) think a lion share of incels are opting out of booking a hooker for religious reasons I'm pretty sure a large number
(2:54:41) of porn consumers are in cells so if they were opting out of sex for religious reasons they wouldn't be like consuming so much por yeah so you don't
(2:54:47) think that people who are heavily religious would would like to have sex that they might have those wants to do
(2:54:52) that's not what involuntary means yeah I think but this is where I'm drawing a distinction with you because if your argument for no that's not involuntary
(2:55:00) it means if if if you say involuntary they could just go get you know a a sex worker then why couldn't I just respond
(2:55:07) by saying well if it's invol why couldn't they just go assaulted chick get the same result how would it be involuntary for because if I call
(2:55:13) someone home I'm saying yeah they could squat somewhere technically illegally but I would still consider them homeless what does that have to do with what I
(2:55:19) said it's an analogy yeah but how's the analogy apply because doing something unlawfully doesn't make it doesn't now
(2:55:25) make it sex it well wait a second wait wait back up what what is it then I'm
(2:55:31) saying if they're an incel it's just unlawful sex right my point is if they're an incel and they're complaining that they just can't get sex they can
(2:55:37) book a hooker but that's typically not what they're looking they're looking for a level of emotional iny that's my but
(2:55:42) this what I'm saying there's a barrier they're both what you would consider one's a legally the other one's legal
(2:55:48) yeah but but they're both barriers is the point people I don't think people are opting out a hookers for religious
(2:55:53) reasons why you don't think so no why maybe some are but I'm saying an inel an
(2:56:00) incel who's jacking off the every day isn't now Drawing the Line at PR created two different categories of incel for
(2:56:06) you I'm saying that one I believe that both of them are involuntarily talking about the actual
(2:56:11) incel Community the people on Reddit we're not talk about is an actual Mar to
(2:56:16) heard have you ever heard of The tradcast Who self ID as incels for instance the reason that they self ID as
(2:56:22) incels because they say yeah sure we would love to be rolling around and having tons of sex with women but we
(2:56:27) don't right because we have this Exel so would he be an incel if he struggles to find a virgin like if every single woman
(2:56:34) at his college has had sex and his standard is he wants to marry another virgin is he now an incel no that's voluntarily selib it because you've set
(2:56:39) a standard for yourself kind of interesting I I I might be getting on board with what you're saying Andrew
(2:56:45) because so not exp not even yeah well no I'm
(2:56:50) trying to sus this out in my head I'm thinking about it like okay yeah so uh there is a law stating that essay is
(2:56:57) illegal right so in the if I'm looking at a coming from a Biblical framework as
(2:57:02) a Christian uh I determine that the Bible is my foundation for Morality and
(2:57:07) is how is law in my mind so just the same way that uh essay is legal in I
(2:57:15) mean it's it's illegal in the Bible but it's illegal in our society it is to co-op the uh verbiage
(2:57:22) it is illegal in God's mind in God's eye to say to have sex before marriage right
(2:57:29) so I actually kind of agree so you can't actually alleviate what you want even though you want to because there's this
(2:57:35) barrier but you're choosing to to to abide by the barri but you would be doing the same thing with that's the
(2:57:42) point it's a choice Cho not to does it just end at religious convictions can I say female dating strategy tells me I
(2:57:47) should only guys who make more than me and because I earn a lot it's hard to find those guys they're foring fem cell well the the the relig fast doesn't make
(2:57:53) your arguments it doesn't my arguments being correct arre what's your argument I bet you can't even repeat it I think I
(2:58:00) can do it I was saying why are you just drawing the Bible to be akin to law but why can't I say my preferences could be
(2:58:06) akin to law too so suddenly I'm a fem you could yeah yeah okay so I'm a femel cuz I can't find a guy who makes more
(2:58:11) money than me saying that you could you could make two different categories here right but you would still have to
(2:58:17) categorize them so is it involuntary I guess what we're really discussing is what do we mean by involuntary you think
(2:58:24) that it's voluntary absent barrier and so do I so I don't know where we're arguing okay so far as far as just real
(2:58:30) quick though if you have sa that's a you're going to get a physical repercussion for that you deciding you
(2:58:35) deciding to abide by the Bible you're not going to get a physical rep rep we believe you would yeah that's that's the
(2:58:42) point your belief and ual physical harm happening to you is not the same you're not going to go to jail God is not going
(2:58:49) to put you in jail but you could also let's let's Invision for a second that you knew you could do it and could get
(2:58:54) away with it and not go to jail okay it would still be a barrier the absent
() 
(2:59:00) consent would still be a barrier and so you wouldn't do it the chance of you actually being able to go to jail versus
(2:59:05) not are two different very big things yeah has nothing to do with the point how does it not because what I'm saying is let's remove that for a second that
(2:59:12) you would even you're deciding that the Bible that is the is the top thing that's going you're deciding that the law is the top thing that's prevents the
(2:59:18) not no I'm not I'm just saying as far as overall you can believe in the Bible that's fine but no matter what Bible or
(2:59:24) not you still got to respect the law so you're you're encompassing you don't have to respect the law as far as like
(2:59:29) if you're going to be law-abiding or even just of any laws right so your choice is to respect the law but everyone has to be under the law not
(2:59:35) everyone has to be under the Bible yeah but your choice is to respect both mhm you don't have to respect the law you
(2:59:41) choose to respect the law nothing stopping you from going through stop nothing stopping you from grabbing
(2:59:46) that difference is the repercussions at the end of the day are different yes there might be that there's uh you have
(2:59:52) a perception you saying that you have a perception of a repercussion distinction
(2:59:58) fine we can remove that barrier by saying if we could assume that there was no repercussion for you would you just
(3:00:03) start saying people there is yeah but but that's not the purpose of explaining this this way the purpose is to show you
(3:00:09) that even if that barrier was removed you still wouldn't do it there is a barrier which is is there whether it's
(3:00:15) religious or it's legal these two barriers still very much exist inside of your mind which is the preventative
(3:00:21) measure for doing the action but okay so if you sexually assault someone you're then affecting that person's life if you
(3:00:27) Asain abstain for sex because of a religious belief you're not affecting someone else's life what if you were to
(3:00:33) uh to essay what if you were to essay a chick who was in a who was in a coma who was in a coma and would never know and
(3:00:39) it was impossible for her to get there was a man who was raping a lady in sorry but you wouldn't cosign on it I think we
(3:00:45) actually agree right you wouldn't cosign on it no it's awful right that's my whole point barrier no I think we agree
(3:00:50) I think we agree I was having rebuttal to Brian saying that like oh incels exist only for men but never for women
(3:00:55) because someone will always you and I was saying in theory you could someone as a man but it's not to these you know what I mean there's that
(3:01:01) barrier there so I was saying even for women even though some guys would prob you so here's why I would make the two
(3:01:07) distinct category so I think you would agree with this too so in the distinct category one with the men I think it's
(3:01:13) much easier for men to be in that one category of incel right whereas for
(3:01:19) women it's not very it would actually be difficult to be in that category whereas on the religious end I would say that it
(3:01:26) could be equal so okay what about what about this what about what about this so let's say you have a man and a woman
(3:01:33) neither are religious they're both physically unattractive yeah they want to have they
(3:01:40) don't care about they just want to have sex immediately like that night or
(3:01:45) whatever or within the a short period of time say a week I would argue
(3:01:51) that almost any woman if she was so inclined could get sex whereas it's not
(3:01:56) clear to me if any man could just go out and I agree I totally agree I agree but
(3:02:02) that's typically not what fem cell refers to like I don't think fem cels are actually arguing I can't anybody they're saying I can't
(3:02:07) anybody who would care same way those men in theory those insults could each other but they're not going to be attracted to each other and enjoy it on
(3:02:13) but if definition of fem cell is a female in actually need you to repeat that why you didn't hear her no I I
(3:02:19) didn't she she has Meth mouth you got to talk slow so I can understand what you're saying the reason I talk so fast
(3:02:25) is because I keep getting cut off it's not to try and cut no I know I'm just saying in general but anyways my point
(3:02:30) was yes a a fem cell could get sex from anybody okay but the point was um men in
(3:02:36) theory those incels they could get sex from each other in theory but they won't enjoy it each other yes in theory yeah
(3:02:41) he's talking about the opposite sex no I know but I'm saying the same way a femel might not enjoy having sex or even find
(3:02:47) any like little bit of attraction to the guy who's propositioning her on Reddit those guys won't enjoy having sex with
(3:02:53) each other so that's why I'm saying it's two different metul male female sexuality is incredibly different
(3:02:59) ridiculous you get what I'm saying yeah so let me just let me go ahead I'm sorry no yeah I I was just about to ask so
(3:03:05) does the AC of sex require that there's an there's there's enjoyment in
(3:03:10) it I'm saying fem cell has a slightly different an incel I'm not actually sure
(3:03:16) what that okay well it's involuntarily celibate which means no sex regardless
(3:03:21) of how you feel about it if you enjoy it or not if you're having sex you're not an incel
(3:03:27) right sex as an incel with other no I
(3:03:32) okay so if if you if your goal is to find sex and you are able to find it
(3:03:38) that is by definition not celibate regardless if you enjoy it or not
(3:03:44) yes and like I said you could find it in Nevada but obviously we're talking about certain barriers and guys want it from a
(3:03:50) woman who may enthusiastically consenting and a woman maybe wants it from a guy who isn't just looking at her as a whole so that was my only point I
(3:03:56) don't understand I don't understand why each one of those criticisms couldn't be applied back so you say you say incels
(3:04:01) could have it with each other well so could fem cells yeah so I don't understand how the criticisms wouldn't
(3:04:07) be equal it's not equal and do you agree that fem cells exist even though they could in theory someone and inel
(3:04:14) could in theory someone I would say I would say by this criteria though what he's trying to draw is that when he says
(3:04:20) not exist right be the same way that you and I would say something in the Commons doesn't mean there's none who who exist
(3:04:27) at all on planet Earth but rather if you make the comparison between the amount of male versus female it's
(3:04:33) overwhelmingly going to be male versus female when it comes to this you would agree with that in that category I would
(3:04:39) but you would also agree that male and females look at sex entirely differently so when someone says I'm a fem cell you
(3:04:44) understand that she's not saying nobody will me she's saying nobody maybe I'm having difficulty finding someone who will me and actually ask me my
(3:04:51) name so so okay but if that's the case then they have just changed the meaning from how we mean it so it doesn't mean
(3:04:58) anything yeah I don't think anyone thinks they have identical definitions yeah I know but from our definition you
(3:05:03) would agree we're correct that men have a harder time procing sex yes yeah and that and that
(3:05:09) the incel from our perspective our okay then the fem cell yes okay yeah I
(3:05:17) would agree with that too okay but the same basis of Attraction I because it's
(3:05:22) it's typical Progressive pedantry and you have to like literally peel back all the layers until you get to where you
(3:05:27) need to no it's not it's because we're talking about sex that it's we're talking about sex they wouldn't be disgusted by and like I said the guys
(3:05:33) could in theory each other but they would feel disgusted by that if they're straight and the woman the Fel couldn't the some random like redditor
(3:05:39) proposer but she might not enjoy it that was my point Brian was her he left so I
(3:05:45) had to direct it you okay well okay when I think fem cell like I think female
(3:05:50) incel because I know there's this definition of fem cell where it's like well I'm just not finding the right guy
(3:05:56) that I want to have sex with and to me when I think of Insel it's just somebody who wants to have sex but like can't
(3:06:04) there's not all these strings attached to it there's not all these terms the guy doesn't have to be some magical
(3:06:10) unicorn like I'm sure most men who are incels would be happy to have sex with a woman who's even probably below their
(3:06:17) standards or whatever that might be so all right okay um and I do think when
(3:06:25) it comes to incels first off it's kind of the euphemism treadmill where a word starts to lose its its meaning like Nazi
(3:06:32) and fascist oh yeah where it just ends up being used as a generic insult rather than a word that that has actual meaning
(3:06:40) uh I do think incels they get to they a lot of times they get made fun of I actually think they need empathy
(3:06:46) understanding and compassion not hate and um more isolation because you certainly don't make a scared dog more
(3:06:52) calm by beating him with a a stick and also to your point um you said that it's
(3:06:58) not because of their physical attractiveness but because of their personality uh and perhaps there I've
() 
(3:07:04) seen some insult well let me just finish my point um often times there's this idea that these incels are just uh
(3:07:11) certainly there are men there are women hating incels misogynistic incels absolutely however it's not clear to me
(3:07:17) if misogyny it's not clear to me if misogyny is the cause of their lack of
(3:07:22) sexual connection because there are plenty of misogynistic men who are highly sexually successful I don't think
(3:07:29) it has to be that though it could it could be simple as like I don't like myself oh I mean sure I guess but like
(3:07:36) that also is unattractive I mean I'm sure there's plenty of like some of the most toxic women haters there are are
(3:07:41) probably who act like towards every women or have yeah I'm I'm saying
(3:07:47) like there's probably like more than physical that they're not getting said yes to like it's not going to be just
(3:07:52) physical because the way women work genuinely we fall in love with the inside even if the outside is important
(3:07:59) I mean yeah okay you can you can go for instance you can go to school with someone or go to be at work at someone
(3:08:04) who's definitely not your type and you keep seeing them over and over again you see the cute little jokes and then you kind of start seeing them as being cute
(3:08:10) and funny because their inside made you be like actually like I'm kind of digging that like weird nose thing he does or his ears are a little big but I
(3:08:16) actually kind of like that part about him so we just we we work differently in that way sure and so I would say that it
(3:08:23) wouldn't have to necessarily be a man who hates a woman but it could be like well he could always be talking bad about himself or maybe he's level on the
(3:08:30) Spectrum where he doesn't know how to communicate and like talk to people there's many different things that it could be but I would say that it
(3:08:35) probably has to do more with the inside than just the out yeah I'm actually trying to remember how we got on to that
(3:08:40) cuz I think I was asking you about your celibacy and then roster and you asked about incels you
(3:08:46) said that you were what's the definition of in CU you said recycling bodies yeah oh yeah that's oh great okay all right
(3:08:53) all right um and you were like no no I don't like that language it's I don't like it under the perview of my
(3:08:59) Progressive analysis I don't feel like that that's how people really analyze the situ that type of right I was
(3:09:05) say that's exactly that's exactly there was a Civic word I was avoiding using but I was saying it's like kind of a
(3:09:11) weird way to view romantic relationships how so oh God are we going it's just not
(3:09:16) it's just not romantic wrong with it I just thought it was funny yeah like it's just it was ironic yeah it's just a
(3:09:23) descriptor yeah it's not necessarily wrong it's just kind of depersonalized maybe it was just funny it was how you
(3:09:29) personalized it I think that's negative or positive it's just an observation
(3:09:35) cator oh it's a calculator way of VI okay all right all right good talk all right I have a note here from Kimberly
() 
(3:09:41) uh Kimberly you say I feel like most men want to be taken care of instead of them taking care of the ladies as far as the
(3:09:48) guys I've dated I've always been the one to plan pay for the dates or I've put in too much effort and not the same energy
(3:09:53) in return it's always a what you doing message instead of taking the initiative to plan a date These Guys these guys are
(3:10:02) just honestly kind of childish you got to raise your standards she got to raise her standard she's allowing that's her
(3:10:07) right there oh you you got you got to you got to raise your standards I'm glad you're here you got to you got to stop
(3:10:13) you control that that's why I haven't like been talking to guys recently wait
(3:10:19) so reminder you're you're 22 correct yeah um but you said your longest relationship for was for two years so
(3:10:25) your two two-year relationship is that how that to your relationship looked no
(3:10:32) that one was well it just didn't end well but I don't want to get into that but um what
(3:10:39) I was saying sorry what I was saying is that that's why why I didn't that's why
(3:10:44) I don't MD can you talk to guys anymore your mic wait hold on let me see what's going on here yeah your mic's way too
(3:10:50) shifted it's block your mic Maddie your mic is blocking her goad okay um yeah
(3:10:57) well from the past two relationships that I've been in relationships um one of
(3:11:04) them it went well the thing was that when I met him he was barely coming from
(3:11:11) a different state and he didn't have much here so I helped
(3:11:16) him out in the beginning I had my own car and he would use it and stuff but he ended up cheating on me anyways and up
(3:11:23) Good Times yeah he ended up cheating on me and I found out cuz I went on Facebook oh and he had PO he had he had
(3:11:31) posted a picture and I was going through the liks and I seen some girl had harded
(3:11:36) his picture and um so I clicked on her profile and then I seen a picture of
(3:11:42) them too together on her header so how many how many of the men that you've recently been dating have been you've
(3:11:49) been taking care of them uh you've been paying cuz you said most men want to be
(3:11:54) taken care of and and that you've uh dated men that you're planning dates and
(3:12:00) you're paying for the dates yeah and you put in too much effort so what and that was my also uh the last guy I was
(3:12:07) talking to um basically when I met him he was is leaving his
(3:12:14) BM and BM baby mama okay I didn't know there was like a acronym for so there
(3:12:21) was a lot of drama because she didn't like me and like it I was like it's not
(3:12:26) my fault that he started texting me you know he had told me that they weren't together and they weren't together so I
(3:12:33) so you were paying for him how do you feel about keeping a man who like cheats on his girl for you though no he wasn't
(3:12:38) with her no he wasn't with her when we were talking he wasn't with her um but yeah he would like he had to come to
(3:12:45) Ontario and I live in India so I would be the one coming and going or he would be wait can you show your nails again

(3:13:34) wait did you answer if you've had have you uh roster did you guys answer that
(3:13:39) we did did we go around go check it out shitty memory okay uh all right so you
(3:13:46) also wrote that you feel like I'm kind of both a feminist and traditional yeah because I feel like um
(3:13:55) if I want to have a job like I want to work I want to make my own money but at the same time like I I want to be I if I
(3:14:03) find the right guy I would be at you want stay home stay if I find the right
(3:14:09) person but if not so okay do you want to get married M that's a good question it's cuz before
(3:14:18) I would say yeah but now I'm just like I don't think there's going to like you
(3:14:24) don't think there's a guy who's going to want to marry you or no I just don't think that there's a guy that
(3:14:31) would because I guess I'm picky you're picky yeah um okay you think find a guy
(3:14:38) how are you how are you picky well like I said in the beginning I don't like
(3:14:43) going out to like clubs and stuff so I wouldn't want picky though I don't think that's picky really per but how how else
(3:14:50) are you picky I'm sure there's more than just that we talking looks no I mean did we talk about did
(3:14:57) you say hi thing did you did we go around on that I've dated shorter shorter guys than me well I've not not
(3:15:03) really dated but I've I'm 5'7 okay did you say you have a I forgot if you mention your hyp preference no I don't
(3:15:11) have a hype preference well I've dated shorter guys than me how are you
(3:15:16) picking I I don't know I just I guess
(3:15:23) um I don't know guys when I'm with somebody they just see I asked them for
(3:15:30) stuff and they don't such such as what but it's not really picky huh it's
(3:15:36) just that I was going to ask you do you think you're picky or do you just talking about your standards what are your standards
(3:15:43) cuz there I think there is a difference or do you mean that so far you've met guys and there's been
(3:15:49) something about them that you haven't liked and so you feel like you're picky it's probably that I don't like it
(3:15:56) but they don't think it's a issue so that so they think that I'm picky but
(3:16:01) such as such as what like um when I was with the when I was talking to this one
(3:16:07) guy I would ask him could he not like be following other
(3:16:13) girls on Instagram or liking their pictures while we were talking but he was like oh my mom said that I have to
(3:16:19) explore my options I was like I was like your mom told you you
(3:16:27) had to explore your options I was like okay that's fine but you can go I told
(3:16:34) him that's fine you can go explore his options and I I wasn't expecting the mom told me to was not told me he literally
(3:16:42) said my mom said that I have to explore my options and I you guys laughing
(3:16:48) because you think he made that up or do you think you're of course he made it of you laughing because she probably she
(3:16:54) might have and like he's doing it like what is what is the
(3:16:59) situ funny okay so you're
(3:17:05) regardless a semi uh related question on that topic for the men at the table do
() 
(3:17:10) you guys think that confidence modesty is a more important trait in your dating life from a woman like I'm just and I'm
(3:17:17) genuinely just curious modesty modesty here's I mean
(3:17:22) here's one way to uh perhaps look at this if a girl were to approach me I
(3:17:30) don't know like she wanted to hit on me or something uh not that that might be the best way to go about things but
(3:17:38) uh often times I think women would prefer a guy to step to them in a really confident manner versus like maybe their
(3:17:45) eye contact isn't great or they're a little shy or bashful I would say for me though I would prefer a girl to step to
(3:17:51) me and she's kind of like a little nervous about it than if she was like
(3:17:58) hi a little bit both well it's it's because of she shyly walks up to you I'm
(3:18:03) sure Mason will agree with me on this too so from from like the Christian standpoint we would consider these are
(3:18:11) it's a neutral trait confidence right but we would say that men have it way more than women have it or at least that
(3:18:17) something that is push for men to have right as that sort of trait Society I
(3:18:22) absolutely AG yeah as that sort of trait so we're not looking for masculine traits in women if we were looking are
(3:18:29) you attributing confidence to mascul hang almost done okay I was just sorry yes I'm I'm attributing that as a more
(3:18:36) masculine trait than modesty so okay that's the point right it's not it's
(3:18:42) neutral trait but it's a more masculine trait than modesty is so if you were to talk to you know like uh priests or you
(3:18:48) were to talk to clergy or things like this the things that they have a hard time with men on are things of like
(3:18:54) matters of Pride matters of uh of that type of thing you know what I mean so we
(3:19:00) would we would maybe attribute it more that way too we're not looking for masculine traits in women we're looking for feminine traits in women I guess I
(3:19:07) just don't like gender those types of traits like from my viewpoint it's a neutral I'm just saying you can look at
(3:19:12) both traits though and see which one societ you know that we would attribute towards towards which sex more right
(3:19:19) yeah that's interesting perspective speaking of masculine and feminine you're attracting feminine
(3:19:24) men yeah that that checks out wait do you have a type like what's your type
(3:19:29) white guys Latino guys yeah you don't you wouldn't dat the white guy I mean
(3:19:35) ask for a friend I haven't I would but I never have to beon you've never dated
(3:19:41) leg guy no I've really only dated Mexicans to be honest Mexican guys but that's because that's any black guys in
(3:19:47) there on ja it's because no I've never dated a black no I've never what about
(3:19:55) like Native Americans any native Chumash no no chh
(3:20:00) Mexican Mexican is American you have a Catholic upbringing mhm yeah yeah kind

() 
(3:22:41) that's better yeah yeah yeah what does this mean what does this
(3:22:48) mean yeah so an incel is just like someone who is involuntarily celibate and it just essentially it has morphed
(3:22:55) into its own slang term that's kind of describes that loser sitting on Reddit for 23 hours a day um with cheetah dust
(3:23:04) and empty Mountain Dew cans all around them and it just has a real stank smell
(3:23:09) that is involved with these people because I'm just going to pay you an image and like the Fedora is a little crusty and the the beard the the neck
(3:23:17) beard is strong but the facial hair is weak and there's a B Spot in the back
(3:23:22) and you could just and you can just see the Fedora covered it just dear life and
(3:23:30) he's sitting there mut muttering under his breath about how uh like Jessica Alba's J you that's what you're talking
(3:23:38) about yeah like bottom of the barrel that was a really good description thank
(3:23:43) you just like I just wanted to paint a little word picture for the people at home no that's perf so no because trust me I have met a mini incel and they all
(3:23:50) but most even if they are they can pretend they're a lawyer they can pretend they're a therapist they can
(3:23:55) pretend it's most people that like hate you online behind if you're hiding behind a screen and like and you have
(3:24:01) zero followers and it's a hidden profile I just refer to anyone like that inel inel exactly like they can cosplay that
(3:24:07) in their daytime but that's who they are at heart is that's what you're taking your time to do oh it's pathetic yeah
(3:24:13) okay I could never great great um I love that I did I did just want to want to
(3:24:19) say this one thing if you don't mind right at the end there you said I would never what were you referring to I would
(3:24:27) never behave toward people the way that incels behave toward me cuz it sounded like you were saying I would never like
(3:24:34) I would never sleep with somebody like that that's what it sounded like to me oh no I wasn't referencing like sleeping
(3:24:40) with so I mean I would not want to date an incel correct because the people that have
(3:24:47) been the the the off here did that sound like she was like I would never
(3:24:53) likeone I would never like behave that way that's what intend the whole the
(3:24:58) whole incumbent of but but related to what I already said this whole euphemism treadmill thing I mean even that I don't
(3:25:05) know her name the host of the podcast she said it's D'Or she said it's Insel
(3:25:10) is just a term for anybody that talks  online and has no followers well
(3:25:15) she said the thing with what's wrong with fedoras hello the
(3:25:21) M intern wear it better than anyone clearly lady I mean with the bald spot
(3:25:27) though what's wrong with bald spot I mean look I get roasted all day every day for existing as a fat woman on the
(3:25:33) internet body positivity mean I'm I'm more down with body neutrality but that's just me we
(3:25:39) shouldn't shame men for balding it's natural yeah and does the neck beard at least connect I think she's clapping back to
(3:25:46) what they've already said to her she's this is not like everything look my ti comment YouTube comments just I'm I'm
(3:25:54) allowed to make a joke at their expense once or twice if they dedicate hours of their time to try to tear me down
(3:26:01) because they can't handle seeing someone like me be confident in myself because it makes them question why they can't be
(3:26:07) confident within themselves when they fit in the Americanized standards of C and whatever and I am an outlier I'm
(3:26:15) someone that they wish to be uh not seen nor heard and I put myself out there and
(3:26:21) I hold myself to a standard of what I think is a good human being and yeah so
(3:26:29) how I proceed with that so just just give you a little push back here yes I can agree with a portion of
(3:26:35) what you say the first portion of what you said is if these guys are going to continuously make fun of me right and
(3:26:40) this is the group group it's coming from I'm going to hit back okay that's fair okay but then he kind of moved on into
(3:26:46) this whole but you see what it is is that I don't deserve to have any criticism and this is all projection
(3:26:52) because this is how they really feel not how I am and it's like that's when I go I'm not so criticism is not calling me
(3:26:59) Michelin man it's not calling me gorlock it's not making fun of my body what's not constructive about
() 
(3:27:05) that do you think that that that encour Andrew do you think encourages healthy
(3:27:12) behavior when it feeds into the eating disorder mindset constructive criticism
(3:27:19) the constructive criticism is not for you the constructive criticism it's a shaming tactic so that everybody who
(3:27:26) sees a person like you out there trying to say it's okay and I don't consent to Sham constru I'm trying to tell you not
(3:27:34) constructive it's constructive to all of society to say I'm trying to explain anytime you're ready to let me so anyway
(3:27:41) yeah how this is really important to society as a shaming tactic same way that you might take a politician if you
(3:27:47) were the system for instance and and completely throw him in jail and do all kinds of horrible things to him make an
(3:27:53) example to everybody else that's what shame does hang on a shaming tactic
(3:27:58) that's used in this way is to say listen if anybody else is going to come out and be like you are right and say that
(3:28:05) unapologetically this is this is okay this is good blah blah blah blah blah they're trying to instill a sense of
(3:28:11) shame so that if other women see that they don't go that road and instead try to do something about it so you think
(3:28:17) that my existence is a right to be a political statement toward um other
(3:28:25) people's views of their own body and that I'm to be used you're a public figure that's right you're a public
(3:28:31) figure who goes out and say and I'm an apologetic right I've slept with a with all these guys and I'm that's not my
(3:28:38) platform part of my past but yeah but part of your platform is the whole big beautiful you know not anymore
(3:28:44) do you know my platform do you know my platform at all do you know my story at all here's the thing that's what it is
(3:28:51) right no it's not what is it what is your platform my platform is that I have lived through a lot of experiences that
(3:28:57) have led me to be in this body and to be who I am and that I am on a journey of
(3:29:03) loving myself into my house yeah you're loving yourself there's no excuse for that there's no excuse because there's
(3:29:10) no excuse for it that's why you're getting shamed there's no excuse there's no excuse there's no excuse for what me
(3:29:16) existing no for you to look like that what okay question everything you said could be a byproduct but do you think
(3:29:22) when a guy is saying gorlock the destroyer and when Brian titles the video like that you think he's really doing it to like a shame tactic mitigate
(3:29:28) obesity it's a shame tactic no it's never why you
(3:29:34) got why you got throw me under the bus because you you're the one who titled it that well first off it was it was only
(3:29:40) recently changed and did you do that because you were like I want to mitigate obesity in America was that your it was
(3:29:46) it was for the clicks and theal sensationalizing everybody's searching for the everybody DMS me Brian
(3:29:53) where's the gore which one's the gorlock episode and I'm like I get 20 DMS a day
(3:29:58) Brian I can't because it was titled rage quck EO versus Chase round two there was not the Ali Al wey was not in the
(3:30:05) thumbnail so I just titled it gorlock the Destroyer makes it easier for people to find the video okay okay I made it I
(3:30:12) tried to make it people are wondering Brian where's where's the the the AI
(3:30:17) video I I put in the title so people can find it I'm a nice guy I'm consider I'm trying to save people time okay so it
(3:30:24) could be a byproduct my question is do you actually think that people Andrew like leaving those comments are doing with those intentions or you think it's
(3:30:30) like could you concede there's a little bit of like shot and Freud in there yeah I think that the overwhelming majority I
(3:30:35) wouldn't say all not putting everything in a monolith people who comment hippo trying to finish okay so do I think
(3:30:41) think do I think yeah even that comment I think is legitimate because what's the point the point is to make the
(3:30:46) comparison to this big ginormous animal which you're not right it's a shaming
(3:30:52) tactic the whole goal of it is to tell the person stop the behavior of other people see what you're doing this is bad
(3:30:59) we used to have shame in society it was good it's good to employ shame definitely not good they did a study I'm
(3:31:05) so sorry but they oh they did a study what was the methodology in the study they um it's on I think it's on Netflix
(3:31:11) ology can I just finish my I just want you to tell me the methodology I'm going tell you my statement first they did a statement never even read the study you
(3:31:16) don't know anything about the study that humans actually respond better to positive affirmations and positive
(3:31:22) encouragement rather than was the methodology for what was positive in the study um they were doing like they did a
(3:31:27) um a study of like it was like a 100 humans or whatever I yeah what was the methodology for what they considered
(3:31:33) positive in the study they they had people up on stage and they like had them do a task and to some of them they
(3:31:39) told them they did a really good job and to the next group they told them they did a really bad job and then next time they had that that same group study come
(3:31:44) in and they encourag them to do one thing and they they've done so many of this where they encourage one and they
(3:31:49) and don't encourage the other and the ones that they haven't encouraged after they bring them back to do the exact same thing the ones that have been
(3:31:55) encouraged those past two times Excel and the ones that have not do not theyve done plenty of studies on that well
(3:32:01) you're saying wait humans Thrive better from positive from like all right let's move onour I'm here I'm going to read
(3:32:08) some chats I'm going to read some chats all right Andrew and Fara have the highest IQs out of everyone on the show
(3:32:13) and their philosophy debates are pretty interesting would would be cool to see far back on The Crucible for another long formed debate did what was the wait
(3:32:21) hold on I'm going to save it for later but what was the big thing that you guys it was about rights women's suffrage oh
(3:32:26) was that women's rights yeah women's rights is that is that a to thing you think I there's nothing in violation of
(3:32:34) to for that okay may can I make one more point about the conversation we just had I'll keep it really short but I'm going
() 
(3:32:40) to move on right right after you say it so go ahead okay so do you think that like you're saying cuz they're calling them fat or Hippo the goal is that they
(3:32:46) can actually change that behavior so it's beneficial but what about the guys who leave certain comments just calling a girl ugly and it's not related to
(3:32:52) things she can change like I feel like they stem from the same place which is why I was saying I feel like the intention tends to just be sadism yeah
(3:32:58) there's I think there's some of that yeah okay cool all right we have Bender the offender ladies do you think mandatory paternity testing would hurt
(3:33:05) or help women in today's society do you want to stay for this just this question and then
(3:33:11) I had like three Red Bulls okay do give you wings ladies do
(3:33:16) you think mandatory paternity testing would hurt or help women in today's
(3:33:24) society I don't know I feel like that's such a broad question because I feel
(3:33:29) like in some ways it could be harmful but in other ways I think overall it would be
(3:33:35) helpful in terms of you know child support and knowing it but it's it's
(3:33:40) like that's odd because it's like what's the circumstances it just like for every birth there's a paternity test yeah yeah
(3:33:47) yeah in what ways would that be harmful yeah I was going to ask like because like if like the person is an abuser
(3:33:54) someone who's like you know doesn't necessarily they don't want to be tied to the person well I mean if it's that
(3:34:01) person but do you have a right to hide paternity based on the fact that the other person's
(3:34:07) abusive I mean I would want to do anything to get out of situation I do just because if
(3:34:14) you're abusive to me what would you do with the child yeah that doesn't okay listen you don't have a right to hide
(3:34:22) the paternity from a father based upon whatever your analysises of abuse I've
(3:34:28) heard things as as ridiculous as this emotionally abusive which means nothing
(3:34:34) it means nothing that's crazy no it's not no it's not crazy it's not emotional
(3:34:39) abuse is nothing yeah it means nothing it's a subjective analysis it's subjective interes that's an interesting
(3:34:47) well listen it's it is subjective give me an objective stand for em subjective in the terms of psychology at all yeah
(3:34:52) it is most subjective psychology exactly exactly it's a subjective analysis so so
(3:34:58) like let me give you an example I can give you a really easy one okay let's say that you're going out and you're
(3:35:04) overspending from my perspective like let's say married to a woman I say listen you're overspending okay okay and
(3:35:11) you say well listen I really need to spend this because I need X Y and Z for the household you think the paper towel
(3:35:17) holder and this and that is very important maybe it is maybe it is important and I think it isn't so I go
(3:35:23) and I cut off your access to that threshold of money and give you a lesser threshold of money that I think is
(3:35:29) appropriate and you don't think is appropriate is that
(3:35:36) abuse in that specific scenario there there's just like several factors to whether or not something is
(3:35:42) or isn't financial abuse because it's subjective that's why and it's
(3:35:48) predicated on how the woman feels about hold because hold on hold on go ahead and it's predicated on how the woman
(3:35:54) feels about what you say like a lot of women just don't take kindly to being criticized at all they don't take kindly
(3:36:00) to a guy even if a guy gets moderately upset and he raises his tone a little bit you have women who will consider
(3:36:05) that emotional abuse that's not I don't but I mean to me emotional abuse is like verbal like verbally saying really
(3:36:12) degrading horrible things and like a a systemic thing over a a systemic thing
(3:36:17) over time excuse me and so I mean maybe I didn't initially understand
(3:36:23) the point you were trying to make with the suggestive because the subject sub sorry I'm stuttering really bad right
(3:36:29) now um but in terms of emotional abuse being a factor I
(3:36:35) think is important though it is suggestive subjective thank you subjective
(3:36:41) even though it is subjective it is something that I mean has has longing effects on
(3:36:47) both parent and child but when my initial point I was thinking more so abuse of the other aspects cuz emotional
(3:36:57) is it is impactful but it's not as dangerous to like the health of the child versus the other one so let's
(3:37:03) let's move into okay if you fair enough you say okay when it comes to this it's subjective so maybe we wouldn't hide
(3:37:08) paternity on that but if we move over to physical abuse let's say right you think that that's cut and dry well what if uh
(3:37:15) this guy he's convicted of uh physically abusing the mom then shouldn't we be able to hide paternity she says yeah I
(3:37:22) say I still say no and here's why because plenty of people get accused of uh doing domestic violence or doing
(3:37:29) things like this and they haven't actually done it and so we're going to yield to the word of the woman in this
(3:37:34) case and hide the paternity of that man's child for something which could easily be a falsehood that's immoral to
(3:37:41) the utmost in in my worldview okay and I see that but for me it's like if you're
(3:37:47) talking about a mandated paternity test then at that point that's the government getting involved in between the relationship and the personal affairs of
(3:37:54) people and I am the kind of person that prefers to step off of unnecessary like
(3:38:00) government a communist you want the government involved in the LI that literally every single aspect hell said
(3:38:07) I was a communist when earlier no you I was talking about capitalism and you
(3:38:12) said the word communism when that word never left my mouth so socialism I mean first I'm not really here to debate to
(3:38:19) politics I'm just asking this I can't talk about are you a socialist um I mean I consider myself a leftist okay yeah
(3:38:25) you don't care if governments involved in your life for all kinds of stuff what did you care if the government was involved in my life when there was
(3:38:31) certain mandates going on around you didn't give a but now suddenly you care about now suddenly you care about I
(3:38:38) can't get into that but you know what I'm saying yeah okay I do now yes but um wait I have a question you said you when
(3:38:45) it comes to you wouldn't want the government involved with mandatory paternity test over people's autonomy but let me ask you a question let's say
(3:38:51) do you want kids one day no oh okay so this is honestly for me this is just
(3:38:56) like a thing that I don't really want to do I mean that was kind of an move but let's let's keep that was a
(3:39:03) real move yeah let's keep it nice guys let's keep it nice okay because some people are smart enough to know what's best for them and for me my
(3:39:10) life okay I don't want to have children just let me ask the question okay but I would if I wanted to be a good mother
(3:39:17) okay so my question is though do you think you you said you wouldn't want the government involved when it comes to
(3:39:23) paternity testing whatever uh so are you not in favor
(3:39:28) of Child Support women receiving child support for example so I believe that
(3:39:35) whoever has the child should have support from the other partner regardless of their
(3:39:42) gender I think that if a single father has the full custody of the child which
(3:39:49) enforced by which is enforced by the the the courts the state govern you said you
(3:39:55) don't want the government involved with mandatory paternity testing so I'm just confused but well I mean look the
(3:40:00) government has its role all right the government has its role and I don't I
(3:40:06) mean at the end of the day but you do realize that like for example in a a uh child support dispute that the
(3:40:13) government would actually require if there if the the man dis basis but when
(3:40:19) you're putting in a mandated paternity test then that is adding a complicated layer of paperwork and testing it's just
(3:40:25) literally as it's you're already in the hospital you're it's actually the perfect scenario
(3:40:33) to their questions is like does that apply to married couples or couples that are still together or are we okay yeah
(3:40:39) everybody anyways here let's just go around the table anybody can answer this um do you think mandatory paternity
(3:40:45) testing would hurt or help women in today's society would mandatory paternity test
(3:40:51) hurt or help women in today's society be good that's one of the super chat
(3:40:56) questions I don't know okay I mean I don't have any children
(3:41:03) but I don't see why it would be a problem okay Madison I feel like with the way
(3:41:11) not all women but a lot like a majority of women are moving nowadays like it it
(3:41:16) could be very harmful to their children and the man what would be harmful paternity
(3:41:23) testing like if they found out the child's dad was not the guy that she was
(3:41:28) with like that would be breaking their family apart that's a from from a
(3:41:34) mandatory place I I mean I see your point I see your point I don't what about the truth no I think the truth is
(3:41:41) great I think yeah no absolutely everyone should know the truth but I think it's going to be terrible for the children if the truth is Reve favor are
(3:41:49) favor of with the way a lot of women are moving nowadays they're Pro like a lot of children aren't going to be having
(3:41:54) dads anymore so it would be it would be bad for women but you don't object to paternity testing no not at all I'm for
(3:42:00) it so you acknowledge okay I see I see I see are you are you in favor of that injury it sounds like oh yeah yeah I
(3:42:06) think that the the rates of paternity which which are lied about is wildly
(3:42:13) understated wildly understated and uh yeah absolutely I
(3:42:18) think that if mandatory paternity testing was done there would be there would be significant problems for women
(3:42:25) but the kind of problems that I think they should see which is responsibility we for forever forever inside of human
(3:42:32) society men did not have this we' never had the luxury of being a we had to
(3:42:38) always take the word of the woman at as to paternity we don't have to do that now and we absolutely shouldn't do it
(3:42:44) now and even if it's not mandatory everybody should get one no matter what
(3:42:50) always period and and just and and I have aund I look I have what I would
(3:42:57) consider 100% faith and trust in my wife but I told her I told her these words exactly you're going to get the
(3:43:04) test and if not I'm out the door period well also there are that's not emotional abuse well they're also AB that would be
(3:43:11) considered emotional abuse exactly was that 100% trust and Fai I mean it's your prerogative to do that but okay well
(3:43:16) it's not for her it's for me yeah well it's also there are also cases where like the hospital will jumble up babies
(3:43:22) no it's not it's as much trust as I can give of trust it's as much trust as I can give yes because you can't confirm
(3:43:27) that to something that's not trust well what where's the trust back the other way just being like okay yeah no problem
(3:43:34) wait Andrew there's if it was ever any resist that's how that works that's how trust Works what what is the like what
(3:43:40) what's the pitch to like how would you say that cuz I feel like if I would were
(3:43:46) to say that to to a girl I could see her like my wife or when I'm having kids what could she paternity test
(3:43:53) what possible argument could a woman have towards asking you to get a
(3:43:59) paternity test other than it makes her feel bad she's Unfaithful or like you don't trust other than it makes her feel
(3:44:04) bad what could the argument possibly be give me a single argument then cuz it
(3:44:10) makes me feel bad I want to hear it but why would you want to make her so that's I feel bad if you're worried that she'd be cheating on you why would you even
(3:44:16) want to Rel that's I feel bad it's I feel bad saying clearly we don't have a strong Foundation sorry that's I feel bad no it's not it's saying we don't
(3:44:22) have a strong Foundation why would that matter if it didn't make one of them feel bad because she could say like if we don't have a strong Foundation of
(3:44:28) trust and Fa because she makes her feel bad she feel neutral about it and still be like oh wait a going maybe he's going
(3:44:35) to be con if she feels neutral about it if she feels neutral about it I have to talk neutral about let her finish her
(3:44:41) Point say your point if they feel if she feels neutral about it then who cares I'm saying if you don't have trust
(3:44:47) in a relationship typically that will lead to a bad relationship regardless if the part is in the relationship feel bad about it or not that was my only Point
(3:44:54) yeah but that's the only argument is feel bad no it's not I literally said it doesn't matter if they feel bad or not she can and say clearly we don't have a
(3:45:00) strong Foundation donated $200 love your hair Maddie G with your
(3:45:06) marriage Brian love the Andrew Marathon shout out Crucible far my wife KTX okay thanks yo
(3:45:16) bone man thank you man appreciate it welcome uh good to see you back in the chat man go ahead far with your uh point
(3:45:21) I completed it yeah so oh she completed it the the only reason that the trust variable is there is because it would
(3:45:27) make one feel bad over the other that's it so the only argument you would make for the trust is you don't trust me and
(3:45:33) that what far you don't trust me and that makes me but it doesn't have to make you feel bad why would it matter
(3:45:40) basis of a relationship Foundation relationship if it's not and why is it a foundation what about this it's based on
(3:45:45) how you don't care or not you're completely apathetic to whether your wife cheats on you but maybe you still don't want her to do that even if you
(3:45:51) have no emotional reaction to it because you think that creates a unstable foundation for a relationship even if
(3:45:56) you're completely apathetic and maybe you're a cuck and you get off why would you care about the paternity test how would that be an argument if it's just a
(3:46:01) neutral you were saying what is an objection to your boyfriend asking you for
(3:46:07) paternity test and I'm saying you could say we're missing a important tenant of our relationship an important pillar that isn't contingent on me feeling good
(3:46:13) or bad about it that was my only point then if you don't feel good or bad about it why would it be an important pillar
(3:46:19) same way I told you maybe if your wife's cheating on you but you don't necessarily care wouldn't you agree that that could have adverse effects on the
(3:46:25) relationship regardless how you feel about it personally those those would be like the adverse effects that you would
(3:46:30) be talking about of like her getting pregnant no not necessarily her getting you even if she was infertile her giving
(3:46:38) you VD what is that venial disease I don't think those would be your only
(3:46:43) objections to stepping out how that makes you feel then I don't understand you're religious from your Christian
(3:46:49) perview you could probably outline a plethora of reasons for why you wouldn't want your girlfriend or wife to be sleeping with other people other than it
(3:46:54) makes you feel bad you'd probably think it you know has adverse outcom that's true I could appeal to an objective standard yes yes and most people in
(3:47:01) relationship what objective standard are you appealing to usually the tenants of trust in a relationship that's not an objective standard it's a subjective
(3:47:08) standard most relationship subscribe to that obviously people can deviate from that but but that's a that's a
(3:47:13) subjective standard at the end of the day the only reason you appeal to that subjective standard is because if I don't trust you and you don't trust me
(3:47:18) one of us feels bad I just told you there's many instances where you might not feel bad single one of those that
(3:47:23) doesn't really boil down to it made the other person feel bad and so and pin and feel bad he just disagrees no you even
(3:47:29) created a hypothetical neutral so you said hypothetically what if neutrally it didn't make you feel bad for your wife
(3:47:35) to go out and do this thing what would be her objection okay what if I found out my husband cheated on me and I I genuinely have zero emotional reaction
(3:47:41) to it but I still want to dump him did I dump him because it makes me feel bad or because I feel like we don't have a
(3:47:46) strong Foundation because there's just honesty and there's a lack of trust why would I don't understand why do you want
(3:47:52) this the honesty and the trust inside of the relationship if you don't care if he
(3:47:58) cheats to be it's not about don't care I can care without it making me feel bad yeah but okay so you you care but it
(3:48:04) doesn't make you feel bad that could happen yeah how you can't control emal
(3:48:10) response to something maybe you find out someone cheats on you or you found out your husband you know texted another girl and you're like okay this violates
(3:48:15) my care because boundaries it makes you feel bad people have boundaries that aren't always directly purely correlated
(3:48:21) to their feelings about it oh really so if guy is texting and you don't care
(3:48:27) that means it's not about don't care it maybe doesn't make me feel bad oh if it doesn't make you feel bad then you don't care right I don't agree with that you
(3:48:34) don't no so you care if a guy's texting another person even if it doesn't make you feel bad I would still care even if
(3:48:40) in that moment I felt apathetic about it I would still end the relationship even if I personally didn't cry about it even
(3:48:45) even though you didn't care even if I didn't cry about it or why would why would you do anything at all if you didn't care right that makes no sense
() 
(3:48:53) that's the stupidest thing I've heard out of you tonight why would you do anything if you didn't care because
(3:48:59) reversely I wouldn't set boundaries purely based on how I feel about it so for instance if I was overly jealous about my husband having a female
(3:49:05) coworker I wouldn't then say quit your job because this makes me feel bad so it goes both that's something you care about yes it's both ways I I get what
(3:49:12) you're saying but hypothetically you're hypothetically what you're saying is you can have values without having emotion
(3:49:19) tied to those values and and typically they are correlated but not always so
(3:49:24) same way I can you know value honesty and trust and maybe I have a visceral reaction and you having a female cooworker and that could be irrational
(3:49:30) so I'm not going to deduce my boundaries from my emotions and likewise I'm not going to always where does that happen though where where does that actually
(3:49:36) happen especially in the context of a relationship having a female coworker well the distin is feel irrationally
(3:49:42) jealous about my husband having a female coworker it happens every day the distinction here is care in the what so what you're doing rationally sorry go
(3:49:48) ahead man sorry what you said irrationally you feeling that was my whole point I can have rational boundaries and standards that don't
(3:49:54) always correlate to whether I feel good or bad because people feel bad all the time about things that are irrational such as your husband having a female
(3:50:00) cooworker yes so I would then say don't do this thing because it doesn't make because it makes me feel bad so that was my whole point yes you you can I'm
(3:50:07) saying you can't in this context so with the problem that you made with this particular hypothetical when you reverse
(3:50:12) it you introduce care and I'm saying fine you can introduce care it works in that hypothetical the opposition hypothetical doesn't because I'm
(3:50:19) claiming that any of the standards that you would appeal to for why you would not take that test are going to appeal
(3:50:24) to care and therefore feel bad I disagree and I already laid it out nope you gave me a hypothetical where you
(3:50:31) just reintroduced the word care again and said in this case if I did care then
(3:50:36) blah blah are I was saying people set boundaries in Rel relationships that are completely dispar from whether they feel
(3:50:41) good or bad so same way again I may feel bad if my husband has a female coworker I'm not going to then say you can only
(3:50:47) work with men or you can only go to an all male gym yes and likewise I might say don't text other girls and don't
(3:50:53) text with other girls but whether I break up with you isn't going to be contingent on whether when I find out I cry about it or not no no
(3:50:59) no feel disect disrespect is maybe the varable here yeah before you even cry
(3:51:05) about it why did you set the standard to begin with because of certain values in the relationship because things you care
(3:51:11) about that's what I was saying care about but not feel good or bad you said whether it hurts her feelings why do you
(3:51:17) how could you care about it if you don't feel good or bad about it I just explained how no you really didn't in this context that doesn't work why would
(3:51:23) you set the standards if you didn't care about the standards because you felt good or bad about the standard because I can think there's certain shut up I can
(3:51:30) think there's certain pillars sorry I think I could think there's certain pillars that breed a stronger
(3:51:36) relationship regardless of whether or not I personally feel good or bad about it I know you agree with that then why do you care about the stronger pillar
(3:51:43) cuz I want a strong relationship because you care about it and you'll feel good because you valued the relationship you
(3:51:49) wanted to have because you care about it I didn't say care wasn't a variable I said feeling good or bad I'm saying you
(3:51:55) can't have the feel good or bad if you care about something you have to have the feel good or bad I gave you an
(3:52:00) example in which you don't that doesn't have to be the case with the c you actually didn't what you do in that example is you just say yes in that
(3:52:06) casee for care I do feel good or bad and then I set reasonable boundaries but no I said you don't you don't deduce the
(3:52:12) boundaries from feeling good or bad I think you do Nobody Does that everyone does that everybody does every jealous
(3:52:19) every jealous wife says you can't work with other women no no no but the reason that they would say that or not say that
(3:52:26) is because they care about it and so therefore the the fact that they care about it is why they set the boundary
(3:52:33) for good or it makes me feel good or makes me feel bad cuz I care about it yeah the emotion because still feel bad
(3:52:38) about about it but they still let their husband work with other women because they realize they're not have do mean they feel bad about it the reason they
(3:52:45) they could still feel bad about it and allow it but they still feel bad I know you see my point and I'm saying that from your perspective in this particular
(3:52:52) case why shouldn't a man or why shouldn't a woman take the paternity test if a man asks her to other than I
(3:53:00) feel bad that you asked me to do that and I told you why her feelings are irregardless of the fact that maybe she
(3:53:06) wants have a strong pillar of having trust faith in the relationship same way maybe I don't
(3:53:11) personally feel good or bad if my boyfriend says share your location with me but maybe I'll say like okay but if you don't trust me then this probably
(3:53:17) isn't going to be like a sustained relationship for a long period of time and okay the the word trust there doing
(3:53:24) a lot of heavy lifting for your point so I feel like I feel like you would meish
(3:53:31) I just you I want to say I didn't I'm not even disputing the fact or like the sorry of requesting um a paternity test
(3:53:37) you were just asking what are some other obje yeah it's your prog but even in that even in that you're using the word
(3:53:43) trust there it's doing a lot of heavy lifting for your argument am I to assume that you care about trust then mhm yes I
(3:53:50) never on a variable I said feeling good or bad stop stop why would you care
(3:53:56) about the trust why would you care about the trust because having a strong sense of trust in a relationship leads to a
(3:54:02) healthier relationship regardless of whether I feel good or bad so even though I may feel bad about the fact that my husband has a female coworker if
(3:54:08) if I have a strong sense of trust that takes precedence over my feelings of good or bad yeah okay forget the the
(3:54:14) absent analogy inside of your relationship without qualifiers right
(3:54:19) without going just like just ask answer the single question that's so funny Brian just answer the single no Brian
(3:54:25) tell me what's so funny I no far answer the single just answer the single question trust inside of this
(3:54:34) hypothetical okay inside of your own hypothetical the paternity one or the the paternity one which is doing all the heavy lifting
(3:54:40) here the word trust there implies you care we agree right that you care about
(3:54:46) trust yeah yes and and do you care about the trust because if you can't trust the
(3:54:52) other person right it would elicit a negative feeling in you no no okay wow
(3:54:59) and there's nothing I can do nothing he can do there's nothing what do you mean w it doesn't make it it doesn't make
(3:55:04) sense it literally does it doesn't it doesn't make sense it it doesn't it doesn't make sense cuz psychologically
(3:55:10) that's just not how strong healthy relationship don't you feel good yes and
(3:55:15) I'm saying you could have a strong healthy relationship and still get feelings of jealousy that have nothing to do with whether you trust the person
(3:55:20) or not yeah but you but people get jealous if like a waiter hits on their husband even if they know their husband will never in a million years sleep with
(3:55:27) that waiter it doesn't make yeah but all that is aner by the feelings yeah well I mean you're all missing my point okay
(3:55:34) we're all missing my point you we're sorry you just came in and started laughing at him as if you understood anything we not we not yeah it is it is
(3:55:41) because at the end of the day anything that involves two people being together is going to be predicated on emotion regardless regardless I think no matter
(3:55:48) what happens like there is a negative or positive response and you have the I see
(3:55:53) I think you do have the choice the argument for me Brian I think you do have the choice whether you're going to express that or not yeah like you
(3:56:00) internally you're going to have a positive or negative you're going to have a physiological maybe you won't express it
(3:56:06) tell me anything you deduced from that just what do you mean I'm I'm Focus I you know come in and laugh but far was
(3:56:13) that the distinction you was making not like they feel it but they don't act on it or
(3:56:19) like you can feel jealousy typically people create boundaries in the relationship that are completely despit
(3:56:25) from how they feel cuz I might feel jealousy towards my husband even being around another woman but I'm never going to actually realistically ask him to
(3:56:31) work in an all male office so likewise I may feel offended or I may care about
(3:56:36) the fact that we don't have trust in a relationship without it making me necessarily feel bad cuz that was all in response to him saying what would be the
(3:56:42) only objection to asking for a paternity test other than it makes my wife feel bad and I said she might recognize that there's a lack of trust in the
(3:56:48) relationship which is a necessary pillar for a long healthy relationship yeah I don't I don't I don't think that's okay
(3:56:54) so possible move on yeah well I got a question here first we got a chat here
(3:57:00) from Lam dis sky thank you for the Canadian 100 man thank you appreciate it
(3:57:05) preferences are not aching to law like religion because we believe that God holds us accountable to his laws your
(3:57:11) preferences are not enforced by an external entity and are ultimately within your control Andrew I respect
(3:57:16) your conviction unfort bro I always okay I I'll wait till he's back here we have another chat though while we wait for
() 
(3:57:23) Andrew to come back Stiffler ask everyone to rate their looks on a scale
(3:57:29) of one to 10 their looks physical looks scale 1 to 10 we'll start with you we'll
(3:57:35) go around the table go ahead eight today 8.5 8
(3:57:41) 8.5 I'm a 10
(3:57:48) seven eight 6.5 uh I'd say 7.58
(3:57:55) four is that that's lower than last time I I used to say six I'm a five in front
(3:58:00) of all these beautiful women how could I ever not humble myself down to a four
(3:58:07) really proud of you Andrew yeah took guts I'm a
(3:58:12) five I give myself a five so wait eight 8.5 10 seven eight okay all right Brian you
(3:58:21) rated yourself lower than usual yeah I've dropped I've been six and a half
(3:58:27) see now that's humble yeah that's humility that's humble that's humility right that's the thing that's
(3:58:34) usually harder for men to do just just just say it just point it
(3:58:39) I've noticed a pattern here I think men tend to fairly accurately self assess their own level of physical
(3:58:44) attractiveness whereas I've heard more self-esteem
(3:58:50) issues than women do what's that I've heard men have more self-esteem issues than women do I feel like I disagree a
(3:58:57) little bit why would you say that just and I also heard that they're also more emotional um are they who have you heard
(3:59:03) these things yeah because well I mean you guys will act off based off pride and that is going to be like an emotion thing um not necessarily logic do you
(3:59:10) think men or women have more cosmetic surgery I think probably women yeah
(3:59:15) probably women do you think that that's because they have way more self-esteem than men
(3:59:21) I don't think that necessarily what I'm talking about is the same thing I just mean well I think it is symmetric well
(3:59:27) for instance for instance you just rated your shelf a four right and and maybe people may not agree with you and I just
(3:59:32) red myself a 10 and people may not agree with me right but we're just talking about simple our self-esteem my self-esteem is clearly higher no I'm not
(3:59:39) sure that we are I think that what we're talking about is value judgment and I think that I'm making a way better value
(3:59:44) judgment than the value judgment that you're making so the value judgment that I'm making is this I'm old and I'm
(3:59:50) married and I'm out of shape and I smoke right and I'm not a very pleasant person to be around for long periods of time
(3:59:56) especially for the opposite sex like I know all of these things about myself so my value judgment overall is a four tell
(4:00:04) me the value judgment of how you came to a 10 oh yeah um I just think that in general we should think that we are
(4:00:11) great right so you just decided it with there's no value judgment there you just decided it yeah he asked me what I would
(4:00:17) rap myself and because it's my opinion about myself I am took a long time for
(4:00:23) me to love myself and I do now and so yeah I think that like you know I'm I'm my I'm a misty
(4:00:29) 10 I have a question for you wait hold on just one sec um do you think you're
() 
(4:00:34) 75 I said eight oh yeah get it right did you how did you come to that value
(4:00:40) judgment because I don't put within my value within a rig a rigidity a rigidity
(4:00:46) that's not the right word rigidity rigidity um I don't put that within that rigidity of certain I guess value
(4:00:54) judgments more subjective opinions about what value is because I know my value I
(4:01:03) know my worth and I know my beauty that I hold with Within Myself for myself and
(4:01:10) that is appreciated by other people because at the end of the day beauty is
(4:01:15) subjective and it is absolutely within my right to hold myself to a higher
(4:01:22) value and how I conduct myself in the world around me yeah but the when you're talking about the value judgment here my
(4:01:27) wife I'm sure that she has a way higher value judgment of me than I have of me I would agree that she probably should
(4:01:34) from her subjective assessment she probably thinks I'm a great provider she thinks I'm a great father she thinks I take care of all my responsibilities and
(4:01:40) duties she can 100% trust me um so she probably has this really high value
(4:01:46) judgment of me but when I'm doing an actual assessment of me like Andrew
(4:01:51) Wilson the person and my looks and how it's reflected outwards to other people
(4:01:57) right I'm adding this value this value this value this value this value like a mathematical formula to come up with
(4:02:04) that equals four what are you doing to come up with that other than then I just
(4:02:09) think that we should have high self-esteem so that we cuz I just think so because I know I'm a good person
(4:02:15) because frankly if we want to get aesthetic I don't have a busted face I'm fat and if people want to reduce my
(4:02:22) value because of my fatness that's not my problem and that is not the um ideology I hold for myself um I am
(4:02:31) someone who is pursuing weight loss not for Aesthetics not for looks but for my health and it is something I'm moving
(4:02:37) forward forward with because I have been for the past 2 to 3 years now working on
(4:02:44) my selflove and loving myself into a place to care enough about myself to
(4:02:50) take my health back into control when I was being consistently shamed when I was gang stocked on r/ fat people hate in
(4:02:57) 2015 when I have I'm still speaking looks it I'm still speaking it works
(4:03:04) because you're going to change you're really great at overt talking and being disrespectful and i' love the opportunity to get my point across okay
(4:03:10) but the just just to cut in here a little bit the original question was rate your looks cuz you mentioned your
(4:03:16) personality you have a great personality or whatever it is and I and like I said my fatness doesn't devalue me why so I'm
(4:03:22) an a why doesn't it because I think that fat can be it's my assessment of my
(4:03:30) looks right yeah but why why is it that your own assessment of your looks has nothing to do with how the external
(4:03:36) World perceives you that's my don't give a CU you don't care so there's no real value Jud I don't care about other
(4:03:43) people's opinion of me it's not more important than opinion I myself and if you don't if you don't live that way
(4:03:48) that sucks for you if there's a value judgment of how you would self assess your own looks the only possible
(4:03:54) conceivable metric I could even think of would be the perception of how other people view you for your value judgment
(4:04:02) I was in a relationship for almost 8 years with someone who thought my body he had everen that was for and he
(4:04:10) had told me that those the more often than not go ahead he had told me that more often can you speak certain yeah he
(4:04:17) had told me that more often than not I have been pursued by many men who think I am gorgeous and beautiful that
(4:04:23) perception exists whether you have it or not okay so assume for a second I can
(4:04:29) assume inside of like I can Envision a world where you're the only human being who's inside of the world and guess what
(4:04:34) I'll never be the only one who thinks I'm hot and I know that bugs the if you're the only human being who's inside
(4:04:40) of a world I can perceive I can perceive that I can come up with whatever metric I want for myself because I have nothing
(4:04:47) to compare it to so if I have nothing to compare it to and I have nobody else's value judgment then I can say I'm the
(4:04:54) most beautiful person who's ever lived and I would that would be true but if I have the value judgment of hundreds of
(4:05:01) millions of people to compare the standard to and I know that I'm below that threshold and just decide that I'm
(4:05:06) above that threshold anyway not Bas on anything objective you're just making  up ask us our opinion so yes it was
(4:05:14) a madeup opinion from us yeah it is for sure way overstated that was the point
(4:05:20) the only person who does not happy your perception of your truth is not the same for myself or or anyone else yeah what
(4:05:26) is I mean what is truth in a world that and what societal standards in what country I must in every country on
(4:05:34) planet Earth she's not an eight you're ridiculous ridiculous in different places different people
(4:05:39) like different things yeah he's so combative bro it's wild he gets very upset
(4:05:45) and do you know what reality is that is the bottom line here and I've been respectful for how many it's not
(4:05:50) disrespectful I'm just telling you what's true oh what was what was the about me being a mother bro the energy
(4:05:55) you put towards it that I'm not I'm not going to I have been taking it respectfully for hours
(4:06:02) now but to be fair also it's interesting to claim to be so religious and so close to Jesus and be so NE
(4:06:08) to tell the truth no I'm just saying just to be what would Jesus do he'd be like you're a tense
(4:06:13) sweee the other I he would love me as one of God's children he would know that
(4:06:19) if my and my life know you're F whether he loves and you know what being fat is
(4:06:25) not bad it's embarrassing though to claim the religion you have how negative how negative you just crazy
(4:06:31) there's going to be other people who are going to be like I don't claim this because it's like this is part of the reason why you're you're hypocritical hpoc climing to love and be this one big
(4:06:39) thing and then to be so negative instead of encouraging or say even anything in actually
(4:06:45) neighbor constructive way you kind of just get pink and start yelling the only way the only way yeah he gets real like
(4:06:52) the only way that I can get get a word in when you shrill harpies or screeching is for me to talk loudly oh no you I
(4:06:59) mean you're really great at over talking as one of your well I have to cut into cut down the prattle that's true push
(4:07:05) back on pink after all of this I'm a terrible moderator okay I'm a I'm
(4:07:11) a dog moderator okay hold on let me just come in really quick let me just come in all
(4:07:17) right put your put your swords away for just a sec the views expressed by the panelists do not necessarily reflect the
(4:07:26) views of me or the whatever podcast now uh you
(4:07:32) said Okay I I have a question for you I have a question for you what do you I think you said women should view
(4:07:39) themselves better not just women people in general in general but so do you think all women should view themselves
(4:07:45) as tense I would love them to yes and not because everyone also agrees with them let me ask you a question are all
(4:07:51) women tens I have I'm I'm attracted to men no I'm not saying whether you're attracted to them but I'm sure you I'm
(4:07:58) sure you can recognize a beautiful like a beautiful woman perceptive but do you think all women are tens in their own
(4:08:04) right for sure what not sure what that means but okay uh are all men tens in
(4:08:09) their own right for sure no but do you think all men are tens in their own right for sure in their I don't really
() 
(4:08:15) understand in their own right appreciate things just I can appreciate things that I'm not necessarily attracted to does
(4:08:21) that make sense but do okay do you think so in your eye are all men tens like
(4:08:26) just aesthetically so just by looks I beut and women okay so wom because I
(4:08:34) know that someone thinks they're a 10 in my mind mind that's good enough to be
(4:08:39) part of the 10 yes are would I necessarily date them maybe not but as far as like believing their 10 I know
(4:08:46) for instance is ice cream bad just because someone doesn't like the ice cream no everyone's going to have their different opinion of it and so the fact
(4:08:52) that someone likes green mint ice cream for me it might not be my P but does it make it bad ice cream no it could still
(4:08:58) be good ice cream so for that person I don't maybe they're not necessarily if would I date them but do I believe they
(4:09:04) should think they are a 10 is what I said earlier yes I believe they should think they are 10 I okay I just I think
(4:09:10) they I think all people should love themselves we asked a question way Su so much to not love yourself inste if you mapped it on to reality if you just
(4:09:16) mapped it onto reality then what would you talking about some other thing yeah what would you say then if you mapped it onto reality what do you mean are all
(4:09:23) women's T if you mapped it on to reality rather than how you kind of subjectively feel like they should feel about
(4:09:29) themselves if you were to map it on to reality outside of that subjective analysis would very depending on where
(4:09:34) I'm at you're in Kazakhstan I don't know what the women are like so so what would
(4:09:39) you say for example what would you say what would you say Scarlett Johansson would be aesthetically cross-culturally
(4:09:46) to most men do you think most men find attract Russian milk depends on I'm I'm only talking from someone who you guys
(4:09:52) all would not find to be attractive like I'm not someone you're into but I know there's men who think that I'm the
(4:09:57) and different countries I go like like we were talking about it last time like I might be like and someone was clowning
(4:10:02) they're like she's not a Seattle 10 but like I think it really depends on where you're at what country could scar let Johansson be considered not pretty in I
(4:10:10) don't know I haven't been to all the countries could you even Envision that there is one I could you could what would you speculate um I would speculate
(4:10:17) the the the area where it would be attractive would be in a culture where the people look like
(4:10:24) that Sweden so you don't Scandinavian countries so what you saying Europe just
(4:10:29) Europe and I mean sure it depends on I mean I just think you don't think Africa either it depends I'm probably South
(4:10:35) Africa I don't know I don't know I I mean it just depends like I'm going to go different places and people are going to receive me different I was considered
(4:10:42) to be beautiful in China but not necessarily someone they would be attracted to if that makes sense and when I went to Trinidad I was the
(4:10:49) in California people don't really care that much because I'm not necessarily their societal standards of beauty so I
(4:10:54) really think it depends on where I'm at or where the person's at I'm not going to I'm not trying to be mean here but no
(4:11:00) one's a I I don't think you're a 10 I know you said that what did she say I'm seven see
(4:11:09) look Catholic that's why it's Catholic I was raised Catholic what does that have to do with anything here we have we have
(4:11:15) another conversational thread here that we can get into uh Misty last time we
(4:11:20) were on we got into a big fun debate we were talking about the patriarchy and
(4:11:25) systems and oppressor oppressed we talked about white men you remember you
() 
(4:11:31) remember can't can't remember now I have the ultimate representative here of the
(4:11:36) patriarch and I was hoping that you guys could
(4:11:42) have a calm and collected conversation about I don't know patriarchy and
(4:11:50) systems of the oppressors and the oppressed white men you want a white
(4:11:57) male to have a conversation about who's oppressed with a black female yes that sounds dope not going to lie the white
(4:12:03) half of you I don't know that I need to have thank you I don't I don't know that I know I just don't know that I've got
(4:12:09) that all in my in my I came here to talk about dating I don't want to talk about that with my
(4:12:15) grandfather wait who's your grandfather sorry my grandfather's also a white male so I'm just like I want to have that did
(4:12:21) you just say something rather agist no I'm talking about I'm deeply offended that you
(4:12:27) talking I just I was raised by a white male and a white female and so yeah the
(4:12:34) the the experiences we have are so vastly different that I'm just not even interested in going down that road it's
(4:12:39) like standpoint the I'm just it's a lot it for me it's just it's it's a lot
(4:12:44) emotionally to have to like um pack that I know you may guys not understand but it's it's no I understand it's called
(4:12:51) standpoint Theory oh okay so Fe feminist standpoint Theory they went back through and rewrote all of American literally
(4:12:59) I'm not kidding they rewrote all of American history from the perspective of women because they felt like just giving
(4:13:04) a detailed actual historic analysis wasn't Fair because had to come from the
(4:13:09) perspective of women so that's that's what you're talking about is called standpoint Theory it's I don't know that
(4:13:15) I was talking about that well it's the same same that exact thing you're saying because my experience is so vastly
(4:13:20) different our perspectives are going to be vastly different right but then the question comes down to well which
(4:13:26) perspective should we list no it's not that it's just that I don't want to no okay that's fine well maybe we can maybe
(4:13:32) we can get back there a littleit l oh talk about that's definitely related to D
(4:13:37) well feminism you know I think that's very much related to dating because feminism you know feminism um okay so
(4:13:46) here you want you want to talk about dating let's talk about dating let's talk about dating let's talk about body count let's talk about body count should
() 
(4:13:54) do you object because a lot of times men men care a lot about about this do you
(4:13:59) object to men caring about a woman's body count starting with you I just
(4:14:05) think body counts arbitrary arbitrary okay all right far what about
(4:14:11) you um I think I've said before if the man is also highly selective and disciplined I think it's totally his
(4:14:16) prerogative to prefer a woman with a low body count okay what about you yeah I don't have a issue with it do is it
(4:14:24) immature I'm sorry is it immature for a guy to care about body count the past is the past I just I really believe
(4:14:31) that you should get what you want and if that's something that you want go for it now what would it make me feel sad if I
(4:14:38) decided if I wasn't part of your your crew and I I liked you and I because of my body count you were not interested
(4:14:43) for sure but will I live yeah okay I mean you know you're about to be
(4:14:50) asked a question you could have started this not room here yeah there's no room okay um I feel like room for you just
(4:14:57) come this way a little bit no if he takes his leg out then yes but other I feel like it's up to the person to be
(4:15:05) honest like the the girl I mean if she she doesn't
(4:15:11) mind wait it's a the guy right if the how do you feel about men who care about body do you object to men having a
(4:15:18) preference in body count like if no because it's their choice Catholic all
(4:15:24) right I do not object okay you said it was you said it was arbitrary yeah so to
(4:15:29) go back on whether I or not I just think that at the end of the day yeah um it's
(4:15:36) their individ idual right to choose if they care about that aspect or not cuz
(4:15:41) for both sides that's like aspect I don't care about from my perspective so if someone has that then that it's not a
(4:15:48) compatibility factor for us and that's fine with me well arbitrary means without system so it's not arbitrary we
(4:15:56) have a system in place to know what this is which is how many men a woman's been with that's the system so it's not
(4:16:02) really arbitrary you make a distinction that um it doesn't mean anything or it's
(4:16:08) not important to you but it's definitely not arbitrary so I just like backing up I'm just curious why do you do you think
(4:16:16) from the man's perspective if the preference is to hold the double standard which is that we find it to be
(4:16:23) very important you don't find it to be important do you think we're holding a double standard I I think this double
(4:16:29) standard exists if a man has a high body count and refuses to be with women with a low body or high body it doesn't make
(4:16:35) it wrong it's it is a double it's a double standard but it's by definition it's what it's it's what they
(4:16:42) choose to do and I just I'm just not really in the business of telling men
(4:16:47) what I think they should or shouldn't do if I'm not interested in having them as friends or Partners so it's just like I
(4:16:53) well going around the table once more so uh some of you said body count doesn't
(4:16:58) really matter uh don't OB to or you do object perhaps to men caring about body
() 
(4:17:05) count you think it shouldn't matter so much you think shouldn't be such a big deal uh what's your body count I don't
(4:17:12) have an exact number I have an idea range is fine um probably somewhere between 50 to 60 50 to 60 okay um far
(4:17:21) zero into the mic zero okay now just real quick because after the last panel
(4:17:29) when you said that a ton of people went nutso in my Discord and said that they had video of you saying the opposite of
(4:17:35) that and that you basically are just LARPing and just pretending that that's true and I just I'm not saying that
(4:17:42) they're right because I don't know I'm just saying that that's what if I had to guess what they're responding to is I make skits on Tik Tok kind of like
(4:17:48) satirical skits about discussions of gender so I have like an offscreen male voice so he'll ask me a question or I'll
(4:17:53) read a question being like what's your body count and it's all scripted and I'll say something like um eight and then he'll say like that's disgusting
(4:17:59) and I'll ask him like a question response so they're responding to like yes SKS okay cuz every time I've talked
(4:18:04) with you uh it's always been this same so I have no reason to doubt it but I had seen that so I thought I'd ask oh I
(4:18:11) don't share R range you want to do a range range I don't share
(4:18:20) okay probably like eight probably like eight or nine or 10 eight or nine or 10
(4:18:30) no not 10 eight or nine okay all right
(4:18:35) want I will not be sharing Maddie what okay well you've shared before yeah she
(4:18:43) has a boyfriend do multiply by three and that's the real
(4:18:50) [Laughter] number so
(4:18:57) waitan that doesn't let me be clear I wouldn't I
(4:19:02) mean if I'm saying that high have a number if it was higher I would say it was higher say to be clear I don't think that R this situation next time you have
(4:19:09) to say 20 cuz you know they're already going to multiply so actually it's 20
(4:19:15) okay uh so okay got it cool cool uh good
(4:19:22) talk wait Brian how many are you at we just skipped you and we skipped all the men at oh yeah okay fine we'll do the
(4:19:28) men we'll do the guys yeah what do you mean why would we not do the men I don't know I lost count I've been around a
(4:19:34) Block H have you said it before on the show I have said it what what is it I
(4:19:39) said it was probably between 50 and 60 wow multiply by that three have the
(4:19:45) number you guys got something in common I I think the quote in the movie is like divided by three for men oh really yeah
(4:19:51) cuz men men will lie you should have said 150 bro uh Mason uh
(4:20:00) zero oh I'm married I can't disclose that kind of information if you're not willing to I'll tell you what I'll go a
(4:20:06) you no won't be doing that I'm not married I'm not doing that when I lo something down then we can
(4:20:12) come back here I got you f wait what I don't know what that has to do with anything I'll definitely go if you go
(4:20:17) I'll tell I don't really care that much share with youself mared huh did you
(4:20:24) save yourself for Mar if I show you yours you show me mine H okay all right
(4:20:30) it's good times I'm curious going around the table uh that wasn't even like a thing when I was younger
(4:20:37) who here considers themselves did you say your number I missed it I'd rather not speak about
() 
(4:20:43) that um all right going around the table who here considers themselves a
(4:20:49) feminist can we have the definition before you ask that question somebody who hates
(4:20:54) men not me I'm straight huh I said not me I suppose you
(4:20:59) could still be stra hate there's a lot of men they are difficult I'm not going to lie but no I don't hate men okay
(4:21:07) all right I'm being a little fous well we went by your definition uh a
(4:21:13) feminist somebody who believes things that aren't
(4:21:19) true I'm sorry I'm not being I definitely am I'm not being very generous here in my all things true only
(4:21:27) all right here the most the most generous definition uh somebody who advocates for women and the rights of
(4:21:33) women that's the most generous definition I can give feminism by that definition for
(4:21:40) sure yeah so far it's been no yes no yes so it depends on what your definition I
(4:21:45) suppose that's the most generous definition I can give it though well by going by that definition do you have a maybe a counter defin for feminism no I
(4:21:52) don't that's the thing is like when he says that I want to be specific what it is because um because of the debate that
(4:21:59) he's trying to get into so I just want to be okay so my view of feminism is and
(4:22:05) I don't object to women's advocacy or women's rights but cuz by definition but what I they're
(4:22:13) trying to paint it as this again there's nothing wrong to fight for women's advocacy or women's rights but they
(4:22:19) claim to be fighting for equality and that's very different than women's rights or women's advocacy so my view is
(4:22:26) for example if there is some form of equality that does not stand to benefit
(4:22:31) women said feminists will not fight in order to secure said equality where
(4:22:37) feminists or women do not stand to benefit from some form of equality they will not fight for it I guess by that
(4:22:44) definition I'm not then because so it's not clear so I guess when it comes to feminist feminist saying they're for
(4:22:49) equality it's not clear to me if they're for equality we have different strengths so I wouldn't believe that we could be equal like we do have different
(4:22:54) strengths and I think we should should be celebrated for those different strength instead of trying to become each other ex wouldn't it be in the in
(4:23:00) the way that we've equalized a lot of things in so Society given women equal rights wouldn't it be equal to make
(4:23:08) women subject to military conscription that would that would be equality but I'm I heard a feminist object to that
(4:23:16) yeah no feminist would feminists would say we want to do away with military conscription which is just not
(4:23:21) politically tenable for any it's never going to happen you can't do away with military conscription I'm pretty sure
(4:23:28) feminists will say that they want to be drafted you're thinking of maybe like Trad wives but feminists do
(4:23:34) notv I most Fe with very traditional feminis what about this in Florida in
(4:23:39) Florida there was a bill toiz feminists would say that no oh don't you think
(4:23:45) feminists have like fought to want to enter male dominated spaces even if they don't benefit them maybe not like
(4:23:51) only they don't like for instance feminists don't fight to go and have teams against professional male NFL
(4:23:58) players do they but they no that's a men Space do
(4:24:04) feminists try to and Advocate that they can have teams of women go play football
(4:24:10) against male NFL players they literally do and then people laugh at them which is somewhat justified in my opinion and
(4:24:16) people say like they literally don't they literally are not out there advocating for that they're out there
(4:24:22) advocating for their own teams against women but not really teams against men in contact Brian have you never heard a
(4:24:28) feminist say that there should be desegregation of gender and sports yeah but they're talking to the tea issue not
(4:24:34) talking to that I no no no I don't I mean in terms of Tia isue have you have you you heard feminist say that like oh
(4:24:40) we as female athletes want to compete with male athletes cuz I feel like that is something that they say and I think that's a more laughable point of
(4:24:45) feminism it's possible they've said it but I've never heard that that's really I've never even seen what what I've seen
(4:24:51) feminist do is move legislation towards having their own teams having their own leagues having the female version of the
(4:24:59) you know the WNBA having all of that I've never seen them Advocate to have
(4:25:05) teams actually go up against the male I've never seen that with the te issue
(4:25:10) just questioning as that progresses and I don't know how we're going to end up but I mean that's going to end up being
(4:25:15) in question yeah but the feminists are against the te's some of them but some
(4:25:21) of them are not most of them are most of the feminists are against the teas because of this because they say we
(4:25:26) fought all this time to get our own leagues and now you're going to let men in them that's why they're so mad right
(4:25:32) so yeah I think I think that this is an incorrect analysis honestly I think I'm just too deep in
(4:25:38) the feminist discourse so like feminists go after turfs and turfs go after people who say that so I think like I see it
(4:25:43) well turfs are the feminists the other ones aren't feminists the other ones are postmodernists and they just kind of call themselves feminists but turfs are
(4:25:50) actual feminists those were the ones who were in the 60s who were burning their bras and doing all that that's
(4:25:55) that's that's why I think it's kind of like counterproductive to even say like oh do feminists do this or this because even within feminist discourse like they all hate each other each other's
(4:26:02) principles but that doesn't mean that there's not certain principles they both go towards so well in this case
(4:26:08) egalitarianism that would be one of the major ones and the assumption that men and women can be interchangeable widgets
(4:26:14) whether or not they Advocate and move legislation towards something that makes sense like if we actually were
(4:26:21) interchangeable widgets should women's team uh you know go up against men's NFL
(4:26:26) teams they may not push that way right instead they push towards having their own teams this and that but definitely
(4:26:33) there's core underlying principles that they're after complely disagree I feel like I'm just way too deep in it like I just always hear them butt heads it's
(4:26:39) like whether we should have a category for like female Jeopardy winners or some feminists think that that's super degrading to women I just I see all the
(4:26:45) conflict okay so when I'm talking about principles let's make sure we clarify this you and I would agree on what egalitarianism is do you think or do
(4:26:53) would we need to Define it yeah could you what's that yeah could you give your definition of egalitarianism it would be
(4:26:59) like a form of movement towards equality right but even that's kind of vague right cuz there's so many
(4:27:04) different ways people can interpret it yeah but I mean at some point we we're going to have to reduce it to something
(4:27:09) we can agree on so what what do you think egalitarianism is would that work for this or no no it would but like I'm
(4:27:16) saying like feminism again is also a definition of pushing towards women's rights and equality but then there's so
(4:27:21) much conflict about how you actually achieve that and what it means get more specific what I'm saying with the
(4:27:26) principle though like the principle of egalitarianism you're not going to say that modern feminists and turfs and all
(4:27:32) of them don't believe in the principle of egalitarianism you're not going to say say any of them do like that's one
(4:27:37) core for the analysis of the whole that you would say is a principle they have in common I'm not even trying to be
(4:27:44) Devil's Advocate I'm genuinely disagreeing because I think a lot of turfs will say like we need our own spaces because we're physically weaker
(4:27:50) like we need to be a protected class galarian ISM okay so then equalitarianism just feels really broad
(4:27:56) right now in discuss there could be an analysis of which way you move for what is equal but they still believe in the
(4:28:01) principle of the thing okay I just disagree like I said I think a lot of turfs will say that like we are a weaker
(4:28:07) gender we need to be protective think tur will say I don't believe in egalitarianism honestly I would yeah really yeah which
(4:28:16) ones like I just said the on the whole thing that makes tur is they're like we fought for women's rights and equality
(4:28:23) and egalitarianism and now the te's are coming in and Wrecking all that by allowing men into women's SP that's
(4:28:29) their whole thing right and typically they're saying it on the premise that women are the weaker physically gender
(4:28:35) and so they want to be a protected class they want to have locker rooms to themselves in which you get what I'm saying yeah but they're saying if men
(4:28:42) can have their own teams we can have our own teams that's egalitarianism right
(4:28:48) I'm just saying I've seen so many feminists say that they want to compete with men in sports I've seen so many feminists say we want to be a protected class I've seen some say we don't want a
(4:28:55) separate category for like female Awards and intellectualism and the principle would still be overlapping all of those
(4:29:00) I guess but then the principle seems kind of irrelevant to the conversation because it doesn't actually get at any of the issues that are being discussed then one of the fa my favorite things
(4:29:07) that you've said all night then is that egalitarianism is so broad we don't even know what the it means okay so all
() 
(4:29:13) right I'm fine with that we have a chat here uh I pulled this up earlier but it was uh directed at you Andrew Andrew I
(4:29:19) respect your conviction but you can be nicer that's from Lum dis sky from
(4:29:26) Canada I I feel like um feel like people often conflate when you're having a
(4:29:32) heated argument or discussion or you say say things which are uncomfort that that's meanness do one like this I
(4:29:39) associate I associate yeah I associate I don't care what a woman's analysis on what kindness
(4:29:45) is or meanness I have a different standard clearly on what those things are I don't think that it's cruelty or
(4:29:52) uh being unkind or being mean to say things which are obviously objectively
(4:29:57) true that people just don't want to hear because it makes it's not objectively true that I shouldn't have children that
(4:30:03) is not objectively true I didn't say you shouldn't have children
(4:30:08) you did you were like you have yes your movement she what happened was she said
(4:30:15) I don't want to have children and I went yes your movement was an indication of your op her but that action alone is
(4:30:22) what what we're talking about and what's wrong with that action it's not kind why is it unkind that's what she said
(4:30:29) because you did it with malice thank you oh see so it's in the tone not what is said that's my point oh oh come on you
(4:30:36) could at least concede that you did that to be AIT nothing I me he literally said it was an move so concession can
(4:30:43) we rewind literally roll the tape I'm not saying you shouldn't do it I'm just saying but you did it to be like and a
(4:30:48) little bit Yeah so the thing is is like was it hilarious yes but was it mean no
(4:30:54) it wasn't mean was it hilarious mediocre at best OB then why were you laughing I
(4:31:00) wasn't laughing well you should have been I didn't I know but she was okay well there you got one one okay I'm not
(4:31:07) going to do that so uh any anyone have anything dating related they'd like to get off
(4:31:13) their chest here I'd like to talk about dating for a little portion of the show if you guys don't don't mind oh you're
(4:31:20) mediating now I love that I'm trying a little bit I'm trying to best you were clicking a lot are you playing soli are
(4:31:26) you playing soli no I've four and a half hours I literally hear
(4:31:32) yous show don't worry about it don't worry about it uh all right so uh and
(4:31:37) does anybody have anything dating related that they would like to get off their chest maybe for the ladies men are
(4:31:44) pissing you off in some way you know they're not buying you your dinner uh you know whatever it may be is there
(4:31:50) anything anything you guys want to talk about dating related maybe what about the
(4:31:55) orgasm Gap we can talk about orgasm gaps what is that apparently women are not
(4:32:02) coming as much as men are that's in sexual I have a good dating topic you mean per
(4:32:08) sex per person or the group what are you talking about I was I've been wondering about this bringing this topic up if if
(4:32:15) women think that The Sisterhood is stronger than the Brotherhood when it comes to dating so meaning you think
(4:32:22) women are more unified around um like uh keeping secrets and supporting each
(4:32:28) other and things like this when it comes to the dating Market than men are abut not well men talk a lot though they talk
(4:32:34) way more than we think no no not really they create podcasts where they
(4:32:41) talk I feel like woman will ensure each other that everything is okay no matter if it's right or
(4:32:47) wrong you mean that toxic best friend stuff yeah exactly I would argue that women talk know a joke though when we do
(4:32:54) that to each other I would argue that for example oh well we got the chat Bender
(4:32:59) the offender donated $200 you could talk about how more women are cheating than men and
(4:33:06) now is that true is that statistic is it true is that num don't know I've heard
(4:33:11) some studies cheat perhaps it's the case I what why don't we go around the table
(4:33:17) and see who cheats cheating more than men though yeah that's kind of I mean I I would say though when it comes to who
() 
(4:33:23) talks more for example after an a an encounter the first time having sex with
(4:33:29) somebody hold on hold on guys any stud you look up and show down look you know you lying no they can you stop
(4:33:36) interrupting please okay first time encounter a woman is
(4:33:42) going to tell her best friend all the details about the encounter they're going to tell them the penis size
(4:33:48) they're going to share intimate details whereas men most men I would say aren't sharing those details with their friends
(4:33:55) like for example I would have to be dating a girl for like 3 to 6 months
(4:34:00) before I even before any of my friends even know who she is really yeah that's
(4:34:06) valid for mature adult men though girls girls will be like after
(4:34:11) having their first uh sexual experience with a new guy will tell their girlfriend or girlfriends everything how
(4:34:18) big was his dick how long did he last D D D D D all these details I refuse to share with my male friends any
(4:34:25) sexual details they won't even know if I've slept with a girl I will not disclose because I'm I I don't want to
(4:34:32) I'm very discreet I would not disclose any detail any intimate details to even
(4:34:38) my closest male friend oh you hung out with Becky yesterday how was it Brian it
(4:34:43) was good that's it that's all my male friend is getting all you guys agree with that what if it was like a famous
(4:34:48) Instagram model talked about as if it was like a famous IG model who you and your friend
(4:34:53) have like talked about damn it I don't date famous IG models but if they were I
(4:34:59) mean like if some guy who like or some girl since you're famous if like some girl who you am I famous I don't think so I'm hyping you up if some who like
(4:35:05) you and your boys have like talked about like this girl is so hot like I don't talk to my I don't talk to my male
(4:35:11) friends about oh my God but don't you think a lot of guys would is I was just I was just racking my brain
(4:35:18) thinking about it as he was saying it and even when years and years ago if I had you
(4:35:26) know engaged with a woman and I I was talking to my friend it would just be something as simple as like yeah yeah I
(4:35:31) plower that was about it it wasn't really detailed that there wasn't any of that just like what ear was this that
(4:35:37) you were plowing long time ago long time
(4:35:43) ago in my experience if I even Dam a guy innocuously like I will hear about it through the great
(4:35:50) [Laughter]
(4:35:58) B see how you laughed at my joke I was laughing at your joke all
(4:36:03) right good answer wait what oh you guys what about you guys same you guys don't talk about
(4:36:11) it no my friends just assume I smash every girl they see me with like they don't get into detail you guys don't
(4:36:17) need to talk about it yeah I don't need to say they just know it's just assumed yeah he definitely hit that it's assumed
(4:36:25) well generally speaking I'm probably not going to be discussing those things didn't hit that what about when if you
(4:36:31) if you touch a Boop do you tell your friends if you touch a Boop have you touched a Bo you're a kid I don't uh
(4:36:37) kiss and tell no wait Mason Mason no
(4:36:42) okay they feel like sandbags Mason oh my goodness yeah well so no I don't I don't
(4:36:50) usually I'm not going to give dish out details like I might tell a guy like the vague
(4:36:56) generalities but uh no it's not going to be like specific huh we're more specific
(4:37:01) yeah yeah well I might hit on key notes like what's a keynote I don't know she's
(4:37:07) Pleasant to be around I'm not going to be very descriptive it's gonna be like okay this is generally how her demeanor
(4:37:13) is I really like her yeah I like her yeah yeah that's cute I would almost go to the point of if I was with a girl and
(4:37:21) I found out that she had told her uh female friend group intimate details
(4:37:28) about our first encounter that actually might be grounds for me dumping her even if she's
(4:37:33) praising it yeah yes and she was like this was the best sex I've ever had yeah I mean I suppose
(4:37:39) that's I suppose that's now now that I think of it if you were to have a f like
(4:37:45) talking to your friend about that would kind of be gay right because you're you're basically then you have to
(4:37:51) picture your friend having that's what we do that's not what we do that's how I think that's what talk yeah that's what
(4:37:57) think I don't want to know I don't no a great you just you're just excited for
(4:38:02) your friend like okay I feel like it's just it's it's disrespectful it's disrespectful to share private intimate
(4:38:09) details with with your friend group why it's been but but I think it's something
(4:38:15) that's super common among women like I would say majority of women this is like the most intimate act you can have with
(4:38:21) a human being and you're just like airing that out to anybody in like almost indiscreetly the way or
(4:38:27) indiscriminately that's what I'm trying the way that it biologically works we work out is different though women get
(4:38:33) um we get a brain like um energy surge from doing things like you like you'll
(4:38:39) see monkeys will pick at each other so we get a brain energy surge from having these conversations about those types of
(4:38:45) things by betraying your partner you call it portraying but we call it it's like a sense of community it's it's biological Yeah by betraying your
(4:38:52) partners yes because we don't care about you guys that's what it is I mean that is practically what's happening we just
(4:38:58) see it differently we're not trying to it doesn't matter how you see it but it's so common that women don't even
(4:39:04) realize how kind of problematic it is to be sharing these intimate details about their Partners I I like that's just it's
(4:39:12) the status quo like I recognize that it's just it's just viewed as the normal
(4:39:18) social behavior to be sharing this thing are we talking about Partners or just people that we've like either I would I
(4:39:24) would I feel like you're partner I the rules are slightly different yeah but if if you're a woman who doesn't wait long
(4:39:30) periods of time before having sex with a guy who he might end up become I would argue most adult relationships in
(4:39:36) today's day and age it's not let's wait 10 dates and then have sex it's have sex
(4:39:42) fairly early on continue seeing each other continue hooking up and then we find we like we both like each other we
(4:39:49) find ourselves now in a relationship so of course I mean if even if that's the case where it's like well what if it's
(4:39:55) just a casual hookup that casual hookup could end up becoming your boyfriend then you've already disclosed to your
(4:40:00) close female friends his penis size all wide variety of various intimate details
(4:40:06) but you guys also don't even have names at that point like you're elevator guy so like by the time you're my boyfriend
(4:40:11) what that's even worse I mean not not I'm not talking about hooking up I'm just saying like for instance like I used to have a guy that I crushed at the
(4:40:17) gym so he was like Jim Bay and then there was like a really cute guy at the grocery so he was like grocery Grocery Store Bay and it wasn't someone I was
(4:40:23) like interested in but that being said I could be like yeah he was wearing the shirt of like whatever they don't even
(4:40:28) they don't have like a place yet until they do and then I feel like a relationship's different yeah I mean
(4:40:34) look I get it I get that it's just something that women do but um you guys feel betrayed by it I do think it's a
(4:40:41) betrayal of trust I mean it's uh it's interesting like like if I'm meeting if I'm meeting imagine if I disclose to my
(4:40:49) male friends like I told them something about your or something like
(4:40:54) wouldn't you feel a little uncomfortable meeting my friends like if you knew that I told my male friend oh her was
(4:41:01) like this and the lips were like this I mean there's a bit of a stench and like
(4:41:07) you know like you feel like betrayed to some degree how would I know that you told them I mean what if you found out
(4:41:13) though that's the point here's the thing if he said something bad then we probably shouldn't be together and if he said something good I will feel
(4:41:20) flattered oh okay I mean I guess I don't know what if he what if he showed the nudes what if he no absolutely
(4:41:27) notal but if he's describing he's describing it and giving them the visual okay so actually so this is interesting
(4:41:34) so men are extremely visual creatures so but women are extremely like emotionally
(4:41:41) descriptive creatures so like male pornography is very visual female
(4:41:46) pornography is descriptive so it's like if you read pornographic novels that's like the equivalent so you're the
(4:41:54) equivalent Indulgence in what you're saying as you're describing these things that is the equivalent to sharing a nude
(4:42:01) for men what you're saying I what you're saying I think that good point in my relationship I would just respect
(4:42:07) my boyfriend like whatever relationship I would respect so if he felt like that for sure maybe I screwed up and he was
(4:42:12) elevator guy at first and like he might have got a descript before then but once he becomes my man I'm I'm hoping that
(4:42:18) I'm going to respect what he wants and we' had that conversation and and hearing this all from you guys is actually the first time I've ever
(4:42:24) thought about it because we do use that as bonding and we don't necessarily I know when I'm hearing or talking about
(4:42:29) it I don't it's not really even about that person it's about my experience with it how did you feel with it how did it make you feel what was was your
(4:42:34) situation with this and that's kind of what we kind of bond over I guess yeah yeah I mean it's it's nice to hear like
(4:42:41) where like your thought process as you're having those discussions but kind of going back to the point of I want to
(4:42:48) find a woman uh so as Andrew was talking about I want to find a woman who's going to put my needs above her own I want her
(4:42:55) to think about how is this going to make me look in front of her friends so yeah and I I really appreciate that you're
(4:43:01) acknowledging like this is not something I thought about yeah maybe it's going to be something that you'll consider down the road yeah absolutely I also don't
(4:43:08) like talking about my my relationship with going to change is anything going to change I mean I think that people
(4:43:14) change people I grow I grow and change maybe it's something that you regret you've done in the past I I don't I
(4:43:20) don't think that I've done that us men can say we don't like it when the the women that we've hooked up with or even
(4:43:26) our potential future girlfriends disclose to their female friend group various intimate details that in our in
(4:43:32) our view or in my view ought to remain private between us because they are just that intimate details uh I think it's
(4:43:39) probably the case that even if we were to articulate this that women are still going they you guys enjoy this kind of
(4:43:46) you guys enjoy sharing these details it's the tea it's the gossip you guys like talking about really yeah like
(4:43:54) that's a little bit I mean so what he's saying yes like maybe if it's my boyfriend I will do it out of respect
(4:44:00) but like for instance I recently had like an rendevu with someone who I think
(4:44:05) is interested in me and the place that we Rond vued was a very unique place and
(4:44:11) so like I did I told my roommate like and I told him that I told my roommate
(4:44:16) and he was like oh you're telling the girls and it wasn't girls it was just my roommate cuz like we're both single and sometimes we like we'll talk about our
(4:44:22) dates and so yeah I mean I did but I told him as well and and now that I'm thinking about it he's might have had
(4:44:28) like he might be having a thought like well if you do something I don't know if he's even thinking that far ahead cuz we're not like that yet but but it's
(4:44:34) just interesting cuz I'm like I'm now I'm thinking like he's right and and to just to add sort of to Mason's Point
(4:44:40) here um if a girl sent me like a sexy photo or nude photo I would never share
(4:44:47) that with anybody my eyes only my eyes only so unsolicited get shared with
(4:44:53) everybody just that's well okay I get I get if there's like a get shared with every I think that's a bit different
(4:44:58) though are you talking like a guy who you like who's sending a dick Pi I don't believe I don't think men should do that
(4:45:03) by the way I don't do that I've never sent a nude photo or a dickpick or anything I I
(4:45:10) granted I would not object to receiving to receiving picks I'm just saying
(4:45:17) ladies if you want to send me a this the last episode too I'm for it requesting I'm for it BLM big laia
(4:45:25) matter would you like to join my organization I I wouldn't actually fit into your um oh crew because I don't
(4:45:35) solidarity hello yeah I just I wouldn't I yep is it because you don't yes I see
(4:45:41) yes sorry I didn't I don't want that was too I want to take it away no but you can still be uh like solidarity I want
(4:45:48) you to be happy so whatever that means I'm down for that you know any but no I'm kidding um okay good talk I don't
(4:45:53) rip do you guys talk about that do do girls like share like we don't really
(4:45:59) talk about that but I can tell you the first time I saw one I was like what the  the and then she was like yeah and I was like wow I didn't know they
(4:46:05) came in different shapes and sizes like that word you guys is this something you talk about Maddie like with your girlfriend
(4:46:12) ever you guys just go into the is that what you guys do when you go into the bathroom together no yeah about it good
(4:46:20) talk any you guys talk about penises no no not really that's what I'm
(4:46:25) saying like dude mine's like an immature thing like only teenagers do this
(4:46:31) stuff yeah I was a teenager when into this you brought it up youit brought it
(4:46:39) up he just looks at you did were were we going around the table on are you a
(4:46:44) feminist and then you asked me for a def somebody asked me for a definition or something no and then we were talking about oh did did we get everybody said
(4:46:52) oh jeez I'm we were talking about you now had brought up if we talk about interactions with our men's with our
(4:46:58) women word that's what you had moved to word anybody anything dating related
(4:47:04) they like to get off their their chest anything I just think I was initially going to say earlier when you asked a
(4:47:10) similar question is I I feel my biggest um issue when it comes to dating is uh
(4:47:17) just emotionally immature people in general like that being a running theme of lacking communication lacking um the
(4:47:25) desire to process emotions outside of either unhealthy coping skills or um in
(4:47:34) in ways that are just not conducive to healthy relationships and I I find that
(4:47:39) to be like my biggest barrier and even being interested in someone I see oh we
(4:47:45) have we have a Reddit post we need to react to Nick if you can uh pull up the Reddit post this kind of went got I
(4:47:53) think it was on the New York the New York Post uh reacted to
(4:48:03) it yep can you scroll up so it's
(4:48:08) readable are my dating deal breakers too strict can you put us on the other side
() 
(4:48:15) uh I'm a 29-year-old can you make it a little bigger y all right I'm a 29-year-old straight
(4:48:21) man who has been actively dating since I turned 18 in that time I've met a wide array of women and I've constructed a
(4:48:27) short deal breaker list to help me determine suitability early in the dating stage I showed this to a friend
(4:48:33) who said it was too straight and quite discriminatory here it is has cheated in a past relationship takes
(4:48:39) recreational drugs on a regular basis has an incurable STD is currently in a situationship or
(4:48:46) has a friend with benefits has low standards of hygiene is a sex worker whether online or in person has extreme
(4:48:53) political views is a single mother to one or more children that's a good list
(4:48:58) they said it was too strict do you guys think that's too strict of a list
(4:49:04) great list I great list I agree it's a great list great list solid list I don't
(4:49:09) have an opinion about the list but I don't think it's too strict that's honestly what I feel too I just think
(4:49:15) like it's like you know at the end of the day that's his prerogative if those things were to cause contention um or
(4:49:22) negative aspects within the relationship from the foundation of it then those are
(4:49:27) his deal breakers and that's his right would you would you guys recommend him though I'm sorry recommend what like
(4:49:34) let's say I I'm sure you said great list right and you do relationship coaching
(4:49:41) so you would recommend that list to other people right like you should adopt this yeah you should would you guys do
(4:49:47) that would you tell people they should adopt that list absolutely there are things on that list that I would
(4:49:53) recommend but as a whole I mean there are things that I don't think are deal breakers so I wouldn't necessarily
(4:49:58) recommend it because I would only recommend something that was something I would coign and I personally don't
(4:50:05) coincide like like I said some of those things I would some of them are not deal breakers for me um so like for example a
(4:50:12) single parent my my ex is a single parent so like that's not a deal breaker to me yeah that's so kind of the point
(4:50:18) of this is to say the reason let's say he was guilty of everything on the list
(4:50:24) everything M but in his capacity uh as a coach recommended to
(4:50:30) other men to follow that list because that would be in in their best interest most of the time that's the kind of the
(4:50:37) spirit yeah that's the spirit of what we're talking about so pretend for a second if you were a relationship coach for men would you recommend this same
(4:50:45) type of list that he would recommends the question my biggest thing is I don't think single mothers as as a whole
(4:50:52) should be a deal breaker as a generality or someone who's cheated in the past because sometimes people like
(4:50:59) you know they've made a m they like and that's a case by case and probably the majority of experience but it is enough
(4:51:06) of an aspect to take into account that's actually one of the predominant factors that predicts if someone will cheat
(4:51:13) though if they've cheated in the past so that's just something to be mind I'm not saying that's not objectively true or
(4:51:20) not but I'm just saying that there are I there are cases where that's not true and I'm willing to give someone the
(4:51:26) benefit of doubt if I like them enough and trust them enough and their current version of self and I feel that people
(4:51:31) can prove like actionable change within themselves not necessarily just physically but mentally emotionally
(4:51:39) through therapy work other aspects as well um career change several factors
(4:51:44) that can embolden them to stop toxic cycles and it's unfortunately a rare
(4:51:51) thing that occurs in current Society but it does happen and I want to give someone on an individual basis
(4:51:59) that that chance so a deal breaker for me is an absolute and meaning that if
(4:52:07) there's the possibility that that could be a situation that I could work with then I wouldn't consider that a deal
(4:52:14) breaker I would consider that like a pink VAP flag versus a red flag you see what I'm saying yeah I get what you
(4:52:19) saying I don't disagree I think I might be able to ad I I could adopt that that position but I don't think I'll be able
(4:52:26) to to adopt that position if it were someone that holds your point of view on
(4:52:32) your idea of regret so elaborate okay so if someone is so if
(4:52:38) someone has engaged in the activity of cheating I want them to be able to have
(4:52:45) regret for what they've done recognize that that was wrong it was evil and it was destructive to that relationship or
(4:52:52) to Future relationships I want them to be have done the emotional groundwork to work through that understand sus out
(4:53:00) what was wrong with that be able to come to me and show me like I I toiled over this I see what where I
(4:53:08) messed up it was wrong I regret that decision I wish I did not do it and like
(4:53:13) there is tangible evidence to that effect then I could get on board yeah and you know I'll be honest when it
(4:53:19) comes to regret that is a topic in my life I think I have flip-flopped on and I have struggled
(4:53:25) to understand my relationship with because I've had like you know from being born to 18 I was a Mormon and then
(4:53:32) I had a few years in my early 20s where I was just angry at the world and then I
(4:53:37) had like a very committed monogamous lifestyle relationship and then I threw myself into another extreme so I've had
(4:53:43) these like sections in life from like very from like operating from very different perspectives and very
(4:53:51) different um like modalities places within myself and so um I just feel that
(4:54:00) essentially based on what you just said it really does make me want to reflect my perception of regret okay so yeah
(4:54:08) think that that's and that I am the kind of person where like I really do continually like um self-actualize
(4:54:15) myself I'm very self-aware wait can you just speak sorry yeah I'm very self-aware and so like I'm willing to
(4:54:21) admit when I'm wrong or when I think I can improve upon something and I am the kind of person that wants to strive to
(4:54:27) better myself even if I don't necessarily know how or how to overcome certain disconnects I have because of
(4:54:34) like aspects of myself my identity my my you know
(4:54:41) moving so guys uh we're going to do about 30 more minutes so I I lowered the
(4:54:47) uh TTS and the read threshold it's 50 and 100 50 to uh or sorry excuse wait
() 
(4:54:52) hold on 50 and up to read answer 100 and up now triggers TTS uh Nick I think we
(4:54:58) just keep the lights on to be honest uh we don't I guess it's the after show but we'll keep the lights on as is um
(4:55:07) so I don't know if we get back into this uh I we need something juicy here at the
(4:55:13) end we need to get into some juicy topics here juicy topics we got 30 minutes left let's get into it
(4:55:22) let's keep stalling yeah just keep going okay
(4:55:29) uh it can you be sexist against
() 
(4:55:44) men that was some good timing I believe that sexism racism
(4:55:54) these these General large topics have systemic
(4:55:59) impact okay and because of that in rout I believe that discrimination can happen
(4:56:05) to anyone but these systems that are in place for things like sexism have an
(4:56:15) oppression factor from the systems that are set in place and people that benefit more versus the other and so I believe
(4:56:23) that men can be discriminated against but I do not believe that women can be
(4:56:29) sexist towards men can men be sexist towards other other
(4:56:37) men I mean they can be they can be like what's the word I'm looking for I
(4:56:43) guess like manderas towards men well can can women be sexist towards other women yeah
(4:56:50) terized misogyny yeah okay a lot of buzzword coming here before I have anybody respond to that I want to get
(4:56:57) I'll go around the table and and you also said I'll just double up on the question can you be racist towards white
(4:57:02) people if you can just straighten into the mic
(4:57:08) by the very definition you just used by well just go ahead just and like I mean at the end of the day I'm not really
(4:57:15) super interested in having a heated back and forth debate on my beliefs on this because they're just my beliefs and I
(4:57:22) could be related to dating somehow you know if you were dating Ian I person dating a light person it could be
(4:57:30) related what if the sexism question definitely is I personally do not use
(4:57:36) race as a factor of Attraction so like I will I'm I would date any race I race is
(4:57:43) not something that is a yay or a Nay it's just a aspect of someone's person
(4:57:49) and I am the kind of we call it ethnicity is that okay are we not all just human or yeah I mean race and
(4:57:55) ethnicity are different correct and we are R I can agree should I just assume that your answer is no you cannot be
(4:58:01) racist against white people that's my belief yes do you want Oh you could have just so wait yeah I mean in short yes do
(4:58:09) you want to just say it yourself just so I'm not I don't want to speak for you I
(4:58:14) mean I'm agreeing with your point I don't know why I have to verb I just you know okay far yes I think you could be
(4:58:21) sexist against men and racist against white people okay why you look don't look at me that
(4:58:28) way what the  start start with can you be sexist
(4:58:33) against men and can you be racist against white people the way that I mean
(4:58:39) what she's saying the way that it's supposed to be set up or my understanding of it and I find to be
(4:58:44) corrected on this but my understanding that is that I don't really know that much about sexism as far as like if
(4:58:50) they're the exact same just via sex then okay but racism you have to hold the
(4:58:55) hierarchy in a society because then you benefit from the the constructs that
(4:59:02) were put in the societ so that's the reason why you could be racist so if you're not benefiting from it then you
(4:59:07) couldn't be racist from it so if those are the same then I guess by that definition no but I would have to do
(4:59:13) further thought on that I would say um no uh you can't be
(4:59:20) sexist to men and yes you could be racist to a white person wait you so you
(4:59:26) can't be sexist towards men no I feel like you just want to be
(4:59:32) different no I think it depends where you're at too right and I feel like I thought she's a based Catholic she was until she
(4:59:40) said that until she said that said that um so wait you can't be sexist
(4:59:46) towards these are even questions well I guess it depends on where you at right so like if you're in Trinidad you could be racist towards a white
(4:59:53) person okay so location matters yes well I feel cuz I've been like well where I'm
(4:59:59) at where I stay um there's like people that are like racist to white people
(5:00:07) they could they probably but okay but what but it seems like you acknowledge that you can't be racist towards white people but I'm trying to delve into the
(5:00:14) can't be sexist towards men I just feel
(5:00:21) like I don't know how to explain myself that well
(5:00:26) um I don't know I just feel like you can't like I just don't think so you
(5:00:32) know you know I don't know how to explain how might somebody be sexist towards a
(5:00:43) woman can I skip skip you want to skip yeah I'm getting be would it be easier
(5:00:50) to do to do it in Spanish it's okay no can you say it in
(5:00:55) Spanish I can understand yeah oh no can you speak Spanish no not at all I was
(5:01:01) going to wait for her to like do the whole thing and Spanish and then tell her I didn't speak Spanish I just thought that would be hilarious you
(5:01:07) can't skip I just thought it' be funny you can
(5:01:13) go but it didn't work out Madison you toward a woman that's how you can be sex
(5:01:19) towards Asian there we goly um yes and yes okay uh yeah and
(5:01:26) yeah absolutely yes to both yeah yeah yes yes to both sure yes
(5:01:34) to both so okay we obviously clearly there's a few people who disagree here on both of these uh let's let's talk it
(5:01:41) out here let's see what where we we can arrive at I have I quick question maybe to kick it
(5:01:46) off when you say um so I understand I think kind of like your general argument
(5:01:52) is to say white people have um maybe like institutional or systemic power and
(5:01:59) you can't be racist unless you have that power okay okay that's what I was saying but you could be bigoted for sure okay
(5:02:07) morally is being bigoted and being racist the same um I don't know end the mic I don't
() 
(5:02:16) know like are they the equivalent so if you're bigoted towards somebody or you're racist towards somebody is one
(5:02:21) can you define what you mean by is one worse than the other can you define what like what the definitions are for for
(5:02:26) well for you bigoted would just mean you're you're doing what the white person would be doing to the black
(5:02:32) person person that's racist in Reverse but that can't be racist so you're calling it bigoted so that's how I would describe
(5:02:39) that phenomenon but I think that so like let's say let's say um if somebody said
(5:02:45) the nword towards a black person you would consider that racist right um if if white dude said like the
(5:02:54) hard art in word to I would consider him to be racist so that would be so he would be racist but if the reverse
(5:03:01) happened and they said like uh you know yeah exactly you would just say that that's bigoted right well the thing
(5:03:08) is is that when you I mean sure but I think the the difference
(5:03:13) is that when you call someone a cracker they could be like oh you're offending me but it's not going to stop them from
(5:03:19) moving forward where historically the other word does yeah I get okay I
(5:03:24) understand the argument there but what I'm asking is are they morally equivalent or is one worse than the
(5:03:31) other because I I associate racism with violence for me yeah but I mean bigot
(5:03:37) bigotry could lead to violence for sure but I don't associate him like I just from I I don't like they might be that's
(5:03:43) why I ask you what your definition is well I mean by your definition if somebody was doing the racial thing in
(5:03:48) Reverse but you can't call it racism because there's no systemic power right they could definitely be doing that and
(5:03:54) have done it for violent reasons so the association's definitely there right so
(5:04:00) as far as a moral equivalency goes I'm just trying to figure out how is one worse or more immoral than the other one
(5:04:06) oh yeah I did I mean it's for me that would still be a negative yes yeah but are they equally
(5:04:13) immoral or is one more immoral than the other um I think it would depend on the
(5:04:19) action like if you call me the nword and I call you a cracker I think yours probably would be more moral than my
(5:04:26) maybe should we say the c word is that wrong I feel like we got it I think you can't be racist you can't be racist
(5:04:32) probably say the I'm also white so right well you can't do that on might be might
(5:04:38) be I didn't know she didn't know might let's just be careful talking about fools I was
(5:04:45) talking yeah so you think that the the racism in that point is worse than the
(5:04:50) bigotry it's a it's morally worse because of the history that comes
(5:04:57) with it I probably would feel that way yeah but what's interesting about this and this is why I asked
(5:05:03) say for any other action that I can think of and I've thought about this a
(5:05:08) lot if there's any other action which comes up that you just kind of rename
(5:05:13) the thing which is the same exact thing as the other thing you just don't give it the same qualifier they're always equally immoral
(5:05:21) I can't I can't think of a single one that I can make that application to where it's not equally as bad because
(5:05:28) we're basically just calling it something else even though it's exactly the the same set of actions can you
(5:05:34) think of any I like for instance if a husband cheated and a wife cheated is
(5:05:40) that that's equally bad right I but if um if a a woman hurt a dog and a man
(5:05:48) hurt a dog that's equally bad right but if a white person is racist and a black
(5:05:53) person is racist you say bigotry for the black person being racist that's not equally bad I don't think it's not I
(5:06:00) think that when someone being negative I just it's already bad like I won't encourage that but with the history that
(5:06:07) comes with it there's just even like epigenetics like there's certain like
(5:06:12) feelings you'll even get that's going to be deeper rooted um and the connotation that comes with it is just going to be
(5:06:18) more like for instance if someone calls me fat I can decide to give that word
(5:06:23) like I can decide to give that word meaning and that can hurt my feelings or I could be like oh it doesn't really matter and I feel like when you're white
(5:06:30) and you get called that you have the choice of being like oh it doesn't doesn't really matter and when you're black you don't really get that choice
(5:06:36) what prevents you from having that choice the way you feel about the word how the word the history of the word the history of the things the way you feel
(5:06:43) is not a choice but the way you feel is still going to be affected by what happened
(5:06:48) yeah that's true but isn't how you feel the choice it's still going to be affected by what happened yeah I don't understand though because you're what
(5:06:54) you said earlier just like seconds ago was it's not really a choice and I said
(5:07:00) why isn't it a choice you said cuz it's how you feel and I said isn't how you feel a choice you say yes I mean the
(5:07:07) choice it's not really a choice as far as like the history that already comes with the word so like it it already
(5:07:14) that's already a staple there wasn't people being murdered based on the c-word there wasn't people being uh r
(5:07:20) word based on the CW there wasn't whole civilization being wiped out based on the CW but there was based on the N word
(5:07:27) so I'm more curious about the sexist thing though wait I want want to say one thing kind of an analogy I'm not saying
(5:07:33) I subscribe to this but I think the argument is more like it's not like one person hitting another they see it more like if um certain races have been
(5:07:40) subject to like systemic discrimination they see it more like you've already been hit 10 times and if one more hit is
(5:07:46) going to hurt you more than someone who has never been hit you will be charged differently for that so I think that's how they but how come you don't ascribe
(5:07:51) to that um because I don't know if every single person is like carrying that like
(5:07:57) historic load I'm just saying that's the argument they don't see so what she's saying a good point if somebody came
(5:08:04) over let's say um who had was not in the United States let's say for more than
(5:08:11) like six months right you would agree with me that the word that word would have to impact them less then right yeah
(5:08:19) it does actually yeah so I mean if it does then does that mean that you can be uh or that person if that particular
(5:08:27) person could they be racist to white people for sure for sure because I mean depending
(5:08:33) on where they're they're they're so black people so then black people can be racist towards white people I never said
(5:08:39) they couldn't my statement was my my statement was that it depends on where they're located so well they're located
(5:08:46) here right but if so but if they're not from here if they're from Dominican Republic then they're them being out
(5:08:53) here and them being out there is going to be different they're still black people right yes okay well then black
(5:08:59) people can hear be racist to white people not if they're for me that my
(5:09:04) understanding of the word racist means that you have the systematic um benefit hierarchy and so that's my understanding
() 
(5:09:11) of the word racism I have a question on that real I do have one question you you're talking about a hierarchy right
(5:09:17) so for example could let's say when Barack Obama was President could
(5:09:24) he have a racist view against a white homeless
(5:09:31) person the president of the United States who's
(5:09:36) arguably the most powerful person in the world could he have a racist view on say
(5:09:42) a white homeless person who so I guess yeah is that I don't know if that's a good I don't understand I don't know
(5:09:48) well I guess that makes sense cuz the person that sits at top of the hierarchy is black therefore during his
(5:09:56) administration white people could not have been racist against black people but black people could have been racist
(5:10:02) against white people because he sat at top the hierarchy this system was still set by white people having a he's still
(5:10:08) subscribing to a white system system the systemic issue but I'm I'm asking specifically him as an individual as a
(5:10:15) black subscribing to a white system he's still living by the as the President of the United States who has the most who's
(5:10:22) the most powerful person also and we know that President doesn't make the end he I mean there's a whole Congress like and there's a whole checks and balances
(5:10:28) whole do you think a white homeless do you think a white homeless person has more power and privilege than Congress a
(5:10:34) black president of the United States I think in some people's eyes yeah which is unfortunate white homeless
(5:10:41) person I think that's that's racism like there's many people in many KKK people
(5:10:46) are going to appreciate the white homeless personid the KKK have no power in this country whatsoever I'm just
(5:10:51) talking about racism but that's racism well they don't have power though so by your definition but they do have power
(5:10:59) the KKK have influ for sure hey Nick can you pull up the in uh the
(5:11:05) podcast that would be like saying though that if there was a white president the Black Panthers didn't like it was the same argument but black panther black
(5:11:11) panthers are not the same even close to the same kind of group as the KKK we not make that at I'm not even disputing that
(5:11:19) histo that's historically factually true you're right about that but but it's still the same argument to say the
(5:11:24) reason that we would value this more still is because there's some people in society who would still value the white
(5:11:31) bum more than the black president and it's like okay but that's going to be true the opposite way too so that makes
(5:11:38) no sense the system still only benefits one side I have only think so mainly
(5:11:43) mainly benefit I've got a couple photos that we can react to that are related to this Nick so I want you to pull up the I
(5:11:50) believe these should be ordered the same for both of us there the third one fourth one fifth one and sixth
(5:11:56) one uh the first one starts with CSU V do you see it
(5:12:02) so just load the uh third fourth fifth six is it
(5:12:08) aie they're not not that great the cookies are not that great it's taking you like an hour to
(5:12:15) eat you got you got just do one it just get the first
() 
(5:12:21) one going all right uh the world according to a
(5:12:26) feminist uh so you got the women can you make us a little bigger a little bigger
(5:12:31) put us on the other corner corner just Corner us Corner us corner here is the
(5:12:37) is there another Corner okay just give us do the small one please small small small yeah and
(5:12:44) make make it bigger okay uh the world according to a
(5:12:49) feminist all those look at those women and then there's the guy who the homeless guy privileged you know okay
(5:12:56) all right that's you know but you have to understand though that all of the systems are set up for him yeah
(5:13:01) apparently um they are and the fact that he failed is incredible oh my God I
(5:13:07) guess okay if it worked like that I mean like
(5:13:12) just no notes well hold on first off there's affirmative action for women so
(5:13:17) that's a system that benefits women thank God what system helps men it's not clear to me here pull up there's more
(5:13:23) there's more the um white male privilege the cons who whoa whoa whoa let's be
(5:13:29) careful there all right we in what in the con ution benefits white men specifically created equal does that not
(5:13:35) include black what do you guys think about this this is a
(5:13:41) d does anybody noticing three4 of men and black men
(5:13:48) became if you want to talk about the time it also didn't include it included some white men that's it so if we talk
(5:13:55) about the intent of the founding fathers they the intent and you can go to Thomas
(5:14:01) Jefferson's letters to specific individuals talking about how he wanted to make the language
(5:14:07) in the Constitution more broad to include literally every single person
(5:14:12) well he was an abolitionist yeah and so exactly he was an abolitionist he hated slavery and he actively tried to release
(5:14:18) all of his slaves but was legally not allowed to do so until he died in which
(5:14:24) he did so there there is this like pervasive verbiage in usually the left
(5:14:31) side side of the political spectrum that likes to paint the Founding Fathers as
(5:14:36) extremely racist and writing the Constitution as something to oppress
(5:14:42) minorities and oppress specific gender so women which
(5:14:47) is not the case you have them with the intent to release those people of those
(5:14:53) systemic oppressions that they uh that they experienced in other countries so
(5:14:59) like in England mean religious oppression the slave trade all of those things they wrote the verbiage in the
(5:15:07) Constitution so that eventually we would get to a point where we're sitting here today where people would be able to read
(5:15:13) that verbiage and see all men are created equal and we can sit here and know that they meant all men are created
(5:15:20) equal there's some more photos we got you didn't even see that second photo Nick if you can pull up the photo thank
(5:15:25) you Kate for the 10 memberships white white we often hear male privilege white
(5:15:30) privilege you know what I think every feminist should watch All Quiet on the Western
(5:15:38) Front and then decide if there's male privilege uh wait there's more photos we got more photos that's the D-Day Landing
(5:15:44) that I don't know if that's I mean to be fair to that one um there was a lot of
(5:15:50) black men who fought in World War II abolutely that is true I'm not yes there
(5:15:56) were there was the the Harlem Hell fighters in World War I and yeah um Nick
(5:16:01) pull up please uh oh there's this chat here I'll just read they have done the studies on
(5:16:06) the DNA test wait no no no okay never just pull up the photo I'll read it later the world according to a feminist
(5:16:14) oppressed privileged yeah that's also true there's actually a lot of Truth the theme of
(5:16:20) these photos is just the there's much there's just the complete like dation of
(5:16:25) a Nuance just they just lack Nuance in its entirety because the whole the whole
(5:16:31) aspect of like oppression versus privilege when you speak about privilege privilege people like to hyperfocus on
(5:16:38) the standard definition of privilege being about like how much money you have like how much access you have to
(5:16:43) resources things like that wherein privilege much like much of the English language is a word that can have
(5:16:49) multiple meanings and in this context privilege is more about um
(5:16:55) the societal systematic aspect where
(5:17:00) which is a general morality and not down to the individual and these are focusing on like the individual stereotypes and
(5:17:09) archetypes calling it e ecological fallacy everyone start talking at once what are you basically calling it an
(5:17:16) ecological fallacy I don't want to say yes cuz I'm I'm not sure what that means clar when
(5:17:23) you take the individual and then you attribute it to the general po okay well then I would say yes I'm just not familiar with the term are you talking
(5:17:29) about Apex fency no it's the ecologic eological meical eological it's the eological
(5:17:35) fallacy okay I can see how the word deres yeah okay that makes sense to me that yeah that sounds right well here
(5:17:41) pull up the last photo and then we got the last one I think there's one more we got one more scroll up make it bigger uh
(5:17:48) yep so I don't know lot of Truth in that one too stop oppressing me sorry you
(5:17:56) know uh you know male privilege and he even apologize for something he didn't do wrong because class privilege and
(5:18:02) oppression is not about race but they all are factors within each other point the point isn't that he's at work the
(5:18:07) point is the kind of work he's doing MH the kind of work he's doing is not the kind of work that women do pretty much ever anywhere at any time for any reason
(5:18:15) that's that's the privilege so the Privileges are you systematically oppressed why your sewers are taking
(5:18:21) care of for you why you have air conditioning why you live in modernity and all modern technology and every
(5:18:26) dangerous job on planet Earth is done by men is that oppressive having a
(5:18:31) baby is a pretty dangerous job resp no it's not it's very safe job how are you going to say that because I can look at
(5:18:36) infant mortality rates and from pregnant from pregnant women and the the
(5:18:42) mortality rates of the mother is a very safe job very very safe for women to have the
(5:18:48) differen is okay like you're doing that that's your job and then we've got our own job like that's okay yeah you do you
(5:18:54) have a job um but you demand to have also egalitarianism inside Society
(5:19:00) between the sexes the thing is is like your job is clearly far less valuable than our job because without us
(5:19:07) maintaining the entirety of the infrastructure for which women's pampered asses can even uh exist inside
(5:19:14) of society they would collapse and how do I know this because I have 2200 years
(5:19:20) of History to look at to watch the progression of them literally folding like cheap chairs and being passed
(5:19:26) between enemy armies like it was nothing they were literally ch attle if we
(5:19:32) decided that they were and instead we have massive amounts of technological uh advancements which have allowed for
(5:19:39) women to even exist in modernity and instead of being praised for it men are
(5:19:44) treated like absolute garbage for doing I you guys are great Brian you should have brought up my video that I had
(5:19:49) responding to this I I had a video I posted a um video with when it asked uh
(5:19:54) a woman was asked who did she think was better or who was stronger or what were women better at than men and she said
(5:20:02) everything and I responded to that wait was it on the show no no I I I posted I
(5:20:07) had um resp is it on your Instagram or Tik Tok yeah it's like a one minute reaction is it pretty we can we can pull it up I can send it I can send it to the
(5:20:15) the DM to the whatever DM yeah or we can just try to search for what it's on your Instagram yeah it's on my Instagram is it pretty close to the top it should be
(5:20:22) Nick just pull up his Instagram that's probably the easiest uh you can also send a message
(5:20:27) send the actual video to the the whatever Instagram and Nick can also so pull it up that way um oh yeah I found
(5:20:34) it already Okay oh he already he's he's already got it yeah you can send it through he's on it send it he is on it
(5:20:43) uh good talk good talk okay so what do you guys think about um birth control
(5:20:50) who show of hands who's on birth control just curious anybody on birth control I've never been on birth control anybody
(5:20:57) birth control birth I did the I once okay I just I just send it Nick all right Nick
() 
(5:21:02) if you can pull that up that's not a fun oh while Nick is pulling that up hold on we very off see you
(5:21:09) cost donated $200 both the KKK and black panthers were co-opted by the FBI Co inel Pro in
(5:21:17) order to divide the Races they have a lot in
(5:21:22) common oh theot toos thank you Mane thank you thank you it's actually a pretty good point now that I think about
(5:21:29) it all right we we have uh hold on I'll just show this one really quick and then we'll pull up the uh the video we have
(5:21:37) Joe the giant they have done studies on the DNA test conversation from earlier it showed 33% of children are not with
(5:21:43) their real fathers and the fathers have no clue I just want to just so we can be factual
(5:21:49) here the numbers that you're referencing it's not it's not looking at the entire
(5:21:55) population it's the study is they're looking at the cohort of men who have
(5:22:01) who have SE to to get paternity testing so of course that's going to likely
(5:22:07) yield a higher represent because they they see in their partner attendance like their behaviors that would lead
(5:22:14) them to indicate that there's been I think it's 33% among all married couples
(5:22:21) but of the men who do challenge paternity it is uh I don't know if I'm
(5:22:27) just going to take your word for it that is 33% but yeah uh Nick you got the
(5:22:32) video but that would show though that it's it's likely vastly under reported
(5:22:38) yes absolutely absolutely it does it does give me reason to be like okay I want a Pity
(5:22:45) test oh hold on hold on we'll juston donated $100 Andrew how can you say having a
(5:22:52) baby is a safe job almost every woman I know that's had a baby has ended up in
(5:22:58) the hospital because of the pregnancy Fe
(5:23:03) what was I thinking safest job ever sorry most unsafe they all ended up
(5:23:10) in the hospital all right we can pull up the video was so safe the hospital wouldn't be needed but okay I mean it's not you
(5:23:17) can have your babies at home we did it for thousands of years death R higher for women yeah the infant mortality rate
(5:23:24) was usually due to infections and post postmortem right and that's what the
(5:23:30) hospital prevents yeah okay but you can prevent it now too because you have this cool thing called an alcohol pad and you
(5:23:35) understand how infections work and so the thing is it's like plenty of women go ahead and have babies at home and the
(5:23:44) postmortem not really a problem I would actually be fasinated to see like in the
(5:23:49) US now for the people who choose to have their babies at home what is the infant mortality rate compared to having in the
(5:23:55) hospital they also have probably a midwife too they're not going to I'd be interested to know that by themselves
(5:24:01) anym especially with especially with like current legislation like we would be held liable if things went wrong well
(5:24:08) no all I'm saying is like I just want to like given like a having Sol like
(5:24:15) Medical Solutions at home like I know I know people specifically who choose to have home Birds I want to have if I ever
(5:24:21) I want home so like I just I'm intrigued to know what that statistic would be just so I could be able like to see if
(5:24:27) anything's changed or like what yeah I get I mean I I agree I be interested too did you mean postpartum instead of
(5:24:34) postmortem oh yeah postpartum just wanted I saw some chats there just wanted to clarify um okay up is this the
(5:24:41) one yeah yeah I just break it down and ask a simple
(5:24:47) question audio would be helpful you'll probably need a re re can you make it a little bigger
(5:24:54) also H Instagram's so whack their audio player it's dog
() 
(5:25:00) or their video player my bad women are better than men at everything everything guys are super now
(5:25:06) I'm not going to respond to this all crazy but what we are going to do is create a scenario let's say that everything that a male human has ever
(5:25:12) discovered built constructed thought of innovated renovated created gone
(5:25:18) obliterated instantaneously everywhere on the face of the planet technological advancements Transportation the power
(5:25:25) grid infrastructure stem medicine all of it gone eradicated now to to mention Law
(5:25:31) and Order and protection I'm talking dog breeds Newton's laws of motion and energy held of Pythagorean theorem go
(5:25:38) even the animals including the Predators that been drove to Extinction reintroduced and now women have to reconstruct Society from the ground up
(5:25:45) without the aid of a man or anything that a man invented that includes instructions as well and women have to
(5:25:51) accomplish this either pregnant or men stated men are incapable of doing anything to help now What Becomes of
(5:25:57) society and Humanity within just one year then
(5:26:02) okay also we have we had a chat here that came in from theot toos thank you man Lumber workers have 10x higher death
(5:26:08) rates than mothers everything is a lie uh Q did you want to add anything to the
(5:26:14) video or no no it was all laid out right there okay so this is a this is a thought experiment and it's an excellent
(5:26:21) thought experiment and so that I've I've made similar thought experiments as well
(5:26:26) and so have thousands of other people who's just kind of saying yeah had a wand and all the men were gone tomorrow
(5:26:33) for whatever reason how could Society maintain itself
(5:26:38) absent men and when you really start to break down thought experiment you start to
(5:26:43) dive into all the jobs that they do everything that they're into uh the distinctions in just skill-based not to
(5:26:50) mention the physiological differences like the fact that women really can't do a lot of the men's jobs that's one of
(5:26:55) the big things that is a big lie too women really can't they're not even physiologically equipped to be outside
(5:27:02) for long periods of time doing things like Roofing asphalt laying their body can't even regulate temperature the same
(5:27:08) way so what happens is society after one year to answer to your thought experiment is completely destroyed and
(5:27:16) 99% of the life on it is gone with it that's what I think or human life I
(5:27:22) think animal life it's got plenty to eat it's that's why I say the Predators
(5:27:28) that we drove to Extinction reintroduced yep far you got I thought you had
(5:27:34) thoughts on this topic I said you could be sexist towards men oh what that okay
(5:27:39) yeah no no but what Andrew just said like I guess I would hesitate much EMP
(5:27:44) you dunked on me you you clip you did a little clip on me like cuz I was like I said oh yeah would hit the fan if
(5:27:51) all men disappeared he gets so mad at me cuz comment call him stupid I'm not mad at you I'm not mad I'm just reeling you
(5:27:58) into the conversation now that you had 6 months to digest our argument you want to bring it back up what you what was
() 
(5:28:05) that 6 months ago how's that relevant at all I don't know why it's fresh on your mind what are you talk we're literally
(5:28:11) talking about the topic at hand it just seems kind of fresh we' yes I'm deeply
(5:28:16) I'm deeply triggered by he's been like seting for six months waiting it's just
(5:28:21) like you have a show three times a week with 10 new people and it just seemed like I don't know elephant
(5:28:27) memory compliment that he remembers it after doing shows where there's 10 but
(5:28:33) yeah I mean I would agree with you I think like men are generally undervalued and I think feminists do kind of absorb
(5:28:38) and regurgitate a lot of buzzwords without understanding like where those arguments actually came from in feminist literature I would hesitate to put too
(5:28:44) much emphasis in male bronze because the labor force you know what I mean is Shifting towards valuing brains over bronze and I think that's why we're
(5:28:50) that's a destiny argument I get from him yeah but he's wrong I didn't just like you're wrong about it it's actually not
(5:28:56) the fact of the matter is that we're not really able to replace Braun very well all for instance for instance where's
(5:29:03) all of our robotic roofers you ever seen one I'm sure we'll get there soon oh wait really how how do you think that
(5:29:09) they're going to you're going to get robot roofers to go to people's individual houses and Patch roofs I
(5:29:14) don't know we have like military robots now I wasn't even disputing your point that men should be valued more I was more so just saying that like I think
(5:29:20) the reason men are struggling partly is because they're feeling like a sense of cultural redundancy because a lot of the
(5:29:26) labor market is focusing on brains over bronze and women are out actually happened was that women were told to go
(5:29:31) to college College was highly overvalued and now as everybody can do it the market is becoming inundated because
(5:29:39) it's tailored to the lowest common denominator meaning if you lower the standards so that everybody can do it
(5:29:45) right the standards necessarily become lower to accommodate the most amount of people so more and more people got a
(5:29:51) college degree the Market's completely saturated with it but it wasn't before so women accelerated but you'll see that
(5:29:58) that Gap it's closing is closing quickly and you see the Gap in pay with trades
(5:30:03) between even stem Fields that's closing quickly too it's going to continue to close because we can't actually get rid
(5:30:10) of the big thing which is the brawn the thing women can't bring to the table
(5:30:15) which is they can't they can't do road work they can't do Roofing they can't do any of the really intrinsic or hard
(5:30:23) bronze based labor don't you think a lot of those jobs have diminished over time because now things are getting built and
(5:30:29) they're like architecture is sustaining for a long time so I feel like those jobs are becoming smaller top two jobs
(5:30:35) that you would say for men that you would want immigrants to come in and do what what do you think I don't
(5:30:41) understand wait what do you think that male immigrants when they come in right for work you would want more of them to
(5:30:47) come in and work and expand the economy what would you say the male immigrants usually do usually
(5:30:56) Doh I I genuinely don't know what would you think
(5:31:01) you're in you're in California and there's kind of something stereotyp yeah
(5:31:06) the general stereotype of what immigrants who come in from South of the Border are doing is what dishwashing no
(5:31:13) something paid under the table they work in farms they were literally work on fun the it's like the most famous thing in
(5:31:19) California ever is that they work it's everywhere even that number is going down like used to be 90% of Americans are farmers and my point is like now
(5:31:25) it's shrinking it's my point okay yeah yeah yeah but the the my point to you back is that it's an ever expanding
(5:31:30) field a necessary ever expanding field because people need to eat yes because the amount of people
(5:31:37) that are necessary to feed the amount of people necessarily grows so it's expanding expanding expanding now with a
(5:31:42) birth rate contraction we might have problems with that later and we will but what I'm saying is that with that expansion of people comes the expansion
(5:31:48) of necessity of houses and all those other things that grow the GDP that progressives like you and Destiny would
(5:31:54) love to have happen so much which means that no you're going to have to actually expand the
(5:32:00) and that's what you're going to see his projection totally wrong and that projection there of eliminating The
(5:32:06) Braun or moving away from Braun that's not true we're moving towards it again there was a a limited market saturation
(5:32:12) now that's changing again I genuinely have not heard him say that like I do my own research and reading but um come on
(5:32:18) far I genuinely don't come on far I'm kidding I'm joking that was a funny joke I feel like I always have to wipe his
(5:32:23) piss off of me cuz I feel like people think cuz we're friends I like absorb his arguments but like we do not coign
(5:32:30) on each other's arguments well that's a destiny argument just so you know okay I'm not saying that you got it from him
(5:32:36) I'm just saying something I hear him regurgitate when he's arguing I mean we probably read some of the same stuff but
(5:32:41) um yeah like I said I wasn't trying to undervalue the necessity for like bronze and like manual labor I was more so
(5:32:47) saying that like I think just treating the value of masculinity as just being synonymous with bronze I feel like is
(5:32:53) just only responding to like a very marginal percent of like what men are doing is my point because that's going
(5:32:59) down yeah we're not really associating masculinity with Brawn as much as talking about the necessity of Braun in
(5:33:05) society Butler donated $100 Brian how can you let the girl in
(5:33:11) red tell you 10 men ran a train on her without mentioning condoms do not protect from genital herpes and she
(5:33:18) definitely has it I've in CDC incoming nuke isn't that the dude always makes

(5:33:57) necks and then electrical worker uh why don't you pull those up we
(5:34:04) also got one do we do the Burge Khalifa one nah it's okay we don't have to do that one if you can get all those pulled
(5:34:09) up um send me that video you made videos men and then IR iron workers Ru next
(5:34:16) electrical worker I don't it's podcast videos okay
(5:34:23) no you're in the wrong it's podcast videos men in the Dropbox folder so so hold on while you do that
() 
(5:34:30) I'm going to get some I'll I'll do some chats Nick can you pull up the OBS please so we
(5:34:36) can uh oh wait hold on I'll come back to that okay Bean cheeks does far aware frames without glasses Liberals are not
(5:34:42) intellectuals with your social media talk on sex you keep outing yourself as being non virgin you can keep up the act
(5:34:48) for simps but real man real man see through the BS not real men also is your
(5:34:54) dental hygiene bad I never see you smile I feel like I smile sometimes um if I was trying to like keep up some Act of
(5:35:00) being a virgin why would I be currently turning out content of skits where I talk about having high body counts like
(5:35:06) if it was an act why would I be putting out the content that he says counteracts me being a virgin it just doesn't make any sense is that the old like hideout
(5:35:13) in the right in the open right they're just like referring to like skits I put
(5:35:18) out yeah um they're not taking in the context okay it's iron workers power
(5:35:26) line snow rough necks electrical worker oil rig that's five videos they're all kind of
(5:35:33) right in close proximity to the other here okay while you do that bean
(5:35:40) cheeks the KKK does have power but in the form of the Democrats if you do not know that look up the history on the
(5:35:46) party that created the KKK and then tell me if you still a left-leaning Democrat if so you f fully support the KKK as
(5:35:54) they oppress blacks mhm from beating cheeks there you have it folks thank you
(5:36:00) cheeks appreciate it brother we have llama dis Sky Mar c buku for the
(5:36:06) Canadian 50 I've worked in tech for years Braun will not be replaced because it's still cheaper to hire a man roofer
(5:36:12) than to operate and maintain an advanced robot to do the job to the same level it's actually easier to replace the
(5:36:18) simpler brain jobs right that's actually very true yep okay interesting thank you
(5:36:25) uh thank you there uh you got them Nick soers workers State Building those are
(5:36:31) pulled up and then uh you said Steel Workers Local steel workers and then

(5:37:10) men come on Nick come on said multi I said multiple time all
(5:37:17) right um okay here we have another chat here uh modest Tama we know some of the
(5:37:23) panel doesn't live in reality already panel what is a woman
() 
(5:37:30) I guess we'll go around the table on this what is a
(5:37:38) woman I feel like I'm walking into a trap with this crew of people here you
(5:37:43) said trap I'm just Kidd but um I would say being a woman is
(5:37:50) more than biological I think that's female versus male I think being a woman
(5:37:57) is um an identity and something
(5:38:02) that you
(5:38:08) know I don't quite know how to explain it I just feel like it's something
(5:38:17) that yeah I don't know I'm blanking actually I'm
(5:38:23) sorry you're asking me I'm going to pass for
(5:38:28) now what okay
(5:38:36) um a woman someone who was born with the correct
(5:38:42) chromosomes correct to makes them a
(5:38:49) woman um I agree with M Misty um a woman
(5:38:55) is someone that is born of W so you know

(5:39:37) here wait just mute the audio just mute the audio all right okay scary scary
(5:39:45) right yeah they're indeed I see two men probably all right okay and then you
(5:39:51) have the operators and yeah uh next video Nick you can pause that one oh I
(5:39:56) just wanted iron workers one which videos do you have pulled up just X out of that Y which which tell me which ones
(5:40:04) you have pulled up and I'll two and then oil rig and then the
(5:40:10) last one was okay I need here we already looked at iron workers one I need
(5:40:15) electrical worker oil rig Powerline snow rough
(5:40:22) necks just can you get one going one of them going yeah yeah I
(5:40:27) have such a juicy after
(5:40:32) that it sounded sarcastic all right we got look at there's a look at that you
(5:40:37) can maybe one bigger so it's full screen like full screen I think you could probably go one
(5:40:43) more maybe is it moving or just the ocean around it yeah I think is there currently men
(5:40:50) on moving it's probably it's probably all men on there okay I think the camera's moving next one no so the
(5:40:58) actual PL platform it's is moving right it's to something so yeah no it's its
(5:41:04) Center of mass is below the surface of the ocean so it doesn't like wobble side to side but it goes up and down go ahead
(5:41:11) Nick you can next y all right oh hell
(5:41:17) no no the no no no all right so here's a guy on a a power line I believe he's in
(5:41:24) I believe this is uh in China and it's snowing
(5:41:30) and he's connected to it it's probably what 100 100 plus foot drop probably more Lally crap myself that's so scary
(5:41:37) and uh he's connected oh is he disconnecting himself from his or wait I
(5:41:43) don't know I can he's disconnecting himself he can reconnect himself on the other side yeah how far down does that
(5:41:50) look uh that's pretty far hundreds of feet
(5:41:55) so oh he he is somewhat you know in the snow crazy that's wild
(5:42:05) anxiety okay he's fixing something on the power line okay next one we got got another one pretty simple
(5:42:12) job we got another one we got another one here got uh what what do we got got the you know the other ones you
(5:42:21) know the other ones definitely
(5:42:28) yeah
(5:42:36) these men are like willfully doing these jobs or they like just they just have
(5:42:41) they pay really well it's not even clear to me if they pay all that well but here
(5:42:47) Electrical uh electrical work or rough neck in China I don't know man they
(5:42:53) might be forced to do it it's more like uh they got a sniper on the Ridge and if you don't do your job you might not see
(5:42:58) your family that's how it looks it's so sad I mean they gave him a safety
(5:43:05) harness yeah exactly be fine yeah a loop around the thing you might fall off of
(5:43:12) is not uh skip to like a minute 25 even that would break some make it bigger oh
(5:43:17) my gosh especially in the cold
(5:43:24) yeah uh play it
(5:43:32) uh skip forward just a little bit yeah that's
(5:43:37) good um oh my gosh so he's on the helicopter fixing a power line I guess
(5:43:43) and I guess he's now attaching himself power line okay all right there's that
(5:43:49) okay all right and then just the IR the rough next one make
(5:43:54) it okay thank God bro
(5:44:01) and then uh skip four I think uh it's you know some all
(5:44:07) right I'm into it these guys look hot oh my God skip skip forward a little bit to
(5:44:15) see the yeah this is all right so this is
(5:44:21) they're thrown around heavy machinery if their hands get coton in it they lose the hand uh you know all right
(5:44:29) they're doing that for you know what 10 hours a day or something
(5:44:37) so not sure why I brought those videos up I I don't no because we were talking
(5:44:43) about infrastructure yeah well so as Society increases and the amount of
(5:44:48) Technology that's needed to sustain society as it increases you're going to need more guys just like that to be able
(5:44:55) to maintain like the power grid to maintain how much oil is necessary uh so
(5:45:01) as we are increasing our electrical need so it when we're starting to incorporate
(5:45:08) all electric cars so as we're moving to more electric okay what Butler donated

() 
(5:46:42) folk thanks for having us thank you for coming that was an interesting
(5:46:47) conversation can I read what Gabby wrote now what what did the apology no it's
(5:46:54) not apology what did she write apology can I read it she sent you more
(5:46:59) tax wait oh God curious what it is you're this not what you okay ready uhoh
(5:47:07) um she said read that out loud okay the Five Guys I asked to be my boyfriend in
(5:47:13) the last episode wait what I don't care I don't care about I don't care about that she should
(5:47:20) have just stuck to her commitment to come on the show instead of last minute taking imagine how like if she had said
(5:47:29) a week ago hey I'm getting a book I'm gonna take a different gig she didn't know until until the day of Happ that
(5:47:37) does happen we we'll be on like hold and then we'll get the booking that day and you got to tell your agent yes and they drop you and respectfully I mean you
(5:47:43) would probably say this do this same what do you mean that you your her agent would drop her if she didn't take that
(5:47:50) no cuz like she get a $1,500 job you say no to the job that's their 10% that they're missing out on 20% yeah but
(5:47:56) you're as the as the as somebody who's familiar with the entertainment industry you as the talent has the agency to pick
(5:48:04) which gigs you do and do not do right but when the agency gets you a gig and you already said yes to it and then you book it then you have to say yes to it
(5:48:11) but she had already committed we had booked this with her month like a month
(5:48:16) I don't know exactly when but a month in do happen I'm going to tell you I I don't know what it really was right but
(5:48:22) if you've already agreed to be on a show you should you should hold to your commitment because you're that should
(5:48:28) have like I get that she wants to make like a $1,500 how much money it was in
(5:48:34) any case she it's I would argue that the right thing to do would be to say even
(5:48:40) though she stands to make more supposedly money you mess up the relationship with the agent no you don't
(5:48:46) yeah you said it if it's a last minute thing she's perfectly within her right to say I've already made a commitment
(5:48:51) that's not how it works the of course that's how it the most you've debated to the booking the booking is last minute
(5:48:57) bro you as the talent you're you're the king you are the king you don't your
(5:49:03) agent no no your agent does not get to dictate where if you take a shoot or not
(5:49:09) if they're a good agency you don't want to risk losing them based no that's not how it works they work for you they do
(5:49:15) work for they work for you you're the tal someone who's had an agent for over 10 years I'm telling you that is how it works I don't know how long you've had
(5:49:20) an agent for I don't have an agent so then we this I my own thing I do my own business all I'm telling you is then I
(5:49:26) promise you grown up in California my whole life like I know I'm familiar like
(5:49:32) yeah like so it's it's I'm I'm here and I love you thank well I
(5:49:39) I do at least want to give you credit because when typically what we have happened when like a friend group if one
(5:49:45) girl cancels The Dominoes just so I'm at least giving you credit for you showing
(5:49:51) up desite show up to things I say I'm going to do however I appreciate that I appr on a paid job you would have flaked
(5:49:57) last minute that's incredibly rude I I understand that I would have but I I also probably would have let you know
(5:50:03) hey look I'm I may be up for a booking this day I cannot I cannot fully come in I would tell you probably but I don't know I don't know I wouldn't have I mean
(5:50:09) I would have booked another day no well I would have just booked other people
(5:50:15) but it's like if you're letting us know day of it's not enough time to secure
(5:50:20) other guests typically you did a great job though look at everybody huh you did a great job though okay ah it's just
(5:50:29) like I know you're upset I'm sorry and Shannon the other like I would have not I don't know her I know but it's just
(5:50:37) like and I offered her a ride and she told me that she should have at least still come I thought she would she told
(5:50:42) me that she uh I don't remember what she said something about she wasn't going to be able to make it and I was like
(5:50:49) okay okay I mean she's full of she just probably got cold feet or something I mean I don't know I don't know her at
(5:50:55) all no it's not your fault but it's just I because you DEC deed to bring up Gabby again I thought I could read a little
(5:51:00) thing I thought you might want to hear about it no I don't if she if she would have had the decency and the etiquette
(5:51:08) to to stick to her commitment then I would have been happy to hear all of her
(5:51:14) dating High jinkx got you but if she's not here you don't want to hear it I don't give frankly I don't give a
(5:51:20) I'm not considering her for rebooking I'm not considering Shannon for rebooking because if you're going to do
(5:51:26) that to us there's there's no guarantee that you're not going to just flake last minute again so I've cannot consider
(5:51:33) them again for future shows it's incredibly rude and disrespectful it's what Shannon did is
(5:51:40) even worse because I I still think what Gabby did is bad to just you've made a commitment something just because
(5:51:46) something better comes along if you have the opportunity to turn down that other
(5:51:52) opportunity and it wouldn't sour anything and whereas it would sour the
(5:51:58) existing commitment that you have then I think you ought to stick to the commitment that you made for example for
(5:52:04) example let's say I agreed to meet somebody for for a date and then a
(5:52:11) hotter chick comes along and says Brian I would like to hang out with you on the exact same date that you already have a
(5:52:18) date this is a hypothetical scenario here bear in mind I would hold my
(5:52:24) commitment to that person and then if I wanted to to go on the date with the other person I'd say maybe there's
(5:52:30) another time we could go on the date what if they said there was no other time you have incredible Integrity
(5:52:36) though that you should be proud of that I I guess I mean it
(5:52:41) just I think the the whatever the paid gig was uh I think it it does more it
(5:52:52) interferes more the harm is better than the gain I guess because by flaking last
(5:52:58) minute on the show The the issues that it causes for our
(5:53:04) production I think is is a greater negative than it is a positive well okay
(5:53:12) I'm whatever it's just we deal with  flakes all the time and it's super annoying and she didn't
(5:53:18) she claimed she had an emergency but now you're telling me that that would be an emergency an emergency yeah how's it an
(5:53:26) emergency well if you I mean we got but when I think when somebody tells me it's an emergency I think they they're having
(5:53:32) some medical thing there's something going on with a family member so not only did she flake on her commitment she
(5:53:37) also lied about it which which people frequently do maybe she was lying to me
(5:53:42) I suspect she's more likely still lying about it I suspect she's she's more likely to lie to me than she is to lie
(5:53:48) to you I mean I don't know but I can tell you that I know she felt really badly about it I'm sure yes I'm sure she
(5:53:54) felt absolutely terrible about it she loves your show she's very excited about it I know like she was hyped and very
(5:54:00) excited she's been checking in and making sure I was going to show up for the longest time cuz I was like yeah I'm going to come but I had like a rehearsal
(5:54:05) before so I know that her thought process that she was very excited about it it's just like her the Shannon girl
(5:54:12) who's friends with her Shannon was the one who was pushing for us to do another plus-size panel which that completely
(5:54:19) fell apart had she been on before I don't know who that girl no she had not been on before but she reached out to us
(5:54:24) asking to be on the show and like it's just shocking to me she wasn't prepared to take a ride with you she was going to
(5:54:31) ride with Gabby she has her own car I believe she has her own car she was going to she said Gabby and come to my
(5:54:37) house really bro there's so there's lies upon lies here because she told me that
(5:54:43) her she was having car trouble oh maybe so I don't know what the truth is I
(5:54:49) don't know what's what's true what's not I know either um look anyways
(5:54:54) I it's just uh we deal one of the major
(5:54:59) issues that we deal with on the show is people being flaky um and it's just causes so much disruption to our
(5:55:06) production it's it's stressful so it's um ah it's just annoying um so
(5:55:15) yeah anyways I just got tilted because you brought her up so whatever um okay
