(0:00) You want the parents to be miserable,
(0:02) not love each other, but stay for the
(0:04) kids. Do you think that is better for
(0:07) kids? Yeah. It's not better for the
(0:08) kids. That's not what the stats show.
(0:11) I'll make you that argument. Not what
(0:12) the stats show. Okay. So, uh again, the
(0:16) whole thing about like, you know, women
(0:17) and single moms and stuff and I can I
(0:20) can see how it has escalated, but
(0:22) there's a lot of factors to it. You
(0:24) know, you're talking about uh kids not
(0:27) having fathers and stuff. I have I can
(0:29) tell you the opposite stories. My my own
(0:31) story the the guy doesn't want to be
(0:33) involved in his in her life and I I'm
(0:35) not going to force him to. Right? So
(0:36) there's a lot and I am actually part of
(0:39) a lot of single moms groups where a lot
(0:42) of these mens don't want to be involved
(0:43) in these kids' lives. It's not the women
(0:46) are stopping them. But you know what?
(0:47) Online we hear always, oh I wanted to
(0:50) see my kid. And the ones that do see
(0:51) them, they see them once a week. If
(0:53) you're saying that women haven't been
(0:55) doing duty, actually women are doing
(0:57) double the duty now. Women go outside,
(0:59) they work and then they come back home
(1:01) and then they have the duty to those
(1:03) kids. But men when they go to work, they
(1:05) come back at home. Sorry, one second. So
(1:08) they don't do all the same things like
(1:10) we got our rights, we got whatever, but
(1:13) men stopped uh they didn't change
(1:15) themselves that you know the physical
(1:17) labor and the whole responsibility of
(1:20) raising a child. You guys don't take
(1:21) that responsibility.
(1:23) We'll kick it over to These are all
(1:25) excellent arguments you're making
(1:26) against feminism and egalitarianism.
(1:28) You're right. The law used to make it
(1:30) mandatory that men had to had to take
(1:33) care of their children. Had to. They had
(1:35) to do it or they went hang on or they
(1:37) went to jail. They had to take care of
(1:39) their wives or they went to jail. That's
(1:41) what the law used to say they had to do.
(1:43) Now they don't have to. You don't have
(1:44) to take care of your wife now. You just
(1:45) leave. On top of that, wives are they're
(1:48) the ones who are doing the initiation of
(1:50) a divorce. And it's not for abuse. The
(1:52) number one reason is irreconcilable
(1:54) differences. He doesn't make me feel
(1:55) warm and fuzzy inside which puts their
(1:58) children at a massive disadvantage in
(2:01) comparison to the rest of society. Okay.
(2:03) You do have to sacrifice your duties and
(2:05) interest on behalf of your children. You
(2:07) say, "Oh, men don't help out with the
(2:08) housework." Well, yeah, if you're stay
(2:09) at home mom, that's your job, lady. He
(2:11) does he does the work. You do the
(2:13) housework. Oh, it's terrible. And by the
(2:15) way, it's a great deal for women to be
(2:17) stay-at-home moms. They only have to do
(2:18) the early maternal years. I have
(2:20) multiple children. It gets way easier as
(2:23) they get older in that department. And
(2:25) most of the time now, you ship your kid
(2:27) off to public school by the time they're
(2:29) six. So, you don't even have them for
(2:31) eight hours out of the day. Don't tell
(2:32) me how rough it is on women. Give me a
(2:34) break. 60 seconds. Okay. So, like I say,
(2:37) it's so easy. Why don't men do it? Let's
(2:39) do it. They do it. They do do it. No,
(2:41) no, no, no, no, no, no. There's more
(2:43) single mothers than there's single
(2:45) fathers. Okay. I By choice. By choice.
(2:48) Let me finish. Well, I want to let's
(2:49) give Mal each for 60 seconds. I
(2:53) literally thought of women that have
(2:54) been divorced in my area in the last few
(2:56) years that I've lived here. And let me
(2:58) tell you, they're exhausted. They're
(3:00) exhausted from working outside. They're
(3:01) exhausted from taking care of the parent
(3:03) uh from for the kids, running them
(3:05) around here, and literally they're
(3:07) tired. That's why you you say like, "Oh,
(3:09) they didn't feel warm and fuzzy
(3:11) anymore." So, you want the parents to be
(3:13) miserable, not love each other, but stay
(3:16) for the kids. Do you think that is
(3:17) better for kids? It's not better for the
(3:20) kids. That's not what the stats show.
(3:22) I'll make you that argument. Not what
(3:24) the stats show.
(3:26) If the woman, the mother is herself
(3:29) miserable in a relationship. If she
(3:31) can't take care of herself, how is she
(3:32) going to take care of the kids? You guys
(3:34) are never there. I have been in like
(3:37) literally, you would rather have an
(3:39) abusive family. these people screaming
(3:42) and yelling and screaming at in front of
(3:44) kids that they think is better than
(3:47) having separate houses. Well, then you
(3:50) have to then you got then Lucy, you got
(3:52) some explaining to do because before we
(3:54) had no fault divorce, most people stayed
(3:57) married and if women were truly these
(3:59) can you stop can you stop talking lady?
(4:02) So if it is the case, lady, that women
(4:04) were in these miserable marriages and
(4:06) they just couldn't leave and that was
(4:08) actually worse for the kids, how come
(4:10) those kids were so much better adjusted
(4:11) with way less mental illness and had way
(4:13) better prospects for their future than
(4:14) our children do right now in single
(4:16) mother households? Can you explain that?
(4:18) Why is it that in single mother
(4:20) households the children have every
(4:22) single multiple disadvantage you could
(4:24) think of including mental illness,
(4:25) homelessness, everything else when in
(4:28) comparison we go back to uh before there
(4:30) was no fault divorce women stayed
(4:31) married that generation of children far
(4:33) better adjusted way less mental illness
(4:35) way less homelessness way better nest
(4:38) eggs they have better advantages in
(4:39) every aspect. So if it is the case that
(4:42) women were just miserable, right, and
(4:44) they shouldn't have stayed at just out
(4:45) of duty because that would affect the
(4:47) kids, it seems to have affected them
(4:49) positively, didn't it? So the thing is
(4:51) is like these two parent households, we
(4:53) see this over and over and over again.
(4:56) The outcomes for those children way
(4:58) better. They did better academically.
(5:00) They did better physically. They did
(5:02) better in almost every aspect of life in
(5:05) comparison to modern uh children who are
(5:09) raised in single mother households.
(5:11) There's no there's just no if ends or
(5:12) buts about it. All data points to this.
(5:15) All of it.
(5:17) Okay. So, you were saying that those
(5:19) kids back in the days were better
(5:21) physically. Okay. Yeah, I agree with you
(5:22) because there was no internet. There was
(5:24) no social media. Kids went outside. They
(5:26) played. They socialized. It was a
(5:28) different time, right? That that's what
(5:30) you keep keep bringing it. No, you want
(5:33) it was a different time. There was not
(5:34) as many people in the world. It wasn't
(5:37) so multicultural, right? Was it? It was
(5:40) a different world where these are great
(5:41) arguments against feminism going to be
(5:43) different. Hang on. The outcomes are
(5:44) going to be different, right? Nobody was
(5:46) glued to their TV all day long. So
(5:49) obviously they were better physically
(5:51) fit, right? They went and played more
(5:53) sports. So you could see better
(5:55) sportsmen coming out of there. Nowadays,
(5:56) you're seeing more gamers. It's just
(5:58) different. You're still seeing that
(6:00) talent, but it's different. It's you you
(6:03) don't No, no, no. Because there wasn't
(6:05) that many people at that time either.
(6:07) Like I I just don't understand how you
(6:09) keep comparing that time to now time
(6:11) because the situations were different.
(6:14) You know, the everything wasn't. These
(6:16) are great arguments against
(6:16) multiculturalism. They're so expensive.
(6:19) You know, both parents didn't have to go
(6:21) work outside, right? You could live in a
(6:24) home and one car in a decent. The times
(6:27) have changed now. It you cannot just
(6:30) say, "Oh, it's because single mom
(6:32) again. The single moms, where are the
(6:35) fathers? Why are they in the This is
(6:36) This is fantastic. You're right. It's
(6:39) almost like putting women in the work
(6:40) force, right? Because rich
(6:42) industrialists wanted them to be in the
(6:44) workforce and they did. And it was all
(6:45) funded by Rockefeller, for instance, who
(6:48) wanted them in the workforce in the
(6:50) worst way. Okay. doubled the the now
(6:53) amount of labor, industrial labor which
(6:56) was available, thus decreasing and
(6:58) suppressing wages necessarily. It was a
(7:00) terrible idea. You're right. They could
(7:02) afford one income because society was
(7:04) set up for that. Women demanded the
(7:06) opposite. And the outcome of that was
(7:08) really bad. Not only that, but let's
(7:10) take a look at your other arguments
(7:11) here, which are absurd arguments. If you
(7:14) would have a good leg to stand on if you
(7:16) said, "Well, wait a second. It's a
(7:17) different time then, and they didn't
(7:18) have A, B, C, and D." Uh well, okay, but
(7:21) now we see in two parent households
(7:22) right this second in modernity, the
(7:24) outcomes for children are still way
(7:25) better. Even if they're in houses where
(7:27) the mom and daddy don't really like each
(7:29) other that much, the outcomes for the
(7:30) kids are still better. Why? Because they
(7:32) govern that stuff. They govern the
(7:33) smartphone use. They make them have more
(7:35) playtime. They make demands that they
(7:37) watch less TV. Single mothers aren't
(7:39) making those types of demands. They
(7:40) don't have time to make those types of
(7:41) demands. Clearly, it's better to have a
(7:44) two parent household and keep those
(7:46) intact. feminism has been doing
(7:48) everything it can to destroy that and
(7:51) women's liberation and I I demonstrated
(7:53) it to you and you demonstrated it
(7:55) yourself by saying by giving the
(7:57) examples around society fair here Malich
(8:01) go ahead I think uh I think women uh
(8:05) need to have the right to have a divorce
(8:07) if they are not happy in a marriage they
(8:09) should have a right to divorce uh the
(8:11) fact that you keep saying it and keep
(8:12) bringing it up I I would agree with you
(8:14) yes I agree with you that a child needs
(8:16) both parents and uh again you keep
(8:19) saying single mothers single mothers
(8:21) single mothers I can list 100 names
(8:23) right now of single mothers who's men
(8:26) are not involved they don't want to see
(8:28) the kids so you keep blaming the women
(8:31) where we are the ones trying first of
(8:33) all we didn't go and get an abortion
(8:35) because otherwise then we would be baby
(8:37) killers so now we chose to keep the kids
(8:39) right so that's also our responsibility
(8:41) now we're single mothers and nobody
(8:43) wants us anymore and the men go and cry
(8:45) on the internet Oh, we are restricting
(8:48) access to their kids. No, these men
(8:50) choose. I have even seen men that will
(8:52) quit working so they don't have to pay
(8:54) child support. Yes, maybe single mothers
(8:58) do fall behind, but they have a lot on
(9:00) their plate. But I will tell you
(9:01) something else. I know you're bringing
(9:02) these stats and stuff, but what I see
(9:04) around me is totally different. I have
(9:07) seen single mothers once they get out of
(9:09) the relationship, they're better.
(9:10) They're focusing on themselves. They can
(9:12) focus better on their kids now. Their
(9:14) life is more organized. They're doing
(9:16) far more when they were together in an
(9:18) unhappy relationship. Thank you. Yeah,
(9:20) this is hilarious because we can look at
(9:23) multiple studies which have meta
(9:24) analysis done on them, right? And so we
(9:28) can prove that the court system has been
(9:29) extraordinarily biased against men
(9:31) towards women when it comes to custody
(9:33) here in the United States. We have all
(9:34) the support in the world to prove it. We
(9:36) also know that women are initiating the
(9:38) divorces, not men, due to the
(9:39) unhappiness level, right? They're the
(9:42) initiators of these divorces, not the
(9:44) men. So yeah, the men are like, "Oh,
(9:46) okay. So you're going to take my kid,
(9:47) hit me out of the blue with a divorce,
(9:49) right? And I'm supposed to pay child
(9:50) support? Like screw that. It's a raw
(9:52) deal." So yeah, men have legitimate
(9:55) concerns and gripes with this, right?
(9:58) When they get lamb blasted with things
(10:00) like this. Men are put in that position.
(10:02) The court systems have been
(10:03) traditionally biased against them. At
(10:04) least my entire adult life they have.
(10:06) And in my father's adult life, they
(10:08) were. The second we went into no fault
(10:10) and the custody agreements were
(10:12) automatically defaulting to women. We
(10:14) can see this time and time again. Only
(10:15) through men's rights advocacy has this
(10:17) gotten better at all. And right now,
(10:19) what we can do is we can look at the
(10:20) data of single mother versus single
(10:22) father households and the single father
(10:23) households outperformed them by every
(10:25) single metric. Do you know why that is?
(10:27) It's because abuse in the home happens
(10:29) to children mostly because of
(10:31) stepparents where women are bringing
(10:34) strange men around the kids and that's
(10:36) when the kids get didd and they get beat
(10:38) up and they get everything else. That's
(10:40) on women. That's on the women. You
(10:42) understand? um um this whole argument
(10:44) that oh it's because the single mothers
(10:46) are bringing men because otherwise kids
(10:48) were never getting molested in the
(10:49) houses. Let's not even talk about the
(10:51) church in Pakistan. Most of the kids
(10:53) let's talk about it in in hang on in uh
(10:56) double family homes. You know who who is
(10:58) getting molested in Pakistan? They're
(11:00) wearing borcas or covering everything.
(11:01) The kids are getting molested at their
(11:03) house in their house. Okay. They the
(11:05) some other steparent didn't have to come
(11:07) in. Yeah, I know it happens and women
(11:09) should be careful. But the way you paint
(11:11) here that every single mother is here
(11:13) going on. I've had one guy beat my
(11:15) daughter because I know what it takes to
(11:17) be in that situation, right? Ever. And
(11:20) that's the worst thing that can happen
(11:21) to your have like a your ch. Did you say
(11:24) you had a guy beat your daughter? No. I
(11:27) said I've only have had one man meet my
(11:30) daughter
(11:32) paint all single mothers that are
(11:34) bringing their, you know, stepparents
(11:36) in. And again, how is that woman's
(11:39) fault? Because she's trusting that man.
(11:41) And of course, you men are like this.
(11:43) You will like be I can't even believe
(11:46) it. Like you will come into a
(11:47) relationship with a woman and then try
(11:49) to go and do that to their kid because
(11:51) men are so evil, right? But again, I'm
(11:53) going to go back to your point saying
(11:55) that if it is in a double household and
(11:58) so I agree to you a certain extent, but
(12:00) at the same time, I don't agree with uh
(12:03) sorry, I don't even know what point I
(12:04) was making. I just totally lost it up
(12:06) there. Sorry. Well, let me respond very
(12:08) quickly to all these. Can you repeat
(12:10) that? Yeah. To all the Hang on. Let me
(12:11) respond quickly to all these claims.
(12:12) We'll start with with molestation in
(12:14) church. You're right. It does happen.
(12:15) But you know where you know where it
(12:16) significantly happens way more? Public
(12:18) schools, which is where you're sending
(12:19) your kids. Way more. The It's 100 times
(12:22) more. In fact, 100 times more in public
(12:24) schools. The public institutions are way
(12:26) worse than the churches. So, the thing
(12:27) is is like that point is moot. You're
(12:29) not advocating we get rid of public
(12:30) schools because of that. So, not only
(12:32) that, but let's hang on. But not only
(12:34) that, let's push in even even further
(12:36) when it comes to to stepparents. Am I
(12:38) saying all stepparents are bad? No, I'm
(12:39) a step parent myself. Okay? Am I saying
(12:42) that that's bad? No, I'm not saying it's
(12:43) evil. What I'm saying is that if you
(12:45) really have concern for your children,
(12:47) you'll do everything you can first to
(12:49) make your relationship work out on
(12:51) behalf of your child, knowing that the
(12:53) stats and rates of bringing strange
(12:55) people around are going to be
(12:56) detrimental to your child. That's
(12:58) terrible. And this happens over and over
(13:00) again. Women are choosing to be single
(13:02) moms. The the father does not want to
(13:04) break it up. The father does not want to
(13:06) break the family up. They choose to be
(13:09) single moms by initiating these divorce
(13:11) procedures against the husband's will
(13:13) and they don't have to show any cause.
(13:15) They're choosing it. You can't choose
(13:16) it. They complain about it. Yeah. No, we
(13:19) are choosing it. I have actually spoken
(13:21) to three women that just got separated
(13:23) here. One was never married, but they
(13:24) broke up. They were together for like
(13:26) seven years. Yeah. Women are choosing
(13:27) because we're tired. Like women have
(13:29) literally told me they're like, "We're
(13:30) tired. We can't do all this work." uh
(13:33) you know like you guys are not putting
(13:35) your own weight. No, you guys are not
(13:36) pulling your own weight that you're
(13:38) saying we are choosing instead of being
(13:40) miserable. We want to leave and men
(13:41) don't want to leave. Men don't want to
(13:43) leave. Who wants to leave when all your
(13:45) [ __ ] is done for you? Who wants to leave
(13:47) and you have a maid who taking care of
(13:49) your kids? She's cooking. She's
(13:50) cleaning. She's sleeping with you. And
(13:53) you don't even have to pay anything.
(13:55) Wow. What a privilege she's sleeping
(13:56) with you. Wow. What a privilege. Set off
(13:58) the bills, too. Wow. It's like heaven.
(14:00) Haven't you seen that stats? The single
(14:02) women are happier and married men are
(14:05) happy because all their chores are done
(14:07) for them because they've got a maid.
(14:09) This is exactly what it that's why women
(14:10) are like we've had enough. We'll do it
(14:12) ourselves ourselves. If we have to do
(14:14) the same work, we'll do it work. And let
(14:16) me tell you, one person work less is so
(14:20) much better. Believe me, we can focus
(14:22) more. So you this is why women are
(14:24) leaving it there. It is their choice.
(14:26) I'm not arguing with you. But you men,
(14:29) you don't want to leave because you're
(14:30) so comfortable. You don't want to do
(14:33) better. So women just get up and leave.
(14:34) They're like, "Okay, [ __ ] it." Oh, I
(14:36) see. Yeah. So, here's what's actually
(14:37) going on. You're talking out of both
(14:38) sides of your mouth again. So, on the
(14:40) one hand, you say, "It's so hard for
(14:41) single moms out here." Oh my god. You're
(14:43) talking my turn for 60 seconds. So, you
(14:47) speak out of both sides of your mouth.
(14:48) Okay. It's so hard to be a single mom.
(14:51) Who would ever choose that condition?
(14:52) It's so terrible. Then on the other
(14:53) hand, you're like, I know women who are
(14:54) choosing that condition right now
(14:55) because they're just tired of men.
(14:57) You're speaking out of both sides of
(14:58) your mouth. Right? So here's here's
(15:00) what's actually happening. Men feel an
(15:02) obligation duty to keep their families
(15:04) intact. Women do not in modernity feel
(15:06) an obligation to keep their family
(15:08) intact. That's why they initiate these
(15:10) divorces. Not only are they initiating
(15:11) these divorces, but you by your own
(15:13) admission just said, you know, no less
(15:14) than three right now who just did
(15:15) because they're just tired. You know,
(15:17) they just don't feel fulfilled. What
(15:18) about the duty to the kid? I don't know.
(15:20) Screw the kid. It's all about me. It's
(15:22) all about mom. It's all about how I
(15:24) feel. It's like, no, you have children
(15:26) involved now. You have a duty and
(15:28) obligation to keep your family together
(15:29) just like the men do who are not
(15:31) initiating these divorces. You say it's
(15:33) because they're so comfortable. No,
(15:34) they're not. They're working more than
(15:35) ever. They're working more overtime than
(15:37) ever. They're working their asses off
(15:38) non-stop. And by the way, the
(15:40) conditional, if you think that single
(15:42) women are so much happier, explain why
(15:43) they kill themselves more often than
(15:45) married women do if they're so [ __ ]
(15:47) happy. Especially divorced women.
(15:49) especially divorced women try to off
(15:51) themselves more. In fact, this is one of
(15:53) the segments of demographics most likely
(15:55) to do it. We'll kick it over to Malish.
(15:59) It's like we can say why are men that
(16:01) get divorced also commit suicide? Single
(16:03) men are also committing suicide. It's
(16:05) miserable. They're both they're both
(16:06) doing it, right? Uh it's miserable.
(16:10) When I try to answer you, you just
(16:12) distract me with these. All right.
(16:13) Right. I'm not going to distract you. Go
(16:15) ahead. And uh so yeah, no, women are
(16:17) tired and men are comfortable. They are
(16:19) comfortable. That's that's that's
(16:21) exactly the reality of it. Men are
(16:23) working. So are women. Today women are
(16:25) working. It's two income household. But
(16:27) when men come home, they want their
(16:28) meals cooked. They don't want to do
(16:30) anything at home. So exactly this is how
(16:32) bad it is. Even though women know life
(16:35) is going to be miserable, probably
(16:37) really hard after they leave that guy,
(16:40) but they still choose it because they're
(16:42) still happier than what they were in
(16:44) before. So imagine how bad it is.
(16:47) Imagine how bad it is. You guys don't
(16:49) see your shortcoming. You guys keep
(16:51) blaming things on us. Women work 60 plus
(16:54) hours extra in just household labor,
(16:58) running around with the kids and their
(16:59) chores and doing all those things. And
(17:01) I'm not only talking about single moms.
(17:03) I'm talking about mothers that have
(17:04) parents. And if men wanted to keep
(17:08) families together, we wouldn't have men
(17:10) cheating with multiple women. All right?
(17:13) No. Those men will go out. Men do commit
(17:15) more adultery. You know that men are
(17:18) more likely to go cheat because they
(17:20) can't control themselves. Of course,
(17:22) it's our religion. In Islam, you're
(17:24) legally allowed for wives. Like
(17:26) seriously. Yeah. I'm not advocating on
(17:27) behalf of Islam. That's one. And I
(17:30) advocate on behalf of monogamy like
(17:32) Christians do. Not only that, but who
(17:34) are they cheating with? They're cheating
(17:35) with women who are home wreckers.
(17:36) They're like, "What do you want me to
(17:38) say there?" Not only that, but men work
(17:41) more hours than we're married. You know
(17:43) how many guys come to me? Don't tell me
(17:45) they're Yeah. Stop. Stop clucking, lady.
(17:48) So, men work more hours than women. This
(17:50) is a statistical fact. You can look it
(17:52) up yourself. You can Google it right
(17:53) this second. Men work way more hours
(17:55) than women do. Not only that, when you
(17:57) say, "Oh, but women in household chores
(17:59) actually do more." No, they don't. And
(18:01) again, it gets way easier. Most women
(18:04) pack their kids off to a public
(18:06) institution for eight hours out of the
(18:08) day. Who are you trying to fool here?
(18:12) How dumb do you think we are? You pack
(18:14) them up for eight, nine, 10 hours a day.
(18:16) After school activities often will take
(18:18) up even more of their time. You have to
(18:19) help them with a little bit of homework.
(18:21) Make sure they brush their teeth and go
(18:22) to bed. It's a real rough life out
(18:24) there. Meanwhile, you have modern
(18:26) conveniences, washing machines,
(18:27) dishwashers. How long do you think it it
(18:29) takes to load a dishwasher? Not very
(18:31) long. How long do you think it takes to
(18:33) load the laundry? Not very long. No.
(18:36) Household chores are not You're not
(18:38) overcoming men in their overtime work
(18:41) with household chores. That's
(18:43) ridiculous. And not only that, it's not
(18:45) laborious. As a famous comedian once
(18:47) said, "Any job you can do in your
(18:49) [ __ ] pajamas can't be that hard.
