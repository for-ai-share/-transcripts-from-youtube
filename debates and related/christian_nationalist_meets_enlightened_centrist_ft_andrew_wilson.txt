(0:00) on the woke cry are you Are you on the woke right james Lindsay bandwagon james Lindsay has quote tweeted me and said
(0:05) "I'm on the woke right." You're on the woke right according to James Lindseay who I guess he's the arbiter of it i
(0:11) thought you were a radical centrist well I thought you were not anti-Semitic and then I heard that you do not blindly
(0:18) support Israel or excuse me blindly support the United States sucking Israel's all the time yeah that's
(0:23) correct which must mean you you hate Jews that's what I'm told
(0:28) yeah um I'm told that if I don't blindly support
(0:33) uh any nation other than you know mine the one that I live in and any of my
(0:38) countrymen you know like you uh that that means that I'm a hateful spiteful Jew hating uh you know etc etc so right
(0:46) which is funny i retweeted your uh you tweeted you said "The reason it's impossible for me to denounce quote Jews
(0:52) is because in my religion no ethnic group is evil nor has evil ontology in fact evil has no ontology." My
(0:58) criticisms for Zionism revolve around a narrow political ideology not Jewsburg same with Arab Muslim distinction it's
(1:06) almost like that's an eminently reasonable position to have yeah it's an America first position so I don't
(1:12) believe that uh and Christians don't believe that people are born evil there are Christians who believe in the idea
(1:18) of original sin right sure but evil is an absence of the presence of God it
(1:24) doesn't have ontology itself god has ontology so the things that you that you call
(1:30) evil as an atheist and that I call evil we might agree on but for very different reasons don't call me the a word yeah or
(1:37) I'm sorry a secularist no no no no no i'm Christian adjacent we've discussed this secular secular i'm the true
(1:42) Christian no no no well when we when we'll get into we'll see if you've evolved away from your nonsense
(1:49) presuppositionalism and moved into the absolute based philosophical pragmatism which is the best justification for
(1:55) Christianity um but uh yeah cuz I talk about Zog
(2:00) quite often i'm very concerned with Israel um dragging us into wars and also massacring Palestinians i find that yeah
(2:07) see but that's the problem right it's like that's not really the America first position i don't care about them either
(2:12) yeah I know that yeah which is um unfortunate I suppose but many different angles here's fine it's like we've got
(2:19) our own problems the best thing that I can do is affect my people group in my nation who are my people group so that
(2:26) they get the best for themselves that's I mean it's a it's a war it's a war of tribes man and I'm an American and an an
(2:33) American firster i care about guys like you doing as good as possible i'm not
(2:38) going to entangle myself in the foreign affairs of others yeah that's eminently reasonable so then
(2:44) what is up with all of the uh the juice burgers you call them do you think that they How serious of a threat to the
(2:51) dissident right do you think the people who obsess about Jews are because I love making jokes and jokes about Yeah
(2:59) because it's funny right exactly because I don't have any Look
(3:04) there's a lot of There's a lot of people Well okay let me let me try to frame this right without sounding like an
(3:10) arrogant dick so I'm I'm going to try to do this right when has that ever held you back before yeah yeah so so with a
(3:16) bit of humility I'm a weapon and there's a lot of people who think their hands
(3:21) would wield me best and so because that's the case many people vy their
(3:26) ideologies so that I'll go in on their behalf and bring a massive audience with me in order to support their ideology
(3:33) even though I've always been very very crystal clear that the Crucible is going to do its own thing we've rejected many
(3:39) contracts from many large organizations we're not going to work with them [ __ ] them we're always going to stay
(3:45) independent and do our own thing unless unless it was the case that some organization came along who literally
(3:51) had the exact same interests you know what I mean um and would give us the
(3:56) viable push into the mainstream because they just agreed with everything we had to say uh we might you know we might
(4:02) compromise there but the truth of the matter is is that as an independent operator I can tell all of them to go
(4:09) [ __ ] themselves and get behind enemy lines in a way a lot of these [ __ ] people can't and uh and just completely
(4:16) wreak destruction on all these [ __ ] sides of these lunatics who are all over the internet and all over the space so
(4:22) what an enlightened centrist position to have wreak havoc on all sides because we are surrounded by [ __ ] degenerates
(4:28) there's leftwing degenerates and there's rightwing degenerates wreak havoc on the enlightened centrists as well no well
(4:34) we're we are um we are a highly uh adaptable flexible bunch and so we can
() 
(4:40) we can take your your criticisms you're far more you're far more right-wing than you like to let on by the way far more
(4:48) right-wing you always have been by the way i I've never believed your centrist [ __ ] trope of [ __ ] i've never
(4:54) believed it for a second i think at night when you listen to all the [ __ ] crazies you agree the most with guys
(5:01) like me you're like you know I think these Christnats got you know they Yeah in
(5:06) fact I watched a video you did where you're like basically the Christian nationalists are going to get it all and you're right we are we are yeah the Yeah
(5:12) yeah i just posted one the three political vibe shifts that will be changing yes the Christian nationalists are in the ascent no doubt and that's a
(5:18) direct result because of all the degeneracy and nonsense that came a lot of it from the left but it also comes
(5:24) from the right No no no no no yeah you're the biggest enablers you're the
(5:29) enablers wrong you're the ultimate the ultimate enemy of the enlightened centrist besides the regular moderate
(5:36) centrist is degenerate degeneracy itself there's nothing that that is centrist
(5:42) going to do about degeneracy nothing they're just going to do your thing man it's going to articulate it's going to
(5:47) articulate smoke some weed just do your own thing bro come on i'm sober now i'm sober now i don't smoke weed anymore no
(5:54) alcohol no weed no porn no nicotine no no alcohol none top chicos only top chico squad well it used to be a lot
(6:00) funner when you had a drink that's true um as my as my reach and influence
(6:05) expands Andrew I I need to be a bit more careful um some of the things that once perhaps were uttered on a you know 50
(6:12) person live stream with Yumi and Zen Shapiro your sidekick Unic uh is no
(6:17) longer uh is no longer fit for for large audiences but well after breaking both
(6:22) of his hands bludgeoning your face multiple times he's he's had a lengthy recovery bro he's had a very lengthy
(6:29) recovery from just breaking every bone in his face this is why I know you're more
(6:34) leftwing than you really are cuz I've always admired you you you you have you have a soft spot for the weak and Zen
(6:40) Shapiro is the weak that you bring wait why do you think I'm here bro it's a soft spot that's fair yeah yeah that's
(6:45) fair it's a very paternal role um no you see the uh what your problem is well I
(6:53) don't know we'll figure it out we'll figure it out in this conversation um I don't think I don't know to the degree
(6:59) to which you have the mechanisms built into your ideology to resist going too
(7:04) far right you told I think it was Steven Crowder that you are far right and
(7:10) moderate dissident right yeah so moderate that's sounds very centrist of
(7:16) you Andrew why are you not far dissident right because ideologies are balanced on pillars and so and enlightened centrism
(7:23) is the central pillar in which all ideologies balance no that's not the case the idea of philosophical the the
(7:30) philosophical view that you take of enlightened centism is just its own encased ideology with its own pillars so
(7:37) each ideology is contained in and of itself though there's overlap between them each one is its own house on its
(7:43) own pillars you you just saying that it's centrism and so therefore it's in the middle of all other houses is just a
(7:50) giant [ __ ] coke bro well it's just a giant I know and when you say I'm right-wing I know what that means to you
(7:56) is rightwing equals good so you just mean you Paul you embody good characteristics every now and then which
(8:01) I believe I believe you believe that i do I do legitimately believe that the left are the bad guys yes the the very
() 
(8:08) very worst of the bad guys and that there's no such thing as a good Democrat they're all [ __ ] worthless scum um
(8:15) and that the only thing that's worthless Hold on they're all Are they all equally Are they all equally worthless scum i
(8:21) mean they start at they start at worthless scum and just go more worthless from there but all Democrats
(8:26) are useless useless [ __ ] worthless scumbags who And by the way most like
(8:32) Republicans i was going to say what is this most Republicans do the centrist position they both
(8:38) default no no no no no one sucks way worse and the default for all Democrats are you start sucking right away just
(8:45) being by if you say to me "Yeah by the way I support the Democrat." I just I instantly know you're a [ __ ] piece of
(8:51) [ __ ] just instantly you're talking about progressives there's plenty of working class Democrat like people all [ __ ]
(8:58) worthless if you support Democrats you're a [ __ ] idiot and you're worthless they are the most worthless
(9:03) thieving conniving pieces of [ __ ] [ __ ] who have ever existed when you say that I want you to know that when you
(9:10) say that I I get it i perceive it exactly the same as when Destiny says the same [ __ ] about conservatives it is
(9:17) just a man possessed by ideology unable to travel down the more nuanced path to
(9:23) excise either side of its freaks which there are absolutely freaks on the far right i'm way more nuanced in my views I
(9:29) think than the Kumer Gremlin and I got to tell you right maybe it depends on all of the all of the the formal axioms
(9:37) of the Democratic Party are [ __ ] evil like name a single Democrat party axiom
(9:42) that's not evil wealth inequality is a real problem wealth inequality is a real problem
(9:48) which you're the wealthiest [ __ ] people who have ever existed on planet Earth dude like literally we're having a
(9:55) conversation Americans we're having a conversation from across the [ __ ] nation to each other right now for cents
(10:02) for pennies pennies yeah well that's cuz you and I are are white Andrew and you know obviously first of all the dominant
(10:08) the dominant race apparently most of that wealth [ __ ] inequality they're always bitching about comes from the
(10:14) very same [ __ ] NOS's which then back up Hillary Clinton and the rest of these [ __ ] in order to do insider trading
(10:20) are all [ __ ] [ __ ] snakes andrew I live by a very important principle which is I do not um bring
(10:26) people on to this channel to agree with them because you and I will agree all day that Hillary Clinton and the Podesta
(10:32) folks are exactly the kind of people who people watching this suspect they are
(10:38) um do you think that there's no good Democrats can you agree with that there's not a sing All axioms of the
(10:43) Democrat party are bad every one of them no I think all individuals contain both good and evil within them okay okay
(10:48) individuals sure but we're not talking about that we're talking about ideology is there an a single axiom for the
(10:54) Democrat party that you actually agree just one just give me [ __ ] one yeah wealth inequality is a real problem okay
(11:01) what's the problem with wealth inequality like I'm for universal healthcare what do you think about that why because
(11:07) I think the hyper libertarian mindset well because I'm sorry I'm an America first nationalist
(11:13) citizens come before other people of the country look at what But we know we have the examples now of the universalization
(11:19) of healthcare and it's [ __ ] disaster look at Canada it's a [ __ ] disaster the N Okay the the NHS in England is
(11:26) like very highly rated by [ __ ] trash by the way they're rating themselves
(11:31) what do you think they're gonna do give themselves a bad [ __ ] rating the you the people the the the the the citizens
(11:36) in the UK rank it as one of their Yeah that must be why they come over here for private healthcare all the [ __ ] time huh yeah true there's there's there's um
(11:43) it's cost benefit i'm also not sold on universal healthcare i'm just I'm sympathetic to it but okay hold on this is all not this all this is all Listen
(11:48) this is all neither here nor there of the deeper philosophical issue don't destiny me right now this is okay i'll
(11:54) even grant you one i'll even grant you one can you give me a single other axiom you agree with let me just grant that
(12:00) one of the Democratic Party yeah no no no no nothing so is this wealth inequality
(12:08) that's the [ __ ] axiom so if Republicans are like "We're going to do something about this wealth inequality," then you would have to be a Republican
(12:14) necessarily because I don't want to give you one no I want to move on a different topic yeah you want to move on all right all right see the
(12:22) You know what I think i think the uh I'll I'll take the bait and stay here for a moment you when you play the
(12:28) Democrats are evil card some of them are sure the axioms of their ideology fine sure
(12:34) all right well we'll get to that when I destroy your metaphysical worldview once again I'm I'm much more prepared this time okay um but uh when you do that you
(12:42) basically enable people to then support Republicans blindly who are in my opinion just as much neocons who want to
(12:48) get us into foreign wars and um spend money on the military-industrial complex conservatives are not the party anymore
(12:55) they It's still true that they have big charges but the that is not the case the
(13:01) the Republican party is being taken over by guys like [ __ ] me listen I've been saying it for the last
(13:07) 3 years okay the Christian nationalists are on the ascent but you know what that's why I've come here Andrew because
(13:13) as much as I like you um until you bend the knee to enlightened centism I don't think you're in a position to uh I don't
(13:20) want you spearheading the right vanguard of the uh the first How was your How
(13:25) how's it going with that uh master enlightened centrist Jordan Peterson and all of his [ __ ] gargling for [ __ ]
(13:31) Israel how do you like that how do you like when he sticks that big Israeli dick right down his throat your hero is
(13:38) that your favorite bro your You know what your best quality is your best quality is saying things I 100% agree
(13:43) with as if I don't believe them myself not all night nothing to argue with nothing down your throat bro nothing to
(13:50) argue with and didn't I tell you two years ago that Jordan Peterson well you would end up rejecting his ideology the
(13:55) more that you uh were exposed to it and you're like I don't think so jordan Peterson is the man everybody should be listening to him blah blah blah blah
(14:02) blah and now you're trying to take all eight inches out of that [ __ ] mouth PF you're trying
(14:08) to just saying um I disagree with your characterization
(14:15) i've I've I think more than two years ago I was saying that Jordan Peterson has absolutely fallen and well let's get
(14:21) into it now why don't we actually hold there's a few other things before because once the gloves come off they're not they're not going back on oh they're
(14:27) not um you're going to talk to Jonathan Pou anytime soon i don't know he's an
(14:34) Eastern orth he's an Eastern Orthodox guy okay all right we'll leave it at that i I'm
(14:40) not that familiar with his work all right all right i won't dig anything
(14:47) um okay let's you can dig i'll just be honest with you you know it's not it
(14:52) doesn't hurt my feelings if you dig into like what I what my plans are what I what I want to do like that doesn't
(14:58) bother me okay well can I ask you what I asked you over DMs go ahead um I believe
() 
(15:04) you had correct me if I'm wrong i believe you had said something to the effect a few years ago or maybe within the last year or so that one of the
(15:10) things you were considering was um leveraging your audience or your platform to do actual political activism
(15:17) particularly in something like divorce court reform which I think you I and even a lot of feminists even if they're
(15:23) not completely brainwashed would agree that the divorce courts are deeply systemically biased against men mhm and
(15:31) uh I was like that's [ __ ] base as [ __ ] that's very enlighten you um what are your plans with that do you will
(15:37) that ever happen would you support that or if I were to involve myself in political action I wouldn't want to be a
(15:44) politician because they don't have very much power i on the other hand would
(15:50) much prefer to have an NGO setting behind the scenes supporting frontmen
(15:55) who did everything possible to lay the groundwork for the destruction of all feminist activity on planet earth which
(16:04) includes divorce court meddling yes as the dark lord okay it is important the
(16:09) cloud that's my type it's important that if we have a Palpatine that he does Palpatine like stuff um do you I don't
(16:17) respect your Star Wars analogies because you wear a Kylo Ren hoodie and those movies are objectively the worst movies of all time okay but Kylo Ren killed Han
(16:25) Solo Ray you got anything doesn't matter doesn't Yeah it's He's part of the worst series of all time he's part of a Disney
(16:31) remake of the series which are gar I I I agree that everything about
(16:37) those movies was [ __ ] except that he killed the most insufferable character history which is Han Solo not you could
(16:43) have had a Revan hoodie and you chose a Kylo Ren hoodie okay listen i mean come on the
(16:50) look from Look when I'm on when I'm on Piers Morgan I'm asked to publicly condemn Andrew Wilson i say I will
(16:56) publicly condemn Andrew Wilson he wore a Kylo Ren hoodie when he could have wore a Revan hoodie which how utterly how
(17:01) utterly archetypically um weak he is in his ability to evaluate art properly
(17:06) okay disgusting kylo Ren the character the reason I respect him is because he
(17:11) killed the most insufferable Star Wars character ever which is Han Solo yes insufferable the most insufferable most
(17:17) insufferable okay the All right compared to Jar Jar Banks what's Well you know like at the time they were doing the rogue archetype with everything you know
(17:24) what I mean the handsome rogue who's a I'm actually secretly the good guy baby but I'm actually a [ __ ] horrible
(17:31) criminal too you know they were doing that whole archetype forever and it was like the guy was in [ __ ] insufferable
(17:38) where was all the Well you know what it is shadow rejection well where was the stuff where do we get to see Han Solo
(17:44) doing the criminal activity and horrible [ __ ] things well nowhere nowhere he's
(17:49) a good guy and he is a good guy and the whole time they're calling him a bad guy and I'm like what the [ __ ] um it sounds
(17:55) like shadow projection because you know because you know that deep down the inside you're you're trying to be the
(18:00) good guy that's secretly the bad guy and oh I'm the rogue and you're out here being all misogynistic and all that guy
(18:06) i've always believed Palpatine was the good guy in Star Wars um well to be honest they never really articulated
(18:12) exactly why the Empire was evil in the initial movies um or in the uh or in the
(18:17) subsequent movies which in the prequels obviously showed that Palpatine was the good guy who was trying to take this
(18:23) [ __ ] crazy cult of enlightened centrists who enlightened the rebels are far too cringe for that no no not that
(18:29) of rebels the Jedi the Jedi no the Jedi are not enlightened you know who is enlightened centrist craya from Cotor no
(18:37) yeah oh that's the definition gray Jedi no Dark Side she wasn't a gray Jedi she was dark side well she ended up as Darth
(18:44) Treya but Craya she was always Darth Treya okay yes but she Well fine that's all right an enlightened centrist
(18:50) pretends to be in the middle but is ultimately rightwing right yeah but hold on you agree that Craya is one of the
(18:56) best characters you agree that Cray is one of the best characters in Star Wars you don't think so no god man i
(19:02) increasingly I respect your artistic and aesthetic opinions less and less didn't you say don't you have first of all she
(19:07) was a woman did she really pose what threat did she really oh my god listen you're yeah and by the way in the second
(19:13) I can't even say with a straight face it works on Morgan's audience it doesn't work on me second in the second movie
(19:18) okay or I mean the second video game the main protagonist was actually a woman correct her name was [ __ ]
(19:25) [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] you got to go from Darth Revan to and you know what everybody made him a man
(19:34) every Of course of course people select you can select whether Revan was a female or not it's like what i played
(19:40) Coach War 2 first so I didn't understand that cuz I didn't understand from course yeah see what I mean and did
(19:47) you really think you have any trouble by the time you hit level 25 of taking out Darth Treya you two hit it or didn't you
(19:53) you did every side quest and you two-hitted this [ __ ] didn't you craya yeah no no craya was hard to kill cray
(20:00) with the floating lightsabers that was nothing it was a joke all right now you're miming now you're all right listen listen listen listen
(20:07) listen um what how did I even This is what This is This is the reason that you and
(20:13) Destiny are so successful against me is because I'll just go along with whatever you're saying i'll just get baited into
(20:19) it because it's fun but hold on okay uh the wife Jack meme oh by the way
(20:28) my favorite debate of all time is you versus Bosch really yeah debates ever
(20:35) that you moderated or that I thought you did really well at coming across as completely non-threatening as
(20:42) you completely destroyed his idea he changed his mind live it's one of the first times I've ever seen him change his life he's like "Yo I guess you're
(20:48) kind of right that I really shouldn't actually uh you know commit that this guy's an evil genocidal maniacal maniac
(20:55) like I was with my rhetoric but I do have a degree in sociology." And you were like "Exactly Vosch." So it's one
(21:01) of my favorites um you did you did a good job with that one i did well yeah precisely because I um I did the
(21:07) opposite of what you did which is you come out and you go "All right I'm gonna debate someone i'm going to put them in
(21:12) my sights and then I will bash their head in rhetorically." Whereas I I go "Let me speak to the real person right
(21:19) let me use all the wit and charm that I can muster." Which by the way I I'm I'm using all the wit and charm I can muster right now Andrew to keep you in debate
(21:26) mode because as soon as debate mode happens I'll still crush you he watched He watched Goblin porn by the way
(21:31) goblin porn short stack goblins goblin porn bro no no short stack yeah short stack short stack goblins that's what he
(21:38) thought right there's short stack and I dream of horses who bang me and as a horse your impression is not as good as
(21:46) I think you think it is no it's not great i know i know i I I hear the attempt um what's your best degree in
(21:53) sociology what's What's your What's your best impression can you do any good impressions uh yeah i have some good
(21:59) impressions they're not for you though okay not for you they're too good for you i'll buy you dinner first all right
(22:05) um okay wife jack meme this is a serious as you know I'm very interested in mimemetics and the flow of ideas and all
(22:11) that um that's an old meme now dude it's an old meme but this is this is I want to my criticism of you is I don't think
(22:17) you are pro I don't think your ideology whatever your moderate dissident right stuff is has the sufficient mechanisms
(22:23) within it to resist going too far right and one example is the wife Jack meme i love the wifejack meme i think it's the
(22:28) it's the the ideal low-level consistent diffuse um rejection of degeneracy by
(22:36) saying "Oh you know we're going to you know just [ __ ] sleep around whatever [ __ ] do anything blah blah all that different shit." It's like no it's like
(22:42) it's it's it's not my old ball and chain it's oh it's the wife oh it's my wife there she is it's classic wife but it's
(22:48) it's fundamentally positive oriented i never even [ __ ] understood what it meant okay let me ask you the question
(22:55) though okay the Gropers and Fuentes came out heavy against the wife jack meme called it gay and [ __ ] and all that
(23:01) stuff i think what's your opinion on it do you think it is well I never really got it what was the point of it the
(23:08) point of it was just it's a pro-social just oh it's the opposite of oh my it's the old ball and chain it's like oh my
(23:14) wife she's quirky and she always asks pauses the movie and asks what's going on it's like yeah but I love my wife so
(23:20) like that's what I like about her it does sound kind of it's a positive it does sound pretty gay bro i'm not going
(23:25) to lie that does sound pretty bad like it's the same old Isn't that the same [ __ ] Simpsons thing where it's like
(23:32) um you know the you're just reversing it now you know what I mean the woman's kind of like oh fish and quirky and you
(23:39) know you just like deal with her quirks because she's [ __ ] you know because she's still pretty awesome and blah it's
(23:44) like no [ __ ] that no [ __ ] that i want behavioral standards which are applied to women where their stupid [ __ ]
(23:51) quirks they don't get to pass on all their stupid [ __ ] quirks dude oh my god i'm just quirky i'm just quirky here
(23:58) we go here we go let's get into meta let's Before we get into metaphysics I'll I'll we'll get to rhetoric okay um
(24:04) we don't even have to get into Why do you want to get into metaphysics so bad because it's because studying a Grippa's trillemma because I've destroyed you
(24:11) once and I would like to do it again oh um okay but hold on on rhetoric
() 
(24:18) um again you were talking to Steven Crowder and you said uh you started
(24:24) saying all this gay [ __ ] you're like well Socrates says rhetoric is whatever convinces people right it's not logic so
(24:31) we agree that logic alone Yeah logic logical argumentation alone is not a sufficient means by which to convince
(24:37) people rhetoric is important no that's not true logic is a sufficient enough means to convince people it's just not a
(24:44) sufficient enough means to convince all people or even the majority of people agreed yes correct yeah that's a I would
(24:50) Yes logic having a logically cohesive argument if a if a weak ass beta male
(24:57) has a perfectly logical cohesive argument he sounds like a [ __ ] tool and he's very weak and he's very insecure it doesn't matter how logical
(25:04) his argument is it's people will perceive that rightfully as pathetic and ignore him mhm that's okay
(25:13) isn't that just tone isn't Isn't this Isn't this what people criticize you for you say it's tone policing but how do
(25:19) you know that criticism of your rhetoric why you're confusing tone policing with criticism of your rhetoric meaning Mhm
(25:27) you obviously go very hard you obviously go very hard a lot of the time this a good point but I'm going to turn it around on you in about 5 seconds okay
(25:35) well yeah okay well so what if they're only ever identifying one form of rhetoric and the
(25:42) one form of rhetoric is things which they happen to find to be personally offensive then is it then is it the case
(25:50) that they actually have problem with the rhetoric or they actually have trouble with the tone in which I'm saying the
(25:56) thing because that's what offends them i don't I don't understand that okay so let's take Okay I'll explain you get my
(26:01) point though right let's take No not really because you always say make an argument logical argument logical
(26:06) argument then it's like but you acknowledge that calling [ __ ] women [ __ ] and [ __ ] turns women off yeah
(26:12) okay but Okay well not always it doesn't though so So the autistic most of the
(26:17) time like it depends on how you say it yeah most of the time i'm going to explain i'm going to explain okay okay
(26:22) so if I say to a woman "Oh my god you're being such an insufferable bitch." Right
(26:28) often times you'll get a giggle or a laugh out of them but if you say you're being a [ __ ] insufferable [ __ ]
(26:35) suddenly ah it's too [ __ ] far so how is it that the rhetoric is the problem
(26:41) they're really not pointing at the rhetoric they're pointing at something the tone they're pointing at the [ __ ]
(26:46) tone sure i'm putting tone under the subcategory of rhetoric but I'm speaking rhetoric more broadly like sure like you
(26:54) sure let me ask you a question if you take a hundred we agree that um the woke
(27:02) left ideology has infested our culture to the degree where it's um I would say it's uh thanks to thanks to Centric yes
(27:10) go ahead i will allow that transgression to pass um but uh a little well
(27:15) poisoning yeah yeah that's fine a little well poisoning i've long I've long been since immune to your your your toxins m
(27:23) um I regard a lot of women as victims of what you might call feminist ideology
(27:30) you see it all the time where it's like a woman's like 35 or 40 and she's crying cuz she can't have kids and it's like I was lied to i was told if I got a career
(27:35) all that stuff and I don't think they're some of them are obviously faking it but I think the majority of women who feel
(27:43) that way genuinely do feel it and they genuinely feel like they were lied to so I regard women as in some sense many of
(27:49) them being victims of this degenerate ideology that says "Yeah go [ __ ] around just as much as men do and go make money
(27:56) and put off having a family and all that stuff." I like that's bad not just for men it's bad for women and so I see them
(28:02) in some sense as as victims of that the average let's say you say take
(28:08) a hund I'm just you take a 100 women who are of that ideology who are not like super you know purple hair out
(28:14) protesting but are like yeah I'm I would consider myself a feminist like kind of what out of a hundred if if I show them
(28:20) a random Andrew Wilson clip from a Piers Morgan interview what percentage of those women do you think would
(28:26) immediately just go [ __ ] you [ __ ] this guy across uh which age brackets let's
(28:31) say 18 to 30 i think that they would respond to that
(28:36) pretty well 18 to 30 yeah if you average if you said 18 to 26 or 24 I think they
(28:45) would respond poorly to it once we get into the 30s 40s 50s I think that they would respond pretty well to it
(28:54) um okay we obviously we don't know i get your point as people as women get older and realize
(29:01) oh [ __ ] I was lied to by this ideology then I think they'd be more sympathetic to lied to themselves my point is they
(29:07) lied to themselves well here's the thing i I reject the categorization that these women are victims so I I'll give you and
(29:14) just to throw this back in your face you have been at the forefront of battling trans ideology for a long time i
(29:21) followed your career very closely uh because we started out in the streaming world kind of at the same time in many
(29:28) ways so of course I'm always looking in on you [ __ ] peasants to see to see
(29:34) how you're doing right and uh I've always thought that your kind of battle
(29:39) against the degenerate trans ideology was good but the thing is is just like you make this point yourself it's self-d
(29:44) delusion and you say this all the time self-d delusion and it's replicating self-d delusion so here's the here this
(29:50) becomes the question the question is when does it become your responsibility
(29:55) to shrug off poisonous ideology when because the thing is is like what I
(30:01) think when you say victimhood is it gives them a pass it gives it gives these women a a cultural pass to say all
(30:07) of the bad behavior that I did was completely justified because I had been lied to do you think is it convenience
(30:14) that now when I hit the age where I really want to settle down with an Omega
(30:20) Chad right listen I'm not like that anymore i was lied to i just have more I
(30:26) just have much more sympathy I guess than you do do you think men are victims of modern a lot of the modern culture
(30:32) yes mostly from women and do you fine do you think that calling men victims then empowers them to justify their own
(30:39) failings that they actually could no no no there's a distinction here men are actual victims because of the single
(30:45) motherhood epidemic we can point to the actual thing that they were the victims of which is women they were the victims
(30:52) of women who decided that they were going to be [ __ ] empowered by embracing single motherhood not because
(30:58) of anything other than uh I had irreconcilable differences with my actually pretty good husband who I just
(31:05) decided to get rid of because I wanted to [ __ ] Chad down the street okay what if what about the men who are not the
(31:11) products of single motherhood most of those men are very stable and most of those men are already on the right
(31:16) they're already fighting it out yes it is true if you look at at conservative ideology a good indicator is an intact
(31:23) family if you have a nuclear intact family the chances that you as a male are going to be on the conservative the
(31:28) right side the good side is already much higher if you come from a single mom though guess what your chances of being
(31:35) some overly [ __ ] empathetic [ __ ] who is easily malleable and
(31:41) manipulated is significantly higher i can literally trace the actual victimhood back to its source which is
(31:48) [ __ ] women now here's here's the interesting thing i'll give you the more proof on this cuz if we trace it back to
(31:54) single fathers guess what the outcomes are damn near just about absent fathers as in single as in even even if you're
(32:01) with a single father who's absent most of the time your outcomes are still almost I okay I was just curious to hear
(32:09) what you would say if I said that um you understand the point I was making of
(32:14) logical argumentation is not enough because often you say make an argument make an argument make an argument you can't respond this guy in my chat is
(32:20) spuring out Andrew is a terrible representation of orthodoxy listen chatter I just want to Make it clear
(32:26) that you can go [ __ ] yourself and tell your priest I told you you can go [ __ ] yourself go tell your pri be like Andrew
(32:31) Wilson out of the internet told me to go [ __ ] myself i'm just you know what cuz he in his
(32:37) head he's going to be like you shouldn't have said that and then you're going to turn around he's going to be like that insufferable [ __ ] that insufferable I
(32:43) know what's going to happen bro but anyway go ahead you know what's funny uh you know so I have to find a way to
(32:49) articulate this the meta meme is usually what I call it but basically to the degree that you do to the degree that
(32:55) you align yourself with the truth which you absolutely do align yourself with love and empathy less so than others let's say
(33:02) I'm a very empathetic person i know that's why you have tolerance for me who you regard as h as the kind of person
(33:08) having empathy as having weakness enabling women to call themselves look the problem No the problem with this
(33:14) mindset is like a [ __ ] okay a m a guy will have a knife or a woman will
(33:19) have a knife and they'll be like "I'm gonna stab myself right in the throat." And I'll walk over knock the knife out of her hand punch her in the mouth yeah
(33:26) how could you be so mean why why don't you have any empathy Andrew and I'm like
(33:31) "No it's the most empathetic thing I was going to say to to the chatter's point one good thing I think that you one
() 
(33:37) inadvertent maybe let's say although maybe I think you do this I think unconsciously you do this on purpose i
(33:43) think and I'm sure you get emails and comments all the time it's got to be upwards of hundreds if not thousands of
(33:49) people have probably started going to Eastern Orthodox churches because of of you right yeah thousands yeah probably
(33:54) yeah thousands okay here's what I think i think that uh a lot of the a lot of young men probably I would assume most
(34:00) of them are young men um watch you they admire the strength that you possess mostly it's married men who are in their
(34:08) 30s who watch me just so you know okay and those are usually the people
(34:13) who are going into the Orthodox churches by the way also married men bring their whole family yep
(34:19) married men are sitting watching in those those whatever episodes the I think I won't even I won't even get into
(34:25) them their w you know why their wives love that [ __ ] i can imagine it's the wives that turn them on they're like "Look at these [ __ ] crazy ass women."
(34:33) Not kidding it's who turn them on then they're like and then I watched it and I was like "Holy [ __ ] this is [ __ ]
(34:38) wild." The point I was making is that um I think a lot of those men will will go
(34:44) into the Eastern Orthodox Church thinking it's going to be a bit more fire and brimstone your your style and
(34:50) then they get there and they're like "Oh [ __ ] this involves like service and praying and like you know actually doing
(34:56) the opposite because what I see but then but then but then that's good in the long run you you brought you you were
(35:01) the gateway drug that brought them into the church and then they realized oh well Eastern Orthodoxy isn't about [ __ ] on women it's about actually
(35:08) you know loving women and loving God and all that and so in your own inadvertent way through your twisted works um you're
(35:16) actually potentially um helping a lot of young men get to an Eastern Orthodox because I would surely
(35:23) you would agree you're not a very uh pastorally inclined Eastern Orthodox
(35:29) person i made this abundantly clear that I do not run an Orthodox channel i don't
(35:34) make orthodox content okay i happen to be an entertainer who also happens to be orthodox excellent so that's that is the
(35:41) case so you better what happens is this what I tell men in general is that when
(35:49) you go to the church you should put yourself in their service put yourself in their service meaning your whole job
(35:56) is the contribution to the community of the church that's what your entire job is not to go in to listen to your priest
(36:04) dunk on [ __ ] women that's insane bro like that's the opposite of what I would tell people see this is why this is why
(36:11) like I said when they bring me on Piers Morgan to condemn you the only thing I will condemn you for is your aesthetic your your terrible uh
(36:18) fictional um tastes because I do I do I do I 100% believe that you are and you I
(36:23) think you are bringing a lot of people into the Eastern Orthodox Church and then making them better for it um
(36:29) by the way that's a side effect that was not that was not the goal yeah yeah but I'm sure it's a side effect that you're
(36:34) very happy about i'm very happy about it yeah and may they go on to be much finer Christians than I could ever be oh but
(36:42) here's the thing low bar Andrew you're really helping them out there let me let me tell you something though here's a here's a big problem that people don't
(36:48) recognize and you're probably not going to like to hear it and a bunch of the u [ __ ] pseudo intellectual uh oh my god
(36:56) you know the the uh the Bible beaters uh they're not going to really understand it and a lot of the pious signalers
(37:03) they're not going to really understand it right but this is the fact the fact of the matter is is that the Roman Catholic church and Protestant church
(37:10) have political arms which are super effective with full of full of guys who
(37:16) uh man you wouldn't know they were Christian to look at them but they're very effective politically right because
(37:22) that's the atmosphere of politics that we're engaged in and it's like look uh I
(37:27) have always said I would much rather represent a political arm move into a political arm which the Orthodox
(37:35) desperately need they just don't know they need it yet but they desperately need it because they're going to start
(37:40) attacking the church in a big way the Orthodox Church is going to be in the next 5 years under the greatest attack
(37:46) in the United States over any other group i promise promise that that's the case because it's growing it'll become a
(37:53) threat to one thing Protestant money and once it that's why Protestants are going after the Roman Catholics because
(37:59) they're starting to take a bunch of the money away as RC as the RC church grows so if the Orthodox church grows and men
(38:06) are giving their money to the traditional churches guess what the femids who have infiltrated the
(38:11) Protestant churches are going to do they're going to name them heretics public enemy number one and they're going to try to politically persecute
(38:17) them and you know what what you need is you need real mean bastards like me at the at the forefront of that so do you
(38:23) regard people like Steven Wolf or Andrew Isker or Doug Wilson as enemies to
(38:29) Christian nationalism even though they call themselves Christian nationalists because they're Protestant no
(38:35) go on yeah well just the answer is no the ultimately the the major thing is
(38:42) when you start moving away from the patriarchy of an ecclesiastical authority there are Protestants who have
(38:47) traditions and do adhere to some kind of ecclesiastical authority where the men are still in charge the problem is so
(38:54) many of the Protestant churches is not the case and women are co-pastors and in charge of various things and so are gays
(38:59) and everything else they operate look at what happened with Trump you go to Trump's inaugural speech i mean he's
(39:06) being inaugurated and they put up an LGBTQ pastor to give him a re you know what I mean just to just to what what
(39:13) was the point of that the point of that was to say "We're not going to allow you traditionalists to have power." That's
(39:19) really what that was about if you think that that war is not coming to the gates of the traditional church then I got to
(39:25) tell you you're not very politically connected because it's [ __ ] coming correct but again this is the
(39:32) fundamental flaw in Christian nationalism partly why I pray to the God the true God not
(39:40) the Well I suppose maybe the God you believe in is the same God I believe in we'll we'll find out in the We'll find
(39:45) out in the end um I pray that you get your [ __ ] together and you bend the knee to enlighten because Christian
(39:53) nationalism will break apart if you cannot reconcile Eastern Orthodox
(39:58) Catholic and Protestant like like how are you how are you going to do that that's what I understand that's the dumbest [ __ ] that
(40:03) I've ever heard i can walk through I can walk through this i've you've been on a lot of whatever episodes heard a lot of
(40:08) dumber [ __ ] than tell me how do the leftists reconcile all their different little there's communists and there's
(40:14) socialist and then there's there's man the ideologies are we doing it are so far in between how tell me PF how is it
(40:22) that they're able to govern even though it is the case that they're completely fractured can you explain that to me the time has come yeah let's do it for me to
() 
(40:28) exercise judgment upon your movement okay
(40:33) Wilson Your movement is based on a weak
(40:40) philosophical foundation called presuppositionalism lame [ __ ] you hold
(40:46) on i got to There we go um you say that uh the reason that the
(40:54) leftists have no moral grounding is because it's ultimately based on preference right i prefer this i prefer
(41:02) that but it's not based on any ecclesiastical authority it's not based on a higher order principle it's not based on a logical axiom is that not a
(41:09) correct critique of the far left no I'm actually fine just conceding to your point everything is just a matter of my
(41:16) preferences just like yours you agree with that then sure what do you mean
(41:21) sure sure interesting this is very different from other Can you Can you tell me why it is that I would be wrong
(41:27) then seizing power under whatever authority I wanted i'm not saying you'd be wrong oh well then well then here's
(41:34) the thing regardless of whatever the philosophical foundation whatever the philosophical foundation is then
(41:40) interesting in which I adhere to I guess doesn't really matter if there's no objection to Christian seizing power
(41:46) right i have seen 10,000 whatever clips of Andrew Wilson telling some bimbo "So
(41:54) it's just a preference?" So it's just a preference no morality needs to be grounded in God and then here I come i
(41:59) turn the lights red and I ask "Well surely Andrew you would your number one criticism is that the left bases it on
(42:05) preferences." And you go "No no that's my favorite part of the left because you always too stupid to point out that you
(42:12) are doing the exact same thing that you accused that is what's happening." No no you always always make this key failure
(42:19) of not following logically to the end let's just say for a second I'm wrong and that all presuppositional
(42:25) argumentation is completely incorrect in its foundations nonsense or nonsense and and Jay Dyer and Jay Dyer's a little
(42:32) [ __ ] which is 100% true an emotionally disregulated [ __ ] let me give the argument so we go ahead we go through it
(42:39) and we go "Okay it's all nonsense this whole God thing none of it's even real none of it's true uh so what?" So then
(42:46) the objections then of basically destroying morality which is what you're doing what you're actually trying to do
(42:53) is you're trying to say there's no justification all you're trying to destroy the concept of morality itself as being obje or objective okay let's
(43:01) just say it's not then what the [ __ ] could you ever object to if I said "Well then me and a bunch of guys who think
(43:06) like me who came to the Christian worldview in a secular way are just going to take [ __ ] everything over."
(43:11) What's the objection what's the objection i'll tell you why because what what people find compelling Mhm is I
(43:19) would say it's transjective it's it's it's it's objective like the fact that
(43:24) someone likes vanilla over chocolate that's an objective fact whether or not vanilla is better than chocolate is not
(43:29) objective so if someone is going to make all the if well morality is not objective it's like okay yes but people
(43:35) are still compelled by certain arguments and certain beliefs so we can say that things rhetoric people find certain
(43:42) things more compelling than others that are objectively true i see so if it were the case that all of Christianity were a
(43:48) lie but I could package it in such a way where people adopted the value structure of Christianity and believed the lie as
(43:55) though it were true for the purpose of good results your objection would be what
(44:00) not at all i'd go "Welcome to teen enlightened centrism Andrew welcome to philosophical pragmatism." So then I'm
(44:07) too nice of a guy i can't I can't wait a second then I can hold all of my crazy right-wing lunatic views to the degree
(44:14) that it produces positive outcomes and and as long as it creates positive outcomes for society you're just going
(44:19) to [ __ ] go along with it and I never have to justify a single one is that what you're saying not only is that what
(44:25) I'm saying Andrew that's what I'm doing perfect well then perfect then let me ask you a question who's popular in the
(44:33) uh field you should run for Congress you should run for Congress you're like Gavin Newsome level just like I you know
(44:38) Charlie Kirk asked him straight up you [ __ ] went to French Laundry during co and Gavin News was like I'm sorry I'm sorry but let me and it's like wow I
(44:45) just got I just got wowed by by Andrew Wilson's uh legendary wit and charm you
(44:50) know you're much I would in my opinion you're far more compelling when you're not acting like a total [ __ ] douche on Piers Morgan and calling women fat
(44:57) and Dunkin Donutsy and stuff did you laugh to be honest I don't think so i did
(45:02) laugh at something else you said i forget what I forget what it was exactly well then I made you laugh and you'll always remember that well of course yeah
(45:08) of course of course of course of course um do you agree that Hold on all right hold on let's step two steps back for a
(45:15) moment okay um so then you agree that philosophical
(45:20) pragmatism is a phen excellent philosophy well I mean it's an excellent philosophy
(45:26) for guys like me to exploit yes that's fine i That's what is the point
(45:32) of philosophy if it's not here to be exploited sure so as long as the point is that my viewpoint tops all other viewpoints for the purpose of Jesus
(45:38) Christ and his church to take over all of humanity if I can utilize your philosophical pragmatism to show you why
(45:45) that's the most pragmatic approach in society and you just go then sure hold whatever stupid belief you want because
(45:51) you're just going to come along for the ride bro right but then it verifies that the belief is correct that ultimately what we do is all based on preference
(45:57) and utility which is true and that's exactly how you act yeah but the thing is is like you're admitting that it's
(46:02) true you're admitting that everything is preference no I'm only admitting that even if it were right it doesn't hurt my
(46:10) position at all is this Am I talking to Jordan Peterson how I'm not saying God is true i act as if it's true oh my god
(46:17) you're a philosophical pragmatist but Jordan Peterson has bled into you two
(46:22) let's separate two ideas sure is the idea that you want to talk to about political pragmatism which is what
(46:27) you're talking about right now or are you trying to go down a line of philosophical argumentation to validate
(46:33) presuppositionalism which thing are you trying to do here well I'm not validating presupposition i don't think
(46:38) presuppositionalism is very valid it's good for it's it's a useful tool for dunking on low IQ did you just presume
(46:43) that no I observed it you observed it i know this is you're this
(46:51) I mean I'm just saying like there's so there's two ways we can do this argument hang on we can do this one word you're
(46:57) like Vosch aua wait wait wait water or or sorry H2O is not what do you mean what do you mean H2O oh is this just a
(47:03) trick of it's saying you can do this one of two ways right you can either go down the route of I want to go down the
(47:10) actual logic tree for presuppositional logic or you can say Andrew I want to talk about the political philosophy of
(47:16) Christian nationalism and why it is that a a centrist pragmatist like me is going
(47:21) to end up going along with whatever it is you [ __ ] want anyway it's like it's totally up to you know what actually okay let's no centrist Andrew
(47:30) let's do both hold on actually before I say anything will you moderate a debate between me and Jay Dyer cuz I hate Jay
(47:35) Dyer and I will debate i can't debate you because you and I we get along too famously okay but Jay Dyer has the
(47:42) emotional IQ of a three-year-old girl and the in the intellectual IQ of I don't know 190 probably which is what
(47:48) makes him so creepy to watch if Jay Dyer wants to do it he'll definitely come on the Crucible to do that debate i think
(47:54) Well he's a coward no he's a coward he probably won't he's He's a little [ __ ] he's a little [ __ ] he already blocked me once he already blocked me once i
(47:59) already asked him to Maybe you annoyed him i'm I have no doubt the truth Yeah the truth often annoys three-year-old
(48:05) little girls when you call them emotionally disregulated anyway Anyway
(48:11) thing to say about my friend you know he's a really super good man who's done a lot don't pull Don't pull the empathy
(48:17) [ __ ] on me Andrew not at this point my feelings yeah yeah well [ __ ] your feelings Andrew what about all that
(48:24) famous empathy i thought I was I wasn't empathetic enough i've learned a lot from you Andrew
(48:30) um okay actually I think the conversation about polit once again speaking to your
(48:37) incredible competence um you know that philosophical
(48:43) pragmatism is the correct perspective which is what you've essentially conceded here
(48:49) i think it's a very I think that all philosophy is very useful for the exploitation of Christians to make sure
(48:56) that our agenda can get passed without ever even needing to bother to justify a
(49:01) single [ __ ] thing never even imagine how awesome it is that Christians can
(49:07) believe 100% that there's that whatever it is that you consider sky fairy
(49:12) nonsense and as long as we go but when everybody believes like us the world's a better place and pragmatists are like oh
(49:19) great well then I guess people should believe like you it's like the most exploitable ideology ever I love that [ __ ] what do you mean
(49:26) I what do you mean I love second I think it's great right and I yes and and not
(49:31) only do you think it's I well like secularist and atheist have gone out of their way to make great because it's
(49:37) true i don't believe it's true but I mean true well no you don't believe it's true that it's great you just said you love to explain it for Christmas i think
(49:43) I think it's great i don't think it's true i know the Listen only the top 10%
(49:48) of your audience now is in IQ is is following along that's fine let's get to the actual try to dunk on this audience
(49:55) they would just have a field day with you bro i don't know like these are actually my audience is actually smart is your is your are there Jay Dyer fans
(50:02) in your audience well when his [ __ ] ass is willing to
(50:07) confront me on your channel right it doesn't have to come on mine your channel and you you're I know you're a
(50:12) trustworthy moderator so you will allow us you will allow me to execute Jay Dyer
(50:18) once and for all rhetorically rhetorically um and so if you're you know if your if your fans think Jay Dyer
(50:25) is a worthy emotionally regulated person I pity them yeah so let's get into the
(50:30) point about the political Christianity you could never in a million years beat Jay Date bro it could it's not even
(50:37) possible well in the same sense that it's not possible to beat a three-year-old child
(50:42) in a physical fight because as soon as you start the fight it's it's it's unfair to begin with so it's fine listen
(50:48) he can he can he can wallow in the corner and cry about it okay that's fine um the polit Let's talk about the
(50:54) political okay Christianity because it is interesting i spoke to Steven Wolf on my channel why Steven Wolf is he wrote
(51:02) the case for Christian nationalism mhm well first off I don't know i have the book what do you think of Steven Wolf
(51:08) and the book and his ideas i think he makes some good points but not Well well I was shocked though
(51:14) to note that he didn't say that we were going to have an armed uprising and take everything over and put all the dejents to the sword isn't that weird cuz that's
(51:21) what I've been hearing the left say Christian nationalism was sure you're talking to a secretly right-wing
(51:29) centrist Andrew so well you don't have to tell me that um I think he makes a good point through the idea of coercive
(51:35) structure that Christianity is properly ordered yeah is the only thing which can
(51:41) ultimately exist for the stability of a society long term i think he's right
() 
(51:46) um he supports blasphemy laws he supports censoring free speech under the name of blasphemy laws mhm if if that
(51:54) ever becomes a mainstream part of Christianity or excuse me Christian nationalism I will reject it and turn on
(52:02) it and and attempt to destroy it to the best of my ability because free speech is prime that's So if a guy's going down
(52:09) No let's like let's mark the principal that's childhood bad regular porn i'm
(52:15) okay with I think I'm okay with banning regular porn so if a guy is riding down the street and he has he has the FM
(52:22) radio on you don't think that the FCC should be allowed to say that you can't have like racial slurs bumping on the on
(52:28) the FM radio you don't think that they should be allowed to censor any of that for the purpose of decency in that
(52:34) example no okay so then why is it that they should be able to censor pornography on television
(52:43) wait regular porn yeah because that's not speech why isn't
(52:50) it freedom of expression right okay here we go this is your presuppositional nonsense this isn't presupping hold on
(52:56) why why isn't Why isn't my watch ask a question why isn't my watch speech cuz it's how do you know that you have to
(53:02) abide by a first cause first principle no no I'm not getting into first principles i'm I'm literally just asking for
(53:12) consistency evident what's self-evident about that european nations have porn
(53:17) playing european nations have playing european nations you can watch softcore
(53:22) corn right on your television during daytime TV okay for let's we're talking in principle right now for I don't care
(53:28) what other countries are doing in principle okay in principle I believe that um it is absolutely essential that
(53:35) people be allowed to exchange ideas okay
(53:42) watching people have sex is not an exchange of ideas now you say "How do I know that exactly where do you draw the
(53:48) line?" It's like saying it's like saying "What's the difference between the color blue and the color purple?" Exactly where do you draw the line at when blue
(53:54) becomes purple it's a continuum so as long as it's on the FM radio waves and they're just reading hardcore corn
(54:00) that's okay um that's better than showing it yeah yeah but it's okay you wouldn't you
(54:05) wouldn't censor that i don't know it's It's You don't know
(54:12) it's a case yeah it's case okay hold on do you agree there's a difference between um like nudity and art and then
(54:18) pornography um yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of Christian art that has nudity in it i
(54:25) just said "Yeah." Okay so how do you know exactly where the difference between art and pornography is the delineations and intent
(54:32) go on that's it the delineations and intent when you're when you're because you're trying to site the Supreme Court
(54:38) when they're like I know it when I see it that's actually bad it was actually a bad argument the
(54:44) truth is is that we do know it and we know it through intent okay that's my line what did you fine that's how I know
(54:50) to ban porn when it's intent when it's intent to just [ __ ] appeal to people's basist instincts yeah but so is
(54:56) music music does the same thing
(55:01) no no it doesn't yes I don't know how aroused you get when you listen to music anymore oh okay so you're driving down
(55:07) the street and you're bumping mechanism pumping i got my gat my AK i'm going to go kill all these nwords over here and
(55:13) then I'm going to go [ __ ] all these [ __ ] over there bro protected by free speech yes yeah what's the intent there though
(55:20) what's the intent is it Is there Is there good intent there bro like what's the intent doesn't matter
(55:26) what the intent is it doesn't matter so why does it matter when it comes to new porn it's for porn that the intent
(55:32) matters how do you between art and porn i don't know you tell me i just asked you and you said intended because I
(55:38) don't have a problem with the regulation of speech you do you don't have Okay i obviously have a problem
(55:45) with No no hold yeah yeah so so hang on listen i'm going to You You have to stop cutting me off let me make the argument
(55:50) shut the [ __ ] up here's the argument you are the one who has trouble who says "Well no i'm an unlimited free speech
(55:57) guy." Okay but not necessarily hang on but I want to But I want to ban But I want to ban corn it's like okay so what
(56:05) happens if these two What if these two people Well I I I mean I don't care right i want to ban porn okay i'm I'm
(56:11) used to I'm used to Tik Tok friendly languages that's right yt people i heard that earlier today so the thing is is
(56:17) like if it is the case that two people say "Well we're having a sexual display
(56:23) which is art it's art you can't clearly delineate intent if they're saying that
(56:29) that's their intent other than you actually know what their real intent is and so you can make the regulation based
(56:36) on that right i would make the same argument for music or blasphemy what is the intent of saying um uh you know [ __ ]
(56:43) Jesus yeah exactly jesus was an alcoholic virgin yeah what's the intent
(56:49) um maybe if Christianity is used maybe if you um what's the intent is there is
(56:57) there anything you're doing there that has a good intention is there anything good there that has a good intention what what what's good about you saying
(57:03) that this the same thing of um making drawing cartoons about Muhammad
(57:09) yeah what about [ __ ] you to Islamism mhm and can you do that in Islam countries
(57:15) no you get killed for it no you can't right do you support that well I'm saying that if if it is the case that Do you support
(57:22) what Islam did to Charlie Hebdo do you think that was an acceptable i think that I think that is in Islamic nations
(57:27) if you believe in the sovereignty of men and those men have constructed that nation under Islam then you're going to
(57:34) have to obey their laws hang on so you Bro you got to let me answer the [ __ ] question oh okay
(57:41) we're in debate though do I do I agree though that you should be able to
(57:47) regulate again no but I'm following a different ethical system they will kill you well they will kill you for drawing
(57:52) the prophet Muhammad christians aren't going to kill you for blaspheming against Christ what they would You would
(57:58) get like a fine or some kind of like public decency charge or something like that oh and then we're back to Jordan
(58:03) Peterson 16 all over again okay so let's say I draw a picture of Jesus um by the
(58:08) way I'm not for blasphemy laws i'm just playing devil's advocate here
(58:15) okay well that's 12 minutes of my life that I just wasted why are you not for that i've never been for blasphemy laws
(58:20) i don't think that they're important i think that ultimately um you stupid guarded pragmat why are
(58:26) you not for blasphemy laws what would you tell Stephen Wolf because because I think ultimately if you're going to try
(58:32) to regulate language like that then you're going to eliminate the idea of discourse altogether correct that's
(58:38) problematic however I don't think that if you outlaw nude nude displays of art
(58:44) that you're going to eliminate discord or you're going to agree that's why you're going to eliminate uh discourse
(58:50) sorry not discord yeah I agree it's a ve it's an easier line talking and exchanging ideas is categorically
(58:57) different than like nudity in any in any format that's like a visual thing um
(59:04) well I think that in order to convince people who are blasphemers not to blaspheme you might you might have to
(59:10) engage in their blasphemy you know what I mean like just in order to have discourse I don't even think takes one
(59:16) to no one so I think ultimately I think ultimately you may you may end up having to engage in their blasphemy in order to
(59:23) convince them now okay now hang on I am going to give you the type of blasphemy laws I am okay with right so if states
(59:31) or local municipalities just like they enact dry counties things like that if they have blue laws or blasphemy laws at
(59:37) the local level I have no issues with that at all none what do you What like in what what
(59:42) does that mean it means that if they have like noise ordinances regulations or you can't say you can't say swear
(59:48) words out in public I think that those localized ordinances are fine um I'm I'm
(59:54) more sympathetic to that like I don't want a bunch of uh Jewbergs let's say people who complain about the Jews all
(1:00:01) the time standing outside of an elementary school chanting death to Jews like I you know it's perfected protected
(1:00:08) free speech yeah it's like I I don't I agree i don't know how exactly I'm that
(1:00:14) okay that that would be down to case by case fine sure but by and large so you you your sympathe so because what I said
(1:00:21) to begin with was if it ever became a a main part of the Christian nationalists
(1:00:26) platform let's say 5 to 10 years from now your success continues to grow and the Christian nationalist movement continues to ride on your coattails okay
(1:00:32) and then else no not hardly but 40% voting block yeah 40% voting block now
(1:00:38) it's like legitimately and one of the one of the whatever the Christian nationalists party's platform is blasphemy laws
(1:00:46) anyone um who uh mocks Jesus Christ or
(1:00:52) or whatever the [ __ ] however the blasphemy laws are in Islam the equivalent in Christianity or something like that a blasphemy law like that that
(1:00:58) Steven Wolf would support it's like okay if that was part of the platform would you would you continue to support the
(1:01:04) platform or would that be a fundamental like [ __ ] this this is too far I would probably support it still yeah okay if
(1:01:12) it were fundamental to the platform so here's why Right it may be the case even
(1:01:17) that I might disagree that it might do more harm than good ultimately for bringing people over to the cause right
(1:01:23) if that if that could be a unifier between different Christian groups in order to kind of pass the agenda I think
(1:01:30) I would be willing to like I don't I don't see the great societal harm here
(1:01:35) in doing that one and two uh if it if it if it would create unity then yeah I
(1:01:41) would be for that type of restriction but I would also say that fundamentally
(1:01:46) I don't think that that's ever going to be the case with Christian nationalism they're not moving No that's not really
(1:01:52) what it's moving towards what they're moving towards is the idea of regulation of uh human behavior especially in the
(1:01:58) physical zones mostly mostly geared towards degeneracy and the idea of procreative marriage that seems to be
(1:02:04) the the primary feasible message of Christian ethics and the idea of
(1:02:09) Christian nationalism same thing with saying we have we're a sovereign nation we can have our own borders we reject
(1:02:15) the idea of unfettered immigration various things like this seem to be all within the ethical purview i haven't
(1:02:21) seen many people and I I did read what Wolf said on this and this was a while ago when I ordered the book i'll have to
(1:02:27) go refresh myself but I think that he makes the same case that they're unnecessary right but ultimately if it
(1:02:35) becomes a unifier then he understands why and he would likely support it so yeah it's the founding father's strategy
(1:02:41) with slavery it's like well we really don't like it but we kind of need everyone to stick together here um yeah
(1:02:47) fundamentally in principle I don't have a problem with it i just think it's less effective of a strategy ultimately okay
(1:02:54) that's fair well this is my point though well I'm glad we're having these conversations and we're we're we're all
(1:02:59) the way on the front end of the meme curve because you know Christian nationalism is what five to 10% support
(1:03:04) right now give it five or 10 years that's a lot it's I agree yeah it's
(1:03:10) uh depends on the other parts of Christian nationalism but like that is one of the major concerns with me is
(1:03:16) it's just it's going to people are going to accuse you of being blasted like you said with the you just said with the um
(1:03:22) what if it's the Protestants are going to come after the Eastern Orthodox Church yeah what if it's just like what if it's just only public though like
() 
(1:03:29) what if what's only public okay so if they're like just out in public you can't say like um you can't you can't
(1:03:36) blasphem in front of other people with an earshot and things like this but in the privacy of your own home you can
(1:03:42) blasphem all you want this and that and if cops came across like some blasphemous picture that you drew at home there's no prosecution but just
(1:03:48) only in public you're not allowed to blasphem the name of Christ like how would that even be that bad now that I
(1:03:54) think about it it doesn't even sound bad okay well you're correct look the idea
(1:03:59) that we should not allow hate speech is in you know it makes sense intuitively like why why who would want a bunch of
(1:04:06) [ __ ] people shouting [ __ ] the n-words or [ __ ] the Jews and [ __ ] whoever [ __ ]
(1:04:11) it's like I don't want that around my kids i don't want that around anything like you know [ __ ] like that so if
(1:04:16) there's public decency laws there I don't what's the problem well like what's the problem this is the
(1:04:22) free speech question because I I would say it's a slippery slope where the moment you allow that you open yourself
(1:04:29) up and say "Well what else should we allow?" You know Andrew's Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox is only like 5% of the Christians in America
(1:04:34) versus the Protestant yeah that's facious argumentation because well you said earlier the you said the Eastern
(1:04:40) Orthodox Church is going to be under attack and you know you know that they're going to use if blasphemy laws were a tool that the Protestants and
(1:04:46) Catholics could use against Eastern Orthodox Orthodox Church they would use it that's the problem yeah i mean from a
(1:04:54) but from a political prescription that would be anything patriarchy would be the thing they would go after before blasphemy laws
(1:05:01) patriarchy would be the thing they go You mean the Eastern Orthodox patriarchy yeah they would go after the the idea
(1:05:07) Christianity is a patriarchal faith and so they would be affirming patriarchy in society i think they would go after that
(1:05:13) before blasphemy laws well but you surely you can envision a scenario where blasphemy laws if they were implemented
(1:05:19) would then get used against people like you i'm sure there are Christians who call you blast this was the same this was the same exact argument made for
(1:05:24) abortion like if you make it illegal um you know there's going to be this massive whiplash and backlash from
(1:05:30) society and it turns out there hasn't really been that bad of a backlash over that way less of a backlash than anybody
(1:05:35) envisioned it turns out that people were pretty [ __ ] sick of women murdering their kids turns out that they weren't very happy with it at all so it's like
(1:05:42) it it could be the case that you enact blasphemy laws and people are like this is [ __ ] awesome that's right you
(1:05:48) can't say bad words about the uh you know Jesus Christ who basically most people in America believe in right so
(1:05:54) you're proving my point of why I couldn't I can't bend the knee to Christian nationals anytime soon because
(1:06:00) it it seems like you're the guy who your entire like you I mean you know full well the discourse you have to like you
(1:06:06) said you have to be able to engage potentially in their blasphemy to be able to have discourse with them and change minds so what if you got here who
(1:06:12) you are even considering like well maybe actually pretty good but what if you got every result you wanted but you just couldn't say f Jesus that's I don't
(1:06:19) believe No see that's the thing is I don't believe reality is set up such that if you attempt to censor people under the name of blasphemy you will get
(1:06:25) my whole criticism against it would be it would produce exactly the the kind of
(1:06:30) why would you agree with it on the localized level then cuz well I don't necessarily I don't know it' have to be
(1:06:36) you don't know why you agree with that i think it's it's a good hypothetical i have to ponder it more yeah think about
(1:06:43) it what are the rules now like I like Yeah there's local municipalities where
(1:06:48) I think that blasphemy laws are still in in state i know that there's at least now don't quote me on that but I know that there's at least blue laws in many
(1:06:54) places where like you can't mow your yard on Sunday or there's noise ordinance noise ordinances are not free
(1:07:01) speech hang on hang on not necessarily yeah I think they are no it's like a air horn is not free expression it's not
(1:07:07) just that though it's the idea that like you can't mow your yard what if you're not even with a hand mower should you
(1:07:13) not be allowed to do that that I'm willing to have is be the gray line of like all right if we're discussing
(1:07:18) whether or not we should allow people to mow their lawn on Sunday on Sunday um that I don't care i mean that I'm
(1:07:25) What about an entire dry county yeah how about no cigarettes either on Sunday yeah what about a whole dry county like
(1:07:30) local ordinances for this uh I that's not free speech so I'm fine with that um
(1:07:36) this is my point though they just fine with it's just I believe in free speech arbitrary listen I'll tell you know what
(1:07:42) Andrew i'll tell you this this is You're right i am I am more right-wing than you apparently because when the when the
(1:07:47) false Christian nationalists come after they've after the coup has happened and they throw you out and they accuse you of blasphemy I will join you in in
(1:07:54) condemning the the false Christian nationalists and saying "You [ __ ] want to use blasphemy laws to silence
(1:07:59) people because you don't like the discourse because you have a you have a particular interpretation of the Bible go [ __ ] you go [ __ ] yourself." You know
(1:08:06) what's really funny i would join you in that crusade here's what's really funny about this yeah if you look at
(1:08:12) foundationalism when it comes to to uh leftwing politics or right-wing politics
(1:08:18) libertarians and conservatives don't really agree on that much they agree on some things right libertarians are is a
(1:08:24) leftwing ideology yeah but interestingly enough when push comes to shove and it
(1:08:29) comes down to like time for power and voting and this and that they tend to vote along the same lines because they have like kind of a a purview an ethical
(1:08:37) purview that is very similar leftists are the same way now maybe you're like a crazy intersectional feminist and a
(1:08:43) moderate Democrat's like that's a little too crazy for me but the moderate Democrat still believes in at least some
(1:08:49) form of like egalitarianism and equity so they share those values and vote along those value lines i don't really
() 
(1:08:55) understand why it is that secularists are always telling me that Christians aren't going to be able to decide what laws or laws to have or not have because
(1:09:03) there's different denominations at our founding right all of the states had a state religion every single state had a
(1:09:08) state and had them pass Hang on had them passed the Constitution via the 10th Amendment for instance salt Lake City
(1:09:15) right now is run by Mormons the whole [ __ ] state is run by Mormons the entire legislature is legislated by
(1:09:21) Mormons we seem to get along with Salt Lake City just we seem to get along in fact with Utah in the Union just fine
(1:09:28) the idea that Christians are not going to be able to work together along the shared ethical system is [ __ ] bizarre
(1:09:33) to me because I don't see any other political persuasion who has this problem when it comes to uh governing
(1:09:40) and compromising governing i just don't see it okay i would say every I would say the bane of every political
(1:09:46) coalition is the inability to keep its members together that's like definitionally the biggest problem the left eats itself is kind of the classic
(1:09:52) example yeah but then they also get people elected don't they yeah sure that's not so I mean so the
(1:10:00) thing is is like look I think that most of the denominations of Christians who follow the Nian creed the Nian creed
(1:10:07) where they believe in trinity things like this they scriptura just read the Bible it's fine no they wouldn't agree
(1:10:12) on the theology but the base universal ethics of the ten commandments and most of the teachings of Jesus Christ I think
(1:10:19) that they have a lot more in common there than they do with any other archet or archetypical ideology politically so
(1:10:26) I don't really see why they could not govern even with different denominations we did it before okay I'll say three
(1:10:32) things number one as you know I very much enjoy exploiting divisions within
(1:10:38) the right within the left because I find that to be the areas of most interest and where truth is to be found and I and
(1:10:44) I think it's important to you know articulate hey I'm against blasphemy laws or you support them it's good to
(1:10:51) know that second well you support them too just saying all in moderation it just
(1:10:57) depends micro or the macro you know all in moderation all in moderation it depends what you mean by blasphemy
(1:11:04) um you said you're like I don't understand why people don't think Christians of the same denomination who
(1:11:09) believe in the Nian creed could get together well the entire history of Europe post
(1:11:16) 30 AD or post like 800 AD um is a lot of
(1:11:21) uh killing each other certainly postreformation yeah so it's the 20th century correct yeah yeah but so what
(1:11:29) that had nothing to do with with religion at all nothing to do with religion at all communism was completely
(1:11:35) antithetical to religion in fact hold on i think it's the 40 years war i could be wrong was between the Protestants and
(1:11:40) Catholics that was St st bartholomew's day massacre was I think 10,000
(1:11:45) Catholics were massacred yeah but I mean the massive historical records were not over Christianity the historical record
(1:11:52) very clearly demonstrates that Protestants and Catholics and Eastern Orthodox can very well not get along it
(1:11:58) is a real threat but here's the problem that you have here we h we can judge history based on how long the historic
(1:12:05) standard has existed and we can see that with peaceful with Christian nations are mostly peaceful secular nations are
(1:12:11) [ __ ] not peaceful the entire historic standard of secular nations have been that they are the least peaceful nations
(1:12:16) which have ever [ __ ] existed on planet Earth all of them i know i just I don't know if that's true oh okay well
(1:12:22) tell me tell me tell me something do you think I don't know when you talk about the United States as it became more
(1:12:27) secular do you think it became less wararmongery
(1:12:32) no I think the neocons took over but there's when the communists took over do you think that the secular communists
(1:12:38) were less likely to kill people than the zar the orthodox zarists are more likely to kill people the other reason I think
(1:12:44) this is of note is because earlier in this conversation you
(1:12:49) said in a few years the Eastern Orthodox Church is going to be attacked by Protestants politically by Catholics
(1:12:55) yeah but but the but the attack will come under the guise of theological oh these
(1:13:02) are heretics or these are these are blasphemers correct no listen right now there exists a a country called Finland
(1:13:09) you've heard of Finland can you Google what the two state churches of Finland are i could do it
(1:13:17) you could just tell me no Google it i don't want to i don't take orders [ __ ] Google it i don't take orders no
(1:13:22) you're not going to Google it yeah because I think if I did you would lose respect for me because you'd be like "Wow PF's a little [ __ ] i just told him
(1:13:28) what to do." Well here we go i'll I'll pull it up so I don't um don't miss [ __ ] it up so the
(1:13:36) Evangelical Tell me then and then tell me the Evangelical Lutheran Church okay okay and the Orthodox Church good for
(1:13:42) them now the thing that's interesting about this you know that they can assess and collect taxes and do on behalf of the government
(1:13:50) great sounds Yeah so they can assess taxes they can literally assess taxes and they have tons of political now how
(1:13:56) could it be that evangelical Lutheran Orthodox both have these giant churches
(1:14:04) giant bodies and somehow are able to get along and govern i can't wait
(1:14:09) i can't wait until the gay female pastors of the Methodist church get half
(1:14:15) of the country in Christian national empire they're Christian they call themselves Christian no listen here's
(1:14:21) what happens nos's will come in and pervert churches and denominations but they fall they fall within 20 years they
(1:14:27) just complete people just flee from them okay hopefully the only reason the Orthodox are growing in the United
(1:14:33) States and the Catholics is because of this very phenomenon you're talking about when wokeism goes into the church
(1:14:38) reaction yeah it's reactionary when wokeism goes into these churches they flee and they flee for the more traditional churches that's always going
(1:14:44) to be the case so the idea that you think that it's impossible for Christians to govern even if they're in
(1:14:50) different denominations there's proofs right now I can point to where that's not the case i don't think it's impossible i'm saying I think that is
(1:14:56) the biggest challenge aside from I mean governing it that's
(1:15:01) every political ideology or persuasion the biggest challenge though is having joint governance correct but you but
(1:15:08) what I'm pointing is you when people talk about Christian nationalism they make it sound like it's a coh it's cohesive it is cohesive as cohesive as
(1:15:16) any other political ideology I can think of okay even the word Christian the the fem the gay female pastors call
(1:15:22) themselves Christian yeah and commun Yeah and communists call themselves progressives you know it's like and I've
(1:15:29) heard communists callentrist it's like what no they would no there's no communist call self- centrist um there's
(1:15:35) no there there's I would I would make the exact same criticism of the progressive left hey guys you say you're
(1:15:40) progressive you say you're just a no true Scotsman fallacy for all political ideologies he's like nobody's really
(1:15:46) that thing everyone's just laring bro it's just a no true Scotsman for all
(1:15:52) political ideologies that's really PF Young's opinion no I think this is your opinion how is it my you wait
(1:16:00) are gay pastors actually Christian even if they call themselves Christian no oh it's a no truth about No no no because
(1:16:06) there's specific criteria what a Christian is oh that's what every Scotsman would say about what makes a Scotsman nope that's not the case and
(1:16:12) here's why if that is the case if you actually believe that that's how the fallacy works then you can't adjudicate
(1:16:17) any political system for anybody ever you can't adjudicate police officers or judges or anything else because anybody
(1:16:24) who said "Well I'm in the form of policing." You can say you're not a real police officer because I'm appealing to some authority to what a police officer
(1:16:30) is does that sound correct to you i I don't even I don't I don't use the I
(1:16:36) don't use the word no true Scotsman fact you brought it up yeah so if the idea here is like what makes a cop a
(1:16:41) cop what makes a police officer a police officer this is what All right how about that answer the [ __ ] question don't
(1:16:46) evade what makes a police officer a police officer um if he hates black people oh yeah you're not going to
(1:16:52) answer right sorry sorry i was watching a lot of uh progressive because the thing is is like if it is the case if it
(1:16:58) is the case you're saying you can't appeal to the authority which says that's a police officer right then
(1:17:03) there's no real police officers they just don't exist all right here we're totally I don't this is fine it's
(1:17:09) we're we're here we are here where we are I go as you know I go with the flow I'm deeply enlightened
(1:17:15) um a world but no cops what makes what makes one an entertainer
(1:17:21) Andrew uh what makes one an entertainer i would say is there such a thing as an
(1:17:27) entertainer yeah exactly well this is my point right so there would have to be some spec specific criterion or
(1:17:32) definition that we can point to that there would be some kind of agreement that that definition was pointing to the
(1:17:38) thing we were talking about just like with man or woman or anything else right otherwise it's an empty label so you
(1:17:44) can't say an entertainer is an empty label because an entertainer right one who entertains would have specific
(1:17:49) criteria so we pull up the definition for instance entertainer
(1:17:54) let's see what it points to appeal to the Bible that's the person whose profession is to provide uh
(1:18:00) entertainment yeah entertainment for others whether it's through music comedy acting magic dance other forms of
(1:18:05) performance so we have specific criteria for what constitutes an entertainer i would say law enforcement we do the same
(1:18:11) thing right one who enforces the laws of the nation does XYZ for some reason though Christians can't have that that's
(1:18:17) weird like everything every other thing can be classified just not this thing PF
(1:18:22) it's the only thing that can't be I would like to change a topic I'm I
(1:18:28) appear to be losing this argument so topic look as long as as long as I don't ever
(1:18:34) see you coming out saying um we're for national blasphemy laws you're not allowed to swear on Twitter aren't there
(1:18:41) Christians that say like swearing is unholy [ __ ] them right Yeah well the thing is
(1:18:48) is like ultimately though these are not the when when we look if we want to look
(1:18:54) at a movement for populism right christian populism is a much more adequate kind of nomenclature than
(1:19:00) Christian nationalism okay so populism itself is taking a look at what kind of
(1:19:07) the viewpoints the popular viewpoints of the people groups themselves are and they're writing on those things in order
(1:19:14) to move themselves into power right so Christian populism is not really any
(1:19:19) different than that what they're looking at is they're looking at degeneracy and decadence and they're trying to make a
(1:19:24) correction for that they don't seem to be moving in the idea of trying to make complete overhaul changes to ideas of
(1:19:31) constitutionality like the second amendment or the first amendment or things like this but rather moving
(1:19:37) within the confines in order to eliminate decadence itself i hope you're correct and I would well show me in any
(1:19:42) of these Christian nationalist populist movements where that's not the case the author of the case for Christian nationalism Steven Wolf said he supports
(1:19:48) blasphemy laws yeah I understand that one guy said that but I'm talking about movements themselves fine i don't think
(1:19:54) he's as inconsequential a figure as you make him out to be i'm not saying he's inconsequential i'm just saying he's not a member of a movement betting on it
(1:20:00) right now what do they say may 12th I suspect Steven Wolf will end up on Tucker Carlson by the end of the year probably andrew Ker was already on yeah
(1:20:08) but when you're talking about populism itself right what is the populist kind of idea behind Christian nationalism
(1:20:14) it's these here's kind of the pillars the pillars are like it's traditionalism
(1:20:21) anti-wokeism one family household uh um promotion right the idea of a of mommy
(1:20:28) daddy being at home with kids right no alternative lifestyle units anti-abortion right things like this
(1:20:35) it's the degeneracy and decadence which seems to be targeted not the ideas of speech itself which seems to be a thing
(1:20:41) which is far less uh consequential and here's some examples of why i go back
(1:20:46) and listen to [ __ ] 1970s60s music it was pretty [ __ ] decadent okay it was pretty bad a lot of
(1:20:54) that music not so [ __ ] great ultimately you mean like the music itself or the lyrics the
(1:21:01) lyrics the music's badass yeah but degenerate [ __ ] right same thing with country music like old country music the
(1:21:08) lyrics are pretty [ __ ] degenerate okay but I don't think that that stuff was really leading people towards the
(1:21:13) primrose path of degeneracy any more than I think that the degeneracy going on in black communities is because of
(1:21:19) gangster rap it's just not there's tons of pretty straight laced guys listening to [ __ ] gangster rap but you remove
(1:21:25) the father from the household and that's where everything seems to go [ __ ] ary for all of these groups doesn't it like
(1:21:32) almost immediately i would agree so I'm not sure that you know Christians are really going to be tangling too much
(1:21:38) over the First Amendment anytime soon and if it is the case that in 40 years they are it's because the popular ground
(1:21:45) swell of people want that and if that's the case and you believe in democracy then you can't even [ __ ] argue with
(1:21:51) that anyway I can't think of anything funny
() 
(1:21:58) um let me ask you this do you think that what you do and you as
(1:22:06) an influencer and your style and the way that you communicate your Christian beliefs and ideas do you think it would
(1:22:11) be better if everyone adopted your style and behavior or do you think it's actually good that there are people like
(1:22:17) you who are more ultraaggressive and then people like like me who are kind and cuddly and empathetic yeah I think I
(1:22:25) think Yeah yeah so I would I would just point you to the parable of the talents and I'd say the same thing there that
(1:22:31) many multitudes of Christians have many many different talents that I do not have um and they use them on behalf of
(1:22:39) the glorification of God in ways that I cannot i have been given the talents that I've been given and I try to use
(1:22:45) them the best way that I can or that I have the knowhow to do uh in order to um
(1:22:52) you know through the best way that I know how to push people in the correct direction which is anti- degenerate so
(1:23:00) that's that's that's what I try to do that's my attempt but I've been given some talents i try to use them the best
(1:23:05) way I possibly can but I do think it takes all sorts of different types of people uh in order to push any type of
(1:23:12) political messaging and some are going to be way more effective at it than me
(1:23:18) um but even but I'm specifically asking if you think that it is for example good
(1:23:24) that there are Christians who are very pro pro-woman and very No oh you don't
(1:23:30) think so at all no well I mean that's just you're just so if you just redefine Christianity to mean not Christian then
(1:23:36) I think it's not good no no I don't mean Okay pro If you just mean pro woman like you don't think women should be [ __ ]
(1:23:42) slaves then yeah I think that's good no I mean like do you think it's good it's in sort of sense it's like a it's like a
(1:23:47) uh good cop bad cop thing where it's like do you think it like do you think that part of the role you serve is you
(1:23:53) come out as the aggressive bad cop and then there are other Christians who go yeah that Wilson guy he chain smokes and
(1:24:00) he [ __ ] calls and dunk a don Yeah right right but like that's nonsense but
(1:24:06) you get his point right like that's there's like a good cop bad cop dynamic i feel like and you lean into the bad
(1:24:12) cop role but I don't know if you think that no every Christian should be adopting your like no we all need to
(1:24:18) lean in and say we need to play these collective women are the problem women are the problem women are the problem
(1:24:23) which by the way I think is I think I think that's not even my message anyway that's how I would interpret it yeah
(1:24:29) women Women are a lot of people Women are a massive problem as a so as far as social contagions go that's true but
(1:24:37) they're not the only problems that's ridiculous okay well about 40 minutes ago when you were
(1:24:43) talking I remember you said something like women women this women that and it was like because talking about some like
(1:24:49) pros position that you had that I was refuting oh yeah actually we were it was a simp hang on it was a simp position
(1:24:56) that you had that I was refuting position that you had was I can't believe that men aren't doing enough in
(1:25:01) society for [ __ ] women that was the position you're like don't men need to straighten their [ __ ] up don't need men
(1:25:07) need to really straighten up and start flying right that was your position bro
(1:25:12) i'm so glad I don't debate because that I never said that that's the dumbest thing i would never say Well I mean it's a paraphrase that's not even an accurate
(1:25:20) [ __ ] no it's not yeah okay well I don't care enough to debate it Andrew all right um I
(1:25:29) I will say one thing that has made me anti-woman is realizing that someone decided to marry Jay Dyer and that
(1:25:35) really [ __ ] Oh come on dude don't do that she's a sweetheart oh I'm sure she
(1:25:40) is yeah then why would you say that that's a horrible thing to say about somebody
(1:25:46) says the guy who called the woman fatty the Dunkin Donuts lady i I would not if if if a woman was was if a woman
(1:25:52) perceived Jay Dyer I think I think I think I think if a woman is happy I don't go after people's families and
(1:25:58) [ __ ] dude I've never done that that's not a thing I do ever oh my god name a time I've ever done that with anybody i
(1:26:05) just don't do unless they're a public figure themselves i just don't do that i don't go after their [ __ ] And usually
(1:26:11) and even go after ideology you know what I mean for the record for the record it was a harm it was a dig at
(1:26:17) Jay that was the joke yeah i'm sure Jay is happily married i don't know his wife and yeah she's a great she's a great
(1:26:22) person yeah just% believe that i think Jay is a little [ __ ] yeah I know that you insult her okay yeah all right all
(1:26:30) right right there's a line too far there bro pro Andrew here defender of woman
(1:26:35) pro marriage pro marriage we're a good team i can get Andrew Wilson to be pro uh pro woman um Okay let me ask you this
(1:26:44) um do you think that uh do you think that I am making a
() 
(1:26:51) mistake by getting friendly with uh some of these super progressive people i mean
(1:26:57) FD signifier is a great thing i mean ultimately well like here's the thing
(1:27:04) your friendship with Destiny will probably always be fine because uh I call it a friendship yeah if you have a
(1:27:10) friendship with that associate associate yeah that'll probably always be fine you can have them over you can suck your dick i mean you can film it you could
(1:27:16) you could distribute it it'll probably be okay uh but the reason I don't have any problem with you being good friends
(1:27:21) with progressives is because that's how you learn when they [ __ ] begin knifing you in the back and trashing you
(1:27:27) all over the place and turn on you in a second because you have some take then you're going to be like "Okay yeah [ __ ]
(1:27:32) these people." Would you ever work with
(1:27:37) progressives if if the contextually I may so like okay if we're on a desert
(1:27:44) island and we need to get a boat to get out of there yeah I'll definitely What if they were what if they were progressives who agreed to reforming the
(1:27:51) divorce courts um no you wouldn't work with them no um
(1:27:58) what I assume you don't care about rank choice voting do you no I definitely wouldn't work with them on rank choice
(1:28:04) voting either do you like rank choice voting no what's a policy that you really support
(1:28:10) that you think the average person or non-progressive would support nuclear power the average person would support a
(1:28:18) progressive the average progressive like and I'm not talking about like an super ideological possessed progressive but your average like I'm kind of
(1:28:23) progressive but you know barely knows like Karl Mars or any of that [ __ ] so a little bit more like middle of the road yeah more middle what is this a policy
(1:28:29) that you support that you think many people who are not necessarily right-wing would also support i think
(1:28:34) marriage reform would be one marriage reform mhm that's different
(1:28:40) from divorce court reform yes be marriage reform itself what is marriage reform well there's a there's a lot of
(1:28:47) different ideas here but uh perhaps a small waiting period before you get married i agree with that that's what it
(1:28:53) do for guns don't we yeah a small waiting period before you get married is one thing which has been postulated it's not the worst idea that I've ever heard
(1:29:00) um but you know regardless of that you wouldn't just be reforming courts you'd
(1:29:05) also be uh reforming the idea that the state had no control over marriage at all and that this moved back to an
(1:29:12) infrastructure of church which is what marriage was always supposed to be that would be a position of reform that I
(1:29:17) think most average people would probably get behind now that said if they're
(1:29:24) progressives which is a different thing about progressives or I'm not ever going to work with them on anything ever even
(1:29:30) if it [ __ ] evil you don't work with Here's the thing bro you don't dance with the devil because the devil don't
(1:29:37) change the devil changes you right oh Andrew I'm I'm dancing with you right now
(1:29:43) um cuz I'm not the devil bro you're not no I'm not don't do not listen do not
(1:29:51) ever ever work with progressives not in a political sense they are backstabbers
(1:29:57) they're evil bastards what would happen is we would get close to to having what we wanted and they'd be like "Oh we just
(1:30:03) want this one change," which is universal healthcare right [ __ ] like that that's what very practical one very
(1:30:09) practical one very practical one anti-war anti-US intervention in Israel
(1:30:16) i I would support that from a right-wing cause but would not work with progressive organizations that cause
(1:30:23) you would not work with what if you worked through back channels like for example what if PFN comes out and we
(1:30:30) forms the anti-US imperialism coalition mhm well you're not a progressive
(1:30:36) correct i'm not but I but I but I know progressives no I wouldn't work with a progressive organization even on
(1:30:42) anti-war policy even if we agreed because 100% what if it was like a single ballot initiative it was a single
(1:30:48) vote all you needed was 51% of people to vote we're not going to blindly Hang on that's different if you're talking about
(1:30:54) in government bipartisan positions which is the only way to get legislation passed at all yes well then yeah that's
(1:31:00) a different story but if you're talking to Yeah well of course you don't have a choice then no no i'm not saying if you
(1:31:07) hypothetically you were in government Mhm i'm saying if you let's say there's a let's
(1:31:13) say there's a I don't know a state ballot initiative and it says we're going to not um send money to Israel
(1:31:22) we're not going to use public funds yeah and I'm in the and I'm in the government no no no you're just you Andrew Wilson
(1:31:27) in the state okay and there needs to be a movement to raise awareness for this
(1:31:33) ballot initiative mhm and I'm heading it as the Enlightened Centers Coalition yeah i keep you in one room and the
(1:31:38) progressives in another room but yeah we're all aligned it's just one bad initiative it's it's a oneanddone task force so that's it no you wouldn't do it
(1:31:46) i wouldn't work with them no because there's always there's never
(1:31:51) anything you'll do with progressives that doesn't have a catch ever now if I was in government itself and elected I'm
(1:31:58) elected now in a democratic manner as a democratic representative that's actually the job they're putting me to
(1:32:04) do is to work with the other side to pass uh resource legislation that's what
(1:32:10) the whole [ __ ] point of that would be would be the distribution of resource legislation so there's the idea of
(1:32:15) allocation of resource and law right that's it that's the whole that's the whole point so it's like that's a
(1:32:21) different position that she would be in there which why I wouldn't want run want run for [ __ ] government or office either right i'd much rather be in the
(1:32:28) background but no I I still would not want to work with progressives on even a
(1:32:33) single ballot initiative they're [ __ ] evil evil dude what happened to evil has
(1:32:39) no ontology they have ontology those people have ontology
(1:32:47) interesting and that their ontology is to remove themselves from the energies of God because they're [ __ ] evil okay
(1:32:53) they're [ __ ] evil bastards well I'm trying to think Andrew
(1:32:59) how can I productively um you you know well then okay so why do
(1:33:06) why do you why do you why don't you think I'm making a mistake by you know being friends with I told
(1:33:12) you because they're going to stab you in the back and that's the only way you're going to learn what they are
(1:33:18) interesting are you ever going to stab me in the back nope and you believe me too don't you that's
(1:33:25) what's so funny right is that you 100% believe me doesn't that piss you off that like when I say that to you you
(1:33:32) 100% believe me but I got a feeling that if any of these progressives said that you wouldn't [ __ ] believe a one of
(1:33:38) them you know that's what's so funny isn't it only time will tell well let me ask you this when I say that do you believe me
(1:33:44) unfortunately yeah see I think I do you see what I mean that's what I feed it's like maybe maybe I'm an uncouthe maybe
(1:33:52) maybe I'm a little unc uh I swear a little too much blah blah blah blah blah right but in the end Andrew you going to
(1:33:59) stab me in the back i say no you're like I believe him so it's like ah well you know I guess you get I guess when you
(1:34:05) take the goods with the badge you can take the goods all the way home to the bank right so just saying
() 
(1:34:11) all right last question how much money did you donate to Shiloh Hendris's GoFundMe
(1:34:17) uh if I had Yeah i would not ever publicly admit that I did me neither
(1:34:23) Andrew yeah or the Carmelon large amount of money that it would have been if I
(1:34:29) had because I don't believe that we should give to charitable causes and
(1:34:35) then try to take credit for things like that for the purpose of pious signaling i've never disclosed what I give to any
(1:34:41) charity on behalf of anybody i just don't do that unless I'm pressed to the point where somebody's saying that this
(1:34:48) guy never gives nothing to nobody and sometimes that [ __ ] gets leaked right but uh but I'm not a pious signaler when
(1:34:54) it comes to charitable contributions i never have been yes so notable notable charitable causes
(1:35:01) like Well that is Well wait a second these people have been doxed they're probably never going to be able to work
(1:35:07) again and a woke mob is literally trying to get them you know assassinated politically assassinated um I don't
(1:35:14) think that they deserve that because she shot off at the mouth at a kid one day
(1:35:20) it's like that's [ __ ] [ __ ] that's [ __ ] and so it's like yeah and people are like "Who's she
(1:35:26) going to make a million dollars?" Like yeah but they're probably never going to be able to [ __ ] work again so yeah it's probably going to take a million
(1:35:32) dollars for these people to live they be able to [ __ ] work again probably for the rest of their life
(1:35:38) you don't got to tell me and I said I I'm not told you I told you I'm not
(1:35:43) donating or I told you I'm not telling you i just said I wouldn't tell you no I think it would be funny tell me if you donated either exactly i what I should
(1:35:50) have done is I should I was going to donate to Shiloh and Carmelo and then screenshot it and post it to Twitter and say this is peak centrism um no i mean I
(1:36:00) I I do generally think as a rule of thumb you should not call a black child the n-word sure no
(1:36:08) dispute call children really any names right yeah but Yeah true but also I
(1:36:14) don't consider that one to be any worse than any other one i do it's a little worse it's a little worse to call a black child the n word if she had said
(1:36:21) if she had said the black child Well here's the thing actually it would be worse if she had just said no no if she
(1:36:26) had just said you know you little [ __ ] this no one would have done anything yeah but that's the point right the
(1:36:32) point is the the contextualization is like from the child's perspective they don't know it either way actually probably would have been worse this is
(1:36:39) probably worse for the child to have this whole thing blow the thing is is like ultimately if this if if it wasn't
(1:36:46) the perfect storm of stabbed in the chest white guy stabbed in the chest a week earlier and gets
(1:36:51) $500,000 based on the political ideology of he was just black that was it that was the whole ideology there nobody
(1:36:58) knows that this was self-defense at all they just gave him a half a million bucks that's what they did so it's like
(1:37:05) okay so you're going to do that but this this woman's going to spout off at the mouth and you're going to [ __ ] go to her house and you're threatening to kill
(1:37:11) her and rape her and do all these horrible things like that's no good that's worse that's worse than calling
(1:37:16) the child the N word yeah I think so and so what we were doing there what people are doing there they're sending a pretty
(1:37:23) strict message they're saying "Look you have every business and right to critique this woman for what she did
(1:37:30) nobody's saying you can't you do not have any business threatening her livelihood her family destroying her
(1:37:36) entire existence and we're going to make sure that if you try to do that to people in the future they walk away [ __ ] millionaires." Now that sounds
(1:37:43) like a pretty epic deterrent yeah look did you see my video on that topic no i
(1:37:48) said this is very clearly a malformed psychological reaction to a very real
(1:37:55) problem which is exactly what you're talking about the white guilt and cancel culture and all and like everyone
(1:38:01) walking around with the [ __ ] eye of Sauron in their phone um I think that's gross um would I personally
(1:38:08) donate once again no comment um I do think it's it's certainly a sad You
(1:38:14) agree it's a sad state of affairs that this is where we're at right
(1:38:19) that you can be Yes brought to you by the left
(1:38:24) am I wrong i'm noticing here am I wrong or isn't it brought to us by the left
(1:38:30) well where's all the right-wing woke [ __ ] cancel mobs trying to [ __ ] go kill every Like here I'll give you an
(1:38:35) example i had a debate with Adam Green one time right adam Green bashes Christians all [ __ ] day every day is
(1:38:44) that more news yeah yeah no more news all day every day non-stop and he told
(1:38:49) me he specifically told me he's like "The entire career of mine bashing Christians every single day calling them
(1:38:55) idiots blasphemy against the Lord he's had one threat one the entire time from one guy
(1:39:02) one nutcase." Yeah he goes south though and he says that a [ __ ] Muhammad
(1:39:08) anything they're all geared up they're ready to kill him they're ready to So in many ways it's a safer topic for him
(1:39:13) right same thing if he goes after the Jewish community they all mobilize for the cancel this and that right-wing Christians are not trying to [ __ ]
(1:39:21) destroy Adam Green's life even though all he does is bash us every single
(1:39:26) [ __ ] day in fact I would argue he probably trusts us more than his secular compatriots
(1:39:33) and that's what's so [ __ ] ironically crazy to me you know I'm noticing a theme Andrew i'm starting to think that most of our problems are coming from the
(1:39:39) left and not the right you've noticed that theme too i'm glad you're finally not
(1:39:45) once again well once again like I said I don't know who is an example of who is too far
() 
(1:39:52) right of you in terms of their Christian politics that's So this gets into the disavow territory and I'm not going to
(1:39:58) [ __ ] disavow that's fine i'm not asking you okay fine i don't do the disavow thing well that's by the way
(1:40:04) that's [ __ ] soundpipe nonsense designed to do guilt by association do
(1:40:09) you think that's what I was trying to do to you just now no I don't think that was your intent okay I'm just saying that your intent or not it'll still be
(1:40:15) weaponized okay fine let me Okay I'll take it back um no names nobody's to the [ __ ]
(1:40:23) right of me is there an ideological position generally that is too far right like for example do you think it's wrong
(1:40:29) to execute gay people okay never mind you know what i don't you No you're not going to answer
(1:40:34) that one either sound by or not oh my god okay that was really funny i
(1:40:41) couldn't help myself bro i could I couldn't help myself this is my No no no i like I look I don't even like capital
(1:40:47) punishment in general okay well this is my point is in some cases like I will
(1:40:52) deal with it though like if capital punishment was something that the right really wanted I'm not going to get in
(1:40:58) their way yeah okay but this is so this is so this is for this is like a fundamental barrier of like you'll never
(1:41:04) get me to agree that if someone has gay sex they should then be executed yeah I
(1:41:09) agree and it would be my moral obligation to resist that
(1:41:16) um not just that law but the kind of you know whatever ideological Yeah but I
(1:41:22) would agree christians would would agree with that but there are Christians who advocate for that yeah not many
(1:41:28) well that's what they said not many yeah there's not many college kids who put pronouns in their signatures and look where we are there's not many Christian
(1:41:34) national there still aren't very many college kids who put pronouns in their signatures you Okay well I would say you're wrong
(1:41:42) corporate America it's on its decline it's certainly on its decline yeah but the thing is is like look here's the thing okay
(1:41:49) um when it comes to the enforcement of Levitical law with like you know killing gays and [ __ ] like no of course not the
(1:41:55) the goal is to reform but that doesn't mean that we have to indulge generously either with gay pride or gay marriage or
(1:42:00) uh glorifying homosexuality in any way shape or form ever that is not a
(1:42:06) necessary conditional for us to also not kill homosexuals you know what I mean
(1:42:11) like it's not a it's not a like either you want to kill them or you want to give them [ __ ] everything and it's
(1:42:17) like that's it's such a false dichotomy agreed agreed i was watching The Last of Us and I was like it's everyone's gay
(1:42:25) now they have to make everyone gay mhm to be fair was gay in the like she
(1:42:31) actually was gay in the game yeah but this is because fine okay fine but it's in the context of everything else anna
(1:42:36) [ __ ] Casperian here's why though it's because Anna Kasparian a leftist feminist by the way PF Young a leftist
(1:42:42) feminist diana Kasparian went to Naughty Dog and it basically made a bunch of
(1:42:48) endless demands that Naughty Dog be inclusive when games [ __ ] right all
(1:42:54) of this always comes from leftist bro every single And the Casparian turned the child gay in the game yes it was her
(1:43:01) influence and she went out and got together again with Naughty Dog for the second game to make sure that she was in
(1:43:06) a lesbian three-way relationship where she says "I'm going to be a dad."
(1:43:12) Thanks Anna [ __ ] Kasparian um oh no sorry not Casparian
