(0:00) you really want to compare the legislative track record between Biden and Trump okay let's go dude stoping
(0:07) dude you know you muted oh I'm being prosecuted
(0:13) oh the only you are child you are a literal child you are an actual
(0:21) child yes yes that's what a child come you okay with that Andrew
(0:28) you've always been a going to change is one day you might have more [Music]
(0:35) kids I think you're really going to enjoy this video if you do please hit the like And subscribe button and
(0:41) comment button it really helps out so let's get started today we're going to be debating the debate and it's the
() 
(0:47) presidential debate debate setion Camala versus Trump Harris versus Trump what is
(0:52) your reaction to what we just saw between Harris and Trump do you think Trump won do you think Harris won how do
(0:58) you think it went and how does it reflect on the race well I think the polls uh across the board have
(1:04) demonstrated that it's somewhere around 50% of the people thought she won the debate 25% of the people thought that
(1:11) Trump won the debate and 25% were undecided so the public at large uh
(1:16) surely seems to believe that she got the better of it by pretty much a landslide Trump seemed like he was phoning it in
(1:22) the entire time it was pretty low energy if you compare his debate performance in 2016 it's quite obvious that he is not
(1:29) the same man that he was back then not quite as bad as Biden in the last debate obviously but definitely uh definitely
(1:35) low energy I think KLA went in there with a game plan to uh get under his skin and rattle him uh and I think she
(1:43) was obviously successful in doing that he spent far less time attacking her than she spent attacking him because he
(1:49) was spending most of his time uh defending himself she would throw a little bit of bait into each answer and
(1:55) he took the bait every single time I think she went into it clearly prepared and she executed on that plan so I don't
(2:01) think there's any question who won this debate Andrew would you like to expand it all about why you think Trump might
() 
(2:06) have edged out on the debate yeah well he just had um he had kind of better zingers the thing is is that Harris
(2:13) didn't present any kind of new vision for America it's just a continuation of Biden policies there was nothing
(2:20) extravagant that she said which stood out there was no kind of great reforms that she's promoting there I mean uh
(2:26) even when I looked at her plan I was looking at her plan this morning in preparation for the debate she's not really doing much she's adding 4% to the
(2:33) corporate tax rate um and that's about it I mean there's not really much in the way of deviation she wants the same type
(2:39) of assault weapons ban she wants all the kind of same uh Progressive tripe that
(2:44) we've been hearing about nonstop for years so there's there's just really nothing that makes her stand out I'd
(2:50) love to hear any policy from any of these liberal scumbags on this panel any policy that makes KLA Harris stand out
(2:57) they won't be able to name a single one not one what if first buyers you made a claim before
(3:03) that we couldn't identify a single policy that she put forward your claim before okay so so you are you able at
(3:10) this moment you said that none of the Democrat leftwing people on this panel
(3:15) are going to be able to identify a single policy proposal that she put out or a
(3:21) newc restate your claim restate your CLA stop talking yeah yeah I'll stop talking go to the VOD I
(3:28) said sing position that made her Stand Out peace how about the how about the
(3:34) what would you think about the purchase of or the construction of 3 million new homes that was a policy put
(3:41) out homes oh really so there so that's what we have
(3:47) here right so anything that we propose that we think will e either be incremental or be different this is a
(3:53) policy that neither Trump proposed that Biden didn't propose it is a novel policy would you acknowledge that Andrew
(3:58) it's novel I think Democrats have been talking about the rebuilding of America through infrastructure every single
(4:04) election of my lifetime infrastructure yes home infrastructure yes of course
(4:09) it's infastructure what is not infrastructure Andrew what are you talking about is everything
(4:14) infrastructure everything that the government is going to build if they're going to build public housing yeah I would consider that to be infrastructure
(4:20) would you would you consider the you know the government is just like uh giving checks to people to spend on their uh rent is that
(4:27) infrastructure no that would be uh like uh welfare oh so what's the definition
(4:32) of infrastructure for you why are we being pedantic with this just tell me what what you want
(4:37) PCO what you're trying to do is you're trying to put a big label on it and say infrastructure and say well it's just
(4:42) the same kind of infrastructure policy as before because look Biden had an infrastructure policy but you know that there's a difference in kind between
(4:49) proposing purchasing homes and purchasing things they're different right this is
(4:54) this a policy yeah yeah not to you because you're going to say anything yeah yeah because next was like oh God
(5:01) did you hear new home nobody said that peace go nobody gives
(5:06) a milon homes Pisco nobody people don't care about people don't care Clearly say why 3 million
(5:13) homes matter and then we'll have Andrew just respond talk clearly the American people have made it um abundantly
(5:19) apparent to everybody that housing prices and the price of housing is a big concern of theirs in fact it's one of
(5:24) the big sources of angst in America and Middle America as well as in other countries Canada UK everyone is going
(5:30) through a cost of living crisis in this country and for Andrew say oh who the cares about houses who the cares about
(5:36) prices and homes show what's going on here what Andrew is saying is I don't want housing to become affordable for
(5:41) people I don't want people to be able to purchase homes and I think that policies that are crafted for that aim are stupid
(5:48) I mean then say what you feel and admit that what you you don't really you don't
(5:54) really care you don't really care hang on you don't really care about people having access to affordable housing you
() 
(6:01) can't even go buy food at the grocery store and they're worried about housing prices it's the most outrageous ridiculous [ __ ] I've ever seen you
(6:07) guys of problem oh I'm out of I'm not out of listen listen they had a jobs
(6:13) report come back it's 800,000 less if I took it to my stockholders and said hey we're going to make 800,000 less this
(6:19) year than what was predicted guess what my stock prices would drop it's same thing here they're lying and and then
(6:25) they turn around and go hey we're going to give you this little consolation prize housing which won't even solve the
(6:30) problem and secondly it's such a drop in the bucket and doesn't affect any of the real issues it's total
(6:36) [ __ ] even with that even with that revision even with that revision Biden had stronger job numbers than uh Trump
(6:44) did even if you uh take away covid losses and gains from from because every
(6:49) work job of milk bro like milk great great argument we devastated the economy
(6:57) we saved made claim it's a simple point he made a point
(7:02) about how they revise the job numbers down but even if you account for that there were more jobs that were created
(7:08) on Biden's watch even if you get rid of uh uh the job losses during covid and
(7:13) then the bounce back the initial recovery if you're making a point about jobs then we need to address that
(7:21) totally anybody who's watching this right now you can look it up yourselves as far as the jobs go there are 5
(7:27) million more jobs in America today than February 2020 before the pandemic and you guys said these are because people
(7:33) have three jobs but the thing is we've had a record unemployment rate it's been below 4% or it was below 4% for a record
(7:41) stretch we haven't seen since the 60s we hit record unemployment 3.4% below even what Trump accomplished so I feel like a
(7:48) lot more people in this country are employed and this isn't the case that you guys portray everybody's got a
(7:53) part-time job everybody does have a parttime job it's well wrong everybody's got
(8:01) a side yeah I don't believe your numbers even if you show them to me I know too many people in my everyday life even if
(8:07) it's osal you can just go ask anybody everybody's got to do two thing do you you can go ask 10 random people
(8:15) at HB or Walmart or wherever and they all will tell you they're doing two things and there's no way this this is
(8:21) what they doal of cooking the books every single time we've already caught you C cooking
(8:28) the books on the job number why would I believe you with this 5%
(8:35) [ __ ] lied about Biden y'all every time y'all say kamala's got a policy half the time is just Trump's policies
(8:41) listen it sounds like you got two half of nothing and when I what basically that equals out to is a whole lot of nothing and Y are sitting here just
(8:48) trying to pass off vagaries and nebulous policy and Buzz words like opportunity economy and say we're going to fix it
(8:54) well you know Trump asked a valiant question hey three and a half years y'all ain't done it's only got worse why
(9:00) why has it uh it been fixed since then and nobody's been able to answer that here the whole world has been suffering
(9:06) through economic problems this is not an American Centric thing so we've done pretty well compared to the rest of the
(9:11) world we sure have and and what's more in two year we've only had Congress for two years and those two years there was
(9:16) a ton of bipartisan legislation passed the chips act the infrastructure act the uh you know other kind of weird like you
(9:22) know gun legislation that was bipartisan in nature had the presidency for 12 the last 16 years PCO like what do you mean
(9:28) like you leader of the all the whole time why does this
(9:34) need to turn into a civics lesson you understand that Congress is the one that you know executive orders are like
(9:40) yeah I mean you act like they don't have I'm when we try to do when we try to do major when we try to do when we try to
(9:46) do major executive action for example and you might not agree with the underlying policy but uh Biden made a promise with to with student loan and
(9:52) you might say that that's stupid or whatever but when the administration tries to do stuff who are the first people suing it's Republican Governors
(9:57) Republican individuals interesting point to me that you guys want to pick a fight on policy when it came to the debate
() 
(10:04) what policies did Trump articulate during that debate besides Paris are you surprised Dr baby Dr I finish Rob went
(10:12) for a bit I want to hear are we doing what about answer nonsense if you want
(10:17) an answer to the question bid got way more legislation passed Biden got way
(10:23) more legislation passed during his first two years than Trump did the very first thing that Trump tried to do when he was
(10:29) president was repeal and replace Obamacare he failed the next thing he did was the tax cuts that the
(10:34) Republicans had been clamoring to do for decades and then what did he get done after that what were his major signature
(10:41) pieces of legislation you really want to compare the legislative track record between Biden and Trump okay let's give
(10:48) me 30 seconds and I okay give me 30 seconds I'll answer this because what Camala Harris is running on as being an
(10:54) Agent of Change why if she's been there in charge for four years haven't they done any of these was charge you resp
(11:00) let me finish you respond with but they actually got a lot of done they actually got to do a lot of what they wanted
(11:07) exactly and the American people are not happy with it so then your counterargument which is well they
(11:12) couldn't get things done that they wanted done but this time they will is [ __ ] as you're admitting they did get a ton legislatively done and America
(11:20) has given it the thumbs down why why we have a historically good midterm why did we expand our majority in the Senate
(11:26) during an economic downturn why did we make Trump a one-term president the first since George HW Bush Bush if your
(11:34) leadership and Trump's leadership and your policies were so popular social issue because of social
(11:41) issues economic downturn it should have been a bloodb so what you guys are saying what you guys are saying is that
(11:47) your policies are not popular people knew no people knew people knew that Trump's economy got shut down they knew
(11:53) it that it got shut when they were pmic Andrew I just quick thing your mic over
(11:59) when you when you talk it like Peaks and it Peaks and it's kind of hard to hear you so he asked why haven't we done all these things in four years it's an
(12:06) absolutely sound answer that um iri gave that first of all we were cleaning up a mess we were in the middle of a covid
(12:12) pandemic and it was a crisis the first thing that the Biden Administration did was pass a Recovery Act you could say
(12:17) it's inflationary but but uh you know you look at economic analysis after the fact they don't attribute it uh you know the the inflationary effect of that
(12:25) policy or other policies uh to those specific pieces of legislation in fact it's a global inflation crisis that is
(12:30) facing the entire world and as iri or Hutch I think pointed out America relatively speaking has recovered better than the other G7 countries better than
(12:37) the other advanced economies um we got a ton of legislation passed I'm willing to fight and defend this Administration for
(12:43) what it stood for and what it got done you point to the fact that you know there are bad polls Trump had bad polls in his term if we just look to polls to
(12:50) determine or the general trend of the economy and this kind of correlation equals causation analysis I mean that
(12:55) would be a great way to defend like the policies of George Bush and during the right before the Great Recession right
(13:01) you have to look more than just how the economy generally was doing or what people think about it generally and look
(13:07) to the policies themselves the last point I'll make is Gib the respon no thinking person thinks that kamla Harris
(13:13) was in charge of the administration for the past three or four years that's Pure Fantasy if you read any of the reports
(13:19) of the Insiders of who's operating things behind the scenes or or whether Joe Biden was in charge in the first few
(13:24) years no one is saying that KLA Harris is running the shell Harris herself has said of many of these issues she was the last person in the room and my statement
(13:30) is Harris is just like Biden is an empty suit that people behind the scenes will be running the same people behind the
(13:36) scenes running the Biden economy or Administration will be running hers right now people are experiencing high
(13:41) gas prices High grocery prices their day-to-day living right expenses have
(13:47) shot through the roof and you're going moving into this election promising them well in the future it'll be better when under trump it already was better so
(13:54) it's easy for people when they're moving into the voting booth in order for uh Republic an to point this out and that's
(14:00) what people are talking about that's what all the buzz is if the situation is as terrible as you're saying why isn't
(14:05) why isn't Trump up 10 points want to jump in of Gibbs but we had two righties we have to have a left respon then I'll throw it back to you Gibbs I'm sorry but
(14:12) there has to be I just want to ask my conservative uh panel people like if if everything that you're saying right now that that Biden's presidency has just
(14:18) been This Disaster for everybody why isn't he up 10 points right now why did she the he was he was dominating against
(14:25) Biden like you know and part of what why isn't he beating
(14:32) cuz she's not B I mean here's the thing y'all threw deao coup after y'all told us hey for months years Biden was fine
(14:38) and y'all took Biden down quicker than a nickel Knight that mother was stucking out of there so fast I've never seen
(14:43) like a prom dress our candidate was losing the election and we pressured him out and now our current candidate is
(14:50) leading the elction Bas and it was based and I'm glad we did it it was not anti Democratic unfort it's too late to
(14:59) guys there's three people talking at the same time I want to ask the panel do we feel like we got to learn more about
() 
(15:05) Camala Harris's actual uh preferred policies and some of the details because
(15:11) like Joe mentioned earlier there's a lot of things that wasn't done in the previous administration she wasn't
(15:16) really pressed on some of the the guts of her proposals so it's like do we
(15:22) really feel like both of the candidates were questioned adequately about their current proposals going into 2024
(15:30) my question earlier about opportunity economy no one was able to Define that I'm I'm very happy well she defined it
(15:35) with with different policies like expanding the child tax credit the $25,000 grant for firsttime homey policy
(15:41) yeah the child tax credit which has been a republican like uh policy why why the Republicans block it from being
(15:47) permanent they blocked it in the Senate from being permanent they didn't they didn't take up the isue call calling it
(15:52) a republican policy Democrats were the ones policy she just picked it up just like tax she's put Trump's border plan
(16:00) border uh wall in her ads she has no real plans block that poliy for the
(16:05) record anybody can look that up this is a tangent discussion it's not answering the question I asked just like yeah it's
(16:11) not answering the question that she gave more details on policy than Donald Trump When Donald Trump was asked about his
(16:17) health care policy he said he had the a concept of a plan that that was one that
(16:22) was One op I ever heard a candidate give on a on
(16:28) a DE you're a presal you you have a concept of a plan
(16:34) you guys want to make this about policy so that's the sound bite that everyone's running with if you go back 30 seconds a
(16:40) minute to that entire stretch of questioning he goes and says we're not going to replace it unless we can get a
(16:46) bill that is cheaper and it has better coverage than the current plan he doesn't have any ideas you didn't listen
(16:51) to his answers listen to the sound no I did but it it's his job to a you didn't
(16:57) hear it you listen to the sound bite he says I'm not going to replace it unless there's a more detailed plan it's his
(17:03) job as a candidate to articulate a plan to any of you conservatives tell us what
() 
(17:08) Trump solution is to bring down the cost to housing I ask you do you know what drill baby drill
(17:14) means well we're already SE setting a record for oil production at 13.3
(17:21) million Donal precisely Biden has proven that we can drill more under Biden than
(17:27) Trump so what would Trump do to increase oil happened once we started increasing
(17:33) oil production I started inre R started to go down the cost of Transit of
(17:39) material the cost of production of material reduced there are several different economic factors that can be
(17:45) eliminated and are addressed by drill baby drill and when Trump says I'm going to do that even more it's going to even
(17:53) how can we do more we're setting a record under Biden that we Trump was unable to do Trump gave them the green
(17:59) light and Biden broke the record we're over 13 million barrels per day in a
(18:04) fantasy land that we're going to do more there's there are plenty of
(18:09) reserves there are plenty of oil reserves we can go to more Federal lands we can unlock more and more offshore
(18:16) drilling heed from our nation he emptied our reserves to flood the market to drive
(18:22) the price down you say that when he started you say that when he
(18:27) started you guys don't give Biden credit because we he emptied our reserves flooded the market and drove the cost of
(18:33) oil down you say when he started one more thing one more thing real quick one more thing real quick you
(18:40) say that when he started producing more oil the cost of inflation went down he started ramping up oil production right
(18:45) away you guys understand that when yes he did you can look at the graph yes I'm I can link it in the chat right here
(18:52) there's a domestic crude oil production right here took a couple of years for Joe Biden to finally start actually
(18:58) increasing oil capacity Across the Nation no it's not true here all right then send the link let's let's talk
(19:03) about the link it's just stopping inflation lowering inflation and what what's brought us down to to 2.5
(19:09) inflation is the Federal Reserve raising interest rates under Joe Biden the
(19:14) Federal Reserve has had excellent policy raising interest rates to lower inflation under Donald Trump throughout his presidency he was asking always to
(19:22) lower interest rates my friend Hutch though I wanted to get you involved and ask you a question I think you erroneously say that the Border secure
() 
(19:29) now I don't believe that but let's just say hypothetically that's true you think that Biden achieved that by executive order a simple yes no be correct or
(19:35) sufficient his executive order did that after pursuing a bipartisan immigration bill that they negotiated for five
(19:42) months with Langford and Cinema yes okay gotcha my question is why did Biden say
(19:47) the Border was Secure for three years and not issue an executive order if he could have done it all the while there's a difference between I think I think
(19:52) what he's doing is illegal and I I disagree with it and I condemn the Biden Administration for doing an illegal executive action okay so my point
(19:59) okay go ahead I'll respond quickly go ahead the problem with the border is the our Asylum laws you guys understand this
(20:05) right our Asylum it is anybody hold on anybody
(20:12) anybody can come to our border and if as long as they go through legal means and they meet a certain set of criteria they
(20:18) can apply for Asylum and when they apply for Asylum they are allowed to come into the country sometimes with an ankle monitor sometimes with a burner phone
(20:24) and these this backlogs takes anywhere between 5 to 8 years are immigration laws were written in the60s well before
(20:31) we saw the level of influx that we've seen during recent times if you want to address the problem at the border
(20:37) meaningfully you need a Bild through Congress which is why he worked with Republicans Langford is a Maga
(20:43) Republican this is not a rhino he himself and McConnell and Lindsey Graham
(20:49) all admitted and and Trump himself admitted that Trump killed that bill for political reasons if you want to address
(20:56) the Border why did he kill the bill I'm sorry
(21:06) Rob he's not allowing
(21:11) you from the point Gibbs that's away now thank you don't worry it's fine let's talk to border first of all let me tell
(21:17) you how dishonest this has being 2016 we uh Trump posted a bill he wanted to get a bill through Congress it had
(21:23) everything they had in the most recent Bill except it had more the only thing not included was the dreamers this is
(21:28) how the Democrats work they use people like the dreamers and then they don't even put them on the newest Bill and
(21:34) even include them and so they sit here and go oh it's by partis etc etc even though the other Bill gave them more
(21:39) judges more of everything they wanted and it gave us the border wall this guy down here Hutch doesn't know what's happening on the border you don't know
(21:46) what's in that bill you don't know what's in I do know imigra
(21:53) judg I can go I can go point for point on it you're wrong you're absolutely incorrect
(21:59) bill in 2016 was in charge of Congress in 2016 it doesn't matter matter Trum let me tell you
(22:05) you're just wrong let me tell you something there's a reason why operation lonar has been uh so wildly successful
(22:11) let me give you some statistics just from the raid on the Eagle Pass Islands we got rid of 10,000 migrants
(22:17) apprehended 52 pounds of fitel 38 pounds of ecstasy 11 pounds of Cain 20 AR Firearms five St that's just three
(22:23) little islands in the middle of the Rio Grand you know why this important because the real problem is not the migration the real problem is the
(22:29) cartels who are taking advantage of the migration who are causing problems who are just damaging ranching here in Texas
(22:34) damaging ranching in other states they're destroying American Property they're shipping fit and all here at a wild cost and so why didn't we pass the
(22:41) Border bill which the border control supported because of what's you're enabling with what with the Asylum laws
(22:46) and not putting up a wall in deterrence you're enabling more and more change the few lefties and liberals why do yall
(22:53) want more sex traffic that's what we're going to get until we have a deterrent
(22:58) I'm anti- why don't you support the Border Bill the border patrol made it clear
(23:05) that they didn't think this was the perfect option you just K him being a basically
(23:11) a sex pest let but you know this is Congress Congress there needs to be agreements there need to be balance Democrats Republicans there was a
(23:16) bipartisan border Bill wouldn't you have supported the bill that the border patrol also supported to be passed
(23:21) Admiral Gibbs yes or no no absolutely not it was not so you don't agree with the border patrol you you disagree with them that it should have been passed
(23:27) listen listen if you are an a always know more than theorder Patrol
(23:33) hold on yeah I guess I do I don't know this is but that's not what's really happening is they're sitting here going hey we're dying out here we need more
(23:40) funding they'll take whatever they can get we're not giving you funding hold on hold on hold on here's what's better why
(23:45) didn't y'all support the bipartison bill in 2016 and threw your foot down on the dreamers and then
(23:51) back was no there was no bip absolutely wasn't 2016 I have the link to the bill
(23:57) if you want it no no no no no no so so so there was going to be there was the concept of an idea of a bipartisan bill
(24:04) but but that never got through because Trump is a bad negotiator and he could have gotten [ __ ]
(24:11) funding let me one second I want to hear piso's alternative version of events then we'll have Gibbs respond and then
(24:17) we got to go to iri and Turk who' have been waiting very so we remember those of us who were around and paying attention we remember the meetings that
(24:23) that Democrats in good faith went toward because we knew Republicans who could have gotten the Border funding on the
(24:28) own because they controlled both the house and the Senate went to Democrats to try to get a deal and in good faith the Democrats are saying Hey give us the
(24:34) dreamers give us that but they were the Republicans put in some poison pills into the into the bill which uh we can
(24:39) talk about which we can which we can talk about but um the Republicans could have passed it by themselves if they wanted to do it but they did not do it
(24:46) because you could not get Unity because Trump's a bad negotiator however again in 2024 when there's a bipartisan deal
(24:52) who's the one who puts it into the ground and kills it not Democrats again
(24:57) trp it's Trump again so ask says he Ked you have a bill that
(25:05) yes conservatives don't think is perfect yes the border patrol hates Biden hates Harris 100% they do but this is a bill
(25:11) they wanted if they were going to have anything because otherwise the option that the alternative was nothing and you say they shouldn't have got what they
(25:17) wanted so how come we should trust you on what's best for border patrol well it's entailed in your own hang on it's
(25:22) entailed literally in what you just said Pisco you just said it was this or nothing right so of course are going to
(25:28) take whatever's offered if you offer a person GRL if you offer a person GRL or nothing and then say well they took the
(25:34) GRL that means they wanted GRL that's not true that is not that is not they didn't call it they did not call it gr
(25:41) they said it was they said it wasn't three people talking it once we
(25:46) we're gonna respon Andrew and we gotta go back to Gibbs because he was the person the question was directed to I understand an entailment to be something
(25:52) that necessarily follows logically does necessarily follow that they wanted it because that's all that they could have
(25:58) did want it they wanted something different than that that's just all they could get the inment that I'm providing you're
(26:05) saying the INF is they wanted they wanted this right no they wanted something different they just would have
(26:11) taken this that's all they did not we need to be clear about
(26:16) what the border of Patrol said what they said was the head of the boorder of Patrol said while not perfect the Border
(26:21) Act of 20124 is a step in the right direction and is far better than the current status quo this is why the
(26:28) national border of Patrol Council endorses this bill and hopes it hopes for its quick its quick passage Donald
(26:35) Trump personally intervened called uh conservative senators and threatened them if they were to give Biden a win
(26:43) during an election year what you're saying is that you know better than the border patrol Union which again this is
(26:49) a divided government you're not going to get some Bill that makes Republicans entirely happy and Democrats entirely
(26:55) happy it did put limitations on our Asylum that would have helped it did hire
(27:01) more immig it did provide funding to excuse me let me just finish to hire
(27:07) more immigration judges it did have more funding to hire more border patrol uh uh agents and Donald Trump killed the bill
(27:15) so I just don't think you guys have a leg to stand on to saddle this entirely on Biden's watch when he worked with
(27:21) Republicans in good faith for months you had the leader of the Senate on the Republican side endorsed the bill lford
(27:28) it's not fake news you can look up the quote yourself they did not call call it rule they were for more
(27:37) funding we got Hutch to admit that actually all it would have taken was an executive order from the Harris Biden Administration to solve everything they
(27:43) instead lied for three years and said that the Border was Secure and it was fine there is no answer from anyone on the left by that the American people
(27:49) correctly blame the Biden Harris administration because they could have solved this with an executive order right Hutch Hutch was the one the
(27:55) question was directed to so I'll get Hutch's answer I don't need answer peace go uh we'll see what Hutch says he's the one that said that the executive order
(28:01) solved all this I kind of want I kind of want to take a different tax so let them finish this up and I I want to ask a different question okay Andrew no answer
(28:09) Rob's question Hutch I did answer his answer his question Andre it cuts both
(28:15) ways if Donald Trump was able to do border wall by appropriating defense funds why didn't he do it the first year
(28:21) if it was such an emergency On the Border what did he do the first year Rob because he was trying to get it done
(28:27) through Congress right excuse me excuse me answer the question it's what about ISM one so you refuse to answer the
(28:33) question said what about Trump yes it is I answered you question he tried to get it he wanted a bill from Congress and
(28:39) Trump killed the bill and he did an executive order afterwards that's not true what in 2021 did Trump kill the
(28:45) bill in 2022 did Trump kill the bill in 2023 Trump build the wall in
(28:51) 2017 because he he could have done it himself he waited three years you ask a question that's amaz that's what I said
(28:58) you asked a question and I'll answer it was an emergency right he could have
(29:04) done I will answer's in trouble right now I'm not in trouble iri please claim
(29:10) that they wanted to stay in their bubble not debate me you should keep your own advice uh the reason is right because
(29:16) you're the person that said that a simple executive order was able to secure the border the fact is the Border
(29:21) was much more secure largely because of the executive orders of Donald Trump when he was there I never said Trump
(29:27) could build a wall by executive order you're the person who said that an executive order quote secured the border
(29:34) right now you can't answer for the fact that if that's all it listen again you
(29:41) did not answer and I'll repeat it why did Biden lie for three years and say the Border was Secure when all she had
(29:48) to do was pass an executive order I I've answered the question I'm happy to answer it again a more meaningful way to
(29:54) address the Border issue is through Congress he tried to get that done when Trump killed that bill he used an
(30:00) executive order that's a lie what congress bill was he pushing in 2021 it's on his website he has a sh which
(30:07) bill was he pushing in 2021 or in 2022 or in 2023 he did push a immigration
(30:13) bill as far as I understand in 2021 I don't I'm not familiar with the specifics but you've only cited one bill
(30:19) that you said was bipartisan so if he did something that was totally different that wasn't this bipartisan bill that
(30:24) didn't have support of Republicans it wasn't just that he could have solved it with a Bill he was literally gaslighting
(30:29) the country so was Camala Harris that there wasn't a border crisis so was I don't think there was ever a point where
(30:35) they were saying that it wasn't a crisis my orcus was testifying in front of Congress saying that our system is
(30:40) stretched Beyond its capacity our current infrastructure along our border was never meant to deal with this level
(30:47) of influx I tried to explain it to you guys before the issue is our Asylum laws
(30:53) it's not people like crossing the border illegally it's our Asylum uh infrastructure being overwhelmed by tens
(31:00) of thousands of people coming from Central South America and Mexico he tried to pass a bill meaningfully
(31:07) addressing that and Trump killed it and so he did an ex uh executive somala go
(31:12) down there to address the root causes of the issue and just just
(31:17) like you're talking about thether Tri later tanks she
(31:23) clearly negotiations with L you're talking about the northern triangle she uh was in charge of a diplomatic mission
(31:30) to help address the root causes of migration from those countries no guess what happened when she started doing
(31:36) that migration went down from those countries every year we announced a uh massive Aid package to Guatemala that
(31:43) Trump cancelled on his watch if you really want to address uh migration from these count how did he cancel it on his
(31:50) watch if she was the the Zar how did he like somehow somehow like take over for
(31:56) bid he was President he canell a foreign aid package that we were giving to Guatemala
(32:02) at the time and guess what the happened migration increase from that country the circum why money anyway it's a way to
(32:09) address the issue if you want to reduce migration you can help them have better domestic situation so there's less
(32:15) corruption less crime more economic you're okay I'm glad you brought up the wall he claims that he built hundreds of
(32:21) new miles of wall then why did we have this massive influx did it help because the bid have been it down
(32:28) no no wait did it help it help he claims that he built hundreds of miles of new wall he didn't
(32:34) it was 52 miles but let's just take him out his word let's just take him at his word uh he I mean he certainly um renovated a lot of uh wall um he
(32:42) said he said this he said that this would like fix the issue and then we saw record spikes
(32:49) so myself and get can I talk for 30 seconds Here Andrew that's a clever
(32:54) deflection again trying to take the bait no we're not trying to take the bait again notice how hunch is once more deflecting from the fact that we saw
(33:00) crisis numbers in 2021 2022 2023 and the Biden Administration was constantly saying it wasn't a crisis they're only
(33:06) pretending to give it now because my testifying in front of Congress saying we need more help we need a bill from
(33:12) Congress you I generously let you talk when you're talking I don't interrupt you so if you could do me the same courtesy I would appreciate that
(33:19) bringing this up during they're bringing this up during an election year because they're pretending to give a [ __ ] about
(33:24) it and just like they pretended to give a for three years and if when they'll stop giving a and all of a sudden we'll
(33:29) see them flying in illegal immigrants like they're doing with Asian migrants this is purely about the record of
(33:35) Donald Trump versus the record of the Harris Biden Administration when it comes to the border and the economy Trump crushes them in all instances yeah
() 
(33:41) so I was just wondering iri said that the nation under Trump suffered from some of the most widespread protests
(33:47) which were out there however iri are you willing to acknowledge that Democrats allow their own cities to get burned
(33:52) down uh created a jazz Chop on top of that that BLM was headed by uh Patrice
(33:57) cull who was a avowed communist Marxist at the head of this and that this had
(34:02) all of the markings of what is called a color Revolution are you willing to disavow the Marxist leadership of black
(34:08) lives matter who was at the Forefront of those riots and Democrats worked right alongside with them are you willing to
(34:14) do that I'm not familiar with any cities that got burnt to the ground I think a building or a couple buildings got
(34:20) burnt hang on hang on hang on Gibbs Gibbs let him let him let him answer to the Communist charge are you willing to
(34:26) disavow the Communists who are in charge of black not a communist I
(34:31) will Leti weirdos they're screw balls I don't care for those people but it all happened while Trump was president can
(34:38) we admit that yeah that Democrats worked with Communists in order to try to hurt the Trump Administration he invoke the
(34:44) Insurrection act then Andrew do you condemn him for not invoking the Insurrection act yes or no no he allowed states to individually deal with these
(34:52) problems mistake was that a mistake no no I don't think that it was a mistake you just said they were destroying cities let iri talk and
(35:00) you up a mistake right stop talking dude if you cut me off every 5 seconds I can't even make my point iri you will
(35:08) admit won't you that the head of black lives matter the leadership of black lives matter were avowed Marxist correct
(35:15) there is no like centralized leadership of BLM that was sending out marching orders Across the Nation BLM had its own
(35:22) little thing in each little city now I understand there were some people at the top of some sort of like National Organization that were some heads I
(35:29) don't disagree with you on that I don't care and that Democrats Democrats specifically were allowing this type of
(35:36) violence to happen in their streets all over the United States they would do it on purpose they would give standown
(35:42) orders to their own police departments to the point hang on iri to the point where it was the first influx of gun
(35:49) ownership that we saw where democr it started actually move the goalpost for Democrats Democrats started going and
(35:54) buying guns in mass in order to defend themselves from these very lunatics later one acquitted one Kyle
(36:01) writtenhouse of self-defense who I remember on your show you tried to verbally crucify I don't want to get
(36:07) into a big BLM thing my whole point is that it happened while Donald Trump was President do you admit that that's the
(36:13) point what do you think Democrats allowed it to happen Democrats localized issues by your own admission you claim
(36:20) these are all localized issues why do you talking when we're in
(36:26) the middle of having this argument if you claim that these are all localized issues right oh BLM didn't have any
(36:31) Grand leadership who was coordinating any of this so it's all localized and it's up to these local Governors local
(36:39) uh politicians to deal with these uh you know kind of riots which are going on in their streets and how did they deal with
(36:45) them iri didn't they just kind of let them do whatever the they want damag property Millions upon millions of
(36:50) dollars in property basically nobody got arrested for any of this and you tried
(36:56) to verb stop stop no there were 10,000 people
(37:02) arrested that summer let you I literally let you get
(37:08) in well you're lying didn't interrupt you once didn't interrupt you once iri can you tell me
(37:14) if Kyle writtenhouse deserved to be acquitted didn't he deserve to be acquitted didn't he I I did not see the
(37:21) evidence I wasn't on the jury so I didn't get to see all the evidence so that's not a call for me to make I respect the jury's decis ision okay
(37:28) that's it but you won't disavow the Marxist leadership either he did I don't know who Marist don't know who's in
(37:35) charge they will circle jerk against communism Andrew is okay liberals will shake hands circle jerk
(37:42) against communism don't worry about it I just want to make it clear I think it's convenient he suddenly doesn't know you
(37:47) suddenly don't know who who the head of beim is it's not who the head of BLM is how do you
(37:53) not know who Patrice cers is how do you they're not household name why would I know who that because you followed cuz I watched your
(38:00) program and you followed these BLM riots I got shot with this little foone bullet man yeah cuz you were anator you were an
(38:06) agitator that's why like Trump was an agitator on January 6 right Andrew okay that's what
(38:12) about I just want to be I just I just want to make sure I'll answer
(38:19) directly we'll directly you're scar
(38:25) me if you want to do multiple debates with you you me's like you have to pay
(38:31) me in order for me to debate yeah pay me platform okay they're both muted both
() 
(38:38) Pisco and Andrew muted bringing everyone peace and joy because you know say one
(38:44) why why do I get muted in the middle of my argument cuz P go inter I was telling you both I was telling you both we got to give
(38:50) uh me and IR M you both because I was trying to give IR bias as [ __ ] go ahead
(38:55) IR let's let us don't be such a baby about it how about that dude stop bitching dude you know
(39:01) you muted me mean you're bitching oh I'm being prosecuted
(39:07) oh you're the only conservative that comes on you're the only one down
(39:12) syndrome you are a child you are a literal child you are an actual
(39:19) child yes that's what a child says that's a child come you okay with that
(39:24) that's a literal 5-year-old let's get back to the debate II were you
(39:30) an agitator I was not an agitator I was there filming content and supporting my local community but I just want to say
(39:36) Andrew I'm a liberal I think Communists and leftists are cringe man and they hate me and they wish death upon me so
(39:42) no I watched some of your content it looked like you were participating in the agitation along with BLM doing
(39:47) everything that you could to push your kind what did I do you when you doing everything that you could to profile
(39:54) this as some type of inequality don't yes
(40:00) watch I was in this is four years ago so I don't
(40:05) recall to but but that's what happened Pisco I was there I actually do follow LEF his content why don't you point to a
(40:10) specific of agitation you just said he said things you can't point to a specific yeah I was getting into it but you just interrupt me so why don't you
(40:17) go trying to go into was crazy doesn't seem like sounds like you're making fun of people with disabilities that's what
(40:23) it seems like no no just Dylan Burns Andrew you've always been a and the only
(40:28) going to change is one day you might have more kids okay now you don't have any kids cuz you're gay my
(40:39) God I didn't bring you are a child my friend you don't know anything about IR
(40:46) if you're accusing him of being a radical leftist you don't seem to make a distinction between liberals and
(40:51) communist you just think you think we're all like literal communist yes you're all communist because you're silly a
(40:59) M about the interest rate so you pouted for half an hour didn't say anything got
(41:07) blown yeah just like Trump after Trump's debate with Biden he requested another debate after his debate with kamla he's
() 
(41:13) now saying that's it I think he obviously got rattled uh she walked right up to him to start that debate
(41:19) shook his hand looked him right in the eyes was staring at him for 95% of that debate he barely looked at
(41:26) her he was totally outclass the entire time I think that was obvious and think the polls reflect that in terms of who
(41:33) is uh better suited to lead the country just take a look at the two parties right now and just tell me what you guys
(41:39) think and if we had more time I would love to have asked my conservative counterparts do you feel like the
(41:44) Republican party is in a better position now than they were in 2016 I think the answer is obviously not the modern
(41:51) American conservative project is in is in shambles the house is chaos they ousted their own house Speaker for the
(41:58) first time ever they had uh one of the worst midterm performances uh in modern history during
(42:05) an economic downturn the Democratic party in contrast is has never been more
(42:11) cohesive and unified in my entire life I like our chances uh I think we're
(42:16) looking pretty good to win the house think we're looking pretty good to win the presidency and the Senate isn't
(42:22) completely out of reach and so I think we are the adults in the room and I think that uh the modern conservative
(42:29) project right now it's just a it's a joke it's ridiculous I think people most people understand this but
