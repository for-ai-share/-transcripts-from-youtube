(0:00) I would say let's try and keep things civilized but that's entirely down to you leftists are just pissed For No Good
(0:06) Reason musk is collecting all these people's information it's like unelected officials at the DMB are collecting my
(0:11) information Elon Musk is definitionally an unelected bureaucrat cutting whatever he decides is necessary he hasn't cut
(0:18) anything what did they cut I don't think that doju even exists I don't think they have the legal capacity to even do what Trump wants them to do Trump was already
(0:24) found to have had people who are working with him collude with Russia Roger Stone did it but he was pardoned by Donald Trump the same Donald Trump pardon all
(0:30) 1600 j6 offenders bid pardons the whole crime family but that's fine you had 8 years to investigate it they had nothing
(0:37) here's Desy Logic for you as long as if bad things are done via the process of law that's fine I don't want to leave us
(0:43) without getting to the really contentious story of the week it's been another Whirlwind week in
(0:49) president Trump's USA from outshining Taylor Swift to banning plastic straws and bringing Do's Elon Musk to the over
(0:55) office somewhat overlooked in the blizzard was Trump's order for a new task force on and antichristian bias and
(1:01) the launch of a White House Faith office led by Tel Evangelist Paula Michelle White Kane the longer the dance the more
(1:09) bees she gets aroused so queen bee starts going into this frenzy and she starts going around and around and
(1:16) around and she goes into vibrations until all the bees get activated and all
(1:21) the bees start going forth and she leads the way by stirring something up angels
(1:26) are being released right now angels are being dispatched right now [Laughter]
(1:39) for Angels have even dispatched from Africa right now could do with some of that energy
(1:44) well Trump says that God saved him to save America and many supporters are fully on board with making America holy
(1:50) again but critics say it's a divisive move that could bulldo the Constitutional separation of church and
(1:56) state here to debate this and much more two controversial commentators who views of this world and indeed the next
(2:02) couldn't be more different Destiny is an outspoken liberal and atheist you said the religion is trash and a substitute
(2:08) the human thought Andrew Wilson is a fiercely committed Conservative Christian and founder of The Crucible
(2:13) debate Channel who once said this about facing Destiny you and Destiny on whatever
(2:19) podcast together been watching some older debates with you and him love watching wipe the floor with them keep up the amazing work you do I doubt it I
(2:26) doubt there'll ever be another debate between myself and Destiny and here's why one blacklisted he actually made a
(2:32) black list and put me on The Black List so even if he says well now you're off The Black List I see no reason why you
(2:38) should engage with him well here you are uh you're both together again to debate
(2:44) I'm personally thrilled that the the reality has come to this point um so welcome to both of you uh I would say
(2:51) let's try and keep things civilized but that's entirely down to you uh it's your debate I'll be in the middle of it uh
(2:57) and hopefully we'll try and get through some complex issues issues uh in a constructive and interesting way so
() 
(3:02) welcome anyway to both of you um let me start Destiny I mean this whole idea of Donald Trump you know making America
(3:09) holy again what is your response to that I feel like we have a lot of issues
(3:16) right now in this country I don't know if our president being a spiritual leader is one of them um I I there have
(3:22) been things that have said about religion mainly in regards to philosophy and how you reconcile like religion with some philosophical positions but I do
(3:29) think that right now there's kind of a crisis of meaning in the United States I think for a lot of people religion can serve as a good foundation of meaning
(3:36) however I don't think that Donald Trump is going to be the guy to I guess usher in that that era of religiosity in the
(3:43) United States at least not for any wholly religious person that I know that would you know look at a person and think oh this is like a spiritual leader
(3:49) that I would want you know Andrew I would have kind of agreed with that having known Trump a long time and never
(3:55) seen him as particularly religious guy I got to say since he got shot he sounds a very different guy about God about
(4:03) religion you know I've spoken to him myself several times I mean including once a week after he got shot where he
(4:09) said you know God must have had a plan for me he must have saved me for a reason he said could be no other explanation for why I came so close to
(4:17) being killed but miraculously escaped I do think he feels that really quite
(4:23) deeply yeah there's no atheist in foxholes as the saying goes right so a
(4:28) near-death experience often will bring people closer to the Divine this is a very common thing
(4:34) doesn't surprise me that Trump narrowly uh I mean very narrowly uh for a turn of
(4:39) his head is still alive uh I'm sure that he could definitely attribute that to uh
(4:45) divine intervention and I'm sure even Destiny would understand why a person would do that he is right about the fact that we do have a crisis of meaning but
(4:52) he also is right and I can concede on this point that an office of Faith with a chick speaking in tongues is cringe
(4:58) and the most iive uh thing on planet Earth is religion it's the most divisive
(5:03) thing when it comes to I mean it's even more divisive than relationships it's more divisive than sex it's more divisive than anything is the topic of
(5:11) religion itself America is already very divided on religiosity with a traditional camp and a non-traditional
(5:17) Camp uh I don't actually think that this was a great move for him to put in this office of faith not BEC I do like the
(5:24) fact that it does signal that it's perfectly acceptable to rule through faith I think that that's perfectly
(5:29) acceptable however I think strategically it wasn't particularly wise as it opened up a
(5:34) dialogue now between the traditionalists who were really Trump's kind of staunch supporters saying what the hell are you
(5:40) doing here we don't want this woman Paula in any way or shape form or capacity representing Christianity on
(5:47) the national stage yeah I mean Destiny some people see magga Christian
(5:53) nationalism as racist Time Magazine said the toxic blend of ethn religious identity politics was was reflected in
(6:00) the prayers and religious symbols participants carried at the US capital Insurrection on January the 6th 2021 and
(6:06) has become Central to the trajectory of the Contemporary Maga Republican party would you agree with
(6:13) that PE Morgan uncensored is now proudly independent if you like the show we ask for only one thing subscribe on YouTube
(6:20) and follow Piers Morgan uncensored on Spotify and apple podcasts now let's get straight to the point support for
(6:26) today's show comes from a business focused on a critical issue Prosperity US national debt is at crisis levels
(6:33) inflation has made life more expensive for everybody and the stock market is precarious it's not to make anyone's
(6:38) financial future feel Grim so what is the solution well a simple one is to opt out of the chaos and invest in something
(6:44) solid and reliable physical gold and silver and there's only one name you need to remember American Heartford gold
(6:52) this company has owned the trust of thousands of customers with an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau and
(6:57) glowing reviews you can see for yourself they offer an incredible range of gold and silver bars and coins they can be
(7:04) delivered directly to your door or they'll help you set them up in a tax advantage gold Ira first class customer

(7:32) or text PE that's p i r S2 65532 that's 866 692 2474 or text Piers
(7:43) to 65532 all the details in the description now on with the
(7:50) show I think it's I don't think anybody can disagree that there is like a section of Maga or farri people that are
(7:56) racist in the United States but I would say that this is a small section and I don't think that it's worth focusing on
(8:02) I think that progressives especially have this tendency to ere exaggerate um I I mean we were all on the internet
(8:08) when people were hunting every single person who made the okay symbol and and saying that they were like some kind of
(8:13) closet Nazi or whatever during The Written House era so um I mean like there I mean there are going to be racist people everywhere but if you want
(8:19) to attack magga and you want to do it through the the lens of their racist white supremist or whatever I mean most
(8:25) people I mean obviously magga is not going to care for a variety of reasons and they shouldn't and even most people that are kind of like looking from the
(8:31) center or even from the center left are going to be like well I don't really know if I feel this way like Mega kind of seems more colorful than they even
(8:37) have been in the past in terms of conservative movements you can just look online and see that um so yeah I don't know I'm not a big fan of those types of
(8:43) attacks towards that I guess ideology towards that camp there sounding very reasonable today Destiny you're
(8:49) right I'm a very reasonable person appear okay well that that is uh I mean he is right uh there are better avenues
(8:56) for which to attack the Maga movement that would actually be more effective Ive for progressives them utilizing this
(9:02) type of attack actually didn't do them very much in the way of good uh in this last election cycle and you saw this
(9:08) from large Progressive commentators and this is all they did son [ __ ] among many others in the political commentary
(9:15) World Bosch other guys like this they hyperfocus on the racial Dynamic issues and Destiny is Right MAA doesn't care
(9:22) and most of the supporters of trump don't care be and most Republicans at this point don't care because it's so
(9:28) overused that essentially if you if you overuse a phrase like this or these
(9:33) kinds of talking points too much their effectiveness just basically gets destroyed so let's move from making
(9:38) America holy again to making America healthy again I mean Destiny he's a
() 
(9:44) divisive character I got to say about Robert dek Jr I'd heard all the stuff about him so the first time I
(9:49) interviewed him I was quite like combative with him and I was I was pretty Charmed by him and quite
(9:55) impressed by him I got to say and I've interviewed him four or five times since and I really don't think we've got the devil here at the
(10:01) head of the Health Service like we got a guy who has a very curious mind constantly asking questions which
(10:07) probably need to be asked about the nation's Health he's also a fine figure of a guy for 70 who seems to practice
(10:14) what he preaches are you are you in favor or against him absolutely against
(10:20) him the I think that there's this talking strategy that people like RFK do that drives me insane and apparently it
(10:26) works for people like you where somebody will say something that sounds on its face reason but if you think about it for like 2 seconds it's the dumbest
(10:31) thing ever like the idea of like well we need to be examin the safety of these Pharmaceuticals like we need to look at
(10:38) the data and it's like well yeah of course how do you think these things get passed or what do you think all the research is for like people like RFK
(10:43) will just say these things that sound good like shouldn't we be doing research on long-term outcomes of you know XYZ
(10:49) drug and it's like yeah we should be and it's like okay well yeah we we do do that of course we do the FDA has a pretty good track record all considered
(10:57) Andrew yeah I mean I think that uh Kennedy is as fine a choice as anybody
(11:03) it's not like uh it's not like these positions have been filled by people in the past who incredible at them not even
(11:08) on the Progressive side often moving into trans issues trans healthare which was a big loser for progressives I think
(11:15) ultimately uh I don't I don't see any problem with this guy getting in there I don't think he's going to do anything
(11:20) harmful and I don't really see any problem with them uh moving into these various agencies and trying to do
(11:26) various reforms I I don't even actually see why progress would be upset by that so Destiny might say well there's things
(11:32) that he says that are already being done uh so he's going to go in and and be somewhat redundant but it's like if you
(11:37) already like those systems and he's already going into the systems I don't even see why that would be a problem right and Desy what I would say is that
(11:44) always strikes me if you ever see pictures from say Time Square or travala Square in London or Sydney or whatever
(11:51) it may be from the 20s right what's the one thing we all notice immediately if you think about it there's no fat people
(11:59) well there's no fat people right they just didn't seem to exist literally they barely existed because people were far
(12:05) more mobile they they had far uh better diets to a large degree um and none of
(12:11) the processed crap had come into the to ruin their lives um none of the sort of
(12:17) uh you know Television Internet and stuff which makes people sit around all day so very different way of living uh
(12:24) and it really strikes me if you look at those pictures today to then the world particularly in the the sort of
(12:31) developed world like America like large sways of Europe we've just got very fat
(12:36) and unhealthy and if all that he achieves in his term as health secretary
(12:42) is getting Americans to really think about that more wouldn't that be a good thing I mean I feel like he can luck his
(12:49) way into a couple of okay positions but the problem is going to be with the focuses and the problem is at the focus in some ways I think is kind of contrary
(12:55) to whatever Maga believes in although it's hard to know at any point in time what Maga believes in but for instance I think that probably the number one thing
(13:01) that you could do to increase the overall health of Americans would be to bring down our average weight and the best way to do that probably would be to
(13:08) find ways to restrict the ultra processed foods the stuff that's like super high in sugar whether that's through additional lab labeling or
(13:15) whether that's through taxes on Ultra processed food or sugar either of those I think would be tremendously in a good
(13:20) direction however both of those things are what an increase in taxes and an increase in bureaucracy I don't know if
(13:25) Maga is in favor of either of those things if that was the sole focus of RFK I would be more okay with it but it's like this obsession with like the
(13:32) fluoride in the water and red dye number three and the heavy metal microplastics in our ball sacks and everything else
(13:38) and these things are are very like they're worth looking at but they're on the peripheral they're on the edge what
(13:43) if what if he right I mean the reason I say what if is right is I remember through covid for example all sorts of
(13:49) definitive statements from doctors and scientists which often turned out to be complete baloney you know what if he's
(13:56) actually right about this stuff he can be right so for first of all most
(14:01) of the statements that were said by the people on the other side were completely totally incorrect relating to covid and vaccines there were no Mass deaths there
(14:07) were no Mass injuries uh vaccine injuries there were no uh microchips planted in us there you know there were
(14:13) no permanent vaccine passports um there still isn't any proof that it was created in elabor like all all of those things that not being correct um but in
(14:20) so far as him being right I'm saying that like it might be the case that uh microplastics or red die number whatever
(14:26) could be bad for us or could even be cartic maybe but these are like 2% 3% issues like 80% is if you could bring
(14:33) people's weight down on average by helping our diets it would be so much more impactful and I don't see how you do that without increasing the
(14:39) bureaucracy because you have to be anti- capitalist a little bit youve got to start taxing certain things you got to Target certain types of foods in order
(14:45) to change people's food consumption habits yeah I mean Andrew it's a fine line isn't it between being relentlessly
(14:51) critical of Health institutions and accepted norms and Science and so on and
(14:57) getting to a place where if you're not careful public confidence in all of those bodies collapses and then you
(15:04) start to have serious health issues yeah that's true and this is part of the polarization in the United States
(15:11) uh you know Destiny brings up this point he says well these are kind of tangential issues microplastics things
(15:16) like this the truth is we have states that have done restrictions on things like this they've restricted sugars
(15:23) they've restricted some processed foods it does very little to mitigate the problem I'm reminded of uh an article I
(15:30) read not too long ago about Japan where the you know the Japanese don't have the same epidemic when it comes to obesity
(15:37) uh that we have here the uh the gal who was there doing the article made a great Point she said she thought the kids
(15:44) there were trolling when they said their favorite food was broccoli celery things like this uh but when it was
(15:49) investigated turns out they were taught that those are the good foods to eat and nothing else is the good food to dat so in other words there's National
(15:56) propaganda around the idea of health and things like this instead of moving towards restrictions like Destiny's
(16:02) proposing I would move more towards National propaganda but progressives are very wary about moving towards
(16:08) propaganda I don't know why even though now propaganda itself has a negative connotation I'm just saying the word
(16:14) propaganda because people understand what it means right like a national campaign for something like this could be very effective the same way they do
(16:20) it there what's not effective though is restrictions that doesn't seem to do very much at least it has not so far I
(16:26) also think parental responsibility has got to be massively reinforced just
(16:32) generally right it's all very well BL that would be part of a national campaign though in order to do that no no I agree I agree but you do actually
(16:39) you know like when I see some of the food that parents give their kids not just in America but we have it in the UK
(16:44) as well got a massive obesity problem here and it's like where's the parental responsibility to stop shoving horrible
(16:51) yeah but then we have to look at other things progressors don't want to look at like okay alternative family units single motherhood the intact family
(16:57) things like this which all feed into the idea of how kids are even nourished at home like these are all interconnected
(17:04) things and it's not so fun then if you're running a national campaign to say ah father should stay in the home
(17:10) that's good for the family that's good for the kids nourishment things like this you know what I mean suddenly they that's why they try to tend to steer
(17:16) away from that type of uh of public discourse at least at the governmental level even though for the health of the
(17:22) nation probably would be quite good so Destiny your your sheer progressiveness is going to stop any solution being a
(17:30) achieved uh I have I'm a deeply unpopular person with a variety of people I have no problems talking about
(17:35) um attacking a particular problem from a multitude of angles I think that you can talk about what goes on in the household as well however I think that the culture
(17:43) you know r large and and what's available is also a really a really challenging thing to deal with if you've
(17:49) had a kid and that kid has gone to school the thing that makes that kid want something more than anything else
(17:54) isn't just something being available it isn't just uh you know someone on the internet offering it it's when other classmates have that thing you know as
(18:01) soon as you start hearing hey Bob or Jane you know their parents let them do that or they have this thing at school
(18:06) well now all of a sudden you're competing against all of the other kids in class and then these types of pressures when your kid is outside of your supervision are almost impossible
(18:13) to to overcome one thing that is kind of irritating I guess is I feel like there was a big push to have kids eating
(18:19) healthier in schools a while ago but everybody made fun of her for it it was led by Michelle Obama when it came when it came to making healthier foods in
(18:25) schools I agree yeah and and it seems like Republicans up like crazy for that and I don't know I I think that yeah I
(18:32) mean we can talk about healthier food in the household we can talk about healthier food at schools like I I think that everybody should be on board with
(18:38) it because things like obesity being overweight is one of the worst things that you can do for your health yeah
(18:43) it's interesting I was out in Saudi Arabia uh a couple of weeks ago and they've got a a national campaign to get
(18:51) people out doing exercise three times a week and they got a very young population like 70% or under 35 and it's
(18:57) been very popular you know and as a result more and more young people in Saudi are playing sport for example than
(19:03) we're ever playing before uh and that is physical education standards here Piers we had physical education standards set
(19:10) down by the government here for years uh and those were rolled back due to the idea of fat shaming doe the idea of oh
(19:17) my my you know my kids can't do this which is all [ __ ] I agree it's all it's all [ __ ] and the thing is is
(19:23) like those that's what I'm talking about when we're talking about National campaigns for this we can we can bring
(19:28) bring in exercise standards we can bring in enforcement mechanisms for those standards starting at a young age
(19:34) Destiny makes a good point it is valid that if you're in school and you're a kid and the other kids have Donuts
(19:39) you're probably going to want a donut you don't want to eat your broccoli right but there's an aspect of social shame that happens with patriotism and
(19:45) aspects of social campaigns and culture that can be actually done from the top down that we see in other nations
(19:51) including what you're talking about right now just something as basic as okay physical education now we're going to actually start taking it seriously
(19:57) you know there's two hours of it a day instead of just the 30 or 40 minutes of of you throw dodgeball at each other
(20:04) right I think that these are very valid things that we should look at yeah I agree let's turn to uh
() 
(20:11) feminism so Donald Trump has been lorded as the great new feminist of the United States this comes from his executive
(20:18) order Banning trans uh athletes in women's sport uh let's take a look at
(20:24) him surrounded by uh grateful women and girls as he did this
(20:29) you know if you'd like to gather around me I think I'm going to be okay come on come
(20:40) on secret Services worried about them if we have to worry about them we
(20:47) have big problems okay you I don't think I've ever seen a finer feminist uh
(20:54) Destiny I mean I mean this is like classic Republicans like Donald Trump tweets out at 400 a.m. that he's going
(20:59) to make the sunshine and then at 6: a.m. the sun comes up and everybody worships him for it um I'm pretty sure didn't the NCAA already roll back a lot of the
(21:06) trans participation in sports um in the United States and then I feel like we've already seen like the Olympic make moves
(21:11) against it like I don't we've already seen like I mean in your country in the United States across the world people have kind of like rolled back a little
(21:18) bit on a lot of the trans youth especially the medication stuff you said the phrase there when you say it's been a little bit and it's been peace meal
(21:24) sport by Sport and age groups and so on what Trump has done with One Sweep of his pen is say no more of it at all
(21:32) right there will be no more trans athletes in women's sport period now I
(21:38) personally think this is absolutely the right thing to do I think it's become the new doping where people who have an
(21:44) unfair Advantage have been you know beating women removing women from
(21:50) women's teams and say the Olympics and so on uh actually beating up women as we
(21:55) saw in the Paris Olympics where somebody reported ly banned from the world championships with male chromosomes
(22:02) literally beat up one female opponent so badly she quit after 40 seconds in the ring so I do think this is a really
(22:09) important thing do you agree with him I don't think this is a very important thing um I don't even know if
(22:15) he can enforce this through executive order like I don't know if this is going to be like some kind of Title 9 UM challenge or whatever I don't know what
(22:20) the courts are doing with this right now it's just I just don't think this is very relevant in the overall scheme of of us or World politics right now I mean
(22:28) people don't want women competing with trans women especially at the college level and Beyond I don't really have a problem with that I never really had a
(22:33) problem with that I don't know if these two groups of people should be competing with each other I just this's like a blip on the on the grand scale of things
(22:38) I think you know what's interesting Andrew I talked to quite a few on the left uh since the election they've moved
(22:45) from the position before the election I'm not saying Destiny was one of them I can't remember but and you can clarify if you want Destiny but a lot of them
(22:51) are like absolutely trans women should be allowed to compete in women's sport
(22:56) uh blah blah blah blah blah and Biden and Cara Harris supported this with actual policies endorsing it and now the
(23:03) position is you know what nobody cares it's it's a thing I don't I don't have a view I don't have a view and I I think
(23:10) it's because to their shock and horror the single most effective political ad
(23:16) of modern times turned out to be that trans ad that Trump did ending with carelas for they them Donald Trump's for
(23:23) you but also including this issue of women's sports and women's safety and the are putting you know I mean as we
(23:30) had in England in Scotland actually male a male rapist who suddenly identified as a woman who got put in a woman's prison
(23:36) it cost the first minister of Scotland a job um I think it's a big issue far
(23:41) bigger than Democrats want to admit and it's interesting The Narrative has changed from we're all in favor to
(23:47) actually it's just a small thing we don't care about it yeah this has been a major setback for uh lgbtq period the trans issue has
(23:56) been the entry Gateway for the uh one of the most brutal attacks against the left in modern times and uh
(24:04) all you really have to do is just ask basic logistical questions like okay which prisons do they go to you know
(24:09) what I mean we P we were past bathrooms we were into prisons and can children get gender reassignment surgery things
(24:16) like this this has always been a very very unpopular position for leftists but
(24:21) they can't really back away from it because the T got attached to the LGB right so they could never really back
(24:28) away from it they've had to kind of defend it tooth and nail uh to Destiny's credit he's always had a more nuanced
(24:34) position on this of I don't care at least to my knowledge but ultimately this is not popular for them it's never
(24:39) been popular for them when you're talking about what Trump is doing with the gender binary has somewhat disagree
(24:45) not that he the thing I agree with is that he proposed at at a you know a government top- down level the United
(24:52) States only recognizes two genders now he means Sexes male and female right that's what he's he's alluding to there
(24:58) but I do think it actually was very punishing for feminists to uh have
(25:03) fought all those years for their sports teams and then have men just go in and kick the holy [ __ ] out of them right um
(25:10) and so that actually mobilized yeah but but I mean it mobilized a lot of those feminists to move away from the left
(25:17) because they were like wait a second this actually wasn't The Liberation we signed up for right we spent all this
(25:23) time fighting for this and now you can just basically put on a wig and go break all of our records Rec I I mean it's
(25:29) just a huge loser for the left and I agree um Des I want to read you a quote
(25:34) from Andrew Wilson uh he posted this week the most disappointing thing about feminists is how made out of glass they
(25:40) are with the slightest push back they break they demand equality until you talk to them like you would a man it's
(25:47) actually comical would you would you concur with him I mean that's everybody
(25:52) in politics I mean everybody's a snowflake depending on what the issue you're talking about is um I I don't think that it's ever been huge issue on
(25:59) on most of the left when it comes to trans stuff I think there's a vocal minority on Twitter and in colleges that
(26:04) scream about it I think it seems like it's a huge issue because Republicans wanted it to be a huge issue even that commercial you were talking about was
(26:10) quoting something that comma said in 2019 so it seemed like some huge you know everpresent issue but I don't know
(26:16) I I guess I'm looking more towards like like domestic policy like things related to immigration or Healthcare or what's
(26:22) happening right now in our executive branch or foreign policy like I thought the war in Ukraine was supposed to end
(26:27) on day one I didn't know that we were signing up to be owners of Greenland and the Gaza Strip and the Panama Canal U
(26:35) these things I think are are are more important at least to me but I don't know maybe some people are really powered by what Republicans think I
(26:40) don't know got 13y old daughter I got to say if I was living in America she was born
(26:47) there actually but if I was living in America with a 13-year-old daughter who likes sport I would be very exercised
(26:53) about this and particularly if you have to share uh changing rooms with biological men who said I'm now a woman
(27:00) yeah I think I think I'd be more worried about my daughter like dying in Texas like trying to get a medical procedure done because she I'm pretty sure there
(27:06) been three deaths now so far in Texas of of um young women that are pregnant that can't have medical procedures done
(27:11) because the doctors have to be so careful when they're doing them that they they can't accidentally abort a fetus because then they'll be held liable for Crime so I think these are
(27:17) things I'd be worried about more than trans athletes which areally being killed in a boxing ring by
(27:24) a trans athlete how many times has this happened well it hasn't but it will do
(27:29) exactly but it but it already has happened with the abortion so that's that's what I'm more worried about yeah yeah but children children's gender
(27:35) reassignment surgery that is something which has been on the table for a long time that's one and two when you're
(27:41) talking about this issue it's kind of revisionist History right now suddenly the Democrats don't care oh we we you
(27:47) know it it was always a vocal minority no it really wasn't these were very very public fights going on at the national
(27:53) level and the reason is is because this was a moral question we're talking about a moral question from the Viewpoint of
(28:00) the Christian right which most right-wingers are Christians you're actually assaulting their religion
(28:05) you're assaulting their idea of what moral grounding even is so to them it's a huge deal for Destiny who has a
(28:11) completely different moral prism it's really not a big deal right he doesn't he doesn't really care about it's not that important but to more to the
(28:18) average person at least to the average right-wing conservative who's a Christian it's a huge deal the assault
(28:23) of the moral Foundation is something they're going to take issue with it's going to be one of their top priorities orities so it to say that Democrats were
(28:31) not fighting tooth and nail on behalf of trans inclusiveness including in sports
(28:36) and everything it's just insane revisionism of course they they absolutely were I look at someone like look at someone like JK Rowling who got
(28:42) absolutely you know destroyed by the woke Brigade for standing up for women's
(28:48) rights to fairness and equality now everyone Lords her for her heroic stance
(28:53) but at the time most women put their head under the understandably put their head Under The Vicious parit and didn't
(29:00) want to engage and that left people like her out on their own getting completely killed by people who profess to be the
(29:06) beind uh Lobby um and too wit I wanted to play you this Destiny because it really annoyed me not because it's a
(29:13) comedian making a joke that's absolutely fine nor that I want her banned or canel or any of those things just about the
(29:20) the blatant hypocrisy of what we're about to hear this is Chelsea Handler talking about Melania
(29:26) Trump I am your Dei host Chelsea [Applause]
(29:34) Handler it was a huge year for biopics a complete Unknown about Bob
(29:43) Dylan Maria about Maria
(29:49) Callis and Anora about Melania
(29:55) Trump now destiny what she's doing there is calling the first lady a hooker okay she's perfectly entitled to say that but
(30:02) she would never have done that joke and nor would any comedian have ever done that joke about a Democrat first lady at
(30:09) an award ceremony ever so my my question is are the Democrats again is it one
(30:16) rule for them one rule for everybody else before you do the well the Republicans do other stuff I know they
(30:21) do uh and it it it just seems to me she would never have done that and nor would
(30:27) any comedian if it was a Democrat first lady I just I so don't care I I mean
(30:34) like what is a what is the question was the joke too mean or would she not have done it towards she probably wouldn't have done it towards a Democrat because
(30:40) those types of people all tend to lean left that' be my guess right the same way that if it was any right laning comedians are probably not going to go
(30:45) super hard on anybody on the right I mean that seems pretty obvious you're asking if it's a mean joke I I mean yeah it's a mean joke that lots of people
(30:51) tell mean jokes I don't know what kind of no it's not about the mean joke well a I think it's not really a joke it's just calling the first lady a hooker is
(30:58) vile the majority I like I hear a ton of conser right now that say that Michelle Obama and the wife of um the the French
(31:05) macron are trans like I'm pretty sure that's Candace Owens she said I would stti my entire career on MC's wife being
(31:10) trans not a ton of cons jokes about the Michelle Obama
(31:16) stuff being trans but I don't know yeah well the Michelle Obama dick jokes are very old and have been going on for a
(31:22) long time right I've seen those you've seen those um and some of them are kind of funny but the point is is is that
(31:28) with with Chelsea Handler here there's one of the most promiscuous women in Hollywood calling someone else a hooker
(31:34) by by the way hilarious and also you're talking about an entire party who is pro
(31:39) sex work pro sex worker pro- prostitution Pro only fans does everything it can possibly do in order
(31:46) to enable those things uh and then at the same time they're like I can't believe the first lady's a hooker it's
(31:52) like if it was anybody else who wasn't a republican they would probably glorify it they'd be like fine our first
(31:58) prostitute first lady like I I don't I don't even understand why um you know
(32:04) the the depths of the hypocracy here is actually kind of outrageous right yeah I I completely agree I think the joke the
(32:11) joke has more to do with pointing out I think the hypocrisy on the other side for instance if you make a joke about like I don't know if we're allow like
(32:18) for stepen Crowder being gay that's a common joke that people on the left make I don't think the joke is haha you're gay so that's bad I think the joke is
(32:23) more you hate this thing and you are this thing which my guess is going to be I didn't see her whole performance know the movie refence she was making but
(32:29) that's probably the joke is that you guys hate prostitutes and you are a prostitute you hate gay people you are gay no that wasn't a joke that wasn't
(32:35) the joke she's just basically calling she's calling Melania Trum a hooker because she you know she wants to imply
(32:40) that she's actually a hooker and I I think that the point I'm making is not that she's not entitled to do a what I
(32:46) think was a crap joke of course she is she's a comedian it's the fact that you would never ever see it an award
(32:52) ceremony in America I can ever remember any comedian right or left
(32:58) make that kind of remark about a Democrat first lady a current first lady
(33:04) from a stage televised at an award show that's that's thing I haven't seen I
(33:09) haven't seen every award show but like didn't Stephen Fry do a couple of really brutal award shows or he was like throwing it out to almost everybody am I
(33:16) making this up dude well he's English okay all right let's move on gu
(33:24) you get away that no I don't I just don't think any of them have ever a first lady hooker it just seemed to me I
(33:30) don't know it just it's all about crossing a line in comedy and all that if you do it Down The Comedy Store you can do what you like if you're on
(33:35) Twitter or X now if you want to do things okay fine I'm not going to say you should be C thought we learned when
(33:41) that guy made the island of floating trash Puerto Rico joke I thought we learned there were no lines anymore why are we crying about her making this joke
(33:46) now well no because the left went completely nuts they they thought he did cross a line well now we've
(33:52) learned now you now you going just joke about anything I guess right we're all in that world well you should be joke about everything I mean but we can we
(33:59) can also we can also joke about her being uh you know one of the most promiscuous women in Hollywood and that
(34:04) she's speaking out of both sides of her mouth here because she's been a big-time supporter of sex workers and now
(34:09) suddenly believe she's a hooker it's like what are you talking about that's a good it's a very good point that she used it as a slur having professed to be
(34:17) the complete opposite about sex workers very good point um talking of stinking Hypocrites and vile people let's come to
() 
(34:24) Kanye West um who started the week parading his wife Bianca sori naked on
(34:30) the Grammy's red carpet um we're looking at these images now it was a deliberate
(34:35) dering uh whatever I mean obviously any woman can do that um I thought it was all a bit cheap and embarrassing and
(34:42) pathetic and I certainly wouldn't want to be doing that with my wife on a red carpet um what was far more serious to
(34:47) me was what Then followed which was literally just a bombardment of horrifically
(34:55) anti-Semitic racist comments um and then some pornography that he began flying
(35:01) out um one of his posts sometimes you have to do it like the Pharaohs make your Jews work for you but watch them as
(35:07) close as you can whip your Jews um what was interesting to me uh Destiny was
(35:13) ultimately Elon Musk I messaged him directly on X publicly and said you're
(35:19) gonna keep letting this guy do is he's breaking every single rule that X has about this kind of stuff so the normal
(35:26) rules weren't applying to it and he was doing it to 32 million people so from the Free Speech argument is one
(35:33) thing actually the ex inhouse rule book is another that wasn't being applied so
(35:38) it seem to be one rule for him one rule for everybody else um but secondly it was clearly in my in my opinion when you
(35:45) start talking about making Jews your slaves and whip them you are actually um
(35:51) now committing a crime you're inciting actual violence against a group of people that is a crime it's not
(35:56) protected by the First Amendment but what was interesting was Elon Musk only intervened and shut down the account for
(36:04) the NSFW pornography which was completely legal so you know inciting people to
(36:12) violence against Jewish people was not considered to cross a line but actually
(36:17) posting legal pornography was I thought that was an interesting contradiction
(36:23) what do you think yeah I feel like um Kanye was to me it seems pretty sad because I feel
(36:28) like it's pretty obviousy his mental issues um relating to what is he bipolar or whatever so I don't know if he has these manic phases where he just starts
(36:34) going crazy and I don't know if he either surrounds himself with yes men and fires everybody else or if there's just a bunch of people like the Candace
(36:41) is in the world who are just around him to take advantage of him but I mean clearly he has these mentally unhinged
(36:46) moments I'm sure him being as famous and as wealthy and as successful as he is probably doesn't help with that Mania um
(36:53) as for rule enforcement on X I mean there's a million things that could be said about that people have had a lot of complains about Elon coming on um
(36:59) obviously a lot of people from the left you feel like the platform has gotten a lot more hateful a lot of people have said that the platform's got a lot more
(37:05) spammy there's a lot more bot activity and everything some people on the right over the H1B Fiasco were upset that Elon
(37:11) seem to be banning people who previously would have been okay because of their political slash racial stances I guess
(37:17) or whatever so yeah it seems like elon's been having a little bit of trouble getting a handle on how he exactly wants to present X's moderation to the world
(37:24) yeah I mean Andrew I interviewed KY West um year and a half ago and he he denied having any uh mental illness certainly
(37:31) denied having any treatment for any mental illness and a lot of Jewish people in particular think it's just an
(37:36) excuse that he just actually is a massive attention seeker it was the Grammys he's no longer a kind of you
(37:43) know uh Superstar rapper in people's eyes he's just become this pretty unpleasant troll um and that he was
(37:50) doing all this to suck attention away from the Super Bowl from the Grammys and so on what do you think where's the
(37:56) truth about West do you think I mean he's done he's done this before I mean he had a meme presidential campaign
(38:02) right total meme ultimately uh the yeah though people though people uh some
(38:07) people took it seriously U most most people in the mainstream most certainly did not take it seriously um and yes
(38:14) it's attention-seeking Behavior stripping first of all this is not the first time this has happened remember that uh that his wife also was in
(38:21) controversy because she had a cross on her buttock uh you know her naked buttock and then now she uh is at the
(38:28) Grammys and what happens um she he literally takes her clothes off disres her uh humiliating by the way absolutely
(38:36) humiliating I felt I felt ashamed on her behalf I hate saying that right but I
(38:41) actually I was just I I just couldn't believe it right the disrespect towards uh towards your wife that's to me in
(38:47) many ways unconscionable when it comes to the ex thing though the freedom of speech what we're talking about here is
(38:53) this line in freedom of speech which you're right Elon Musk has not figured this out yet because it's not really possible to figure out is it okay and
(39:01) this is what Kanye West trying to say is it okay to PO post as much uh you know
(39:07) sasas and iHeart Hitlers and you know everything else on this as I want and if it's not why isn't it yeah why can't I I
(39:14) thought this was about freedom of speech pushing the number and that drives attention to that account and in many
(39:21) ways it could have been a tactical move by musk to say well you know maybe taking taking that down is not going to
(39:27) look good on me and so when the when the time came when porn came up he pushed it a little further right okay they're not
(39:33) Banning my account he's actually letting this go how do we push the number a little bit further then he moves over to
(39:39) okay let's po post hardcore porn and then finally Elon mus says okay enough you know uh I try to do the best I can
(39:45) so he's trying to find musk is trying to find this line Kanye is purposely pushing the line so that he can test the
(39:51) limits of uh musk and the this free speech on X and try to point out hypocrisy this kind of thing but yes I
(39:57) agree it's for attention in a big way I don't think anybody would disagree with that even his supporters yeah um let let
(40:04) turn to the the Trump Elon over office presset uh we've got a a sort of
() 
(40:11) this some of the things that I say will be incorrect and and should be corrected so nobody's going to bat a thousand I
(40:18) mean any you know we will make mistakes but we'll act quickly to correct any mistakes um so uh you know if if the I'm
(40:26) not sure should be sending $50 million with the condoms to anywhere uh frankly I'm not sure that's something Americans
(40:32) would be really excited about um and that that is really an enormous number of condoms you think about it Destiny
(40:38) what what did you make of that obviously it's very unusual you've got a the richest man in America standing next to
(40:43) the president of the United States in the Oval Office by the Resolute Des he's got his kid with him who's picking his
(40:48) nose it's all a bit random and weird and surreal however I did watch it all and I kept thinking to myself if I was an
(40:54) average American watching this hearing what Elon Musk is doing to Federal overspending I'd be cheering him on I'd
(41:02) be all in favor of this yeah unfortunately the average American I guess or the average person
(41:08) has no idea how government works or functions and I guess weird and surreal is just the way to describe now or
(41:13) illegal I guess is the way to describe that this Administration has decided to address programs that they don't like um
(41:19) if you want to cut down on on waste Fraud and Abuse I don't think anybody would necessarily have a problem with it but they keep saying waste Fraud and
(41:26) Abuse when what they mean is programs that I don't like and they've already taken several almost certainly illegal
(41:31) actions in trying to basically unilaterally dismantle organizations like USA that have been independently
(41:36) authorized by Congress that the president doesn't have the ability to do uh to dismantle unilaterally and now you've seen TR coming out from the
(41:43) Judiciary that's telling him hey you have to stop there was the the one on the federal um the federal spending freeze that not only did was a t issued
(41:50) telling him you have to stop freezing these funds now another judge has said you are violating the TR you need to
(41:56) stop this immediately um so I guess if you don't care about the legality or the process and procedure or anything having to do with
(42:02) the structure of government I guess it's a cool thing but if you care about like following the law or the rules or maintaining your government then it
(42:08) would probably be a horrific thing but Andrew yeah you got this idea uh I've
(42:14) heard Destiny kind of talk about this before when he's saying okay these are illegal actions and possibly the Court's
(42:20) not going to be able to catch up with these illegal actions and so Trump is just going to basically continue with what he's considering to be illegal
(42:26) action thing is is like people forget about things like jury nullification or like the the idea that you can have laws and
(42:33) even if you're the the enforcer of the laws in this case the executive branch you don't actually have to enforce these
(42:39) things there's no there like you're put there for a reason just like a jury can nullify a law by saying even though the
(42:45) law says you're guilty I can still come back with a not- guilty verdict What's Happening Here is we don't even know
(42:51) what the waste Fraud and Abuse is uh and so there's an audit going on and this is exactly what musk is doing they're
(42:58) trying to audit this and get it in front of the attention of the American people to say look we don't want condoms for
(43:04) the Taliban that was 15 million uh promotion of Atheism in Nepal for 500,000 French lgbtq programs in West
(43:11) and central Africa for million right I mean the list goes on and on and on $200 million 20 days in I think that the
(43:19) American people do deserve to know that and I don't think that they would that this would be front and center or a thing we would be focusing on absent
(43:26) this audit and I think that more of these government agencies should be audited now destiny can get he can say
(43:32) well you know technically due to the rule of law we have judges who are making these impositions and this and that it's like yeah that's fine but
(43:38) that's all part of the process too it's all part of the process of law the process of law is playing out exactly like it should judges are supposed to
(43:44) create injunctions if something illegal is going on etc etc there's nothing wrong though with auditing these places
(43:51) and for the spirit of transparency I think that leftists are just pissed For No Good Reason like they they go oh is
(43:57) collecting all these people's information it's like unelected officials at the DMV are collecting my information the unelected officials at
(44:04) the Social Security offic are collecting my my information like so many government offices collect my
(44:10) information by people who I definitely didn't elect and neither did Destiny they're totally fine with that but for
(44:16) some reason with these guys no that's too much I that's a good point I mean the reason well the reason why is
(44:22) because these things have been no these things have been authorized by law there's a process and procedure there the Social Security Administration was
(44:28) created by Congress there's a process and procedure by which they collect data and they have a process and procedure by which they store data and who's allowed
(44:34) to access it Elon Musk is definitionally an unelected bureaucrat who is now part of a shadow government who is going from
(44:40) agency to agency cutting whatever he decides is necessary in terms of there
(44:45) being transparency all of this already publicly available they're literally they've literally shuttered the USA
(44:51) offices what do you mean they've literally fren payments from the treasury shuttered them in
(44:58) they to a mass recall saying all the employees needed to come home which was stopped by a trro by a judge and now a
(45:03) lot of these programs there was just recently a report by um the head of the uh treasury guy who now is fired um who
(45:09) was saying that there's a whole bunch of food and stuff that we shipped to other countries it's just going to spoil because now we've cut off funding and money for it um all of these things have
(45:16) just been unilaterally cut by Elon Musk and Trump without any authorization from Congress despite the fact that Congress was the one that authorized the funds
(45:22) for these programs and authorized these offices and agencies if you want to remove all of these things that's funny you don't want $500,000 being spent for
(45:29) Trans ballets and Nepal for atheists or whatever which whatever that's fine if you don't want it then Congress has to defund it that's the way that this
(45:35) process works it's not up to the president unilaterally to decide what he likes or doesn't like that's already been H by the Congress H it's not up to
(45:43) you that's actually I was going to say look that's not actually correct he's he's entitled to do this and then
(45:49) absolutely well hang on hang on then they could be legal challenges and Trump made it clear in the overall office
(45:54) yesterday he would accept what a said now by contrast I remember Alexander
(45:59) aesio Cortez when it came to the Texas ruling in a court by a judge about
(46:06) abortion uh medication for example she said that the Democrats should not accept what that judge had ruled right
(46:13) so why is it one rule why is it one rule for Democrats that they can ignore a
(46:18) judge's order with impunity but when President Trump says president Trump says if you want to challenge this no
(46:24) problem I would accept the the the rule ruling of the judge isn't that democracy what years was AOC the
(46:32) president of the United States what difference does that make when does it have to do with anything she she's not in the position to do these things she
(46:38) can give the advice on it if you want me to ask uh myself like's eled laer who doesn't want to obey the law a lawmaker
(46:45) she's in a different branch of government she's part of the legislature we're not talking about the legislature we're not talking about a random lawmaker right now we're talking about
(46:51) the president of the United States doing things to intentionally content you can't just say you can break the law did
(46:57) the same student loans no he absolutely didn't when the Supreme Court shut him down in one thing then he took a
(47:02) different avenue it was not the same President Biden did not ignore temporary restraining orders it wasn't issu T to
(47:08) stop what he was doing with the um with the with the loan forgiveness it's a totally different thing this is not the same it's not the
(47:15) same process other people have said over and over I'm responding peers Vance and
(47:22) others have made it clear over and over again they they've quoted the Andrew Jackson quote and they've said well we should just the Judiciary it is not part
(47:28) of Law and Order it's not part of checks and balances for the executive to say well I don't care what a judge says we'll just do whatever which is what
(47:34) they're currently doing and a judg has already said they've done with the trro that was placed on them having to do with freezing uh Federal funding so
(47:40) they've already broken with what the judges are telling them to some extent and at the end of the day there's no way to check and balance the executive if
(47:46) they're just going to do what they want to do you have no checks and balances there what are the are men in robes and lawmakers going to walk down and fight
(47:51) with the US Marshals and the FBI like it's not going to happen Andrew yeah right exactly so an issue what you have
(47:57) is an issue of authority so uh Trump is ex he's trying to expand the limits of his office as fast as possible and I
(48:04) understand why uh last time he was there they were trying to impeach him from basically day one made up this phony
(48:09) rush in collusion uh nonsense he he comes in now he has nothing to lose he's going to expand his office as quickly as
(48:15) possible try to move things as quickly as he possibly can and most importantly he doesn't trust the judicial branch
(48:21) that's what he said himself in his various speech I don't trust him to give Fair rulings I don't trust that are
(48:27) actually there uh in in respect to actual law he doesn't actually even
(48:32) believe that so what he's doing he's quickly hang on hang on hang on my turn so he's expanding it as quickly as he
(48:38) possibly can but he did say that he would abide by the rulings of these judges he just recently said this and we
(48:44) don't know what's going to what's going to come of that right now he's expanding he's expanding this office to try to
(48:50) figure out these audits this type of thing I don't see what he's actually done wrong you're already panicking but
(48:55) we haven't really had a chance to see what happen if he abides by these rulings doesn't abide by these rulings we don't really know that yet right
(49:02) itself is probably aolly illegal agency I don't think that Doge even exists I don't think they have the legal capacity
(49:07) to even do what Trump wants them to do number one um number two the bringing up the Russia collusion stuff is funny when
(49:13) the entire foundation for Hunter Biden and barismo was entirely fabricated that person's already been convicted by the FBI for lying about the origination for
(49:19) that and three Donald Trump was already who were working with him collude with Russia Roger Stone did it but he was
(49:25) pardoned by Donald Trump the same way Donald Trump pardon all 1600 j6 offenders people that were that Biden
(49:33) does the whole crime family right pardons the whole crime family that's fine yeah how many crimes they committ
(49:40) Republicans Republicans had like eight years found nothing how do you know you had eight years to investigate it what
(49:46) do you mean how many special how many many years inv nothing you been
(49:51) investigating him from as soon as from as soon as Biden was in office they've been investigating this guy hunter Biden over and over over and over and over
(49:57) again they found nothing that's why they the day for tax well for Joe bid they found nothing ever
(50:03) they going to make your points any better I just want to make sure that get back to the actual pointy if none of
(50:09) them have committed crimes why do they all need preemptive pardons yeah they all need part Trump is shown over and
(50:14) over again that he doesn't need crimes to start chasing down people and and the Republicans have no problem hunting people down to try to to go on fishing
(50:21) haven't been doing for the last year give me one example stormy bloody Daniels honestly did he break a law did
(50:28) he break a law also that wasn't the federal government that was the state are you honestly happine only americ
(50:35) hang on hang on the only time an American pres like the law no I don't care only time an American president was
(50:41) ever D for a criminal cor was over a one night stand with a porn star 20 years ago utterly prop it wasn't over a one
(50:47) night stand it was over misappropriating campaign fs and creating a paper trail you can if you don't like the law that's
(50:53) fine You' had presidents like Obama waging illegal drone programs killing thousands of innocent people why is he
(50:59) not AAL as per who illegal as per who which crimes what are we talking about you don't think illegal because it
(51:05) sounds illegal as for who oh you think that you say illegal because it sounds bad apparently
(51:12) so by George Bush the the for which what are we talking about for illegal Invasion
(51:18) illegal I'm talking about crimes which crime which crime what crime you talking crime misappropriate campaign
(51:25) I'm making the point making the point the only time an American president has ever been dragged to a criminal court
(51:31) was not overrunning illegal drone programs or illegally invade invading Sovereign countries it was over an
(51:36) alleged one night stand with a porn star involved a bit of paper shuffling it was completely ridiculous you just you have
(51:43) strong feelings about what you think should be a crime or not but if you don't care about the law there's no legal argument to be had that if you just think it's a crime because it's bad
(51:49) you don't like it or you think it's a crime because it's a big deal that's fine but I mean like if you want to have
(51:55) for things are done via the process of law that's fine but if you do good things after the process of law that's
(52:02) bad it's like what are you talking about man I know here's here's here's my chain of logic I it was hard to follow if you
(52:07) are a criminal it's because you've broken a law not all bad things are criminal okay not all bad things are
(52:15) crimes you can think somebody did a bad thing but they didn't commit a crime Donald Trump committed crimes in New York state probably committed crimes as
(52:21) so far as Georg is concerned and he's committed federal crimes as so far as the maragal documents case was and the j6 case was he won't be held accountable
(52:27) for all of that thankfully because he's dismissed he does everything he can to elude accountability but those are crimes if you want to say I don't like
(52:32) the war in Iraq and that's illegal illegal as per who we could talk about the icj or the ICC if you want but that
(52:38) gets obviously way more complicated what crimes yeah it wasn't my point my
(52:44) point was to say that from your view all you're you're only concerned about process of law in this case not about
(52:52) not hang on hang on hang on not about not about the moral implications of the actual waste fraud abuse that is is
(52:57) brought up only that the technical process has followed so it's like okay but what if they're not Tech they're not
(53:03) following your technical process but they're actually finding ways foren abuse from a moral implication that's
(53:09) actually a good thing now I don't even agree with you that uh that they're breaking any laws I don't even agree
(53:15) that they're breaking any laws these challenges are brand new we have no idea how this is how this is going to play
(53:20) out you don't I don't and we have no idea if's to ad to what the court is
(53:25) going to say no we don't have good idea you have no idea what you're talking about it's not we don't know for sure that Trump is going to just go oh I'm
(53:32) just going to Jackson the courts uh the courts can enforce their own law like that is speculation that's beyond the
(53:38) pale done that a judge has already issued a ruling saying they've already violated a TR so that's already happened
(53:44) to some extent now how far will it go who knows they've already done exactly that Doge does not have the legal authority to go in and unilat they're
(53:51) giving a legal challenge back they have they legal chall back the
(53:56) the response was oh we're going after fraud and the judge laughed that he said this isn't even a respon that doesn't mean that doesn't wait wait wait so so
(54:04) yes they are not only are they going to respond to this but they're setting up for legal challenges to go back the
(54:10) other direction this is obvious and by the way this is part of the process like I don't know why you just pretend like
(54:17) uh uh these politicians don't expand their offices all the time and that's what the judicial does right it comes in
(54:22) it'll Reign it in it'll say this is constitutional it's not constitutional you can do this you can't do this they do it all the time there's so much
(54:29) precedent for this in fact so if he doesn't adhere to what the judges end up saying to what these courts actually say
(54:35) when he has no more legal standing to fight it then you have a league to stand on right now you don't he's acting acting the best he can
(54:43) in the ability of the Office of the President of the United States CH we will see goal so so the goal should be
(54:49) to just break as many laws as possible then and then see what happens Trump has made it clear he'll accept the ruling of the judges if he doesn't that's another
(54:55) matter um I want to that doesn't even follow anyway likees follow logically we're running
() 
(55:01) out of time I don't want to leave us without getting to the really contentious story of the week which is paper straws uh let's watch a clip of
(55:08) Donald Trump talking about straws we're going back to plastic St these things don't work I've had them many times and
(55:16) on occasion they break they explode if something's hot they don't last very
(55:21) long like a matter of minutes sometimes a matter of seconds it's a ridiculous
(55:27) situation so we're going back to plastic straws I think it's
(55:34) [Applause]
(55:41) okay and I don't think that plastic is going to affect a shark very much as
(55:46) they're eating as they're munching their way through the ocean okay Destiny can we at least agree that
(55:53) that paper straws suck or rather you can't suck with a paper straw you know
(55:59) what I'm going to be like a good conservative just despite conservatives I'm going to buy a thousand paper straws I'm going to replace every plastic straw
(56:05) that I see in a straw from now on with the worst the shittiest paper straws that dissolve the second you put them in your [ __ ] soft drink that's my goal
(56:11) for the next two years that's my way of protesting Andrew your response to that dramatic statement from Destiny about
(56:17) paper straws well then I have to at least counter with buying a thousand plastic straws right just to I but
(56:24) anyway uh you know I drank of these stupid paper straws last time I was in Santa Barbara going on the whatever
(56:30) whatever podcast and they do suck and they do dissolve quickly and uh everything tastes like cardboard when
(56:36) you drink through these straws but there's also all sorts of chemicals in them I'm not even sure that they're
(56:41) safer than plastic no uh and there's a lot of data on this too like they dissolve the drinks into the mouth um
(56:49) and they have all sorts of chemicals preservatives in the paper um the Baseline plastic is non-reactive
(56:56) uh there's all sorts of like little things that you can point out here that is problematic when it comes to paper straws themselves but ultimately they
(57:03) just suck like if you're going to replace like what you know what people in California do they get metal drinking straws right right and then they use the
(57:10) metal drinking straw they just bring their drinking straw with them yes like U maybe maybe maybe that maybe that's a
(57:16) good alternative I don't like the idea necessarily of drinking out of plastic I don't think that's a greatest idea but
(57:21) the paper straw thing was always stupid yeah I agree uh well gentlemen we're going to leave it there it's been I got
(57:26) to say it's been I'm I'm pleasantly surprised by the T the tenor of our
