(0:00) uh the pardons of the violent criminals
(0:02) on January 6 is unacceptable except for
(0:05) the fact that it was super obvious that
(0:07) he was going to do it okay Andrew your
(0:09) response yeah so there I mean there's a
(0:12) whole bunch of problems here so uh the
(0:14) first problem is these were not violent
(0:16) criminals who were released these were
(0:18) political prisoners who were released
(0:20) what what happened is there's there was
(0:22) no fair application of the law
(0:24) whatsoever these guys were being tried
(0:26) in DC uh there was a political witch
(0:28) hunt we have more evidence every single
(0:30) day which provides for that and why
(0:32) these guys are busy now uh complaining
(0:34) and showing us oh down here on the
(0:36) border uh we have a mom crying because
(0:39) she might be separated from her kid
(0:40) nobody's commenting on the fact that we
(0:42) have a ton of families that just got
(0:44) reunited and on behalf of the all of the
(0:46) Wilsons of the world welcome home
(0:48) January 6ers it's guys like this that
(0:51) wanted to put you away in a hole in a
(0:53) dark hole absent due process and throw
(0:55) away the key these were not violent
(0:57) criminals by the way well hang on okay
(0:59) Andrew Andrew Andrew Andrew Andrew hang
(1:01) on let me just stop you there so I
(1:03) actually interviewed one of one of the
(1:05) protesters um Jacob who was the Qin on
(1:08) Shaman guy uh and I also had a capital
(1:11) uh police officer who'd been working
(1:12) that day and what they both agreed very
(1:16) interestingly was that they both
(1:18) condemned the violence against police
(1:19) officers that day so if if you can have
(1:22) one of the protesters who just been
(1:23) pardoned concede that the violence that
(1:26) was perpetrated by some of the
(1:27) protesters was wrong unacceptable and
(1:30) should be condemned why would you
(1:32) categorize it as as nonviolent well I
(1:36) didn't categorize it as nonviolent i
(1:37) said these are not violent criminals
(1:40) which is how it's being if you're
(1:41) perpetrating violence because
(1:43) what what how many a few a few a couple
(1:47) this guy on May 30th uh of 2020 with the
(1:51) White House was under siege it was
(1:53) attacked over a 100 Secret Service
(1:54) agents uh injured we had they were
(1:57) burning down stations this guy said "Oh
(2:00) well Trump had to go hide out in his
(2:02) bunker." Can you imagine if the roles
(2:05) were reversed and Donald Trump came out
(2:06) and was like "Oh AOC had to go hide oh
(2:08) these politicians had to go hide." He
(2:10) doesn't care about political violence
(2:12) the left doesn't care about political
(2:14) violence at all they'll use it when it's
(2:15) expedient for them they always do
(2:17) pointing to a couple of bad actors at
(2:19) this thing and saying all of them have
(2:21) to be thrown away and you know the key
(2:24) uh thrown away with them is insanity and
(2:26) no I I don't think so i think it's a
(2:28) miscatategorization to frame all of them
(2:31) as violent criminals and that's they
(2:33) weren't all violent at all i mean that's
(2:35) what he was doing that's what he was
(2:36) framing it though yeah no listen I I
(2:38) don't and change I do I do not agree
(2:40) with that i don't think all the 1500
(2:42) were violent in fact we know for a fact
(2:43) they weren't a lot of them are not
(2:46) violence
(2:48) yeah I didn't say that so look all right
(2:51) whatever dude uh so on the Young Turks
(2:54) we've been super clear about this and as
(2:56) always we're the one guys set people who
(2:59) are fair you'll see both sides do all
(3:02) this extreme stuff like Andrew is doing
(3:04) so first of all the people who went to
(3:05) the speech of Donald Trump a lot of
(3:07) times they get thrown into this uh and I
(3:10) have always said "No that's not fair
(3:11) they didn't go down to the capital." for
(3:12) the people who went to the capital uh
(3:14) it's an obvious crime to break into the
(3:16) capital and and why were they doing that
(3:19) they were trying to overturn the results
(3:20) of the election so you could blah blah
(3:22) blah on all your talking points but it's
(3:24) absurdity uh obviously they were trying
(3:26) to hurt our democracy they were trying
(3:29) to steal that election and were some of
(3:32) them violent were all of them violent no
(3:34) were some of them violent obviously we
(3:36) have eyes and ears so you can do all the
(3:39) propaganda you want but we just watch
(3:41) the tape of them trying to beat the crap
(3:42) out of the cops i thought you guys cared
(3:44) about cops i care about crime i'm
(3:47) against crime and you know and and we
(3:50) take heat sometimes from the left
(3:52) because they think that crime is a
(3:53) right-wing narrative and doesn't
(3:54) actually exist well the voters just
(3:56) showed you it does exist and they're
(3:57) pissed about it but they're also pissed
(3:59) about it when you go beat up cops for
(4:01) Trump so look I'm past it because the
(4:04) American people voted they put Trump
(4:06) back in office and and that's pretty
(4:08) definitive i didn't want that but it
(4:10) happened right but if you're going to
(4:12) try to do revisionist history that these
(4:14) were some patriots who showed up for a
(4:16) picnic but oh golly gee there was a
(4:18) capital so they started to bust in and
(4:20) beat the living crap out of the cops and
(4:22) oh he lost the election but oh no it was
(4:25) stolen so they go and try to do a coup
(4:27) attempt i hate it and I I think it's a
(4:30) terrible precedent and I think every
(4:32) time you guys defend it you sound absurd
(4:34) and it sounds like overwhelming
(4:36) ridiculous propaganda andrew yeah what
(4:39) it's about is a fair application of law
(4:41) and there has not been fair application
(4:43) of law here z himself cannot even do
(4:46) fair application of law at the same time
(4:48) he says "Oh tried to coup and overthrow
(4:50) the democracy." It's exactly what
(4:51) happened May 30th when they were
(4:53) attacking the White House they were
(4:54) attacking Secret Service agents they
(4:56) wanted to get in there and he all he
(4:58) could do was whine about how Trump had
(4:59) to get sent to a bunker where was his
(5:01) outrage about the coup d'etah where was
(5:03) he when Black Lives Matter was burning
(5:05) down cities
(5:07) he was protest he was saying instead I
(5:11) didn't interrupt you once do you think
(5:12) he calmed down for me so anyway uh
(5:14) what's going on very simply is that he
(5:17) has to revision his history while at the
(5:19) same time the Democrats are saying "You
(5:21) got to stay home and stay masked up."
(5:23) They're telling uh other people "Go
(5:25) outside burn down cities make Chaz Chop
(5:28) uh a nice free independent zone." I
(5:30) don't know how you could say that that's
(5:32) anything other than an insurrection to
(5:33) say that this is now no longer part of
(5:35) the United States government have your
(5:36) own armed militia there the entire nine
(5:38) yards May 30th they attack and this guy
(5:41) says nothing suddenly J6 though oh my
(5:44) god they're violent extremists they're
(5:45) going to overthrow democracy it's all
(5:48) nonsense it's not fair fairly applied
(5:50) he's never fairly applied it the laws
(5:52) has never been fairly applied to the
(5:54) J6ers they were tried in DC not in front
(5:56) of impartial uh juries and here's how
(5:58) our law works our law works like this a
(6:01) thousand walk free so one guilty person
(6:03) doesn't spend a day in prison that is
(6:05) the precedent for our law that's why
(6:06) they got pardoned and it's exactly why
(6:08) they should have my team had prepared
(6:11) some of your supposedly controversial
(6:14) inflammatory quotes about women and I've
(6:17) just read them and I'm thinking I think
(6:19) in the brave new world I don't find them
(6:22) that controversial
(6:23) so I'm just going to read one very one
(6:26) is the only reason feids hate my wife is
(6:28) because I tell her to get me a beer and
(6:30) she does that's the kind of thing I say
(6:32) to my wife and she laughs once she's
(6:34) made my dinner and then you say women
(6:38) can I ask you a question
(6:40) doesn't the beer taste better when your
(6:41) wife brings it to you absolutely
(6:44) absolutely and then you said this and
(6:45) Chen I'll be interested in whether you
(6:46) agree with this or not women find beds
(6:48) to be a centerpiece of decoration men
(6:50) find beds to be tools for sleeping it's
(6:52) so there's no purpose i mean I'm agree i
(6:54) agree chang beds he said he he said beds
(6:57) saying so like men when we look at beds
(6:59) we look at them as tools for sleeping in
(7:01) women's women actually look at them as
(7:02) decorations as well ch
(7:06) oh yeah i mean there's some truth to
(7:08) that of course not all women are the
(7:09) same not all men are the same but my mom
(7:11) would do curtains that didn't cover the
(7:13) windows at all because they looked great
(7:15) so here's my point here's my point
(7:17) exactly exactly you know what's
(7:18) interesting here's my point we've
(7:20) reached a point where Andrew Wilson's
(7:21) deeply inflammatory controversial quotes
(7:23) about women can actually now be laughed
(7:26) at in the tone that I believe they were
(7:28) originally expressed which is you know
(7:29) what just a bit of fun it doesn't matter
(7:32) women and men can tell little
(7:34) light-hearted jokes about each other
(7:36) playing up all kinds of stereotypes and
(7:38) it doesn't matter people don't need to
(7:40) be shamed canled vilified fired from
(7:43) their jobs we can actually have fun and
(7:47) then we can actually by doing that
(7:49) isolate the people who really deserve to
(7:52) be isolated who are despicable pieces of
(7:54) work so um Andrew great to have you back
(7:57) on Uncensored are are you remotely
(7:59) apprehensive about unleashing Mrs wilson
(8:03) on the world like this no um but she is
(8:07) the only Wilson on the panel that I
(8:08) claim i'm just just pointing it out
(8:12) everyone seems to be either called
(8:13) Wilson or Emily in this debate um in
(8:15) this two-header rachel welcome to
(8:17) Uncensored you reached out to me on X
(8:20) and and very boldly said "If you want to
(8:22) debate this properly get me on you're
(8:25) here how are you feeling about this?"
(8:28) Well thank you for having me Piers and
(8:30) thank you Andrew for unchaining me from
(8:32) the stove just long enough to appear
(8:34) today i got a day pass from the
(8:36) patriarchy patriarchy is benevolent
(8:39) it's so true yeah so I'm very happy to
(8:41) be here uh people love to attack my
(8:44) husband via me i'm I'm like the favorite
(8:46) way to do that so I thought why not come
(8:49) on and and talk to people myself so look
(8:52) Rachel let's let's cut to the quick a
(8:54) lot of Andrew's critics not me a lot of
(8:56) his critics say that he's an obvious
(8:59) blatant misogynist he thinks all women
(9:01) should be you know kept at home working
(9:04) away on the stove the housework whatever
(9:06) it may be uh and know their place in
(9:08) life you are actually married to him
(9:11) you've been subject to mockery
(9:14) inadvertently through the last debate we
(9:16) had about this for having to endure
(9:18) being his wife what is it like being
(9:20) married to Andrew Wilson
(9:23) well it's pretty awesome i mean he's
(9:25) hilarious he's really smart guy he's
(9:28) very charming and most of all he's a
(9:30) great dad and a great husband and I
(9:33) share his worldview so I I would agree
(9:35) in fact I would say I would probably be
(9:38) the more bitter misogynist out of the
(9:39) two of us if you really had to like pick
(9:41) one it would probably be me so really
(9:44) why do you say that i just think that
(9:46) feminism has absolutely destroyed so
(9:49) much of what I hold dear in life and
(9:51) it's held me back more than it's helped
(9:53) me it's one of the reasons I started
(9:55) looking into the history and
(9:56) investigating it for myself and I think
(9:59) it's just created a a a world where we
(10:02) now have a two-income economy and for
(10:04) women like me who do want to prioritize
(10:07) motherhood it makes it extremely hard it
(10:09) just makes it financially difficult i
(10:11) faced tons of social pressure had my
(10:14) first daughter at 20 wanted to stay home
(10:17) everyone around me even the so-called
(10:18) Christian conservative women told me it
(10:20) was a terrible idea you can't do that
(10:23) you have to bring the baby to daycare
(10:24) you're going to put yourself at risk you
(10:26) know the your husband's going to hurt
(10:28) you you're going to be abused if you
(10:30) don't have your own money and your own
(10:31) career and I think it's backwards i
(10:33) think it's the most inefficient stupid
(10:36) thing we've ever come up with and that
(10:38) in the future people will look back at
(10:40) the feminist experiment as a goofy time
(10:42) in history where we tried this wild
(10:45) experiment that failed miserably and
(10:47) thank God it's over wow okay well
(10:50) Clementine Ford I'm sure that you agree
(10:51) with every word of that don't you
(10:54) um firstly I'm very glad that you're
(10:56) happily married that's great you know a
(10:59) lot of women are not happily married and
(11:00) they find it very difficult to leave
(11:02) marriages particularly because of the
(11:04) financial strain so good for you um I do
(11:07) think that your historical understanding
(11:10) of feminism is extremely skewed the idea
(11:13) that somehow we have only created a
(11:15) two-income household because feminism
(11:17) has tried to destroy the world is
(11:18) historically inaccurate um in large part
(11:21) well firstly you're also talking about
(11:23) feminism from your very uh and when I
(11:26) say limited I'm not trying to insult you
(11:28) but the limited perspective of feminism
(11:30) in America and the understanding of the
(11:32) economy in America it's not taking into
(11:34) account the global reality of the fact
(11:37) that women have always worked women
(11:39) still continue to work women for the
(11:41) most part produce the majority of the
(11:43) world's underpaid if you know
(11:46) drastically underpaid labor um when you
(11:49) talk about a twoinome household being
(11:52) somehow instituted by feminism you're
(11:54) failing to take into account that even
(11:55) in America you know the the kind of the
(11:59) glamorization of this golden age of
(12:01) marriage in the 1950s to the early 1960s
(12:04) which the marriage historian Stephanie
(12:05) Coots calls the long decade this
(12:08) coincided with an increase in women in
(12:11) the workplace so it's not it's not as if
(12:14) there was this golden age where women
(12:15) weren't ma weren't where married women
(12:17) sorry weren't working
(12:21) for a lot of that actually the labor
(12:23) that is required to support the middle
(12:26) class is uh has always been relied on
(12:29) for poor and disenfranchised women
(12:31) largely in America black women start let
(12:35) me just let me just finish let me just
(12:37) finish we have to speed things up a
(12:38) little bit and the the economy the
(12:40) downturn in the economy the the boom
(12:42) that happened after the Second World War
(12:44) was unsustainable it was a wonderful
(12:46) time between around 1940 to 1970 for
(12:50) white working-class men in particular
(12:52) and then it began to I have a question
(12:54) for you one of the reasons why women had
(12:56) to go into the workforce was because
(12:58) they had to help women okay I have a
(13:01) question for you Clementine it's a very
(13:02) simple question but I think it'll be an
(13:04) interesting question to ask you what is
(13:06) a woman
(13:08) cheers i'm not going down the path of
(13:11) debating trans women with you trans
(13:13) women trans women i asked you what a
(13:15) woman is okay I'll tell you but I know
(13:16) that because this is your tactic this is
(13:18) what you do what is a woman i'll tell
(13:19) you shouldn't be controversial i'll tell
(13:22) you i'll tell you i'll tell you what a
(13:24) woman is a woman is someone who has at
(13:27) least at one point in her life felt
(13:30) scared of a man
(13:32) sorry so so you guys never want to talk
(13:35) about Wait hang on hang on you guys dumb
(13:37) thing I've ever heard so me any man
(13:38) who's ever felt afraid of another man as
(13:41) a woman no talking about what I'm saying
(13:44) you know this is exactly why you're
(13:46) wearing that shirt that says repeal you
(13:47) should put the 19th under it it's this
(13:50) unbelievable what are you talking about
(13:52) a woman any anybody who has ever at one
(13:55) point been afraid of a stupidest thing
(13:57) I've ever heard do you have an actual
(13:58) argument here would you let me finish
(14:01) speaking or How long is it going to take
(14:03) for you to finish how long is it going
(14:05) to take for you to finish yes do you
(14:07) really just invite people on your show
(14:08) to be interrupted like this make more
(14:11) money than their partners or their
(14:13) spouses tend to do more unpaid domestic
(14:15) labor this is the this is who did who
(14:17) did most who did most of the domestic
(14:20) chores
(14:22) in my house
(14:24) me you did me okay and Rachel who does
(14:27) most of them in your house that's the
(14:28) reality for Hang on hang on hang on
(14:30) rachel who does the Who does who does
(14:32) the domestic stuff in your house Rachel
(14:34) i do absolutely all of it and the thing
(14:37) I want to say to So you're very similar
(14:38) i mean you it seems to me you're both I
(14:40) care I care far less about women's
(14:43) fulfillment in careers than I care about
(14:45) children and how they're being raised
(14:46) and I want her to justify to me why we
(14:49) should be paying low-wage daycare
(14:52) workers to raise our children rather
(14:53) than doing it ourselves how does it make
(14:55) sense to take your duty of motherhood
(14:57) and simply put it on a different random
(15:00) woman how does that system make sense
(15:02) why should women if you would if you
(15:04) would like to stay at home and raise
(15:06) your children that's you're not
(15:07) answering you're not answering the
(15:09) question the question is for it's a
(15:12) question of choice to be raised by a
(15:13) question of choice it's actually not
(15:15) worse it's not worse for children to be
(15:18) raised by working mothers that is also
(15:21) the the the facts back that up there is
(15:23) no suggest
(15:26) listen
(15:28) that is not true no facts on planet
(15:30) Earth that back up that single mother
(15:32) households have better outcomes that's
(15:34) one two that outsourcing your specific
(15:37) let me finish
(15:40) you bring if you outsource the raising
(15:43) of your children you're already making
(15:44) yourself a single mother just so you
(15:46) know here's what's going on just that
(15:48) you understand outsourcing you a single
(15:50) father
(15:52) let me finish lady lady excuse me don't
(15:55) call me lady can you let me finish can
(15:57) anybody finish a point can anybody
(15:59) finish a point or only you have a point
(16:01) are only you allowed to i'm trying to
(16:03) make one so anyway
(16:05) if you outsource your children's raising
(16:08) to strangers answer Rachel's question
(16:11) and tell her how that makes more sense
(16:14) than having the child raised by their
(16:16) own biological mother actually answer
(16:21) "Well in my case it makes more sense
(16:23) because I need to make money to pay my
(16:25) bills to raise my child families
(16:28) it makes what if you depended on your
(16:30) husband's income do you see the problem
(16:33) of how we turn to finish now it's my
(16:36) turn to finish but actually again if you
(16:39) if you if you knew what you were talking
(16:42) about if you actually if you actually
(16:44) read anything about the the data on
(16:46) these things rather than just reaching
(16:48) into your gut well The Guardian summed
(16:50) up the general tone of the reporting
(16:51) with a headline that said from the
(16:52) police to the prime minister how
(16:54) adolescence is making Britain face up to
(16:56) toxic masculinity but is it really
(16:58) andrew Wilson let me start with you
(17:00) because I've got three sons uh 31 27 24
(17:05) uh I I think I brought them up to
(17:07) respect women to not behave in a
(17:09) misogynist way um and to behave in a
(17:12) pretty decent way generally um but I'm
(17:14) also aware that they've grown up in an
(17:16) era when the likes of Andrew Tate and
(17:19) others have become increasingly dominant
(17:22) in the way that a lot of impressionable
(17:24) young men start to think and view women
(17:27) and for all that Andrew Tate can say
(17:29) that is positive about getting fit and
(17:31) being successful and confident and so on
(17:34) there's indisputably
(17:36) a hardcore streak of misogyny that run
(17:39) through his veins which I think has been
(17:42) quite damaging to young men so I'm you
(17:45) know I'm not I'm not all in either way
(17:47) here but I can certainly see the
(17:48) arguments
(17:50) yeah well I mean I think that this this
(17:52) So I watched the show and it just goes
(17:55) through a a typical feminine view right
(17:57) so all of these things are always
(17:59) through the prism of the feminine so
(18:01) young boys they don't do well in school
(18:03) they don't do well in school because uh
(18:05) it's all programmed for the feminine uh
(18:07) stay still fold your hands right be
(18:10) quiet boys are rambunctious they like to
(18:11) beat each other up they like to be
(18:13) mischievous
(18:14) they like to uh break things they like
(18:16) to do that kind of stuff there's no
(18:18) outlet for them to do that stuff their
(18:20) teachers are all women right there's
(18:23) basically all masculinity is now
(18:25) considered toxic basically all of it the
(18:28) same women who are getting their double
(18:30) shot of espresso on the way over to uh
(18:33) the school they're about to teach at
(18:34) they're 24 years old sometimes they're
(18:36) banging their own students right
(18:38) hilariously enough and then these people
(18:40) go out to Parliament the same women who
(18:42) go to Parliament they vote to send men
(18:44) off to war to stab each other in the
(18:46) face with bayonets and you're concerned
(18:49) about toxic masculinity it cracks me up
(18:52) it's like the brutal savagery of men is
(18:54) a necessary precondition for society to
(18:57) exist and we just kind of pretend like
(18:59) it's not and this show should actually
(19:02) be an indictment on the feminine rather
(19:04) than the masculine because basically
(19:07) masculinity is just punished everywhere
(19:09) all the time non-stop it's no wonder
(19:11) guys like Andrew Tate uh get so famous
(19:13) in these spaces uh uh I mean what's the
(19:17) alternative the alternative is
(19:18) everything must be feminine tone
(19:20) policing nonsense like this it's
(19:22) ridiculous all right James Bar you were
(19:24) laughing but I don't think I don't think
(19:25) you'll enjoy what you're hearing no I
(19:27) mean that's you I don't think you've
(19:29) seen the show episode two is shot
(19:31) entirely in a school i didn't see one of
(19:33) the female teachers drinking a double
(19:35) shot of espresso at all none of the
(19:37) teachers were flirting with students
(19:39) there were male teachers as well i don't
(19:41) think you're describing the show here i
(19:42) think you're describing your own
(19:43) insecurities or agenda
(19:46) yeah so this doesn't contend with the
(19:48) argument like do you understand that I'm
(19:50) making an argument indictment of society
(19:52) itself based around my ideas that I'm
(19:55) I'm seeing from this show that's what
(19:57) I'm actually doing so if you could
(19:58) contend with the fact that male savagery
(20:00) is necessary for the security of a
(20:02) nation and that women will indeed vote
(20:04) in the future in parliaments to send men
(20:06) off to war to stab each other in the
(20:08) face at 18 years old with bayonets
(20:10) perhaps you can contend with that before
(20:12) we start u you know getting into well
(20:15) tell policing is actually good and uh
(20:17) toxic masculinity is actually bad it's
(20:20) like I think there needs to be a little
(20:21) bit more toxic masculinity or what you
(20:23) consider to be toxic masculinity
(20:27) well great i'm glad you think so nothing
(20:30) i mean I just don't need to argue with
(20:31) that because you just stun locked you
(20:33) just stun locked you got nothing
(20:36) you're you're making up you do seem
(20:38) unusually
(20:39) I've not said anything i haven't
(20:41) literally said nothing about you were
(20:43) literally rendered silent you're nowhere
(20:45) i'll tell you why you can't argue with a
(20:47) completely illogical argument that had
(20:48) like I've not made any It's a logical
(20:50) argument you may not agree with it i
(20:52) haven't made any perfectly logical
(20:54) argument that you were firing at me none
(20:55) of those comments are things I've said
(20:57) or believe in all right I want to bring
(20:59) Tommy in because Tommy you've got a very
(21:00) interesting perspective there i think
(21:02) you've talked about something different
(21:03) you call it the pussification of men
(21:06) which is a great phrase i'd love you to
(21:08) just explain what you mean by that but
(21:10) also you're not a fan of Andrew Tate all
(21:12) the influence he has so that's makes you
(21:14) I think an interesting commentator in
(21:16) this area so just explain first of all
(21:18) the pussification of men
(21:23) all right Pierce well I think and I
(21:25) can't see you all so forgive me if I'm
(21:26) incorrect here but I think I'm I'm the
(21:28) only female on this panel so I'm really
(21:31) anxious to weigh in okay so I think over
(21:34) the last probably 10 years there has
(21:36) been what I call the pussification of
(21:38) men it was everything should be about
(21:40) your emotions and your feelings and men
(21:43) were emasculated and this whole concept
(21:45) of toxic masculinity warped the minds of
(21:48) a lot of young men and they felt
(21:50) masculine they wanted to be masculine
(21:52) but society was telling them they should
(21:53) be softer that it was being toxically
(21:56) masculine if you wanted to play sports
(21:58) and chop wood and go to war and so men
(22:01) were so emasculated and so beat down
(22:04) that then there was this revolution of
(22:07) what was actually toxic masculinity the
(22:10) Tate brothers and others which I feel as
(22:12) a female that that doesn't represent
(22:14) true masculinity that to me represents
(22:17) douchebaggery and as a woman I want a
(22:19) strong man who is a protector and a
(22:21) provider that will go to war if need be
(22:24) that will protect me protect my family
(22:26) make money i see that as being actually
(22:29) masculine that's like the man that I
(22:30) grew up with my dad but what we're
(22:32) seeing now is these young men who look
(22:35) at Andrew Tate and the Tate brothers and
(22:37) they see somebody who's just quite
(22:39) frankly a douchebag and disrespects
(22:40) women and because they've been so
(22:42) emasculated they're like "Oh great
(22:44) that's a manly man." But that's not
(22:46) right either so at some point I think
(22:48) we'll go back to maybe meeting in the
(22:50) middle here you can be a man who has
(22:52) feelings and emotions but you can also
(22:55) go to war and protect and defend your
(22:56) family i'm hoping we can get back there
(22:59) but the two extremes right now they're
(23:01) confusing men and quite frankly they're
(23:03) leaving women with few choices and
(23:06) that's the real tragedy here you see I
(23:08) completely agree with you but Andrew you
(23:10) were shaking your head quite vigorously
(23:12) why yeah yeah well I mean it's just more
(23:14) feminine or feminist nonsense ultimately
(23:17) and the covert feminism in society is
(23:20) big especially on the conservative side
(23:22) so here's here's what happens right
(23:24) women need to have feminine virtues for
(23:27) men to be pursuing masculine virtues for
(23:29) you to say things like "Well men what I
(23:32) want is for men to protect me and I want
(23:34) men to make money." Well that's great
(23:35) what that ends up doing is it gives you
(23:37) a set of privilege in society what do
(23:40) men get what do men get for doing that
(23:43) for you what are we getting from women
(23:45) for doing that are we getting chased
(23:46) virgins on our wedding night no we're
(23:48) not getting chased virgins on our
(23:50) wedding night are we getting women of
(23:52) great virtue no we're not getting women
(23:54) of great virtue the idea of courtly love
(23:56) is supposed to be done for women of
(23:59) great virtue where are they well they're
(24:01) nowhere and so in modernity in society
(24:03) when conservative influencer female
(24:05) conservative influencers say this it's
(24:07) actually a form of covert se feminism
(24:09) and they're saying "I want privilege in
(24:10) society right?" But what is it women are
(24:13) giving to men to get it what What are
(24:15) they giving them tell me
(24:19) can I please chime in here yes you can
(24:21) and then then James can and I'll come to
(24:23) you Sean no I would love to i love this
(24:26) whole thing of like if you're a female
(24:28) conservative and you don't believe that
(24:30) men should be douchebags that all of a
(24:32) sudden you're a covert feminist call me
(24:34) a feminist i really don't give one crap
(24:37) one way or another but I can tell you
(24:38) this a lot of these men these podcast
(24:40) hosts on the right that like to think of
(24:42) themselves of these big masculine men
(24:44) and what am I getting out of it i can
(24:46) tell you this there's that feminism i
(24:48) believe I'm a woman feminism coming out
(24:50) yeah there's the feminism oh and then
(24:52) and then you're interrupting me to take
(24:54) long
(24:55) did it okay
(24:58) oh I'm sorry did you want to speak over
(24:59) a man i don't care if you call me I
(25:01) don't really care if you call me a
(25:02) strong independent woman yeah yeah yeah
(25:06) you're actually interrupting me i didn't
(25:07) interrupt you when you were spewing your
(25:09) [ __ ] so now it's my turn okay you
(25:11) mean you mean the truth like I said
(25:13) before so I believe I'm a There we go
(25:15) again pierce I'm a woman of virtue i
(25:18) happen to be independently successful i
(25:20) have a husband who's not only a former
(25:22) professional athlete but is currently a
(25:24) professional baseball coach so is he not
(25:26) a masculine man i mean I'm confused here
(25:29) what's your concept
(25:31) mine is a man who respects me yeah that
(25:34) misses the point though like you're
(25:35) still not contending with the argument
(25:37) i'm saying inside of society right this
(25:39) second right masculinity is not only
(25:41) punished but also women on the right
(25:44) covert feminists on the right are
(25:45) constantly and consistently talking
(25:47) about how they need to have privilege in
(25:48) society I want men their version of
(25:51) masculinity is men who take care of us
(25:53) men who protect us men who do all of
(25:55) this are all duties that men have
(25:57) towards women great what are the duties
(25:59) that women have towards men what are the
(26:01) duties that women have towards anything
(26:04) what do men get out of this arrangement
(26:06) What are we getting out of this
(26:07) arrangement can you tell me i mean you
(26:10) would argue that menately should I
(26:12) interrupt you hang on one second let
(26:14) Tommy resp let Tommy respond to that and
(26:16) then I'll come to you J then Sean you've
(26:18) been waiting patiently so most men are
(26:19) born to be protectors and providers i
(26:22) can't imagine my dad saying you know
(26:25) what to my mom you know what i'm not
(26:27) going to be a protector and a provider
(26:28) unless you do this that's not how real
(26:31) men operate real men are protectors and
(26:34) providers and they marry women who
(26:36) hopefully have a woman but also bring a
(26:38) lot to the table as well that are great
(26:40) mothers great wives caretakers of the
(26:42) home there's nothing wrong with being a
(26:44) traditional wife and mother you're
(26:46) misunderstanding me if you think that I
(26:48) think that women should just be out
(26:49) doing whatever they want i think that
(26:51) there are gender roles
(26:53) but I don't think a man needs to get
(26:55) something out of it to be a manly man a
(26:58) protector and a provider if you think
(27:00) you need to get something out of it I
(27:02) quite frankly don't consider you a real
(27:03) man yeah she have nothing but we'll
(27:06) discuss in a moment whether Angel Wilson
(27:08) is a real man i offer nothing i offer
(27:11) nothing
(27:13) you offer me a couple of things Tommy
(27:15) it's why I always love having you on the
(27:17) show you know that um let's go to a real
(27:19) man James Bar thank you i do see myself
(27:21) as a man and I know that you'll be
(27:23) looking at me thinking well you're not
(27:25) you're wearing makeup you're wearing
(27:26) colorful clothes like look at me i
(27:28) really can my nails are painful they are
(27:30) worried you're sat there smoking a
(27:32) cigarette i'd love to get a vape out and
(27:34) start drinking a beer you know pints
(27:36) with the lads just connect with you over
(27:37) that i I think that you have some insane
(27:39) opinions on what women are meant to do
(27:42) for you it's crazy that you don't
(27:44) appreciate that a woman actually gave
(27:45) birth to you like she gave you a womb
(27:48) for 9 months and then looked after you I
(27:50) would hope for the for the beginning of
(27:52) your life and you're sat there going
(27:53) "What do women owe men?" Women don't owe
(27:55) men anything no one owes you anything
(27:59) you have your own life do you understand
(28:00) that if you make an argument and you say
(28:03) that women are supposed on how to win an
(28:05) argument in a position if that women are
(28:07) supposed to be in a position of
(28:08) privilege where men do A B C and D for
(28:10) them and then I ask well what duties do
(28:12) women have and you say well nothing and
(28:14) then you wonder why are men checking out
(28:16) i don't know why men are checking out i
(28:17) don't get it you just silly man let me
(28:20) bring all
