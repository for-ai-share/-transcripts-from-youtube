(6:15) this fine evening as we square off on this topic we appreciate all of you coming out for this very Lively and what
(6:23) is sure to be a spirited debate where of course your host wins just on looks alone and Charisma but um you know I
(6:32) digress let me turn it over to Jacob Jacob why don't you take a minute introduce yourself tell everybody where they can find you briefly a little bit
(6:38) about yourself yeah well of course thanks for having me Andrew I greatly appreciate it so yeah my name is Jacob winegrad I am
(6:45) the host of the biblical Anarchy podcast which is a project of the libertarian Christian Institute I've been there for
(6:52) a couple years now after podcasting on my own for a little bit and uh yeah I mean I think it's pretty
(6:58) self-explanatory I content mainly on politics current events philosophy theology from a
(7:04) Christian perspective which I think uh leads to libertarianism but that's partly what we're here to debate about
(7:10) tonight so uh yeah I think that's good enough for an introduction and then Kyle moderator coming out tonight we The
(7:16) Crucible thanks you for doing that in such short notice very kind to you why don't you do the same thing shout out your channel briefly tell the audience a
(7:23) little bit about yourself uh I am Kyle from the two tongues podcast uh me and my buddy Chris
(7:30) talk about you know current events politics things like that I just did an
(7:35) episode last night at premiered um with two Orthodox guys defending Orthodoxy uh
(7:42) against two Lutheran guys who are very critical of it I think uh I think you guys might be interested in that so go
(7:48) ahead and give that a check out all right appreciate that very much the Shameless Shilling of your channel is a
(7:55) must here on The Crucible uh so with that I'm going to take off the host cap
(8:01) and send it over to the moderator we agreed in the back Jacob is going to open he is the Challenger here uh most
(8:08) of my opening statements going to be set to a response to whatever his criticisms are and then we'll move into the back and forth debate remember for those of
(8:14) you just joining we'll be taking on callers tonight we expect a full house make sure you get in the call queue early if you want to call in on this
(8:22) debate we'll be reading all super chats as well and with that let's get to
(8:27) it all right all right I'll set your timer for seven minutes Jacob uh go
(8:34) ahead whenever you're ready Cool all right so I have two main criticisms I want to level towards Andrew first is
(8:40) related to marriage so first I want to define marriage Genesis we are told therefore a man shall leave his father
(8:46) and his mother and hold fast to his wife and they shall become one flesh also we are told they they are told to be
(8:52) fruitful and multiply and these commands are given universally and never later change to only be applied to Christians
(8:59) so God's natural order is for men and women to join together and have families now is there a distinction between being
(9:06) married outside the body of Christ for sure being brought into communion with Christ impacts all areas of our life
(9:12) including marriage churches have authority to oversee and enforce biblical standards and to use discipline
(9:18) on the members of their church this doesn't nullify secular marriages but it's an enhancement and and bolster on
(9:24) the on the part of Christian marriages now I agree with Andrew that it is in our best interest to divorce marriage
(9:31) from the state we have different reasons for that where I disagree fundamentally with Andrew though is in his
(9:36) characterization of secular unions that are adhering to the proper structure of one man and one woman as being
(9:43) degenerate and therefore not things that Christians should promote Andrew used the term degeneracy light in his debate
(9:49) with Lauren Chen to describe her case that we as Christians should still encourage secular people to enter into
(9:56) monogamous heterosexual unions or marriages B on evaluating the different outcomes even if Andrew is right that
(10:03) secular marriages aren't quote real marriages I would hesitate to call this consequentialism as Lauren did
(10:09) consequentialism is a theory of normative ethics that states that the moral value of an action should be judged based on its consequences well we
(10:16) agree from the Christian world view that that's wrong and we instead dictate that what is moral is grounded in the essence
(10:22) of God and his revealed moral decrees given through the word and the church an action is judged as good based on
(10:29) obedience to God using reason to apply what God has prescribed so the question we have to ask as Christians is what has
(10:35) God prescribed instructed us to do regarding marriage and relationships between non-believers the underlying
(10:41) question being what is prescribed for non-christians as Andrew and I would agree on the prescription for Christians
(10:47) and the ultimate prescription is for the unsaved to become saved and then submit to Christ in the teachings of Christ
(10:53) through the church but then is there nothing prescribed to those who have not yet been saved nothing prescribed to
(10:59) those who were on the path but not there yet and nothing prescribed to Christians to facilitate the drawing of more into
(11:05) the kingdom and the rule of Christ on Earth no I would say we are prescribed by scripture and by the church fathers
(11:11) and traditions to offer Solutions use influence and Lead Society in the ways of Christ even when they have not yet
(11:17) been born again into God's kingdom the cultural mandate of Genesis 1 be fruitful and multiply fill the Earth and
(11:23) subdue it have dominion over every living thing that moves on the earth this means at minimum we should instruct
(11:29) all to live according to Christian norms and ethics which are creational norms and ethics some would call this natural law
(11:35) it's objectively built into creation itself even if they aren't yet Christian the choice here is whether we encourage
(11:42) people to follow the natural order or not follow it if we encourage them to follow it even if they do so imperfectly
(11:48) then the response is to continue to promote them to move closer to the Natural order and to come to Christ
(11:54) ultimately who will sanctify them and their relationships and church fathers and the iians there's many I could quote
(12:00) from I'm going to start with two just for the opening statement to support this as well Justin Martyr said Endeavor
(12:06) to persuade those who hate us unjustly to live conformably to the good precepts
(12:11) of Christ to the end that they may become partakers with us of the same joyful hope of a reward from God the
(12:16) ruler of all and then St John of konat who's a Russian Eastern Orthodox artch priest from the 18th century said by
(12:23) loving our neighbor we imitate God we show ourselves to be children of God and thus we are able to influence others
(12:29) positively part of loving our neighbor is drawing them into the ethos of Christianity including seeking the goods
(12:35) of the Christian worldview which can be used by God to draw individuals and promote virtue and Society through the
(12:41) church we can dive more into this when we get to the back and forth but let me quickly level my second criticism I
(12:46) agree with a lot of Andrew's descriptions and even some of his prescriptions when it comes to politics but where the disagreement comes
(12:53) fundamentally is in the defining of the morally normative use of force by the standards of Christian ethics Authority
(12:59) isn't inherently bad and the Bible does prescribe different types of authority all authority including civil comes from
(13:06) God but that Authority is given only to do what is specifically prescribed and any deviation from that would be a
(13:12) misuse of the authority God has granted the civil magistrate is prescribed to wield the sword against those who do
(13:17) evil in the Civil context meaning the enforcement of property rights and the obligation against initiating violence
(13:24) this is understood because of the principle of Lex tonus or just retribution as established in Genesis 9
(13:30) which was also clearly present as part of the Mosaic civil law that it operates differently in the Mosaic Covenant the
(13:36) Mosaic Covenant also included other laws and Norms ceremonial laws and such and specific commands which ended during
(13:43) ended when that Covenant ended being fulfilled and superseded by the New Covenant in Christ the true offspring of
(13:49) Abraham outside of the temporary Mosaic Covenant civil governance is only prescribed to enforce Civil Justice this
(13:56) is a crucial component of my argument that libertarian ism is the consistent conclusion of Christian ethics it's not
(14:02) a rejection of authority it's a rejection of unjust Authority 1 Samuel 8 depict God's warning to Israel that the
(14:09) king will rob from them and from God make them his slaves in order for government to be Christian it must not
(14:15) violate God's moral decrees as government is just individual people with authority Thou shalt not steal Thou
(14:21) shalt not murder these don't have exceptions you can justify or uh use Force to um sorry you can justify uh the
(14:29) use of force to uphold property rights and to respond to violence you cannot justly initiate or use Force to regulate
(14:34) or prevent all sinful behavior and those who try end up straying from Christian ethics uh if okay good one minute if
(14:41) they are if they aren't banning all sinful Behavior then they have no consistent standard for which
(14:47) non-violent sins should be legal and which shouldn't be theists and the like will try to appeal to the Mosaic civil
(14:54) code but that was for a specific people specific time and that Covenant purpose was to bring about the Christ we see in
(15:01) ancient Israel's case and in all of human history that attempting to use Force to deal with the problem of sin
(15:07) does not work and does not work to create a Godly society and those are the two fundamental disagreements that I
(15:15) have all right uh if that finishes up for you we'll uh set the seven minutes for Andrew you can get started whenever
(15:22) you're ready sure so I'm going to be a little bit more brief uh as I think I can kind of get at most of these
(15:29) criticisms quickly as again my opening statement is going to be used to defend against the criticisms rather than um my
(15:37) positions in general so I did not know which ones he was going to attack so we'll start with marriage we are told
(15:42) the definition in Genesis I agree however I would say that these have been even further clarified by Church
(15:48) teachings also by the New Testament nullification of Secor marriage promotion of such is degenerate and I'm
(15:56) going to double down triple down on this and let me explain why first of all degeneracy means without morals he's
(16:03) already created another category he says there's a category of marriage that's Christian marriage and there's another
(16:09) category which is not Christian marriage is that category less moral he's going
(16:14) to have TR actually a struggle answering this question every they all have a struggle answering this question is this
(16:20) other category less moral in order for us to say that we recognize this as being equal he's going to have to say
(16:26) that they're equal in Morality he's not going to be able to do that so it's it's actually not possible for him to do he's
(16:31) going to say this other category is not the fullness of marriage he'll use every word he can possibly make except to say
(16:39) that it's less moral but it has to be otherwise why would it be in another category makes no sense uh but
(16:45) capitalizing on that uh just so you understand in the context of that debate we're talking about secular marriage in
(16:51) the United States and this is State marriage which is a promotion of what I consider to be inversion state marage
(16:58) marriage is an actual inversion of Christian marriage and let me explain how first of all you take the head of
(17:04) the church out and you instead make the head the state that's problem number one
(17:11) secondly you give the wife egalitarianism and incentives to destroy the marriage from the state who is the
(17:18) head and promoting egalitarianism inside of marriage itself is an inversion of
(17:25) the man being the head the representation the of the head of the church and the woman the body who the
(17:31) man is the head of because it's an inversion the sign of the satanic the sign of um anything which is satanic is
(17:40) always what is inverted that's how you can generally tell tons of church teachings on this as well for how you
(17:46) can spot inversion I don't even think my opponent would disagree that this is
(17:51) true for those who are prescribed marriage in a non-Christian Union uh I would say that this is an overarching
(17:58) bad and so does my opponent so I don't know what he's going to end up fighting me
(18:04) about uh natural law also he references that totally made up it's a madeup category that it's not a thing he can
(18:11) demonstrate I'm happy to get into that with him as well secular marriage uh or I'm sorry moving on to the second
(18:16) criticism for the purpose of time constraints uh he says politically defining the use of force in Christian
(18:23) ethics is bad no it's not bad that's uh that's actually a silly argument doesn't make any sense and here's how I can
(18:30) demonstrate how much of his actual position here with this libertarianism is nonsense because as he says that he
(18:37) can prescribe this law um and that there's going to be some civil enforcement of law we're going to end up
(18:44) in something which is arbitrary and here's an example he says that we must utilize
(18:50) enforcement of property rights that's what he claims is kind of the the
(18:55) overarching uh worldview uh at least from his perspective the core of his perspective is property rights
(19:02) enforcement uh but what gives somebody the right to own property what actually
(19:08) gives somebody the right to own land how do we know that they own the land what
(19:13) gives them right to it I would love to know the answer to that question and we're going to dive into that as well uh
(19:20) of course you can use Force to regulate Behavior we've been doing it since the dawn of time we're going to continue to do it I really don't see how he's going
(19:26) to argue against that either he says that attempt to use Force to enforce morality or Christian ethics doesn't
(19:32) work of course it works we've seen that a 100 times as well so with that I'm happy to yield the rest of my time and
(19:39) dive right into this debate all right uh with both of the opening statements done we are going to
(19:45) go ahead and move into the back and forth uh I'm going to set my timer for that and you guys uh just go ahead and
(19:51) get after it whenever you're ready so uh Jacob let me uh let me ask you a
(19:57) question let us assume for a moment that um you crash on an island in the middle
(20:06) of the Uncharted sea and it's a large island and it's you and your wife very
(20:11) large island in fact let's say it's multiple miles across but no country holds claim to this island no country
(20:20) does and you land there on this island with your wife and you start to uh have
(20:25) children and you begin to populate this island would you say that the island is then
(20:31) your property um I I would hold to the idea
(20:37) that to justly own property means that you have to Homestead it and so to Homestead Property means that you have
(20:43) to have made some kind of you know visible change to to to the land you know mixed your labor with it in some
(20:49) sense although that's a clumsy analogy uh I mean there's also the idea that in a legal theory that it's Whoever has the
(20:55) just you know whoever has the best claim to it so I mean if you're the only what does that mean Jacob what does it mean
(21:02) you say you say they can Homestead it therefore that makes it theirs why why
(21:07) does that instantly make it theirs because they can Homestead it or they have done some improvement to it why
(21:14) well I mean we know that property can be owned based on biblical principles uh
(21:19) the Bible upholds property rights even just from the Commandment do not steal you can't have theft without property um
(21:26) so then we're talking I need to Define how we're going to be able to ascertain who owns the property right so uh it
(21:33) comes down so people will recognize claims of other people's property generally and then if there's a dispute
(21:39) over that property then you do need something like civil magistrates or third party arbitration to uh if it
(21:46) comes down to it yeah that's all Force yeah I mean I don't think all you're doing is making the argument that
(21:52) property rights are Force the second property is disputed what happens Jacob
(21:59) yeah I I don't think that my position is that we can't use I think my my opening statement I said we can use Force to
(22:05) uphold property well now there's no can use right there say if there's any dispute property we're we're morally
(22:11) obligated to use Force to protect property rights are well I mean are we though because when you're when you're inside of a dispute like this right it
(22:18) really does just come down to whoever has the most Force owns the property actually right well no now now you're
(22:25) getting down into uh descriptive versus prescriptive yes it is true in a descriptive sense that Mike m Mike makes
(22:32) right to to some degree in the world that we live in uh but in terms of from the Christian worldview of what is uh
(22:38) prescribed in ter in terms of God's moral decrees uh we we could say well you know yeah if a I mean if a big
(22:45) country invades a small one and takes all their land and stuff like that happened that happens all the time right so let's start with um so let's start
(22:52) with this then so that we don't go too far into the weeds we'll just kind of narrow narrow and hone down in on this
(22:58) so starting with property rights itself you say descriptively you agree with me that it is force descriptively but that
(23:05) does not mean that we ought to use force it just means that descriptively it does come down to force right yeah I mean you
(23:11) know go going off biblical principles we're told to try to live at peace with others as far as it depends on us so we
(23:16) should you know relegate as Christians forc to being like the last option that we would uh use to protect our property
(23:23) but yeah there's ultimately many situations where to you know to uh uphold that prop right uh is going to
(23:29) require Force no then let me ask you how you would resolve this matter as a Christian a person has
(23:36) cross-generational family land and they have um water which goes through that
(23:42) land that water which goes through the land is used as a trade hub on a later built town on the coast which people
(23:49) depend upon he blocks that off because it's technically on his land right who
(23:56) here should imminent domain take effect and his land be seized or should he have
(24:01) the right to block it off at the expense of everybody else in the town down from
(24:07) the river um yeah that's that's a good question uh I think a lot of
(24:14) Libertarians come up with different answers for this some people try to say that there should be some kind of uh easement for things like that other
(24:20) people say that water or like natural resources like that um shouldn't be you know things that people should be
(24:27) morally uh uh encouraged to to own or use stuff
(24:33) like that it's it's important to note that this while this is a real issue that there's not a perfect solution for
(24:38) from a Libertarian worldview I don't think that there's a perfect solution from the uh from a state world view
(24:45) either because uh corporations can still do this and do environmental damage all the time and they just pay off
(24:51) politicians and law enforcement and pass regulations to get away with their various there is a perfect solution from
(24:58) a uh corporate perspective or state perspective they go in with guns and they unblock it they arrest him and they
(25:04) throw him in prison and that's the end of it it's a perfect solution yeah well I I think what Libertarians would say is that rather than uh you know relying on
(25:12) on Force which there might again there are some Libertarians who say that there can be Force used in that sort of
(25:18) instance but that rather what they would try to uh encourage in a a more libertarian legal order society would be
(25:26) contract law and and things like that which would You' have Market forces incentivizing against people doing that
(25:33) so you would set up a system that but he just doesn't want to Jacob he just really doesn't he doesn't want to play
(25:39) ball Jacob he doesn't want to and it's his [ __ ] he has the cross generational
(25:44) claim as you just said he's been homesteading the land it's his Jacob it's his land he can he just do that
(25:52) can't he uh if if there's water running
(25:57) through his land and he's really like homesteaded everything around the land um yeah you could construct a scenario
(26:03) where there was no contract I mean listen prevention is always better than cure and I think that a Libertarian free
(26:09) market Society does better in preventing these problems than the state does and again you can say there's a perfect
(26:15) solution of we take men with guns and go in there but that's wait wait that solution works every single time doesn't
(26:21) it except that it doesn't get in practice again if you're saying practice it seems to work better than anything
(26:27) that you've proposed in practice in fact every single situation that I States and governments are like the biggest
(26:33) polluters of the in the world yeah maybe maybe so but when it comes down to uh enforcement of whatever policy is they
(26:40) seem to be able to enforce it fine so you can argue that they make some stupid policies sure everybody makes stupid
(26:46) policies libertarian governments would make stupid policies and have made stupid policies I'm But ultimately what
(26:52) I'm saying to you is is that yes the state is quite effective at just going
(26:57) in with guns saying no unblock this Waterway and the residents down there are now going to get the goods and
(27:03) services that they need on this Waterway they seize it via imminent domain and Jacob that seems like it's optimal to me
(27:10) that seems like a way more optimal system than we come up with a bunch of bizarre Nuance contract nonsense you
(27:16) can't actually expedient expedent I don't it's necessarily I need to hear the argument for why it's more
(27:23) imoral uh well I think that you have to have a a a large
(27:28) view a lower time preference of evaluating these situations because when we create centralized institutions of
(27:35) power uh yeah there might be immediate payoffs and and and things that you
(27:40) would count on the good side of The Ledger but over a long period of time what are the trade-offs right I mean I kind of take that Thomas Soul approach
(27:47) to politics and I'm not a Libertarian absolutist although I uh like the video you were listening two of me from a
(27:53) couple years ago today when your debate prep uh back then I was probably more of a in my my my libertarian cage stage
(27:59) like I was full like you know Roth rothbard this and uh haak that and all
(28:06) that and I try to take more of a pragmatic view uh at this point in my political Theory uh I think listen we
(28:13) would I think both agree that neither of our views are going to create a Utopia that prevent some sort of problems but
(28:18) if I think not trying to say that mine does I'm trying to say that my view though is superior well I would I know
(28:24) that's what if we're talking about tradeoffs which I Thomas Soul quote that there are no Solutions only tradeoffs I
(28:31) think the tradeoffs of a Libertarian legal order are far preferable to the trade-offs of a yeah that's nice but I
(28:38) need to hear a moral argument for why it is that the government shouldn't just come in shouldn't just unblock it
(28:45) shouldn't just let the water all right I'll give you an answer if we create a monopoly of force so powerful that it
(28:52) can make decisions like that against people's property then the tradeoffs of that or what we see around us we see
(28:59) that that free markets are completely destroyed and subverted we've created an institution now you're reversing
(29:04) descriptive and prescriptive again you're saying because it is this way then that prescriptively means that it
(29:09) shouldn't be that way that makes no sense you're saying that if we create a monopoly on force with some type of
(29:15) entity that that means they have to then use it to be oppressive it doesn't seem that way to me it seems like you could
(29:21) have an absolute Force Monopoly that only did good things right I mean and
(29:27) and sure theoretically sure so the thing is is that if we could also say I could
(29:32) also say in my theoretical libertopia that everyone just contractually agrees to not so I mean like we can both say
(29:39) well this doesn't have to go bad but we could just look empirically and say most of the time uh when we centralize power
(29:46) this is what happens no it doesn't seem to go bad when you centralize power in fact it seems to go bad when you
(29:52) polarize populations rather than having something which is a central theme inside the population in fact I would
(29:58) say that if your population has a single religion that is monopolistic that your society's better
(30:05) I would say that if your Society is homogeneous and monopolistic that way that it's better I would say that
(30:12) diversity is not a strength I would say that having these kind of core buildup of powers is a good thing
(30:19) Jacob yeah again I I think empirically let's look at here at America right we started out as a constitutional republic
(30:25) we were very small very decentralized in terms of of the government as that is grown things that you and I
(30:31) care about right like having like I think you and I would be uh fellow Travelers when it comes to wanting to see an increase of of chist Christianity
(30:40) in our society we see that as you wouldn't want some Monopoly like that they'd have the Monopoly on Force Jacob
(30:46) well I'm I'm I'm talking culturally spiritually and yeah but they would then Christians would have a monopoly on
(30:51) Force you don't want that they didn't Christians didn't have a monopoly enforce you're talking about in in the
(30:58) uh I mean yes majority let me was a majority of
(31:04) Christians when America was founded so yes the the institution of force that did exist was by Christians right but
(31:11) but they didn't have this giant centralized power right I'm not using he wait wait what do you mean they didn't
(31:18) the president of who's the commander-in chief of the United States armed forces from the Inception of our nation Jacob
(31:23) right it was the it was the president it's the president of the United States he is in full of the entire armed forces of America
(31:31) who are all Christians centralized authority over all of the Jacob Jacob
(31:36) wait wait over all of the force of the United States one guy held the keys one right right and the Anti-Federalists
(31:43) were right we should have never signed the Constitution but that's that's a whole other different Rabbit Hole uh compared to what right so yes in the
(31:50) abstract that's still more government than I want uh but compared to a lot of the governments that that existed around
(31:56) that time compared to the government we have today it was much smaller much more decentralized yeah that's cuz there
(32:02) wasn't as many people first of all there wasn't as many people we were living on in basically coastal areas because
(32:09) people settle where there's water okay that's that's why there wasn't very many people most of this landmass had not
(32:15) been conquered at that point that's why you had a smaller government but as far as representation goes right no there
(32:23) was really quite a bit of bureaucracy which was going on uh during not only the founding of the nation but during
(32:28) the 13 colonies there was bureaucracy all over the place the government was absolutely stuffed to the brim with
(32:34) bureaucrats in fact and you had state religions on top of that every single colony had a state religion and then
(32:42) post constitutional ratification they still had state religions it was bureaucracy on top of bureaucracy I
(32:49) don't know how you can say that this was some libertarian e it wasn't in fact the very one of the first things he did was
(32:55) the Whiskey Rebellion right very first thing they did was they went ahead and they grabbed the militia and used force
(33:02) in order to make sure that people were paying their taxes like they were supposed to very first thing they did
(33:08) we've always had a monopoly on Force the United States arguably it's always worked extremely well as long as you
(33:14) have moral people who are in the positions of power sure if you have moral people that helps but how long
(33:20) does that last and I would say that the American experiment where it went wrong was it centralized power too much now a
(33:26) Christian majority was able to keep that power relatively in check for a time but I would say and this was part of what I
(33:33) got into in my response video to you was that I think the problem is that when you centralize power too much what
(33:39) inevitably happens is that the incentive structure of that centralized power is going to work against Christianity it's
(33:45) actually going to subvert the church and Christian institutions and I think that's exactly what has happened in in
(33:52) our country in our in our society pism uh listen I I'm hang on would be
(33:59) the hang on what would be the central Authority self-loathing Protestant yeah what would be the authority the
(34:05) self-governing authority of the United States when it came to Christianity Jacob so I can I'm not I don't
(34:11) understand the governing Authority the governing body for religion Christianity inside of the United States that's not
(34:17) Catholicism that's not Orthodoxy is it no no so it could be possible as well
(34:22) that you're drawing a corlet that doesn't even exist here the correlate being that as we centralize power that
(34:29) this is going to go against Christianity my argument back to you is no as long as you are not centralizing power with
(34:35) Protestants who then fracture off into 40,000 different denominations it's the fact that they are not centralized it's
(34:42) the fact that they're not centralized actually which destroys their power
(34:47) here's my argument to you my argument is right this second if there was one single solid uh Church which was a
(34:55) Protestant Church let's just call it for the purpose of this mental exercise the Church of Martin Luther okay
(35:02) conservatives would then be in charge of the most powerful institution in the United States which would be that church
(35:08) not liberals not progressives conservatives would be and that is what happens when actually you fracture away
(35:15) your power is that evil men and progressives come in and they Seize Your institutions and they centralize it
(35:22) against you you cannot actually defend against the powerful without yourself
(35:28) being powerful and that c you have to have some form of collectivism to do that in this case I would say
(35:34) Christianity is a great one um yeah I mean I think Christianity is a buw workk against uh oppressive
(35:41) regimes and that's why oppressive regimes try to subvert the church historically uh I don't yeah yeah I I
(35:47) but I I don't think that uh Catholicism or Eastern Orthodox Churches have exactly uh Protected Their societies
(35:55) from their governments becoming uh tyrannical either so I'm not sure that no no no wait they have and that's why
(36:02) the first thing the Communists do to the Orthodox Church is what well they but they what they do
(36:09) they persecute them no so they they took them all they took they took the Orthodox Zar out and they murdered him
(36:16) and his entire family the Bolshevik did and then they went through and systematically slaughtered all of the
(36:21) Orthodox which existed in the East that they could possibly get their hands on exactly because they were a power
(36:27) Central Central Church which could stop Communists so you're saying
(36:34) that but you're saying because they lost yeah just because they lost doesn't mean that the idea that centralizing Force if
(36:41) they had had some sort of like standing army or some sort of warrior class let's say they might have been able to stand a
(36:46) much larger chance they only had a centralized power with the political class that in and of itself is still a
(36:51) great B workk they at least had something we don't we don't have anything we're just literally right for
(36:57) the bro we're rip for the plucking you won't get much disagreement for me that protest protestantism is
(37:03) largely a failure in terms of being a bulwark against these things so I wouldn't have much push back with you
(37:08) there other than I I just haven't managed to uh uh convince myself yet of Catholicism or Eastern Orthodoxy so uh
(37:16) but that's not the purpose of what we're here for today I I think that yeah I mean uh these are all gradients right so
(37:22) I mean the American experiment might have lasted longer if it wasn't protestantism if it was maybe major Catholicism or or Eastern Orthodoxy but
(37:30) I I still think that this the incentive structures of a monopoly of power like that and again I think this is
(37:35) biblically based this is essentially the warning that God gave uh through Samuel to the Israelites when they asked for a
(37:42) king because in the Book of Judges they still had government but it was decentralized and when they were like hey we want a king we want a centralized
(37:48) authority to solve our problems for you God wasn't like finally this is what I've been waiting for you guys to ask
(37:53) for he was like uh no first of all you're rejecting me as your king uh and he's going to take from you
(37:59) actually it's really crucial he says he's going to take 10% from you and that's really significant because 10% is
(38:05) what's owed to God so he's like he's going to be uh it's going to be idolatry he's going I me so what there's counter
(38:10) examples to all of that including judges why do we have judges what were judges well that was an example of
(38:17) governance yeah that's what what I mean what were they though what hang on what were judges what were
(38:23) they well well some of them were like military leaders and some of them were uh they were centralized they were
(38:29) centralized Authority yeah but I'm saying they were a centralized Authority all of these all on not only were they a
(38:35) centralized Authority but they were a fantastic centralized Authority and what they were able to do is bring actual
(38:41) Justice what happens is when you Whittle away at the government with your stupid libertarian idealism what you do is you
(38:48) actually destroy centralized power for conservatism and I'm going to give you an example in real time of how that happens and occurs you ever hear the
(38:55) fairness Doctrine no I don't think so okay well this is before perhaps before your time but in
(39:02) the 1990s you may not know this but the conservatives had taken over all of national radio all of it every bit okay
(39:09) now I know this yeah yeah yeah and the Liberals came in and said oh wait we we we want this to be fair blah blah blah
(39:16) blah blah blah blah we need more airtime we need more it's not fair that conservatives have a monopo on media
(39:22) none of that's fair was Libertarians who whittel away at conservative resistances saying no we should have more of a
(39:30) battle of the ideas we should have more of the other side voices coming in here
(39:36) and speaking we should have more of that they were Whitted away at the conservative power base Libertarians are
(39:42) solely responsible for the erosion of conservatism inside of the United States because they claim that we're not
(39:49) allowed to have Central Power and we if we don't have it the progressives will take it anyway that's the flaw in your
(39:55) argument progressives will take whether you want them to or not conservatives May listen to you but they have no way
(40:01) to fight back if you don't let them have Central Power they can't do it it's a lot harder for them to take power if it
(40:07) if it's not there in the first place if it's decentralized now you can you can you can look at this at different levels
(40:13) right so like yeah judges if you go to those specific tribes and areas then
(40:18) there'd be centralization for a time or in a specific region for a specific dispute and so I'm not like a there are
(40:25) some listen there are some wacky Libertarians who say like yeah we shouldn't have any rules or any hierarchies or uh even if you have like
(40:31) a local governance that's oppressive and I'm I'm not going there like I said my My Views have evolved over the last
(40:37) couple years and so I'm I'm okay with decentralized government that at the local level can actually be pretty
(40:43) active in fact some Libertarians would question my libertarian credentials because I think
(40:48) at the local level uh not only can government be a little bit more Hands-On but I think that the churches should be
(40:54) a big part of that yeah so AR aren't uh you universities decentralized I I mean some universities
(41:02) a lot of them get but they're decentralized uh I I don't know I I
(41:09) don't know if that's a because because I mean a lot of them are connected right explain how they're centralized how they're a central position of power
(41:16) other than the soft power that they wield that's that's their power right but they're not a centralized form of so
(41:23) in other words can universities send armed men over to enforce their
(41:29) will well well no but they're they're they're almost like they're they're just an arm of the the bureaucratic uh
(41:35) leftist progress well then so is everything that's the thing though is that this is a problem when you say decentralized power try to understand
(41:42) how illogical it is from my perspective what you're saying here's what you're saying Andrew inside of society there
(41:49) are hundreds of millions of people whose ideology is that the state must seize
(41:55) control of every everything possible and destroy all religion in order to free
(42:02) Mankind from itself and give them a stateless society where we all live for each other hundreds of millions of
(42:07) people believe this ideology in order to combat that the best thing we can do is
(42:13) make sure that we have less power that's what that's actually what you're saying to
(42:19) me and and how would that combat these people if if they're I mean if you have
(42:27) it's easy to hijack institutions where the ability to tax the ability to seize
(42:32) property the ability to conscript uh and the Monopoly of law over a giant land
(42:38) mass with with millions of people when that already exists it's easy for these
(42:43) leftists to come in and and wield those against uh us wield those against the church wield those against uh the values
(42:50) that you and I would mostly agree it's not easy it's not actually easy for them to do this unless libertarian ology gets
(42:57) in there and says to them things like you should not wield force in government for ethics you should not wield law
(43:05) against the Citizens to enforce ethical standards rather people should be able to do whatever they want as long as
(43:11) they're not aggressing on other people you create this open back door for power to seize your institutions because what
(43:17) happens is moral men act in the way that you're prescribing immoral men refuse to
(43:23) act in the way that you're prescribing and so what they do is they seize power of those institutions and you let them
(43:28) right in through the front door instead of recognizing this ideology will not go away the only way to successfully combat
(43:35) the guy on the the um playground who has the biggest fist is to make sure that
(43:41) you can pound him harder right yeah I just I just don't agree with that that characterization of of how how we got
(43:46) here like I've heard it sounds similar to like Michael nles said when he was on Tim cast like a Libertarians dup the
(43:52) conservatives and this is why we're in the best we're in today and I just I disagree with that like conservatives uh
(43:58) were hijacked by like the buckit and the Neo neocons who they weren't trying to
(44:03) uh government small yeah you mean Progressive Libertarians those are progressive Libertarians not I mean call
(44:11) them Libertarians that's just like that's making the word libertarian meaningless if it if it
(44:17) descries when you make an egalitarian when you make the argument the pro argument for egalitarian systems for
(44:23) Equity between human beings and egalitarianism essentially you are moving towards a
(44:29) Libertarian Paradigm Libertarians have to concede to uh some form of
(44:34) egalitarianism and some form of equity otherwise none of your shit's going to work you have to bake in the Assumption
(44:40) for instance that people can uh you know sign these contracts that they can live inside of these societies without there
(44:46) being a threat of force my argument and contention is that no they can't and that what all it takes all it takes is a
(44:53) single man to say no we want their [ __ ] and now you're right for the plucking you're right for the plucking that's it
(45:00) that's the end of it it's done so this is this is where we'll have some crossover like I alluded to earlier because I actually think that there's
(45:05) some truth to what you're saying and I think a lot of Libertarians need to learn this lesson um so actually like I
(45:11) I come from like uh like I'm I'm friends with with Dave Smith and I'd say I'm like a Dave Smith style libertarian and
(45:17) Dave often says that libert conservatives need to learn a Libertarian lesson and Libertarians need
(45:22) to learn a conservative lesson and I actually think that Libertarians are uh Miss guided if they think that their
(45:28) ideas can ever come close to reality I don't even think we're listen like the Libertarians who are thinking we're going to have some kind of stateless
(45:34) society uh need to wake up um there's a lot of people in uh like in my you're
(45:40) watching this video of me ear ear earlier today and I was talking back then in real time when it was happening
(45:45) and I I didn't understand their criticisms at that point people like from from my world Pete konz Matt
(45:51) Erikson uh guys like CJ Engel who are basically you know leaving libertarian
(45:56) movement kind of move more into sort of like your your territory and the reason being that a lot of Libertarians are
(46:02) living in fantasy land basically living in what they would call ancapistan in their head and at the time I I kind of
(46:07) didn't realize their point but over the last couple years I've kind of come to see that there's a lot of Truth to what they're saying and I think Libertarians
(46:14) need to actually grow up a little bit and realize that hey we need to work in the real world I'm not envisioning that
(46:20) in my life time that that even if all the Libertarians magically work together we're going to have some kind of perfect
(46:26) libertopia come in but I do think that the answer is still not ultimately down
(46:31) the path of centralizing power and I would say that only way that we're going to ultimately want centralized power for
(46:39) religion I I want I want I want a uh a a centralized power in terms of a a
(46:46) cultural Force how manyur how many Church hang hang on hang on how many church is there only one
(46:52) church I mean there's there's the body of Christ yeah yeah that's one right how many how many is
(46:59) that I mean there's the visible church and then there's the yeah yeah the body of Christ though how many bodies of
(47:05) Christ are there uh ultimately one oh so it's
(47:11) monolith right well the Kingdom of Heaven is a monolith right so it's a so it's a monolith sounds it sounds like
(47:16) it's very centralized doesn't it sounds like it's a very much it's very much this all I TR with that power well I
(47:23) don't understand uh who's the church uh well the the the church is still men
(47:29) though right okay so who is it it's men and how many are there supposed to be how many how many
(47:36) churches are there supposed to be one and what's it comprised of men very
(47:42) strange very strange this God character that you're pointing out who doesn't
(47:47) like this whole Monopoly on things gives us a single church for all men to join
(47:53) all men to join this one thing which creates a monopoly in fact I could never
(47:59) give you a better definition of a monopoly than everybody does this one
(48:04) thing what could be what possibly could be a better example of a monopoly than
(48:11) that I mean I'm I'm I'm a Christian I'm not sure I don't disagree with you the path is narrow right like and and even
(48:18) many who think they know God Jesus will say depart from me I never knew you so if all people joined this one Church
(48:25) would that create this massive power Monopoly well yeah I mean if everybody in the world became Christian then
(48:32) became a monopoly yeah the thing that you want so wait so let me just let me just get this right let me get this
(48:38) right Jacob you want everybody in the world to join this Monopoly creating the
(48:44) largest Monopoly of force in the history of the world that's your your libertarian solution to the crisis of
(48:51) Planet I just want to make sure I got that clear is that no no no no we're moving the goal poost to here I'm not saying we are you're you're conflating
(48:59) what I want with what I'm actually prescribing in terms of what is realistic why wouldn't you prescribe
(49:04) what you want well I mean you can you can have lofty goals but that doesn't mean that's
(49:10) what I think is realistically going to happen yeah okay but that's a descriptive is we're talking about ought
(49:17) you're saying people ought to all be Christians right okay I think we should start with the idea that we should make
(49:23) as many Christians as possible so everybody ought to be a Christian everybody ought to be a Christian uh
(49:29) yeah I don't everybody a Christian and if everybody ought to be a Christian everybody that in my opening statement I
(49:35) said the prescri everybody became a Christian right you would have the
(49:40) largest Monopoly on of force on planet Earth correct I mean sure I mean that's
(49:46) almost what the Bible describes that we're going to have a you know I mean not going es cetology but there'll be a
(49:51) a reign with Christ with his body sure well super weird so you would agree
(49:56) that this would have to come in stages right like 50% of planet Earth was Christian then 60% of planet Earth was
(50:03) Christian then 70% was Christian etc etc right yeah I mean I I'm I'm more of an
(50:09) on- millennialist than a post millennialist although I'm an optimistic a millennialist so uh I'm not sure that
(50:15) we will have this incremental move to 100% and then uh usher in you know the
(50:20) physical Kingdom on Earth if that happens great um I'm not sure it's going to be exactly uh like that but if it
(50:27) okay well let's let's phrase it a different way let's assume right now 10% of planet Earth were Christians right
(50:33) let's just assume it we're it's hypothetical Jacob not saying it's true just hypothetical we're going to assume
(50:39) 10% of planet Earth are Christians would you want it to be 20% absolutely would you want it to be
(50:46) 30% absolutely okay so if incrementally it went tomorrow from 10% hypothetically
(50:52) to 20% thus doubling the amount of force that it could apply you would want that
(50:57) wouldn't you I would I would want the the uh increase of Christianity sure and would
(51:04) those Christians then be the people who were in your government and when they were in your government would they be
(51:10) creating your policy I'm not again like I said in my intro I'm not against Christian government but I think we have to get into the details of how that's
(51:16) defined sure sure sure sure I get it I get it I get it but you would want all of your government to be Christians in
(51:22) sure yeah and you would want everybody inside of your government who applied force to be Christians wouldn't you yes
(51:28) okay great so then what we have established is is that Jacob the libertarian wants Christians to have a
(51:34) complete in total Monopoly on all force on planet Earth if he can do it w this
(51:39) is some real mind-blowing libertarianism that you got going on here Jacob you have really cracked the code with this
(51:45) one brother I wish I had been able to go back in time and apply that I was also a
(51:51) Libertarian who believed in a unifor singular church as a prescription for everyone on planet Earth
(51:57) I'm sure that I wouldn't have gotten laughed out of the room at all yeah still moving you're still moving the
(52:02) goal post from you're asking me do I want more Christians and then would that consequently mean more Christians in
(52:08) government and I'm sorry thereal entailments those are logical entailments
(52:13) Jacob so are you saying you don't want more Christians and therefore to create more Christians in
(52:19) government no okay then what is what is your prescription well I mean my my
(52:25) prescription what I've always said is that I'm maybe I misunderstood your
(52:31) question say your question again so so I mean because because honestly I mean I've heard you describe yourself as a
(52:36) Christian nationalist but I know that's not like one thing people believe different things but what I thought you said was would
(52:44) you recommend that less people became or more people became Christian I said yes but maybe that's not what you asked so
(52:50) what did you actually ask I asked you would want more people to become Christian and therefore more uh people
(52:56) in your government to be Christian yeah right and I want all those Force applicators to be governed by Christians
(53:02) and if they're moral men I don't really give a [ __ ] how big the government gets I don't really care if they have a
(53:08) monopoly on force and I don't really care if you cannot defend yourself adequately against those moral men I
(53:16) think if we I think if we have devout Christians following biblical principles in government that they will use Force
(53:21) to uphold property rights and I don't see a Biblical justification for initiating Force against uh nonviolent
(53:29) but what makes that libertarian that makes that centralized power again that all you're saying is that if Christians
(53:34) held centralized power that they would enforce property rights with centralized power yeah I agree what's your
(53:40) point well I I mean I think you defining libertarianism in a different way than than I am um well no I don't think so I
(53:47) think we just went over at ad nauseum decentralization of power uh over to limited property rights with small
(53:53) government that is what you said we so I don't think there would be one there would still be different government
(54:00) across the world and they would all be different Christian there' be a Christian government and I ideally
(54:05) wouldn't want a American government I'd probably want it more granular than that so like you would I live in Pennsylvania
(54:10) so I'd want a Pennsylvanian government that is Christian that would be neighboring with the Maryland uh
(54:17) government that is they all but feasibly if you could would they all be part of
(54:22) the one truth Body of Christ in Pennsylvania and in Maryland those are
(54:27) different but those are different you have the sphere of the church and then you that's really hang on that's really weird because if you had localized
(54:33) leadership you would have things like Bishops and you would have clergy who would cross over these states and they
(54:39) would make like cross state uh policy right they would make cross state
(54:45) prescriptions for how morality should be run and then yeah well before you knew it Jacob they would be working together
(54:52) and uniting with each other in order to continue to spread their reach so that more people became part of that one
(54:59) church right we should be growing the church absolutely right right so what happens is you're just all you're doing is
(55:05) saying this here's here's your entire position Andrew I want a centralized authority of moral Christian men who
(55:12) then go on to take over the entirety of the United States and Rule it as moral
(55:18) people that's that's your actual position right I think we're just
(55:23) disagreeing that you think that's not commensurate with libertarianism it's not libertarianism what is
(55:28) libertarianism then is it big Monopoly government unified under a single religion is that libertarianism already
(55:34) said I would no no because you keep you're saying that the church would be the the government and I'm saying no the
(55:40) governments would be separate from the church the churcha with the government nope not possible you cannot if you're
(55:46) part of a single unified body I Mead so yes the the body of Christ as the church
(55:53) yes would be like in a spiritual sense as the body of Christ governing that Nation so to speak if it
(55:59) was the majority where does culture come from uh culture comes from people comes
(56:04) from theology cultures downwind of Theology and governments downwind of culture so you're saying that the entire
(56:10) culture and the entire monop of force the entire foundational route for your ideology is a singular unified religion
(56:18) among men who have a monopoly but there would still be different institutions there would still be no what how could
(56:24) you have a different institution be one body the the the they would be one of part of one body in a Christian sense in
(56:31) a biblical sense of being one body of Christ but then uh in terms of what happens in human society you would have
(56:38) uh You' still have uh different spheres of and institutions of human government and courts and things like that and they
(56:44) wouldn't be part of just you know one universal church across the entire I think well I think that they would I
(56:50) think that everything which informed all of those judges and everybody else's morality would be that one unified
(56:55) Church church and they would risk a penalty of excommunication should they govern in such a way that that one
(57:01) unified Church didn't like right almost like checks and balances in a way yeah I I I find it unlikely that it
(57:08) would be one church I mean I mean like you could say no I'm not I'm saying let's just assume for a second that it's
(57:14) almost logically impossible not quite but almost like it's never going to happen as a descriptive is that is what
(57:20) you want to happen though one yeah it would be great if all the theological
(57:27) divides between Christians were solved we became one unified body
(57:32) sure right so I mean if this is the ultimate op like I said then why aren't we moving towards that I don't I don't
(57:38) get that why shouldn't you move towards that should move towards that great then you're Christian nationalist you're
(57:44) coming over to my side right we should be moving towards a singular church and the body and authority of all people in
(57:50) the United States should be governed by the ethics of that church and they should have a complete and total Monopoly of force I love this jacob we
(57:57) have completely solved this problem you're no longer a Libertarian you're coming over to the dark side right uh I
(58:04) I I think that uh I mean ultimately I'd have questions for you in terms of your Christian nationalism because I haven't actually heard your Christian
(58:10) nationalism I've actually talked to So like um our our CEO at libertarian
(58:16) Christian Institute we were talking the other night and I I was describing My Views as almost Christian nationalism
(58:22) light uh in a way so again I I do think we have some crossover and I think there's some Libertarians in the chat
(58:28) who actually yeah who who are like oh you're not a real libertarian well I don't care I'm still incorporating a lot
(58:34) of libertarian political uh uh philosophy into into what I'm prescribing and what I'm moving towards
(58:41) uh but I'm a Christian first I'm not a ideologically possessed libertarian um I guess ultimately what it comes down
(58:48) we've almost got the rest of that nonsense beaten out of your skull so you can just come the rest of the way over to moving towards the a that you want to
(58:55) see this is the a that you want to see why aren't we moving towards the a that you want to see bro listen the the devil is
(59:01) in the details in terms of that I I still think that uh it needs to be
(59:06) stressed that I think there is no biblical justification for using civil governance at any level to initiate
(59:13) violence against nonviolent people and that is ultimately what makes me uh a Libertarian is that I reject the use of
(59:20) of political violence against peaceful people well then who getaran who gets to
(59:25) Define what violence is then you I would say by Christian Norms should be the by
(59:32) okay wait hang wait what wait what so wait a second you want the defining
(59:39) ideals for what constitutes violence to be done by who uh Christians I that
(59:46) would that require some sort of centralization in force again Jacob uh I mean listen I think even with well I
(59:52) shouldn't say this because protestantism is a mess um between between between like the good Protestant branches and
(59:59) Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy there's really not any disagreement over major moral issues so I mean I think we
(1:00:06) can create a sort of this is sort of what like Doug Wilson talks about who I have disagreements with but he talks about like a mere Christian D and he
(1:00:13) describes himself almost as a Theocratic libertarian in a sense because he's trying to create a just sort of like a a
(1:00:19) Christian consensus right Jacob what are you going to do with all of those nonviolent atheists who just have a different definition of what violence
(1:00:27) is um no I don't I don't have a pro if someone commits violence like steals
(1:00:33) property and they say well in my view it's not violent I don't care we'll use Force to stop them oh okay so got it so
(1:00:38) essentially what you're saying is this is that you are going to be the ultimate
(1:00:43) Arbiter of what constitutes violence a good example of this for instance is going to be abortion do you think that
(1:00:49) atheists and progressives think that it's violence to abort a child a lot of them well I mean some some of them prend
(1:00:56) it's violence and then they still end up saying but it should be legal anyway so practically most of them don't think
(1:01:02) it's violence yeah most of them don't think it's violence right so if you the person who tells them Jacob well listen
(1:01:11) any time people perpetuate violence from a civil Authority on those who are
(1:01:16) nonviolent they're wrong that atheist Progressive is going to be like yeah sure that's that sounds great by the way
(1:01:23) uh here suck this out of me real quick doc and that's not violence Jacob how are you going to convince them that it
(1:01:30) is violence Jacob are you going to and even if and if they don't think it's violence they don't think that it is are
(1:01:37) you gonna use violence anyway uh yeah yeah so the thing is is
(1:01:42) that really what that's Libertarians libertarianism is fundamentally against the initiation of aggression The Unborn
(1:01:48) are still people well that's nice you get to determine what that means though and you Haven told me why we should yield why should we yield to that some's
(1:01:56) going to determ right now why should they yield to that Jacob why should they yield to your definition of violence why
(1:02:02) well this is where your prescriptions and descriptions are right and I agree with you that in a sense in a society
(1:02:07) might does make right to that's right and this is why we do need to create a Christian majority in consensus that's
(1:02:13) right so here's the difference between us I say this I say oh yeah you don't think that that's violence that's great I'm going to Institute the Civil
(1:02:19) Authority against you anyway [ __ ] off right on abortion I mostly agree with
(1:02:24) you yeah but but you no I'm saying to you that prescriptively prescriptively not not even
(1:02:31) descriptively that prescriptively it's okay to use civil Authority against non-violent people because these people
(1:02:37) who are quote nonviolent would only be able to follow whatever your definition of nonviolence is if they followed their
(1:02:44) own you would still consider it an act of violence you have not given an argument for why they should yield to
(1:02:49) yours why should they yield to what you consider violence to be instead of what they consider it to be like for instance
(1:02:55) they could do human sacrifice right Jacob and say this isn't violence Our God hath ordained that I take this guy
(1:03:02) up here cut his [ __ ] heart out and sacrifice it to Raw that's not violence
(1:03:08) B he he said he wanted to there's nothing violent going on here you wouldn't you wouldn't take the Civil
(1:03:14) Authority anyway and put him put him to the sword Jacob yeah I wouldn't have no
(1:03:20) problem using Civil Authorities to stop Human Sacrifice so what is your argument to him for why it is violent
(1:03:26) why should he so so right now we're not too far off where I wouldn't have an argument or even a monopoly of force to
(1:03:33) stop him um but I'm hoping we can turn the ti on that and yeah so this is again I repeat I agree with the framework you
(1:03:40) often use because I've listened to you a lot that that yes we and this is really just a restating of the idea that that
(1:03:46) politics is Downstream from culture um and it's there's some interplay because politics can influence culture as well
(1:03:52) but ultimately yeah like if if we have an immoral people who redefine things like uh the killing of The Unborn or you
(1:04:00) know Human Sacrifice or or other things that are aggression and they say these aren't aggression that that is wrong and
(1:04:07) if we could get the government to use Force to stop them that would be great but we don't have the majority right now
(1:04:14) to easily do that and so we need to focus on uh on doing that on but but
(1:04:19) Jacob I I just want to let you know and I didn't cut you off I went through the entirety of that you didn't actually
(1:04:24) answer my question why should all why should 40 or 30% of the population which is atheist right
(1:04:31) now okay let's assume it's somewhere in there I don't think it's that high but let's assume that it is 30% why should
(1:04:36) they yield to your definition of violence instead of their own why why ought
(1:04:42) they why ought they uh they're
(1:04:48) wrong by Christian standards so right now they so and I would listen I would
(1:04:53) say so wait wait so hang on hang on you realize not an argument to say because they're wrong why you have to tell me
(1:05:00) why they should why they well so listen you you uh you try to use words and
(1:05:07) persuasion and reason but if people are Beyond Reason yeah then you do have to
(1:05:12) result to force yeah so essentially this right do what I [ __ ] say or else
(1:05:19) libertarianism with Jacob winegrad ladies and gentlemen do what I say by my moral
(1:05:27) standards else don't don't hurt people and don't take their stuff is like libertarianism 101 and yes you can use
(1:05:34) Force to tell people the problem the problem is you're acting within this nebulous gray area of what is and is not
(1:05:42) violence and you're saying that they ought to uphold your standard for what violence is because you just really
(1:05:47) [ __ ] want them to Jacob Jacob hang on because you just really want them to so tell me why they actually should other
(1:05:54) than because otherwise Jacob's going to go over there with an army that has a bunch of [ __ ] boom boom sticks and
(1:06:00) make you uh listen I I come from the libertarian tradition of of of Roth
(1:06:07) rothbard and and and The misus Institute guys and and those Libertarians like Hans Herman haa they've always
(1:06:13) understood the importance of culture and the idea that libertarianism does not work without a moral people and really
(1:06:18) without a Christian people um and so yeah I am willing to impose the Christian worldview through governance I
(1:06:25) just happen to think that the Christian worldview is commensurate with libertarian principles yeah once that
(1:06:32) once we have Christian principles are do what I want or else right well yes there
(1:06:38) is an aspect to human society that you you describe well that it you do have to
(1:06:44) like there are people who aren't going to agree now now listen I want I I'll make a caveat here what I'm not going to
(1:06:49) justify creating is is like some kind of like Christian imperialism where it's like we need to go halfway across the
(1:06:55) world and tame these Savages or or or something like that I'm not going to create a uh you know like Christian
(1:07:02) nationalism light my version of Christian libertarianism or whatever you want to call it wouldn't justify that I
(1:07:08) don't think we should I still think that the emphasis should be on making these things as decentralized as possible as
(1:07:13) as local as possible as ground up as possible but yeah like at some point at that whatever whether it's to the state
(1:07:20) or the locality there will still be uh calized Authority they're still going to
(1:07:25) be at some level of centralized Authority there's going to be a centralized Authority and if they don't adhere to your standards of Christian ethics they're conducting violence and
(1:07:31) you're go over there and you're going to go over there with boom boom sticks and make them [ __ ] comply yeah there there does Jacob there has to be law
(1:07:38) enforced yeah but Jacob IE I agree with all of that that there has to be law has
(1:07:43) to be enforced there has to be a central authority to enforce that law there has to be judges there has to be cops there has to be law enforcement has to be military there has to be all this stuff
(1:07:50) in order to do all of that but you still I just want to let you know this is the third time I'm going to ask this cuz
(1:07:55) actually have not answered the question in all three times I've asked it within the Nuance of what Jacob considers
(1:08:02) violence to be why ought atheist if you told an atheist you ought to do what I what my version of violence is which
(1:08:09) includes uh like a Plan B pill let's say can't take a Plan B pill that's violence
(1:08:15) right isn't that violence I don't remember the exact science of the Plan B pill okay the
(1:08:21) abortion pill the abortion pill right if it's if it's an actual abortion pill now I also make will make a distinction
(1:08:27) between what is morally permissible and what is prudent because uh I would also have a problem with things that would
(1:08:34) resemble the war on drugs and there's some things that might be morally permissible to say hey the law could do
(1:08:40) this but doesn't mean that it's practical doesn't mean that you can actually implement it without some greater violation of Rights so there's a
(1:08:45) little bit of nuance there um but in terms of this the heart of your question and I want to make sure I answer it this
(1:08:51) time you're asking why uh they listen to me if they disagree agree with me nope that's not my question and I'm going to
(1:08:57) be hyper specific here okay Jacob says my moral grounding ethics for what
(1:09:03) violence is needs to be adhered to by you the atheist and my reason for that
(1:09:12) is uh Christianity is right oh and if you don't follow it we're
(1:09:20) going to make you follow it I mean I I will make people follow the parts of Christianity that can be
(1:09:27) imposed by force which is essentially the libertarian parts of do not murder and do not steal yeah if you do but but
(1:09:33) you have to understand that within their ethical framework they're saying no this
(1:09:39) isn't true you're wrong you have not de you have not demonstrated hang on Jacob you have not demonstrated to me that
(1:09:46) this is actually a murder or violence of any kind you have not demonstrated that
(1:09:51) so therefore it is not we're not going to do it and Jacob says yes you are or else because if you don't we're g to
(1:09:59) come [ __ ] make you right Jacob uh if we had the Christian
(1:10:04) majority to make that happen sure if we didn't it might be a little bit tougher yeah but you would prefer that we did
(1:10:11) yeah I would prefer people not be murdered and I'd prefer proper welcome to Christian populism welcome to the
(1:10:18) actual conservative M movement where we're not so stupid that we don't understand that the application of force
(1:10:25) from the Civil authority to enforce things that we consider to be moral even if you don't is not only necessary but
(1:10:32) we're going to move Society towards that because the problem you have here is
(1:10:37) that that you have become the god of the system because what you say is you say
(1:10:43) listen you people all of you have to adhere to what I consider violence to be
(1:10:48) if you do not adhere to what I consider violence to be I will use violence on
(1:10:53) you pretty big authoritarianism Jacob uh I mean listen like I said in my
(1:11:00) intro I'm I'm I'm not against the just use of of authority there is a just use
(1:11:06) Authority from the Christian world view I am a Christian so um okay but but it's just a matter of defining those things
(1:11:12) and uh I I would still be uh in my opinion a Libertarian who says that no
(1:11:17) if someone is smoking uh weed or even shooting up crack and not hurting anyone uh I'm I'm not going to go use Force to
(1:11:24) stop them if people are we didn't get much stuff what if someone's shooting up
(1:11:29) crack and they're not hurting okay well okay now I get it yeah yeah yeah so let's make sure uh going into marriage
(1:11:35) then so gay marriage good they can do that it's fine you don't have a problem with it I'm not going to use Force to
(1:11:40) stop gay people from getting together although I agree with your prescription that we should divorce the institution
(1:11:45) of marriage from the state because all that's LED from that is that the state is subverted and destroyed I'm sorry I'm
(1:11:50) sorry why should why why ought I allow gays to get married why ought I
(1:11:56) uh there's there's no violation of of property rights there's no uh Act of aggression against another person they
(1:12:03) Yeah by my definition there is well that I that's what matters is my
(1:12:08) definition right Jacob my definition of what these things are is what matters
(1:12:13) and therefore as long as it falls under the purview of what I consider to be moral then it's time for the mighty
(1:12:20) sword to come out and enforce my will isn't it Jacob right right so this is
(1:12:25) again where and I'm not dodging your question I'm just I'm trying to agree with you is that your descriptors about
(1:12:31) how Society operates through a sort of Might makes right uh framework is not
(1:12:36) wrong like this is something that like sterer talked about who's like a classical uh Anarchist thinker who very
(1:12:42) left-wing and degenerate I'm not not I don't uh he's not my guiding uh
(1:12:47) libertarian uh philosopher but he made that observation too it's something Libertarians uh know and I've even
(1:12:53) talked about on my show that yeah there's an aspect of society uh that that is very much like we can there's
(1:12:58) there is what's morally uh normative and what we prescribe and there are well
(1:13:04) let's dive into the this absurdity I'll be as as good faith as possible for this
(1:13:09) right even though I feel like pointing this kind of absurdity out over and over again has been fun I would like to dive
(1:13:15) into this a little bit more um let's assume for a second I assume that you think that a person Marrying an animal
(1:13:21) is not okay because that would be um a you know transgression of the non-aggression principle correct because
(1:13:27) the animal can't consent and all that stuff I I don't know you don't know I
(1:13:32) will admit that that's not one I've really thought about I don't know if animals really have you don't know rights uh so oh yeah they don't they
(1:13:39) don't so they're your property why can't you marry why you marry one rights are fictitious anyway but yeah so why why
(1:13:45) can't they marry a goat bro I don't know that I would want to wield uh civil authority to stop them
(1:13:53) from marrying a goat I mean it's it's the you're not sure that
(1:13:59) you would let the Civil Authority go in and prevent people from marrying their Barnyard animals Jacob I mean that's not
(1:14:06) the hill I would die on so if if if uh if my state and Community pass laws
(1:14:11) preventing that I'm not going to be acting to repeal them can they go marry a dead body
(1:14:17) Jacob uh no I'd say the dead body is still a human body
(1:14:23) and even though the soul is left it's still not it's nothing it's just a husk
(1:14:28) right like if you were going to if you were going to die for certain you were with your child and you were like up in
(1:14:34) a snowbank like in Al live the movie alive and uh you were going to starve and your kid was going to starve if you
(1:14:40) didn't eat one of the pilots I mean it's bone appetite time right it is bone
(1:14:45) appeti you are grabbing a fork and a knife and you're getting the grill going and man that kid is going to make it
(1:14:51) through that winter in the Alps isn't he
(1:14:56) um yeah I don't know I mean uh I would probably draw the line at at desecrating
(1:15:03) human bodies I I don't think that you would eat a dead body if if if it meant feeding your kid you wouldn't do it I'd
(1:15:09) do it well fucker's face you know what I mean if like if that was the only way I
(1:15:15) was getting out right like I would go home and I'd tell my wife I'd be like look baby you know how much I love you
(1:15:20) you know how much I love you when I was up on that Mountaintop I was getting home home and I ate a dude's [ __ ]
(1:15:27) face I ate his face to get back to you baby right like
(1:15:34) I mean I would I would I would eat their face right if if that's what it took to get off the mountain I would do that
(1:15:40) right but you know why I would never do that to somebody who was alive though because a dead body has no more moral
(1:15:45) value really the only the only thing about desecration which comes uh that's a a punishment a crime against yourself
(1:15:53) right it's a crime against you it's context specific like if you find a dead body out in the wilderness versus like
(1:15:59) you go into a hospital and go into the uh the mor and pull out dead body like I think those are two different things by
(1:16:06) uh you know even by property rights and contract law so yeah no no I get it so
(1:16:12) but let's assume for a second then under this scenario that um a dude who
(1:16:17) happened to be a homosexual wrote out in his will that he wanted uh some other
(1:16:22) guy to marry his dead body and then have sex with it if he wanted
(1:16:31) to uh I mean yeah that's that's pretty
(1:16:38) degenerate um yeah like think that doesn't happen but uh but but but but if it did but if it did h i
(1:16:47) mean so again is is that a law that I would die on the hill of preventing wouldn't
(1:16:53) yeah you're no way if I mean there's no way that Jacob's going to going to send the Civil authority over to tell the
(1:17:01) next Manson family member that he can't have sex with of his former partner's
(1:17:07) corpse and marry it I mean that would be
(1:17:13) crazy yeah I think so so can you can you draw the the so like let's say for sake
(1:17:19) of argument I grant that like yeah we should have a law against that and the other examples you've given so why does that extend to gay to because the only
(1:17:26) argument that you can make for why a person shouldn't marry a goat if you believe that a goat is simply property
(1:17:32) and you must because obviously you will eat a goat's face and you will have no moral qualms about doing so you'll eat
(1:17:38) it for breakfast won't you you'll wake up in the morning if somebody served a delicious Goat Face on a table you're
(1:17:44) going to gobble that [ __ ] down so fast and down a glass of iced cold orange
(1:17:50) juice with it so the thing is since we give them no moral consideration under this worldview you would have to concede
(1:17:57) the only reason you would stop them from marrying a goat and having sex with it even though you would allow them to eat it is because it's crime against
(1:18:05) themselves and since it's a crime against themselves you would need you have a moral duty to prevent that crime
(1:18:11) against thems you would have to make the same exact argument that homosexuality is a crime against yourself yeah I would
(1:18:17) I would probably so so what I would probably do for all the situations except for the gay marriage would would
(1:18:23) be definitely in favor of at least some form of of ostracism to say like if you I me listen I'm not going to go like I
(1:18:30) don't want to create a surveillance state where we're spying on people's homes to see if they're screwing goats I
(1:18:35) mean we don't have we don't have a surveillance state for that now but it's certainly a crime to screw a goat you go to
(1:18:41) jail that evil the evil civil Authority that you're against currently will throw
(1:18:46) you in jail for [ __ ] a goat Jacob should they not do that are they are they out of line there Jacob are they
(1:18:52) really are they out of line do we do we need to stop these pants Jacob I'm going to I'm going to air on the side of
(1:18:58) saying that no we don't need to stop them there although some some Libertarians might say that that I'm I'm deviating from libertarianism there but
(1:19:04) again I'm not ideologically possessed by libertarianism if I if I lose my libertarian credentials because I I'm
(1:19:10) not dying on the hill of banning uh you know people uh screwing animals then you
(1:19:18) know I again and at the same time I I would hope like the prescription I have
(1:19:23) is like we need to be ultimately working to make a society more virtuous more Christian and and if we're at the point
(1:19:30) where it's like man we need to stop people from screwing goats then we have a lot of work to do as a church and I think that uh that the culture cultural
(1:19:38) Decay if we're at that point is is is a you know I hate to be bad news Jacob but
(1:19:45) right this second there are people who [ __ ] goats yeah well in the United States and when they go to jail I think
(1:19:52) they belong there Jacob I think they should go to jail for that there's probably a good argument to be made that
(1:19:59) people who have hit that level of like mental derangement might not be uh of sound mind might be Aang to to other
(1:20:06) people that's just wa wait wait I don't wait I don't understand I don't understand hang on if an animal an
(1:20:13) animal has absolutely no value right it's not it's only value is going in
(1:20:19) your tum tum right you can literally eat it you have no problem with that if a
(1:20:25) guy like here let's let's answer it this way let's assume a guy breeds dogs okay
(1:20:30) he's breeding dogs he doesn't want any impurities this dog has a beautiful batch of puppies little puppy dogs and
(1:20:37) they got the big dough eyes and they they haven't even opened their eyes quite yet you know they're sniffing
(1:20:42) around looking for mama's teeth and he goes oh [ __ ] there's a defect in all of these they one of their big toes it's
(1:20:49) just a little too long that's going to create an impurity in the breed so he grabs all the little puppies and he
(1:20:54) [ __ ] drowns him right in his front yard he just drowns him by the way that happens in real time all the time for
(1:21:00) service dogs things like that you don't have any problem with that right it's not an
(1:21:06) issue um yeah I mean I I don't know I don't have the animal question is a tricky one
(1:21:13) and I'll have to be somewhat agnostic on where I stand on that that's not one I've given a whole lot of thought to so
(1:21:19) I I wouldn't give a definitive answer um but I mean right now do that then it's
(1:21:25) because the animal is your property unless you give it some type of value
(1:21:31) other than your property you would have to explain to me why you couldn't marry your property you'd have to explain that
(1:21:38) to me what the actual problem with that would be under your civil Authority except that you're doing something bad
(1:21:43) to you yeah I mean I guess this comes down to there's going to be like like there
(1:21:50) there is no neutrality in culture there's going to be a culture and I do think that uh there are some cultural
(1:21:57) norms that are going to be imposed right now we have cultural nor Norms that are trying to be imposed that are awful um
(1:22:04) that we should push back against um and and so the uh the Libertarians that I
(1:22:11) referenced before guys like Hans Herman HOA have talked about you know ways within a Libertarian legal order to
(1:22:17) prevent this kind of degeneracy from being allowed in in in within the within
(1:22:22) your community now does that mean that you need to go like if they become
(1:22:27) the uh the outcasts of society they're living in some like cave in a mountain
(1:22:32) or something like should we go hunt them down and and kill them like I wouldn't be an advocate uh or should we let them
(1:22:39) utilize our institutions to get married um if they're outcasts I don't I
(1:22:46) don't get it Jacob are they if they're Outcast living in a cave somewhere being ostracized from society why are we
(1:22:52) letting them use our institutions in order to get married it's interesting to talk about animals
(1:22:58) and and dead bodies but I still don't see how that becomes consistent because
(1:23:05) I'm explain have rights well just again the difference I see is that human beings like where I think it's a little
(1:23:12) bit ambiguous with the animal the case of the animal and the dead body with the case of gay marriage I don't see the
(1:23:18) same ambiguity those are living well I'm going to explain it to you so that there is no ambigu it you can only view an
(1:23:26) animal one of two ways either it has no moral value or it has moral value and if
(1:23:32) it does have moral value you have to assign some kind of moral value to it I don't know what hang hang on let me
(1:23:39) finish so that you understand the position all right so if it it's either going to have moral value or it's not
(1:23:44) how much moral value that's debatable but it either is or it isn't by the law of logic the law of excluded middle it
(1:23:52) either is or it is not and that's it right it can't be both so it either has moral value or it does not under your
(1:23:58) libertarian framework it does not so if that is the case and it's just property
(1:24:04) that's it then the only way you could actually prosecute a person for [ __ ] his own property would be if you said
(1:24:11) this is bad for you it's a crime against yourself if this is the case I would use
(1:24:16) the same argument about prostitution and homosexuality is a crime against yourself just like [ __ ] the goat so
(1:24:22) either the goat has more moral value and is not property or it does not have moral value and it is property you tell
(1:24:29) me which um well I mean the one thing that came to mind is that although yes they
(1:24:36) either have moral value or don't you could even say they have moral value doesn't make it equal to to human value
(1:24:42) didn't say it did but uh in terms of if we're going with the the level where
(1:24:47) they they uh they don't um again writers like like haa have have discussed how at
(1:24:53) you know uh Community level and even if you had like something like an incorporated city you
(1:24:58) could have through contract law you know that basically people have already agreed to by contract that you know
(1:25:04) these are things that they're not going to do in this community and if they violate that then then they're
(1:25:09) ostracized but I don't want communities around the [ __ ] goats even if they have it to be by contract Jacob right so this
(1:25:16) is where I don't even want I don't want them to have that Jacob I'm like no I don't I think it's a crime against humanity for you to [ __ ] go I'm not
(1:25:23) going to create a Christian bureaucratic State that's going around looking for degeneracy wherever it can find it to to
(1:25:29) stomp out um in terms of like you know if there if there's a small Collective
(1:25:35) living out in the woods being degenerate if they're not hurting anybody I'm not sure that I'm sorry is this whole nation
(1:25:40) your community um no I was talking more on a
(1:25:46) decentralized yeah I know but but like right now is this whole nation your
(1:25:52) community I mean it's sort of an imposed Community but is it your community or
(1:25:57) isn't it um like are you an American and you exercise the rights of an American
(1:26:04) you um you have some form of Americana you at least believe that your countrymen are American
(1:26:11) right I mean we we live in America and we're we're told we're you know we have we have citizenship so sure okay so if
(1:26:19) this is your community then why why don't you put that Outcast status in
(1:26:24) right now right this second within the community that you live in Jacob you
(1:26:30) just conflated description and prescription again like yeah it is true that right now the the society I live in
(1:26:36) were sort of forced into this American Community but that's not really the prescription I want in terms of uh
(1:26:43) governance or societal Oran well regardless of the size of the community I'm just granting the argument let us assume for a second that we have Jacob's
(1:26:49) worldview implemented and that we're going with Community you can have community commities the size of the
(1:26:55) United States correct there's actually nothing stopping that from happening is
(1:27:00) there uh I don't know that's you don't know you don't know if a community could
(1:27:06) be as big as the United States could it at least be as big as Canada or Mexico if a community could be as big as Canada
(1:27:12) or Mexico is it okay for that Community to ostracize these people and run them out Jacob and run them into caves like
(1:27:17) you want to do I I I I don't think you can have a like in terms of the sort of community I was describing in a
(1:27:23) libertarian sense I don't think you can have a a unified contract law that that
(1:27:30) extends that far in terms of geographic Mass why
(1:27:35) not um I mean I guess like yeah in theory you could but just like I don't think that's what would happen it seems
(1:27:41) practical to me you ever heard of some of the British trade unions which existed their re their corporate reach
(1:27:48) was that of Nations by the way let me give you an example right now right now
(1:27:54) of Walmart Walmart China considers Walmart its own country it trades with
(1:28:00) Walmart as a country it doesn't trade with Walmart as an individual Corporation it allocates it as a country
(1:28:09) to do business with it not even kidding that's how big Walmart is and it has
(1:28:14) contracts with all of these different nations utilizing contract Lots it's own Community you could say has its own
(1:28:20) employees has its own bylaws has its own internal contracts has its own
(1:28:26) everything it's its own kind of Covenant Community you could say even has anti-
(1:28:31) theft people who work around the clock it has CTV footage inside of its various communities to make sure that people
(1:28:37) can't take Goods away from anyone else it has it utilizes and pays local law enforcement to come in and seize people
(1:28:44) who are disruptors I mean it's basically the libertarian Utopia when you get right down to it
(1:28:50) Jacob uh yeah no I mean if you had some theoretical sense some giant corporation
(1:28:57) that spanned that that far and wide that everyone had agreed to that rule then I
(1:29:03) guess you could try to enforce it it just doesn't seem practical to me I mean Walmart does enforce it it seems very
(1:29:08) practical like if Walmart China said no homosexuals allowed right it could
(1:29:16) definitely enforce That Couldn't it okay definitely run them out of that Community couldn't it it could
(1:29:21) definitely be like uhuh uhuh no way yeah I I again I don't know that that's
(1:29:27) the the uh what I'd be advocating for from Christian principles yeah no I know
(1:29:32) but the problem is is that your Christian principles seem to contradict with your libertarian principles here's how there's two great ways that you're
(1:29:39) doing this the first way that you're contradicting your own Christian principles by the Nuance of what is
(1:29:44) violence you are taking a pacifistic approach with the nap well at the same
(1:29:50) time in contradiction saying that people must adhere to to what your version of
(1:29:55) violence is or else you will aggress against them period That's a that that is two contradicting principles at play
(1:30:02) that's one the second contradiction that you find yourself in is that you can't make a determination as to whether or
(1:30:09) not a person can violate their own property or not because it could potentially be a crime against thems
(1:30:15) here's another example of how I can play into this so that you understand the crime against yourself if your brother
(1:30:21) wanted to end his own life would you stop him yeah
(1:30:28) why um I think you have a duty to protect people from from violence wait a
(1:30:34) second if they're trying to commit violence against themselves but I think don't you own yourself Jacob who owns
(1:30:39) you except you Jacob I think there's a difference between uh sexual de
(1:30:44) degeneracy and and actual acts of violence against yourself don't you own yourself isn't your entire argument for
(1:30:51) drugs that you own yourself so therefore you should be able to do whatever you want to yourself why can't you end
(1:30:56) yourself if you own yourself if you see someone in the moment who is doing drugs in in a way that is lethal to them you
(1:31:03) could stop them and take them to a hospital I think that would be justified yeah but every time they do drugs it's the potential to be lethal
(1:31:09) Jacob true uh you know just like anything when you use Force you have to
(1:31:15) be able to you know act on some kind of degree of reasonability same with like self-defense like it has to be you can't
(1:31:22) be like oh he called me stupid so I pulled my gun out and shot him like it has to be like a a credible threat for
(1:31:28) you to act in self-defense and there' have to be a credible evidence of he was literally on death's door not likeo this
(1:31:34) is so weird I don't get this I don't get this at all do you own yourself or
(1:31:41) not uh in a legal sense yes okay in a spiritual sense do you own yourself in a
(1:31:47) spiritual sense that everything belongs to God so okay everything belongs to so you don't own yourself spiritually you
(1:31:53) just own yourself legally yeah so then the spiritual Duty should take precedent over the legal
(1:31:59) Duty in your worldview well the spiritual duty is for there to be in in God's order he has
(1:32:05) ordered Society in in such a way that we have these uh you know systems of
(1:32:11) governance these different spheres and so um because you know and I would say that God is the ultimate owner of of
(1:32:19) everything but that he has bestowed upon us the gift of uh being created in His
(1:32:24) Image and being uh of our own sound mind and will and uh has ordered society as
(1:32:30) such that we act as self- owners can you sell your soul Jacob uh I guess yeah so who owns
(1:32:44) it well I guess this would get a little bit into different ceries because I'm reformed so I think that uh I think
(1:32:51) ultimately if I'm if I'm part of the elect I can't actually sell my soul but uh now now we're open in a whole
(1:32:57) different whole different can of worms there um before we
(1:33:02) get go ahead before we open that can of worms I just want to let you guys know that we are at about uh an hour and 15
(1:33:09) minutes for this back and forth so I just wanted to see you know do you guys want to keep going yeah we should we should get into uh to closers here after
(1:33:17) after the final point so here I'm just going to give you one final point on this the reason I asked this question I
(1:33:22) agree that that would open up uh uh kind of a wider theological debate which maybe should be had but we're not going
(1:33:28) to be able to have it now if self-ownership and is critical to the
(1:33:34) non-aggression principle and I'm going to emphatically state that it can't even work absent the belief in self-
(1:33:40) ownership then you are in a third contradiction which is that you would
(1:33:45) stop a person who owns thems from doing whatever they wanted to themselves thus
(1:33:52) violating the property rights the very thing which you claim you want to uphold
(1:34:00) right uh yeah yeah property rights need to be upheld yeah so that's uh I would
(1:34:07) say that's a contradiction but um unless you have something you know that I just
(1:34:12) I didn't I didn't follow it just if you can do it briefly the non-aggression principle relies on you having self-
(1:34:19) ownership yes however if you're willing to violate somebody else's self-
(1:34:24) ownership by preventing them from eliminating themselves right then what you are doing is saying that they do not
(1:34:31) own themselves there's some higher Duty than just self- ownership so what you're doing is violating their right to self-
(1:34:38) ownership right but so like so libertarianism shouldn't be viewed as
(1:34:44) some religion and I think that even within libertarian literature they say like yeah like you can violate property
(1:34:49) rights if there's some kind of like higher uh moral uh quandry at stake like
(1:34:55) if if there is a uh like my my if my son was on someone else's uh property and he
(1:35:01) was an imminent danger I would trespass and violate their property rights to to to save my son right and the first of
(1:35:10) all the odds of them being that could be prescribed that could be prescribed under the emergencies of the law and not
(1:35:16) actually violate the non-aggression principle however it would always violate the non-aggression principle the
(1:35:22) second you take way that a person no longer owns thems you're now in contradiction you cannot have the
(1:35:29) non-aggression principle and not own yourself the two you can't do it how can who would you be aggressing you can't
(1:35:36) own yourself if you're dead though so if I got to stop you from killing yourself I'm not sure you yeah but you own yourself clear up until until your life
(1:35:44) is gone and who else besides you uh if you own yourself would have a right to
(1:35:50) eliminate you other than you yeah I mean again there might be something there I know we have to go to the questions
(1:35:56) again this is where I would say that I'm not a ideologically possessed libertarian if the point that you were
(1:36:02) trying to make is that I am not the perfect 100% across the board ideologically
(1:36:08) possessed point my point is is that your Christian ethics conflict with your libertarian principles and I've showed
(1:36:14) you three different examples of contradiction between the two you are yielding to higher spiritual values over
(1:36:22) the libertarianism this is because of this conflict the two cannot coexist it
(1:36:27) is impossible because your spiritual duty is to stop somebody who's about to un alive themselves and that violates
(1:36:35) their self- ownership therefore the principle of non-aggression cannot apply
(1:36:41) you are aggressing on them I I would kind of agree and I can go more in my closing statement but I would say that I just think there's a distinction between
(1:36:47) violating self- ownership to prevent someone from killing themselves and violating self- ownership to stop people
(1:36:53) who are in a gay relationship so yeah well okay all right I I'll yield to that
(1:36:58) we can get into closings um generally how this is done and closing so you know Jacob because you got to open first um
(1:37:06) and I went second I get to close last that's usually how that um that's done
(1:37:11) so um or I'm sorry the opposite right you open yeah you get to close last I'm
(1:37:16) sorry because you open first so um I can go ahead with the closing first closing arguments that I have here so I caught
(1:37:23) Jacob here um in three different massive
(1:37:29) contradictions let's go through all of them the first contradiction is that he claims that it would be a violation of
(1:37:37) the nap or the non-aggression principle to stop people from doing gay marriage
(1:37:43) for instance um or we could just kind of broadly consider this uh sexual deviancy
(1:37:49) or sexual crimes against yourself or drugs things like this crimes against yourself he says we're not supposed to
(1:37:56) be able to transgress against those people that that's not good you can't take the Civil Authority and have them
(1:38:03) go and correct this transgression against you the problem with this is
(1:38:09) that when we get to animals or things like this which would also be considered property and I give him a scenario in
(1:38:15) which the deviancy occurs his Christian ethics determine that he knows that this
(1:38:22) is beastiality there for immoral has no real problem with the Civil Authority stepping in he's not outside of any like
(1:38:28) goat humpers uh Clinic going oh we got to free him from jail because the Civil
(1:38:34) Authority put him in jail for humping a goat right he doesn't give a [ __ ] he doesn't care because he knows that the
(1:38:40) ethical standard was upheld so when the non-aggression principle applies there he kind of just goes well I I guess we
(1:38:47) just let him hump goats right but ethically he knows that that's also incorrect when it comes the next
(1:38:53) contradiction comes in when he's talking about violence itself because he can't
(1:38:58) give a definition of violence other than from a Christian worldview he expects
(1:39:04) everybody else to concede to that definition and if they don't he's going to use violence against them not even
(1:39:12) kidding not joking so the standard for the non-aggression principle from Jacob
(1:39:17) is that you should be allowed to aggress against other people who do not hold
(1:39:23) Christian ethics as their standard because they could be doing unethical things which you then need to stop but
(1:39:30) he didn't actually say why it is that they should adhere to that Christian standard only that if they don't he's
(1:39:37) going to do something about it right he will mobilize the state to stop those abortions even if half or 30% or 20% of
(1:39:45) people don't believe that this is actually conducting violence he will definitely conduct violence on them and
(1:39:52) he'll do it quick in order to enforce his standard of morality so they have to
(1:39:58) adhere to it but he never gave us an a for why they should he just kind of prattled about how different [ __ ]
(1:40:03) philosophers talk about these different scenarios and he's not really sure how it ties in exactly but because he's
(1:40:09) never really thought about it before never thought about the animals before never thought about why it is that
(1:40:14) people should uphold his ethical standard so now there was multiple contradictions here I pointed them out
(1:40:20) in real time uh it's very clear to me that the non-aggression principle and
(1:40:25) Christian ethics uh are contrary to one another because Christian ethics would
(1:40:30) move you into dutifully uh utilizing Force if necessary to stop these
(1:40:36) unethical things inside of society utilizing the Civil Authority from your standard the problem is not everybody
(1:40:43) upholds the same standard and since that is true he's just fine activating the
(1:40:48) Civil Authority for his own so the non-aggression principle really um kind of conflicts with his worldview here
(1:40:55) ultimately and then lastly we didn't really get into marriage unfortunately we were really bogged down on the rest
(1:41:00) of the libertarianism I'd actually like to come back and have that debate at some point with you down the road Jake it won't be probably for a long while
(1:41:07) because I'm always booked up but I also wanted to say that I appreciate him coming out for the debate I thought it
(1:41:13) was very spirited and very cordial um there wasn't nearly as much cutting off and things like this uh as there could
(1:41:20) have been um but I uh I ultimately appreciated it and uh with my closing
(1:41:26) I'll just say that I think that we're going to be able to move Jacob over to the dark side and abandon this
(1:41:31) libertarian Madness that he currently finds himself in because well it's
(1:41:36) stupid ultimately he wants the same thing that I want which is that there's a single Church body which essentially
(1:41:43) governs everything from his worldview and that it's monolithic and has the ultimate Authority when it comes to the
(1:41:49) use of force in a moral way so I feel like this ultimately here's what I think's going to happen I
(1:41:56) hope he's going to come to the duck site we will move him over to us with a red
(1:42:04) lightsaber right Jacob you're coming over this direction hopefully we'll be
(1:42:09) glad to have you over here with that I'll yield my time thank you very much for coming out this
(1:42:14) evening all right uh Jacob you want to take uh as much time as you need of your
(1:42:20) seven minutes for that closing statement go ahead whenever you're ready all right well first of all yeah this
(1:42:25) was a lot of fun uh going back and forth like that is is uh is yeah ideas
(1:42:30) clashing and whatnot is good and you always learn from it and you find areas where you're uh you know you need to go
(1:42:37) back and and cover some gaps in your uh in your worldview because you just haven't thought about everything yet uh
(1:42:43) I will admit that I I spent a lot more time thinking about uh I haven't thought about the the intricacies of libertarian
(1:42:49) legal theory in in in the the realm of uh goat screwing and uh uh uh
(1:42:58) necrophilia um so uh those are things that I'm I'm happy to to to go back to the drawing board and look at uh the
(1:43:05) things that Andrew pointed out that he's calling contradictions again I think this is just a a a difference in how
(1:43:13) we're describing our our our World Views and and somewhat semantics um and and I
(1:43:19) said in our little back and forth before we started this that there's going to be uh some some some push back and some
(1:43:25) tangling but there's also going to be a lot of crossover um yeah I'm a Christian first and foremost if there's anything
(1:43:31) that I believe and it comes in conflict with my Christian principles I'm not going to yield my Christian principles I
(1:43:38) am a a bonder servant of Christ I am a a soldier for his kingdom first and
(1:43:44) foremost um so uh B and the the the the use of so so then people might ask
(1:43:51) Andrew would ask well then why are you tying yourself to to libertarianism um again I think that there are important
(1:43:57) lessons from libertarian political theory that uh not only map on to
(1:44:03) Christianity but again like the the passages that I brought up in 1st Samuel 8 there there's more we could get into
(1:44:08) we didn't get into a lot of theology was more philosophy which is fine um but I think that there are uh if we believe in
(1:44:15) following Christian ethics and Christian morality and even the idea of Christian governance which I'm not against the
(1:44:20) idea of governance is going to exist um and in so far as governance will
(1:44:26) exist I would prefer the governance be filled with Christians and enforcing Christian morality has to enforce
(1:44:32) something can it's either going going to enforce Christian morality or or it will
(1:44:38) enforce some other kind of morality and I I do reject the idea that there can be just a new a neutral culture where it's
(1:44:45) just completely diverse and everyone's like no there's going to be a a a dominant culture and I do want that you
(1:44:51) know ultimately that to be Christian I want my world view to to win so I'm not going to sh away from that either but I
(1:44:57) think that uh in so far as I want my world view to win I think that there are
(1:45:03) uh moral imperatives moral commands that's where morality comes from it comes from God and his commands that
(1:45:09) there are commands that place obligations upon Christians and I think one of them is that we are obligated to
(1:45:15) not commit aggression uh against those who have not committed aggression and
(1:45:20) who defines aggression I think the that God defined aggression Through the Bible through his word um and even through
(1:45:27) church tradition and so um uh and I again we could get into that I think
(1:45:33) that there are uh different Christian theologians historians um uh Church
(1:45:39) fathers who who agreed with my view of the state that ultimately uh it is a somewhat of a zero sum game between the
(1:45:45) kingdoms of man and the kingdom of God uh you cannot serve two masters uh one of the one of the horrible doctrines
(1:45:52) that came out of Protestant theology is the two Kingdom Theology of Luther which I just I I can't stand um and I I think
(1:46:00) that we have to live for the kingdom of God first and we need to be uh So within within my reformed circles are more of a
(1:46:06) kyion I think we need to be reclaiming culture reclaiming institutions for Christ and and but that means that we
(1:46:12) have to the the current power structures that exist we need to recognize the incentive structures of of them that
(1:46:19) they uh ultimately will be drawn towards this is what um what's my time by the way you
(1:46:25) two three okay um just to uh to quote haa again I I recommend everyone read
(1:46:31) haa like uh getting libertarianism right the Democracy The God That Failed haa is one of the the best libertarian thinkers
(1:46:38) who understood there need to be a fusion I think between Christian conservatives Christian conservatism and and
(1:46:44) libertarianism um and haa gets a lot of crap from Libertarians and I do too so I'm not um the uh but yeah the idea that
(1:46:53) uh the incentive structure of state power is ultimately that it is going to
(1:46:58) promote that which is High Time preference because that is what once you're in power you are not just
(1:47:04) concerned with using that power to advance your worldview you have to be concerned with holding on to that power
(1:47:09) and when you once you have given a monopoly of force to people that they can conscript people that they can uh
(1:47:15) take property from them that they can uh have a monopoly of Law and initiate Force against them those uh po those
(1:47:24) rights or Powers you've given to that Monopoly are are going to attract others who want to use that power to then uh on
(1:47:32) their behalf and this is how you get what we have today which is we essentially have it's not a free market
(1:47:37) Society not a free market economy it's a uh you know a indirect command economy what we have right now is very close to
(1:47:44) Fascism in which the the market in so far as it exists is subservient to the
(1:47:49) state we saw this during lockdowns corporations were willing to uh kiss the ass of whatever the state
(1:47:55) bureaucrats told them to do they couldn't they couldn't do it quick enough uh because once you have power then power becomes for sale and it goes
(1:48:02) to the highest bidder and then uh it feeds into itself and they're going to promote the high time preference
(1:48:09) behaviors the degeneracy because that's good for them because if people are distracted by numbing themselves in this
(1:48:17) uh very hedonistic very uh self-indulgent way that our culture does
(1:48:22) they're too distracted to notice that they've been enslaved by by by the state apparatus that they essentially exist as
(1:48:29) tax cattle as as as the working class to uphold this ruling class so uh that is
(1:48:36) where I think libertarianism has important insights that Christians need to wrestle with again I think uh
(1:48:43) Christians and conservatives need to learn a Libertarian lesson and I think Libertarians need to learn a conservative uh uh lesson as well so um
(1:48:53) so yeah and if so the things that I'll end on this the things that Andrew said these are contradictions it's like sure
(1:49:01) like to some Libertarians these are contradictions I don't really care about like being some ideologically pure
(1:49:07) libertarian as defined by like the absurdities of of non-Christian Libertarians I am a Christian and I
(1:49:15) think that libertarianism has a lot of valuable insights uh and with that I'll yield my time all right appreciate it
(1:49:21) the dark side is coming for you by the way uh we we will move into the call-in section Kyle if you don't mind I've got
(1:49:28) him in the background I don't know do you did we give you the permissions to pull callers in and out or do we still
(1:49:34) need to do that okay we'll get that all taken care of for you dude uh Jam you've been waiting patiently in the background
(1:49:39) go ahead when you're ready hello Andrew and Jacob and Kyle
(1:49:44) can you guys hear me I can hear you how you doing jeam long time no talk yeah I'm doing great thanks by the way I've
(1:49:50) been reading your been reading your great book um so it's actually it's fantastic um I've got it on my
(1:49:56) nightstand right now I got halfway through it last night so it's a good read that's awesome I'm I'm really glad
(1:50:02) to hear that um so the the question I have for is g to be for Jacob uh am I
(1:50:08) allowed to like ask one question and then do a followup because yeah you can yep okay so Jacob uh do you worship the
(1:50:17) the you're you're Christian libertarian if I understand correctly correct
(1:50:22) uh I'm a Christian and I I I think that libertarian political philosophy is is is largely correct but I mean I don't go
(1:50:30) around saying I'm a Christian libertarian like I'm I'm a Christian clarify that okay well do you
(1:50:38) worship the the god of the Bible or the god of Plato uh I worship the god of the Bible
(1:50:45) okay uh the god of the Bible violates the uh non-aggression principle all the
(1:50:50) time um how how exactly is there a problem if people die why why is there a bad thing if we kill people right so uh
(1:50:58) you you're confusing horizontal and vertical relationships um so yeah in the vertical sense uh we are uh subservient
(1:51:06) to God and I think God is like the ultimate o owner and decider of everything that happens um we're also
(1:51:12) Sinners and so we as Christians from the Christian worldview believe that God would be just in just wiping the Slate
(1:51:19) clean at any moment and saying you know you're you're all all deserve hell the pen the the wages of sin is death and
(1:51:25) off you go um it's and what makes the gospel message so um impactful and
(1:51:31) amazing is that Jacob I don't mean to I don't mean to cut in just remember with the callers we want to keep keep the back and forth super concise okay right
(1:51:38) so uh yeah the gospel message is we we got Grace and we didn't deserve it so God's allowed to execute judgment but as
(1:51:45) Romans 12 says vengeance is mine says the Lord and so there's a difference between what we're allowed to do what
(1:51:51) God's allowed to do because God and man are different so you're confusing what's allowed on the horizontal vertical no I
(1:51:57) agree that God can do things that we don't have to do God doesn't have to atone for himself obviously but uh God
(1:52:03) can give orders to people who follow his religion to kill other people you know you do know that St Paul punishes people
(1:52:09) for blasphemy right um I I'd want to know a a citation
(1:52:14) for for that Timothy 1 Timothy 1:20 and 1 and 1 Corinthians 5:13 he delivers
(1:52:20) people to Satan is the exact quote for their blasphemy is he not allowed to do that is that being too
(1:52:26) aggressive I I'd have to I'd have to look into that more I haven't uh encountered those passages I don't know
(1:52:31) what the Blas let me ask another one real that's okay you don't have to know every single verse let me ask another one real quick and then I'll I'll give a
(1:52:37) chance for other people to pop in um do you think the morality that Jesus Christ teaches is different from the morality
(1:52:43) of the Old Testament particularly in the uh Covenant of Sinai Moses yeah so I got
(1:52:48) into this a little bit my intro uh and I I've it's hard to condem this but I think that the the Mosaic Covenant was
(1:52:55) the term is an eschatological intrusion and so I think that there were was like a suspension of normal play of natural
(1:53:01) law which I know Andrew doesn't agree with but NE so I so I uh that's fine um
(1:53:06) but yeah I think that there were a different set of rules that play for the The Saga of ancient Israel within the
(1:53:12) Mosaic Covenant okay so I'm trying to keep this Snappy because Andrew said we don't to have too many long answers uh
(1:53:18) so you're basically saying that Jesus said to love our enemies but you they weren't doing that in the time of Moses
(1:53:24) if I'm understanding what you're saying correctly um well so Justice can
(1:53:30) sometimes be loving and I think that part of that eschatological intrusion and this is said in the Bible that he was delivering Justice to the Canaanites
(1:53:38) but he also did say that at one point well we're not he told the Israelites you're not going into the promised land
(1:53:43) yet because their sin is not yet you know reached its fulfillment so you know within the natural Grace order God gives
(1:53:49) people and Nations a chance to repent but then he also has the prerogative to give a direct command to go execute his
(1:53:56) judgment but he's given no such command for anybody today well I'm going to leave you two little thoughts here and then I'll leave time for other people to
(1:54:02) pop in number one in Deuteronomy chapter 18 God punishes the Canaanites for not adhering to the law of Moses even though
(1:54:08) they never heard of it so that's not exactly giving them a fair chance but they still get punished for it no matter
(1:54:13) what proof of natural law by the way but no that's not proof of of natural law
(1:54:18) and natural theology or perennialism there's a difference between there being the OB Ive standard that God bears and
(1:54:24) forces into the world versus saying all religions have the same exact kind of Truth secondly I was just going to say
(1:54:30) that uh when Jesus Christ says to love your enemies he's actually quoting the Old Testament so if Moses and Solomon
(1:54:36) who both say love your enemies love their enemies yet they still decapitate people I think it's perfectly in line to
(1:54:42) have a militaristic arm of Christianity to enforce morality in the world I don't see any contradiction with that in the
(1:54:48) New Testament and I can't find any real pacifism in the New Testament either I'm not a pass I appreciate the uh the
(1:54:55) call in have yourself a wonderful night again go by Jam's book uh I'll put it in the link if you send it over to me Jam
(1:55:02) it's quite good I enjoyed it uh you should read it as well Jacob in fact in the spirit of good sportsmanship I'll
(1:55:08) send you a copy on me awesome all right thanks and yep take care jeam sorry I
(1:55:13) had to cut you off there grid One Motorsports been waiting patiently in the background go ahead when you're ready I have been waiting patiently um I
(1:55:21) have an echo for some reason is it is it better no you're fine there's no Echo Oh
(1:55:28) weird I got have an echo on my end that's okay I can deal with it um Jacob I I I've listened uh to this it's been
(1:55:34) really pretty good um and actually I a lot of what I've was going to say has already actually been said by Jim um how
(1:55:42) do you reconcile that that throughout the biblical sense and and throughout
(1:55:48) time um the only way that we've actually been able to enforce any sort of lasting
(1:55:53) peace has been through the use of force the threat of force and the existence of
(1:55:58) that Force how do you resolve that with what your libertarian Viewpoint is yeah
(1:56:04) again I think that this this is a a confusion that some people think that libertarianism or Christian
(1:56:10) libertarianism is pacifism that that there's no like there is a just use of force and I tried to make this very
(1:56:15) clear in my intro uh the Bible is very clear that that that governing authorities are established by God to
(1:56:21) enforce is good but I think that's limited to a civil sense I think that because God uh because God is Sovereign
(1:56:28) and his authority is uh is Ultimate any Authority he delegates is limited and can only be used to what is specifically
(1:56:35) prescribed uh by the way I raised your audio up on this in Grid one so people can hear you go ahead oh I yeah I'm
(1:56:41) sorry I had it turned down um okay well still you just seem to have
(1:56:48) this like even though you keep claiming that you're not a pacifist you keep saying pacifist things can you give me
(1:56:55) an example of a pacifist thing I've said pacifism would say that if someone harms you you can't defend yourself I'm I'm
(1:57:01) totally for self-defense I'm totally for the adjudication of property rights uh I'm even for a just War Theory so I
(1:57:09) you're I didn't hear you say that you were for a just War Theory I a matter of fact that I mean I think that so if you
(1:57:15) understand the doctrine of just War Theory it's pretty stringent you have to exhaust all options for peace under just War Theory uh but yeah if you exhaust
(1:57:21) all options for peace and you have to go to war that's an extension of if individuals have a right to self-defense
(1:57:26) then a group of individuals can also have a right to self-defense okay
(1:57:32) so the only thing libertarianism is rejecting and I think that is consistent with Biblical principles is that that is
(1:57:38) the initiation of violence against nonviolent people we got to we got to wrap the call guys we have like nine we
(1:57:43) have nine people in the background of grid your last thoughts here bro uh I just it just seems like that you are
(1:57:50) ignoring the fact that government's um and I like Andrew's uh philosophy of
(1:57:56) government does need to have that Force con Continuum regardless and I think you
(1:58:03) ignore that and you just kind of wave it away but maybe I'm wrong I could be wrong I've been wrong before by the way
(1:58:09) uh grid one I would highly recommend Jacob for your channel um he he does he does a lot of um Regular discussions
(1:58:16) rather than debates I noticed on his channel a very good faith guy I'd recommend that you have him on anyway
(1:58:22) have a good night man you take care guys I see all of you in the call Que in the
(1:58:27) back I'm just going in the order in which it was received except for this one which is Chase Haggard because Chase
(1:58:34) Haggard does control the entire Ortho bro sphere he pulls all the strings in the background nobody knows that he is
(1:58:40) the true Dark Lord but he is go ahead Chase when you're ready thank you for that Andrew you can have a cigarette um
(1:58:47) so uh Jacob I wanted to uh I wanted to ask you I know that Andrew went through that example about um you know say a
(1:58:54) land owner where water ran through and if the land owner were to say no I'm just going to block all trade and water coming through to other people you said
(1:59:01) that you would want to go and um you know reason with this person right if they had H Homestead I think I
(1:59:09) think uh you know it's reasonable to to first try to you know find Peaceable Solutions talking things out and then
(1:59:15) you make further escalations from there as as necessary cool okay and you're uh
(1:59:21) you said that you're form so you believe in total depravity yes okay and these people
(1:59:26) could be totally depraved and theologically because of your theology have no ability to actually reason
(1:59:32) correctly in a Godly way well the the reformed view would be that although people are totally depraved that the
(1:59:38) meaning of that is total inability means the ability to save themselves doesn't mean that they're evil as they could be
(1:59:44) uh at all possible times and and or that they can't restrain any of their sinful
(1:59:50) um desires at all that so that that that wouldn't be part of reformed theology yeah so but again it's going to
(1:59:56) be that they are deficient in their ability to go and choose God think about why God hardened
(2:00:03) Pharaoh's heart like because the Comm that's an expression he didn't actually that's I'm Orthodox I don't believe in
(2:00:08) uh secondary causation people not being able to you know choose to participate with God's will because that would make
(2:00:14) God a monster but my critique is that you're appealing to these people being able to reason when they could all just
(2:00:20) be totally depraved and you could be totally depraved in thinking that libertarian theology is correct or sorry
(2:00:27) libertarian uh political theory is correct and you could just be totally depraved so so I'll give a quick answer
(2:00:33) here if your view is correct this doesn't seem to be a problem if if if reformed theology is wrong if if reform
(2:00:38) theology is right then the view is that uh God actively restrains the evil in
(2:00:44) the hearts of man and also that often times people will act in their own rational self-interest even if they are
(2:00:50) depraved because they know uh and this so the reformed apologetic on God hardening Pharaoh's heart is that he did
(2:00:55) it because he knew Pharaoh would just let the Israelites go to save himself so
(2:01:00) that's not answering my question uh can you repeat the question
(2:01:05) quick my my question was again about you appealing to people's ability to go and
(2:01:11) would they would happily reason with you in this libertarian way to go I'm not
(2:01:16) saying they would necessarily I'm not I'm not I'm not creating a utopian premise that like automatically
(2:01:22) necessarily would and I've also said that libertarian ideas work best in a a
(2:01:28) culture that's Christian um I think that the less Christian culture is the more authoritarian it will be yeah but we
(2:01:34) can't even make a Christian culture because we don't have control over God's secret decree to go and make subsume
(2:01:41) people with God's irresistible Grace so what's the point of even trying to make Christians yeah well that that's diving into a whole different whole different
(2:01:49) argumentation from there of course if you want to set up a debate Chase you're always welcome
(2:01:56) on The Crucible as the dark lord of the ortho Bros appreciate your call in have a good one Jacob thank you yeah thanks
(2:02:01) for the questions okay so there's a bunch of callers in the background who do not have their cams on if you're not
(2:02:07) a person who I recognize uh all I need you to do is turn your cam on quickly and give a little wave if you could do
(2:02:13) that I see you garbage I see not your dude um anybody else back there I you
(2:02:20) obviously you understand why have to do that uh Jim Bob you've been waiting patiently in the background go ahead
(2:02:26) with your questions garbage I'll get to you next followed by not your dude go ahead Jim Bob uh Jacob uh would you say
(2:02:33) um erecting a building of any sort would be an act of
(2:02:38) aggression I would need more context if I erect a building on someone else's property that could be an act no on your
(2:02:43) own your own property no okay let's say your property is in the midst of a
(2:02:48) public Arena well I say like normative no I mean again we can we can ex we can like
(2:02:54) if I built a a really tall building that wasn't structurally sound and then it like fell over and damage someone else's
(2:03:00) property how about how about a structurally sound perfect highest uh highest degree carpenters and and uh
(2:03:07) contractors and Architects get together and erect a building that looks I don't know identically to a large
(2:03:14) dick in a p in the public space do we use aggression to make sure that doesn't
(2:03:20) uh uh doesn't happen or can they just make their building yeah so the uh the libertarian
(2:03:29) way of dealing with that is usually through contract law if you have a community where people are living close to each other they typically have uh you
(2:03:35) know and there's different ways to do this they can individually contract or sometimes they'll have uh like
(2:03:41) corporations that will uh act as dispute uh resol uh dispute resolution
(2:03:47) organizations uh this is getting to like private law theory which is like a rothbard uh Anar capitalist idea which I think is
(2:03:54) logically consistent however I'm not a Libertarian purist so what I've often said is that my My ultimate goal is to
(2:04:02) decentralize power as much as is practical very concise very concise bro very uh short answer would be uh yeah at
(2:04:10) the local level I'm okay with stopping people from erting penis houses that's
(2:04:16) great okay thank you Jim Bob for the call in
(2:04:22) uh garbage you've been waiting patiently in the background I'm bringing you up uh now guys all I need you to do I so did
(2:04:29) see not your dude cammed up uh Dan man I'd like to bring you on you've been waiting patiently if you could just turn the camera on give me a wave that's
(2:04:36) that's all I need you to do um go ahead garbage when you're ready hello uh how's
(2:04:42) everybody doing tonight good how are you it was great great debate um my question
(2:04:47) to Jacob is well cheers to you garbage cheers to a nice shot of vodka
(2:04:52) Down the Hatch so you brought up you've brought up force a lot sir um how do you define
(2:05:02) force uh force would be uh the
(2:05:08) uh the the use of coion when you when you are compelling somebody to do
(2:05:13) something um you know like I mean obviously doesn't have to be coercion
(2:05:20) right different types of force um but yeah I mean force would be generally like you
(2:05:25) using some kind of like physical action if you want to take a second to pull up the definition that's actually okay I
(2:05:30) recommend that you do so right because it's semantic if you have one that you agree
(2:05:37) with um I mean I guess like so there's probably like technical legal
(2:05:43) e definitions of force which okay so but but what's strength or energy as an attribute of a physical action or
(2:05:50) movement does that sound reasonable yeah sure it works okay so my question is
(2:05:55) more specifically on uh subterfuge whereas whereas where you believe you can't take things by force
(2:06:02) how do you parse that with uh for example propaganda whereas a group
(2:06:08) spends a lot of money or spends a lot of time arguing one or two things is that
(2:06:13) not a force that we as Christians should be opposed
(2:06:20) to yeah I don't know if I quite so so you're saying if if there are people who
(2:06:26) are putting out propaganda and they're spreading harmful lies is that an act of aggression in order to get elected to
(2:06:32) spread an agenda maybe to sell drugs even you could take it to a Physical Realm where there's they're they're
(2:06:38) selling drugs in order to in or perhaps advocating that you can take as many drugs as you want yes
(2:06:45) sir that that could be propaganda right so there there's part of there's part of part of legal theory that would
(2:06:52) uh perhaps hold people accountable for spreading like really harmful misinformation or like false advertising
(2:06:58) perhaps if it leads to direct harm but that wouldn't it wouldn't be like a black and white thing there's a lot of nuance there well I'm I'm more attacking
(2:07:05) it from a religious perspective because I've heard you mention about uh the the Christian ethos not not not meeting
(2:07:11) force with Force unless it's an equal situation What in then if you agree that
(2:07:18) Force could be propaganda or things of that nature how do we attack that as
(2:07:23) Christians in your worldview I I don't know if I said that
(2:07:29) uh I mean I guess like prop so propaganda could be uh Force if it's really again like
(2:07:36) like some kind of like it's you can demonstrate some direct harm some kind of like false adver telling people that
(2:07:42) they can take as many drugs as they want and you're not going to stop them like that um Jacob if you if you were like
(2:07:49) the owner of a company what about a politician running on the decriminalization of drugs for example
(2:07:56) would that would that not be a a a force that Christians should
(2:08:02) oppose no they shouldn't oppose that no I I don't think I think the War on Drugs
(2:08:08) has been a massive failure I don't think that using Force to stop people from putting substances in their body is a
(2:08:14) Christian principle and I also don't think it's very uh very prudent either um and and rather what we have is like
(2:08:20) the world's largest prison population and it costs a lot of tax money and actually stop [ __ ] selling drugs
(2:08:29) huh create a moral if Force could create a moral people that would be great but
(2:08:34) that was going to be my followup if I had time was if you were not going to attack the user then how do you feel
(2:08:39) about the one who sells it like they would be held is that not also
(2:08:45) a force to fight against as a Christian so so this actually appeals to the libertarian worldview very well because
(2:08:52) what governments often do is they get lobbied to by these companies that where they don't have to be very open and
(2:08:58) transparent about the negative side effects of certain things orace whereas where than a free market
(2:09:04) that would be I'd actually think that'd be much harder so okay caller I have to leave it there thank you so much for the call in have a great day uh not your
(2:09:12) dude go ahead when you're ready hey can you hear me I can hear you all right so
(2:09:18) uh Jacob you have a high belief in the reality of the om of God right yeah
(2:09:23) absolutely all right right on so you would agree that this kingdom is ultimately fulfilled at the second
(2:09:29) coming where everyone utterly submits to unified governance under Christ and also worships him in a unified
(2:09:36) Church yeah I mean the kingdom of God it's kind of described as an already not yet sort of thing so it it already
(2:09:42) exists um and and is uh I think our job as Christians to help uh like the Lord's
(2:09:49) Prayer on Heaven as it is on Earth um but I don't think that is done through the sword I don't think the primary
(2:09:55) means of spreading or uh growing the kingdom of God is through initiate right right right I'm not I'm not trying to
(2:10:01) touch on Force necessarily right now I'm just saying that that is the ultimate fulfillment of the kingdom of God right
(2:10:08) like you're right it's also here and now every will bow every tongue will
(2:10:13) confess yeah exactly so like he would be like our unified ruler we all submit to
(2:10:19) him and we all worship Him in one Church so considering that's the way that
(2:10:24) governance is fulfilled in the future like in the escaton why is this a satisfactory uh
(2:10:30) future for you to look forward to as a Christian considering that your ideal Society in the Here and Now is kind of
(2:10:36) more interested in being governed by libertarianism rather than the law of God God well one I think that's
(2:10:42) prescribed I don't think we're prescribed to have some kind of One World Christian government right now before the culmination of the age and
(2:10:49) two I trust God to be the ultimate ruler with ultimate Authority I don't trust any man or institution to do that but
(2:10:56) you would prefer that the institutions are stocked with moral Christian men correct well yeah I mean because the
(2:11:03) alternative is a man capable of properly following God and serving their government or not they're they're
(2:11:08) they're better off doing so in a decentralized fashion when power is overly centralized even Christian men
(2:11:14) often find themselves either in the positions where they cannot properly fight against the incentives of power or
(2:11:19) they be themselves become corrupted tempted by it agreed everyone's capable
(2:11:24) of tempation well they might start [ __ ] goats right and if they do well I mean we
(2:11:31) can't stop him I mean that would just be out of bounds right anyway not your dude
(2:11:37) uh sorry we have to cut the call short I have to move on to the next caller appreciate your calling have yourself a
(2:11:43) wonderful evening uh Corinth you've been waiting patiently go ahead when you're ready uh yeah Jacob do you have an issue
(2:11:49) with centralized Christian power
(2:11:54) I that to me it's like that that what does that mean because Andrew and I had this back and forth right like if you're
(2:11:59) talking like in power that's only actualizing on Christian ethics uh it
(2:12:05) depends on the scale and scope the location at all powerful they're the world government that's running just
(2:12:11) Christian ethics um if it's in the escaton I wouldn't have a problem with it if it's
(2:12:17) in the here and now I I don't think that I think it's even a nonse I don't think before the escaton we could have a one
(2:12:22) world government that is Christian assuming you could to the heart of the questioning yeah so if that's the heart
(2:12:28) of the question if that is I missed it if that's the heart of the question then sure but like I I don't know it seems like a toy like if we could have a
(2:12:34) perfect world would I want a perfect world I'm not sure that that would be a perfect world just because it's run uh
(2:12:40) monolithically by a Christian centralized government um that means
(2:12:47) Perfection uh if if it's run I maybe I Mard the the parameters of the question I thought he said if we had a world that
(2:12:54) was run entirely by One World Christian government they were all acting as good
(2:13:00) Christians yeah so like Banning gay marriage you know to like get gay married all those things like there's no
(2:13:06) amount of community agreement well then then then we would just disagree over what it means to be good because I again this is I I
(2:13:13) don't think marriage is like something that's okay chisan do you think homosexuality is something that's good
(2:13:18) or bad in Christianity homosexuality is bad we need to divor marriage from
(2:13:23) CHR bad things or a good Christian going to not allow bad things uh uh good
(2:13:30) Christians are going to allow certain bad things to happen because we're not called to use Force against all sin and
(2:13:36) if you justification for where God said yeah let the gay people be gay because I remember a certain verse about stoning
(2:13:42) them to death personally that was in that was that was in the uh Mosaic Covenant yeah so is there any point
(2:13:49) where that's contradicted is the word of God changing yeah I mean it sounds like
(2:13:55) you're making a basic theonomist argument and I don't have time to really debunk that right now I mean you have to
(2:14:00) understand how the covenants work and and understand that there was a New Covenant the New Covenant did not
(2:14:06) promote homosexuality at all and gave no prescription in marriage for
(2:14:12) homosexuality it gave no prescription ever for it it also never said that you shouldn't follow former Leviticus law
(2:14:21) uh there's plenty of instances where the the the apostles agreed that the the old Covenant laws were were were no longer
(2:14:27) binding can you show any of them I don't I don't have have them on hand this
(2:14:32) explicitly just incorrect Jesus explicitly stated that he came to not
(2:14:37) change the laws but to fulfill the prophecies like maybe you're just not a good Christian in this case no this is
(2:14:45) just a misunderstanding of covenant theology I I can answer if I if I was
(2:14:50) able by covenant theology just mean incorrect theology then yeah it's an
(2:14:55) Corinth we have to we have to move to the next caller hey thank you for the call in I really appreciate it um
(2:15:01) coren's an evil Progressive too man like he's an evil Progressive and that that
(2:15:07) that surprised me but I guess maybe he just likes internal critiques um going by order uh Dan man I do want to let you
(2:15:14) in but you you got to turn your camera on in the background so I can see you for just a second um that's all I'm asking for okay
(2:15:21) okay great okay so I'm going to add you up Dan man go ahead when you're ready oh thank you thank you for having me on um
(2:15:27) my question is for Jacob because I used to be a former libertarian um one of the things that kind of puzzled me in libertarianism and
(2:15:33) I don't know maybe you have a better answer than I than I could but um you know un assuming that you know Market is
(2:15:41) um Superior than the government uh why hasn't the market abolished the use of
(2:15:49) force why hasn't the well well hold on there is a just use of force again this is this is conflating libertarianism
(2:15:55) with pacifism yeah but but the heart of his question is if the market truly is
(2:16:00) superior than than uh these other systems which rely on I never said the market I never said the market is
(2:16:06) perfect so like uh violence and coercion can win out against free market so this
(2:16:12) is again the difference between descriptive and prescriptive there is defining what is morally normative and
(2:16:17) what we should try to move towards and then there is descriptive in terms of that uh Force often does win against uh
(2:16:25) non-force but what kind ofle sorry hypothetically Jeff Bezos decides to create his own Army uh Market
(2:16:33) you know they they're using free market principles they create the best Weaponry can they not overcome I mean and even to
(2:16:40) this point some corporations have actually more money than some governments and standing armies they
(2:16:47) there's a there is a point where a corporation basically essentially becomes a its own government or own
(2:16:53) state of sorts but if the this just kind of comes down to the uh the most of the
(2:16:59) arguments against libertarianism or descriptions of the status quo it's like you're saying well if we don't have a government that's going to have a giant
(2:17:05) army that can oppress people then how then we might end up with a a government with a giant army that could impress
(2:17:11) people it's like yeah these things can happen but we should be doing what we can to construct Society in a way that
(2:17:18) that that minimizes these problems yeah you see that's the thing cuz eventually what would happen is another creation
(2:17:24) even though it would be from let's say Jeff Bezos right he would just create a new government in a way that he wants it
(2:17:29) to be run right so there's no it's just kind of circular to me well again this is why so so even though I think that's
(2:17:36) not a great critique of libertarianism I will say that the problem you're describing is why Christianity is so
(2:17:42) important because without that if you just have a a secular degenerate people
(2:17:47) then yeah with they're uh they're unconstrained un uh Sanctified Natures
(2:17:53) will tend towards more violence and more uh corruption and more centralized power
(2:17:59) all right Dam man Dam man I'm sorry Dam man we got to leave it there bro thank you so much for the call in though I really appreciate it I understand
(2:18:05) callers can become frustrated because they feel like they can't get into the heart of it just try to understand we
(2:18:10) have these time constrictions for a reason uh both Jacob and callers I would request that you keep it super short and
(2:18:17) as concise as you can so you get your points out mjap POS go ahead when you're ready hey how's it going can you guys
(2:18:23) hear me we can hear you go ahead okay I'll keep it short yeah so uh Jacob
(2:18:29) hypothetically under your libertarian Christian frame framework unfortunately
(2:18:34) it seems to me that you've cornered yourself ideologically so my hypothetical would be under your libertarian framework
(2:18:43) let's say if a certain religion were to come to the Forefront and become the majority in the US uh a religion a
(2:18:51) certain religion that is diametrically opposed to Christianity and that may want to take out certain
(2:18:57) apostates uh what would be your duty under your Christian side of you your framework to actually act against that
(2:19:04) if ever do you have a duty to act against that just to sorry there was a lot so if
(2:19:10) we lived under a regime that was like initiating violence against Christians I
(2:19:16) didn't even make that claim yet I'm just saying if this certain religion let's say muslim okay if they came to the
(2:19:21) majority through your libertarian framework in the US they're doing only what you're asking them to do to
(2:19:26) maximize their freedom and their Liberty if they if they become the majority what is your duty as a Christian to act
(2:19:33) against that or do you have any duty at all to act against that um if we had a Muslim majority I
(2:19:41) guess it would depend on what the Muslim majority does um I would say that our duty is to always be uh trying to win
(2:19:48) people over to the kingdom to be Fishers of Men so if we lived in a doesn't matter what if if we're not the no
(2:19:53) matter what even if we're the majority they're still going to be unsaved so let's try to save as many as we can and if you sound like you're a bit of a
(2:20:00) consequentialist then or you outcome based ideology here it why would it matter what the outcome is if the
(2:20:06) majority becomes Muslim it should be it should bother you if you're a Christian yes there's hold on first of
(2:20:14) all there are State societies that end up with majority Muslim so you can have a majority Muslim happen in any context
(2:20:20) if that happens Christians should always be trying to win anyone that they encounter over for Christ regardless of
(2:20:26) what political system they find themselves in yeah but what's your claim they're only doing what you wanted them to
(2:20:33) do well you're you're conflating the the Civil sphere with the with the religious sphere and I I I'd be more specific but
(2:20:39) I I it would take like three minutes to answer your question properly but you're you're confusing the spere let's uh let's wrap it up then very quickly I'm J
(2:20:46) toose I'm going to give you the last word make it super quick please yeah just like I said earlier you've cornered
(2:20:51) yourself you cornered yourself ideologically these two things cannot be one and the same it's oil and water and that's all I'm going to say about it
(2:20:58) okay thank you MJ depose I appreciate it Southern presy uh real quick this nobody's going to see this by the way
(2:21:04) you're in the background can you just turn that cam on one more time and wave at me just want to make sure just very
(2:21:10) quickly I know that there's a bit of a delay there you go you can turn it right back off dude there you go you're all
(2:21:16) good go ahead when you're ready Southern Presby hey what's up so my question is for you Jacob um you said that you're
(2:21:24) reformed so then I would understand I I would take it that you understand reformed history of the terms of you
(2:21:29) know like uh reformed confessions so my question for you would have to be this
(2:21:34) um what if false gospels right if the soul is eternal and false gospels
(2:21:40) essentially kill the soul eternally uh how is that not violence and how is state power not justified to suppress
(2:21:47) that uh again I think we're confusing spheres um the the the the law the sphere of civil
(2:21:53) governance is to deal with civil matters is to deal with with what happens in the realm of of what is legally normative um
(2:22:00) and the church is to deal with spiritual matters and I'm trying to be as concise as I can i' love to I'll try to be
(2:22:07) concise too so every reformer uh you know to include basa and Calvin themselves uh disagreed with you and
(2:22:14) said that because of that the state you know has a incentive even though in you
(2:22:19) know they you're right I disagree with Calvin I take I I I disagree with Calvin
(2:22:24) I take more of a neoc calvinist Kyan approach interesting so then the entire
(2:22:31) history of the Reformed Church is wrong and your modern Fusion of libertarianism
(2:22:37) is right um well I mean first of all I mean compared to it's always compared to what
(2:22:43) right like I mean like like first of all I have problems with protestantism so I have problems with Calvin I don't think
(2:22:48) any of these people have gotten it uh 100% correct so I mean all right Southern Southern I'm
(2:22:55) sorry I'm sorry bro I'd love to get into more but it's just I know I know I know listen I understand call frustration
(2:23:01) thank you Southern Presbyterian for calling in Casmir you look rather annoyed I see you in the background can
(2:23:07) you just hang tight for a second I'm going to give you plenty of time thus far it's mostly just been poor Jacob
(2:23:13) getting mogged by collars I know that you're going to come in with a different point of view I'm going to give you tons of time to speak just hang tight me
(2:23:20) brother okay all right all right I got I got the hands up from him Adam Dole go ahead when you're ready hey um Jacob can
(2:23:27) you point to a time in history where they're barring an extreme social
(2:23:33) Calamity like a revolution a war or complete social collapse where you've seen a decentralization of
(2:23:41) power ah there are other Libertarians that are uh better at describing whether
(2:23:47) there's been periods of time and in in a world history where there's been you know quasi libertarian societies I'd say
(2:23:55) if if you believe in the Bible the Book of Judges is a you know a sort of like uh Theocratic Confederacy of sorts so
(2:24:02) there are examples question I'm I'm not asking have decentralized societies exist I've read the I've read the work
(2:24:09) dealing with medieval Iceland I'm familiar with that theory I'm asking you a time because even in medieval Iceland
(2:24:14) you saw a concentration of power I'm asking you can you point to a non-extreme social change that led to a
(2:24:21) decentralization as opposed to a centralization of power because spoiler it doesn't happen that isn't how it
(2:24:27) works but if you have any say it
(2:24:32) um without I mean I guess it just depends on how you're defining a major social upheaval um I mean uh yeah C
(2:24:41) decentralizing uh yeah that's tough but lots of people are killed by centralizing power too so it seems like
(2:24:47) we have a dilemma either way and we need to think about long-term comes and tradeoffs well yeah so basically you're
(2:24:53) advocating for an extreme social Calamity is my point um you and you
(2:24:59) basically just no that is not bad that no that's exactly what you just said you appealed
(2:25:04) to long-term outcomes you said we have to not think about short term we got think about long
(2:25:10) term you have to understand that there are two sides of The Ledger here that yes there can be costs to both like life
(2:25:17) and also social upheaval to trying to de centralized power but there is current and ongoing and escalating loss of life
(2:25:24) and social upheaval by allowing and continuing the central centralization of power so you have to you have to
(2:25:31) actually weigh those two things against each other yeah so um my well my basic
(2:25:37) claim is that power tends to centralize you're advocating for something that doesn't happen historically if you're
(2:25:42) not advocating for major social upheavals for the decentralization of power this is utterly a historical
(2:25:47) nonsense that you're promoting okay Adam I got got to let this go here I'm going to let Jacob respond real quick while
(2:25:53) you're still on the line though go ahead Jacob uh I think the social AAL I'm
(2:25:58) advocating for is Christian nationalism I'll just leave it at that I mean that's pretty epic Adam Dole
(2:26:06) thank you for the call I really truly appr have yourself a wonderful night
(2:26:11) Casmir I seen you back there seething this whole time but real quick it's
(2:26:16) great to see you my friend how you been um I'm doing great can you hear me fine yeah I can you look exhausted you've
(2:26:22) been working your ass off haven't you yeah I have yeah I've been working your ass off you look you have that look you
(2:26:28) have that I just got done with a [ __ ] 9h hour shift and here I am on the damn Cru that's what you look like right now
(2:26:34) brother but anyway go ahead when I enjoyed myself I I like uh listening to
(2:26:40) all the little doggies call in and uh uh and advocate for their own enslavement
(2:26:45) it it you know it's fairly normal in society and and I know that people are
(2:26:51) very I sort of I don't expect much of people I don't expect them to be educated on their history on their own
(2:26:57) history you've been some my exes haven't you Casmir uh no I don't think we've met
(2:27:02) before okay but we should we should talk someday you can watch one of my streams to see if kmir is you can consider him
(2:27:10) my libertarian adversary he is Andrew Wilson in pure libertarian form I
(2:27:16) consider him I consider him to be quite brilliant and I often yield to what he
(2:27:22) has to say on this subject because um I've just never met a smarter man on the
(2:27:27) topic so H now I'm all done kissing your ass Cass go ahead and rip rip me to shreds rip me to shreds Cass go aheading
(2:27:35) me completely the bastard the rhetoric is so good go
(2:27:41) ahead okay so let's uh let's talk about the prior caller uh so um do you believe
(2:27:48) that the United States was more libertarian prior to 1913
(2:27:54) Andrew uh yes um do you believe that Rockefeller was more Christian than Jeff
(2:28:02) Bezos no no no do you know that he was a Christian right well I know that he self
(2:28:08) ided as one but based on what rockefeller's funding was for feminism
(2:28:13) he was moving towards some kind of bizarre uh Protestant as you may know H
(2:28:19) well I know that you know this uh early protestantism gave us all kinds of bizarre Cults many of them did become
(2:28:26) very rich Cults often do become rich Rockefeller was one who followed such an
(2:28:32) ideology uh he was a Protestant who followed one of you know one of these
(2:28:38) bizarre um you know Protestant Cults essentially that was his
(2:28:43) ideology right but he was still more Christian than Bezos in his ideology you
(2:28:49) I'm not sure whether you're talking about uh like the well can you can you and I agree that you can have a a form
(2:28:56) of Christianity which is so perverse that atheism is likely Superior there's
(2:29:02) no there's no distinction between the two at some point well okay I I'll grant
(2:29:07) you that uh how about Vanderbilt do you do you believe that Vanderbilt was more Christian than Bezos I would give the
(2:29:15) same critique but I'm just going to Grant it for the sake of granting it yes I would say by by metric yes and my
(2:29:21) first question was uh okay let's just say differently was the United States itself not like the leaders of industry
(2:29:29) was the United States itself more Christian prior to 19133 yes could could the all the arms
(2:29:37) of the state that are acting towards de christening the United States are acting
(2:29:43) to support the public schools the public health care uh the dissolution of the
(2:29:51) lodge system uh the dissolution of private insurances by Christian organizations could all of that have
(2:29:57) been funded without the shift in 1913 no no no so uh all of the people
(2:30:07) you mean with the central bank right of course with the Central Bank uh with
(2:30:12) with the basically the shift of the the counter revolution in the United States that started in with Hamilton but
(2:30:19) culminated uh in 1913 with the absolute victory of the Socialist yeah I agree with this so
(2:30:25) so now you see that there is a there's a clear Trend where we see the cause and the effect the the cause was
(2:30:33) centralization and the effect Was the removal of the competing power which was
(2:30:39) um well power of Christianity let me Ste let me make sure I Steelman this so I
(2:30:44) get it correct guys you're saying the centralization especially of money in this case is bank which is able to fund
(2:30:52) these social revolutions which they have done successfully over and over and over gives evidence to the idea that the
(2:30:59) monopolization of centralized power is bad is that is that correct uh I I I
(2:31:05) don't think it's the um so yes but uh it depends on uh where does the power come
(2:31:12) from so where does the Monopoly come from if the Monopoly comes from expanding some Market tenfold for
(2:31:19) example a bunch of Christians are uh living under candle light and you
(2:31:24) suddenly expand the market of oil tfold so so all of them can have kerosene lamps suddenly millions of people have
(2:31:31) enough light to actually read the Bible at home uh then that is a monopoly that's worthy of all of your moral
(2:31:39) values you don't have anything against it whereas if the Monopoly is on the ability of the government to say hey
(2:31:45) Christians all of your gold now belongs to us all of your life savings now can't reinvest B into your community it just
(2:31:52) belongs to the government that's a different type of centralization I agree but my argument here would be that you
(2:31:58) cannot oppose this without good strong Christian centralization yourself I would argue that because Christians were
(2:32:05) not entrenched rather there was atheists like the people who pushed the bill in
(2:32:11) 1913 which was specifically a single Congressman uh who pushed that that bill
(2:32:17) inside of um of Congress that absent a
(2:32:22) strong Christian centralization you have no way to combat these things there's no way for you to fight
(2:32:30) back I I would agree but there's a different there are different types of centralization so one centralization is
(2:32:38) uh you're gaining Power by trading with other people and by becoming a pillar of the community and you're building The
(2:32:44) Shining City on the hill and everybody comes in and they start working for you working with you like you do here on The
(2:32:50) Crucible for example sure that's a centralization that's perfectly Justified because none of us are um like
(2:32:56) we're all here voluntarily none of us have to show up like I didn't have to be here I'm here because I find Value in it
(2:33:03) and we find Mutual value in this exchange uh but if decentralization was forced you would quickly um go corrupt
(2:33:11) and basically you wouldn't be interested in the actual value that's generated here uh because you would you would not
(2:33:17) need it you would not let us agree a second that this is true even if I do
(2:33:23) grant that this is true there's still going to have to be some form of
(2:33:28) centralization which exists that must be ethical I don't see a way around that so
(2:33:34) for instance while it is true that you and I participate here on The Crucible and you could say it's some sort of like
(2:33:40) Central Power node it's actually owned and operated by people who [ __ ] loathe me right owned and operated by
(2:33:46) people who hate my guts um yeah it is it is too they [ __ ] hate my guts they
(2:33:53) hate my gut so that the question is can we utilize yeah go Ahad we all know true
(2:33:59) power uh we know that um just like uh project Veritas has disappeared after
(2:34:06) the outing forceful outing of its founder uh if the people who are supporting you suddenly OU you uh then
(2:34:13) you will just open a new platform and yes it will be a blow but within a year or less you'll be back in full fine yeah
(2:34:20) that's true you're the value but the point but the point being is is that ultimately that is still saying you need
(2:34:27) to have Central some type of central authority to combat this that's what you're saying Cass no I am saying that
(2:34:34) but I'm saying that it's a different type this is why I think Jacob is right you need to have descriptive objective
(2:34:42) law which tells you when the authority goes corrupt it's like um a limos test
(2:34:47) like a metric like a compass it tells you that uh for example um if a Christian leader
(2:34:53) suddenly says listen because we have a slight difference in gesture between two
(2:34:59) uh subgroups of Orthodoxy I should be able to um you know uh molest all the
(2:35:04) women and uh destroy all the men instead of resolving the issue more peacefully
(2:35:11) yeah then you have a test because you're saying oh that's actually uh not balanced from the perspective of
(2:35:18) objective law now in Prior centuries people had an instinct for this that's
(2:35:24) why they said listen the heresy is not strong enough that's why we're going to join the Heretics and fight against that
(2:35:29) regime they did it on Instinct because they felt like something was unfair uh but with modern uh with contemporary
(2:35:36) libertarianism you get for the first time ever you get a more objective approach towards that uh that uh that
(2:35:45) test and so wouldn't you want to have that test around to be able but we have a problem calization turns into a
(2:35:52) problem yeah we have a gap here though the problem is this inside of this
(2:35:57) particular litmus test that you're talking about it still banks on the non-aggression principle and the
(2:36:03) defining of this nap has to be by your metric in this
(2:36:08) case Christian ethics so when I pose the question of abortion if all of these other people do not believe that this is
(2:36:15) an aggression but you do we're still going to monopolize forces in your favor
(2:36:21) you still believe your worldview is superior and that they're doing X thing wrong and so therefore forced is okay to
(2:36:28) use in order to get them to stop doing that thing so uh in Christian communities
(2:36:35) that um are tackling this particular issue uh they're doing it quite successfully and they have very low
(2:36:42) levels of abortion uh even though their only means of tackling it is shunning and moving away now in libertarian law
(2:36:49) there are much stronger which communities um I'll go into specifics in
(2:36:55) a moment I'm talking about the Amish and the menit specifically yeah you mean you mean this highly centralized Authority
(2:37:01) that if you're shunned from you uh you have no operating 21st century skills are the way to yeah so that you have no
(2:37:09) no way whatsoever uh to make in Meet absent that Community correct yeah yeah
(2:37:16) I get is fine all of I love that I love that all of this is fine because to CHR
(2:37:22) libertarianism yes listen how it's that's not Christian libertarianism yes it is no it's not what it is is a force
(2:37:30) a centralized force that has
(2:37:49) and and then and then but then same word to describe Washington DC or the United
(2:37:55) Nations you are using that word to cover a wide swaft of very different
(2:38:01) things it's just it's just micro it's just micro versus macro it is they're
(2:38:06) both just centralized power yes they are but there's a huge difference between the micro local example of of of locally
(2:38:14) except the Amish are expanding and they will expand until they take over everything if they the Amish Mafia are
(2:38:21) they are they are they flooding cities and and forcing become Amish you think that Cass doesn't know this yes of
(2:38:27) course they are they are but the Amish are doing a so not there there's Justified I don't care about Force I'm
(2:38:34) perfectly fine with throwing certain people off of certain uh Vehicles right
(2:38:40) but as a proper libertarian but I will point this out Rachel Rachel points out
(2:38:45) that this is a Continuum fallacy this is actually a continuum fallacy saying that
(2:38:50) we cannot make the determination of when something goes from the micro to the macro right you're don't use that I I
(2:38:57) don't claim that I claim that the difference is uh is specifically uh your
(2:39:03) here's the equivocation what the aner saying you may not use our our body as a
(2:39:09) heretic if you commit heresy within our society then we don't have to sell you we don't have to trade with you and you
(2:39:16) lose the means of survival because we deny our elves to you it's completely different system where you enslave
(2:39:23) yourself to to a people and they say no no no um we uh create a system where our
(2:39:29) heretic can take charge of it and deny others of their bodies and they believe
(2:39:34) that that is Justified because of security or some other uh status cope that they have that is the test you're
(2:39:41) seeking who is denying who it's perfectly fine hang it's perfectly fine for people
(2:39:48) to say I LED my territory I I I give up my territory I give up a contract where
(2:39:55) Andrew will be the king in our Covenant Community that's perfectly fine here's your flaw here's your flaw with your argumentation that the Amish Bank on the
(2:40:03) English uh enforcing their law on their behalf that's the whole problem with
(2:40:09) your argument they do not actually have the force themselves to stop people from coming in and oh I don't know unliving a
(2:40:15) bunch of people like they recently did in a Schoolhouse they don't have the authority to stop people from doing all
(2:40:21) sorts of immoral things they can excommunicate from the property but then they have to appeal to the English for
(2:40:26) the utilization of force and the centralized government and the laws thereof massive hole in your argument
(2:40:34) Cass Monopoly it one moment it is a whole only as long as you don't
(2:40:41) understand that uh the reason why they're pacifist the reason why they're doing so is because of their particular
(2:40:48) religion and they don't have access to Concepts like objective law so they don't know how to wield power correctly
(2:40:55) meaning they're too afraid they don't have the litmus test so they decide to not use any power but we have that test
(2:41:02) therefore we can use power we know who the aggressor is we can deduce that and therefore we know how to for example uh
(2:41:10) place the power into a single individual no when crosses the line as if that's true and we know who the aggressors are
(2:41:16) and we know that they're accumulating power we know that they're IST we know for sure that they're [ __ ] Communists
(2:41:22) we know for sure that they are socialists and we know for sure that their ideology is to seize power by any
(2:41:27) means while we and Libertarians are quibbling about whether or not we're allowed to exercise any ourselves no we
(2:41:33) we are allowed to exercise power and this is the main mistake of all the Collins they they Mis their their
(2:41:39) conception is that they have to justify self- inss slav to this Boomer truth
(2:41:45) regime that they have in their mind to the American flag and all the other tropes uh because they don't understand
(2:41:51) that there's an alternative that there could be a society where they could be competing power groups where Andrew is
(2:41:58) not the only Orthodox leader where you have you uh you have a little bit of a hedge where if Andrew goes corrupt
(2:42:06) there's Jay Dyer if Jay Dyer goes corrupt there's but isn't that what we have now there's Patrick that's that's
(2:42:12) what you have now and and what I'm telling you is that um what we're trying
(2:42:18) to convey is that people need to understand the test when to know that you've crossed the line I know that you
(2:42:24) don't cross the line but but the people in your chat I don't believe that they're educated enough to know when you
(2:42:31) might be tempted to cross the line you're not tempted yet which is great but when you gain real power you will be
(2:42:37) so what will hold you back what will hold you back is enough of not just religion but if enough no sorry but
(2:42:45) historically religion has been very good at uh slowing things down at moderating
(2:42:50) things so is atheism but it w but it wasn't perfect and in order to improve on it you need
(2:42:58) to have some kind of a standard that's the only thing we're bringing in yeah but the standard the standard which
(2:43:03) people will apply to hold me accountable will be the lack of the religious values which I espouse that will be their
(2:43:10) standard otherwise what would they be appealing to to hold me to account to begin with cash well well two things on
(2:43:18) the relig religious matters on matters of Faith they will apply the Christian
(2:43:23) standard right on matters of whether your power has become corrupt meaning
(2:43:29) youve cross the same standard they will apply the libertarian standard no they won't they'll apply the same Christian
(2:43:36) standard for corruption of whether or not I concede to what is considered
(2:43:41) satanic whether or not I bow my head to the lgbtq mafia whether or not I bow my
(2:43:47) head to the things which value Christendom itself that is the standard
(2:43:52) they'll hold me to not some obscure libertarian argumentation ethics they're
(2:43:57) not going to hold me to that standard they don't even believe it themselves yes and that's a problem with them
(2:44:03) that's why they call in and they sound like grateful little slaves that's why they say yes police officer as their
(2:44:10) neighbor gets beat down they don't understand where the line gets crossed well I think that example is bad because
(2:44:15) I think half the chat hates cops honestly but but but okay I understand what you're I understand what you're
(2:44:21) saying here and I get that you're saying that you're the architect of your own enslavement however as a Greeks pointed
(2:44:27) out without law there can be no Freedom when you're talking about law and we get
(2:44:34) into this gray area of who whose perspective of law do we follow for this
(2:44:40) principle of non-aggression he says Christian ethics but yet at the same time will allow people to do things
(2:44:47) which violate that ethical standard which he will impose on others uh allow
(2:44:52) is a very strong word here Jacob how do you allow it do you allow people to trade with you who are
(2:45:01) sodomites yes well stop doing that stop doing that stop it I mean not well hold on I
(2:45:10) don't I don't ask every person who I transact with if they're a sodomite before I know but that would be but that
(2:45:15) would be irrational to do that would not be rational um but if you had for knowledge of the
(2:45:22) thing that's the question yeah you have the tool within libertarianism you can
(2:45:27) exclude from your own property and as a Christian you ought exclude that's the where the ought comes in right I'm only
(2:45:34) here to talk about the option like I might choose not to exclude I might choose to
(2:45:40) exclude communities and private law to exclude a whole whole flu of things and
(2:45:45) I have I have no problem with that just last question Jacob quickly very quickly Cass is libertarian law
(2:45:52) objective I would say it is good at least we're there what we should talk
(2:45:58) about that sometime what okay yeah you guys should get together uh Casmir thank you for the calling I gave you more
(2:46:04) speaking time than anybody else can't ever say that I don't favor my buddy
(2:46:09) Cass I do I always have Cass you have a great night brother great show all right
(2:46:14) thank you have a great one uh guys we're going to get over to the super chats we're at two hours 45 minutes I'm really
(2:46:20) trying to get this guy out of here at the three-hour Mark I did warn you I did warn you right Jacob I I've I've watched
(2:46:26) the show for a while I know the drill yeah it's so bad although I I still underestimated how hard it is to answer
(2:46:32) questions in like 20 seconds you know why it's called The Crucible yeah can we
(2:46:38) get some W's in chat for Jacob as he just went through The Crucible now
(2:46:44) imagine doing this night after night right but anyway uh need so many old man
(2:46:49) naps that's right need old man naps that's correct d Derek Laro sends in 10 bucks just want to show support for the
(2:46:55) stream appreciate that legendary CP CEO sends in $50 glad that he's a legendary
(2:47:01) CEO and can afford to do that um just showing support for the stream danne
(2:47:06) Snider Jacob cannot speak to what Libertarians believe because non-conformity and high fences are
(2:47:12) inherent to libertarianism no two Libertarians agree on enough to say Libertarians agree
(2:47:19) very quickly uh yeah I mean that's that that is a problem libertarianism is is very
(2:47:26) uh I don't know fractured and that's why I think libertarianism needs to learn a Christian conservative lesson like I
(2:47:33) said Andrew you're the man do you like Skyrim or Mass Effect what the [ __ ] is this or that's a bifurcation it's a
(2:47:38) logical fallacy I like them both I like them both it's not an either or
(2:47:44) proposition danne Snider five bucks libertarianism is a doctrine of I don't rather than than I do they're Eternal
(2:47:51) critics who have all the answers but have done [Music] nothing uh yeah libertarianism is filled
(2:47:59) with largely unimpressive people their Advocates the most impressive ones are from my tradition so check out guys like
(2:48:04) Dave Smith check out uh Tom Woods The mises Institute those are where the the the good Libertarians who understand
(2:48:11) culture and and things like that are uh T haa for five bucks says I'm Orthodox but agree that calling all
(2:48:17) non-orthodox marriages degenerate isn't supported by either scripture or tradition actually is supported by
(2:48:22) tradition um and it's supported by scripture but the thing is is we weren't able to get into it however at some
(2:48:29) point yeah we do but specifically this criticism is about State marriage in the
(2:48:34) United States that was the context myself and Chen were speaking about not
(2:48:39) could be not that there could be a reflection of um you know some type of
(2:48:45) mirroring of Christianity which would be better than some alternative from a consequentialist point of view but
(2:48:50) you're still creating another category and this has actually been a debate
(2:48:56) within the Orthodox fear for a long time most Christians fears in fact is what we
(2:49:01) want to prescribe do we want to prescribe to the other category sarcastic warlock for five bucks says I
(2:49:07) run my house as a fascist dictator and thinking of a family governed through principles or lack thereof of
(2:49:14) libertarianism gives me the chills did you want to respond to that you you I
(2:49:19) mean in my decentralized Approach yeah that the more local you are the more fascistic you should
(2:49:25) be yeah well by the way sarcastic warlock longtime Crucible contributor uh
(2:49:30) good friend of the show appreciate the Super Chat very much tag haa for five bucks says uh you will hear a single
(2:49:38) quote from the Lord action and build your entire political ideology on it uh no there's plenty of things I I I
(2:49:46) again there actually I have libertarian friends who texted me who were like I can't believe you cucked on this point
(2:49:52) but like again I I predicted that because I I I don't make the I don't make the Christian nationalist happy or the Christian libertarian
(2:49:59) happy Ben George for $100 huge $100 Dono get the W's in chat for that you can
(2:50:05) argue which systems of centralized power are better or worse but in the end you're only arguing the morality of the
(2:50:11) people in power over other people are there many bad systems or many bad people this is to the heart of this
(2:50:17) question Jacob um yeah I don't know if I quite there
(2:50:23) many bad yeah I mean there's no I mean I think sometimes the issue I have is that
(2:50:28) people will engage in like a Nirvana fallacy where they're just like you know why doesn't your system solve every possible conceivable problem it's like
(2:50:35) well no system solves every Pro possible conceivable problem I think they can solve the problem [ __ ] goats Jacob I
(2:50:41) think some systems can at least solve that problem is that Nirvana fallacy that I say that uh people shouldn't [ __ ]
(2:50:47) goats and I'll stop them with force is that am I really engaging in a Nirvana fallacy Jacob like do you honestly
(2:50:54) believe that I know again I think I told you I wasn't dying on that hill but like if listen if all you were saying is
(2:50:59) let's enforce property rights and not let people [ __ ] goats then we wouldn't have much to disagree with it's it's
(2:51:05) some of the other stuff that that uh that becomes problematic Nirvana to stop my brother from terminating himself uh
(2:51:13) because he does not own himself I again it just to me it just seems like endless
(2:51:19) kind of uh the internal critique is just endless uh contradictions from my perspective but then I guess I I need to
(2:51:25) know like I need to know the consistent standard from your perspective in terms of like where do you draw the line and
(2:51:30) like what like is all nonviolent sin is all sin open for the government to to to legislate and to try to use Force to
(2:51:37) stop and if not where is the line on your worldview to say oh we can use Force have to comp with rality it would
(2:51:43) have to comport with rationality and we can have a complete and total debate on what is r versus irrational within
(2:51:50) Christian ethics very simple to do and it's a rejection of the natural law and
(2:51:55) I can demonstrate that for you just like I demonstrated how you have a lot of inconsistent points tonight at least I
(2:52:01) thought I was able to demonstrate that well let us keep moving on with the super chats by the way I understand that
(2:52:07) you are at a disadvantage on an adversarial platform but Jacob you ran The Crucible thousands of people
(2:52:14) watching you live can you give yourself a pat on the back can we record you patting yourself on the back give
(2:52:19) yourself a pat on the back you ran The Crucible sir um by the way Mitch Murphy
(2:52:26) says his whole debate is Jacob trying to convince Andrew he's not a
(2:52:34) Libertarian FB for 10 bucks says Andrew If You Dance with the Devil you don't change devil changes you SEC or humanist
(2:52:40) or not your friends they will not work with you um actually I tend to agree
(2:52:46) with this ultimately um so this guy is what a big government
(2:52:51) sucks free trade GOP Boomer uh GOP has been some of the
(2:52:58) biggest sellouts to progressivism over the last century so uh I mean screw the GOP
(2:53:03) um uh yeah I mean I'm I'm in favor of free trade so uh Andrew we are all God's creations
(2:53:11) nothing wrong with all to be Christians everyone belongs to God I don't think there's anything wrong with it some
(2:53:18) people get weird like it's like oh you want everyone to be Christian that makes you I'm like sorry yeah duh it's that
(2:53:26) [ __ ] evil authoritarianism and baked inside that libertarianism that you present the authoritarianism as but iron
(2:53:33) Panther says bring back thy Christian thy Christian let me see if I
(2:53:38) can do this Christian monarchy I I [ __ ] it up like four times okay go ahead go ahead mod
(2:53:45) you say it right moreal is in the chat for the host uh CH christianian
(2:53:55) christianian listen I mean it's always compared to what and in some ways Christian monarchy is preferable to the
(2:54:02) neoliberal uh democracy live today in basically every way conceivable that you can think
(2:54:09) of right in a lot of ways yeah I mean I think there there were
(2:54:15) some okay Ben George says instead we have California passing laws and regulations that most States eventually
(2:54:21) adopt right they Outsource the ideology right uh yeah I mean and then you also
(2:54:28) see stuff that happened in Europe that that comes here as well so I mean a lot of like I was listening to my pastor
(2:54:33) gave a seron other day I had to correct him because he was like oh all the sexual stuff came from uh the sexual revolution in in the 60s and 70s yeah
(2:54:41) that was happening in Europe like 30 40 years before that so I well actually was happening by Protestants long before
(2:54:46) that and their Cults in the 1800 but yeah and you know this you know it's
(2:54:52) true by the way grab a copy of of ult feminism it goes through the history of
(2:54:57) that to wo for 10 bucks says does Christian libertarianism allow women voting birth control abortion lgbtq
(2:55:03) propaganda if not then it's not libertarian and if so then it's not
(2:55:08) Christian uh well I think uh just like Lauren Chen and others have made Arguments for how you can have I
(2:55:15) wouldn't say like only men can vote but you can if you're going to have democracy which I'm not even convinced we should have that but if you're going
(2:55:21) to have it you can have systems of voting that would lean heavily towards more uhri patriarchal system yeah uh
(2:55:28) birth control it by the way I feel like she lifted all of that from yours truly I'm not going to lie I do I feel like I
(2:55:35) changed Chin's mind hopefully I have changed yours this evening as well at least a little bit Jeremiah says
(2:55:41) translation of Jacob it would be great if God got what he explicitly prescribed
(2:55:47) but that's unreal istic I can see the cognitive dissonance inside say God God
(2:55:53) will get what he prescribed but but what is normative for how we are to act in pursuit of that uh this one comes in
(2:56:00) from Electronics onsite Jacob count me into your Christian
(2:56:05) Empire you're centralized authoritarian Christian Empire he wants he wants a
(2:56:11) seat at the table Jacob I had a friend text me and say like you're sounding such a theocrat sorry yeah yeah I bring
(2:56:18) out the best in people tag W for five bucks says Christian libertarianism is
(2:56:24) as coherent as Christian Satanism actually that was one of the arguments I was going to present to you for marriage
(2:56:30) uh and I think we'll be able to get into that in a future debate again we'll have to schedule it out but I'd love to have
(2:56:36) you back for a followup so we can actually get to the Christian marriage portion of this we'll have to we'll have to schedule it out a little bit because
(2:56:42) in uh July my wife's giving birth to our fifth child so a bit time off for that
(2:56:48) dude congratulations man from the Wilsons to you send me your dress so we can get the gift basket out man that's I
(2:56:54) love hearing that that's awesome it's too bad you're a [ __ ] calvinist but other than that other than that we're
(2:57:02) still gonna send the wine we're still gonna send the wine and the cheese right they got to do it Dutch style the wife
(2:57:07) is half how about Ham on bun can we freeze ham on bun like the Dutch
(2:57:13) do uh thus says for five bucks I'm late to the party but please debate libertarianism with Eric juuli be a
(2:57:20) great debate um happy to do it $20 comes in from Pim ores who says great content
(2:57:27) Andrew won I'm for the tradition that protects the people against whom lust for power for power's sake power is
(2:57:33) ultimately the art of controlling other people's actions and making everyone slaves to thy will Christianity is the
(2:57:39) tradition that protects people the best but I think that that the state subverts the church and subverts Christianity so
(2:57:45) if we want to have strong churches and and strong Christian Nations we need to have small limited government Ben George
(2:57:51) says adding Christian to libertarianism doesn't make you a Christian if you don't care about goats and Men you might
(2:57:58) want to drop that whole Christian part no I I you can care get those are
(2:58:04) like borderline edge cases and what I will say that Andrew has definitely pushed me on some of those edge cases that I need to think on but I'm not an
(2:58:11) ideologically possessed libertarian uh again but you always got to consider tradeoffs and like Andrew even said we
(2:58:17) have to talk about about uh what is rational and all I was saying is like yeah if something's happening out in the
(2:58:23) open take care of it but I'm not going to you know there's reductio ad absurdum in in a lot of different directions
(2:58:29) there that's not a reductio ad absurdum to say that men practice beastiality and
(2:58:34) they do and that we ought to stop and prevent them from doing so how's that a
(2:58:40) reduct your ad absurdum well it's the prevent part it's like what are you going to do to what end we're going to
(2:58:45) throw their [ __ ] asses in prison we're going to throw him in [ __ ] prison what do you mean that's a great
(2:58:51) preventor PR is a preventor are you saying that if if we made abortion
(2:58:56) illegal tomorrow that that would not prevent abortions are you really saying that no
(2:59:03) that would so there's a there's a prevention in deterrency sure yeah that that would help prevent come on that's
(2:59:09) ridiculous Wicked Wally five bucks says it's supposed to be a mountain goat not a mount a goat I just wanted to Ram that
(2:59:17) one home quite the dad joke from Mr Wicked Wally uh $10 comes in from TAG
(2:59:24) haa who says Jacob uh do you have a relatively high percentage of askanazi
(2:59:30) DNA by any chance Russian Jew is my ancestry uh when w grad's actually I think great uh in Russian so yeah my uh
(2:59:38) great-grandfather came over here from like well it's like pole Russia but yeah like as do well unlike many um that's
(2:59:45) not a thing I give a flying [ __ ] about but um I also I I'm super critical of Zionism
(2:59:51) in the state of Israel yeah I don't want to even get into any of that we're not getting in we're not touching on any of
(2:59:57) that sir Chris Bren for $10 says tag what a Christian does not care about DNA
(3:00:03) I agree with this so I this is a critical actual point that I make all the time what did Christ say to those
(3:00:10) who were the Seed of Abraham uh I totally agree with this though I
(3:00:15) understand I understand some of the argu I'm sure you do to Jacob tag W says why
(3:00:20) is it so different to prevent suicide versus sodomy both send you to hell
(3:00:27) yeah can you use Force to prevent anything that can send somebody to hell because then at that point your standard
(3:00:33) is you can use Force to prevent every sin that would not comport with rationality and if you read the writings
(3:00:39) of Paul he was very specific that sexual sin in particular as it is a sin against
(3:00:47) yourself is a brutal sin it is something which should be deterred even within the law I
(3:00:55) mean this was very this is this has been laid out very clearly biblically uh but
(3:01:02) however I think that saying that we would give the same punishment to someone who stole a penny is absurd that's irrational right that's not
(3:01:08) that's not rational thinking well and we agree that we should take I mean honestly we should take the marriage
(3:01:14) completely out of the state and so I don't think gay marriage should even be a thing then what people do in the
(3:01:20) privacy of their own homes I mean it's like we should be disincentivizing this
(3:01:25) stuff and I also stay marriage is an inversion is it yeah yeah that's right that's my whole but that was my whole
(3:01:31) argument to Chen was that it was an inversion and you argued with me in your in your
(3:01:37) Counterpoint was an inversion we'll have to get well because I think you can have
(3:01:43) without the state people who get married who are not doing it in you're promoting inversion promoting inversion that's the
(3:01:50) pro we will get back into this because it's it's an absurd position I don't think you can defend it but well atin
(3:01:57) agrees with me so yeah not really no in fact I went back and read what they said
(3:02:03) specifically about this and they're talking about a mirror image to what Christianity is what is a mirror image
(3:02:10) to what a Christian marriage reflects that is what can be considered the good
(3:02:15) not an inversion to that that would be considered the bad across the board yeah
(3:02:20) State marriage would be an inversion but if you had people what were we talking about talking but what were we talking
(3:02:29) about we were talking about what we were talking about State
(3:02:35) marriage bro but she about secular marriage which I guess doesn't doesn't that was when we said secular marriage
(3:02:40) in the United States what are we talking about if you're talking about specifically just the the state having a
(3:02:48) uh the ability to issue marriage licenses then yeah I would agree with you it's an inversion right and she
(3:02:54) agreed she understood instantly when we were making the reference of secular marriage we were talking specifically in
(3:03:01) the term of you prescribing State marriage in the United States she knew it that's why she changed her
(3:03:07) position that's why your criticism was bad your criticism cross aboard on that was bad it was not a good criticism it
(3:03:15) might have been a misunderstanding on my part I thought you were also closing off that if there's any Union of a man and woman that's monogamous man and female
(3:03:23) if it like if the state wasn't prescribing it but they didn't do it sacramentally through the church I thought you were also calling that
(3:03:29) degeneracy I still think that that would be a promotion of degeneracy that ought not be prescribed by you or I you would
(3:03:35) never make such a prescription to your atheist friends would you or would you just because you think that it might
(3:03:41) might gain you um you know a Christian perhaps I mean homy 12 on Colossians
(3:03:49) Chris ausome basically says that yeah like marage was given even to not it's not limited to Christians and that this
(3:03:55) helps uh regulate their passions promote uh them coming towards the Christian
(3:04:01) world view yeah but no this has no reflection on modernity and what is
(3:04:07) considered a modern monogamous Rel yeah we're going to get back into this dude this [ __ ] that's that's it's a
(3:04:13) ridiculous stance I'm not going to lie uh tag who five bucks says if this is an uphill battle for Andrew I hate to see a
(3:04:19) downhill One D says Andrew Chancellor Palpatine is evil anytime you want to do
(3:04:25) that debate we can do that debate uh Ben George says so how do we pay for war taxes which are taken by force
(3:04:32) ultimately that's true um so uh Libertarians are divided into minarchist
(3:04:38) and Anarchist and true the the consistent position would be taxation is theft and shouldn't be funded at all uh
(3:04:45) there are people like haa Bob Murphy others who have written about the private production of Defense so
(3:04:50) theoretically possible to construct uh a military defense without taxation would I make the perfect the enemy of the good
(3:04:56) if there was a Qui very quick sorry um unconventional man he big fan
(3:05:02) of The Crucible and we're a big fan of his work as well though he disagrees with me on libertarian principles says
(3:05:08) Andrew I took exception with the want I want moral people in power the data is
(3:05:13) clear that power corrupts and people can't handle power yet you're saying let's give these groups of people power
(3:05:20) to deal with that LMFAO come on actually this is not a contradiction because you can look at
(3:05:27) studies in modernity and claim in modernity that you can look at Power structures which have been corrupted
(3:05:34) that does not mean that that is a historic truth there have been phenomenal Kings who have not been
(3:05:39) corrupted by their power um Ace fecto for 10 bucks says
(3:05:46) nothing just wants to support the channel don't appreciate that Jacob if by your own admission says s dude from
(3:05:51) Andrew's inquiry that ideally there shouldn't be a separation of church and state how exactly is this a libertarian
(3:05:58) view so if if people mean a separation of church and state as in is that the
(3:06:04) church uh as a as a governing body should not be the civil magistrate then
(3:06:10) I agree that there should not be the same thing that are different ecclesiastical Authority can
(3:06:15) govern law uh again I just think these are different types of authority that got what about
(3:06:21) the Amish um I mean there's things about the omish I like but I I I again I think
(3:06:27) that there is a difference between and and it gets a little blurry I guess when you get down to like a really local granular level but um and I think
(3:06:34) churches should be to macro though right well again I don't think that separation of church and state should mean that
(3:06:41) Christians should not be part of government I don't think that means that the church shouldn't have an influence
(3:06:47) on what government does it should these fears should interact with each other and actually you need a Christian
(3:06:53) Society and a church to hold governing institutions accountable so that they're actually enforcing like what is good
(3:06:59) rather than what is evil $20 comes in from Department of new Miss sadx and he
(3:07:04) says Mr Boule that is Mr Boule the one and only
(3:07:10) great debate fellas Jacob if you were locked in a 10x10 room with es without Escape who would you rather be stuck
(3:07:16) with Andrew or a stack of pineapple pizzas or a bear this is the legitimate the most
(3:07:22) legitimate question I've heard all night H
(3:07:28) um uh G well maybe I can use the pineapple pizzas if they're hot enough to defend myself from Andrew who is
(3:07:35) clearly given into degeneracy by uh coming in with a stack of pineapple pizzas this this is ridic yeah it's
(3:07:42) ridiculous the pineapple pizza thing is just it's so over the [ __ ] top say this is going to be an Australian bear
(3:07:50) like those are real I mean that's fair that's fair uh
(3:07:57) guys I'm sorry we're way over the three-hour Mark we had a few more uh chats which came in I just wanted to get
(3:08:03) to the um to the ones that uh you know obviously they send in some more cash I wish I could do better than that we're
(3:08:09) running behind on time because of callers I never get this perfect I'm blaming the moderator I'm supposed to
(3:08:15) allocate blame of effectively so welcome to the dark side Jacob it would be good
(3:08:21) to have more on the side of reason and virtue are you joining us Jacob can we Count On You Jacob uh what what I've
(3:08:28) said so I've talked to a lot of Christian nationalists type I had Stephen wolf on my show I've talked to CJ Engle uh and and what I'm promoting
(3:08:35) is essentially that you know those of us who are on the Conservative Christian dissident right um you know whether we
(3:08:42) be libertarian or nationalists that we we we have common enemies and right now we should be focusing on uh fighting the
(3:08:49) culture War pushing back onto genery creating the Christian creating the Christian majority that we need before
(3:08:55) any of our political Solutions are going to be practical that's the Muslim argument Unite with us because we have
(3:09:00) common enemies and so therefore uh let us in let us in Jacob well except hang
(3:09:06) on hang on Jacob let us in we we we we have commonality in in in
(3:09:14) Christ which I think is the uh the different I agree with that that's excellently done Ben George for 10 bucks
