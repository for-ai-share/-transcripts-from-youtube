(5:13) know what that is a cortisan a woman of the night she's a woman of the night okay at a a

(5:21) cortisan okay a cortisan yeah my name is Andrew Wilson i'm the host of The Crucible it's popular entertainment

(5:27) channel on YouTube i'm a political analyst a political satist and I engage in conversations debates all over the

(5:33) world and I'm happy to have this debate today with you too so I appreciate you guys coming all right

(5:39) brian Atlas 35 host of the whatever podcast washed up over the hill has been

(5:44) YouTuber uh that's pretty much it for me um all right so I guess we're um going

(5:49) to get into some of our first topics here uh do you guys seem to have

(5:54) specific disagreements with the podcast it seems do we Do you Is that That was my

(6:01) impression but Oh like me us with this podcast yeah like the dating talk

(6:07) podcast oh I mean I did initially but since the last time I was on I realized that you weren't that terrible so not

(6:14) that terrible slightly terrible though what are the things I'm terrible about in terms of my views or whatever i don't

() 

(6:21) think that you're that bad anymore um I think that just Okay what about this guy next speak up a little bit though yeah

(6:26) sorry um I I guess our disagreements would probably be about the whole

(6:32) women's voting and some political stuff um I think religion as well it's kind of

(6:38) hard to disagree on that but um I think we could have a conversation about the morality

(6:44) behind religion sure so Sure uh and then

(6:49) what about you i don't have an issue with either one of you we've never met or interacted um my initial impression

(6:58) of the podcast was simply through clips I've seen on like Tik Tok and Instagram but of course those can always be taken

(7:05) grandly out of context um but after watching a little bit of it it's a way different than I imagined so I'm happy

(7:12) to be here do you both describe yourselves as feminists

(7:18) uh I've never described myself as a feminist but yeah I like women

(7:25) maybe a quick definitions like feminism would be the movement towards an egalitarian society deconstructing the

(7:31) patriarchy no no so do you think women are an

(7:37) oppressed class not in America okay i'd have to agree with her yeah okay not in

() 

(7:44) America not in America so there you think men and women have perfectly equal rights or at least women have as many

(7:51) rights as men i would say so yeah same for you i don't disagree okay um and you

(7:59) don't categorize either of yourselves as feminists is that correct i would have to say no there's a lot of corners of

(8:05) modern feminism that don't like me based on what I do for work so that's kind of

(8:11) tough to navigate in itself sex work conversation um and what what do you

(8:18) guys think about do you think there is a patriarchy she she had an opening statement actually oh really you wrote I

(8:23) did I wrote Yeah we can sure we can do that all right um Okay i said uh that I

(8:31) think morality should evolve with society and I think that empathy is the foundation of a just world and I think

(8:37) that Trumpism is rooted in division cruelty and a lack of accountability and

(8:43) I think that religion is used to justify harmful and outdated beliefs especially about women in other countries and I

(8:50) don't reject the idea of high of a higher power but I don't think that a text written by bronze age no nomads

(8:57) should dictate modern morality uh and my stance on politics is about what I believe is right and wrong based on

(9:03) reason and empathy um so I just would like you to consider whether it's truly

(9:10) moral or just convenient for maintaining power when it comes to religion i see

(9:18) okay okay okay all right do you have a opening statement or um I would keep it

(9:23) very brief uh I didn't write anything out my perspective on religion religion

(9:29) is that I actually find it slightly delusional in most senses um I would

(9:35) consider myself an atheist to keep it simple um I actually grew up in the

(9:40) Catholic church i know that's a little bit different from Christianity in some aspects so that's totally fair however I

(9:47) think um whether you're questioning or unquestioning in your belief of a god in

(9:53) a traditional sense I personally um find it unrealistic um and people don't question

(9:59) it enough i think delusional is the best way that I can describe it i'm

(10:05) interested to hear your perspectives because in what I've learned about you just in my research before this I'm

(10:11) actually really interested um to talk to you and I am coming at this from a non-aggressive

(10:19) non-argumentative way i hope to portray that at least

(10:24) probably going to get pretty argumentative just not going to lie and that's okay it's probably going to be

(10:29) pretty argumentative uh you had uh views on immigration too right i had some yeah yeah let's start

(10:37) there uh one really quick thing i do uh I do want to do a quick secondary thank

(10:43) you to Ogle who popped uh a crystal ball for us in our debate uh just about an

(13:31) next next next next what the next

(13:38) there was quite a quite a few next next

(13:43) next next next

(13:50) next i apologize to the viewers i know this is Okay next there it is okay this is what

(13:57) started the conversation as it pertains to immigration elon Musk on February 18th uh posted uh haha wow uh in

(14:06) response to the White House posting ASMR illegal alien deportation flight scroll down a little bit on this

(14:12) Mick scroll down okay and to which you responded

(14:19) "You have no empathy for men." Which led off to a conversation you and I had about immigration uh so are you in favor

(14:27) of illegal immigration in Didn't you say that morality is based

(14:32) around empathy yes I did so wouldn't that be an immoral position or is it just a moral position

(14:38) because you don't have any empathy for this group of people what do you mean i said you have no empathy talking about

(14:44) Elon Musk just because I mean I'm not for illegal immigration that's not something that I'm uh advocating for but

(14:52) I think that posting in that way as if it's funny to um do that to people and

(14:59) just pick up their whole lives I I don't think that that's funny i think it's tragic um and I understand that we have

(15:05) to do it but I think that it could be done in a in a better way that's not

(15:12) uh immoral so you your problem was that he was just laughing about it yeah I do

(15:17) yeah I do have a problem with that but I mean it is kind of ironically funny right

() 

(15:22) ow well because if you break into my house right and then the cops come and

(15:30) take you out I'm probably going to laugh at you right okay would would you would

(15:35) you laugh at somebody broke in your house and then I do think that's a little bit different though but would

(15:40) you would you laugh at them sure yeah your empathy for them then well I think that's a little bit different um cuz

(15:47) those people aren't breaking into my house to live a better life they're breaking into my house probably for a

(15:53) bad reason I would assume anyway um well I mean it's a good reason for them right

(15:59) like their reasons for breaking into your house is they want your stuff for a materially better life just like the

(16:04) immigrant right right well I guess that's subjective based on scenario but

(16:10) I um I I don't think that it's right to

(16:15) laugh about that in particular when it comes to immigration h

(16:20) So you're not for illegal immigration i'm not uh no i I Well obviously not i mean I

(16:29) don't think that It is what it is though you know if if we could stop it then I

(16:34) think that would be great but that's just not I don't think that that's possible i don't think that'll ever be

(16:39) possible what about deportations is that okay i think um I think that depends really for me

(16:48) morally i think obviously criminals uh that makes sense that's been in place

(16:53) for a long time but I think when it comes to kids like in the Dhaka program that have grown up here and have never

(17:00) lived like in their home country and they don't speak that language I think that deporting them is immoral i think

(17:06) that's wrong and I understand that it's their parents fault you know when they bring them over here it's a selfish

(17:12) decision but um to put that on the kids kind of just seems unfair to me doesn't

(17:18) it seem unfair to me that it's an it's an unfair situation all around but so so

(17:23) how come this is what I don't understand about the empathy is morality crowd i

(17:29) really don't get this part you say well Andrew we really got to be empathetic

(17:35) towards these people and their plight it's like but at the expense of me and

(17:40) mine where's the empathy towards me and mine and then it just kind of becomes well their shit's worse right right it's

(17:47) like but but but isn't there supposed to be empathy on both sides i totally think

(17:53) that there should be yeah um I mean it's really hard to pick a side when it comes

(17:58) to stuff like this cuz um I agree with both of both of I agree with that but um

(18:06) I think that the implications for deporting somebody that's lived here uh for their whole life and they don't

(18:12) speak the language of their home country versus you having to deal with that person in a Walmart i feel like it's a

(18:17) little bit of a different situation when it comes to Well I understand it sucks for them like I get that they're going

(18:24) to have a lot of readjusting to do you know what I mean but for you know not every DACA recipient is under that by

(18:31) the way no not all but but the thing is is even for the ones who are right if you are to this is then this is

(18:39) one of the big kind of like primary problems maybe we can dive into with your empathy's morality thing what about

(18:47) looking forward 30 years so it's like right now we can be empathetic towards these people right that's true but what

(18:54) if you send the signal that this is now okay and so more illegals come in have

(18:59) children here understanding that well you know uh these kids in 20 years can

(19:05) make the same claim as the former DACA recipients and now we have to make all of them citizens as well bypassing all

(19:12) of the other people who are in line not much empathy for those people right right and creating now a perverse

(19:18) incentive for more people to come and do it seems like it's the least empathetic thing to do well what would your

(19:24) solution be then when it comes to deportation and legal immigration i

(19:30) would kick out every single legal immigrant who was here and everybody here who wasn't a naturalized citizen

(19:36) okay gone they have no business being in our nation uh nation is from my

(19:42) perspective it's uh culture borders language that's how uh very famous talk

(19:49) radio host Michael Savage used to frame it I largely agree with that assessment culture border language so uh in this

(19:57) case um illegal immigrants who come in they don't have the same culture they often

(20:02) like even at the hotel I'm staying at half half don't speak English right and Um

(20:09) and they've already violated the borders so like what from for me that's already

(20:15) criminal so when you say things like "Let's deport the criminals," I'm like "Well there they are." Okay they right

(20:21) they're already criminals from my perspective right they've already broken in here so

(20:27) when it comes to parents that come here uh and they have a kid here though and

(20:32) they raise that kid here obviously they made a choice to do that that's a

(20:38) selfish choice because they they know that that could be a possible implication um do you still think that

(20:44) that's fine to Well the law of the land is that um if you're born here you

(20:49) become a naturalized citizen right so So that's not So that would be I want to repeal that okay i would like for there

() 

(20:57) to be a different interpretation that says that a naturalized citizen is you have to have

(21:02) a mom and a dad and both of them are native to the nation and then they have

(21:07) a child that child becomes native to the nation that's I I would get rid of the soil policy alto together but that

(21:14) naturalb born would require your mom and your dad both be citizens of the nation

(21:19) and uh then you become a citizen that's that's like my ideal citizenship policy

(21:25) so when it comes to immigrants working here do you not think that they are good

(21:31) for the economy do you think that they are harming it sure slave labor is good for the economy

(21:36) okay it's different well not really so because because they have no

(21:42) documentation they can be paid under the table they send remittances back to their home nation which is untaxed right

(21:48) totally untacked remittances in the hundreds and hundreds of millions if not

(21:53) I think it's billions actually that they send back in remittances but don't quote me on that it's at least hundreds of millions okay they're sending back to

(21:59) their home nations that's non-t taxable the employer is able to squeeze out

(22:04) American citizens for the jobs because now they can pay under the table right uh and then they do they do do work visa

(22:10) programs but they're totally rigged right so the work visa programs are totally rigged for um for various uh

(22:17) companies um the the whole thing is a massive cluster when it comes to that so

(22:22) yeah I don't think that that's good policy i think that you're just kind of promoting slave labor essentially by

(22:30) giving people perverse incentives to have people come across the border and then they have children here and now we

(22:36) have a conundrum right right like oh what do we do now well I definitely am

(22:41) not advocating for slave labor i or people getting paid under under wage i

(22:48) don't advocate for that but just for an example like let's just say that you

(22:53) have a construction company and you have a hundred illegal immigrants working for you you're paying them under minimum

(23:00) wage and then we deport all of them so in what I think logically is I don't

(23:06) think that these businesses would be hiring a hundred American citizens and then paying them a just wage i think

(23:14) that they would be spending the same amount of money but hiring less people which would just make everything less

(23:19) efficient then why don't we just bring everybody into the United States well I

(23:25) don't think that's really an argument it's not an argument it's a question well I am not advocating for that that's

(23:31) not Yeah but why not if it just is going to perpetually increase the GDP and it's going to perpetually increase the amount

(23:37) of cheap labor that businesses can get why not just bring everybody here or bring hundreds of millions a year here

(23:43) but do you understand my point though like do you No not Well not really you're just saying if you have a

(23:49) business and the business has 100 employees right and suddenly the business owner had to pay a fair market

(23:56) competitive wage he would have less employees that seems like it's the advocation again of slave labor no I'm

(24:01) not i'm just I'm just saying that this is how I think it would go i don't think that these businesses would hire

(24:08) American citizens at the same rate and pay them a higher wage i think that it

(24:13) would be But isn't that isn't that why we want to get rid of illegals so that businesses have to hire our citizens at

(24:19) a competitive wage but do you see how it would make things less efficient and again I'm not advocating for paying

(24:26) people below minimum wage but unfortunately that is it is what it is

(24:31) so just thinking about it in terms of that would that not make it less efficient yeah so I just if you want to

(24:38) understand the implication of your argument here what you're doing is you're advocating on the on behalf of

(24:44) rich industrialists so if rich industrialists can pay people who are

(24:49) not American citizens less money to do jobs that then they make more money off their back and they don't have to

(24:56) actually employ the American public they gravitate towards that you actually have

(25:01) created a perverse incentives a perverse incentive for illegals to come here be secondass citizens and get paid less

(25:08) than the normal American right like that seems totally like contrary to what you

(25:14) actually want well I'm not advocating for that i think that just thinking about it logically like that's how these

(25:20) people run their businesses that's why they hire illegal immigrants so that they can pay them less sure people

(25:26) violate the law all the time in order to make more money which I don't agree with but I'm saying like would that not make

(25:33) things less efficient if you had less workers yes it would make things less

(25:39) efficient if you had uh less workers but however this would could easily be

(25:44) applied to slavery ending slavery is bad because it would be less efficient because we would have less workers right

(25:51) right i I do find a big distinction between slavery and illegal immigration

(25:56) though because those people are are here by choice sure but the consistency of the argument is the same so that that

(26:03) your value that you're arguing is about efficiency right so it's like okay great

(26:08) yes it is more efficient but also here's another scenario which would also be more efficient well sure but that's a

(26:14) comparison that just So it seems like efficiency is not really what you're trying to argue then you must be trying

(26:19) to argue something else because if you take efficiency and you say well I think this will hurt the efficiency of the

(26:25) business it's like so is taking black people out of cotton fields that hurts the efficiency of the cotton field right

(26:31) well in in that scenario in a in a slavery scenario uh obviously I'm not

(26:37) advocating for that but I think illegal immigrants they they want to be here they came here they want to work they

(26:43) want to make money they're contributing to our system so did slaves but not by

(26:48) choice and they're not getting paid so that's true but very big difference then the value here must be something not

(26:54) that's not efficiency you must be arguing something that's not efficiency then because you keep on saying well

(27:01) it's less efficient it's like I can grant that but then that's just an example of uh how I think that illegal

(27:08) immigration has done something good for our economy whether I think it's morally just or not I think uh that you you can

(27:16) say that it's illegal immigration can be super helpful to the economy in some aspects but it can also be very draining

(27:23) in other aspects for the instance um the these people are not paying into tax the

(27:28) the um tax system for uh basic things like government subsidies for emergency

(27:34) care right it happens in emergency rooms california had some of the finest hospitals in the world which were

(27:39) bankrupted by illegal immigrants using them basically as the emergency room as a health facility right um there's all

(27:47) sorts of net drains also that they get including fraud for social security fraud for stealing people's identities

(27:54) all sorts of fraud that drains the system not to mention remittances which aren't taxed so the thing is is like if

(28:00) you're making the moral argument based on efficiency i think that's not what you mean you don't mean efficiency

(28:07) you're just pointing out an example of how they can be a boon yeah that was just But I would just agree i would just agree there can be cases where they

(28:13) definitely help the economy okay just they're just just in net even if you

(28:18) made the the case and I agreed with it that they mostly assist the economy that's not the only dynamic of the

(28:25) problem we're looking at right yeah definitely not that's just like just an example of um why I think illegal

(28:32) immigration has been good in some ways um

(28:39) sorry no it's fine uh go ahead like specifically where I live as Well uh

(28:45) where do you live i live in Tucson oh in Arizona yeah so it's right on the border um and obviously we have a lot of

(28:53) illegal immigrants um and the people who live in the border towns hate them they sure do yeah they sure do why do you

(28:59) think that is uh because they got there illegally well because they destroy their property they um they butcher

(29:06) their cattle they um they do all sorts of horrible things to their private property they do a lot of thefts on the

(29:14) way over it it they just loathe them people in border towns are always always

(29:19) demanding more and more security inside their towns they can never get enough because I mean you can imagine how

(29:25) unsettling would it be if you go out for your nice uh you know Starbucks frat or whatever it is in the morning right and

(29:32) it has the double shot of espresso or whatever the it is that that you know pe girls get now uhhuh and you sit

(29:39) out and you're in your like little stocking whatever your your blanket and  and you're on your deck and you

(29:45) look out and there's families of illegal immigrants crossing your backyard destroying okay i I'm sure that

(29:51) that has happened to someone i've lived there for a very long time i've never seen that happen i've never heard of

(29:57) that happening um I live on the northern side so Ngalas I think is it So not the

(30:05) border side yeah not the border side but Ngalas the crime rate over there is a lot higher but I think that it's very um

(30:13) it's very community based they don't really leave that the crime stays in that area i think it's a lot of uh which

(30:20) is also bad crime it's also bad so it's like all the arguments that you can make

(30:26) as a pro for illegal immigration you just have to kind of bite the bullet that you want to concede our sovereignty

(30:32) because that's what it does it conceds our sovereignty i cannot go to Mexico tomorrow absent paperwork to and work

(30:40) there illegally right and uh do whatever I want i mean you wouldn't want to though but even if I There are tons of

(30:47) Americans who want to especially rich ones because the the power of the dollar versus the peso is so high if you're a

(30:53) multi-millionaire you go down to Mexico you can live the high life right mexican government though they want

(30:59) their money they don't want you to come into their country without sufficiently greasing the palms of the Mexican

(31:04) government which then is supposed to trickle down to its citizens whether it does or it doesn't you can't do that

(31:09) with them why is it that we should have the expression they they can do it to us yeah I mean I agree i'm I don't think

(31:16) that um I'm not I don't think that we should just open the borders and let everyone

(31:21) in but I think that there are you have to recognize the pros and the cons there

(31:27) are both we can't just say that illegal immigration is bad period because they have Would you say helped the economy

(31:33) let me ask you a question would you say that slavery is bad period

(31:38) yes i What about the pros well the pros are very one-sided when it comes to

(31:44) slavery i think illegal immigration there can Nope they're not let me give you an example okay so you have a two

(31:50) nations at war one's an aggressor nation much larger than the smaller one right

(31:56) and they attack like let's say Russia attacked a smaller nation like I don't know Ukraine let's say okay right they

(32:02) attack and the Ukrainians and during a counterattack they're able to take over a large swath of Russia with tons of

(32:11) civilians who are all loyal to Russia okay they have three options option A

(32:18) imprison them right okay option B kill them or option C let them go so that

(32:25) they and continue to assist their enemy in making weapons to kill your side okay those are your three options would it be

(32:32) more morally just to go ahead and imprison those people rather than kill them or have them run back to make

(32:39) weapons that were going to kill you

(32:44) it's a tough question i think

(32:50) um not really sure what I would do in that situation honestly now let's say you did imprison them okay but you only

(32:58) got so much food and so much resources you're fighting a war right is it just then to have them assist against their

(33:04) will i think I would let them go you would let them go to assist the enemy in killing you i I'm not Here's the thing i

(33:12) I am not a war leader i don't belong in war i'd make bad choices because I don't want anybody because empathy because

(33:19) empathy okay that's the thing right he's like I'm what I'm giving you is an example of if you were to have two

(33:25) nations they're at war one's an aggressor nation attacks a smaller one okay it seems to me like they would be

(33:31) totally justified if they counterattack this other nation rather than letting their men go and continue to come back

(33:38) and fight another day to imprison them and then force them to work against their will okay so in that scenario you

(33:45) would say that slavery is just sure okay wouldn't you well I wouldn't go that far

(33:52) i would say that maybe in that maybe it h it would have to be done but I

(33:58) wouldn't be happy about it well I mean maybe but you're not happy to be in a war well no so what I'm saying is that

(34:06) there are just times to enslave people okay and there's no if ends or buts about it i don't see and so when people

(34:13) say like you got to take the pros and the cons of something but then they make an unequivocal moral statement like there's no pros to slavery it's like yes

(34:20) there is i mean but in in but there's way more cons why we shouldn't do it i get that cuz it wouldn't that just be

(34:26) cherry-picking in a way which one i mean trying to find a good outcome of slavery

(34:32) when there are so many bad ones trying to find one good one just seems it's well it's just it's just showing that

(34:38) the principle is not consistent okay so like we're just checking the consistency of the principle so I I bore slavery

(34:45) hate it i think it's god awful okay but I still need to be consistent enough to think is it always under all

(34:52) circumstances right that are realistic like you can come up with bizarre hypotheticals where it's like would you

(34:58) enslave two people to save the world i Okay fine but that's unrealistic right what about realistic things that happen

(35:04) with slavery where you're like actually like if I was in that I'd probably do

(35:11) that right and so I'm just checking for the the principle the consistency of the principles i mean that's it's tough uh

(35:18) cuz I I mean my moral is just I don't want that to happen in general so that

(35:24) would be a hard situation for me to deal with i wouldn't be happy about it but I guess that would be uh the only solution

(35:30) so yeah yeah empathy does not always provide the answers no it doesn't but it

(35:37) can lead you down a good path I think yeah okay okay well I think one of the

(35:42) other disagreements that we had when we were discussing immigration was the question of feasibility is it feasible

(35:49) to deport the millions of illegal immigrants that are here you had objections from a economic perspective

(35:57) it's going to cost a lot to do that and you also didn't believe it was feasible

(36:02) uh I don't know if you have more to add to that or Andrew I mean do you think that there's Yeah totally feasible

(36:07) absolutely we can deploy the United States military right to the border or shoot to kill i would do it right away

() 

(36:13) tomorrow wait shoot to kill oh yeah the illegal immigrants

(36:18) it's our It's our No if on the border if they're trying to cross I thought the ones who are currently here no no no no

(36:24) is it Isn't it wrong to kill though based in religion it's wrong to murder

(36:29) is that not murder no killing someone is not murder no murder definitionally is the unjustified killing of someone okay

(36:36) so if you can justify it it's fine if you have good justification for it is that subjective can any can I kill

(36:43) anyone and justify it to myself well I would consider justification Well I would start with the idea of what

(36:49) justification is okay and then with the idea of is it an objective or subjective

(36:55) justification but either way I would be justified so if you say well there is no

(37:00) objective morality it's only subjective right and it's relative between people

(37:07) then you really can't give me any reason why I shouldn't do that so just example

(37:12) somebody breaks into your house you shoot them am I allowed to say that yeah that's fine okay um that's justified but

(37:18) you're walking down the street you see a family of illegal immigrants you don't like it you shoot them all that's not

(37:24) what he was saying no he was saying that would be unjustified yeah if they're trying to cross illegally okay so that

(37:31) they're trying to break in just like they're trying to break into your house that I would view it the same way breaking into the country mhm

(37:37) okay well I don't have an argument against that i wouldn't do that

(37:43) so I understand you're in favor of it am I no I'm not in favor of it i I just

(37:48) personally wouldn't well do you think that illegal crossings would significantly go down if the United States military was on the border and

(37:54) said if you try to cross the border illegally we open fire don't you think that yeah yes well then it sounds like I

(38:00) solved the problem okay by not using empathy all right well then let's put that into play i agree totally i don't

(38:07) know i don't know if I That's I haven't even thought of that as an a solution i

(38:12) don't know if that's my position but I would agree with you in so far as Andrew it would be a massive deterrence yes it

(38:19) would be massive deterrence okay just like nuclear bombs right why do you have nukes it's not to use them right

(38:26) deterrence it's to stop people from using them so the idea isn't actually to send them down there with orders to shoot to kill the idea is that because

(38:32) they have orders to shoot to kill they'll never have to okay that's the idea i mean if nobody has to die well we

(38:40) hope probably some will okay yeah probably some well I don't think that

(38:45) there is a like a flat simple way to fix

(38:51) the immigration problem i pretty sure that would fix it that's a way sure i just um I think that would be really

(38:58) hard to pass yeah that's true i think you're correct that it would be difficult to pass through Congress an

(39:06) act of Congress which mobilized but well you know the president's the commander-in-chief though he doesn't I'm

(39:12) not sure that that would be war authorization so I think he could actually unilaterally just order the

(39:19) military and order the border states to mobilize their national guard with orders to shoot i think he actually could do that

(39:26) didn't he try to get the military over there though the military is there now they just don't have orders to shoot to kill right unfortunately okay

(39:34) well he says unfortunately what do you think is that unfortunate do you think

(39:39) it's unfortunate that they can't kill them i don't think that that's unfortunate i I don't I'm not advocating

(39:45) for the killing of anybody well it's not an advocation of It's an advocation to make sure there is no killing i believe

(39:51) in forced doctrine so the idea of like the idea of 5 foot one men attacking 7

(39:58) foot tall 300lb men doesn't seem that likely to me it seems like they

(40:04) generally won't do that right right so it seems like if you're a 7 foot 300 lb

(40:10) buff yolked out dude you're probably not going to get attacked and the whole idea

(40:15) behind that is because the person is worried that if they do attack you what happens they get they get messed up real

(40:22) bad right right so if you think if this is something that Trump could do why do

(40:27) you think he hasn't done it i don't I just don't think that he would be able to justify it politically okay why

(40:32) though because I think that there would be an outcry a general outcry against it

(40:37) and it could stress his powers like yeah I think it could be argued that this I

(40:43) I'm I'm not sure on this right but I it could possibly be argued as like you would need congressional authorization

(40:49) for this because of some reason possibly be they could defund it or there's any

(40:55) number of different reasons or there could be some type of like humanitarian crisis that it could be presented as

(41:01) that would cause a bunch of problems for him so there might be a bunch of practical reasons but I don't think that

(41:06) there's anything morally wrong with taking your army putting it on your

(41:11) border and telling people who try to cross that border that there's going to be dire consequences if they do okay

(41:19) yeah I think that's totally reasonable it's within the confines of reason it's logical it seems within force doctrine

(41:25) it would actually prevent more crossings and it would prevent more deaths ultimately yeah well I don't um I don't

(41:32) have a solution my own solution when it comes to immigration i think that uh topic is far too complicated for me and

(41:39) I don't know enough about how things work or politics uh to really come up

(41:45) with a solution but I I think the only other disagreement we had pertaining to that was that there were uh

(41:54) flights they were flying the immigrants in you thought that this was dubious that there was no evidence of it you

(41:59) didn't think this was actually a thing um I don't know if you still think that's the case but I I yeah I still

(42:06) think there were in fact flights hundreds of thousands illegal I don't

(42:11) know the precise number but there were Have you ever heard of the migrant caravans the what now migrant caravans i

(42:16) have heard of those okay yeah so that's tens of thousands of people whose entire objective was to go through South

(42:23) America and Mexico collecting as many people as possible in order to break into the country at a single point make

(42:29) a political statement the Democrats assured them that they would have hotel rooms that they would be taking care of

(42:34) they actually had Democrat liaison who went to South America and would coach these migrant caravan leaders um it was

() 

(42:41) a big cluster what we were talking about is

(42:47) uh I I think it was I think it was hundreds of thousands of immigrants

(42:52) being flown over into New York um and I

(42:57) just Why would they do that because it switches voting demographics

(43:04) but they can't vote well that's funny to that's funny that

(43:09) you should mention that but I'm not going to get into that on YouTube because of the terms of service but um

(43:15) the thing is is they can't work either but they work right right but voting is

(43:20) a little You need a social you're supposed to need a social work okay but

(43:26) to to sign up to vote though how do you do that without social you take your

(43:32) fake ass social that you got out of So what happens is here's what people do

(43:37) they go to a cemetery okay well they don't maybe they don't physically go right but what they do is they look

(43:43) through obituary records for somebody like let's say your name is um Javier Vuarez right and uh you're roughly 25

(43:51) years old and so you go through the obituaries and you find somebody whose name is like I don't know uh Rodrigo

(43:58) something or another and he's 22 right and he has roughly the same types of features that you do right you can apply

(44:05) get a death certificate you get the death certificate and then you can uh manipulate that in such a way to get a

(44:11) birth certificate you take the birth certificate down to the social security office say "I lost my social security card." They give you back your social

(44:17) security card then you go get a normal real state ID you have now assumed somebody else's identity are there

(44:24) statistics that show how many people that have passed away have voted in this

(44:30) last the problem is right is like they don't one they wouldn't count them as

(44:35) passed away because this is an active person who's not dead right but they did

(44:40) die though yeah they did die but that doesn't mean that they've been officially counted one and two when

(44:46) you're talking about the uh assumed identification uh they can also they're

(44:52) also going to be counted as a living person you can have conflicting records inside of our recordeping okay you know

(44:59) apparatuses and this happens often now how many there are liberals will tell you that there's very few cases like

(45:05) this but it's very very difficult to determine how many there actually are of cases like this very difficult because

(45:12) they've already assume the identity the person is dead okay right but it happens a lot more than people let on well it's

(45:19) just it's one of those things um I'm sure it happens and I'm sure it's

(45:24) happened but uh there's there's just no there's no stats on it there's no way to get stats on it so it's hard for me to

(45:31) though there is a way to get a stats on this okay that every single year 1

(45:36) million legal immigrants come into the United States how many illegal immigrants do you think are here uh I

(45:44) think probably five or six times the estimate that they say okay what what do they say the estimate is uh Brian have

(45:50) to pull it up officially 11 million million 11 million no no no no uh so

(45:56) Mick at the in the StreamYard it's in the actual

(46:01) browser do you see where it says private chat it's on primary monitor it's on

(46:10) your primary monitor it's selected do you see where it says private chat no no hold on so just switch this back to

(46:16) comments do you see that comments tab no no no no

(46:21) okay yeah we're on private chat look uh four up it says comments it there okay um now uh here

(46:31) I'm going to pull this up i don't think it pertains to how many illegal immigrants are in the country but this

(46:36) is from homeland.house.gov so this is uh

(46:42) Department of Homeland Security i believe this is their source hold on one sec guys i'm multitasking a dozen

(46:49) different things here uh so Mick I'm going to have you scroll down just a little bit new documents reveal airports used by Secretary Mayorcas to fly

(46:56) hundreds of thousands of inad inadmissible aliens into US via CHNV

(47:01) mass parole scheme scroll down chnv mean scroll

(47:07) down washington DC today the House Committee on Homeland Security revealed documents obtained through subpoena of

(47:13) the Department of Homeland Security DHS that identified over 50 airport locations including our nation's capital

(47:19) used by DHS to help process into the country more than 400,000 inadmissible

(47:24) aliens through the through the administration's unlawful Cuban Haitian

(47:30) Nicaraguan and Venezuelan mass parole program the program was officially launched in January 2023 and the

(47:36) documents obtained by the committee cover the period from January to August accounting for roughly 200,000 of these

(47:42) individuals uh according to these documents as of mid-occtober 2023 there were 1.6 million inadmissible aliens

(47:49) awaiting travel authorizations through this program scroll down quite a bit

(47:55) more uh keep going keep going so according to these

(48:00) documents scroll down scroll down scroll down scroll down the top 15 airport loc

(48:05) stop stop stop the top 15 airport locations used for the program and the number of inadmissible aliens who flew

(48:12) into a port of entry between January August 2023 were Miami 91,000 Fort

(48:17) Lauderdale 60,000 New York City 14,000 Houston uh 8,000 Orlando 6,000 Los

(48:24) Angeles 3,000 Tampa 3 thou etc etc scroll down a bit the the other airports

(48:29) used for the program okay that's fine uh and I mean that's pretty much it as it relates to the flights yeah and you can

(48:36) point out too that there was a a time period here during uh C19

(48:42) uh when when COVID was going on right where most of the ballots were mailin

(48:47) right and mail the mail and ballot system is like the worst idea

(48:52) ever conceived by man because the proofs there were uh very slight to have those

(48:59) votes counted so uh having having thousands of unsecured ballot locations

(49:05) right yeah this was Yeah they can definitely participate in the political process whether they are supposed to or

(49:11) not okay so that's I mean those are the

(49:16) arguments I guess there do you have a position on this at all or

(49:24) I don't think I have anything to contribute that hasn't already been said um so I don't feel like it's necessary

(49:31) for me to to jump in on that one are there any other topics that you feel

(49:37) more religion is her thing religion is there anything Okay we can do that

(49:43) with the flow though so are there any other people people often lose interest on the religion topic i'm just being

(49:50) honest with you we can keep it quick too also if that's a concern um I mean sex work is a topic that you know I'm

(49:57) passionate about but I'm not sure if that's a tired topic on this podcast why are you passionate about it

() 

(50:03) um well I think there are a lot of different viewpoints from different kinds of sex workers

(50:10) um on several different topics whether it comes to legalization or

(50:17) um what's the word I'm looking for kind of like a a control over that

(50:23) industry that we may or may not have depending on what the circumstances are

(50:29) such as places where it's legal like Nevada or whether we're looking at protection for people who work

(50:36) independently not necessarily on the street but like online and things like that oh I see what you're saying okay so

(50:43) you're making a distinction between um legislating it in multiple multiple

(50:49) ways right so you're talking about are we talking about protecting sex workers or this or that or Yeah there's there

(50:55) can be a lot of opposing viewpoints um I have the 100% number one way to protect

(51:00) sex workers ban them they don't be sex workers it's one what 100% effective

(51:06) wouldn't you agree not necessarily no um no i don't think I

(51:12) could answer that with just a yes or no um because I think there's slightly more nuance to it um I can only use where I

(51:19) work currently as an example um where we are very well protected um is there a

(51:25) chance though a chance for a chance for you to in some way be assaulted or uh

(51:31) something like this through the fact that you're a sex worker um well there's always that chance is

(51:37) there but there's a 100% chance that you're not going to be assaulted as a sex worker if you're not one right well

(51:43) I think as a woman there's always a chance right but it's not going to be based on the fact that you're in an

(51:49) industry where this is much more common than when you're not in the industry right

(51:57) i couldn't give you a percentage but that could be a fair statement depending oh yeah it's much more common assaults

(52:02) are sex workers of course yeah because I can only speak on where I work um you

(52:07) know the the security is great we all have business licenses we receive testing once a week

(52:13) were background checked by the county um whether that be a sheriff's department or a police department it depends on

(52:19) your Is this one of the ranches yeah okay gotcha so so the thing is is like

(52:25) um my understanding in those places they have like literal guard dogs that they patrol the perimeters with they have

(52:32) armed security and I don't know if that's true or not this is just what I'm told right so I'm sure security there is

(52:39) bar none fantastic do you ever go into a room with a John alone

(52:47) do you do that as part of your daily course i don't understand do when you go

(52:53) into a room with a John alone right is that part does that would would you consider that a routine part of your job

(53:00) yes yeah so then you're do you usually know these John's

(53:06) no no okay so so then what you're saying is is that yes this place is really well

(53:11) guarded until you go into a room by yourself with a John right and then you engage in sexual activity and your

(53:19) chances there of being abused obviously are significantly higher than if you were not in the room with the stranger

(53:24) having sex with them right yeah i would say it also depends on what

(53:30) kind of services you're offering as well that can make a big difference in why consider the odds but just like being in

(53:37) the room with the John doing anything sexual is going to increase your chances of being assaulted right that chance is

(53:44) always there yeah so I have a my 100% foolproof way to make sure that you

(53:50) because I care about you never get assaulted again is that you never do sex

(53:55) work and then I can guarantee that you'll never be in a room with a strange man again unless it's by some valition

(54:02) of your own not because you need money where that man will assault you what about Only Fans so what about it so I

(54:11) mean obviously there is a point uh in person sex work you're alone with

(54:17) a random man that can be scary um only fans though how can that be

(54:25) dangerous uh parasocial relationships so okay that So let's see

(54:31) if we can untangle this right i'm positive right in my streaming career I

(54:38) I have at least some people who probably have a parasocial relationship with me you know what that term means right

(54:45) uh there's nothing I can do about that that's going to come with the territory i take so the only thing I can do is be

(54:50) as responsible as I possibly can do or be by if such a relationship bubbles and

(54:57) I can see it by putting the kibos on it right saying things like I'm not your friend I'm not your buddy right I'm I'm

() 

(55:04) just an entertainer you happen to be a fan right this parasocial kind of relationship not that I haven't had fans

(55:09) that have become friends because they have right but I'm just saying generally speaking I try to put the kibos on that

(55:15) immediately right away from your angle though right a par a parasocial relationship is

(55:23) going to be way way more likely because of the nature because the nature of what you're doing so that puts you at a

(55:30) higher elevated risk in comparison to even other people in similar industries but I I also I don't use my um my name

(55:36) or anything my real name so um and do you think that would stop people i think

(55:42) it would make it a little bit harder sure um but I I mean I've been doing it for a while i think some people

(55:49) definitely do have a parasocial relationship with me i was just watching a story this morning uh there was a a

(55:56) guy I don't remember his name but he was like a bald dude and he developed a parasocial relationship with an Only

(56:02) Fans girl and he began to spend his family's credit card money i think I've seen that yeah yeah started spending his

(56:08) family's money on her he became completely obsessed he became totally iate and when they tried to put the

(56:14) kibos on the relationship he was so invested that he actually murders his entire family in order to continue this

(56:21) relationship right now I'm willing to grant right that there are musicians and

(56:27) other people out there who are so ridiculously famous that there's deranged fans who would do something

(56:33) similar with them and they're not in sex work i'm just stating that the chances of it are way higher in your industry

(56:40) and wouldn't that be part of my responsibility as well though like being

(56:45) on the internet to make sure these people don't get connected to me in that way or attached to me in that way cuz I

(56:51) I do try Well I think the nature of what you do is to try to create this kind of

(56:59) relationship literally on purpose so and this is all by the nature of the work

(57:05) itself it's not saying so I I'm gonna try to be charitable here i think you can you're You try to divorce yourself

(57:12) me the What's your name i'm sorry savannah savannah savannah savannah that

(57:18) Savannah the person is trying to divorce herself from Savannah the sex worker these are two different people when

(57:23) Savannah the sex worker is doing sex work that's not really who she is she's this whole other person who likes

(57:30) flowers and unicorns and pretty nails or whatever the it is right like whatever that person is is not this

(57:37) person but this person who does do the sex work is being provocative trying on

(57:43) purpose to be seductive trying on purpose in order to make a person feel a

(57:49) certain way a certain connection so that they open up their wallet and give you money okay right and I think that that

(57:55) is part of the nature of that work whereas for most other types of work um

(58:00) on camera film things like this that is not the case how is this different though because this is not designed to

(58:07) seduce this is not designed to introduce the parasocial aspect in it's much more

(58:13) straightforward so like uh assume a Hollywood actor is really straightforward too i'm providing you

(58:18) entertainment i get paid right i'm not really here to I'm I am trying to elicit

(58:25) emotions in you but the emotions aren't specifically the idea of I'm seducing

(58:30) you and creating the context that there's something here between us that's that's the feeling I'm trying to

(58:37) introduce like in your sex work for instance um do you ever moan really loud

(58:43) do you ever pretend that you're really into it when you're not do you ever you know the answer is likely yes right

(58:51) i actually um do a lot of different kinds of services that actually lean far

(58:57) more towards um trying to be careful with my wording

(59:03) um kink centered I would say sure um it's far less of you know the standard

(59:10) stereotypical for me personally but are you pretending on purpose to enjoy things maybe you don't

(59:16) enjoy you're pretending to be into those things when you're not really into them because you're trying to elicit a

(59:21) response from the person they're that gives into whatever their fantasy is right um me personally no because I

(59:31) don't offer any kind of service that I wouldn't enjoy delivering on um I do

(59:36) have that luxury i don't speak for everyone i only speak for myself so you've never pretended to be more into

(59:41) it than you're not than you are i have to oh okay well you would agree though that at least in your industry that

(59:50) women are going to be moaning they're going to be like screaming at the top of their lungs they're going to be doing things like this even though they

(59:56) ordinarily Yeah i'm sure it happens with you too whether you admit it or not but that aside

() 

(1:00:02) yeah coming Yeah coming back to this the idea here is that you're specifically trying to get those responses right

(1:00:09) whereas I think that other forms of entertainment specifically are not trying to develop the parasocial aspect

(1:00:16) i can I totally agree uh about the safetiness of it but um I think taking

(1:00:23) measures to make sure that in case anything happens you can protect

(1:00:28) yourself i think um I mean whether regardless of if I did sex work or not I would want to have that protection yeah

(1:00:36) so um I don't feel any less safe doing it but I

(1:00:41) uh but I get to be at home so yeah but I mean you these are well like

(1:00:48) these are tiered arguments right so the first tier is the safety of even the

(1:00:53) prostitute in this case right and of the John are paramount we got the we have the overarching STDs which are in this

(1:01:00) industry which including over fan only fans have an over representation of STDs

(1:01:05) cons uh against the general public why because they do BG GG content right and often times they're not as rigorously

(1:01:12) even tested as the people in the corn industry are when they do that sort of content so uh then we have to compete

(1:01:18) with that with the uh amount of STDs that come in then we have to deal with the trafficking that comes in with this

(1:01:24) and then all I mean the list just is like endless of the societal ills that

(1:01:29) come with sex work whereas banning it what really what bad happens when we ban

(1:01:35) this that there's a black market potentially that opens up for it well I think I I think South Korea is a good

(1:01:43) example of what happens when you do ban porn it's not really banned there i know

(1:01:49) officially it is but it's not actually but I think they they have higher rates of uh rape and sexual assault and they

(1:01:57) also have the law there than than what the United States definitely not

(1:02:02) okay yeah definitely not i mean I do we can I mean I could be wrong i'm willing

(1:02:08) to concede if I'm wrong because we're talking about stats off the top of our head but can you look at the It's hard to things up yeah I see i see okay i'm

(1:02:16) willing to concede if I'm wrong on that but I would find it like kind of stunning if it was the case or if that

(1:02:23) that was the case and there wasn't at least underlying reasons for it that aren't as obvious as what you're

(1:02:28) portraying right okay so but yeah it is true that in South Korea it is banned

(1:02:34) but it's not IP banned really right so people can still access it when they want it's a very westernized nation

(1:02:41) right and and I would even argue that absent feminism and the the various

(1:02:46) herbivore movements that are going on in these Asian nations what do they call it now not herbivore the um

(1:02:53) isn't that the term herbivore well that's for Japan but they whatever where

(1:02:59) women are checking out and men are checking out of the Department of Relationship period because they don't

(1:03:04) want to be with these feminists that you probably wouldn't see that sort yeah you probably Yeah yeah there you go that you

(1:03:10) probably wouldn't see that sort of consumption um you know even the IP ban

(1:03:16) consumption you probably wouldn't see that so there's other things that are going on in South Korea which I would

(1:03:21) contribute to uh other crises which are happening there not not because of not just corn being banned yeah that's

(1:03:28) actually a very popular position there by the way to keep it banned like people reintroduce trying to get it uh approved

(1:03:34) again and it just gets smacked down every time so yeah I think that there could be uh some regulations when it

(1:03:41) comes to uh corn in America um okay well

(1:03:46) maybe we can get agreement then okay so maybe we can find some agreement here here's here's my perfect compromise plan

() 

(1:03:54) right you have to show ID you have to upload ID in order to get on

(1:04:00) a corn website i agree have to i agree okay period and uh it needs to there

(1:04:08) needs to be some sort of verification there for that yeah you agree with that yeah I do agree with that what do you

(1:04:14) think will happen to the market though well the the thing is that uh Only Fans already does that so nobody can get on

(1:04:21) to my Only Fans unless they upload their ID that says that they're 18 plus so um

(1:04:26) but as for Pornhub and that I I don't know i've I've the age the next thing I

(1:04:32) would implement is that at the very least the age of sex work needs to start at 26 26 yeah so if we began alcohol if

(1:04:41) we if we raise the age of alcohol to 21 this is arbitrary but we just think well

(1:04:46) you're probably not at responsible enough to have a drink or a cigarette until you're 21 we can kind of

(1:04:52) arbitrarily set it forward from there right i think that this is a huge decision that 18 19 20 21 year olds

(1:04:59) probably shouldn't make so let's make it 26 okay would that work um no no not

(1:05:06) going to like that part well I I see where you're coming from but I um I do

(1:05:12) think when it comes to stuff like Only Fans like that has not been detrimental to my career my schooling or anything uh

(1:05:20) and I started that when I was um 20 or 21 yeah but it's not about you well yeah

(1:05:26) but obviously this is it affects you my example but it affects me it affects him

(1:05:32) it affects everybody right all societal ripples are that way so right the question is is like should I have a say

(1:05:39) yes and so my say is is like if we can't outright ban it which I would prefer

(1:05:45) right then we can set in such rigors to it that it greatly reduces the consumption of it okay i I agree with

(1:05:53) the ID verification mhm but not the age going up no I but I I do see where

(1:06:00) you're coming from though um you know people that get into it the day they turn 18 it's Yeah yeah no

(1:06:07) problem um but you know I just people are they are

(1:06:13) allowed to make their own choices and it is what it is you know no we don't let

(1:06:19) people make their own choices if they're bad for society we we regulate all the time okay i just I don't see that i

(1:06:25) don't see a 21-year-old making contact i don't see that if you

(1:06:31) knew a product was poisonous but it just killed a person slowly over time alcohol

(1:06:37) right well if sure let's even take that okay right if if your like 18-year-old

(1:06:43) son wanted alcohol would you tell him he should have it yeah he can have a little

(1:06:49) I mean yeah you can have the nonpoisonous dose right well you can have a beer well well sure but this is

(1:06:54) the my rebuttal for this is that every person that consumes corn they have the

(1:07:01) responsibility to consume it in a decent amount they totally their responsibility

(1:07:07) to not get corn rot yeah but here's the thing that's funny it's like I can agree with you and at the same time still be

(1:07:13) right so I I'll explain so I agree with you that the consumer also has responsibility just like the producer

(1:07:20) right but which one's way more easy to regulate the millions of consumers or

(1:07:25) the few producers right i mean that's that's true but it's

(1:07:31) it's all the same with alcohol though i know people Mhm are alcoholics but it's

(1:07:37) it's their fault you know we're not going to ban alcohol because But what happens but what do we see with alcohol

(1:07:42) well what happens we see national campaigns everywhere don't drink and drive don't consume this this is poisonous this is bad for you we're not

(1:07:49) allowed to advertise it on television you're not allowed to you know what I mean you can't advertise it here you can't put it on YouTube you can't you

(1:07:56) know what I mean there's all sorts of various things um and all sorts of restrictions and massive national

() 

(1:08:02) campaigns you have mothers against drunk driving the penalties for drunk driving are through the roof you know what I

(1:08:08) mean you get additional penalties you wouldn't even get if you were perhaps stoned or something else in certain

(1:08:13) states right we have huge campaigns against this where's that for corn nowhere the the examples that you're

(1:08:21) bringing up drinking and driving people do die from that um people die from this as well i just gave

(1:08:29) you an example of a person who had a parasocial relationship he do off his entire family but not only that um these

(1:08:36) behaviors ultimately aren't just for drinking and driving the national campaigns against the behavior

(1:08:42) themselves drinking is not great right it's not something there there's open container laws everywhere like

(1:08:49) everything that you see in society is is stigmatizing alcohol except in a small

(1:08:54) case use specific type of thing you know what I mean and that's at the national level now maybe there would be a good

(1:09:01) point from prostitutes if they were like "Look this is stigmatized at the national level and people still want to

(1:09:06) do it at least there would be some resistance but it's like it's just glorified where is the state glorifying

(1:09:13) alcohol nowhere well I don't know if I would say that it's glorified i think it's heavily censored." Like I mean it's

(1:09:19) totally glorified you can't just You can't have people making corn on the side of the road like you that's not

(1:09:25) allowed that's not legal like I there are there are things put in place yeah

(1:09:32) there's there's there's restrictions which existed pre the corn industry for

(1:09:37) public decency that's true but when you're talking about what are we doing on a societal level to push back against

(1:09:43) it societies use stigmatization and things like this in order to push out behavior that we don't like we do this

(1:09:50) at a national level all the time so if you want to see more LGBTQ people what do you do you have

(1:09:56) LGBTQ awareness month and you have all sorts of like pro propaganda or that

(1:10:01) again negative connotation on the word propaganda but everybody knows what the word means right you would have tons of propaganda towards LGBTQ you'd have tons

(1:10:08) of propaganda towards those things reinforcing that they're good they're good this is good we want more of this

(1:10:13) good good good good you see it all over the news it's good it's good that helps propagate that into the ethos is this is

(1:10:20) behavior which we consider to be acceptable and decent and we want to see more of it the opposition to that would

(1:10:28) be if you had like pro- family and pro- you know nuclear family and and

(1:10:35) pro-atriarchy propaganda or stuff like this right you'd see a lot more of that so uh we adjust our conditionals based

(1:10:42) on uh what we see as as stigmatization or not when I when I look at alcohol it

(1:10:48) seems like everything moves towards stigmatization everything moves towards don't be a drunk don't be doing this

(1:10:54) this is not good right i have to read a couple chats so we have

(1:11:00) uh guys if you want read is 100 TTS is 200 uh Spawny we do these at intervals

(1:13:09) remember well of course you remember uh P Priscilla the girl who attacked

(1:13:16) Andrew we were going to do I I'll just spoil it so on third what we were going

(1:13:26) DJ panel uh me and Andrew and Desiree me and Andrew Desiree and

(1:13:54) Priscilla you want her to come and crash and then we'll have her join the panel and uh what do you think chat but I

(1:14:01) think uh in order to do that Andrew do we need a champagne pop or what do you think i think we should get one at least

(1:14:06) one at least one champagne pop the chat is mixed so I'm reading the chat now

(1:14:17) It's not a democracy no yes yes no it's not a democracy um Well guys so it

(1:14:23) wouldn't be Desiree tonight uh but it would be Priscilla so and then there's

(1:14:29) also the girl with uh the the with the

(1:14:35) dyslexia the girl who was sitting right there on last episode we She's also

(1:14:40) still in town so maybe we could have her Lord have her what do you think chat should should we have Priscilla and then

(1:14:47) what was her name the What was the girl jen should we have her just IQ of like

(1:14:52) 140 the 140 IQ maybe we can have her uh but we're going to need a champagne pop

(1:14:59) doesn't have to be crystalall just regular champagne pop i think we're going to need a champagne pop for that one so if you

(1:15:05) want for if you want to see a confrontation us confront Priscilla on

(1:15:13) her assault of Andrew of her you know that's pretty bad oh pretty bad oh

(1:15:22) pretty awful for Champagne Pop we will bring Priscilla here right now and spice

(1:15:29) up the tonight's show a little bit uh so yeah um Spyro Spiro can I have you read

(1:15:35) this one for me uh Sav speaking of immigration there's one country that will never ever ever be able to send

(1:15:42) illegal immigrants Australia because it's not real correct

(1:15:48) rattlesnake rattlesnake in shambles shambles all right thank you Spyro lying

(1:15:54) round earthers uh can you read this one too he sent in another one uh speaking

(1:15:59) of immigration I'm surprised Brixen is against it think of all the illegals that could make burritos for him under

(1:16:06) the table so I'm actually listen Andrew is not going to like me for that or maybe I don't know i'll know his position on this i am in favor of

(1:16:13) illegal immigration as follows women between the ages of 18 and

(1:16:22) 29 who are uh who are athletes gymnasts pull

(1:16:29) vters swimmers nuts i won't accept softball

(1:16:35) players from other countries but I will accept What about yoga enthusiasts i will accept yoga enthusiasts but uh you

(1:16:42) know track and field is acceptable not the long distance chips most the most

(1:16:47) degenerate immigration policy I've ever heard what are you talking about they're not sex workers Andrew they're they're

(1:16:53) athletes uhhuh just Just bring them all in female illegal immigrant athletes

(1:16:59) i'll accept from all uh Eastern Europe would be good some Eastern European gymnasts very fit um I will

(1:17:07) accept from you know what we we're going to prioritize uh Eastern European we're

(1:17:13) going to Asian countries Western we can even Hey Western European why not i know what you're thinking i can see it in

(1:17:19) your eyes you're thinking that's racist no it's not he He specifically ruled out Western

(1:17:25) Europe specifically ruled it out that's not what I was thinking i'm okay with Western Europe but Eastern Europe first

(1:17:32) okay and you're also okay with like Mexican chicks latin America acceptable okay but the I prefer you know like

(1:17:40) let's start just just to make things a bit more fair the like the South

(1:17:45) American first well you want Eastern European first

(1:17:51) right because the South American South Americans are already coming in droves if Yeah so so we want to make it fair

(1:17:58) right i'm saying like if if Mexico is Central America right is it that's or is it part of North

(1:18:05) America is wait is Mexico Central America or North America

(1:18:13) what isn't it central America i can't tell if nobody's answering no it's definitely North Mexico's North America

(1:18:20) wait hold on let me Google it's North America no I know where Mexico is i just

(1:18:25) don't know if it's categorized as Central America is Is Mexico still going to be a part of one

(1:18:32) of the two continents right it is cons it is North America yeah it's North America

(1:18:39) it's not I know it's not South America but I was wondering if it was the distinction if it was Central America

(1:18:44) because Central America you got like Costa Rica Nicaragua

(1:18:49) uh Panama Guatemala what's the other one or uh I'm

(1:18:58) I'm terrible with geography man i wouldn't I would Honduras el Salvador that's like s Okay

(1:19:03) okay that's gonna get clipped so um yeah but I'm thinking like

(1:19:11) Argentina i'm thinking like Argentina let's bring some gymnasts pvault like

(1:19:17) Argentinian gymnasts and then we move our way up we get to like Costa Rica we

(1:19:22) can bring then we can get to Mexico with their ath female sorry female only

(1:19:28) athletes and gymnasts and so forth makes sense uh so there's that okay let's see

(1:19:34) if there's uh Okay so guys uh really quick read 100 TTS 200 if you want

(1:19:40) Priscilla if you want her to come we're gonna we're gonna have a have a uh a sit

(1:19:47) down with her we're going to have a combo uh sh We got sh We need a champagne pop for that like the video

(1:19:53) like the video guys twitch.tv whatever discord.gg whatever uh and then uh let's

(1:20:00) see here you don't think Brian's too mean to the girls on the show they love the show they're big fans i

(1:20:06) think I it does depend on uh if they're mean to him that's true which I guess

(1:20:11) I've only seen clips of like them yelling at each other so I was like "Ah he sucks you know?" Well I've noticed this I've noticed this really funny

(1:20:18) thing right so um I've been working in industrial

(1:20:23) circles my whole adult life right so when I go in to do a job that's just

(1:20:29) what I'm used to so Brian you'll see Brian he kind of very sharp with his language like can you be quiet right now

(1:20:35) because we're doing X right things like this for me right i just think of it as this

(1:20:42) guy is the foreman he's doing what he's supposed to be doing you know what I mean right and I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing i never took But

(1:20:49) I've noticed that women have a really hard time with that well I know you're

(1:20:54) going to hate it but it's it's tone policing it really is totally it's the

(1:20:59) way it's the way you say it if you say it with like a little bit of

(1:21:05) oomph do you think that that could be like possibly what the pay gap is the gender pay gap is because women can't

(1:21:10) handle tone like they just can't handle it and so employers employers are

(1:21:16) like you know I think we're just going to hire men for this and pay them more and incentivize them because then I

(1:21:22) can talk to them how I need to talk to them without them like crying and whining about tone totally that's

(1:21:28) what I think okay i'm memeing i don't really think that but I just think it's funny i just think it's funny

(1:21:36) uh you got anything for us you got Cuz you're like DM'd us i want to be her

(1:21:42) debate partner waiting for a little I felt like it would be a little bit unfair for her

(1:21:47) to be on here by herself yes that's true well originally it was just going to be a one v one so I doubled it

(1:21:55) up because yell at him i offered to and you never responded

(1:22:04) wait what i said we could yell at each other if you want but I'm not just going to do that for no reason

(1:22:12) wait I'm not sure what you're talking about when I asked for the address and I was like "Also we can yell at each other

(1:22:18) if you want like we can have beef for entertainment purposes we don't stage stuff all the beef is natural okay

(1:22:27) but originally you were like "Hey I want to be her debate partner what do you want to debate?"

(1:22:32) She's good with religion she knows a lot about Yeah i'm not really sure how the structure works given I could only watch

(1:22:38) so many episodes at a time before getting here so I'm just kind of waiting to be prompted yeah in this format it's

(1:22:45) open it's an open debate because like during a panel it's not because there's

(1:22:50) so many people and you're getting to you know and and it's not even designed necessarily to to be a debate there's

(1:22:57) going to be some debate that happens but it's not always designed for debate at all it's just designed for people most

(1:23:03) of the clips I've seen it was with the panel so I think I got a little confused and I don't want to interrupt anyone

(1:23:09) either um like letting your conversation Yeah that was fine i didn't feel the need to butt in on that because I I felt

(1:23:15) a lot of good things were being said so is religion something we can discuss or

(1:23:21) is that boring for you guys we don't have I'm not a religious debater andrew

(1:23:27) is probably a bit more wellversed in that what are your criticisms of religion you said it was delusional

(1:23:34) um yeah I would definitely say so i think it is wildly illogical to me from

(1:23:40) my perspective um I don't understand personally why um a god that seems to

(1:23:48) glorify suffering to earn peace and eternal life um you know why what's

(1:23:55) deserving of worship what's but this is a problem is like you use religious

() 

(1:24:01) terms in order to uh criticize religion like when you say say words like

(1:24:07) suffering how do you account for suffering suffering just means that you don't like that's it that's all

(1:24:13) suffering means i can narrow it down a little bit i mean if I You're going to narrow You will but you're just going to

(1:24:18) narrow it down to subjective experiences I don't like or don't prefer i think I

(1:24:24) think And if you if you if that's not what it narrows down to I'm going to be stunned but I'm going to let you narrow it down so what is suffering

(1:24:32) i would say the the suffering I was more referring to would be suffering that I

(1:24:37) believe is more unjust not just because someone made a bad decision or messed up

(1:24:45) i'm more referring to um children and cancer and horrific things like that um

(1:24:53) the most common thing that I've ever been told is everything happens for a reason and if this terrible thing

(1:24:59) happens to this young child leukemia things like that um that it was all

(1:25:05) God's will and I I personally don't understand that whatsoever because what

(1:25:12) has such a young child done to deserve any kind of That's really strange that you you're in uh you you were raised

(1:25:19) Catholic yes and they told you it's in God's will yes that people get cancer

(1:25:27) it's all part of God's plan oh I see okay well the problem is again so

(1:25:35) all of the criticisms that you would come up with for religion right you have to account for all of them so when you

(1:25:41) say words like just it's loaded like what is justice well I can give you two forms of justice there's a Christian

(1:25:48) form of justice you're probably more used to like empathy oh you came in and

(1:25:55) you stole a bunch of from my house is it then just for me to go and steal a bunch of from your house

(1:26:02) no no that's really weird though because I can give you a completely alternative

(1:26:08) view of justice that seems like it's totally within the confines of reason if you steal from my house for me to be

(1:26:14) able to steal from yours that seems completely within the line of reason seems totally logical to me there's

(1:26:19) nothing illogical about it there's no violations of the laws of logic right it's well within reason what's the

(1:26:26) problem the problem is is you just don't prefer that kind of justice right sure

(1:26:32) i'm also not 100% clear on some of the differences between Catholic and Christian teachings you know I can say

(1:26:39) Catholics are Christians i would say I've been told by a few people that

(1:26:45) there's like some different teachings or how they're interpreted personally so totally people will not consider them to

(1:26:50) be Christians yes that's true non-denom so I would just largely chop it up to

(1:26:56) three there'd be I chop it up this way okay most Orthodox would just say

(1:27:01) everything that's not orthodox is Protestant but I just chop it up to there is Protestantism these are the all

(1:27:09) of the branches of the of Christianity which came from Martin Luther after the schism and then there's Catholicism

(1:27:16) which came from Orthodoxy after the schism then there's Orthodoxy the original church of Christ so that's how

(1:27:22) I would view it right so how do you uh I mean I've I've read most of the Old

(1:27:28) Testament i haven't finished it um some of the new one but when it comes to

(1:27:34) science and religion I know that's always like such a an annoying topic but how do you justify the

(1:27:40) Bible through that well science doesn't make science can't make claims about the

(1:27:47) metaphysical like science science can't tell you if there there are not ghosts

(1:27:53) no it can only it can only test whether or not there are or not ghosts here

(1:27:59) right but but it's not going to make ought claims right it's not going to make any It just doesn't test for that

(1:28:06) so right if if I wanted so so if you're doing a scientific experiment it's got to be falsifiable right that's what

(1:28:12) makes it so the thing is is um we're going to start with an observation in

(1:28:18) this case you're going to observe you think there's a ghost let's say you think there's one right so then your

(1:28:24) hypothesis is like I don't know uh there's an ethereal realm and this person hasn't passed on yet right

(1:28:31) something like this and then you're going to conduct an experiment let's say you go and you get equipment and you

(1:28:36) come up with electronic voice phenomenon right and you're trying to catch the spirit's voice on that or some

(1:28:42) right so you can even say like ghost hunting could be a rigorous scientific endeavor it doesn't sound like one

(1:28:48) though does it you know what I mean it's it's it's not really designed to to

(1:28:53) answer those kinds of questions that's not what it's there to do i just mean in terms of like it says the Earth was

(1:29:00) created 6,500 years ago or something m um well that's young earth creationism

(1:29:08) but the thing is part of the thing is is like uh there are people who fight over

(1:29:13) young earth or old old earth creation i've always considered it to be a silly fight to have because it really has

(1:29:19) nothing to do with the with the point so uh the Bible warns us not to uh adhere

(1:29:26) to endless genealogies so that we don't get bogged down in nonsensical questions like that right it's just not that

(1:29:32) important from the Christian purview whether the earth is 6,000 years old or not well maybe not but the point is that

(1:29:38) it is older than 6,000 years so there there is really no argument when it comes to that which is just one example

(1:29:46) of something in the Bible that I mean when they wrote it they had no understanding of like geoysical

(1:29:53) sciences so they well they you know they understood a lot more than people think like I hear people say they didn't

(1:30:00) really understand things very well but and one of the things I hear all the time is like "Well they didn't

(1:30:05) understand where babies came from." It's like "But the whole Old Testament is filled with his seed will go into her."

(1:30:11) You know what I mean and I'm like "I think they kind of got where babies came from." But what about like when they

(1:30:17) said that plant life was made before the sun that was before we had an

(1:30:22) understanding of Genesis of photosynthesis yeah i don't I don't know what the exact verbiage is in Genesis

(1:30:28) for which which in the creation story which thing came first was plant life and then sun okay

(1:30:35) sure i mean I don't know if that's the case i'd have to pull up Genesis in order for me to contextualize it but I'm

(1:30:42) just saying like again these seem like the least important questions like let's even say that the accounting of that was

(1:30:50) was incorrect or just an allegory or something like that i don't believe it was i think it's both actually true and

(1:30:55) it's allegorically true and it is also um trying to convey like various lessons

(1:31:03) and this kind of thing right right um but let's just say for the sake of argument that that was not actually the

(1:31:10) case how does that really contradict with Christian ethics ultimately i don't think it contradicts the ethics but I

(1:31:17) think that it makes uh the Bible like illogical like it makes it not as I I

(1:31:25) just I wouldn't trust it for Mhm anything i mean mor morality wise I

(1:31:31) think um that it had some good ideas maybe the new one yeah but when people

(1:31:38) are making moral claims about religion they're not referencing whether or not you think it's it's logical what what

(1:31:45) happened in Genesis or the parting of the sea or things like that they're not that's not really what it's testing for

(1:31:51) when it comes to Christian ethics and Christians are making moral claims right so what is it testing for well Christians are are taking the virtues

(1:31:58) and the teachings of Jesus Christ and what they're doing is they're uh they're

(1:32:03) taking these these concepts and combining them into an ethical system called Christian ethics okay they're

(1:32:09) making ought prescriptions on that right so even my argument would just always be

(1:32:14) because I'm not a Christian apologist there's people way better at that than me for the accounting stories and things

(1:32:19) like that but my argument is always just like even if morality is subjective

(1:32:25) Christian ethics clearly has a ton of value even to consequentialists it seems to have a ton of value so even if it is

(1:32:31) the case that Christians were delusional like you said it seems like you would want them to be because they're they're

(1:32:37) super charitable super charitable and they I don't think they're bad yeah exactly and they keep society they keep

(1:32:44) society rolling right so even if it was the case that you thought they were living in a delusion like who cares from

(1:32:50) your view it's like they should probably live in that delusion it's probably better that they live in that delusion

(1:32:55) see I think that uh I think that religion can be really good for people give them a sense of purpose um but I

(1:33:04) think that something I've said before is that I think it's um it's like a betrayal of intellect to not let

(1:33:11) yourself question the how or the why of the creation of the universe yeah but I

(1:33:17) mean in the skeptic tradition you should be questioning skepticism too and the fact that you can't give an accounting

(1:33:22) for any of the things that you actually care about like justice justice is your preference right uh the idea of justice

(1:33:29) is your preference the idea of fairness is your preference the idea of basically everything is your preference shouldn't you be skeptical of that too

(1:33:37) i don't think you answered my question what's the question um what was my question i What did I say i don't know

(1:33:45) oh I I didn't I didn't I'm not trying to deflect from any questions no no no i lost it yeah so but I'm just saying that

(1:33:53) I think I think ultimately even from the viewpoint of the secularist or the

(1:33:59) subjective atheist or whatever the secular humanist that the most amount of value that people get is from

(1:34:04) Christianity anyway because they can give you objective unchanging accountings of things and you basically

(1:34:11) necessarily say things need to change well I think that it's just important sorry go ahead um here before uh here

(1:34:20) Nick Mick can you pull up the tweets we're going to switch topics what happened yeah religion is not a

(1:34:26) thing that Yeah we get bogged down on too much oh okay pull up the tweets

(1:36:47) that originally your tweet no no that's a different Anna okay okay let's um do

(1:36:52) uh control tab over yes i thought that that was a really stupid tweet

(1:36:59) grown men who pursued What's talking about i don't know i mean is this just I

(1:37:04) was just Is this related to age gap like men who date like 19year-olds because they're technically teenagers are you

(1:37:10) talking like about under like minors yeah I would I would

(1:37:16) assume i don't remember exactly what post this was on but I'm talking about like minors whenever I Next we're going

(1:37:23) to get into Next uh yes my dad knows I do Only Fans the Intels are going to hate this but

(1:37:28) the loves me supports okay um next these were just some of the tweets from last

(1:37:34) time who we talking about today men

(1:37:39) next telling sex workers that nobody will love them because their job is so cruel it's a job i don't think

(1:37:45) that's cruel i think like I don't think that's a cruelty i think that that's a

(1:37:51) descriptive reality i don't think it is i think it is well it's not nobody i

(1:37:56) wouldn't put anything in a monolith i would say less people okay that's fair that's a lot a

(1:38:02) significantly uh a significant amount of people less so like I think that it'll limit the amount of romantic partners in

(1:38:08) the future that would be available to you i think it would limit the types of family dynamics that you would normally

(1:38:14) be able to have with people that you wouldn't be able to have it creates stresses on parents and it creates

(1:38:19) stresses on siblings and it creates stresses on all sorts of people i agree

(1:38:24) but to say they're unlovable I don't agree with that to say they're what they're unlovable i do not agree with

(1:38:30) that well no i mean there's going to be people who love like your parents are

(1:38:35) probably going to love you even if they disagree even if they disowned you they probably would still love you i'm just

(1:38:41) saying I don't think it's cruel okay i think it's descriptive to say like maybe

(1:38:46) not all that's maybe fair but it's descriptive to say that way less people are going to uh I think it's a cruel

() 

(1:38:53) thing to say just because uh sex workers are aware of that i mean I've been very

(1:38:58) open about the fact that it is harder to date with an only fans um but I think

(1:39:05) it's unnecessary to point those things out it just seems like berating for no reason no well there's good reason for

(1:39:11) it the re the reason is the promotion of stigma so again society only has so many

(1:39:17) ways that it can push behavior or not push behavior and I think that everybody's essentially always trying to

(1:39:24) push their worldview all the time for the most part I think they are i just think that the religious are as

(1:39:29) justified as anybody else in doing that okay and when it comes to stigmatization I think that stigmatizing things that we

(1:39:35) don't like is perfectly acceptable and we do it constantly here's a good example of that smoking now I'm a smoker

(1:39:43) and that's heavily stigmatized right you're not allowed to smoke in restaurants anymore you can't smoke on

(1:39:48) planes now you never could when when I became a smoker but you can smoke in restaurants and bars and you can smoke

(1:39:53) basically wherever the hell you want now you can basically smoke nowhere mhm you know you can smoke a couple of places

(1:39:59) away from everybody that's it the whole behavior is stigmatized right and it's based on your effect of other people and

(1:40:05) their perception of it it's the same thing with sex work it's based on the effect and people's perception okay so I

(1:40:13) think it's totally fair for people to do that i think it's open game right stigmatization well I think they can do

(1:40:18) that but I do think it's cruel so um I mean I guess on on that uh I mean you do

(1:40:24) of you're not doing like traditional adult content you're not escorting

(1:40:29) you're not a cortisan you are um do you uh how long have you been working as a

(1:40:36) cortisan [Music] um mid

(1:40:43) 2022 or three i can't remember off the top of my head right now you've been at it for a little bit and how old are you

(1:40:48) again i'm 27 27 were you doing any kind of sex work before 2023 um online stuff

(1:40:56) like there's online cam sites things like that did you do adult uh content

(1:41:02) i've never done corn before recently like that there's like live cams that

(1:41:08) was more of a thing a couple years ago personal cam solo cam stuff okay like chatterbait or whatever yeah

(1:41:16) like that um and so when did you start doing that i can't recall off the top of my head um

(1:41:23) did you do any stripping have you stripped okay so you started Don't they strip inside those things inside those

(1:41:29) They can but not everybody does but you weren't in the strip club okay so you've been doing uh I uh uh I don't really

(1:41:37) know what escorting well it's not an escort have you ever done like Have you

(1:41:43) done street walking no like where you're on the street corner you haven't done that or anything but you do work at a

(1:41:49) ranch um how many uh and you said you started in 2023 I believe so do you recall which month

(1:41:56) uh summer uh so like two I couldn't tell you the exact month two to three you've

(1:42:01) been doing it for two years about Yeah I'd say that's a big bet sure okay and how many uh how often do you work

(1:42:08) um it can wildly depend i would say usually um once a month or every other month you only work once a month well

(1:42:16) you only work once a month for for two weeks at a time oh I misunderstood your question you stay on site yes okay when

(1:42:23) I typically I'm thinking like in terms of days um Yeah you got to change your

(1:42:29) mindset slightly because this is this is the legitimate brothel right yeah so

(1:42:37) but I Okay so you work two weeks on two weeks off or pretty much yeah Ideally it

(1:42:43) depends on the time of year okay um and that's been your pretty consistent schedule for the past two

(1:42:49) years I would say so yes okay how many people do you see per day that can wildly depend also it can be zero it can

(1:42:59) be one two three it's not a crazy number what's the most you've ever seen per day

(1:43:05) oh I don't know um for wildly different things maybe three or four people but

(1:43:11) that's not all the same services and do you ever do any group stuff like a couple comes in they want to sleep with

(1:43:16) you uh a group have do they allow like groups of like they want to do a gang

(1:43:25) um well something like that I think you would probably have to talk to the

(1:43:30) manager about i've never had that request before so I have done couples okay have you done a thrpple like three

(1:43:37) people come in and you sleep with all of them no I've never had that happen to me personally

(1:43:42) okay um and so some days you don't work at all and I'm assuming you get paid per

(1:43:50) uh encounter we're independent contractors so we can set our own price for what it is the person or people are

(1:43:57) looking for and that price is what you specifically is it like a barber shop where you basically just rent out a room

(1:44:04) there you pay them a fee to rent out the room and then you get your own clients or do they take a cut how does it work

(1:44:11) um there's room and board um there but there's also like specialty rooms that have like a hot tub in it or something

(1:44:19) um that you can also utilize um for bookings that would require such a thing

(1:44:24) so you have your own room but there's also rooms you can use that are on site if that makes sense but do you uh do

(1:44:31) they procure the clients or do you or is it both um it's both okay and they get a

(1:44:38) cut of the total price um there there's a percentage that's a cut but it goes towards to you know keeping the lights

(1:44:44) on it's a giant building and the water bill it's like paying utilities and rent basically

(1:44:50) okay and what is the like what what do you charge is it like 30 minutes or how

(1:44:56) how does it work i can't give like an exact number um it's just a legality that I have to follow working in a place

(1:45:03) like this but um it can totally depend there are people who come in and they say "I only need 15 minutes." And that's

(1:45:11) totally fine and there are some people who say "I want to spend three hours." Do you have discretion negotiation

(1:45:17) wait I'm sorry what do you have discretion with negotiation or is there a set minimum that the house requires

(1:45:22) it's completely up to me um there is like a small standard when it comes to

(1:45:28) certain things like if you want to use one of the big specialty rooms with the hot tub they prefer it to be over a

(1:45:35) certain dollar amount simply because you're utilizing that and then blocking it off for anybody else so um when it

(1:45:42) comes to the tweet I get I'm just asking some questions here um are you currently

(1:45:47) dating anybody i am you're in a relationship with a man a woman a man a

(1:45:52) man okay is he also a sex worker um he appears in some of my online stuff

(1:45:58) but he does not work um as a corn star or anything you have an Only Fans i do yeah has he ever worked with another

(1:46:05) girl on Her Only Fans or is this the first time he's been involved in sex work um I believe this is the first time

(1:46:12) okay is he uh is he a what's it called a gigalo or what is it the male jigalow

(1:46:17) i'm not familiar with that term is he a male prostitute no like does he work at at the ranch I work at there is one

(1:46:23) there is a male um separate i've But aren't they usually gay i know i've never had the opportunity

(1:46:30) wait so uh he uh so you're in a How long have you been

(1:46:35) dating him about a almost a year I think a year so yeah uh you had been doing uh

(1:46:43) the cordisen brothel stuff for a year when you met him basically okay uh did

(1:46:49) you how did you meet him um at a bar i think it was like a a bar and grill bar

(1:46:55) and did you guys like hook up that night or No we didn't okay yeah we had a nice conversation yeah and he like got your

(1:47:00) number and you guys set up a date for another day um did you disclose to him that night that you were a prostitute i

(1:47:07) did you told him yeah i'm actually I've been very lucky to never struggle with dating throughout any of my sex work

(1:47:14) endeavors so you see significantly older no no same age only like he's roughly 30

(1:47:22) wait you've never struggled with dating at all no and being a sex worker opening line is

(1:47:29) BTW I'm a prostitute back when back when I had There's no There's Oh when you had

(1:47:36) dating apps sorry I didn't mean to cut you off no you're fine you're totally fine um so you were on a dating app and would you write it in your dating app

(1:47:42) like BTW like carefully yes i don't remember exactly how I worded it because

(1:47:47) I believe it was hinged so I had to be kind of careful cuz they would try to ban me for soliciting even though that's not what I was doing i could see I could

(1:47:55) see how you Yeah but you would tell you would tell I would literally put it on my profile in abbreviated terms and say

(1:48:02) I'm super upfront about it because okay we I don't have to waste anybody else's

(1:48:07) time if that's a deal breaker for them that's completely fine and I don't judge people for that being a deal breakaker

(1:48:13) at all that's why I'm super upfront about it question for you um how many girls work at the brothel that you're at

(1:48:21) it depends i would say it's usually between maybe like five to eight on a

(1:48:27) given day on an average I would say but like maybe there's dozens in total

(1:48:32) throughout the year is that fair to say yes perhaps even more there's like a rotating schedule I would call it yeah

(1:48:39) and I mean uh of the girls that work there have are they married are they in relationships have you heard from them

(1:48:45) um I don't go out of my way to to ask everybody that I meet we're all about minding our own business and not

(1:48:51) crossing professional and personal boundaries um I am aware of several that are in

(1:48:58) happy relationships i can't tell you what gender those relationships are but

(1:49:03) not at all uncommon okay because it it would seem to me that the

(1:49:09) majority of men don't want to have romantic or sexual relationships with a

(1:49:16) active prostitute um but uh so your

(1:49:21) boyfriend like do you work is it like five days a week how how does it work um

(1:49:28) well the the place I work at Bella's Ranch is open 247 so I can take a day

(1:49:34) off or a night off whenever I please i kind of make my own schedule and But you said it was like two weeks on two weeks

(1:49:40) off yeah i'll travel up there to where it is and I will stay there for two weeks at a time sure um and work

(1:49:46) whichever days I feel like while I'm up there and then I leave and go back home

(1:49:52) okay and so go back do you live with your boyfriend yes okay okay and so you go back home after a day of working back

() 

(1:50:00) home to where you and your boyfriend live yeah after the the two weeks that I've been up there I go back home and we

(1:50:06) live together oh wait so you stay there i'm saying like he doesn't live in that region so you'll be apart from him for

(1:50:12) two weeks yes you'll stay at the location at the brothel yes is the

(1:50:17) relationship open open what do you like completely open yeah like you guys can just sleep with

(1:50:24) whoever you want he can sleep with whoever he wants i wouldn't really know what to call it um we're both very open

(1:50:31) people we're very comfortable very confident people communication trust and

(1:50:36) honesty is key in a lot of relationships but especially in one is he allowed to b another check is what I'm asking sure

(1:50:42) okay okay so it's an open Yeah that makes more sense with communication of course it's not like you can just be

(1:50:48) like I'm going to the store but it it is overtly open relationship so he'll it's

(1:50:54) ethical non- monogamy so he'll tell you like has he told you btw babe I'm gonna

(1:51:00) go Becky no i thought you said you I mean it just hasn't come up yet it's

(1:51:05) completely off the table but so I understand that he can sleep with other women has he slept with other women no

(1:51:13) but you said there's open so it's o do you sleep with other men in a nonwork capacity i don't no do

(1:51:22) you uh but that's by my choice do you sleep with him okay and you guys have a sex life I

(1:51:29) imagine okay and he's okay like does he does he need like

(1:51:35) a 24 to 48 hour window after you a guy like maybe we can pause on the kissing maybe we can wait a little bit

(1:51:42) for sex or It takes me like two days to get home so we've never really had a conversation like that before but he'll

(1:51:49) kiss Does he kiss you when you walk in the door yeah okay i do brush my teeth oh yeah we

(1:51:55) get tested every single week but do you like for example let's say you like is

(1:52:00) there a specific day of the week like Wednesday or it varies um I think it just changed recently but it's one of

(1:52:06) the earlier weekdays routinely every single like for example um every Monday morning at 9:00 a.m and that's I can't

(1:52:14) give out the exact schedule of when we actually do that but every Monday morning oops at 9:00 a.m a doctor comes

(1:52:21) and we do all of our testing there's blood testing and there's swabs sure so and you might work Tuesday Wednesday

(1:52:28) Thursday Friday yeah subsequent to the test right you'll have sex subsequent to the test and then

(1:52:35) you'll go home and then have sex with your boyfriend

(1:52:42) i overlap the testing i will usually leave on you you know before I leave I'll just do the testing again because

(1:52:49) it's just convenient let's just to be clear every week you work you ha you'll

(1:52:54) have sex then you'll take a te the STD

(1:53:00) test and that'll be the last thing you do then you leave to go home yeah I I

(1:53:05) make sure to include one in before I go which of course though even if you did do that STD uh STDs can take days weeks

(1:53:15) or even months uh to show up so even if you did the STD test uh that was you did

(1:53:21) one that was the last thing you did and then you waited for the results um that's kind of an interesting component

(1:53:28) but so he's okay your boyfriend's okay with you having sex with other men for

(1:53:35) money while in a rel and he doesn't other women he's more than welcome to he's just busy

(1:53:43) he's busy but uh

(2:01:19) sweet that's dope okay welcome all right so uh Priscilla you wanted to come back

(2:01:26) for a redemption episode uh what I guess where do we start do uh do you want to

(2:01:34) say sorry to Andrew maybe no but I do want to say I am not I do want to admit

(2:01:42) that I am ignorant of the YouTube rules and all of that and so

(2:01:50) I do feel bad about kind of pooping on the the show

(2:01:58) and so I do apologize to you Brian oh for that wow because that I'm very

(2:02:05) ignorant about the YouTube stuff i'm learning

(2:02:10) slowly so yeah there's just certain words like the

(2:02:16) platforms don't allow like oral like demonetize the

(2:02:21) video so we try to avoid saying certain words

(2:02:27) uh slurs uh there's certain topics that uh we go over before the

(2:02:34) show like hey don't bring this up so yeah

(2:02:41) um but you did kind of you know get in Andrew's face a

(2:02:49) little bit do you want to apologize for for that no I had it coming apparently did

(2:02:55) he have did Did this monster here did he have it coming

(2:03:02) that was the first time I've ever met you and it was love at first sight so why

(2:03:07) did you try to dress me down like

(2:03:14) [Music] he's a married man i'm sorry like that

(2:03:20) all happened because you came back i didn't say a word to you and then he came back and started trying to dress me down that's when I made fun of you i

(2:03:26) thought it was interesting that I presented an a thought

(2:03:33) about an argument that you made in the past and then instead

(2:03:39) of having a proper rebuttal you just attacked my character oh wait so well

(2:03:46) first of all I didn't attack your character i made fun of your voice but the thing is is that that's part of my character you came back you No that's

(2:03:52) not what happened when you came back who the hell are you to do XYZ that's not an argument i didn't say who the hell are

(2:03:59) you to do XYZ you did you said that's her culture who are you to question her cult so these You weren't making an argument you said you don't know about

() 

(2:04:05) her culture you were trying to take I think that's laughable you were trying to take a shot at me on your way out the

(2:04:10) door and so I took a shot at you back otherwise I wouldn't have engaged at all and by the way up until that point that

(2:04:15) was not about you that was Yeah that was about No you were you were getting into it

(2:04:22) you're like "And you Andrew blah blah blah blah blah." And then I made fun of you a little bit but before that it was

(2:04:27) totally respectful to you as long as you were respectful to me is that not true did I say something before that that was

(2:04:33) disrespectful i was on my way out and it's I want to say it's like the equivalent of of

(2:04:41) punching someone while they're turned around you came back to yell at me i did not

(2:04:47) come back to yell at you yes you did you were leaving and then you came you said

(2:04:53) "Brian you're a small small man." Then as you were leaving you came to take a shot at me so then I made fun of you a

(2:04:59) little bit yeah me directly not any of my ideas not my

(2:05:06) philosophy so it was warranted for you to personally attack Brian no that was

(2:05:11) rude but Brian but that is between Brian and Oh I see so the thing is is like you

(2:05:17) didn't you weren't turning around to take shots at me you were just turning around to because you wanted to make an argument on your way out the

(2:05:23) door that's very strange i guess I felt unheard and I wanted to feel heard and I

(2:05:28) wanted to get my say and I felt like I my voice was

(2:05:35) being sort of how how was I I didn't have anything to do with that i was just sitting here yeah I was literally just

(2:05:43) sitting here i didn't do anything to you then I made fun of you slightly because

(2:05:49) you decided weird you decided to you decided to dress me down yeah I don't think it was that bad no I do yeah it

(2:05:56) was it was it was get in your face and shove the chairs and I didn't shove the

(2:06:01) chair you pull up the video i move the chair not shove the chair and move the

(2:06:08) chair in my direction so that you can look at me in my eyes because I think that in order to have proper empathy you

(2:06:14) should probably look at someone in their eyes it was definitely a bit of a shove it's It's not funny it's true i I was

(2:06:21) like "Okay well if he wants to look at me in my face and and mock me like okay

(2:06:26) like at least you're looking at me not while I'm turned around going to leave." Well you were doing things which were mockworthy and no you weren't turned

(2:06:33) around to leave you were just being myself standing there yelling at me and I mocked you to your face you weren't

(2:06:39) leaving and I mocked you you forget the part where you turned to me and started

(2:06:44) started to started to lay into me and so I mocked you and then you flew around

(2:06:50) the table shoved the chair got right in my face right put your face down i did

(2:06:57) not clench your face the loss in your mind losing losing losing your mind right i was not losing my mind you were

(2:07:03) losing your mind and then I thought it was interesting how when this is like woman revisionist history i

(2:07:10) thought No you know what's funny is that if I was a man you would not be so audacious because No I you're right i

(2:07:18) would out the window right that's true i would have just thrown you right out you would have thrown No okay so let me let

(2:07:23) me No if I was a bigger man than you you would not flap your mouth like that because you know that I am less powerful

(2:07:30) than you most men That's why you're doing that do you realize that I was in I was in an ordeal kurfuffle in Miami

(2:07:37) Florida with a guy who was shocker who a guy who was massive roid raged out of

(2:07:43) his mind and he was threatening to do bodily harm to me live on a stage

(2:07:48) right next to me i didn't back down an inch i don't give a if you're a man or you're not a man no I'm not arguments

(2:07:55) argument arguments are arguments when people go crazy and try to make them physical i did not go crazy i got to

(2:08:00) vouch and just to vouch for Andrew the man in question was a large a large

(2:08:07) man bald i'm not saying that to himself but he he was blasted in tattoos and he

(2:08:15) was an exconvict and he was massive massive huge huge dude i'm not trying

(2:08:20) I'm not talking to I'm just saying and uh Andrew Andrew looked him in the face

(2:08:27) i don't even know if you looked at him you're just like whatever i'm not even scared and Andrew wasn't scared at

(2:08:33) all to be fair it was Florida and Andrew was armed with a firearm but I'm with a

(2:08:38) firearm everywhere so there is that because it's just generally speaking a good idea

(2:08:45) especially for women i don't disagree with that except usually they don't get sufficient

(2:08:52) training and so their gun gets used against them but but I don't disagree i prescriptively think that women should

(2:08:58) probably carry firearms i think it's a good idea but that aside uh I didn't run and get in your face i didn't run over

(2:09:04) to you i didn't go into your Now I want you to view it view it this way if you were sitting there and I did the same

(2:09:10) thing how would I be viewed no but I do want to say that you are

(2:09:15) stronger and there is that power oh I see so you can do whatever you want to me because I can't because I can't do

(2:09:20) harm to you but I didn't I did not touch you so I think it's weird that you framed it as a sword because you're

(2:09:26) banking on female i did not throw anything near you so you're banking on female privilege the idea is I can do

(2:09:32) whatever I want to you because the public appearance is if you did something to me right you would be you

(2:09:39) would you would be viciously attacked for hurting the poor the poor little girl who who didn't do nothing except

(2:09:45) run over and get in your face and talk about if I wanted to play victim then I wouldn't have asked you to come

(2:09:51) outside with me and to talk about it i wasn't trying to play victim no no do you understand how it sounds when

(2:09:56) somebody says "Let's go outside when they're upset." Do you think that that sounds like they want to have rational

(2:10:02) discourse or do you think that that sounds like they want to physically tangle with each other we would have talked about it and then if you felt

(2:10:09) that that that was appropriate and and that's what had then there definitely would have had to be consent on both

(2:10:15) sides it just uh it just sounded to me like um it it sounds to me like a bunch

(2:10:22) of excuse making you deserve it okay it's totally it's totally appropriate if

(2:10:27) you if the roles were reversed that wouldn't be okay but I can do it to you because you're stronger than me so therefore it's okay did I Did I hit you

(2:10:35) did I Did I Did I You definitely shove my chair yeah I shoved it or did I pull

(2:10:41) it yeah if again if I walked over here to where you are and pulled your chair

(2:10:46) and got in your face but didn't actually touch you what would the perception be that's because you're because what the

(2:10:53) argument earlier was that you are stronger than I am right so therefore you're justified where I'm not no so you

(2:11:00) are using that against me because you think that because I ran over to you no

(2:11:05) you think that I'm not going to say anything because of course that's

() 

(2:11:10) emotion is important you can't just I'm saying that's something that if

(2:11:18) if you're if you're just talking crap then whether I'm a man or a woman Yeah

(2:11:25) would it make sense that you'd be sort of antagonizing the person sort of

(2:11:31) inciting Yeah some sort of response that's what happens it's called a tit

(2:11:36) for tat that's how it works but it didn't seem tit for tat it seemed like I made a comment about a thought that you

(2:11:43) had yeah you were trying to take part you were trying to take part where I just sat there and took it you're trying

(2:11:48) to take parting shots where I sat there and took it you wanted to get your That's why you went over to the mic and were like "You're all small dick men."

(2:11:54) It's the same you're trying to get your dunks in for your parting shots and I didn't let you have your parting shot

(2:11:59) you got upset you ran over here cuz you didn't get your parting shot freaked out embarrassed yourself made yourself look

(2:12:04) bad and now your argument to me is "Well Andrew it's true if you came over and did that to me it would have looked

(2:12:11) terrible and awful but it's okay i can do it." Well because you're stronger than me so therefore I'm justified doing

(2:12:16) horrible things to you that you're not justified doing to me that's literally your argument right now just pointing

(2:12:22) that out i want to say that you what you did would be legally considered

(2:12:28) harassment especially in a workplace no it's not no it isn't way more than what

(2:12:34) you're saying me being assaulting no I guarantee you that it's it's not going to be considered harassment for me to

(2:12:40) make fun of your voice it definitely is going to be considered battery if you come over and shove my chair and get in my face i promise huh shove or pull it

(2:12:50) doesn't matter how did you Wait am I applying force to hurt or am I applying force to direct but the chair moved this

(2:12:56) way if you pulled it it would have gone towards you it was a shove is this considered a a workplace no because I

(2:13:02) know the laws on on that in addition to that nobody here you're not employees okay yeah that's that was my question so

(2:13:09) it wouldn't be considered a workplace harassment so then what are we if we're not and and just to be clear let's

(2:13:15) independent contractors just to be clear even if we were to grant that your

(2:13:20) conduct would have been deemed workplace harassment and by the way it's completely legal completely legal to

(2:13:28) make fun of people at work you can get fired that's true but it's not illegal none of that has to do with um

(2:13:34) disability nope you can make fun of people with disabilities at work sue two people for that and won a bunch of money

(2:13:40) were they above you in Station wait we Yeah and that's why it doesn't it doesn't matter yeah yes it does if if

(2:13:46) I'm at work and there's some chick there's some chick with a disability and I'm like working on a conveyor or

(2:13:52) something I can look over and make fun of her hold on i we don't need to get into like discussion okay i need to do a

(2:13:59) couple of people for anything hold on because we have people joining the panel I need to do some seating adjustments so we get everybody in frame uh you stay

(2:14:06) where you are priscilla can you can you scoot your chair that way and then I

(2:14:12) need you to scoot as far that way you guys are going to be like leg and then uh scoot your mic too please so we can

(2:14:27) yeah oh did you have something Saf she doesn't have a microphone oh oh can Wait

(2:14:32) so I need you to have good discipline tonight i'm going to I'm less nervous just can you scoot your microphone to

(2:14:38) the edge of the table and then just leave it there so if you want you can

(2:14:43) put a microphone on the table for you there should be one down there somewhere down here on the ground what number is

(2:14:50) that Andrew just typing it

(2:14:56) where are they located uh do you see how get a drink

(2:15:02) hi everybody by the way that's that would be the correct one then I think oops

(2:15:10) okay all right so then just put that right in front of you put it directly straight in front of you straight in

(2:15:16) front of you like center it it's kind of a interesting way to do a panel but uh

(2:15:23) but here we are here we are uh okay so uh guys if you

(2:15:29) want get a 100red in for a read 200 for a TTS would appreciate it guys like the

(2:15:35) video twitch.tv whatever and then uh if you want you can uh Venmo cash app

(2:15:42) whatever pod well okay so let's uh I guess skip that anyway making fun of people not a crime definitely shoving

(2:15:49) their seat or getting in their face yeah that that's arguably a crime mocking to

(2:15:55) where it incites hostility or not a crime with Yes it is look it up well why don't we just look it up do you know

() 

(2:16:00) what the First Amendment is freedom speech yeah freedom of speech it's unabbridged it means it it protects hate

(2:16:06) speech too i can go out on the street right now in front of a bunch of death people or homosexuals and be like "Hey

(2:16:12) you blah blah blah blah blah blah blah." Right i could be like "Hey you blah blah." And they can't do it's not a

(2:16:18) crime now those guys could get really pissed they could be really upset but it's not a crime i don't want to talk

(2:16:23) about that no yeah i don't I don't care about what your preference is for what you want to talk about because I want to

(2:16:29) talk about this i I would like to I would like to discuss why you think it's okay to I would like to based on based

(2:16:35) on why do you want to know why okay let me tell you why okay i think that

(2:16:41) everyone grows up differently that whole conversation precipitated from you trying to present an argument that the

(2:16:49) C-word which I actually thought was a woman's I thought that's what you guys

(2:16:54) meant of the C word because that would be my anyone's natural when you say Cword that's what you would think i did

(2:17:01) think that well hold on but maybe that's because you guys weren't paying attention because the context

(2:17:08) immediately before the C-word was brought up was related to the nword and

(2:17:14) we were talking about race so I don't know how you could I don't know why you're asking for clarification on that

(2:17:22) because if you were listening to the rest of the conversation he he referenced uh talking about the n-word

(2:17:28) and it was about race so and it's clear you knew because the words came out of

(2:17:34) your mouth you knew what the other Cword was so that's my confusion in any case

(2:17:39) we don't want you to say either of the two Cwords because the plat not because

(2:17:45) me and Andrew if this was offstream and you wanted to say any of that stuff or we're it was a different platform we

(2:17:51) didn't have an objection as it pertains to like the use of those words but we

(2:17:57) have to the platforms have rules and guidelines for monetization reasons some

(2:18:03) of them are stricter than others tik Tok's notorious for this uh it's about the platform not And you got confused

(2:18:11) there you're like "Oh why aren't we allowed to say the Cword in like a general?" No it's because of

(2:18:18) the platform yeah we don't personally care but I don't need to explain to you

(2:18:24) and in fact in the pre-show instructions we do explicitly say uh for our own

(2:18:30) guidelines and because of the platform's guidelines avoid these topics don't say

(2:18:35) these words you were on the show with Sav uh two Sundays ago or whatever and

(2:18:41) then you were on this week we went over the pre-show information don't use slurs here's a couple slurs to avoid and we

(2:18:48) say including but not limited to and so you when we were messaging in the

(2:18:54) Instagram DMs you're like "Well did you explic explicitly tell me not to say the C-word?"

(2:19:00) The problem with that is is if I were to do that the um you realize how many

(2:19:06) different slurs there are like there's there's hundreds of different slurs it would not be practical for us in a

(2:19:13) pre-show environment to like first off even if we listed every single slur not

(2:19:18) to say which would be in the hundreds if not thousands nobody would remember each

(2:19:23) individual no one would commit to memory hundreds or thousands of slurs to not say so we say "Don't say these slurs

(2:19:31) including but not limited to the uh well I'm not going to say it the R slur uh

(2:19:37) the Fbomb as you dropped it um uh the N-word those are like kind of the basic

(2:19:44) ones that could come up." But in any ways it just seemed kind of strange that

(2:19:49) you're like "Well you didn't tell me not to say it." But actually if you watch the video back origin like in the moment

(2:19:56) when you're like "What's the C word?" I was like "Don't say it." I said that i said "Don't say it." And then you said

(2:20:02) it and he did drop the furler and he knew you weren't supposed to do that and the rler after I was already told to

(2:20:09) leave which I'm sorry because that was vindictive that yeah you did it maliciously because

(2:20:14) you like "Oh now I know not to say these words let me just try to his business." No I'm very I already

(2:20:21) initiated this whole thing with the apology for that so do you forgive or not

(2:20:28) uh do I forgive you i mean I'm over it i I guess it it was a couple days ago i

(2:20:36) don't know if I forgive you for it but I'm over it like I'm not I'm not going to linger on it aside from this

(2:20:41) conversation we're having I I just was shocked and when it was coming out of my

(2:20:47) mouth it was more like me like externally realizing what what you

(2:20:55) meant like I was processing it and saying it at the same time saying what

(2:21:01) the C word i was like "Is that what you mean?" So it came out as I was thinking

(2:21:07) it i was like "What?" No no no but so if you watch the video back there was like an initial moment where you were like

(2:21:14) "Wait what is the C word what is And I was like "No no no no don't say it." Right i said it there and then of course

(2:21:19) the pre-show information were like don't say slurs and then and then you got a

(2:21:25) there was a little bit of heat going on in a couple different directions and then you're like and then you drop it

(2:21:33) and then you got the kick it was an extroverted thought it was just I was just it was an extroverted thought okay

(2:21:44) well yeah i do want to say that saying that all your viewers are tiny you

(2:21:52) they actually I did I did a poll and they all have huge penises i do want to say andrew has the biggest of them all

(2:21:59) you can send pics in it's giant it's  is this sexual harassment is this workplace harassment andrew I don't holy

(2:22:06) are you gonna send pics and I'll let her know file civil rights i already did oh james Ston is on on the case

(2:22:13) um but yeah all my It's true i In fact I even required verification so they all

(2:22:19) had to send me a photo too my viewers so I could verify i You think I'm I I can't just

(2:22:27) take their word for I got some verification so I pulled my viewers i was like "How big like is it you know?"

(2:22:33) And they told me and then they sent photos and then also I got some labia pictures too which and there is a

(2:22:38) predomination of large labia women also because I'm a large labia advocate i I'm You're not digging

(2:22:47) yourself out of that hole bro but okay uh anyways uh

(2:22:53) you're just kind of like in that one oh yeah you you were sorry do you just have like a bunch of pictures of all of their

(2:23:00) stuff do you have a dick room i I print out what what's that camera

(2:23:05) that used to print out polaroid i print out Polaroids of It's just um red string

(2:23:12) connecting it to Yes yes yeah and I categorize it by like does it slope like

(2:23:19) the slope direction and then like any Okay this is kind of weird uh wait so

(2:23:24) okay you you were going to say something about how

(2:23:30) you I don't know if it was about to be an apo a but you're saying and I also said that your viewers are teeny dick

(2:23:36) misogynist or something or whatever and what were you going to say i Yeah are you allowed to say that how

(2:23:44) about P say PP okay shrimp i like the Yeah that was very blanketed of me

(2:23:51) and you taking the poll i mean that just shows

(2:23:57) there's your proof that they have huge that they're hung

(2:24:04) it's crazy it's crazy man which Yeah it's crazy you know what

(2:24:10) else did you say like they're also misogynists right are you Oh no okay so hold on there's a couple other things to

(2:24:16) break down here as I was trying to get you to leave but you were like "No I'm going to take my time to waste your time

() 

(2:24:22) or whatever." And as you're trying to leave you're like "What you hate women

(2:24:28) to me?" Mhm um do is that what you think i'm not offended if you think that but

(2:24:34) is that what you think where were we when I said that we were standing in the hallway right there and I was like "Can

(2:24:39) you leave?" And you're like "No let me take a really long time to put my shoes on to waste more of your time." And then

(2:24:44) you're like and then you're like "You just hate women." This is going to sound

(2:24:51) like not true but I did black out for a lot of what I was saying to you after

(2:24:56) after I left you blacked out like as in like I know you're recording i think

(2:25:02) your accountability blacked out i think your accountability also blacked out i

(2:25:08) don't know i completely and totally take accountability for making fun of you when you were making parting shots totally i 100% take accountability

(2:25:17) absolutely not then absolutely not then I'm definitely not going to apologize well the the person wrong does the

(2:25:24) apology yeah both of us not the person who's not wrong i would say both of us did something wrong uh no then also

(2:25:32) where I come from and what and like I wanted to say it's about to be where I

(2:25:38) come from men men do X it's not about men or women and that's what's silly

(2:25:44) okay here we go go ahead i wish it didn't have to be men versus women but

(2:25:50) I'm just saying every single person has a different Well how can it not be when you you're like my argument for why it's

(2:25:56) perfectly acceptable to lose my mind and do and do horrible things to you is okay

(2:26:02) based on the fact that you're stronger than me i'm just pointing that out but anyway go ahead no because I after I

(2:26:08) left I saw what you said about it and you were like "Look she was looking for things to hit me with." It's like she

(2:26:14) was you were looking for things there was a bunch of things to hit you with if I was looking for things to hit you with then and I wanted to hit you then don't

(2:26:21) you think that I would have done that so I think that's total slander you know the thing is the thing the thing is is

(2:26:28) like there was there was multiple she this is what she was looking at so there was there was multiple so there's

(2:26:33) multiple women at the table who agreed with that statement three and the reason they agreed with it is because like uh

(2:26:39) I'm pretty good with understanding people's body language talked to thousands of people all over the world right and uh I you get a familiarity for

(2:26:47) what a person's kind of thinking what it is that they're they're kind of moving towards and the thing is is like it was

(2:26:53) very obvious to most of us now your rational sense may have kicked in and been like "Okay maybe doing that is one

(2:26:59) step too far." But you were definitely looking around like you were going to throw something for sure i promise you

(2:27:04) that i Well how do you know you you were blacked out how do you know i said when I was when I was just talking how do I

(2:27:10) know that you were not seconds away from blacking out here and grabbing something i mean you're just prone to blackouts

(2:27:15) when you're upset his penis what if you blacked out and sad him when when I left

(2:27:22) Rachel would have really had to come down you started saying that I was trying to find something to hit you with there's plenty of stuff to hit you with

(2:27:29) look there's glasses there there there were those little crystal things

(2:27:34) there's so many things yes I'm I'm aware that you didn't do the action that doesn't mean it didn't look

(2:27:40) as though you were going to which was my claim okay well that Well it wasn't true so I'm just letting you know yeah I

(2:27:46) don't know about that i'm not convinced okay yeah i remain unconvinced

(2:27:52) unconvinced yeah i think that uh I think that if you could have in the moment gotten away with throwing something at

(2:27:58) my head you definitely would have there's plenty of stuff to throw at your

(2:28:03) head yes but you not doing it doesn't mean that if you thought you could have gotten away with it you wouldn't have nor that you weren't looking for

(2:28:09) something and then just thought better of it i wasn't well I don't know who knows cuz you blacked out after you left

(2:28:15) you know you don't even remember you don't remember what you said you don't remember your version of events aren't

(2:28:21) so clear cuz you weren't conscious for some of them you know like maybe maybe the part maybe the part

(2:28:29) where you were looking for things to throw at me you just missed because in that moment you blacked out for just a

(2:28:34) few seconds i didn't look how would you know if you blacked out well first of all it was all being filmed so I think

(2:28:39) we would know if I picked something up to We should watch the film because it definitely Can we sure we can pull it up

(2:28:47) yeah it definitely looked We can pull it up you'll see you'll see okay just want to say what I was about to say so that

(2:28:52) you don't think it's men versus women i was going to say each individual person has their own in path and how they were

(2:29:00) brought up and each circumstance is different and that whole conversation precipitated by you were about to

(2:29:07) present an argument of which is worse the cword or the n-word i wanted to say

(2:29:13) even presenting that argument contributes to systemic o the systemic

(2:29:18) oppression of of black people in the US and you about to drop the n-word right there no I thought you were about to

(2:29:24) systemic oppression of Yeah it seemed she was about but anyway so but I also

(2:29:31) want to say that my mom was affiliated to to uh Crips which is a a

(2:29:38) predominantly black gang mhm and and how and I want to say deep in my sub I don't

(2:29:45) think it's correct that did they jump her in I I don't know I just want to say deep deep in my subconscious it's like

() 

(2:29:52) the whole thing is if you want to talk if you want to talk poop then then

(2:29:57) you're going to it's like you know what I mean like don't just go around and I feel

(2:30:03) like as the and I want to say so your mom taught you no I want to say to violently assault people what did your

(2:30:10) mom teach you to mock people for the It's insane i I Okay I You know what you

(2:30:16) know what what's happening it's so funny to watch this in real time so here's what's happening here so you take a a

(2:30:21) woman right she's small she's unassuming she seems like it's not a big problem this or that then you take a minor

(2:30:27) squabble where the woman goes crazy does a bunch of hang on does a bunch of which clearly is insane

(2:30:34) right loses her mind to the point where they black out come back the next day and then gaslight you literally gaslight

(2:30:40) you listen this is like so many relationship stories like this listen baby it wasn't really that bad it wasn't

(2:30:47) what you think you're misremembering things honestly I'm just a dainty little little thing you You can trust me i just

(2:30:54) did and then the difference though here we have the It's like impossible

(2:31:00) to gaslight me because I've watched it 30 times you were an I rate lunatic pull it up you were Look look at yourself i

(2:31:08) rate lunatic i don't think it's an apology or accountability if you like make excuses for it like putting in like

(2:31:15) we do not apologize to him and take no accountability exactly don't apologize to Andrew i don't apologize to Andrew i

(2:31:21) apologize to Brian for what for violating the contract in your rules i

(2:31:27) would never have filled out and and also for for making little jabs on my way out

(2:31:33) okay the jab and what about the interrupting not following the rules and for not um following the proper

(2:31:38) structure the flow but I I want to say you guys want to arm wrestle or something like Wait no that's Let's not

(2:32:35) gang that is misrepresentation and I felt that you just being I felt like you

(2:32:42) were improperly using this is a this is a power dynamic is it not like this is an power dynamic i'm just a

(2:32:50) guest you're not a guest you're like a co would he be like your co-host andrew is actually my dentured servant i have a

(2:32:59) contract from his great great great greatgrandfather enslaving him to me and

(2:33:06) he's this is slave labor here and so Andrew um least amount of power then

(2:33:12) yeah he's like yeah he like cleans the bathroom after the show and like cleans up all the the women leave their their

(2:33:21) nails their fake nails everywhere disgusting he cleans it up there's hair on the floor and sometimes I the

(2:33:29) amount of the bathroom's all up after the show i blame it on the women totally up whoa and uh Yeah so

(2:33:38) he's in he's in there after the show like uh what's that what's that girl uh

(2:33:43) with the red hair from like the 20s in that movie this is some burrito revisionism right here what is that wait

(2:33:51) no i'm telling you i'm talking about like I love this he's like Annie he's like Annie there like it's a hard knock

(2:33:58) life for us it's a hard knock life for us and he's just in the bathroom

(2:34:04) cleaning it's crazy i don't even give him a Swiffer i'm like use a I have a toothbrush in there that he has to use

(2:34:10) and that's how he cleans the bathroom like some military you need to get him the Annie wig now and make him wear

(2:34:15) that so power dynamics like it's crazy like you guys coming in like you Yeah i

(2:34:22) have to see see all this alcohol he's drinking for him to tolerate doing this job he needs to be tanked out of his

(2:34:29) mind because it's just brutal so okay I get that okay I'll shut up okay neither

(2:34:36) of us are are I feel like we both You're right i was taking sort of little jabs

(2:34:43) and I feel like but I hadn't taken any of you right and I and and I'm sorry for

(2:34:48) that yeah i just want I just want the record to show that you actually provoked me so the the argument in

(2:34:54) defense for your uh whatever these weird simp goons have been making on your

(2:34:59) behalf which is you provoked her no the opposite's true you provoked me and all I did was barely make fun of you it was

() 

(2:35:06) like a little All I did was mock by it well it's not only minimized but listen

(2:35:12) that is like the lowest tier form of mockery just kind of making fun of somebody right when they when they're

(2:35:18) acting hysterical and you kind of mock their voice it's the lowest tier it should not take you from zero hysterical

(2:35:26) yes hysterical happened after you started antagonizing me oh I see no accountability again so words can So I

(2:35:33) can control you with words it's like I did a jab and then So I can control you with words and then you punched me and

(2:35:39) and you know it's like I punched you no I did a jab mhm sorry keep going i was

(2:35:45) just I was interacting with the chat but Rachel wants to call in so that's that's

(2:35:51) the wife and I feel like you she needs to talk to you like woman to woman lady

(2:35:57) to lady oh your wife mhm oh oh

(2:36:03) that's real accountability right there if you do it don't point at me oh I'm sorry i didn't mean to yo she might Dude

(2:36:09) she might freak out you're gonna Jen I Your chair is going to have trouble soon

(2:36:14) just to to paint me in a light that I was going crazy when when I told you to

(2:36:19) look at me in my face no you didn't tell me to invoke just a shred of empathy from you

(2:36:25) you don't get Listen you don't get to force me to empathize with you do you like Do you understand how absurd that

(2:36:31) sounds do you understand how absurd it sounds to say you need to have empathy

(2:36:38) it's a It's like paradoxical to say I did a jab and then and then and then you

(2:36:43) went below the belt i mocked you and then I mocked you i did a jab you went below the belt yeah I mocked you and you made it a personal thing because instead

(2:36:51) of actually having a proper rebuttal to what there was no rebuttal to have sensitivity we're supposed to have a

(2:36:57) debate while you're walking out of the room okay you're right you're right it's a parting shot so you made a parting

(2:37:02) shot i made a parting shot the difference is I didn't go haywire and ballistic have self-control didn't lose my mind when you came over here right

(2:37:10) started screaming i actually right to decelerate you from going to the next

(2:37:15) level of Looney Tunes Land walked away even though I was totally justified in provoking you further oh and then I just

(2:37:22) want Oh how I don't want to say pathetic i just want to say after I left and you're like

(2:37:29) why didn't any of you come to my defense true oh fof off you know floof see what a lot of

(2:37:37) empathy you want from me not a lot of empathy from you no because you're not understanding how you are antagonistic

(2:37:43) yeah the whole world doesn't revolve around your version of empathy and the whole world doesn't revolve

(2:37:49) around your feelings the whole world revolves around facts and evidence of what really happened here's what really happened you obnoxiously turned around

(2:37:56) and you obnoxiously turned around flubbing up you obnoxiously turned around talked a bunch of and so And

(2:38:03) so I mocked you and you lost your  mind that's objectively what happened so you did it twice so what so

(2:38:09) am I So is it okay that I say you're crazy right now you're just unhinged because you keep on going against the

(2:38:15) rules what rules you just keep on cursing cursing is not against the rules you can say You can say those you're

(2:38:21) allowed to say You can't say certain slurs you can say you can say

(2:38:27) you can say things like that what yeah well so obviously I don't other word

(2:38:33) all right I do agree that I didn't break no rules what that I don't like people making fun

(2:38:39) of my voice so I agree that that and saying that you are either

(2:38:47) physically or mentally um have something wrong with you yeah that's exactly right

(2:38:53) look at Jess Gerald he's so basically she's saying I'm sorry you made me do that that's That's your accountab I'm

(2:38:59) sorry that you accountability too so I did a jab so that you could have me

(2:39:05) person it's really not ableist i have a lisp and then you totally undercut my

(2:39:10) the perception that's funny because I didn't make fun of you with a lisping voice i know I mocked I mocked your what

(2:39:16) I did was I mocked you using a childlike voice you said she sounded like she was deaf and you were making Yes I was

(2:39:23) making fun of her voice but I wasn't making fun of trying to make you look better and then you're painting me as a crazy person is she deaf clearly not is

(2:39:30) it still the same clearly clearly not even though Okay do you know after that happened people were actually If it's

(2:39:37) not harassment and it's not inciting violence then why were people coming to my page and telling me that I better be

(2:39:44) careful cuz who oh they're threatening you this is my fault how

() 

(2:39:51) do you think that I called i thought I got a bunch of death awareness that was Do you think that I called each of these

(2:39:56) people and told them to go to your page and harass you you have a responsibility to sort of Do you not oh my god i have

(2:40:05) literally a million fans what responsibility do I have to a

(2:40:10) million people so he doesn't care about the messages that he's sending you guys i guess he has no

(2:40:17) responsibility towards actually um giving you correct information he's just trying to incite contempt for women i

(2:40:25) see so because what if we all had a good time do things what if on this show everyone had a good time that would show

(2:40:32) that men on this show do have a good time often well that's true such a

(2:40:38) misogynist Andrew i just But that is your So I had actually the exact just so you know I had the exact opposite

(2:40:44) argument i said I take full accountability for the fact that I mocked you and I just gave you an account for the tip for tat for why I

(2:40:49) did the distinction here is that your argument is Andrew you made me do it you

(2:40:54) made me do it that's exactly what you did you just said tit for tat no no no you didn't make me do the tit for tat

(2:40:59) but what you're saying is that I provoked you to the point where you just had to lose your mind come over here get in my face totally my fault my

(2:41:06) mind watch and to say that I if I would have I don't know why Brian won't pull

(2:41:12) up this video he's saying if I wanted to hit you then I would have hit you uhhuh

(2:41:18) wait Rachel we tried calling on Discord no if I wanted to hit you I would have tried to stop Andrew's Discord no can

(2:41:24) you lo and also I would have gotten your consent if I wanted to do that consent yeah because there is mutual combat laws

(2:41:31) in California we could Oh I don't know that no I don't why don't we just Google

(2:41:36) it i think in Seattle you can do that no that's here too you can have Washington you can like Washington wait

(2:41:43) Oregon i think I don't think there's mutual I think so in California yeah somebody just has to ask me if they can

(2:41:49) hit me and then I say yeah and then they well like you could for example if you were like at a bar district or whatever

(2:41:54) and you're in Seattle or Washington or whatever and there's a cop you can be like hey me and that guy we want to do

(2:42:00) mutual combat and they're not going to like arrest you now like once the guy's knocked out and you if you start beating

(2:42:06) him and he's knocked out then they'll intervene but they'll let you like you can fight in front of the cops and

(2:42:11) they'll let you do it okay that makes sense to a point to a point yeah like if they're knocked out on the ground then

(2:42:18) it's over but um Okay uh Rachel we're I tried to call you on through Andrew's

(2:42:23) Discord i don't know if you there's a different way rachel can you maybe She's pretty rough uh

(2:42:30) Rachel can you message me on Instagram she's way better than me uh yellow shirt

(2:42:36) needs anger management okay she did black out during that moment yeah she blacked out better be careful uh uh oh

(2:42:43) um you are the definition of abusive and narc you hit a man he's gonna let Oh if you hit a man he's gonna lay you out see

(2:42:50) that is also Oh these are below the threshold that is also That's weird i

(2:42:56) feel like I said if I was a bigger man you would if I was a bigger If I was a

(2:43:01) big man you have a penis if I was a man and I was bigger than him I'm sorry he would not have done the same thing so

(2:43:09) that is used so I'm also using your same logic prove it so who was the aggressor with the tattoo

(2:43:15) guy at at that case i mocked him incessantly constantly i was You were

(2:43:21) the aggressor i don't so you have a history do you mean the provoker i would say Yeah i would say that I definitely

(2:43:28) blood yeah i disputed his worldview first yeah disputed his world view

(2:43:33) andrew I don't think that's provocation to like threats of physical violence you were super respectful until he became

(2:43:40) disrespectful much like this he was the But Wes Wson was the provoker sure okay you disagreed with them you disagree you

(2:43:46) were perfectly respectful you disagreed with him like I am with everybody until they go crazy he threatened you with

(2:43:52) Stop calling me crazy then well I'm sorry but you I could call you a lot of things you act like a If we're allowed

(2:43:57) to cuss let's not get into like a screaming match insulting back and forth wait

() 

(2:44:03) Priscilla can I have you scoot your mic that way just a tad and just keep it No you can i mean you can hit me with it tell me what you think about me okay

(2:44:08) before Before you guys do that uh we have a chat oh can you unmute over on the keyboard just hit the mute button at

(2:44:14) the very top of the keyboard it's on the keyboard on the keyboard very top in confronting Andrew brian was justified

(2:44:21) in the kick two wrongs don't make a right but three lefts make a right

(2:44:26) little laugh love glad you came back uh Priscilla fan the beginning part was just what Priscilla did was justified in

(2:44:33) confronting Andrew sorry our audio was muted um there you go you have a fan Priscilla

(2:44:38) the thing is though is uh she was I think if it happened in

(2:44:45) reverse I'd be in jail right now that's all I'm going to say well I would literally be in jail oh yeah you would

(2:44:51) be But but I also feel that way that you would be in jail what yeah it just Do

(2:44:56) you know Do you know that the Santa Barbara Police Department contacted me and I told them not to press charges

(2:45:02) really they contacted you yes that sounds true and they contacted him

(2:45:07) that sounds very truthful they they they contacted both of us they did so they're

(2:45:13) just big fans of the whatever show probably somebody called them somebody called somebody called and I got a call

(2:45:18) from uh I mean I have the voicemail but I mean I'm not going to play it did someone call the police then probably

(2:45:25) somebody Yeah somebody called the police and reported i think you told them to i'm just saying that if the reverse had

(2:45:31) happened you did you said someone called They wouldn't be calling you i don't think you really be in this building my

(2:45:36) ass would be getting kicked all the way out to the squad car and I'd be in  prison right this second that's

(2:45:42) what would have happened and so it's really funny to me that you think you can put me in a compromising position

(2:45:48) because well Andrew you're bigger so therefore it's justified that's really what your argument reduces to yes it is

(2:45:54) yes it is cuz if the same thing happened in reverse I'd be in jail we all know I'd be in jail they all know I'd be in

() 

(2:46:01) jail everyone here knows I'd be in jail including you i'd be in jail and so the thing is is like it's a total

(2:46:07) double standard cuz they mocked your place it's like I'm wondering if it depends on the size of the man if he

(2:46:14) would be in jail or not no who cares like why would that matter

(2:46:21) if they're really really big you're still not justified in doing horrible things to them because it makes you feel

(2:46:26) good like do you get that it doesn't matter if they're seven feet tall you still can't go get in their face and if

(2:46:33) they do that to you they go to prison that's where they go they go to jail i'd be in jail and they would have

(2:46:39) kicked my ass on the way out by the way they would have and probably justifiably so right they would have kicked my ass

(2:46:45) here they would have cuffed my ass they would have thrown my ass in a squad car my ass would be in a jail cell right

(2:46:51) this second guarantee it everybody here knows it there's nobody's confused about it the only person that's confused about

(2:46:58) it you i would never put you in that compromising position or myself but you

(2:47:03) felt justified because I'm a man because you hate men no you felt hate men you're

(2:47:10) just painting me as someone that I'm not you're like a crazy person total monster like you did a monstrous thing take no

(2:47:16) accountability now you're coming back in trying to gaslight people and pretend you're the good guy this seems like projection yeah it's projection pretend

(2:47:24) you're the good guy even though I'd be in jail if I did the exact same thing you can just wave the behavior away it's

(2:47:29) like maybe I should have pressed charges i don't know maybe maybe that would have been the best thing to do but I didn't

(2:47:35) because it was all on camera that's why you didn't and it's pretty clear what the actual law is you know what in the

(2:47:41) future this is the third time this has happened where a woman has assaulted me and for you painting it as an assault

(2:47:48) next time I think in the future I am actually going to follow through with the charge pressing cuz they just don't

(2:47:53) give it i did not touch you like they'll acknowledge that they did this thing that you would be in jail if you did the

(2:47:59) thing but they still don't care they're just like whatever how about I forgive you and we're fine no forgiveness

(2:48:06) requires accountability that's how forgiveness works you don't go to someone and say

(2:48:11) "Hey I'd like you to forgive me for this thing that I didn't do to you." I think we both um got upset and I I wasn't

(2:48:19) upset i'm still not upset so that's just how you act yes that's how he does this

(2:48:24) he tries to Yeah if you're if you're if you're a dick I'm a dick and if you're cool I'm cool the I had a respectful

(2:48:31) debate with both of these gals and they're here they were totally cool she DM'd me beforehand and was like "Hey I

(2:48:36) don't want to get into like some personal flame war and I said "Yeah me either i'd rather do deal with the ideas." It was fantastic that's what I

(2:48:42) wanted you're the common denominator ideas but you're right i did make a jab on the way out but you painting me as

(2:48:47) someone as I'm not is not okay because I love with capitals i love men i love men you

(2:48:55) love to put them in compromised position where they can go to jail no I don't i think it's funny because the reverse is that you wouldn't have done that if I

(2:49:02) was a bigger man so you're right you see how this is right here if I had just stood up in the wrong way i had to

(2:49:08) actually stand up in a specific way i had to make sure that I moved the proper

(2:49:14) way to stand up to get away from you because I was afraid if I stood up too quick and it just bulled you over just

(2:49:20) me standing up I'd be in jail so you can actually see in the in the video me shifting slightly to get out of the

(2:49:27) chair i'm shifting my body weight this way away from you i stand up super slowly and away just so that the very

(2:49:33) appearance of like oh my arm brushed against her right uh wasn't there so I

(2:49:39) didn't end up in jail you're assuming that I'm the type of person that would that would do something like that and

(2:49:46) that would and would make you person who blacks out you just went to my You just went to my face and said "You hate men

(2:49:54) you hate men." Well I can't I the The only thing that I can draw the only conclusion I can draw with your double

(2:49:59) standard is that you hold the There is no double standard there's a difference of There's It's We're different we're

() 

(2:50:06) different yes and you think that difference enables you to to get in men's faces and assault them and I don't

(2:50:12) think so no you think that you could run your mouth because you know that I'm not physically strong why do you think if you're a man I wouldn't run my mouth run

(2:50:19) my mouth to men all the time and you know what most of the time have you had your most the time they laugh and the

(2:50:24) other thing is is that men men they don't do the that you did they don't go like they don't make little

(2:50:30) passive aggressive jabs and they debate they get in there they debate yeah then they if they don't do that

(2:50:35) then why did you make a little passive aggressive jab at me cuz you no you made the passive you made the passive

(2:50:42) aggressive jab aggressive aggressive jab it was aggressive Aggressive not passive

(2:50:49) so I'm going to let you pick Priscilla you're talking about pressing charges wait Priscilla don't It's okay no no I

(2:50:57) said I should have i'm not going to but I should have he's not priscilla I have two presents for you really don't play

(2:51:05) with me you get to pick you get to unwrap one well both of the presents but you get to pick the order i have Rachel

(2:51:13) Andrew's wife on the Discord is that a present in some way it will be and then

(2:51:18) two uh we can So it's either Rachel and then the video like us reacting to the video

(2:51:24) or video and then uh these are not presents i feel like it's a present can

(2:51:30) I know why I'm talking to your wife who I've never met in my life because I feel like getting a woman's Because that what

(2:51:36) you do what you do to me affects her too don't you think there's a conflict of interest here i'm sorry didn't you just say I'm a big evil scary man and that if

(2:51:44) I was a woman the other there would be other results it's like well now you have the perfect opportunity not one

(2:51:49) time did I call you big Andrew she has to stick up for her man you know well then well well then even that then how

(2:51:56) how could you be intimidated then what do you mean wait Rachel are you uh we tried calling but I don't know if you

(2:52:01) were all ready let me uh is she uh on the call over there can you see her or no okay we'll just we'll just wait a

(2:52:08) little bit uh here let me just read this chat here while we uh Ken says "Or you know what let's have Sav read it." Sav

(2:52:15) can you read this one oh god oh wait no don't watch it back lady you should I'll read it she does sound like a death bed

() 

(2:52:22) he mocked you because you deserve to be mocked watch it back lady you should apologize to Andrew i think we should

(2:52:29) take this time to give my son Maverick a shout out uh not the women please oh

(2:52:36) well I wonder why you don't want the women to speak that's weird okay and definitely not misogynistic podcast he's

(2:52:42) the best guest there is maga did you vote for Trump

(2:52:49) i think that they're Am I allowed to say I think that Kanye i mean what what do you mean i think that they're all PDF

(2:52:56) files so that's what I think uh we're not going to get into that and good job

(2:53:02) for using the the change wait do you want to do a shout out for Maverick really quick Andrew uh well was it his

(2:53:10) birthday or something he says "Uh we should give this time to give my son Maverick a I mean well shout out shout

(2:53:15) out to your son Kenneth Maverick." Shout out to you Maverick are you going to do a Sill thing too or I don't I don't know

(2:53:23) i don't know just trying to stay on theme here wait I have a question the theme is Adam Nazi well you're okay with

(2:53:30) uh that's what they call this slur for disabled people so that's that makes you a a snaz i mean if you're okay with Can

(2:53:38) I say something making fun of people is nowish can I feel like the Nazis were

(2:53:43) pretty respectful ultimately they did horrible things but they were respectful about it i really do want to try to

(2:53:49) bridge the gap here that's nice bridge the gap with my wife he He's going for a smoke he's coming

(2:53:55) back he's coming back he's going out for a quick also like to go for that too since we're both equal guests well I

(2:54:02) can't have you but he is the slave boy with Yeah we I can't have you guys

(2:54:08) out there on the same at the same moment why do you feel like like tempted to do

(2:54:14) something it's awkward not to share the bathroom okay okay so um I'm not going

(2:54:21) to talk to this man's wife if he does if he he he doesn't even want to be next to me why would I talk to I don't think he

(2:54:29) even wants to be next to me i don't think he wants to be next to me either to be fair priscilla my question for you

(2:54:34) is like you're a stand-up comedian right yes and it's like don't you get heckled like so why I

(2:54:43) mean aren't you kind of used to people saying you know no one has ever said anything like that nobody's heckled

(2:54:49) you not like No I guess not really i But it does happen open mic

(2:54:56) standup or do you do booked gigs i'll do both all the Yeah both do they Is there

(2:55:01) heckling at open mics i don't I prefer heckling because I'm like well if

(2:55:07) you I normally it just doesn't happen because they have a structured set for them i get it right but I feel like what

(2:55:16) Andrew was doing was in effect heckling you know the only thing he's right that

(2:55:22) I was but to paint me in a light that I'm just some crazy lady like and he does and he's invalidating his actions

(2:55:30) and then minimizing them i don't think that's very fair true thank you that's

(2:55:35) true this is just what he does do we have Rachel and I hold on can you uh try to like hit

(2:55:42) the call button on the thing wait here let me Wait this is even a bit antagonistic especially her calling me

(2:55:49) improper wait so uh like let me judge her let's know a little bit about her

(2:55:55) we're waiting rachel are you uh are you ready Rachel or We tried calling i don't

(2:56:01) know what happened rachel is the Discord calling so

(2:56:09) um you waterboard people oh god she waterboards people bro oh I

(2:56:18) need Can you demonstrate on Priscilla oh my gosh yeah that's the gave you you

(2:56:25) won't do it or Oh she's got pay you don't do freebies can you give her waterboard waver can you Can you give

(2:56:32) her a waterboard freebie i know you do that for work savannah will you do a waterboard freebie

(2:56:39) uh will you waterboard Priscilla why do I think that's probably it you can't do that on YouTube i don't think you can w

(2:56:46) You know what i've seen I saw Christopher Hitchens get waterboarded on YouTube

(2:56:52) for educational purposes I think you can do it but it probably the video probably

(2:56:57) gets age restricted if you're doing torture techniques so wait what about

(2:57:03) waterboarding did you have another question how how many different people have you done it

(2:57:09) to um I would say a fair handful a fair

(2:57:14) handful can I ask what the cost of water boarding is oh yeah i I can't give out

(2:57:19) exact exact numbers um but it it depends there's a lot of talking that happens beforehand there's waiverss that get

(2:57:26) signed and they get boundaries they get like sexual gratification from it or they

(2:57:33) just like they just feel brave um but yeah I mean sometimes okay they do

(2:57:39) it kind of depends but Huh interesting kind of a weird niche i don't even know how you do that i don't I I once had a

(2:57:46) dude DM me asking for me to put on heels and um stomp on his ball so didn't do it

(2:57:54) but um that's crazy yeah he only wanted to give me like 250 he offered a couple

(2:57:59) grand maybe no I'm joking i could not do that i couldn't what really and then I

(2:58:05) found out he was in like all of my friends in boxes it was just his thing I guess wow wow do we have her i think we

(2:58:14) have her but I just Okay here i'll come back and fix it so

(2:58:23) uh I'm gonna go okay you guys for like a minute you guys

(2:58:30) look into this camera and wink or something um

(2:58:36) So um what I winked I winked it like four

(2:58:42) times she did it was really cute

(2:59:20) Priscilla that if she comes anywhere near my husband she's going to have to deal with me i'll fly out there and she

(2:59:26) could try getting in my face and see how tough she feels then because I guarantee if it was me sitting across from your

(2:59:32) ass you would not have had that kind of energy whatsoever that is and

(2:59:37) for you to think that you can physically attack my husband like get in his face say you want to take him outside on a

(2:59:43) national TV show that everyone saw and then come back in the studio and act like you didn't do nothing like well he

(2:59:50) made fun of me too bad are you a child or are you a grown woman have some

(2:59:55) self-control and if you can't have some self-control I'll come over there and teach you some how about that

(3:00:02) well Rachel it sounds like you're a little unhinged are you okay you're the one that's unhinged there sweet cheeks

(3:00:08) i'm not the lunatic who tried to attack a grown man on a live podcast what the

(3:00:14) hell was thinking i'm wondering are you threatening me on a live podcast you're saying you're going to fly down

(3:00:21) here you're going to teach me a lesson yeah she just says stern talking to a stern talk that's exactly what I wanted

(3:00:27) to do when I said I wanted to go outside with Andrew i just wanted to give him a stern talking to sweet cheeks you ain't

(3:00:34) going nowhere with him and what I'll do is I'll come and get in between you and him so that you can deal with someone

(3:00:40) your own size what do you think about that now are you going to calm down and apologize you are the one who is

(3:00:46) unhinged and the whole world sees it the whole world knows it you sound like a delight first of all the life crying

(3:00:55) your tears you're completely full of  i'm not crying

(3:01:01) you're crazy you have no business doing comedy you're not funny don't do any more you're not funny go get a job at a

(3:01:08) Oh gosh Rachel okay because that's that's what you should be doing you should be like ringing up groceries

(3:01:14) you're never going to be a comedian you're never going to be a podcaster do you look down on minimum wage workers

(3:01:19) rachel I'm making fun of you because you deserve it because you're a laughingstock you're absurd and you're

(3:01:26) ridiculous absurd is true yeah you're not funny you're not entertaining nobody cares about your

(3:01:33) little Saab story nobody cares that your mama was in a gang like what the hell dude like what the hell what's wrong

(3:01:38) with you do you not hear yourself do you have no self-awareness just stop right back at you Rachel i acted like a

(3:01:45) lunatic i physically threatened a man a grown man i physically threatened him in front of the whole world i was wrong

(3:01:52) that was stupid even if I was upset I should have controlled myself that's the correct answer and if your mother didn't

(3:01:58) teach you correctly I'm here to correct your behavior now stop your

(3:02:04) uh is your wife reprimanding me right now i think yes that's what I'm doing

(3:02:09) you made I made it funny how to behave you need your mom you need a mama to

(3:02:15) come in here and tell you what appropriate behavior looks like so that's what I'm doing you're welcome

(3:02:27) of him or I'll be the one calling the Santa Barbara police you got it first of all I didn't lay a hand on your

(3:02:33) husband painting it as assault was insane and I did not make a threat i asked him

(3:02:40) if he wanted to go out and talk you want to step outside what does that sound like cash me outside catch me outside

(3:02:46) how about that what difference does it make what oh it makes a big difference it makes a big difference police are

(3:02:53) calling us asking if we'd like to press charges it makes a difference i don't think that's true okay you want to hear

(3:02:59) Do you Brian can play the message sure

(3:06:55) I don't feel bad all right and painting yourself as the victim is pathetic so let's see it painting

() 

(3:07:01) yourself as the victim is what's pathetic it makes you sick that's what's pathetic

(3:07:07) i have a right to do whatever I want to you because you're bigger than me that's your do anything to you making you look

(3:07:14) into my eyes and pulling your chair does not constitute assault yeah making you

(3:07:20) do a thing so that you could be and the only reason and but I just want to say paradoxical how what if we just had like

(3:07:28) normal rapport like having normal rapport with you I know but what if instead of your your wife basically

(3:07:35) threatening me she never threatened you I didn't think you were not there when she said I'll come down and show you and

(3:07:41) teach you and yeah so she's mothering you yeah so then so so she's threatening

(3:07:48) to have a conversation with you with that's what I was threatening to do did Rachel say step outside basically that's

(3:07:54) what it meant i'm going to come down there and teach you a lesson h I think that's in a similar spirit it was as

(3:08:01) beating you in a debate that's a lesson she beating me in a debate you personally attacked me no her as a

(3:08:07) rebuttal her that's how she That's how she does things she beats people in debates

() 

(3:08:14) i'm disappointed in you i don't care i don't it was a There's nothing more disappointing than a gas lighter that

(3:08:21) would be you i'm not You minimizing it at the beginning is a gas lighter to minimize gas who got in whose face did I

(3:08:27) get in your face and then calling me crazy and then acting like it wasn't valid who got in whose face as I should

(3:08:32) who got in you should have see what I mean it's like what do you do with that this was you Priscilla

(3:08:38) that was you bro hold on let me This was you oh Andrew talk get hit talk

(3:08:45) get hit look come here how's it Andrew wait do the fingers do the fingers of the baby

(3:17:42) were definitely screaming we have the We have the cell phone of that too you were no I wasn't oh man just like you weren't

(3:17:47) screaming when you put your head this close to me and started screaming that was not screaming yes it was no it wasn't yes that's why they heard you

(3:17:53) through the mic yes and what happened is you started by not screaming and then when you got close you started screaming

(3:17:59) the voice went up a little bit when you started yeah cuz you were screaming that's what happens your voice goes up that's how that works that was not a

(3:18:06) scream and like a banshee yeah like a Well you did sound like a banshee yes i don't think so especially when you like

(3:18:12) went up right up to the mic and then started cussing at the audience it just you know wasn't I did say that was a

(3:18:17) blanket at You remember how you pulled my chair you didn't push it i swiveled it remember how I was screaming like a

(3:18:22) banshee you shrived it or you I'm sorry you swiveled it by pushing it like literally trying to push it out from

(3:18:28) under me not to push it out in See you see that's not honest except we can we

(3:18:33) literally just watched it yeah to look at me i swiveled it to for you to look at me not to push it out from under you

(3:18:40) without grabbing it and you shove it how's that a swivel it was a push it was a push you're right it was more of a push but it wasn't It wasn't to push you

(3:18:47) off definitely wasn't a pull definitely not a pull it was like a swivel no it was more like a shove definitely a shove

(3:18:54) it's a different sort of force it definitely is yeah the it is different than a pull because it's the opposite

(3:18:59) motion yes I agree with that i I'm gonna find someone who knows more about physics than I do but I'm I'm just

(3:19:06) saying I didn't shove you out physics thing i wasn't going to shove you consult with perhaps a PhD mhm i feel

(3:19:14) like it's a master i don't feel like it's a physics thing i feel like if your hand goes like that it's a push and if

(3:19:20) your hand goes like that it's a pull what I wanted to say like 10 minutes ago I don't have a source what I wanted to

(3:19:25) say like 10 minutes ago what I wanted to say a long time ago I'm afraid I can't help you okay totally fair reasonable i

(3:19:34) think that it's far crazier to attack someone's character to attack their

(3:19:39) dreams like your wife did i can understand where her rage is coming from because I'm sure I would feel a lot of

(3:19:45) protection towards my person as well so I get that but to on someone's

(3:19:52) dreams that seems crazy to me if we're going to talk about you should you

(3:27:55) gets confused yes it does okay okay i call that being frazzled

(3:28:03) there's a lot of frazzling with you i do get it lot lot of frazzlement my brain doesn't always bring that correctly your

(3:28:09) brain isn't braining so did a bunch of dudes slide into your teeth oh yeah there's a lot of them thank you guys by

(3:28:49) once I looked like the statue outside of her church so I just I didn't have the heart to say anything but thank you and

(3:28:54) walk away yo wait chat does she not look like she would be in a Renaissance

(3:29:02) painting like you have that look to you you have the nun look now you got to figure out if that's a compliment it's a

(3:29:08) compliment it's a compliment uh an in either or okay you just have a

(3:29:14) very sweet angelic look in the face so moving on jen you said Andrew also trust

(3:29:22) these demons yeah you don't trust y'all kind of went a little hard on me cuz y'all were mad about all of this

(3:29:29) situation i don't feel like anymore you The first thing you did was start laughing at me like I said something

() 

(3:29:35) crazy about Did you say something wanting a family farm you said I was a communist because I want to own land

(3:29:40) with like my No because you were mixing up okay no I was I wasn't laughing

(3:29:45) because legit why you started laughing you called me communist i wanted No that's not why let's like do you want to

(3:29:52) be honest about it or Yeah sure okay so we can be honest about it so what happened is you said you want a farm to

(3:29:58) move away from capitalism and you're a libertarian i I'm just talking about because the way

(3:30:04) the government is right now and we can't nobody can afford to live in this communist situation i'd rather get out

(3:30:11) of that yeah I know but all I was doing was laughing because you were using

(3:30:16) terms which were contradictory to each other and I would try to explain to you and I would try to explain to you why

(3:30:22) you can you can be a libertarian and be adverse to capitalism how how I'm averse to the way the our government is like

(3:30:31) going about right now yeah I get I get that but that could mean anything you know what I that's why I'm saying you

(3:30:36) can't use these contradictory terms is all I was saying that's what I was laughing at i mean you can but that's

(3:30:41) going to make guys like me laugh because they're contradictions when you contradict yourself I laugh that's

(3:30:47) That's how I like I can't help myself i mean no you you I'm not It's like you say it's like when you say "I can fly

(3:30:53) like Superman." And then and then you go "But you know nobody can nobody can fly like Superman." And then of course I'm

(3:30:59) going to laugh it's like what it's absurd i can want a small government and and lack of zoning all of that and not

(3:31:08) want to depend on a government where no one can afford groceries and everyone has to Yeah that's all consistent that

(3:31:15) so but that wasn't what you were saying so that's is what I was saying no it wasn't what you were saying okay just

(3:31:22) saying yeah that's not actually what what you indeed did say so all I can do

(3:31:27) like I can't and people have a problem with it's not just women there's just people have an issue really literally

(3:31:34) they have an issue yeah but the thing is they have an issue with the idea that I can live in their brain that I can go in

(3:31:40) their brain and explore i can be like "Oh that's what they meant no this is what they oh this part of the brain i'm

(3:31:46) in here now this is what they I can't get in your brain i can only utilize your words and then based on the words

(3:31:53) you tell me that's my interpretation of what you're saying but that's not what you said you kept calling me a communist

(3:32:00) yeah because I would get along with because you said you wanted to check out of capitalism to go live on a commune

(3:32:08) farm that Yes of course i thought that sounded a lot like communism farm it's

(3:32:13) It's a family farm like how is that a communal family farm yeah but that's not

(3:32:19) communism we all have jobs and we still communism until you say I want to check out of capitalism we both have jobs we

(3:32:26) all still have jobs i'm still in capitalism i don't understand i'm just explaining to you that these are very

(3:32:33) strange terms issues with capitalism by sharing land and cost of stuff so we can

(3:32:39) actually afford to live that's a com that sounds a lot

(3:32:45) like if you're going to share land and you're going to share that people with a duplex does that mean people with a

(3:32:51) duplex or live with their parents is that communism no just because it's on a

(3:32:56) farm no if you But when you make an prescription No when you make an prescription what I'd like to see people

(3:33:02) do is X right i'm assuming that this has some type of government backing no i

(3:33:08) mean why why government backing to have a farm and No that's not what you said though you said that you want to see

(3:33:15) That's not what you said you see what I mean on the government let's back up that's what I mean okay hang on let's back up very concise language so we're

(3:33:22) not equivocating we're not talking past each other i actually understand what the you're talking about what do

(3:33:28) you actually want to see concisely what do you actually want to see happen for in the government or No just for for my

(3:33:36) life no for what you when you're talking about I want to see communal farm and communal resources what are you talking

(3:33:43) about i want to live with people that I love and we will have we'll buy land

(3:33:50) together and then have separate parcels of land and live happily ever after and I like

(3:33:56) farming so I'm going to use a lot of the land to farm and no one has to okay that's a whole if they want to that

(3:34:02) makes sense but that's a whole different thing yeah that's I was like how am I a communist all right all right okay maybe

(3:34:08) in the future just like be super be Well not even super concise just a little bit concise you all kept calling me a

(3:34:14) chatter box and stuff for trying to explain myself no no no do you And you started laughing before I could even do

(3:34:20) that okay here I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to show you the distinction right so what I would like to see is I

(3:34:27) would like to see capitalism regulated by the government you understood that right but do you really hang on stop stop stop

(3:34:34) stop you understand do you understand what I just said okay here's how you would have said that like it's just when

(3:34:40) talk about government stuff and land the government stuff in the land i

(3:34:46) would like to see it's like a communal you know and then and then like what we can do stop stop let me finish and then

(3:34:54) like what we would do is uh share crop inside of loved ones and margarine hat

(3:35:00) that's hang on that's the distinction like when I tell you something when I when I'm speaking to you I try to be not

(3:35:06) even super concise just at least expressing in hang on in basic terms what my worldview is so that you

(3:35:12) understand it that's how you actually sound to us i I get that but I literally

(3:35:18) had just started talking and y'all were coming at me i'd never been on a podcast before i couldn't really speak without

(3:35:24) y'all like you know if it was a conversation like this I could have articulate articulated that to you

(3:35:30) compared to y'all like coming at me like crazy so and just laughing at me that's

(3:35:35) Well to be fair I don't think Brian laughed at you i think I laughed at you once no he was like he was like "Oh are you are you a feminist you'd get along

(3:35:42) with that girl." That that was his intake I mean take on all of it so you pro probably would get along with that

(3:35:48) girl they're just saying probably was she want a farm you

(3:35:54) know well she wants everybody to be on a giant global farm but yeah um cuz she's a you know she's a

(3:36:02) communist or honest people communist though there was

(3:36:08) a a Marxist feminist who was here oh I saw that i watched that yeah yeah they want they want people on like you know

(3:36:14) the giant communal form basically yeah i don't want to do that yeah probably i I'm introverted i'd rather just like be

(3:36:20) around people I want to be around you know that sounds like a great life to me yeah but you can understand from my

(3:36:26) position i can only understand words that I hear from a person you started

(3:36:32) laughing as soon as I started saying because it was absurd so it's laughable

(3:36:37) i couldn't No I couldn't explain you started laughing before I could even explain my stance on it i know well when

(3:36:43) you're all over the place for like 30 minutes straight literally that was when I had first started talking y'all you

(3:36:49) came at me immediately well I mean I come at people based on what they say what do you want me to do

(3:36:56) if you say certain crazy I'm going to talk to you about it you said that what I said wasn't crazy like living with my family and stuff but I didn't

(3:37:02) but that's not what you said dude i did say no it's not what you said

(3:37:09) it's really not you know I I know you want it to be but it it actually just in fact was not if y'all didn't come at me

(3:54:09) scroll scroll back for sakes f oh man that's the 50K minus what

(3:54:19) the was that you know it is was that me was that

(3:54:24) direct audio of me that was definitely you this is like

(3:54:31) internal Brian um okay let me get through the notes we have uh I think

(3:54:36) wait is that it from from our homie Jen uh the interrupting you said you also don't agree that you're about the

(3:54:42) backpedaling uh oh you don't appreciate being called sexist for basing your man

(3:54:47) and bear answer based off statistics and you wrote you're more likely to be killed by a mosquito than a bear you're

() 

(3:54:53) more likely to be killed by a dog uh more likely to be killed by a bee than a bear you're more likely to be killed by

(3:55:00) a certain species of snail than a bear bear are the second most deadly animal

(3:55:05) on the planet no that was a typo typo that's fine i meant uh men wait bears

(3:55:10) are the No no no no no no no that that was a typo what I meant was uh um men

(3:55:16) are the second most deadly the second you wrote uh mosquitoes are the most

(3:55:21) deadly animal and then and then it's man oh okay so yeah that was a typo

(3:55:28) something on the planet is way f Oh bears are way further down on the list yeah there's all type of uh before you

(3:55:34) looked at the statistic okay and you said mosquitoes mosquitoes are the deadliest yeah that's because of malaria

(3:55:41) oh I know but if you look at a list like there's bears are like on way at the

(3:55:47) bottom because of encounter rates it's per still but still statistics i mean

(3:55:53) wait question why would I if I got a question for you if everybody else here left the room everybody else here left

(3:55:59) the room and you were in here alone and we just pumped the the room full of a

(3:56:04) million mosquitoes you can pick or we drop in like I get it we drop in like

(3:56:10) three bears which do you pick you pick the mosquitoes or the bears i would pick the mosquitoes because if you drop in

(3:56:16) some bears of course they're going to be in attack mode because they'd be like "What the fuck?" Well then you just kind of negated your own argument there no no

(3:56:23) because bears if um if you surprise them they're more likely to attack and if if

(3:56:29) you drop me in another country that has malaria yeah but your argument here that that you stated was that this thing is

(3:56:36) more deadly than a bear men are more deadly than bears bees are more deadly than bears etc etc but when applied when

(3:56:44) situationally applied you still even understanding that mosquitoes one million of them the potential that one

(3:56:50) has malaria is pretty high is probably pretty high right well in the US it's not high hang on hang on but we're in

(3:56:56) the US hang on so anyway you said forest you would pump you would you would still prefer that over three bears dropped in

(3:57:03) which means that just because men are uh deadlier as far as they kill more than

(3:57:09) bears do human beings right and mosquitoes kill more than men do you still would prefer the more deadly

(3:57:16) species of mosquito over bears and this is saying this is just showing you like the context of the situation if you drop

(3:57:24) bears in they're going to be in attack mode automatically because they're going to be freaked out like let you know if

(3:57:29) you're teleporting bears in a room i tell you what we'll give you a tranquilizer gun for the bear situation

(3:57:36) well no i mean what if you give me beads from a different country i mean uh but

(3:57:43) we're in mosquitoes right so like mosquitoes that wasn't in the question you said random i mean yeah in my list

(3:57:50) I'm just listing all of the animals like I mean I wasn't Yeah you said in the

(3:57:55) woods random mosquito in the woods ran a bear um yeah i mean do you want to

(3:58:01) compare that to every animal I listed like the snails or what it just seems a bit like of a disingen disingenuous

(3:58:08) example to give that m like mosquitoes are more deadly i don't think it actually is i'm just saying I based it

(3:58:14) off statistics it's because they're disease carriers because Oh I know that right that was

(3:58:21) just one of the several things i mean I could send you the entire list of animals that are more deadly um if you

(3:58:28) said drop me in the water with a hippo I'd be like or a man right but I would say I would be a man right but I guess

(3:58:35) it would even if the the the mosquitoes we pumped into this room carried malaria I'm actually confident that you would

(3:58:41) all of them had malaria and it's almost assured that you would cap you would get malaria i would not want malaria would

(3:58:49) you ra but if or dropped if they were dropped in this room or what they're

(3:58:54) dropped in this room and you got to stay in the room for 5 minutes and then you can leave i only have one like tranquilizers mind you malaria can be

(3:59:01) treated but Oh I mean if they're dropped in No I I would I would shoot I would

(3:59:07) Okay remove how many people die from malaria you don't get the tranquilizer oh then I mean I'd choose the mosquitoes

(3:59:13) mosquitoes even with malaria I would choose the mosquitoes how about this let me ask you a different way uh would you

(3:59:19) rather be in a in a a jail cell with a bear or with another man for 10 minutes

(3:59:26) a man okay what about a cage a man how about this that's the same

(3:59:32) thing you're at the top of a burning building well maybe not the burning building uh wait I forgot how to jump i

(3:59:40) don't know how there's going to help me we're both kind You're You're at the top of a burning building there's one

(3:59:46) stairwell that you can make your exit through uh do you go and the stairwell can either have a man in it or a bear in

(3:59:54) it i mean the man

(3:59:59) There's not really a way to escape i mean I'm just basing it off the situation you gave me in the in the

(4:00:05) woods you know but so your your objection to it though is that you said

(4:00:10) it was bad faith for you to go around using such a horrendous Wait hold on hold on wait hold on you said that it

(4:00:17) was bad faith for me to go around using such a horrendous term about you like that for using statistics no it's not

(4:00:23) either because here and I'll show you why and the term is sexist i'll actually show you that's what I said yeah but

(4:00:29) I'll actually show you why this isn't a good argument and I'll do it really easy would you rather spawn in a forest with

() 

(4:00:34) a man or a bear you said a man because Oh spawning would be different than You

(4:00:39) said come across as different even come across i said I said man i mean I said

(4:00:45) bear yeah bear exactly okay would you rather come across in a forest a black man or a white man

(4:00:53) um either but I What about statistics um I don't know if them is are they uh

(4:01:00) okay i don't know the statistics on that do I do I i'm just saying like if you

(4:01:05) just want to move off of statistics right i didn't look at the statistics ahead of time on that did Okay so So if

(4:01:11) if one was more dangerous would you pick that one over the other one no i No no you don't want to sound racist do you no

(4:01:18) i mean No i mean if you show me the statistics then I'll say that one i mean

(4:01:25) okay it is what it is just just pointing that out it's just so

(4:01:32) that that's and you can make those statistical arguments back is my point

(4:01:37) right so you got to be got to be cautious with that that's all I'm saying what's your answer to that i mean you

(4:01:42) use statistics all the time in your argument i'd rather be stuck in a forest with a white guy or a black guy yeah

(4:01:48) what is your answer wait me you which one would I rather be yeah with stuck in

(4:01:53) stuck with oh with Yeah probably a white guy okay what uh oh yeah what's wrong with that

(4:02:02) i like What's wrong with that it's just kind of it's crazy to assume not knowing

(4:02:09) anything about either person that we're just going off of I thought we're just going off of statistics

(4:02:16) for like which one's more dangerous or something towards women though I I would have to

(4:02:21) look up well towards men and women in this case for me as a woman I I would have to look up um yeah because

(4:02:28) I think murders for black guys are mostly black on black And white guys are the

(4:02:36) ones that are killing still more dangerous yeah but not not towards women though i don't know i'd have to more

(4:02:41) dangerous towards women too i don't know statistically just saying

(4:02:48) serial killers PDF files and school shooters all white people i'd have to

(4:02:53) look that up

(4:03:00) are you saying for the whole world no the if the listen here's the idea the

(4:03:06) idea is just this that is true would you rather be spawned in a forest with a bear or a man the idea is women who pick

(4:03:12) man say because man more dangerous right than bear because man can envision like

(4:03:18) horrible things that he wants to do and the bear won't then maybe the bear will run off or this or that it's like ah I

(4:03:23) see so then you can even reduce that down again okay well then what type of man what if it was this type of man or

(4:03:30) that type of man and generally you get a disingenuous answer from the person because they don't want to tell you the

(4:03:35) truth somehow then which is very bizarre just saying well I'd have to look up

(4:03:40) black on white yeah that's fine we we won't we won't linger on it i'm just pointing it out what about what if you

(4:03:48) were confronted with a woman and we changed it like would you rather be

(4:03:55) confronted by like a woman or a bear type thing what do you mean would you rather open up to a tree you mean would

(4:04:03) I rather spawn with a with a woman or a bear or like would you rather come across a bear or a woman women a a woman

(4:04:11) a woman and that's and that's really easy right but there's tons of women that would choose the bear you're

(4:04:18) kidding no I'm just saying like which one I'm just saying because one is

(4:04:24) scarier to come across right i don't think anyone would choose the the bear and if it was between bear and

(4:04:32) woman because women are kind of well I think most women still would actually

(4:04:37) choose man if they thought about it for a second but they don't think they usually think about it very much they

(4:04:43) just kind of do a knee-jerk reaction though just saying and all of a

(4:04:48) sudden by the way here's why I know it's disingenuous the answer from most women is because suddenly every woman who

(4:04:54) answers this question is a hiking forest genius Somehow they're like "Oh I've been

(4:05:00) camping my entire I've been camping my entire life and I I know how to do all sorts of survivalist stuff." And then

(4:05:06) then when I press them on what survivalism they know guess how much they actually know nothing nothing

(4:05:14) you do huh yeah you're a survivalist are you i mean not an expert but yeah a

(4:05:19) little bit do you have a go bag or a bugout bag

(4:05:25) do you have a I keep one in my car see what I mean emergencies that's what I mean right they're all survivalist

(4:05:30) rations do you like stock rations oh no i want to like I've got I need to build mine up i got like a I got a weak supply

(4:05:38) it should be more it should be more oh yeah i I want more needs more actually I

(4:05:43) just moved so I don't really have anything like that but that is my goal to have you got you got a setup like in

(4:05:50) case I mean I'm in Texas there's hurricanes and crap like we deal with all that

(4:05:56) stuff all the time so you kind of have to have all of those resources yeah you know Andrew it's great talking about We

() 

(4:06:02) should start a survival show you and me Dude I'll be on it do you have with bears do you have a setup in the forest

(4:06:08) with bears andrew's got a plan boys versus girls hit the fan like you have a bugout bag let's see who can survive

(4:06:16) longer me versus you i bet I could i doubt that let's do it we'll get a lot of views

(4:06:22) where are we putting you guys i'll tell you what then but there has to be bears wait let's do this there has to be bears

(4:06:28) in the forest let's do it right we're going to put them there you if I mean I think California has black die is that

(4:06:36) what you're saying well no i mean we can have No we have to die in the forest there there has to be some sort of prize

(4:06:41) or something and Oh I thought you me like do it like a survival show if we die we die oh no see who uh like Oh

(4:06:48) i can't get water yes I'm dead no let's see who can survive like you can tap out

(4:06:54) see who can survive in the wilderness i thought it was a situation where like oh  I wasn't able to get like drinking

(4:07:01) water and then like I'm over here with my camera like I'm over here with my I'm poisoned with my like primo

(4:07:09) water just pounding it and you're like Brian can I have some i'm like sorry but here's the rules man first and let's do

(4:07:15) it y'all first the the Yeah we go in different parts of the forest we just get a knife that's it yeah we can agree

(4:07:21) on on whatever sort a knife or maybe we can pick like Wait hold on let me I

(4:07:27) would rather an axe can we Can we make it a knife hold on a knife and a loin cloth is fair the naked thing i don't

(4:07:35) want to be naked and afraid i was watching Apocalyptto yesterday no we can make money off of this and I can prove

(4:07:41) that I actually do know survival stuff and they can prove that they're all big and manly so would you eat the endtrails

(4:07:48) of a squirrel you saw me eat an octopus on the freaking That is I've eaten bugs

(4:07:54) so yeah i I did you ready i mean you already lost the bet on on the hundred bucks so

(4:08:02) what let's bet on this or like do some sort of show i would love to mhm that

(4:08:08) would you know I You would get a lot of views on that wanting to produce a series like the survival show it's been

(4:08:15) done already but like we put a group of men on an island and some women on an island but instead of like it's

(4:08:21) feminists on the island oh god so it's not even like survival chicks do I count as a feminist i think so so I want to be

(4:08:29) on it ogle are you watching this do you want to be a executive producer on my We need funding for this cuz islands are

(4:08:35) funding stop buying champagne for a bit and just put it into the funding of this of the show feminists you know

(4:08:42) feminists there should be a winning prize ice cream in case they decide to Sorry what you you we need like a

(4:08:49) winning prize or something okay so what So let me ask you this right a winning

(4:08:54) prize and and this is funded on this side of it what do you bring to the table so that y'all are getting money

(4:09:00) too from views yeah but what do you get what do you bring for the state okay i want to say that they're paying for it

(4:09:07) not you it's much more fun to watch watch the ladies ladies it's great that brings a lot of viewers in general a lot

(4:09:14) more viewers than this and you're getting paid through that great television

(4:09:19) i do my own content when there's no women around well this is I bet this would get a lot more views than that

(4:09:25) bring some food though that is true occasionally beer and off camera you

(4:09:30) wouldn't be funny she's wearing a burka for all we know

(4:09:36) probably you know I was thinking about Never mind are you an I would love to do this it sounds fun what do you What do

(4:09:43) you like what beer um I like piss water beer

(4:09:50) sometimes he slums it and drinks a bud didn't you say you don't even like hiking so I mean I think that I Yeah

(4:10:04) executive producing that's not fair why is that not fair so it's like me versus you that's what

(4:10:12) you wanted 5 seconds ago yeah okay fine let's do it that'd be a vacation for me i don't know what you're talking

(4:10:18) about it's got to be a ton of girls well then it needs to be a ton of guys then right yeah

(4:40:19) should i don't think Andrew is actually upset it's just that in principle he's not willing to let you off the hook

(4:40:25) because as he said a man would have been subject to a different set of circumstances for the same behavior

(4:40:31) correct and you would have treated a man differently too I think yeah but don't

(4:41:50) and a half incher wow very respectful that's funny honestly good to know

(4:41:56) George proud of you good for you i am proud of you uh wait so going into the

(4:42:02) notes here Priscilla you said that uh the show has misogynistic undertones and

(4:42:09) implications and I think that that's I had that those in your notes before

(4:42:15) you came on last time i don't remember or you came on the show with Sav and

(4:42:22) then you sent me these notes so but you got kicked off so we didn't get to get into it so the show has misogynistic

(4:42:28) undertones and implications how do you define misogyny

() 

(4:42:34) misogyny is when men have general contempt for women

(4:42:41) okay I'll accept that so um what are the misogynistic undertones and implications

(4:42:48) pertaining to the show or things I say or Andrew says or Sap says

(4:42:55) so when you I think some of the things you don't know that it's happening because you can only see it from a male

(4:43:01) perspective but did you just assume my gender

(4:43:11) go on i don't want to be that is what I truly believe that's why I said that

(4:43:18) like I'm not to be um undermining or anything but I mean I

(4:43:24) do think like for example like I think it would be like if I were to have men

(4:43:31) come into a podcast in a similar way and I was the host and I was just like

(4:43:38) how much money do you make do you think that and just started saying a bunch of stereotypes for men like do you think do

(4:43:46) you think like the view I have not seen it but yeah like the C I

(4:43:52) do want to say that both I don't think that the I can understand how you guys are both pushing back but I do think

(4:43:58) it's extremes like there's feminist push back to to your extreme and then your

(4:44:04) extreme to the feminist push back and it just feels very hateful on both sides

(4:44:11) like I don't understand when women hate men and I don't understand when men hate women do we hate women that's what I

(4:44:19) feel i don't know if you hate them but I feel like you have content you feel you feel that we hate women it seems that

(4:44:26) it's been displayed that you have general contempt because I don't think Okay i don't think that

(4:44:34) having judging people for their life choices has anything to do with dating

(4:44:40) in general i think it's just to knock down their character yeah but that's personal what no it's not personal it's

(4:44:47) the idea is if you're having a dating podcast then there's people have all sorts of preferences when it comes to

(4:44:53) dating because they have all sorts of preferences when it comes to dating they're going to take things into account like body count your sex life

(4:44:59) your sexual past you're going to make all sorts of judgments that's going to be out in the open that you're and you're talking about those things so

(4:45:05) only when you're romantically involved otherwise it's not anyone's business yeah but the whole point of it is to

(4:45:10) discuss what people are interested in when it comes to romantic involvement and so you're getting people's stories

(4:45:16) what it is that they're talking about what it is that they're discussing they make all sorts of value judgments about us we make value judgments about them

(4:45:22) everybody makes value judgments about  everybody because that's how the human experience operates we make value

(4:45:28) judgments about each other all the time non-stop every day all the time but then the best way to deal with that is to say

(4:45:36) okay I don't want somebody that does A B C i don't want this so then you don't

(4:45:42) pick that person but but to say that it has to be this way or that way for

(4:45:47) someone it's not not everyone has the same standards we're not saying they do

(4:45:53) right so it doesn't matter your body count really it doesn't matter it doesn't follow at all so like so here

(4:45:59) maybe it matters to you this person doesn't want me why and then they say because A B and C and then you ask the

(4:46:06) person well why is that why is that that you wouldn't want a person like this and then they're going to give their reasons

(4:46:11) and then other people are going to push back against that because maybe they think the reasons are bad this is just a

(4:46:16) simple value judgement value assessment that everybody has right we we can all decide what is appropriate and what our

(4:46:24) expectations are but it's different for every person like I some men might care

(4:46:30) about the body count some men might not some men might not in dispute right okay

(4:46:37) like that's literally not in dispute i agree there's got to be at least some men out there who don't care about body count i agree no dispute and I don't

(4:46:45) think preferences of any kind are bad like it's all personal i think there's

(4:46:51) some bad preferences like if you want to ddle kids that's a pretty bad preference i was going to say

(4:46:57) pretty bad preference no for your partner smoker's cough

(4:47:03) like I don't think any preferences for your partner are bad like what if you wanted your partner to be 16 that seems

(4:47:08) pretty bad that's way different though no it's just

(4:47:14) a it's a preference right it's just a really bad preference

(4:47:21) well that's that's illegal versus legal like yeah but what does that have to do

(4:47:27) with pref like if it was illegal to have sex doggy style I assume people would still do it isn't it in some states sure

(4:47:34) and I assume people in those states no I think anoles

(4:47:39) isn't that sodomy i think even the UCMJ had has a sexual

(4:47:44) morality code the uniform code of military justice but I'm just saying pretty confident soldiers still do that

(4:47:50) right so and the legality of the thing really has nothing to do with the preference of

(4:47:56) what you want to do right but we would just objectively say some things are just bad preferences and wrong and we

(4:48:02) don't want them and they need to go away because we don't prefer

(4:48:09) them and I don't prefer any preferences but mine therefore mine should be legislated forever and everybody should

(4:48:15) follow them at all times okay yeah that's Christian nationalist viewpoint

(4:48:23) well I mean that's just the viewpoint of subjective morality right uh I'm going

(4:48:29) to do some Venmo Cash App shoutouts because a couple came through uh Randy thank for the five on Venmo joseph thank

(4:48:34) for the hundred on Cash App he says for insert thumbs up for all of chat thank

(4:54:11) you're going to get it um it is true though it is true i'm like 10

(4:54:17) more minutes and it's two hours later it's two hours later i know um Priscilla you said in your notes you think

() 

(4:54:22) focusing so much on looks is toxic because that was our big disagreement the whole rating one to 10 thing let's

(4:54:29) go around the table what do you rate your looks on a scale of 1 to 10 i'm not playing that game i've seen those clips

(4:54:34) there's no right answer what do you mean wait i mean there is actually a right answer there is a right answer what is

(4:54:40) it well the truth we would Yeah the truth actually that's usually the right answer you don't play that game i think

(4:54:46) looks are subjective just because I may say "Oh I think I'm this number." There's obviously going to be people who disagree with me into there's obviously

(4:54:53) going to be people who disagree with me and that's totally fine but I'm not playing you can't pick seven 100%

(4:54:59) completely don't disagree with you all looks are subjective based on the

(4:55:04) you the person right so from your subjective view you the person what do

(4:55:11) you rate yourself just on pure looks oh my god oh I'm not answering the question I'm not

(4:55:20) Why cuz the same thing happens every single time that what that happens on this

(4:55:26) podcast what happens you question my answer no actually we

(4:55:31) usually don't question most women's answer oops we only question it like Yeah so like if there's a like a literal

(4:55:39) land whale perhaps who uh managed to blow hole its way into the studio and

(4:55:44) then says "I'm a 10 i'm an objective 10." Uh we might give a bit of push back

(4:55:51) on that but generally speaking um not really like we don't really give too

(4:55:56) much push back on i have here watch check this out what do you rate your looks on a scale of 1 to

(4:56:02) 10 11 six

(4:56:10) not biting the bait i would choose seven you should bite the bait though because you didn't say all that much on the

(4:56:15) podcast so you this is your opportunity i know there was you a lot of things about this podcast that are a lot

(4:56:20) different than I thought not in a bad way not dogging you we believe in you

(4:56:26) believe in you will we will we move on so we can all go eat if I give you a number boundaries are bad nine

(4:56:34) do you mean that though i don't know i feel like you're lying and now we have to drag the show on so

(4:56:41) I have a lot of confidence i couldn't do what I do for a living if I didn't have confidence realistically so is it

(4:56:48) confidence or hubris i'd accept either it's self love

(4:56:56) pride ego um oh yeah

(4:57:04) is it um

(4:57:13) what is it makeup wipes they look like she's wearing makeup i have to look at the ingredients first i have allergies

(4:57:19) oh oh that's the allergies if I come back on the show I'm going to bring back a good a good one that doesn't cause

(4:57:26) women it did make me break out i won't lie allergies to the wipes but not the makeup no we're everyone says you need

(4:57:33) like the mellar water or whatever it's called i'll bring you some water it's like a It's a And you use paper towel

(4:57:40) and No it doesn't yeah priscilla is a 10 wait Priscilla tell us a guy who's a 10

(4:57:48) um no she said she's an 11 well I I do think it's wrong to to care about looks so but you you're just saying like a

(4:57:55) very handsome man in general anyone that you think is a 10 a guy who you think is

(4:58:00) a 10 like but uh name somebody who's like a famous or celebrity so people can

(4:58:07) see because if you say oh Bobby from the 7-Eleven wait guys just if you can just be quiet

(4:58:14) you guys have any celebrity no who do you who like think of a celebrity that you think is a 10 male celebrity

(4:58:24) I don't know I've gone through phases like I used to think Mario Lopez was really attractive when he did Save by

(4:58:31) Bell okay young Mario Lopez in the 90s or whatever and now he's still a good

(4:58:37) looking guy what else also Orlando Bloom is a 10 he's pretty attractive too okay

(4:58:43) so Orlando Bloom and Mario Lopez i think those are good jumping off points do you think

(4:58:51) that's Is the Discord still up Nick oh like do do we is that compar do you

(4:58:58) think that they're equal for men and looks as you are when you say that you're an 11 do you

(4:59:04) think that that you're in the same league as those guys these are also men that wear makeup too

(5:00:25) brad Pitt what do you rate Brad Pitt oh this is good what do you rate Brad Pitt like young Brad Pitt young Brad Pitt um

(5:00:38) you know what do you rate young Brad Pit holy just cuz I don't think he's attractive doesn't mean he's kind wait

(5:00:45) hold on type young just not my type that's all he's not ugly

(5:00:54) i'm so sorry that upset you so much i'm very upset right now what would you rate him young Brad

(5:01:01) Pitt i mean people like looks maxer types are going to disagree because of the

(5:01:06) epicanthal tilder or some  uh Brad young Brad Pitt is like

(5:01:11) a 10 eight nine to me probably a 10 okay he's at least a nine he's Yeah you think

(5:01:17) young Brad So you're a nine at all you're a nine brad Pitt couldn't get her brian Brad young Brad Pitt couldn't get

(5:01:26) Yeah she's She's out of his league

(5:01:31) dating down she's dating them sixes she would be settling for young Brad Pitt yeah yeah she'd be settling yeah that's

(5:01:38) a reach well you That's why I don't like this game well wait if you say you're nine he's a six then you would be

() 

(5:01:46) settling okay just Just saying like that would be how

(5:01:52) that would work right that is That is how this game works isn't it yeah it's a fun game bro i try to not play i got

(5:01:59) peer pressured can I say that's why it's bad to focus on looks because saying dating down or

(5:02:06) dating up that doesn't make sense cuz we're all way more complex than just

(5:02:12) what we are on the outside mhm yeah i believe you when you're dating like a hunchback with half his

(5:02:18) face melted off and you can see his teeth and he only has one eye and terrible hygiene right then I would be like "Yeah you don't care about looks

(5:02:24) it's you don't you just care about what's inside you can see my dating history just care about what's inside they don't look like that i promise they

(5:02:32) don't look like that i'm shocked i'm actually shocked hold on

(5:02:38) brad Pitt and Fight Club i'm actually

(5:02:45) shocked i don't get shocked very often on the show like with especially with the rating like girls say I'm a 10

(5:02:50) blah blah blah but like you said you're a nine you said young Brad Pitt is a six

(5:02:56) can't believe that was the most flabbergasting thing I've said on this show so So based on everything else I've said yeah all that whatever that other
