(0:00) I don't think you know what American values are I don't think you know what this country was founded or built upon and I think you guys are obsessed with a cult leader who is taking the entire
(0:07) Republican party off of a everything he say he do Trump is Gangster remember can you give me one thing you don't like about Trump I love everything about TR I
(0:13) know because it's a cult thank you it's not a cult hey my name is Steven bonell online I'm known as Destiny I debate
(0:20) Politics on YouTube at youtube.com/ Destiny today I'm surrounded by 20 Trump supporters
(0:30) my first claim is that Donald Trump is unfit to be the US
() 
(0:39) [Music] president pleasure to meet you yeah
(0:45) pleasure to meet you all right so you say that President Trump is unfit to take the presidency why is that I would
(0:50) say that one of the most important values that we have As Americans is our form of government and things like respecting the peaceful transfer of
(0:56) power um I think that being able to concede when you've lost an election is really important so I would argue that the events that took place leading up to
(1:02) and on January 6th are in and of themselves among a whole bunch of other actions immediately disqualifying for
(1:08) the opposite presidency okay so Steve let's talk about January 6th what happened that day in your mind and why does that disqualify president Trump I
(1:14) think that Donald Trump was unwilling to accept the results of the elections I think that he fabricated slates of electors in order to have his vice
(1:22) president pick him to be the winner in the capital building on January 6th even though he didn't have the votes or the
(1:27) evidence to support it I think that is aolly undemocratic thing I think that it is destructive and undermines our Democratic process of governance do you
(1:34) attribute the violence on January 6 to Trump uh largely yes okay why um I think that Donald Trump had been stoking the
(1:40) Flames a year before the election saying that the election was going to be rigged I think that Donald Trump um stoked all
(1:46) of these claims basically with no evidence and then I think that he continued to stoke the Flames while fabricating them that the election had
(1:52) been stolen that there was voter fraud and then he invited people on the day of the certification telling them that
(1:58) their election uh had been stol and their country was being taken from them they needed a fight like hell or they were going to lose everything he knew
(2:03) what he was inviting them there for he knew what he was asking them to do he knew yeah he also told them to enter to go down to the capital peacefully and
(2:09) patriotically right what time protesters first go into the capital what time did they first enter the capital I think it was around 10:00 a.m. I think is when
(2:16) the capital grounds were breached no no 2:11 p.m. no to be clear that's not true
(2:21) 2:11 p.m. is when protesters first entered the United States capital there's there's the grounds that were
(2:26) secured outside though those grounds were breached while Trump was still giving his speech at the okay let's talk about the entrance of
(2:31) the capital because that would be more severe in your mind than simply walking onto the property right can you concede that point probably not I think they
(2:37) were all really bad but okay well entering the capital let's just Mark that point 211 what should Trump have
(2:43) done at that point as soon as the capital grounds themselves were breached he probably should have put out a statement on social media telling people
(2:49) that they needed to go home instead of telling them that Pence had failed them and basically encouraging the violence to continue so what if I told you at
(2:55) 2:38 p.m. president Trump tweeted stay peaceful he tweeted that to his supporters stay peaceful 27 minutes
(3:02) later he tweeted that after Ashley babot I believe had already been shot and killed okay so what does it mean when you tell your people to stay peaceful
(3:08) they're not being peaceful that doesn't 2:38 p.m. 27 minutes after the capital had been protesters had entered he said
(3:14) stay peaceful okay at 3:13 he said Law and Order at 4:17 he posted a video
(3:20) saying go home now so what on Earth was he supposed to have done I'm not happy about some of the violence that we saw
(3:27) on January 6th but let's put it in context well wait wait you just said it you just said what he should have done the tweet that he did at
(3:34) 417 video that was the third the third call it was no it was the first time
(3:39) that he told them to go home that stay peaceful 27 minutes after the capital
(3:45) protested under the after Ashley babett had already been shot and killed they weren't being peaceful why are we saying stay peaceful at this point already do
(3:52) matter a reding hold on do you acknowledge that people broke into the capital what do you mean by break into the capital as and smashed with they
(3:59) enter illegally they, people were there that day how many were charged with crimes 100,000 people there how many
(4:04) charged with crimes do you acknowledge that people how many were charged with crimes then how many people in the BLM rights were charged with crimes this is
(4:09) red herring how many people you said they're violent how many were there that day 100,000 how many were charged with crimes it's the largest FBI
(4:15) investigation history 1,550 at all have been charged with crimes how can you say they were all
(4:21) violent it's not how can you say they were all violent the first people that got into the capital did they break January 6 your only reason why he's un
(4:27) wait wait did the first people into the capital break in is is January 6 the only reason he's unfit are you unwilling
(4:32) to answer that question is January 6 the only reason you unwilling to you can say yes you don't want to answer it and then move on because you know the
(4:37) implications are terrible for you that's fine if you want the reality of the situation is the reality of the situation is people
(4:43) the delay the ceric the number one issue for they delayed the certification of the vote voters it doesn't you're the
(4:49) vote was certified was it not certified did was there a delay in the certification delay in the certification it was because the National Guard showed
(4:56) up and they kicked the people out after Donald Trump was forced to tell them they were going home watching them break in for 3 hours do nothing by your own ad
(5:03) a let's have a productive convers we're not having you're answering any right questions keep going okay yeah I asked you a very simple question the first
(5:08) person that got into the capital who wasn't allowed in how did he get in they walked into the capital no they
(5:14) broke in with the riot shield that he stolen from an officer okay and that makes president Trump unfit for office do you acknowledge that that happened
(5:20) are we living in the same reality right now do you acknowledge that that happen there was violence on January 6th I acknowledge that there's 100,000
(5:26) specific you know what 1 plus one is I do what is 1 plus one it's two okay okay good okay we can answer question ma is
(5:33) racist math is racist first person the first person that got into the capital building how did they get in you were arguing that Trump is unfit try this do
(5:40) you know what 2 plus two is I I four who was the first person into the capital building how did he get in why did I
(5:45) just say he broke is your entire argument about January 6 yes or no well my biggest argument right now is that conservatives are delusional and they
(5:50) don't exist in the same reality that we do so why must you attack 75 million voters pause you've been voted out by
(5:56) the majority please return to your seat thank you yeah thanks [Applause]
(6:09) hi hi how's it going how are you pry good see you again yep so you don't think Donald Trump is fit for office
(6:15) based on January 6th however things yeah however we have to admit that January
(6:21) 6th was compromised there were patriots and there was antifa there were people who yes there were actually I have video
(6:27) of it don't argue don't argue me because I actually have video of people who are on the ground who I have video of people
(6:32) in Black Block getting dressed up in mega gear and according 1420 first of all you don't have a video but let's see
(6:38) how long I the video was the first person to break into the capital was it antifa it was an antifa person yes it was and it's actually if you rate Andy
(6:45) know's book about antifa un it actually talks about how they use the premise of a broken window to then allow other
(6:51) people to come in because people are a mass they're a group they're like a like herd of cows and when there's a broken
(6:57) window they don't see anything wrong with walking into a building if the window's already broken they I thought conservatives with the party of Law and
(7:02) Order if you were outside somebody's house and you saw somebody breaking walk this example is even continued through BLM and the riot talk about BLM right
(7:09) now Al I'm it took us 40 seconds it's not patter in 2020 is the is the same that happened in January 6th where we
(7:15) had innocent people moving into a facility that they didn't know that they was wrong because the doors were already open so you're already they were there
(7:22) was broken the doors that were being broken into yes by when they were not Maga you
(7:30) have so were all of the indictments and the convictions for people like Enrique tario for Stuart rhods all these people that have been directly involved all the
(7:36) video footage of which one of these people was his Commander name one of the commanders of the Insurrection and RAR
(7:41) was the CEO of The Proud boy steart road is is a commander is he a commander in the offal military name the lieutenant
(7:47) in the Insurrection name the an Insurrection is going to have people like commanders generals captains people
(7:54) no it doesn't need to all the problem had a leadership structure if you like you go and read the IND
(8:00) there was no leadership structure it can't be an Insurrection if there is no leadership structure you can't even name one of Donald Trump's commanders in this
(8:06) and all gent already gave you the CE of the they the ones that Trump made four
(8:12) tweets and those four tweets didn't even make it out of his his sphere because they were immediately suppressed by the
(8:18) media wed they were they were deleted they were deleted they were deleted by Twitter TW he brought them out on stage
(8:26) on his town hall and said look here are the tweets that you deleted how do you explain that other than fist system
(8:34) Donal explain yeah the calls for peace came 3 hours while he wait so do you wa
(8:39) do you acknowledge do you acknowledge that Donald Trump sat in his in his room for three hours before he told people to
(8:45) go home watching the violence unfold you won't answer a question Donald Trump gave a speech you don't care about the
(8:50) fact I don't no no I'm the one I'm asking a very simple question you I can answer your question if you answer my question do you acknowledge that he sat
(8:57) for 3 hours no he didn't sit for 3 hours because he gave a speech during those 3 hours no at the very end he went after
(9:03) the ellip speech was done he went back to the White House and then he sat in a room with a Diet Coke and he watched the
(9:09) violence how you know this because it's accounted for by like testimony were you there how do you know what's happening
(9:14) at the border what's happening in are you there what do you mean actually this gentleman is actually hold on are you I'm sorry is your claim that the only
(9:20) way that you can know something is if you personally you're making these claims that he sat I'm making this claim based on hundreds of hours of deposition
(9:26) testimony by people that have been in front of a number of in front of the j6 committee in front of the media in front of the there are so many different
(9:33) people that are willing to testify to all of this pause you've been voted out by the majority please return to your
(9:42) seats hey what's up so um I think that you know we've
(9:47) been talking about January 6 um I I'll I'll be the first to say that and and I think a lot of people here would agree
(9:53) that there were bad actors that day um I'm someone who comes from a family of law enforcement family of military so I
(9:58) believe in Law and Order and so I do believe that there were people on that day who took things way too far and I
(10:04) think most most Republicans understand that um from people that I had talked to on the ground um I think that the media
(10:11) blew it up into something bigger than it was again I'm not saying that people who broke into the capital shouldn't have
(10:17) but I do believe that there's a lot of people who are misled you know there's evidence that's coming out with uh all
(10:23) the tapes that are coming out from January 6th showing police officers were actually escorting people through the
(10:29) hallways so to say that every single person who entered that building is you know a criminal I I think a lot of
(10:35) people just to be clear that's never been my claim that every single person entered was the building is such a
(10:40) boring and uninteresting I would never waste my time making it the reality was I do agree with you and your fundamental there are a lot of people that were
(10:46) misled I do agree with that and I think that Donald Trump was behind that misleading the entire time the people
(10:51) were there because he was tweeting out at them saying come here for a historic protest it was obvious what the protest was going to be they were protesting the
(10:57) certification of the vote and what president Trump never told anyone to break into the capital president Trump
(11:03) has always run on a campaign of Law and Order and to respect his police okay where has he where's your evidence of
(11:08) that the whole plot on January 6 was to break the law to have Mike Pence choose him to be the president what at what
(11:14) point did President Trump tell people to break into the capital and when he wanted Pence to choose him to be the
(11:19) president no no no but but they talking about breaking law breaking the law that's that's breaking the the law was
(11:24) the Electoral count act you wanted to break that law what you're saying is that you had that he was inciting an an
(11:32) Insurrection he was inciting an Insurrection and telling people to
(11:37) people they needed to fight like hell or they were going to lose their country said that they need how does that have anything to do with breaking into the
(11:43) capital yes let me just let so just to be clear so he told people to go to j6 because it would be a historic something a historic
(11:51) event when they all got there and they showed up at his speech at the ellipse for an hour he rils them up telling he's
(11:56) going to lose they're going to lose their country that um they're trying to steal it from you that you need to fight like hell juliani was just on there
(12:02) before saying trial by combat um he said all these things and then all these people he said we're going to March down psylvia they all marched to the capital
(12:08) is there anything wrong with protesting outside I'm asking like was the fact that there was a break into the capital and for the first time in US history the
(12:14) vote was the vote certification was delayed was that just a coincidence is that that I just I just want to know
(12:20) that before you ask a bunch of random question was that was it just a coincidence that a Breakin happened and the vote was delayed was that a
(12:26) coincidence because people broke into the capital that can't be blamed on President Trump he always Co president Trump
(12:32) has president Trump has always ran on Law and Order and for people and yes there were there were bad act there were
(12:38) bad actors but mov let's move to the certification nothing about in6 in in
(12:47) 2016 I've already said that there were bad actors in 2016 Democrats questioned
(12:52) the election of President Trump yes they did she concede he's not going to answer
(12:58) this question Sheila Jackson Jackson Sheila Jackson and another like two
(13:03) other Democrats had spoke and said that they were going to question and to uh
(13:09) hopefully delay the certification in 2016 what president Trump was election
(13:14) and look the answer is that night right the answer is that night was the certification of the vote delayed the
(13:20) answer is no it was was there a right of the capital of I am from Arizona I was in the middle
(13:27) of the elections in 22 I've been there I saw what happened in 2020 there are serious questions about what there you
(13:36) think I'm from Arizona I work from Arizon you didn't I don't care that you worked in every single cour case on this
(13:42) failed for good reason right it's failed on standing no that's not true a lot of them were Talk evid number one and
(13:48) number two wa wait do you agree standing let me get to my point let me get to my point you have no point fabri
(13:53) information time in 4k there is serious that's they Broast there serious
(13:58) question you've been voted out by the majority please return to your
(14:07) seat I'm way behind you so I just see the back of your head okay I'm sorry try to I just have questions I'm I'm more I
(14:14) I like to ask people questions I just I'm interested in in hearing how people think so when you're talking about the
(14:20) Insurrection on January 6 what would you describe during when Kavanaugh was elected to Supreme Court and you had all
(14:26) the protesters at the capital they were banging on the capital doors they were screaming they were yelling what how do
(14:31) you feel about that uh I would have to know the specifics of the event I don't recall like any like proceedings being
(14:37) delayed I don't recall there being a top- down call from the president to lead you don't remember that they had to stop the Congressional meetings because
(14:43) people were banging on the door and being so loud and trying to break their proceedings for if they did then it's bad wait wait just to be clear wait wait
(14:49) just to be clear this is the difference between me and you okay is that if everything you're telling me is true I'm
(14:55) a female I'm a female America great I'm a female yeah put it on I had a cow
(15:00) talking I'm a female and you're a male and it's almost like you're attacking me because I'm a female are you anti female
(15:06) are you anti female half the time I am okay what I'm saying right now I'm saying what I'm saying I'm very honest what I'm say yes I am honest which I'm
(15:12) saying thatwe can I ask you another question I didn't even answer your first question no you said that you didn't know the specifics that is I'm not going
(15:19) to force I'm not going to force you into a yes or I promise you can't force you to anything okay I'm not if if it happened as you say I would say that's
(15:25) bad and you know what the people involved should be arrested you're still yelling I agre with you I'm not yelling I'm not even close to yelling yet I can
(15:31) if you want me to I'm glad you are projecting your voice cuz I couldn't hear you before okay so I can definitely hear you now you could do that maybe hair on your ear go ahead you want my
(15:37) hair behind my ears if it's inhibiting your ability to hear me speak yes well actually it's because you need the
(15:42) bottom of your I I'm in in the medical field so the bottom of your tongue needs to be clipped so uh that's the reason
(15:48) why you have a list when you're talking anyway if you want medical advice I can do that but it's better to be priv on
(15:53) that I have another question so we agree that during the cavana trials if people were trying to break into the Supreme Court
(15:59) I agree with you on that so and the next thing is I have a question for you because you also brought it the border and immigration right
(16:06) well did they can play it back so anyway what would you say if the Biden Harris
(16:11) we have the Biden Harris Administration right now if our border was filled with neones with tiki torches what would
(16:17) happen you'd probably sell a whole lot more lighter fluid I don't know what do you mean no our border pause sorry
(16:23) you've been voted out by the majority
(16:35) Micah um okay I want to talk about the alternate slate of electors um and how
(16:41) historically that has happened before on the Democrat side yes it has in uh 1960
(16:47) JFK against Nixon ran an alternate slate of electors um in case it was overturned
(16:54) in Hawaii um it was eventually overturned in Hawaii and so then those electors were certified and um JFK won
(17:02) the state so I'm glad you bring this up real quick because this is one of the biggest piece of sh talking points you guys always bring up but I don't know why in 1960 two slates of electors were
(17:09) authorized by the state legislature both were granted the certificate of ascertainment from the governor because they knew that it was a very close
(17:15) election and they'd authorized a recount and because that recount was going to go past the December some mid December date
(17:21) it's December 14th for the 2020 election but some mid- December date for when they had to certify their vote so they said okay well we'll send in vote both
(17:27) certificates and then on the day the counting um on January whenever they would have done the um certification in
(17:33) Congress then they can choose which one was authorized by the state legislature based on the results of the recount
(17:38) Donald Trump's certificates were not authorized by any state legislature do you acknowledge that wait
(17:44) wait real quick do you acknowledge real quick that none of the seven slaves that were by Donald Trump none of those were authorized by any state legislature can
(17:51) I answer you're not going to no I am no no no no no no they they weren't
(17:56) certified and why it's because fraud wasn't found it wasn't proven in court no you're lying you're lying they wer
(18:02) authoriz you're saying fraud was founded no you're lying because those legisl what do you what are you say am I lying
(18:07) about they're lying because none of those alternate slates were arranged by the state legislatures they were arranged by Trump and his criminal
(18:14) co-conspirators none of the state legislators none of the state Governors authorized those slates of electors okay
(18:20) what's wrong with that it's illegal number one and number two what law what law says that in in you have laws that
(18:27) are governing how your supposed to Transit what law what law I do you want me to give you the specific statutes in
(18:34) Georgia Arizona new I I don't know them off the top of my head if you want you can okay so then that's a baseless claim
(18:39) it's not a baseless claim ches ches bro and Eastman you can't provide me a specific law because I can't give you
(18:44) the state statute yeah if you can't give me a specific law then why should I believe you there's no justification for
(18:51) that you have to provide evidence for that are you hold on on the contrary are you claiming there's no formal process
(18:56) that's codified in leg in the legislature for to send your your transmit your electoral votes do they just do it randomly no of course I'm
(19:03) saying of course there's laws that are involved but you can't point to the specific law that says that that is I don't know the numbers your claim is
(19:09) baseless it's it's always crazy to see that you guys will carry water even Trump's own people don't deny this
(19:14) because they know that they're dead to rights because the emails have leaked the conversations have leaked the Twitter posts are there that we can see
(19:21) accounts really what did I just say it was wrong what one thing that I just said it was incorrect you're getting upset because I'm pressing you on no I'm
(19:27) not you're not pressing at all you're getting uping you're like a
(19:32) Magikarp you no idea what you're talking about when you have to result to personal insults that's when you know
(19:37) you're Los you already said that I was lying you can't name a single thing I'm incorrect about I can name multiple things you've been incorrect about you
(19:43) were incorrect now you're not me get a word I think I mean I think you're just speaking for yourself you're making yourself look foolish in this Cas go
(19:49) ahead but okay yeah I mean there's 10 seconds go give me your hardest claim again it was for the same reason you can
(19:56) compare the election of 1960 to 2020 it's the exact same thing they did that
(20:02) in case there were in case their cases actually came to fraud and they found fraud in the election that's time Micah
(20:08) please return to your seat my next claim is that Harris would be a better president for immigration in
() 
(20:14) the Border than Donald
(20:21) Trump oh hey what's up long time to see yeah all right so why would be KLA
(20:27) Harris be better than Trump on immigration cuz I don't know if Trump even knows what's actually wrong with the Border he doesn't know what he's
(20:34) what do you mean by that I think that Republicans don't know what is happening right now with the problems with their immigration system a lot of people think
(20:39) that the issue is with illegal immigration it's not the problem is that our Asylum process is completely and
(20:45) totally broken right now and the problem is the only way to rectify that is to change the laws governing or at least
(20:51) some of the regulations governing the Asylum process and when there was a bill on the table to do so Donald Trump blocked it to keep the Border open for
(20:57) an election issue but as as it stands right now you could have the biggest strongest wall in the world with the best guns and all the people manning it
(21:03) it would make zero difference on illegal immigration they would still come up and claim Asylum and there's nothing you'd be able to do about it so do you think
(21:09) there's problems with illegal and illegal that's what I'm hearing correctly well it's different classifications of immigrants but like
(21:14) Asylum Seekers aren't technically illegal immigrants even though Republicans call them that when they're doing the Asylum seeking process and
(21:20) millions of people are here waiting to hear their case technically that's all legal which is an issue okay but why
(21:26) would KLA harff be better than Trump you said you understand it better I think everybody understands the issue but I think the Democrats and Republicans at
(21:32) least the establishment they don't want to fix the issue so well but if they so I don't think everyone understands the issue so every single person sitting
(21:39) here doesn't believe me when I just said that the laws on the books and the Asylum process are the main issue they think it's just people illegally
(21:44) crossing the border right the reason why I think that the Democrats do something because they're not enforcing laws on the book people that shouldn't be they
(21:51) that's the issue they're enforcing them but there people that are illegal here and they're not being sent back that I mean that's a that's a whole other
(21:57) deportation not enforcing law then well who's they the government which one the state governments or the federal
(22:03) government well the federal government doesn't have the resources to go in and try and find every single potential illegal immigrant in the United States there's a whole bunch of is we send how
(22:09) many billions to Ukraine like we have the money we can hire people there's a lot of people in this country so it can happen so the majority of like 80% of
(22:16) the aid we send to Ukraine is in the form of like used weapons and stuff um but secondly it's just a matter of even if you say we have the money for it I
(22:22) mean we would have to appropriate the funds for it and everything else to do it like it's not a matter of simply saying like oh we're going to Triple the size of the DHS or whatever to do but so
(22:29) now you're saying so I so you want to be tough in Immigration right and you think kis is going to be tough in Immigration
(22:34) just generally speaking like she's going to crack down on it Deport illegal send them home I don't know I don't even I'm not necessarily I'm not talking about
(22:40) being tough on or deporting I'm just saying that to fix the issue we have right now which is way many people coming in and claiming Asylum it's not so the fix of guys stop people coming in
(22:46) so we need to no no the issue is we need to stop the Asylum process or we need to figure out a way to to make that better
(22:51) right but there's multiple things that need to be fixed it's a multifarious issue and KLA Harris originally says
(22:58) that KKK you've been voted out by the majority please return to your
(23:09) seats um I'm Luke by the way nice to meet you um so I just wanted to briefly talk about you're talking about this
(23:15) Senate bill that failed the house what is your argument with that because as far as my knowledge with this bill it
(23:21) was $118 billion that was the financial standing within this bill within that
(23:27) $60 billion of that 118 billion was going to go towards Ukraine only 20 I
(23:32) have the chart with me only $20 billion was going to go towards the Border $10 billion was going to go towards Gaza $14
(23:39) billion was go going to go towards Israel this Senate bill was a bad Bill first off and second off it was just a
(23:45) disguising Bill to give more money towards Ukraine so you talk about the bill
(23:51) that's so this is the argument that was floated initially but the problem is they tried to reintroduce this bill on its own and it still failed Bill itself
(23:58) was was written poorly within the bill they're going to cap uh what is the average weekly immigrations at 5,000
(24:05) that's still way too many people do you know what it's capped at right now what is it capped at nothing that's why it was a good idea 5,000 is still way too
(24:12) much why don't they cap why cap it at less what they allowed it what they allowed it to do what they allowed it to
(24:18) do is it allowed it to say if there were too many people coming in they could put a twoe moratorium and completely shut
(24:24) down people that were coming to the country to seek Asylum that was one thing allowed to now
(24:29) they these are for individual these are the individuals that are not or that are seeking Asylum do you know how many
(24:36) individuals that seek Asylum actually file their paperwork for Asylum well if you come in here l no
(24:43) it's less than half if you're coming here to get a slip to go to Asylum as an excuse the process which comes with
(24:49) people that come for Asylum the easiest and most I guess used process they come
(24:55) typically through San Diego or Arizona they put these individuals on a freight train send that train to New York they
(25:02) house them typically at The Roosevelt Hotel other hotels in New York are also being used then they give them an
(25:08) identification bracelet that has a number basically like Nazi German isine please let me finish talking I'm respect
(25:14) it doesn't matter I'm resp some okay let's talk about the Asylum process
(25:19) right if Democrats wanted to allocate more money to the judges to process the claims faster to allocate more money to
(25:25) border security to make sure people W coming in illegally and then to be able to put a moratorium if too many people were coming in wouldn't all of these
(25:32) things help if only less than 50% of people that are actually coming for
(25:37) Asylum or filing their paperwork none of that matters we should be you getting a
(25:42) slip to to to go to court for an asylum judge if you're not filing your paperwork what I'm saying is these
(25:47) people are using Asylum as an excuse to get to America to use our resources do you know how much money that we've spent
(25:54) so there's two different types of immigrants there well two different types of illegal immigrants there's Goda aways and there's give UPS do you know
(26:00) what each one is uh Catch and Release vers so give UPS give ups are
(26:05) individuals that typically their families are typically Asylum Seekers that they intentionally want to get um
(26:11) processed through border through border control Goda ways are typically criminals which there's 14 14,000
(26:19) murderers right now that are within our country coming through the Border Goda ways alone which are typically criminals
(26:25) we are spending 450 billon million dollar a year just to support these
(26:31) criminals that are coming through through the god away process okay so all of this is great but it returns me back
(26:37) to my other question if people are doing this by abusing the Asylum process
(26:42) MH it feels like a bill would have helped and Donald Trump has done nothing because before we can have any type of
(26:48) Bill that basically funnels down Asylum versus Goda aways versus give up versus criminals versus all that you need to
(26:53) have a secure border yeah but let's say not that was not going to help that was not going to help
(26:59) let's say you SEC the 1 trillion okay tall on the wall and everything everybody else comes up and they still
(27:04) do the exact same Asylum claiming process what do you mean everybody comes up as and you go to a port of entry and you say hey I'm here to claim Asylum and
(27:10) if you have a closed border that has a stricter process for whoever's coming through which one of those processes
(27:15) which was extremely effective was our remain in Mexico act so it wasn't effective yes it was the Biden
(27:21) Administration revoked that act as well as 94 executive orders that Trump installed during its Administration
(27:26) there was a reason that our border had a 50 year alltime low and I want to ask you a question let me ask you question
(27:32) this was coming off OB do you condemn 14y olds two or no
(27:37) number two or no number two he doesn't do you condemn 14y olds being obviously I would condemn 14y I'm not going to
(27:44) play this you cond condem Lincoln Riley's murderer who came in and murdered her who was coming through an
(27:49) illegal Goda away process you condemn I don't care how they got here always you condemn the 321,000 missing children
(27:55) right now that are we cannot find at the border it's I don't even think that number is
(28:02) real, heard all the fake numbers you understand I'm giving you
(28:07) facts right now that are presented through ice that are presented FEA comprehension of the issue it's just
(28:14) numbers you're just regurgitating them compr I'm asking you a very simple question let's say that you secure the Border how does it help the ASL process
(28:20) to get people amped up people are dying kids are being trafficed ask you drug are coming through all 90% of the fol in
(28:27) this country comes in through legal people it's not always traic illegals yes it is during the Biden Administration fentanyl an average
(28:33) yearly pound of fentanyl is 15,000 it's exceeding 15,000 during the Trump Administration it was less than 25
(28:39) that's more numbers that have nothing to do with what we're talking about just random numbers no you have no you don't
(28:44) understand the issue yes I know they facts facts people are dying fact all you're concerned about is trying to be
(28:49) right I'm I'm concerned about the difference is care about people you don't if you don't you don't care don't
(28:56) give would I not care you're supporting the president that blocked the bill that would the problems you don't give a [ __ ] about that our the Riley or the Lincoln
(29:04) riy and all these people getting killed you're thinking yes it's an election issue which is what Donald Trump thought blocked the bill you're saying so you're
(29:11) that I was excited like how you were excited that Cory was you're excited you are excited when a person dies to an
(29:17) illegal immigrant but when something goes to get done about it you Champion Trump when he blocks the bill the bill was a bad bill period really what What
(29:23) legislation did Donald Trump pass in his four years as president he had closed borders he had the remain of Mexico
(29:29) that doesn't sound like a bill remain in Mexico by the way was responsible for keeping like 10,000 immigrants away a
(29:34) year which nothing 42 is co he gets no credit for that next title 42 allowed
(29:39) law enforcement title 42 is gone there's no Co it wasn't covid specific what do you think title 42 was title 42 allowed
(29:47) law enforcement to process illegals that were coming through now they've revoked that if a sheriff or police officer say
(29:53) there's a murderer that comes through illegally if a police officer tries to process that guy and get him him the
(29:58) police officer is going to be charged with kidnapping not the murderer the murderer is just going to get away with this stuff you can't own up to the facts
(30:05) that are actually happing of the criminals that are coming through if someone is truly coming into this country fleeing say it's Venezuela Fe
(30:13) fleeing a South American country or any country that their life is truly at stake everybody here has a heart for
(30:19) them no you don't yes we how dare you family immigrants so how can you say in
(30:25) your world in your ideal world if somebody was escaping one of those countries and coming to the Border you're saying keep them in Mexico until
(30:31) we process them where's the compassion there Mexico is 10 times safer than the country that they you think that the Border towns that are being overwhelmed
(30:38) by people coming to seek ex country oh there it is the protect country yeah so
(30:43) there's no you've been voted out by the majority please return to your
(30:48) [Applause]
(30:55) seat I'm glad we agree that there's a problem with Asylum system and I actually we don't agree I think that but
(31:01) well I'm I'm agreeing with you that there's a problem with the Asylum system I actually think you care I've been following you for a while I actually
(31:07) think you deeply care about this issue and how it's affecting the American people I do believe that sincerely what is the for the tens of
(31:14) millions of folks are going to watch this video just what is Asylum as a process represent to you what does it
(31:19) mean to qualify legitimately for Asylum to legitimately qualify for asyl um there's um there's like official
(31:26) characteristics for it but basically the the place that you're fleeing you're being persecuted for some characteristic
(31:31) or trait that we think that you obviously shouldn't be persecuted for and you're facing like severe threats to your existence and so you have to flee
(31:38) the country and then you're you're basically coming to the United States saying like I'm I'm basically stateless I can't go back to my home like me or my
(31:44) family is at risk and can you you know basically take me in and me become a citizen that way basically that's exactly right you're fleeing racial
(31:49) religious ethnic persecution absolutely poverty wouldn't count as Asylum um I'm
(31:55) just it's a fact poverty doesn't count you have to be fleeing a particular type of persecution if poverty is a coincident Factor there then but the
(32:02) persecution is key sure I'm going to I'm going to hesitantly agree with you but I like like let's say you're pacing facing
(32:07) poverty in like Syria where it's like a collapsed State then it's like I can say that being different but in general yeah if it's if you're just poor you probably shouldn't be able to come here and seek
(32:13) Asylum for that absolutely and and so that's why 90% of Asylum claims are rejected let's talk about remain in
(32:18) Mexico you brought up that you think it was a failure it seems yes why is that um one I think there were a lot of
(32:24) lawsuits in the United States that were starting to look promising I think in terms of returning it I think the ACLU had gotten a victory in the 11th circuit
(32:30) or the nth circuit um and then also because just the number of people that were being kept out from in Mexico I want to say the total number over I
(32:37) think it was like three years was like 30 or 40,000 it wasn't that many like altogether but isn't that actually a
(32:42) sign of its success because it was a successful deterrent think about it this way Stephen if you got people who are fleeing religious persecution and you
(32:49) got folks who are fleeing poverty the people who are actually fleeing persecution they will happily go to
(32:54) Mexico and wait for 6 months for their case to be heard I I don't know if that's always the case well but if
(33:00) you're if you're fleeing and you literally have nothing you're like a destitute family now you're sitting on like a Border Town like waiting months
(33:05) and months maybe for your that's better than religious persecution in Syria right it might be but ideally in the
(33:10) United States we could process you almost immediately and if you have a legitimate claim we can house you here absolutely but how do we keep the fraud
(33:16) out of the system I thought remain in Mexico wherever you are politically was a good way to do that the idea was that if you're actually fleing persecution in
(33:22) Syria or in East Asia or in Africa you would be 99% better off in that camp in
(33:28) Mexico where it is protected where you have food where you have humanitarian resources that keeps the fraud claims
(33:34) out and so did this bipartisan border Bill well first and foremost nine Democrats including Elizabeth Warren
(33:40) actually voted against it so Donald Trump didn't kill it Donald Trump was opposed to it for the same reasons that many Republicans and some democrat clear
(33:46) would that pass would that bill have passed without Donald Trump telling Republicans not to vote for it no it would not have Okay that's completely
(33:52) and totally incorrect what's your pro of that listen let's just talk about the substance of it well the proof is that like it would have passed people like
(33:57) McConnell people like Cruz are literally saying like we're not voting on this bill because Donald Trump has told us to pull plug on it but the idea was it was
(34:03) so what would that bill have done to deter the fraudu and Asylum claims that are keeping out legitimate folks who are fleeing persecution well I think that
(34:10) right now the biggest there there's an amalgamation of laws that make it so that because the Asylum system is so backed up I know that if I go to the
(34:16) United States even my claim is total [ __ ] I can run in run to a port claim that I'm an asylum seeker and I know that they can't process me right
(34:22) now so I get a slip saying okay we'll come back to court in a year or two and it's like I'm in and you're done at that point you just disappear right but if
(34:27) they could process you almost immediately you show up and you're like hey I'm a Sil like oh cool we'll come talk to the judge you're like okay well [ __ ] me then the the motivation to come
(34:34) in and try to get in fraudulently that way I think dramatically decreases and one of the big things that the bill helped with was providing a lot more
(34:39) judges that would be allocated for these things and a lot more funding for it ET just to correct that point there weren actually judges they were filing they
(34:45) were funding custom officers who don't have law degrees who are biased one way who are more likely to approve Asylum
(34:50) claims that might end up proving fraudulent I think wait hold on who processes the Asylum claims If
(34:55) eventually you have to sit in front of a judge understand no no and just just clearly here Customs officers under the
(35:01) bipartisan border bill would be then given authority to process these claims they don't have law degrees they aren't judges judges typically kick these cases
(35:07) but in this particular bill by Langford it would actually be Customs officers taking Customs officers would make the final decision on whether or not a
(35:14) person gets into the and that's how you build up capacity because you couldn't hire more immigration judges there aren't enough people in the country to take those J I think you can I think the
(35:20) issue is that the judge number has been capped since I think the 80s or the 60s in terms of how many judges are allowed to hear these claims so we haven't had
(35:26) more funding that was bring back in Mexico it absolutely Works St because I don't think it necessarily
(35:33) Works number one because not that many people were kept out and number two even as a matter of policy I don't know if the idea to the country to the South you
(35:39) was like Hey listen a ton of people coming to Sal we're going to go and store them in your country while we wait and process it I don't know how even Mexico would feel about that I don't
(35:44) know if the conditions would necessarily be safer for those people either because I thought that one of the claims that I heard so much from the trpes was how
(35:49) unsafe all of these like border towns had become because of so many people building up there so why would you want to stick a legitimate Asylum Seeker
(35:55) there and keep them there would you agree that if somebody was coming here to legitimately seek Asylum and and it
(36:00) was a legitimate case that would probably be good to take them in and house them immediately in an Ideal World absolutely but we need to also separate
(36:06) those who are abusing the system again 90% of those claims are fraudulent but so then would so then shouldn't we
(36:11) increase the funding to process those claims as I think the deterrent is better in Mexico but Stephen let's agree to disagree okay okay awesome
(36:25) great jeez up hi actually he's been snubbed now twice so
(36:32) I I'm sorry I'm going to let him have it hi what's up what's up I'll get next time okay so um my issue with the
(36:38) bipartisan border bill is that it only gets activated on a mandatory basis if there are 5,000 people per day crossing
(36:43) the border I agree with you that the Asylum process is the problem but that bill also expands protections for ases
(36:49) or people seeking Asylum the bipartisan border bill which is a problem I think that hr2 was much more effective at
(36:55) preventing um like people abusing the Le hr2 might have been more effective from a conservative standpoint but that bill
(37:01) was DOA and everybody knew it because Democrats didn't want to vote for it because I don't even know if they would have had Republicans do you think that
(37:06) it would be a win for Democrats if they passed hr2 like politically speaking probably not that bill went much further
(37:12) you don't think that it would be good for Joe Biden's image no I think that I would have to go back and read it because I think that bill was way more
(37:18) extreme in terms of like processing people I don't think it was a very El which I think is a good thing uh there are a couple other things um like I
(37:24) haven't read the bill was D way there was no popular there's no chance in hell that was the bipartisan border bill was terrible too the bipartisan border bill
(37:30) was it was that would have passed less Donald Trump right but it didn't address the current issue there's about 1,000 it did address it it might not you could
(37:36) say it might not address it adequately but it would have been a big step in that direction there there are about okay yeah right but the issue would have to get about twice as bad as it
(37:41) currently is there's about 1,900 people who cross per day currently under the bipartisan border bill on a mandatory
(37:47) basis the emergency Powers could only be activated if 5,000 people crossed over the Border um daily over a 7-Day period
(37:52) right yeah but then after that happens you can shut the border down for 2 weeks and process zero but you can you can
(37:58) only the the bill the emergency powers given in the bill can only be used for 270 days of the first calendar year 225
(38:03) of the second and 180 of the third and in addition to that if it drops below 70% of that mandatory number uh 5,000
(38:09) which is about 3,750 which is almost exactly double what it currently is it gets automatically rescinded the powers
(38:14) go away I don't believe the poers they have the ability how can anybody come in if they're not if they're processing
(38:20) zero claims wait what do you mean if they're processing zero claims once they hit it's the Bas of it's on the basis of
(38:25) crossers so 5 but it shuts down Asylum claims as well that was the nice thing about it we don't have an issue right
(38:31) now with illegal immigrants coming into this country we have a problem right now I know yeah stay mad you guys can't read
(38:36) that's fine the problem that we have right now is with Asylum Seekers agre not ilal immigrant I agree with you and and this bill expanded protections for
(38:43) Asylum Seekers yeah but it also gave the ability for the border to shut downal no two weeks shut down for what is our
(38:50) moratorium right now when people claiming Asylum I I don't know what the me zero it's nothing so this would be better definitionally you said you said
(38:56) earlier that like you were talking about about uh I forget who it was with like the 5,000 cap on a mandatory basis or whatever it's not a cap that's not a cap
(39:03) on like no it's like a sday rolling average yeah yeah let me let me finish it's it's not a cap on how many people can come into the Border obviously zero
(39:09) people are allowed to illegally cross the border right but right people coming C yes yes yes I
(39:15) agree with you let me land my plane okay okay so that's not a cap on how many people can cross the border obviously it's illegal for anybody to cross the
(39:21) border uh it's a cap on power okay pause sorry time's up okay please return to

(40:22) the bar on news and focusing on serving you unbiased straight f facts thanks
(40:28) again to straight Aro news for partnering with us on this episode now let's get into it my next claim is that
(40:34) Donald Trump's economic plans would increase inflation and devastate the
() 
(40:45) economy hi so under the Trump Administration inflation was consistently at 2% under
(40:53) Biden Harris it's 5.5 what do you think the biggest contributor to the in haris inflation has been uh well you could say
(40:59) the um supply chain but I would say the bills that they passed the inflation reduction r with had nothing to do with
(41:06) inflation the only reason inflation's kind of at two and a half now is because they rais interest rates has nothing to
(41:12) do with what they've done okay so what was the huge event that probably triggered a ton of inflation because of
(41:18) all the knock on effects from it there was a really big event that happened in the past five years of Co yeah okay okay
(41:23) so Co happened so if we look at Donald Trump's Administration and we look at what he did he ran massive budget
(41:28) deficits he did nothing to cut spending he did giant tax cuts right and he pressured the FED to keep interest rates well Harris adds like a trillion per
(41:35) year to yeah but at least they can argue for why they would have deficits right because they're trying to save us from a massive recession which more or less
(41:41) they did we already hit recession a couple times not no not really no yeah by the letter of the law we have okay if
(41:46) you want to say that we have that it was a soft landing at worst okay but it's nowhere near as bad as it could have been but at least they had we were coming into economic crisis they
(41:51) probably had to spend for why did Donald Trump run massive budget deficits when he was sitting on a great economy that he inherited from Obama it wasn't a
(41:57) great economy it was an amazing economy the stock markets were posting alltime highs for like three or four years before he even came into office and the
(42:03) guy even higher under him they did they continue to grow yes but why did he have to run budget deficits to do that I mean
(42:08) his trp his tax cuts actually helped everyone it helped me as a middle- class person of course because he did deficit spending deficit spending always helps
(42:14) it gives you more money yeah but but how would this ever help inflation well there was no inflation under Trump yeah
(42:20) because the economy and everything in the world was growing too right Co hadn't shut everything down yet but I'm saying that Donald Trump's Administration even his last month in
(42:25) office that was 1.4% Biden can't even get that in his best yeah but the are we are we GNA cite like
(42:31) the year of CO as like these are the well yeah I mean if you want to be preped to under covid the LA the last few months unemployment was terrible so
(42:38) if you wanted to go off that too but as soon as um the country opened back up they tried to take all this credit all
(42:43) these of all these jobs that were just bounce back sure and I wouldn't I think that's pretty stupid to say that we created this many jobs or whatever so I'm not giving them credit for that
(42:49) necessarily of course they would but I'm just saying when we look at just for inflation everything that Donald Trump talks about when he wants to come back
(42:55) on his next term seems like things it would just be INF he wants toar everything well he wants to drill more which will lower the price of everything
(43:00) we already a world producer in energy I don't know how much drilling more is going to help and but I mean he also want I don't even know how we'll have
(43:06) the people to drill because he wants to increase tariffs on every single product in the world well just stuff made out of
(43:11) America what which will benefit the America but if it's made out of America then what then who's going to be drilling when we're all busy like making
(43:16) clothes and making shoes and making the most basic fundamental products not all of us obviously stuff so come from overseas why he wants to terar all of it
(43:23) at 50 to 1,000% no he didn't say a th000 he said 100 he said he said a lot of numbers in that Bloomberg interview that
(43:29) he did yesterday I think he said a thousand for some of them but yeah he says he wants to he said he wants to tear everything he said 10 or 20% was
(43:35) too low he wants to manufacture everything at home and then when you uh when uh Harris went on The View and said would you do anything different uh than
(43:41) Biden she said no can't think of anything no matter how people are struggling struggling how the world is she can't think of one thing she would
(43:46) do well I mean the United States is ahead of the okay pause you've been voted out by the majority please return to your
(43:52) seat yeah
(44:08) [Applause] Jesus now Stephen that was very
(44:13) inflationary okay that was very high well hold on to be clear I'm not a huge fan of just like stimulus stuff because
(44:20) I think it has a lot of inflationary pressures I think for giving student loan debt I think would also be massively infation a lot of bad ways but none of those even come close to the E
(44:26) total economic destruction that would be r on this country with across the board Universal tariffs to every country in
(44:32) the world were you concerned by the tariffs in the first term yes okay why didn't we see the inflation in the first
(44:37) term under Trump over this under these tariffs that you're so concerned about because I think that raising prices and everything can kind of be massed through
(44:43) the allocation of money to other assets especially when the econom is growing so the world economy is growing right because a lot of people can buy things a
(44:49) lot of money can can transfer to a lot of different places uh inflation has to do with dollars chasing supplies of goods basically and if the supplies
(44:55) continue to grow at a really high rate you can probably afford more deficit spending but the issue is that I don't think that Donald Trump was
(45:00) intelligently saying like well I can probably afford a deficit spend here because of economy I think he just likes to spend spend spend because everybody
(45:06) does and I don't think that Trump would have the ability to re it in as he said multiple times in his Bloomberg interview yesterday but but also like
(45:12) the big event that was contributing to inflation over the Biden Administration was probably Co and a lot of the knock on stuff from Co American Rescue plan
(45:19) for example the unemployment rate had already been cut and half 100 million people had immunity to the VAC to the virus and yet we put2 trillion dollars
(45:25) of heroin into the economy the United States is also outperforming every single other G7 oecd country when
(45:31) it comes to metrics like inflation and how our economy is doing as well I think we probably made the right choice there right well Stephen I'll say wait wait
(45:36) would you say that we made the right choice for with like the American I I disagree I disagree so which country should we have acted like well I I'm
(45:42) going to hold ourselves to the American Standard which is to always to do the best thing and not to compare ourselves to others okay so we are outperforming
(45:48) everybody else but you think we should be doing even better okay Stephen if I'm the best alcoholic in the room I'm in
(45:53) the wrong room I don't want to be the best of the worst I want to be the best compared my own standard okay but to be clear you're talking about a world where
(46:00) every single person alcoholic I'm just saying that you're you're you're you're trying to point to an economic poliy you
(46:05) can't point to in any other country in the world and we measure milon relational to other countries and the fact that we hav interrupted you with
(46:12) all respect I haven't 8 and a half million people are working multiple jobs to keep up with inflation You've Got 7
(46:17) million Prime working age men who are not in the labor force 37% of Americans
(46:24) say that their children's life will not be better than theirs this economy is hurting a lot of people right now do you
(46:30) accept that no what's Donald Trump going to do to improve that economy well let's well let's talk about that for a moment
(46:36) let's let's just talk about that for a moment With all sincerity sure what problem does tariffs try to address
(46:41) Stephen um in Donald Trump's world or what that's a very general question objective speaking when you look at
(46:47) tariffs what does it try to solve for um tariffs can be led for a variety of different reasons the two most common
(46:52) reasons that are given is that one it can be foolishly employed to try to protect an industry so you would other
(46:58) people to make your own Industries more competive these require cross theard tffs not specific ones and then a second reason could be for issues relating to
(47:04) say like naal security so for instance I want to tear off these people's abilities to manufacture microchips are steel not because I think we'll be
(47:09) economically better off but because if we get into war with them I don't want to be relying on them for process I think the latter case makes a lot of sense by the way if you get to war with
(47:15) China now listen although I would be honest about the latter one to say we don't do it for economic reasons we do it for security reason that's fine that's absolutely fine and I agree with
(47:20) you on that does China have tariffs on us yes does Europe have tariffs on us yes it's not free trade when they're
(47:26) rigging it against us and charging us to send our products over there so the question is Stephen if they're putting
(47:32) tariffs on us hurting our workers hollowing out places from Middletown Ohio to parts of Appalachia why can't we
(47:39) put in place a deterrent that says look if you're going to rig the system against American workers we are going to
(47:44) level the playing field we got a real problem in this country by the way St you ask me a question you ask me
(47:51) a question whatever economic plan or whatever you're talking about using terrorist sure I'm fine with that whatever you're saying that was nothing to do with the Trump Administration what
(47:57) you're you're talking into AI War to tr BRS down or for some Eng negotiations bringi down to reenter trade agreements
(48:04) kind of When Donald Trump renegotiated NAFTA into the US Mexico Canada right but however but but you can't just say
(48:11) Donald trp the threat of terrs bring them to the talking about using tariffs to get more people to negotiate he wants
(48:17) to create an autarchy that's his goal do you acknowledge that Donald Trump wants us to manufacture everything at home that's all of his rhetoric do you
(48:22) acknowledge he doesn't say okay no no Stephen just one second yeah he wants us to employ the working men and women of
(48:29) this country to give them a fair shot we're losing 100,000 people to opioids every year we're losing 900 people empy
(48:36) we're already below we're already below what the employment should be we're already below 5% Stephen 7 million
(48:41) working age men are not in the labor force that's a great number I don't know what that number hold on do you acknowledge hold on stepen Stephen just
(48:47) one sec half of working age men who were not in the labor force are taking opioid painkillers every day the broken
(48:53) industrial policies of this country Sho that AR being made in China is going to imag get rid of that problem
(48:59) no no Sten this does New Balance make in America yes or no does New Balance make in America I don't know for the finally
(49:05) assembly maybe okay yes they do but here's the thing what's the point of that Stephen Stephen Stephen do you
(49:11) think that we can manufacture every single good we no I don't think so I don't think so what is the goal of a th000 or 500 or whatever 100 where are
(49:17) Tesla's made where are Tesla's made where's the bestselling car in America made in the world rather where is it made I don't when you say America on
(49:24) what do you mean by that every single part no the final assembly a large you understand that yesterday when Donald
(49:29) Trump was doing his interview with Bloomberg he made fun of that Donald Trump [ __ ] on companies like Tesla when he said we do the final assembly here we
(49:35) could have children do that it's just throwing together Legos Donald Trump doesn't like final assembly Donald Trump wants not just the Tesla final assembly
(49:41) here but all the batteries all the steal every single component of that made in America again your plan sounds great
(49:46) that sounds like an ordinary like decent economic plan Donald Trump's plan is autarchy it's ridiculous I'm glad you
(49:51) like my plan thanks okay I if you run for president I'll support it I appreciate it
(50:01) Stephen hi hey y all right so if Trump is going to be bad for inflation why is
(50:08) it that when he left office in 2021 inflation was at like almost an alltime
(50:14) low practically non-existent at 1.4% as soon as he left that's when inflation started Rising with the Biden Harris
(50:19) Administration um if he's going to be bad at inflation why was the economy so good his whole four years um if you look
(50:25) at all the polls from any news site even CNN which is more left leaning you'll see that um people all people in general
(50:32) say that they trust Trump more with the did Donald Trump do that made the economy so good in the last four years
(50:37) the question should be what did he not do he didn't do anything exactly I agree he didn't do anything he didn't do
(50:43) anything badti do the economy had been growing ever since Obama had brought us out of the the end of the 2007 collapse
(50:50) again another Democrat president comes in whether it's 2008 with Obama inheriting the housing crisis or whether it's 20 20 with Biden coming and having
(50:57) to do with Co yeah he had to come in and spend like crazy you can't blame everything on Co okay uh blame a lot on Co it was a really big deal and we are
(51:03) doing better than all the other countries right now I agree under Biden that's true yes yeah and when Trump left office he was also in the middle of Co 2
(51:09) and inflation was still at 1.4% why has it tripled Donald Trump SP like the first year of Co or the first like month
(51:15) of Co pretending it didn't exist I don't know if he was like the leader to point to about that okay well I just don't know like what is what like what's one
(51:21) policy that Donald Trump has given if he comes back into office is going to help inflation just one he's going to be doing tariffs and he's that makes things
(51:27) more expensive also going to be pause you've been voted out by the majority please return to your seat
(51:40) yep hi hi nice to meet you nice meet you okay so the Congressional budget office
(51:46) in the 1980s reported that 1 to three billion M billion dollars was spent on illegal
(51:53) immigrants who were coming in and basically feeding off of Public Services so what I don't really find appealing is
(52:01) that you get a lot of conversation from the right and the left asking basically everyone except Latinos what they think
(52:07) about this issue okay because it affects us it affects the fact that we're here
(52:13) we've crossed legally and then we're getting our image basically affected by
(52:18) the fact that we have criminals killing Americans by the way let me just give you a few names who have died basically
(52:25) at hands of illegal criminals Lincoln Riley which people know Christopher Gad
(52:31) Travis wolf Alex what do you not care about these names no I don't care about these names oh you don't oh I'm good
(52:38) well that's if we're having a policy discussion no do do you want me to start naming off like every black person that
(52:44) gets killed by police offic or whatever you want to do the BLM tactics I mean we can do that but like no I don't care a 12-year-old Travis Scott a baby by two
(52:51) years old all all death all murder is but what is the you have a son right nothing so if your son was killed at the
(52:58) hands of an illegal immigrant who was a criminal you would care about the sou I would also care if he was killed by a 15
(53:03) I would kill if he I would care if he di a school shoo you mean what's the point wouldn't you be there advocating for the
(53:09) southern border to be closed you would be you think that my son High chance killed in a school shooting or by ille
(53:14) imant so you don't want to answer the question IM if your son was killed as a victim of at the hands of an illegal
(53:20) Criminal by the way there is a hit there there is a watch list of many people
(53:25) terrorist groups in organizations that have been coming into our country and it is very well known look let me tell you
(53:34) okay okay I'm sorry you've been voted out by the majority oh [Applause]
(53:45) okay so as everybody's already discussed um tariffs are actually beneficial to
(53:52) American manufacturing Ivanka Trump bought brought Louis Vuitton manufacturing back to America something
(53:59) that was considered unheard of why do you think every single Economist hates tariffs why do you think why do you hate
(54:05) American manufacturing I hate America I don't know what what what kind of a question no do you because a man
(54:10) manufacturing jobs actually bring people out of poverty so what is your problem with Manufacturing in America my problem
(54:16) is in America because we're such an educated country and because we're such an advanced country we can do more with our manufacturing than making the most
(54:23) barebones things that other countries might be better suited towards creating so the reason why El musk came to
(54:29) America doing our manufacturing to do baser manufacturing we can do more we can do we can do more saying that the
(54:35) lowest rung of our population isn't important enough to actually provide them a job even if it is a manufacturing
(54:40) job they have jobs what is the jobs the ones that are being taken by the we have less than 5% unemployment what are they
(54:46) doing for taken by the immigrants because I thought the immigrants were coming here not working
(54:57) not very well something about the policies affecting you I don't know what yeah my community is the one who's going to be affected by the policies that are
(55:03) are what are you talking what Poli CA Harris's policies and Trump's policies we benefited my community benefited what
(55:09) from what policy what are you talk because when you bring in an unskilled labor population they're going to compete with Americans who are also low
(55:15) skill workers are do you think that we have an employment you think think I can't pick
(55:22) you don't think I can't teach Maria or Juanita to pick up a pair of scissors and room a dog's hair cuz I've done that
(55:28) before and you know what I can replace anybody that's called being a low skill worker and anybody crossing the border
(55:34) can do that you don't need a degree you don't need a a diploma to do these jobs jobs America does not have the most
(55:41) productive Labor jur job you don't think these low skill jobs are important you don't think these
(55:47) low skill jobs are important that's very sad the unit States more in the United
(55:52) States than just base manufacturing we we are the world's most sophisticated economy why should more don't have 50
(56:00) hours in the day you can do more than that why wouldn't we let other countries do manufacturers choose to go out of the
(56:06) country is because America has to pay for things like labor laws Employment Insurance all these other facets that's
(56:12) why these big corporations will go to places like China I have a company called byd in my backyard that brings in
(56:18) Chinese immigrants and pays them Chinese wages in America and my representative Mike Garcia got that that organization
(56:26) defunded because with Federal funding my taxes Chinese company in my backyard I
(56:33) would rather pay American workers $2 an hour to make products may maybe your company shouldn't exist in America maybe
(56:38) should go to China and make your company go to China and make the company that would be better you should I'm arguing
(56:44) that American workers can earn more money than you are very sad you don't love America you are proving don't want
(56:51) America because you don't want Americans to benefit you don't want American manufacturing to to lift people out of
(56:57) poverty that is [Applause]
(57:08) sad he what's up nice to meet you um so we already talked about inflation 1.9 under Trump uh I think you guys like to
(57:14) leave out deficit spending which was 8.2 trillion under Biden and 6.7 under Trump
(57:19) why was it so much higher under Biden um you could say during covid but you could also bring in the tax uh the total
(57:25) revenue during uh Biden and Trump was close to the same and he was spending almost double the amount each year you
(57:31) could also talk about trp running such huge deficits question can you repeat the
(57:36) question Donald why did yeah because you want to Gish the next Point why did Donald Trump engage in massive deficit
(57:42) spending why did Donald Trump engage in massive D spending um I don't know the answer that
(57:47) can you answer it yeah because he likes to spend because it makes the economy look better okay so the same thing that Biden Harris does they re because
(57:54) they're coming in under an inreasing rate to Stave off recession okay then what about the Federal Reserve printing $6 trillion in two years what about the
(58:02) federal reserveer monetary Poli my point is you like to blame inflation only on Co but
(58:08) you don't want to take in deficit spending you don't want to take in the Federal Reserve printing money you also don't want if you want to talk about the Federal Reserve the Federal Reserve
(58:14) rates were not only low under Trump he pressured them to be low he literally bragged about it in his interview and he said that when he comes back in one of
(58:19) his goals is to keep the federal interest rates low he talked about bringing Jerome pal into his office and threatening him to keep the rates low so
(58:25) if you don't like def defit spending if you don't like the Federal Reserves monetary policy if you don't like free money then it feels like Donald Trump is
(58:30) literally the worst case for you well would you say the deficit spending is causing inflation so doesn't that take
(58:36) more money away from Americans by your logic I don't know if it takes more money away fromer but deficit spending can so on higher inflation doesn't take
(58:42) money away from Americans it it can it's more complicated than that but yeah it can but I'm saying that deficit spending
(58:47) in and of itself is generally inflationary there are reasons why you might want a deficit spend for instance it's better to have some inflation than
(58:52) it is to have a recession or full depression right okay yeah I'll agree with that now you bring up tariffs now why did we extend them under uh Biden
(59:00) and then why do we double the tariffs from Canada as well if tariffs are so bad so when Biden does it it's okay but when uh Trump installs them they're
(59:06) horrible so the issue is if you're talking about specific tariffs as retaliation uh because somebody else might be taring something that they
(59:12) shouldn't if they're engaging in that then that type of thing as was discussed earlier I think it's okay the reason why a lot of them came in under Trump and
(59:18) they weren't resend it under Biden is because once somebody's put a tariff in place and then a counter tariff comes up you have to engage in a negotiation to
(59:23) bring them down you can't take yours down unilaterally because you just so do you think all economists agree that 10% tariff is bad yes you should look at a
(59:29) study 2019 by Jenny Tang Brent Newman never look at a single stud increase in
(59:34) inflate or that's time please return to your seat my next claim is Donald Trump is a
() 
(59:48) fascist hello Andrew hello Destiny Destiny can you define fascism um I
(59:54) would say the two big points for FAS ISM would be ultra nationalism and authoritarianism okay what is
(1:00:00) authoritarianism I would say that authoritarianism is trying to centralize as much power in like a structural sense
(1:00:06) into one part of the government and then in a broader sense it usually means undermining a bunch of liberal values that you would find like saying so then
(1:00:12) how is it that every part of the government which Acres more and more power to itself every single year aren't a bunch of fascist because the
(1:00:19) government gaining power doesn't necessarily make it fascist you could say there might be governmental overreach I'm still not even sure what is fascist here Destiny what is
(1:00:27) giovanti we have definitions of what fascism is we have thir parist who are out there right now who are Fascist they
(1:00:34) claim Trump is a populist can you tell me why they're wrong and why you're right that he's a fascist I would have to know their exact reasons for why they
(1:00:40) reject Trump being a fascist but I would say the Trump is fascist he's an ultra nationalist these are your claims I'm
(1:00:46) not claiming anything that those people said I've you my definition for fascist I gave the two parts I can explain let's start with ultra authoritarian why I
(1:00:52) said uh Ultra Nationalist and authoritarian what is ultra nationalism so I think Ultra nationalism is when you
(1:00:57) engage in a hardcore protectionist ideology that usually involves shutting yourself out from the rest of the world
(1:01:03) that could be in forms of um International Affairs like military conflicts and it could be in the forms of ultra protectionist in terms of trade
(1:01:09) and shutting down um things like immigration in order to protect your own native peoples oftentimes there a heavy heavily racialized element but that
(1:01:15) might not have to be okay well Donald Trump you're not saying has heavy racialized element are you um I'm
(1:01:21) ambivalent I don't really care on that much I think that he qualifies or satisfies the term without that but okay so let's dive into this real quick uh if
(1:01:27) you have a president who doesn't want to get involved in foreign affairs as far as Wars go and has some type of policies
(1:01:33) which benefit the United States over all of the Nations is he a fascist no well I'm still confused as to what makes
(1:01:39) Trump a fascist that's because I had two parts of that and you missed the authoritarian one you described there before was just like protection when you
(1:01:45) said authoritarian what is he doing which is accumulating all power to himself so he's trying to centralized
(1:01:50) power in the executive branch of the government and specifically in the presidential part of the government of the executive branch how
(1:01:56) um how Donald Trump thinks that he should be able to unilaterally make decisions up and down all of the different departments and offices that
(1:02:02) exist in the executive branch presidents use executive orders all the time presidents presidents unilaterally make
(1:02:08) decisions all the time they don't yes they do they do they use executive orders all the time an executive order
(1:02:14) doesn't mean that you are taking power away from the Departments and offices that have been created right so where's the fascism here would you like me to
(1:02:20) give you specific examples give me the specific examples sure so when Donald Trump didn't like the answer that he was getting from his attorney general
(1:02:25) because he was trying to direct the Department of Justice to do investigations or to fabricate claims that would be an example of trying to
(1:02:31) centralize power just to the president because he's undermining his own Department that's been created for him that's tasked that's supposed to have
(1:02:36) some level of Independence that's tasked with doing investigations let me ask you a question is the president of the United States commander and chief the of
(1:02:42) the Armed Forces of the United States I believe so you believe so unless something's changed do they have do they have control of the entire military
(1:02:49) apparatus essentially as the commander commanderin-chief yes yeah is that fascist I no so they have have
(1:02:56) unilateral basically almost unilateral control by your own metrics of the most
(1:03:01) Mighty military on planet Earth that's not accumulating enough power centralized control to one person it's
(1:03:07) the fact that he tried to slay someing electors really so the president being the Commander in the chief is specifically laid out in the
(1:03:13) Constitution that's an authority granted to him um I don't know what's fascist about because you said it's ultra power
(1:03:19) it's this idea of of you have Central Power never bring
(1:03:24) that up for him but if you have the central power yeah of the most Mighty military on planet Earth and the codes
(1:03:31) to the largest sneaker Armament on planet Earth you already have all of the central power bro really yeah what how
(1:03:39) do the nuclear codes help you direct your Department of Justice you okay I'm sorry does he is he the commander and chief of the of the United States armed
(1:03:45) forces are you just arguing that he's the commander I already agree with you I don't know why you ARG I'm arguing to you is I'm asking you how does the
(1:03:50) commander-in chief use the military ask it's your claim ask claim your claim is
(1:03:57) how does that make him control the doj how how does the military help him control thej back up that is the most powerful position I can think of for you
(1:04:03) to be in Period How Could You position what more accumulation of power would
(1:04:09) you want for a fascist dictator okay so that's powerful in that you controll the military that's it that's just control
(1:04:15) of the military for the FBI coming to your house to arrest you for the doj filing charges the military TOA no the
(1:04:20) president doesn't do that I don't know no I don't believe that he can I don't believe you can I don't think that you can deploy the military to arbitrarily
(1:04:26) arrest US citizens you've been voted out by the majority please return to your [Applause]
(1:04:41) seat I okay you're not voting for Trump no I
(1:04:47) am I think we can have a respectful policy disagreement without labeling one side or the other fascist or communist
(1:04:53) or Marxist so let's have a policy disagreement here you think Donald Trump is a fascist because of ultra
(1:04:59) nationalist Tendencies and authoritarianism correct yeah so let me just draft this vision and see if it
(1:05:05) makes sense the authoritarianism is ruling by Presidential decree Prosecuting political opponents bringing
(1:05:12) power into the government and abandoning our allies abroad that sounds a lot like the Biden Harris
(1:05:19) Administration I would say that no no wait we'll go Point by point so first of all when we talk about abandoning allies
(1:05:25) abroad are we referring to so we haven't cut funding from Israel are we referring to when Donald Trump abandoned the
(1:05:31) Turkish people or abandoned the Kurdish people to Turkish attacks in Syria um are we talking about when the Trump
(1:05:37) Administration cut out the Afghanistan government in the Doha Accords when they were talking with the Taliban when When Donald Trump surrender to the Taliban or
(1:05:43) are we talking about when Biden tried to support Ukraine with the full force of not only the United States economy and
(1:05:48) our and our moral support but also by getting Europe on board to help Ukraine the idea that the Biden and Harris Administration have abandoned our
(1:05:53) foreign Partners is nonsense to me um and also it's not just about making the government more powerful I know that Andrew tried to run with that it's not
(1:05:59) it's about centralizing power within the government right and wiping off student loan debts at the expense of working-class Americans I understand
(1:06:06) that but let's so hold on wiping out student loan government the citation for that was the uh was a bill that was passed from Congress Biden tried to do
(1:06:12) that because of the that during it was like extraordinary times you could do something and he tried to stretch it to that but the Supreme Court Supreme Court
(1:06:18) said no and then he didn't do it okay Supreme Court had to intervene right well they the Supreme Court made a ruling on it because it was challenged
(1:06:24) that's the government like working as and and he stopped trying to do that right afterward right he said I'm not going to do this anymore or did he say I'm going to keep delivering on this
(1:06:30) promise I think he exploited other legal Avenues to do it okay well legal remains to be seen but let's talk about he
(1:06:36) hasn't done anything illegal right okay let's talk about he hasn't done anything illegal right we're talking about okay there's no answer to that okay let's
(1:06:42) let's talk about let's talk about October 7th October 7th would not have
(1:06:47) happened if president Trump was in office Ukraine would not have been invaded by Russia if president Trump was
(1:06:52) in office you can call him crazy you can call him anything he was in effective deterrent because he understood Steven a
(1:06:58) little thing we like to call peace through strength here's the truth the truth is October 7th probably happened
(1:07:03) likely because of trump and his policies why is holy moly why is that why is that reason why is because Donald Trump
(1:07:10) engaged in more Reckless Behavior with Israel that only encouraged Israel's expansionism without doing anything to actually address the Palestinian problem
(1:07:16) for instance um Donald Trump agreed to moving and recognizing the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem um that instigated
(1:07:22) everybody in the region uh including the Palestinians which is why you saw the whole border rights the great marcher that erupted over the year protesting
(1:07:28) that and then Donald Trump along with Kushner tried to help Israelis uh negotiate multilateral peace agreements
(1:07:34) or or more bilateral peace agreements with the Abraham Accords again while cutting out the Palestinians all of this
(1:07:39) just continued to drive the Palestinian plight further and further because they saw more and more allies being isolated from them they saw no recognition out
(1:07:45) from the United States and then obviously you know terrorist attacks is all you can do from that point apparently so so so Trump moved an
(1:07:52) embassy got Muslim majority countries for the first time ever to re recogniz the rightful existence of the Jewish
(1:07:57) state of Israel and that justifies the heinous attack we saw on October 7th where we killed over 1 justifi anything
(1:08:05) you said that Trump was respons Donald Trump and his foreign policy posturing is what moved us in
(1:08:11) that direction President Biden was in office for three years before October 7th happened how possibly could that be
(1:08:17) trans what did Biden do to contribute to the conditions that made October 7th happen very clear very clear Iran was
(1:08:24) only exporting 100 50,000 barrels of oil a day under Trump now they're exporting
(1:08:29) 1.6 million they're making hundreds of billions of dollars a year more that
(1:08:34) emboldens them to give their proxies weapons money and the Vigor to attack
(1:08:40) the Jewish State and that is unacceptable in the International Community let me tell you something about pres think only reason that Hamas
(1:08:47) attacked Israel you think the only reason they be able to do is because of increased Iranian funding who funds Hamas in part it's Iran but Hamas gets
(1:08:53) funding from all sorts of different Adventures who funds Iran they were getting they they get money from qar right who funds okay who FS Hamas of
(1:09:00) course they do proba more money no no no it might have been qar I think actually well they give him a Ritz Carlton Hotel
(1:09:06) room but listen no they were transferring a whole lot of money to the Gaza Strip that was one of the big things the one of the big scandals that
(1:09:11) nyaho was involved in was allowing that money to pass through to the Gaza Strip let do some quick logical reasoning here
(1:09:16) if Iran gets more money that's good for Hamas right you agree on that come on broadly speaking broadly speaking yeah
(1:09:22) come on just just concede one thing Stephen come on uh Broad speaking probably yeah okay all right there's
(1:09:28) more that at play here that I'm not even sure if you're aware of so the irgc the the Iranian revolutionary guard Corps has some amount of money that's
(1:09:33) guaranteed to regardless of what they're exporting importing as a country and they but General I agree with you sure yeah and you know what I am glad that
(1:09:39) President Trump ordered the assassination of kasum solomani because that man is responsible for death and
(1:09:44) destruction the targets he made on the Jewish state were completely unacceptable Ste I don't think the target made on American citizens in Iraq
(1:09:51) was unacceptable I have no love loss for Silman I'm glad the dude's dead I'm not going to say her defend it but Donald Trump doesn't do anything good foreign
(1:09:57) policy wise for Israel it doesn't have a vision for the region that's why he had to basically leave all of it to his son-in-law Kushner why but why was
(1:10:03) Crimea annexed under Obama why was Ukraine invaded under Biden why did nothing happen under Trump for four
(1:10:10) years it was a complete stalemate complete stability wait Crimea was still occupied right okay but it was annexed
(1:10:16) under who hold on it was still occupied right of course there was there was a
(1:10:21) civil war that was raging in the dabas the entire time right accelerate did it accelerate was there new land claims
(1:10:27) there was more not new land claims but the the Civil War in the being bombed bom but the Civil War in the Don boss
(1:10:33) was still going on what did Donald Trump do about that world is safer under President Trump World was safer under
(1:10:38) President Trump the world knows that stepen and the world's going to show that on November 5th
(1:10:45) [Applause]
(1:10:52) okay so would you attribute um fascism to may be a
(1:10:57) dictator I mean a dictator can be fascistic sure okay so on Biden's first
(1:11:03) day in office he signed 17 executive orders Trump signed one most of the executive orders that Biden signed were
(1:11:08) to Halt like the border and other Trump immigration policies I don't think executive orders have anything to do
(1:11:14) with Fascism do would you attribute those to being a dictator no not at all no okay
(1:11:22) well then what other claim do you have uh that he is a fascist compared to I think that Donald Trump reaching into and trying to direct his Apartments to
(1:11:28) do probably illegal things well Biden did that too with Facebook he came out and said uh Zuckerberg came out and said
(1:11:35) that Biden Harris came to him to uh to pretty much limit of what Trump I don't
(1:11:40) think that was the claim I think that what Zuckerberg said was that he felt pressured by some of the intelligence agencies to censor stories that they had
(1:11:46) censored and he felt like he regretted that or he laptop for example well the that was
(1:11:52) that wasn't done because of any direct pressure from any of the intelligence agencies we saw that in the Twitter files there was never a claim that well
(1:11:57) then why would Zuckerberg come out and say I'm not going to well I'm talking the Twitter files Zuckerberg had his reasons that he listed in his letter to
(1:12:03) Jordan but none of this was illegal well I'm not saying it's illegal but I'm saying would you not say that's kind of dictatorial kind of fasc no I don't
(1:12:09) think so it's all like out in the open like at the end of the year like Twitter and Facebook are publishing like how much they're Char the world were reversed and then Trump did that to
(1:12:15) Biden would you then call him the fascist for doing that for doing what for pressuring as you said Zuckerberg or
(1:12:21) meta to limit um if Donald Trump's intelligence it felt like there was like information that was being illegally
(1:12:28) offered into the United States from foreign enemies or whatever and thatment the laptop was Pro no but that was the
(1:12:33) word the last Prov to be anything but that was the fear and that was the like fear that they had shared with those companies they didn't force them
(1:12:38) directly to take any action again we can read the Twitter files we can go through the emails I'm not talking about Twitter I'm talking about Facebook I'm talking about Med for Facebook Zuckerberg also
(1:12:44) didn't allege any illegal action he just said there was pressure from some of the agencies because to like censor what they perceived to be as threats or
(1:12:49) misinformation or whatever I think I think some of it had to do like Co misinformation and [ __ ] as well I think okay which we can argue like should they
(1:12:55) have the RO to do that or not I just don't know if that's necessarily fascistic like Donald Trump trying to direct his doj to like go after certain
(1:13:01) people or trying to direct his doj to like then that with all the there's zero evidence for any of that and probably
(1:13:06) it's almost certainly not true if you look at how mer Garland has gone after for instance his son okay pause you've been voted out by the majority please
(1:13:12) return to your [Applause]
(1:13:18) seat hi hi I'm Tia nice to meet you nice to meet you so I wanted to hone in on
(1:13:23) the part about National ISM can you explain that again in a little bit more detail sure so I would say more Ultra
(1:13:29) nationalism than just nationalism but it's this idea that you know basically screw the rest of the world we're going
(1:13:35) to hardcore cut immigration we're going to hardcore cut our trade we're going to hardcore cut our associate with anybody else and we're just going to be like our
(1:13:40) own little basically island nation I think is a it's a very bad direction to go in and who's taking us in that
(1:13:46) direction I think that's what Donald Trump wants to do wants to do he was in office for four years did he do that uh
(1:13:51) well Donald Trump um began some tariff processes he had uh he tried to do a full Muslim he tried well he took steps
(1:13:58) towards that he took steps towards that right you acknowledge that he did try he banned seven majority countries right us did do that he did do terrorist he
(1:14:04) acknowledged that right are you glad to be able to live here am I I'm glad to be able to live
(1:14:09) here am I glad to be an American I am but I I don't know what that means to you but to me I which is interesting
(1:14:15) because something that I've started to realize in the last few years is people who love America who love living here
(1:14:21) have been titled nationalists and it's like a threat all of a sudden people that label themselves mag that say they love America have nothing to do with
(1:14:26) American values and nothing in common with the core values of this country so they're the least American people please explain sure the desire to elect
(1:14:34) somebody who says the most obviously fishous things in the world like the media is the enemy of the people a guy who says he wants to terminate the
(1:14:40) Constitution a guy who says he'd be a dictator on day one the Donald Trump said that he believes he could terminate the Constitution because of it's so
(1:14:46) crazy because I've been hearing a lot lately from your side that the constitution isn't necessary oh I'm
(1:14:51) sorry which lawmaker or presidential candidate said that your side which is
(1:14:56) that the name first and last your side like Miss side or is is she a congressman or is she a senator or I
(1:15:02) don't know which leader has said that so I can't speak to that I don't know who you follow but anyway you acknowledge Donald
(1:15:07) Trump said that in times of like great Peril you can suspend the Constitution and that he would do that for voter fraud for voter fraud he said that yes
(1:15:15) on Truth social he said that I'm sure there's a longer quote that I can look up later I would love to do that but I'm
(1:15:20) sure you're using it out of context okay you'll look it up later and you won't never talk about again because it's important quote you acknowled Donald TR
(1:15:26) so well because you're on that side I know okay um you agree that Donald Trump said that he would be a dictator on day
(1:15:32) one he did not say he would be a dictator on day one okay okay cool so as
(1:15:37) an American I believe that it's a privilege and a blessing to live here and under the bid Biden and Harris
(1:15:44) Administration my life has gotten a lot worse and a lot more difficult has your life gotten better or has it gotten worse i' say my life has gotten better
(1:15:51) well you're congratulations you're the only person person in this room maybe but when I go to the grocery store and you
(1:15:58) mentioned about inflation and everything but when I go to the grocery store and a bag of groceries is like $50 and I have two kids to feed do you think that that
(1:16:04) helps me as an American or do you think that hurts me as an American I think an expansion of the T child tax credit would help you a lot more than another
(1:16:10) tax cut for wealthy billionaires a couple thousand doll isn't going to change my life especially with another $6,000 a year wouldn't help you all with
(1:16:17) groceries with two children yeah this much maybe but if the price children
(1:16:24) eating okay pause you've been voted out by the majority please return your seat
(1:16:36) nice hi hi nice to meet you Chrissy so I would like to address because earlier I
(1:16:41) feel like this was kind of dodged on a little bit earlier you directly said
(1:16:46) that Trump was authoritarian then you said he was Ultra Nationalist and then you said he was authoritarian then you said he was internationalist again you
(1:16:51) kind of bounce back and forth so which do you think both he's both right both right but then when he uh the topic of
(1:16:58) ultr nationalism brought up you said well he's more authoritarian and then that again changed to well he's more Ultra nationalist so which in your mind
(1:17:05) is he is he more authoritarian or is he more Ultra nationalist I don't know how to answer it's like asking if a square is more
(1:17:11) blue or 5T well because you said because you said that he was more Nationalist
(1:17:17) and then you said he was more authoritarian you said both claims so I want to know which claim is is he more
(1:17:22) nationalist or is he more authoritarian I don't know how to say is's more of he's both they're not I don't think I ever said that I don't remember do you
(1:17:29) remember was response to I believe it was first gentleman who spoke okay I he might have said something like you said
(1:17:34) that he was an alter National I said yes and just being one of these things doesn't have to be a why is nationalism
(1:17:39) at all even bad in the first place um I don't know if nationalism is necessarily bad um I think that people kind of swap
(1:17:45) it out with patriotism sometimes that's why there's the prefix Ultra nationalism Ultra nationalism is bad is because when you elevate your own country just like
(1:17:50) what do he do for Al nationalism when he talks about putting terrorists across the board for every single other country on the planet so helping our country not
(1:17:59) it's not would helping us he was not helping our economy during his presidency when he was actually literally getting us to import rice to
(1:18:06) China Rice to China is benefiting our economy is that not is replacing China
(1:18:12) as one of big China's biggest farming with ours and as this gentleman also brought up with our manufacturing how is
(1:18:19) bringing manufacturing over here which is helped by tariffs how is that not we already we already manfacture things
(1:18:25) here if we've got more people manufacturing Bas Goods we can't manufacture more sophisticated Goods there's a reason mus because you only
(1:18:32) have so many people okay pause that's time please return to your
(1:18:39) chair my next claim is the make America great again movement would not exist without massive amounts of
() 
(1:18:51) [Music] disinformation hello J hi fancy seeing you here again yep here
(1:18:58) to bully me some more yep all right let's go okay let's get it going can you state some of the disinformation sure I
(1:19:04) think over the past few weeks we've seen absurd claims relating to hurricanes being manufactured by weather machines
(1:19:10) we've seen outright lies about uh the National Guard and FEMA lot like blowing
(1:19:15) away supplies and trapping people in their homes and lying about Biden providing U financial aid to States even
(1:19:20) though Trump is the one that has threatened to withhold Aid we've seen lives about the Haitians eating dog dogs and cats and um springf I can go on it
(1:19:27) have you have you um I have a few questions have you left the United States yeah where have you been um I've
(1:19:34) been through Israel and Palestine I've gone across Europe I've been to New Zealand I've been to place in Asia I don't know what okay so you're like me
(1:19:40) you've been everywhere so you've seen some of these claims you've like literally seen them to be true are that
(1:19:47) they're false rather so I mean I haven't seen how hurricane is made I haven't talked to every Haitian in Springfield
(1:19:53) so all right so what was the second point you brought up um what about you
(1:19:58) said something about the the camps and not not looking that way that was my point have you been to these camps and
(1:20:03) have you seen the conditions and things that the FEMA camps no yeah so yeah
(1:20:09) exactly period the end so you're you're saying no you haven't but you're saying it's disinformation so how do you know
(1:20:16) that it's disinformation which is why I brought up the point have you left the country have you seen with your own eyes
(1:20:22) what's going on in these camps and the do you understand that for any type of society in an advanced civilization to
(1:20:28) work you have to be able to rely on third party people to report to you things that are true right but there's so much fake news out there today
(1:20:33) exactly so my question is to you though is that have you seen these claims have you seen these places with your own eyes
(1:20:39) do you know what's going on no but I don't have time verify everything with my own eyes I know because you're too busy teaching Gamers how to be because I
(1:20:45) can't verify every single thing in the world with my own eyes just like you couldn't verify the fact that you you
(1:20:51) enjoy getting pegged right actually you did verify anyways but that was just a technically you need a mirror to see that but I
(1:20:57) don't know why it even a b are we here to talk sex for 20 minutes we can do that if you want yeah so what other what
(1:21:03) other claims were like not valid or false the I how many I mean how many you
(1:21:10) want I mean the election the 2020 election the voter fraud claims for that were all fabricated you've been voted out by the majority please return to
(1:21:17) your
(1:21:23) seats I think that both sides thrive on misinformation I think average people don't have enough times in time in their
(1:21:28) lives to decipher what's true and what's not I think that's the case for most people who worked 9 to5 unfortunately uh
(1:21:34) but I think that your side also thrives off of misinformation I think that you actually just did the meme a second ago
(1:21:40) you said that the tax cuts and jobs Act was just tax cuts for the rich but uh in fact people making 15,000 to $50,000
(1:21:46) received a tax cut of 16 to 26% majority of the money went to wealthy people that why is that it's because wealthy people
(1:21:51) pay more taxes Stephen yeah so their their share of tax burden is obviously going to be in volume more physical
(1:21:57) dollars but when it comes to the budget all that matters do you can see that proportionally middle class people
(1:22:02) received more in tax breaks than rich people proportionally proportionally to their income yes possibly or their tax
(1:22:08) burden but but the problem is the effect at the end of the day on the budget then is going to be out like the biggest outlay is going to be towards wealthy
(1:22:14) people right our our deficits are increasing because all the money that wealthy people are saving right okay sure that fair enough but I think like
(1:22:20) already uh what is 90% of taxes are paid by 50% of the country and 50% of taxes are paid by 1% of the country I always
(1:22:27) hear this thing of like uh the billionaires the rich people aren't paying their fair share but it seems to me that they've been paying more than their fair share since America's
(1:22:33) Inception and the middle class actually has been paying uh not their fair share and I'm not saying that we should increase taxes on the middle class but
(1:22:39) what I'm saying is the billionares are definitely paying their fair share they pay a lot for sure but I if you want to fund all the programs that we have you
(1:22:45) have to tax more back to the misinfo thing I mean like I agree that both sides engage in misinformation I just think that conservatives do it on a
(1:22:50) whole other level Donald Trump will get up and lie as easily as he breathes like if you watch any of the interv he gives
(1:22:55) lie after lie after lie Li close to the same not there's a reason why they asked Tim Walls did you
(1:23:01) lie like were you three months off on when you went to China he fust for Vance it was do you believe the results of the
(1:23:07) last election yeah no I agree these are totally different constantly tting like saying
(1:23:15) inflation is lower now than it was under Trump pre-co inflation rate 2.4% [Music]
(1:23:27) I had to run for that one why did Biden say he ran for
(1:23:33) president I don't remember you do you remember the video he released at the beginning when he launched his campaign
(1:23:39) for the 2020 election or for the uh I don't remember now he Sals because of Charlottesville and he specifically
(1:23:45) cited that Donald Trump called the Nazis fine people do you believe that so yes I
(1:23:52) don't know why I'm sorry wait I understand what you're going to say I know what you're going to say it's people like to go to the so some people
(1:23:58) present this as Donald Trump saying that the Nazis were good people he didn't he said there were good people on both sides of that rally but it was a rally
(1:24:05) that had Nazis I don't know in what world you would ever say that the full quote doesn't exculpatory at all there
(1:24:12) the full quote he said uh the Nazis and white supremacist I completely disavow
(1:24:17) so he he disavow them after he was pushed several times to do so no no that's not true he no he said in the
(1:24:22) speech he said it in the speech he said it in the speech and they took him out of context and said that he he called
(1:24:28) them fine people right after he said the fine people line he said I disavow the Nazis so that's a lie that the buying
(1:24:34) campaign I disagree that it was a lie his quot on its own of him saying that people on both sides and a tiki tally on
(1:24:40) a t Tor rally that is insanity Insanity it's really easy this
(1:24:46) was like a question on a on a [ __ ] test saying like Hey listen here's a rally with a bunch of guy sorry my bad
(1:24:51) scamer language my bad streamer language there's a rally and on one side you got a bunch of people tiki torches how would
(1:24:57) you describe the rally and you go well there are there are fine people on both sides it's the most easy bait in the world to say you probably should just
(1:25:03) say that side is a bad side AB considering how much people claim that like you have to just out all the BLM
(1:25:08) all all protest over the removal of the Confederate statues there were people there were normal people there people
(1:25:14) there with tiki torches that was at the night for that's irant because he he disavowed the Nazis you've been voted
(1:25:19) out please return to your seat
(1:25:27) what's up Stephen hey what's up so um tell me misinformation you mean like
(1:25:32) fake dossier or like rhetoric that has a president get assassinated attempts to get
(1:25:38) assassinated you mean like that kind of misinformation that cause three assassination attempts do you know why
(1:25:45) those people try those assassination attempts do we even I don't know you're you're your friends right didn't you say like one of the Republicans that she got
(1:25:50) got shot right you have no problem with so I mean level weren't two of them like registered Republicans so they say I
(1:25:57) think weren watching your content were they were they watching my content that's what they said I who's they they
(1:26:03) the je or I don't know about that isn't that the same isn't that the same misinformation the dossier the rhetoric
(1:26:09) that he's a bad ruin the country oh you know like the one that Hillary Clinton bought right you know the one that was published by buia the fake one you know
(1:26:16) the one that whole that whole FBA FBI you know investigation that wasted a whole bunch of Americans money right
(1:26:22) well no I don't think I would say I think that the Muller invation turned out more credible indictments and information than the Hillary Clinton
(1:26:27) email investigation than the whole Benghazi waste of time that that that came from you know
(1:26:34) the Democrat Party all that fake news right is that what you're talking about when I don't know if you call it fake
(1:26:39) news it was a dossier that they paid for to be researched by person I me said there was low confidence in a lot of it
(1:26:44) just like for instance you acknowledge it all about Hunter Biden and his illegal dealings with barisma and Joe Biden like profiting all that that's all
(1:26:50) fake news too I know I just know he does a lot of cocaine okay did you go cocaine came with them no I don't you [ __ ] with
(1:26:55) them not recently no cuz you are the Kumer Gremlin right am I the [ __ ] gin well we know you are yeah like Donald
(1:27:01) Trump is when he was like a prostitute like four years or four months after his wife had a child at home when he was
(1:27:06) cheating with Stormy Daniels you mean like how you take your wife to go get banged out president am I running for president right now are you going to
(1:27:12) vote for me or vote for you remember so do do you remember when Donald Trump Wasing Stormy Daniels do you
(1:27:17) remember four months after four months after she had a child remember remember that you notice that remember that I
(1:27:22) like that the standard that you set for me name as he said for your president I'm not running for president you understand my standard for president okay well then why are you comparing
(1:27:28) Trump to me because I'm just been voted out by the majority please return to your
(1:27:42) seat okay so everybody seems to be bringing up neo-nazis and Neo nationalism that seems to be coming up
(1:27:49) and I want to know why under Obama Joe Biden was the vice president under Obama
(1:27:54) and they are United States government this is a fact organized a coup against the government of Ukraine and Ukraine is
(1:28:01) known as one of the number one countries where our NE where neo-nazis are going to train you have the AA ban you have
(1:28:06) the right sector one the AA Battalion I think it it's most had like six or 700 people that might have been identified
(1:28:12) as NE nais uh maybe number one uh number two the United States did not engage in
(1:28:17) any type of coup or there is a coup it it's reported yeah yeah Victoria newand
(1:28:22) I understand I'm aware the all she said was why why did they remove jeffre from
(1:28:31) the from another evidence was ConEd delusional CRA person
(1:28:40) person because of midala no no no no yet it doesn't matter
(1:28:47) you don't understand what happen and you're making up claims that aren't true this is these are actual recordings from
(1:28:52) Victor we've heard them times because it's the only things that you guys can propagate to try to claim that the United States engag a you haven't
(1:28:58) brought this up at all I'm bringing it up right now you've been voted out by the
(1:29:09) majority hi hi um so I just want to address the fact uh recently we had a
(1:29:15) debate and so there wasn't any fact checks on uh KLA Harris really anytime
(1:29:22) especially when she claimed that Dem rats don't support uh third trimester abortion and that it never happens that
(1:29:28) recently happened not too long ago Washington DC with Caesar Sant Angelo there were five third trimester babies
(1:29:34) who were aborted we've seen this with Kermit Gosnell as well what can I ask what were those five babies aborted for
(1:29:42) uh why does that matter they were still killed third trimester fully developed their SP completely SN was the were the
(1:29:48) was the abortion a part of like a medical procedure for the life of the mother no no so it was a totally elective okay up afterwards my
(1:29:55) understanding is one this is incredibly rare two I don't even know if the vast majority of Democrats would support this three I don't know if the vast majority
(1:30:00) of like Pro Choice people would support this but the thing is over 90% of of Democrats actually don't they are okay
(1:30:06) with out they are okay with there not being any limits on abortion if we look at the states if we look at the states
(1:30:12) there's six States including Washington DC which is a district that has no restrictions on abortion that means that
(1:30:18) all of those states are Democrat States so yes that side is perpetuating and at least setting it very dangerous
(1:30:24) precedent that this can happen in those States I think the reason why they advocate for no laws in those States and I would like maybe there's a better way
(1:30:30) to craft a law for it but the problem is that if you make it illegal then if a medical issue does come up there's a potential roadblock or a hurdle there
(1:30:35) where a person might die waiting to get some type of like legal someone always dies in an abortion someone always dies
(1:30:40) a human being always dies with all due respect this is an insane position and I'm not going to take the POS I'm not
(1:30:45) going to take the position that the the life of the fetus is going to be prioritized over the life of the mother because you want to make an abortion
(1:30:51) illegal there in that case I don't think you have the right to make decis I think the mother and I think that the
(1:30:56) family should be making that decision I don't think that the government should be stepping in and saying we're the government should allow people to kill
(1:31:02) people for no reason but you're saying that you're saying that you would turn the woman away from medical treatment because she can't engage in an abortion
(1:31:08) no that's not what I'm saying that's not the claim that I'm making what I'm saying is is that that side is saying
(1:31:13) that no one supports it that no laws are giving precedent for third trimester abortions when that's happening and even
(1:31:20) if it is a small number say it's 1% of all abortions that's still over 15,000 abortions that's three times the amount
(1:31:27) of kids who die in school shootings which is a tragedy and that's an issue we all need to fix that's still significant amount of people that are
(1:31:33) dying from abortion and no Democrat is acknowledging that and I think it should be at least acknowledged okay I mean if
(1:31:39) Republicans want to put together any type of like pro-choice legislation that they feel like Democrats would support I mean then they can have that
(1:31:45) conversation but obviously that's never going to happen so when Democrats are Eng because when Democrats are engaging that with that conversation with
(1:31:50) Republicans Republicans bring up the third trimester stuff but you guys don't actually care about third trimester why do we because I'm because you're care
(1:31:57) about all three trimesters you just use it exactly so you don't want to ban third trimester abortion you want to ban all abortion hyper fixate on the third
(1:32:03) trimester abortion as a way to get it's happening because your side denies that it happens and it does happen even if they acknowledge that it happened or
(1:32:09) even if they ban third triester abortion you guys would still want to get rid of all abortion okay with third trimester abortion I'm okay pause please return to
(1:32:14) your
(1:32:22) seats number one I'm a magga Gangster I'm outside when it comes to Trump have you ever been to a
(1:32:29) rally that's one I don't know if you book smart or really outside cuz I'm
(1:32:34) outside I'm outside and and you basically said maggus Thrive off for
(1:32:40) lies first of all you ever seen a trump rally you don't see all of the unity and love out there nope I see things saying
(1:32:46) like all the immigrants and I see more magga flags and I see I see American FL you support all right let me ask you
(1:32:51) this you support black lives matter not that much but black lives matter only when media put it out that's number one
(1:33:00) Trump is bringing a lot of unity and love you support buron and looting that's what you support and it Tri me
(1:33:07) out how you could support someone that just want want the world to just go
(1:33:13) crazy burnning and looting and I heard you say something earlier that's crazy you said you hate America talk about
(1:33:20) that I don't think I ever said I hate America yes you did and made me look at
(1:33:25) you what earlier you said it earlier I don't think so I think I I think I said
(1:33:30) that like America I like America I don't think Mega people like America I don't
(1:33:36) think you guys have any idea what it means to be American I don't think you know what American values are I don't think you know what this country was founded or built upon and I think you
(1:33:42) guys are obsessed with a cult leader who is taking the entire Republican party off of a everything he say he do Trump
(1:33:48) is gangsta remember can you give me one thing you don't like about Trump what I don't like about him I love everything I
(1:33:54) know because it's a cult thank you it's not a cult no it's not a everything is a cult
(1:34:00) if you want to think about it okay everything is a cult to a to somebody in a cult that's probably true yeah see
(1:34:06) someone that's representing and Kamala kumala whatever her name is she out of
(1:34:11) here Trump 2024 let's go
(1:34:22) [Music] hi hi Jenny nice to meet you nice to meet you so you think that people that
(1:34:30) um support Trump are in a cult why is that um I feel like Donald Trump is
(1:34:35) basically Untouchable he can do no wrong the entire conservative party is basically centered around Donald Trump any person that goes against Donald
(1:34:41) Trump it can be so many people everybody still looks at all of those people around him as being the fault and never
(1:34:47) Donald Trump When Donald Trump was in office it was because of the swamp when people like bar turned against him it was because he was a rhino when people
(1:34:53) like McCarthy didn't you know like Carri us anywh it's because he's a rhino people like like it's this labeling of every single person around that says
(1:34:58) he's a bad guy is oh those people are rhinos and Trump is great and Trump can no can do no wrong basically uh I think
(1:35:03) that's false I think I don't think Trump is a perfect human being I think anybody out here that's voting for Trump knows
(1:35:10) that he is not innocent no top businessman no top politician got to the top without getting their hands dirty I
(1:35:17) think what we're all voting for is based on his policies I think he prioritizes the economy I think he stands for
(1:35:23) women's rights and that is something that's very very important to me do you think that Trump likes women do you
(1:35:29) think he respects them at all Trump loves women I don't know if he respects them um when we say that people um no
(1:35:37) why not I think the types of statements alone that he makes about women I think call that into question um but the you
(1:35:43) said earlier that people support Trump because of his policies I don't think that's true because I don't even know what policies of trump that nobody even
(1:35:49) talks about them oh really he posted on his Twitter he posted that like like 20 promises he's going to make to America
(1:35:56) he's going to make trans women competing in women's sports illegal I think that
(1:36:01) is something that needs to be said that he does support women in that R are these things that we are these like the
(1:36:07) most important issues to you I think so okay I I am a woman after all at least I know a lot of NCAA or whatever athletic
(1:36:14) events I attended San Jose State I graduated from there you do realize that there is a transgender person that's on
(1:36:21) that volleyball team and nobody on that team was was told that there was a transgender woman on there I I just I
(1:36:26) didn't know this is the largest issue in the election for you it just seems like a pretty minor thing all I think women's rights in general is a big thing okay
(1:36:32) but not the right to an [Applause]
(1:36:40) abortion so you talk about misinformation but you've given us a ton of misinformation right now you said
(1:36:46) seems like nobody in MAA even wants to talk about any of the issues of Donald Trump had multiple Debaters come up talk to you about multiple economic policies
(1:36:52) compare and contrast with comma gave you great reason I don't think I heard any Economic Policy from Trump when he was
(1:36:58) in for year economic Poli no back up now you're switching the claim so what you just claimed is I don't hear MAA people
(1:37:04) talk about this at all I don't think I heard any that's what you said and yes they did they brought up they brought up
(1:37:09) the capital gains policies they also brought up they also brought up tariffs they brought up the Tariff policies they
(1:37:14) brought up multiple economic policies total misinfo total misinfo for you to say they didn't they absolutely did are
(1:37:21) you disputing that nobody here brought up any policies of Don I think that when you're talking policies from somebody if
(1:37:26) the only thing you have are terrorists it's not really a strong policy Foundation I'm sorry I'm sorry did you use the word any you don't hear anybody
(1:37:33) talk about that speaking like a human being right now oh but when Donald Trump speaks like a human being he's a liar
(1:37:38) doesn't speak like human being yeah anytime I'm sorry but Donald Trump speaks like an idot would you say it's misinformation for instance is it
(1:37:45) misinformation when you say that a firefighter who got murdered at a rally
(1:37:50) when you laugh at that and you say that that's totally fine are you spreading misinformation I said that's totally
(1:37:55) fine I think I said I don't really have any sympathy for no you didn't you laughed about it you thought it was funny you didn't give a [ __ ] you were
(1:38:02) under Fire on Twitter for it for weeks until you finally backed away you I haven't backed away from any of those statements you find you haven't backed
(1:38:07) away from any of them no not at all you don't care that the guy died right people died R when when this side is
(1:38:13) when this side is involved most violent device here's a question here's a question that does not do with Miss info
(1:38:19) here's a question do you dis any of the rhetoric about Paul P do you dis the r Pauli what even if I made any outrageous
(1:38:27) claim possible has nothing to do with your claim which is what we talking about your CLA he doesn't of course not
(1:38:33) does what happened on January 6 he doesn't acknowledge right now because theyed
(1:38:38) that the federal govern are yeah you say stop sping over and over
(1:38:44) again I'm not here to talk about my tweets but that's what you really want to you do it I've TW crazier [ __ ] that I promise are you gonna acknowledge that
(1:38:51) you said totally fine he didn't care you just said right now you don't care how is it now let me explain how I'm going
(1:38:58) to explain how it's misinformation because don't you think that if you make claims like Donald Trump is UN American
(1:39:03) Donald Trump doesn't like the Constitution and then you have an assassin come he tries to kill Donald J Trump at a rally and another American
(1:39:10) dies aren't you spreading misinformation by saying to people this is okay isn't that unamerican ever said this is okay
(1:39:17) I've said over and over again that there shouldn't be any political violence in the United States it's not good you can laugh you guys are the ones said that in
(1:39:24) January 6 he said it during January after he sat and watched it happen for 3 hours after the guy died now you're
(1:39:29) sorry about your rhetoric who said I was sorry EXC stop projecting on to me I never said I was sorry about anything
(1:39:35) I've not said that yeah unlike you I have a spine over over the things that I say okay number one number two Donald Trump and your side of the on in engage
(1:39:41) divisive rhetoric for years this idea that saying Donald Trump is unamerican When Donald Trump himself says that he' be a day one dictator he would suspend
(1:39:48) the Constitution I'm sorry if if the divisive assina Trump's problem maybe
(1:39:55) has led to assassination attempts and one of the guys who died there you don't even give a [ __ ] and I've said this
(1:40:00) multiple times and at the same time you're like oh I love America what kind of [ __ ] is this Destin
(1:40:06) unbelievable you guys start taking accountability for some of the crazy things that you say come and talk to me okay come and talk to
(1:40:12) [Applause] me okay so we're going to do a five minute extension
(1:40:23) all right I want to go back to kind of your original claim um which this information well can you restate your
(1:40:30) original claim I think magga thrives on disinformation they are in a totally different reality now than they ever have been so that actually wasn't your
(1:40:36) original claim your original claim was that the mag wouldn't exist without the amount of dis yeah something right okay
(1:40:42) okay so how can you possibly know that well I I can't know all possible worlds
(1:40:47) if they wouldn't right exactly so so right off the bat your initial claim is false okay well if this was a philosophy
(1:40:54) 101 class and you've completely and totally debunked me sir yeah wow great I've
(1:41:00) debunked great great um well so great your initial claim is false glad you can
(1:41:05) admit that um now you want to go to the disinformation uh topic um well one I
(1:41:11) think uh a lot of the rhetoric that you're spewing is very divisive for for
(1:41:16) our nation um because a lot of the times you're assuming people's intentions on
(1:41:21) these things right you're assuming that people are purposefully ignorant when you're in no uh no position to actually
(1:41:29) know something like that I don't know people are purposely ignorant or not I actually unironically I hold the individuals a lot less accountable than
(1:41:34) I do the content creators but you don't talk to people like that well I usually I'm talking to content creators even
(1:41:40) most of the people in here I think are like on Tik Tok or something else a lot of these I've seen a lot of these faces okay so that's an assumption without any
(1:41:46) evidence um are you saying that I'm assuming without evidence that most of the people that I talk to tend to be like most of the people in this room
(1:41:53) that's what you're assuming okay um so so anyways uh again you're you're
(1:41:59) assuming the intentions of these people and that's and that's not true you're assuming that we're part of this Maga cult which is not true at all I mean the
(1:42:06) guy here earlier literally said that Trump maybe maybe some some people right
(1:42:12) and I don't believe that Trump can do no wrong and I think most Republicans believe that right I I'm disgusted by
(1:42:17) some of his personal Behavior I think his stance is on abortion uh he's G way
(1:42:22) too far left you've been voted out by the majority hey well uh your original claim was false so that's great to
(1:42:35) hear so um you know you made the claim that magga wouldn't exist or make
(1:42:40) America wouldn't exist without um obviously not a true statement I think you just admitted that
(1:42:46) well I mean likely they would I can't prove that 100% okay and I mean and this started way back during the Reagan years so you know that I think it's
(1:42:52) accelerated a lot with social media and it accelerated a lot under Trump and mega because Trump is the first guy that just lies with impunity and there's no
(1:42:58) accountability on the conservative side when he does so speaking of people who you know who believe in Maggie you know
(1:43:03) it seems like based off of the re rhetoric that you have said you know all of all of the people in here and the th
(1:43:09) the millions of people who are kind of fall under that umbrella of you know believing in make America great again
(1:43:16) you know you you act like you we're some cult and we're you know some evil people all of us are human every person in this
(1:43:21) room immigrant you guys about stop interrupting me I'm talking I'm talking
(1:43:28) I'm talking I'm talking I'm talking I'm talking so am let's be respectful I don't have to be so everyone here in
(1:43:34) this room is human and people who are make America great again and who go to these Trump rallies love each other and
(1:43:40) love other people and love humans and want to you know they want to see the betterment of society and betterment of
(1:43:45) everybody in this country return to your seats
(1:43:52) [Music] what's up Stephen okay so again I think
(1:43:58) that the misinformation is far more rampant on your side K Harris big misinform okay project 2025 huge
(1:44:05) misinformation not Trump's misinformation Trump Trump's Vance probably supports and I think Trump Broadley Trump is Trump Vance Vance yeah
(1:44:11) you can say he supports a lot of things yeah okay can VPS and presidents disagree with each other I guess Pence
(1:44:17) and him disagree quite a bit I guess that's fine okay and there there have been plenty of examples of this in past
(1:44:22) like uh kley and Roosevelt disagreed staunchly okay so this is not rare
(1:44:27) project 2025 is Comm Harris's primary talking point and it is not Trump's agenda Trump has his own agenda published on his website agenda 47 there
(1:44:34) are some overlaps there he agrees with some things in that um project but not all of them the primary one being again
(1:44:40) Comm Harris's biggest talking point which is that Trump is going to Institute a National Abortion ban which he has publicly disavowed uh well I think the problem
(1:44:46) with for a long time I don't think he would say no to that although I think he has said that he wouldn't vote on it over and over again he said no I've
(1:44:52) heard him go back and forth on it um personally I don't like the project 2025 talking point I think it's kind of cringe I don't know misformation um what
(1:44:57) I call goost far to call it misinformation I'm not sure but even if I would call it call information because it's because it's written by
(1:45:03) conservative think tank well I might say that if if even if I were to grant that as to be Mis
(1:45:09) information it's nowhere near on the level of Haitians are eating cats and dogs okay uh do you think that I I
(1:45:14) actually argue the totally the opposite right I think that it definitely is on that level considering she's prescribing
(1:45:19) Trump's entire policy platform trying to claim that Trump's entire policy platform is something that it isn't and there are lots of things that
(1:45:25) Republicans disagree in that policy it's a lie and if Donald Trump wanted to fight against it maybe he could just have a policy platform and they just he
(1:45:31) does have a policy platform agenda 47 it's on his yeah I've read it joke it's things like we're going to bring down
(1:45:36) the interest rates he can't even do that with's policy platform entire section on housing is four paragraphs yeah but she
(1:45:42) can't bring down interest rates at the very least there's some solid stuff there even if I think it's a little bit too far are you saying there's no policy proposals at I'm saying that Donald
(1:45:49) Trump When Donald Trump speaks he doesn't talk it's more flushed out than her plan I don't think okay her entire
(1:45:54) Housing section is four paragraphs in one of them I would hardly count Parra I think it's one paragraph four time four
(1:46:00) times better good okay please return to your [Applause]
(1:46:09) seat oh yeah um actually you know
(1:46:14) what this one right over
(1:46:21) here I chose you cuz you'll break my heart the most cuz you sound somewhat reasonable intelligent but you just say the craziest things and yeah so now I'm
(1:46:29) just going to try to figure out for 10 minutes if you really believe it or if you're hardcore just carrying water for some political side so Stephen my claim
(1:46:35) is that President Biden should pardon president Trump no matter who wins the election President Biden ran on Unity
() 
(1:46:43) when he came and gave that inauguration speech on January 20th 2021 he wanted to unify the country the best way for
(1:46:49) President Biden to leave office is to Pardon president Trump and to try to
(1:46:55) bring the country together I think as a magum movement 75 million people may look at Biden and say look we have our
(1:47:01) political disagreements with this guy but the fact that he pardoned Trump much like Gerald Ford did much like there's
(1:47:06) examples in our country of folks Reaching Across The Island doing at that point I think you could probably argue
(1:47:12) that Trump has the authority to Pardon himself largely these cases will drop if he doesn't win the election but I think
(1:47:18) it'd be a very powerful signal for the unity of the country for President Biden to Pardon him I think there are at least
(1:47:24) three really good reasons why that should absolutely never happen Okay so the first one is uh Donald Trump doesn't
(1:47:31) need to be pardoned because the Supreme Court's already said that the president can enjoy full and absolute criminal
(1:47:36) immunity when he's doing his job so if he's already gotten that carve out from the Supreme Court why should he need any
(1:47:41) more help to be pardoned for any other types of crimes unless we're saying that he did crimes that weren't even part of the job of being the
(1:47:47) president I would say that's the first one you want to do the other two or you want the other two um the second one is
(1:47:52) I think that Donald Trump has done abhorent things in the abusive office that I think he absolutely should be
(1:47:58) accountable for I think that he should answer for these things I think it's destructive to lead this idea that you can act Above the Law um and get away
(1:48:05) with it and um I think for the third point the idea that Democrats have to be the ones that continue to come to the
(1:48:11) table and like okay we're going to do this or okay we're going to try to heal and okay we're going to do Unity when you've got Biden up here you know saying
(1:48:16) like I'm going to be a president for everybody I'm going to do unity and then Donald Trump is saying things like immigrants are the poison to the lifeblood of this nation like crazy
(1:48:22) stuff like this I like the the back and forth of of of conservatives being unhinged and Democrats having to like
(1:48:28) apologize for Behavior I don't like the double stand anymore I don't think you can exist inside of it okay let's talk about President Biden and the unity claim you do agree that he ran on the
(1:48:35) platform of unity and theme of his inauguration we can both agree on that right Stephen y when he called Maga
(1:48:40) Republicans a threat to democracy was that a sign of unity that speech absolutely is and really yes you read
(1:48:47) the whole speech he says over and over again in a totally pointless manner because and I'm aware uh because I'm
(1:48:53) part of the Tik Tok culture as well um he said over and over again not even most Republicans are Maga Republicans
(1:48:58) when he said Maga Republicans he was talking about the subsection of people that deny the results of the last
(1:49:03) election that don't even believe in things like institutions or peaceful transfers of power or the country
(1:49:09) operating as like a cohesive unit he spells out over and over again that he's not talking about all conservatives but people just clip that one line and then
(1:49:14) the picture with the red behind him and say oh my God look at what he was saying as a matter of fact though 72% of
(1:49:19) Republicans believe that there were serious issues in the 2020 election just as a matter of they believe that well
(1:49:25) just as As a matter of empirical fact so you've got 70% of 75 million people believe that
(1:49:33) you are still making a very wide and sweeping statement about workingclass Americans black white hispanic Americans
(1:49:39) saying that they're a threat to democracy I don't know if all of them necessarily don't believe like hardcore that there was like voter rigging as
(1:49:45) opposed to the media was biased or something because Trump kind of used to dance around those claims but for as much as people believe that there were
(1:49:51) issues with the election it's because Donald Trump told them that's it like and a lot of the lies that started out in the Trump camp we know now were
(1:49:58) completely in holy fabricate everything having to do with that State Farm video was a total lie from the very beginning everything having to do with Dominion
(1:50:03) voting machines was a total lie from the very beginning um there are so many of these claims that when you look at the very the Genesis of them they were
(1:50:08) either fabricated or were maliciously constructed but doesn't President Biden have an obligation to be a president for
(1:50:14) all Americans even those who vehemently disagree with him when you say vehemently disagree yes
(1:50:21) but for people that don't believe in the results of the election this is the issue is that conservatives have pushed
(1:50:27) the boundaries of what you can tolerate in a society that can function together right if a conservative wants to come
(1:50:33) out and say I think that we need small government and I don't believe in in in the government you know providing all
(1:50:38) this relief and all this or whatever and I think we should have small government or whatever okay I disagree with that that's fine whatever we can still exist
(1:50:44) together and we can argue okay but when people are saying I'm I'm not there was a phone call into a radio show um where
(1:50:49) the guy's talking about his father-in-law is is turning away FEMA because he thinks that FEA is going to steal his house that's we we breaking
(1:50:58) down institions to a point to where we can't function we need institutions as much as we might head and we need them to function and conservatives spend
(1:51:03) every breath undermining them and that is becoming dysfunctional I don't know what you're supposed to do in that circumstance well I I think what you can
(1:51:10) do is and I'm not saying this isn't without risk there's certainly some negative Optics to it but I would say
(1:51:16) that that gesture I'll tell you you take away the ammunition from one side if you
(1:51:21) say going to extend the olive branch and by the way even if it's
(1:51:27) purely ceremonial and symbolic even if the president can end up pardoning himself even if president Trump
(1:51:34) wins then the question becomes why doesn't Biden do that as a symbol of genuine Unity genuine Unity I don't
(1:51:41) think I don't think there is an olive branch that would be accepted I don't I don't think anybody would see it as any type of I think that arguably I've seen
(1:51:49) back and forth on this that Merrick Garland probably dragged his feet on Prosecuting Trump and and in uh po
(1:51:55) pointing Jack Smith and and in all the charges that were filed and that that was a massive mistake that he shouldn't
(1:52:00) have waited on that that that should have been something he moved much quicker on but because of this obsession with liberals and the media to appear unbiased and to be nice to both sides
(1:52:06) and to treat both sides equally even when in my opinion obviously one side is acting far more recklessly it's
(1:52:11) destroying the country um we talked about Israel Palestine earlier we can talk about like children in the store when somebody is acting inappropriately
(1:52:18) or they're acting out of line or behaving in a way that is unsustainable that behavior has to be brought in line
(1:52:23) somehow you cannot run a ship when when half the people are are are trying to uh Row in the other direction and right now
(1:52:30) conservatives are undermining every single facet of this country and I don't know how we're supposed to function in that environment right where we say like
(1:52:36) okay well we're going to go ahead and Parton Trump what if we pardon Trump and then he just commits more crimes or what if we pardon Trump and then the next Republican president goes well I can
(1:52:42) probably get away with it because they're going to cuck out for Unity in the end so it'll be great right what do you do with that
(1:52:47) point I disagree with you on conservatives threatening the country I would even say that
(1:52:53) Democrats don't threaten the country I think most Americans want a secure border on economy that works for
(1:52:58) everybody good education to your point about you know quibbles over tax policy and regulation do you believe that a
(1:53:05) supporter of the deportation of illegal migrants falls into that category of a
(1:53:10) radical conservative I think that's a radical position but I don't think that's like a Beyond The Pale position I think it's done for a variety of reasons
(1:53:16) but no I don't think that's beyond the pale right and I mean look axio IPOs found this in April that 55% of Americans not just conservatives
(1:53:23) Americans support the mass deportation of illegal migrants 46% of Democrats do
(1:53:28) why do you think that is when you look at places like Chicago and New York why long time for a variety of reasons but again this isn't an issue it's like the
(1:53:34) minimum wage I think that we probably need a minimum wage but I don't think that agreeing or disagreeing on this makes American same thing with like abortion which is way more charged I
(1:53:41) don't think it makes you unamerican things like immunity for crimes for the president that's a deeply unamerican
(1:53:46) value that the president can't be charged with criminal Behavior even in the role of his job that in my opinion that's deeply unamerican the undermining
(1:53:52) of all the institions that the America should have no role as like a world leader um that the way that we look at
(1:53:57) immigrants as enemies or that we don't want to trade with anybody because we you just want that these things are not
(1:54:03) I I wouldn't say the trade thing I would say that like the immunity thing are really big one the idea of America needing to receed from the world is a
(1:54:09) big one um the idea of like the weaponizing of all of the the doj that Trump wants to do these are things that
(1:54:14) deeply concern me talking about terminating the Constitution and and all these things yeah so we can we can have
(1:54:19) our disagreements there's a lot there we could pick up we've only got
(1:54:26) but you an American I'm an American I believe that you love this country I believe that you want the best for this
(1:54:31) country the best for your family Donald Trump wins on November 5th
(1:54:37) genuinely genuinely what is one piece of advice you give
(1:54:43) him if Donald Trump wins what is one piece of advice that you give him Donald
(1:54:48) Trump after he's gone will have family members that remain in this world that carry his name through the world he will
(1:54:54) have a legacy he'll have a reputation and that the way that he acts in his last four years as president will be
(1:55:00) remembered for the rest of history for as long as America continues to exist and that he has an opportunity in his
(1:55:06) second term at least to write some of the wrongs of the first term or to prove people like me wrong at least when I
(1:55:12) said that the United States would become an authoritarian hellhole or whatever else that he has an opportunity to to to prove people like me wrong and I hope
(1:55:18) that he would take advantage of that I think that' be great I think that would be great for the country country to tell you the truth is there is there one
(1:55:26) policy one position that you agree with Donald Trump on even even remotely um
(1:55:32) the problem is I I just don't like his thought process so there are going to be things that we agree on but like we're going to agree on them for totally
(1:55:38) different reason example um like in general I'm not as big on like Dei or
(1:55:44) affirmative action type stuff I think for a variety of reasons has a lot of different issues um I think that having
(1:55:50) a secure border is really important arguably one of the most important things about having a country is having a border um I think the Democrats like
(1:55:56) broadly agree that as well um I think that um yeah I could probably find other things but like our Agreements are going
(1:56:02) to be very roundabout it's we're not we're not getting here the same way but I think the creation of the space force
(1:56:07) was good um I obviously all the conservatives hate it but I thought warp speed was a tremendous achievement of capitalism of pharmaceuticals of the
(1:56:13) United States and US leadership T yeah yeah no you're right I mean I think the big picture though and can we just give
(1:56:21) can we give him a round of applause no I don't want to round Applause oh my
(1:56:27) God I'm I'm a I'm a big believer Stephen that when we come together as a country
(1:56:32) and have conversations difficult conversations like this we may not walk away saying well I agree with Stephen or
(1:56:37) I agree with James or I agree with any of the folks here but you walk away saying that's a person that's an
(1:56:43) American we can disagree agreeably and I might understand for just a moment their
(1:56:49) perspectives I want to thank you for being here I think that the biggest thing for the the country going forward in a in a sense is how do we have more
(1:56:57) debate not less more disagreement not less unfortunately I totally disagree with you I was there a while ago um it's
(1:57:04) not enough to just have conversations anymore I think we have to start taking steps in an actual Direction I think we're right now we are talking ourselves
(1:57:10) off a ledge and I notice a lot of times when I have challenging conversations with people I get all of these comments that pop up whether it's me talking to
(1:57:16) Peterson Shapiro Owens of like what a great civil conversation but at the end of the day nobody's mind comes away changed and everybody still feels the
(1:57:21) same way and we're still accelerating off of each other faster than we ever have been before but at least we're having good conversations on the way
(1:57:27) down to the base of the cliff I guess well let let me end a start let let me end on a bipartisan note Stephen let's
(1:57:34) not just make debate great again let's build it back better okay
(1:57:43) thanks I think I did about as well as I could have I mean there's always more like itty bitty pieces of factual
(1:57:49) information that I could have but it's hard to keep track of everything but yeah I think it was okay maybe I could have been meaner to some people but I'm
(1:57:56) okay I think that James did really well um I think that Destiny himself did really well too uh I think that Destiny
(1:58:01) is probably the best debater in the space on either side um so I think that
(1:58:07) we did really well against him considering that fact I think that debate is important U I guess kind of counter to what Destiny thinks even
(1:58:13) though he's a professional debater part of democracy is talking you know we see these Global con conflicts in Israel
(1:58:20) what's happening with Russia in Ukraine is because people aren't talking I think
(1:58:25) that the Republican party today and president Trump are they want we want peace we want to bring people back to
(1:58:31) the talking table and for people to be civil so there was some personal attacks here and there but I think for the most
(1:58:37) part everybody stayed on the substance of the issue there were some heated moments that's okay but I think we all
(1:58:43) walked away not necessarily convinced that the other side is right and we're wrong but at least we see where the
(1:58:49) other side is coming from and that helps bring this country together
