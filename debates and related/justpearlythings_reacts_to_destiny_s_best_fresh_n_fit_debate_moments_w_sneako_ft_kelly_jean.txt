(0:00) I actually think that like women like to be cheated on huh it's on the average BMI for woman is 26.5 oh I stand
(0:07) corrected and that means I meant probably about 40 to 50 pounds more because they're taller right but I think it's just fat people share with fat
(0:12) people there's always this like I feel like there's this it's so strange on these shows they present it as like people like down or something right you
(0:19) see somebody you smile that's what he does he'll bring up like this random thing that's such a good counteractive
(0:24) it's true I've
(0:31) I've had guys play games with me if I play games back that's on me it's not because of him you're either someone
(0:37) that plays games or you're not someone that plays games you don't have to play play games because of who you're dating
(0:42) sorry go ahead go ahead if you want to interrupt you though
(0:48) if you want to have a I don't know the problem
(0:55) anything you've said ever welcome to the channel guys hi what's up
()

(1:20) then go ahead Kelly introduce yourself he's okay um let's have the real special guest start to talk and real special yeah
(1:30) uh I'm Kelly Jean and I am a cosplayer from England so hi nice to meet y'all
(1:36) today we are going to be reacting to Destiny's time on fresh and fit
(1:41) um you're gonna pull the clip Up was this the last time you were on or when
(1:46) when was this um yeah I'm gonna say last time looks like it okay I actually have not seen
(1:52) this clip so I'm excited what was more chaotic like what was more
(1:58) nothing has been more chaotic than the show I was on two nights ago I think anything in my life has been working out
(2:04) after that so yeah that's Fair Point how many bodies you got oh my
(2:09) God get out get out I feel like women love more I think on average I think women are more emotionally mature and I
(2:16) think that love outside of like the fairy tale requires a lot of actual like emotional upkeep a lot of emotional
(2:21) labor I think a lot of guys can't put that in I don't think feeling possessive or jealous is love just because you get
(2:26) like really asked mad if your woman does something or if you get like really jealous or possessive what is the question he asked I think women in
(2:31) general I think they're letting me pause it but yeah the question was who loves more men or women
() 
(2:37) how do you quantify love such a bizarre question yeah I don't know it's kind of a silly question but they're I think
(2:43) their method of quantifying it is that like any man will love any woman so therefore men love more
(2:49) um whereas I think if you make love more conditional that feels like more of a love thing to me but I mean it's kind of it's a very subjective question but um
(2:57) it's very broad who loves more I feel like when a girl actually like I feel
(3:03) like a girl loves more like when you're that guy but in general like men Love More
(3:08) I don't know what that means okay like okay so if
(3:14) foreign
(3:27) Jack and Rose on the Titanic right yeah okay Rose had this whole fiance right
(3:33) she jumps off the ship for this guy she just met so when she felt like she was in love with the guy she's going crazy
(3:40) she's doing crazy [ __ ] okay but I feel like in general like most men are the
(3:45) fiance they're Jack but their girl isn't like or they're not Jack the other guy's name you know what I'm talking about
(3:51) yeah oh my god did she did Rose have a
(3:57) college degree do you think probably probably she was 26. oh no on Instagram
(4:02) too much probably um yeah it's it's a it's a silly it's hard to quantify like everybody can get
(4:08) obsessed with each other like everybody can be weird every it's I think it's hard to no I am yeah but I will it's not like you could find facts you know I
(4:16) will say on these shows though that when you're saying that like I don't care what you say but if you're
(4:21) a guy doing a one like advocating for a one-ended open relationships it's hard to say that you love there more than
(4:28) your like girlfriend or wife does I think you don't think it's different for men and for women cheating no because
(4:33) you're I'm not you're you're in like the open on both ends
(4:39) okay I don't go ahead I don't go as hard as you want no I'm not go for it yeah
(4:44) let's do it go ahead I'm polite I don't no you're not gonna be worn go for it no
(4:49) I just mean like isn't that awkward like isn't it I don't know because I'm just
(4:54) thinking like like if you look at it from a historical perspective like women had to get the highest value Guy where
(4:59) men they wanted to like reproduce so from a historical perspective like what value would that bring
(5:05) like a woman being promiscuous well so my Approach is is that I want to be promiscuous you know I want to be
(5:12) promiscuous I can't tell my girlfriend not to be promiscuous so it has to be like I don't think relationships work if
(5:19) you have like maximum openness on one and a maximum closing the other that's always going to be a recipe for disaster so then in my world it's either do you
(5:25) want to be monogamous or do you just not want to be like married or date anybody and just be like single be a [ __ ] boy forever
(5:31) yeah I mean I wouldn't really prefer to be to be up where someone's open on one end either but
(5:38) I feel like a lot of times like girls do it for free
(5:43) you know what I mean girls do wet for free where it's like open on one end and close no that is unbelievably rare and
(5:50) if the girl finds out she's gonna she will get mad and leave the guy
(5:58) for free she's saying that women naturally gravitate towards or allow guys to like cheat and don't care that much oh I don't think so I don't think
(6:04) so I actually think that like women like to be cheated on huh no not particularly but it's like every
() 
(6:13) time I ask the girls on the show it'll be like we'll talk about cheating right and um
(6:19) they'll bring up their ex that cheated and my next question is always something wrong blessing oh we've been
(6:27) oh did I oh sorry okay um but my next question is always like
(6:32) did you stay and the question they always say yes yeah but guys and girls and then and then I asked them like do
(6:38) when did you guys break up like when did it end it's always when they stop cheating and I'm like why why didn't you
(6:43) leave the first time if you didn't like the cheating like that doesn't make sense to me okay so what happens is people get obsessed with each other they
(6:51) break up it's called yo-yoing where people will date and they break up and they come back but they won't do that but I'm saying they didn't break up when
(6:58) they when he cheated the first time so it's like in my head if you didn't like the cheating you would leave when he
(7:03) cheated yeah some people I mean there's a lot of things and when I first heard this I thought it was crazy I was like
(7:09) there's no way girls like similar to an addiction it's the roller coaster and then they go back because they miss yeah
(7:15) but they didn't leave that's what I'm saying okay they go back and they have a fight and then they're still together that's the same thing but then but then
(7:21) why would you leave when he stops cheating probably because the rest of the relationship was still messed up in some way that's what I'm imagine do you
(7:28) really believe that most women like being cheated on yeah I think I do I didn't before I started the show okay I
(7:33) did it before I started the show and then I I just had the same because it's like I just start to meet the same people over and over again I'm just like
(7:41) this is a pattern okay did any of them tell you they liked being cheated on I mean they didn't say that but their
(7:46) actions it's like it's like their actions showed it do you think women like being abused do I think they like
(7:52) being a b why do we gotta go to abuse well I'm just asking there's a lot of women that's what they do they'll be like we'll be talking about a and then
(7:58) he brings up B because a lot of women I didn't say abused I didn't say abused a lot of women like to stay in abusive
(8:05) relationships so do they like it because they stay there um
(8:10) so I feel like this is like a trap question it's like a trap it's like this is like to be addicts well because you're
(8:18) like the choices you know honestly I think some addicts do I do I know this
(8:23) is yeah I have relatives that are addicts oh and it's like
(8:28) yeah okay they freaking they just keep doing the same thing over and over again based okay
(8:41) is love just because you get like really asked mad if your woman does something or if you get like really jealous or
(8:46) possess everyone doesn't mean you love her more so I think women in general are willing to put more emotional work in relationships so yeah would you also say
(8:54) this out to the argument here that women break up with men more than men because women what do you think uh that has to
(9:01) be true yeah I mean I think that's true but it's such a dumb question why is it a dumb
(9:07) question because there might be a different Tolerance on both sides for bad or stupid Behavior right
(9:13) yeah but like why don't you just answer the question that's what you do you like I think I do it
(9:19) like I don't know and I'm like did I say I don't know through this video at this right or only two minutes that's why I
(9:25) like having Destiny on I disagree with Destiny I think men love far more wait go back I didn't hear my answer
(9:34) sorry I'm trigger happy I love this lady that's my future not right
(9:40) okay your future second wife do you want a second one yeah third and a fourth third and a fourth I'm gonna convert to Islam so I get all these guys to come
(9:46) and defend me when I do bad stuff okay because you get like really asked mad if your woman does something or if you get like really jealous or possessive one
(9:52) doesn't you love her more so I think women in general are willing to put more emotional work in the relationships so I'll say lay level one would you also
(9:58) say this out to the argument here that women men more than men because women what do you think uh break up with I
(10:06) don't know see you said I don't know um you said I don't know I don't know oh
(10:13) he's doing it again listen yeah I know the divorce the divorce answer is
(10:19) women I don't know just anecdotally why would I it's just why would I fight anecdote versus oh my gosh it's just
(10:26) like it's like sometimes it's like water is wet okay um I don't I don't I know for divorce I
(10:33) think women initiate divorcement I don't know for breakfast wouldn't you think that it's probably similar it might be
(10:38) it might or there might be reasons why it's the opposite I don't know men love women under far less conditions than women love men that sounds like the
(10:44) opposite of love to me well if you love under far less conditions that sounds like desperation I don't want somebody that loves me for like one or two
(10:51) reasons or whatever right I want them to be a lot of reasons why they love me but what I'm saying but see that's that's what I was saying earlier that's what I
(10:57) was saying earlier I feel like man it's like
(11:03) I'm I'm gonna butcher this I know I know but it's like I feel like when men love women it's like
(11:09) it's more common for them to be the fiance in the situation where it's like women have more conditions for them to
(11:14) be like really in love so when they're really in love they're like super in love but the average girl like isn't yeah but
(11:21) then it comes down to semantic of like what does it mean to be more in love right yeah like if somebody tells me like I love you and I was like well why
(11:28) um because I think you're funny and I'm like okay what else I don't know I just think you're really funny and that's it it's like okay but I'm just like oh I
(11:34) love you because you're you know tall good at volleyball red hair if they've
(11:40) got like runs a good Studio they have like 20 reasons like oh wow this person really loves me you know that's what would be my feeling but then it's like
(11:46) well what does it mean to love more there well in that case men love more about my students I've never had a guy
(11:52) know you well enough okay I'm just drawing into whatever I see like I love at first sight like it's more of a
(11:57) simple love Yeah like the more immediate the more like more like faster quicker type of thing
(12:02) but then it's a question of like who loves more than if you fall into love with every person you meet because you think they look good is that loving more
(12:08) than somebody that's like well I love a very specific person but I love them a lot you know I almost I feel like people fall in love based on how the other
(12:14) makes them feel at least from a woman's point of view do you think that's true for men isn't it just hormones and
(12:19) chemistry yeah I mean that's probably true for everybody right like how you feel about somebody is how they make you
(12:25) feel about them yeah is that for a man to love a woman she does not have to jump us through as many
(12:30) hoops and meet as many requirements as for a woman needs to love a man so in other words the guy's got to reach a
(12:36) certain level to even be acknowledged by the woman however that woman she could be mediocre and still get the Garner the
(12:42) love from a man who is superior to in every way which you know from a biological standpoint that makes sense because men dig down and women so we
(12:48) make this is like criticizing women for having standards here I'm not sure it's always what it is yeah I don't think it's criticizing I think it's describing
(12:55) he's literally I think it's just I think it's true you don't think that's true he's literally writing a book called women deserve less I think
(13:04) that's funny you know that's you're laughing that's funny it's like you can't
(13:10) Jesus it's funny but I mean I'm saying it's like yesterday wait there's semantics do
(13:15) you remember that you asked a question yesterday at the end of that Tate interview where you were like do you think that um jokes are just jokes or
(13:21) something and it's like yeah they're jokes but they always like hinted something true so yeah I think people in the red pill communities the general I I
(13:27) thought is that women's standards are too high who would read a book like that presumably not women and then men just
(13:33) get the idea that we need less how is that gonna help them I'm gonna I'm gonna buy the book I'm sure I'm gonna buy it
(13:39) okay well you can let us know I guess I'll give you guys my summary that's great you'll have another bookshelf
(13:45) right next to your own self-published like Pearl's guide to whale hunting or whatever right I never even thought about writing a
(13:52) book but you know what maybe I will gotcha
(14:00) who loves more somebody with high standards or low standards follow SQL because that's what you're essentially
(14:06) saying obviously the person with high standards loves more because you're being more selective of your partner so of course you're gonna love that partner more but that's kind of what I was
(14:12) saying with the jacket okay it's only 100 contingent upon the other parties ability to provide and uh and perform is
(14:18) my point like a woman doesn't have a burden of performance I mean if you're telling guys to like
(14:24) look for a woman that's just young and can cook then of course there's no burden of performance yeah but again like how much of Love is that like I
(14:29) love you so much like why because I can cook and I'm young I can find a million girls that can cook in here if you've got two reasons for it then like yeah
(14:35) that is true but what I'm saying is that if you take a majority of men versus the majority of women a majority of men
(14:41) would like a majority of women however a majority of women definitely don't like a majority of men yeah I agree that's
(14:46) why I think women love more because when they pick somebody The Selective about it they put more time and energy into it for sure whereas for a guide woman is a
(14:52) lot more replaceable so I think what Myron is trying to say though is that like if guys stop doing the things like
(14:58) if a guy's jobless for like two years the girl's gone basically so like how do
(15:03) how do women love more more if if the guy stops doing that stuff I feel like
(15:08) this is more or less this is like differently it's more intelligently more planned or thought of and then more
(15:14) simply on that and and the side of the men but I mean I mean simply can be
(15:19) Charming to like fall in love with someone with that connection without really putting a lot of thought into it
(15:25) it's not necessarily inherently evil or something but the fact that women feel like they have to take more things off
(15:31) so like they feel safe I suppose it's also valid yeah I feel like it's it's hard because it's so subjective I might
(15:38) be an outlier here but I really don't like the concept of unconditional love like I have worked pretty hard in my
(15:45) life to accomplish a certain amount of things I've worked pretty hard to present myself in a certain way I would hope that the person that loves me loves
(15:51) me for those things and if I just became some type of slob that lived at home and did nothing all day and was jobless for
(15:58) two years and didn't do anything that they would probably not love me anymore because if they did then what like what if you're what if your wife got fat
(16:03) would you feel like that the equivalent um I like 300 pounds 300 pounds We're
() 
(16:10) Gonna Roll that ass down the stairs it's kind of conditional both ways well
(16:15) I feel like that's the equivalent as a woman gaining a ton of weight no no she's gone she said she's gone he agrees
(16:21) with me leave the whales 300 pounds leave the whales he agrees at
(16:27) 300 pounds yeah of course because you're talking about it but that's like if I was where is the cutoff if like 200 250
(16:33) like when are you leaving I don't know I don't mind somebody that's chubby if she got like chubby that'd be fine I'm not with her just because of the way that
(16:38) she looks there's a whole other setup she's got like a 30 pounds like she's she's there's a lot of things about her
(16:44) that I like like she's into working out she's into doing outdoorsy stuff she likes to go adventuring traveling my guess is that if she became 300 pounds
(16:50) she's probably not doing any of that anymore right so there's other things that are yeah there's other things that are changing for her to become a 300
(16:56) pound person yeah but come on 300 you know you know even if she was still
(17:02) doing that stuff at 300 pounds you'd be gone I already told you 300 is way over the line yeah give the whale Yes Men
(17:07) leave he agrees with me no I don't think no because I don't know I am so glad we're on the same time
(17:14) 300 is a lot wouldn't you agree I like how earlier she was like why do you have to make it an abuse analogy and then now
(17:21) she's like well what if she wishes oh no I just said I just said what about
(17:29) 200 250 I said how much leeway does it's not my fault you wouldn't answer the question I did I said that I don't mind
(17:34) yeah I said okay so 30 pounds I don't know what she would look like with 30 pounds more it's fine 30 pounds more
(17:41) would be okay he has just convinced me instead of leave the whales leave the orcas too oh my God leave the hippos I
(17:48) think chicken game at first I was just I was just gonna say whales and Wales is like 250 270 plus roughly but now I'm
(17:55) gonna add to it just because of you gotcha thank you would you leave your guy if he gained 200 pounds
(18:02) um oh my God the biggest cap no I I dated a guy that was a significantly bigger than
(18:08) me yeah would you know I didn't ask in your pastor saying right now would you date a guy and then he gained weight and he weighed 300 350 pounds
(18:14) uh three that's a lot no I wouldn't say you can leave the men whale too okay so male and female whales are getting dead
(18:21) I think it would depend on at what point in the relationship you are because if I'm like 70 and my partner gets really
(18:27) large for some medical reason I probably wouldn't leave them because I've built a whole life with them sure but not really
(18:32) as much of a problem but obviously at this point in my life I would because you want that attraction I feel like you're gonna lose it I do feel like once
(18:37) you have kids it's not about you anymore so I will say the kids if I had children
(18:43) I probably you know I'd be like go to the gym let's go running you know you
(18:48) know let's go 300 pounds I'll just I'll just start to feed him less you know what I mean I was like yeah it would
(18:54) depend on how they got to that weight right yeah like what things caused that to happen and other personality changes
(19:01) can I have a second plate I'll be like oh we're out of food that's you go to the McDonald's for you and your two kids
(19:07) you get three Happy Meals right I don't you
(19:15) I was like oh you know you might step out of another or whatever it's like okay well how much do you actually love your woman you're willing to do
(19:21) something like that like that has nothing to do with what about you like how much do you actually couldn't I say that to you don't you actually love your
(19:27) women if you're willing to step out on her well but we have the same rules yeah but it's not the same it's the same
(19:32) question see it's like he doesn't answer the question no I think it's if you have the same set of rules on both sides then
(19:38) it shows that you engage with the topic in a different way I don't associate the people that I have sex with I don't associate that with like hardcore love
(19:44) that's just for me that just doesn't work that way right that's I was gonna make your mom joke
(19:49) um no but the um yeah I was he's always bullied I am but but if you but if you
(19:54) believe that like love and sex go together and that's why your girl's not allowed to sleep around but you are that type of
(20:00) discrepancy is doesn't work for me I think women are like tie more emotion to sex than men do I think on like average
(20:07) probably okay so that's you wouldn't see why it's different then if you would agree that like by and large women tie
(20:13) emotion more to sex on average but the difference I don't think let me I'll let me answer your question before you
(20:19) railroad me down the well they engage with sex differently one in an open relationship they're actually okay appreciate the mocking okay
(20:27) mock you okay if you wanna lay out your whole Kingdom before
(20:32) being polite here um that's the same question I don't even
(20:37) remember so the question you're asking is if women and men engage with sex differently doesn't that mean it's okay
(20:43) for men to [ __ ] everybody and for women to [ __ ] nobody not say [ __ ] everybody I said different wouldn't you see that it
(20:49) is different there are probably some women that can engage with sex without it being a super emotional experience there are probably some men that can
(20:54) engage with sex that'll be a super emotional experience there's probably a few more men than women but I think both of them tie emotions and sex together
(21:00) pretty but well maybe when we have when we have these conversations though we're talking about the average we're not
(21:06) talking about the exceptions you were specifically asking about my
(21:11) relationship so I'm telling you for my relationship that was not a general question oh you're right you were right that's true God I love it when you say
(21:18) that oh thank you oh my goodness I need to stop August win that one that's gonna be my next donuts done okay oh no don't
(21:24) do it don't clip me do you love the person it absolutely does why because it requires you to step out of your own selfish realm of reference to see how
(21:30) your partner feels about something the only prioritize the things that you want in life that says something about how you view love of another person
(21:37) it's not really prioritizing it's just doing what you want to do yeah that's called being selfish so usually we do when you don't love somebody so they can
(21:43) get what they want but we can get first time he's going to considered that as a possibility it's like staring into the
(21:49) abyss he's like wait is he right what you want if you're dating women love selfish men though that's my problem
(21:57) Oh you just you just like say the randomness most like what is like the dumbest wrongest opinion yeah would you
(22:04) be with a selfish guy yeah why do you keep saying I've been with you're not anymore okay right selfish in which way
(22:12) yeah would you date a selfish guy I like guys okay when I say selfish I mean like
(22:17) guys that are following their purpose and put themselves first look at it oh okay and so it's it's like okay he's so
(22:24) ready I am good but I'm waiting for you see I'm like winding up my spring it's like it's like go ahead you scare me a
(22:30) little bit I'm like [Laughter] I forgot what I was even saying I forgot
(22:37) selfishness oh yeah I do come on what Tale As Old As Time We Know women love
(22:43) [ __ ] that's not true okay go ahead my question was gonna be
(22:48) let's say you start dating a guy and he's like listen I love you and I it's great what you're doing out here pearly
(22:54) but um I need you to move to Germany because that's where I live and I'm not moving anywhere for your career and let's say he earns like 60 000 Euro a
(23:01) year working in Germany and he's telling you you have to move there would that be like attractive to you like God he's so driven to just not care at all about my
(23:07) life I was gonna move to Germany next year anyways for volleyball yes I was like that wouldn't even be so bad
(23:14) Germany the German so I'm gonna like you totally avoiding that question I think we know the answer okay you asked if I'd
(23:21) moved to Germany for him and I said I was and then you said well I almost moved to Germany because I was playing volleyball which is a totally how about
(23:27) a country you wouldn't like I'm seeing so it was how about Zimbabwe [ __ ] your husband is from Zimbabwe
(23:34) answer carefully I just think long term that probably wouldn't work I don't want a woman Zimbabwe Hannibal they want to
(23:41) eat you it's not like both of you have Fair asks right but what we asked for is so small though compared to what other women to be
(23:47) disloyal to maybe knock another woman up to maybe step out of your girl and just start dating another how is that a small ass not only that bringing something
(23:53) back home yeah what STDs imagine you come home and you're and you're like oh [ __ ] I got another girl pregnant
(24:00) world of Agony there yeah see you know it's interesting I actually kind of
(24:05) agree with you there wow thanks oh another sound clip oh my God I'm gonna have so many domino sounds
(24:10) after this oh my gosh I don't know what a Dono sound is but I feel like I won't like it and he's just gonna make like when somebody donates money it like
(24:16) plays a noise so it'll be pearly saying like I agree with you oh my gosh don't do that
(24:23) um no um just so you do not consent yeah I don't I don't consent to that
(24:29) supposed to care about this oh you should have made better decisions so I'm sorry well we're all about
(24:34) accountability here now when it comes to like cheat I don't think cheating is ideal but I do think
(24:40) cheating is different for men and for women like I do think if you're gonna have like an open type relationship on
(24:46) either end that's going to cause more problems but you know I I do think it's different for men and for women
(24:53) are you smiling like that go ahead but like women aren't going to be okay
(24:58) with their guys cheating on them I don't know what else to say like it's it's so I just think if that was true
(25:04) every girl I ask this on the show wouldn't would it wouldn't stay and then leave later it's just quite odd true I
(25:11) think the same about abuse women all the time why don't you just leave now he's gonna bring him why don't you just leave
(25:16) why not just get out he's gonna bring abuse into this thing here is that and the reason why I I disagree and I get
(25:22) what I see where you're going with is saying that women have far more requirements therefore they love harder because those requirements are harder to
(25:27) find what I would you be with a guy if he cheated on you I think we already asked this yeah when
() 
(25:34) I'm just curious again did you say no um would it depend on the type of cheat
(25:40) imagine she had red her hair than you she was taller than you she had a better Studio
(25:46) um I mean I think it's dishonest to say I wouldn't okay I think it's dishonest to say I wouldn't
(25:52) um yeah okay I wouldn't I wouldn't be like Oh yay it
(25:57) wouldn't make you more competitive it might it might okay dude saying is that
(26:03) by having more requirements that makes that makes it where their love is a
(26:08) hundred percent contingent upon that man's performance so it's fleeting because if that guy loses right what he
(26:14) had that woman will leave and I've always said it that you know shout out to Rollo I agree with him on this women love opportunistically while men tend to love
(26:21) idealistically I think that one you already said that yeah I think the fact that they love opportunistically
(26:28) proves they're in itself what is loving that they love they don't love uh I mean it goes back for like loving a guy for
(26:35) what he has more so and it's not necessarily A Bad Thing
(26:40) um but maybe would that really be love who would it just be pretending I mean in the fresh and fit model of the world
(26:46) well what is love is the question in the fresh event model of the world women go after men for their resources and men go
(26:52) afterwards they don't make babies yeah but they don't say it's a bad thing like they're not they're not I'm just saying you could do that but
(26:59) also not be in love with them just you know well I don't even know they think women can love or it's just like a
(27:04) reptile brain like I mean I just think the art I think the argument is that women can't love in the same way that men can because like it requires more
(27:11) for us to love someone why can't you guys ever talk about I'm sorry not you guys because you're not a
(27:18) red Power I'm so sorry I almost said that but I get frustrated sometimes because the way that all of these people not you
(27:25) talk about relationships is so sad like it's like oh yeah like women are out
(27:30) here dating for resources and men are looking for the youngest freshest lowest body count woman and that's like all
(27:35) they have to say about relationships it's only sad if you look at it like that it's more of a description it's true it's not true for healthy
(27:42) relationships and it is sad if you care about relationships like who defines what is healthy like they're not saying what's healthy and what's not healthy
(27:48) they're just describing what it is and throughout all of time women have gone for men with more resources and men have
(27:54) gone forward and women that are younger and more pure they would have been dead yeah but because women couldn't work so
(27:59) of course they went up to resources because they're gonna work but I'm just saying that like if you if you think of like people that are in happy healthy
(28:06) relationships are you thinking of like God like she found a guy and it's just so cool because he gives her so many
(28:11) resources and it's so cool that he's like 48 and she's 22. you might not you might not like think of it like that
(28:18) right you might you might not think of it like that but it's true it's a description I disagree what do you feel
(28:24) like it's like an ingrained survival Instinct that we just have as women because we don't want to die so we like
(28:30) pick the guys with the most resources type of thing all right so I don't think it's only resources like muscles
(28:35) but that kind of looks like this if someone is like others if someone is physically fit that
(28:40) um suggests oh yeah yeah yeah so that's another resource yeah I think the most successful
(28:46) relationships require like a higher level engagement it requires more work um it requires like more types of
(28:54) um there are more things that go into building a healthy relationship between two people than just resources on one
(29:00) side and youth on the other like that relationship isn't going to last for more than like six months well I didn't say it was just resources but yeah I
(29:06) mean like I think there's things like culture values like that sort of thing too but I just think again it's a description it might not be as detailed
(29:13) of a description as you'd like but it's just it's just a description
(29:18) I don't know why you're saying it's just a description like that's kind of my point I said I disagreed with the description can you not disagree with
(29:23) the description yeah but how do you what do you disagree with you don't think women go after men with resources I don't think that it's that simplistic
(29:29) though and also there's a lot of a lot of the advice which is why I said well sure but if you're going to add in a whole bunch of stuff there right that's
(29:36) like saying like oh like women only date men with dicks they like and it's like well I don't know if that's true it's like well if they have a dick they like
(29:42) and also if they're like nice and they provide like a good life for them it's like okay well if you're gonna expand it way more well then sure I guess I agree
(29:47) so if you're gonna say like just resources and just youth then I I guess I'll agree if you're also going to add in on the other stuff I mean it just
(29:53) goes down to like the Bare Bones but then you can add in other like clearly yeah but those bears like this is more
(29:58) like marketing like those things draw you in we have like necessarily fall in love with those Bare Bones aren't going
(30:03) to sustain a relationship you're going to need more than just resourcing because what's going to happen but it starts with you you still
(30:10) need resources to start because women in general
(30:15) they well bum women do I wish that they didn't I know so many women in my life
(30:20) that could do so much better than they do yeah like why are you with these people if they could do better than they would exactly poor women can't poor
(30:27) women date poor men middle class women date middle class Richmond
(30:38) I think if they could do better they probably would I mean this is just based on me knowing that they're very
(30:44) attractive and the men that the weather just trash yeah because they end up getting obsessed with some dumb guy and
(30:49) then they do the yo-yo thing where they go back and forth forever they'll have something in common that bonds them really hard and then I'll be like you
(30:55) can do better and the commonality will be at one point the relationship was really good like a year or two ago and they're like chasing that relationship
(31:01) high for with some super loser dude for validation yeah men do they don't live
(31:07) idealistically they love based on I need this guy to perform something for me then I can love him whereas a man is
(31:13) like okay uh these are my requirements you're attractive you can cook just like we discussed before that's good enough for me and that guy will fall in love
(31:19) with her versus for her it's like you need to perform sure so for your question you could you give a good qualifier the analysis you're abandoning
(31:25) which is you don't believe in unconditional love nobody loves unconditionally yeah there's always nobody left right so what so if you're
(31:31) talking about like a man with very few requirements and you're going to say like well if you're not meeting the performance like a man to a woman then
(31:37) she's going to leave you well it probably is the same thing is true for the man as well right really so you
(31:42) think the average man would stay with a woman if she got like battery acid attacked and lost both legs or something that's not a condition
(31:48) I think okay I'm gonna tell you why I think you're wrong because the amount of whales
(31:57) I mean that's an exception though you know by and large men don't like fat chicks men stay with their fat wives all
(32:02) the time all the time are they all so fat yes Bolding yep there's a lot of fat people
(32:09) fat people stay with fat people but women by and large are fatter than men women and if you go in the U.S the
(32:14) woman's always fatter hold on I'm sorry isn't the average weight of a man like 40 pounds over the average weight of a
(32:20) woman yeah also men just statistics
(32:25) no I think the average weight of a woman is more than a guy I could be wrong I don't think you're right just because of the height difference alone right that
(32:31) would be insane but also there's just more men that are overweight yeah hold on I gotta look it up or
(32:38) whatever so in the U.S the average BMI for a man is 26.6 and the average BMI
() 
(32:43) for women is 26.5 oh I stand corrected and that means the men probably have 40 to 50 pounds more because they're taller
(32:48) right but I think it's just fat people stay with fat people there's always this like I feel like there's this it's so strange
(32:54) in these shows they present it as like poor women are going off and getting married to millionaire men that doesn't that's not happening and then like all
(33:00) these attractive men that are trying really hard to stay finished are having to settle for those like whale women I don't think that happens that's
(33:06) so common though it is I've heard I've seen so many girls get a
(33:12) ring and get fat like there's so many girls I went to high school with and there's guys that get a ring and get fat the guys just get like skinny fat like
(33:19) it's not I mean they're not in great shape and the women are getting skinny fat what do you mean oh no they're very fast okay there you go okay well the
(33:25) data on average says that everybody's about it and it's just the women on average they're all about as fat as each
(33:32) other like that's the status it still goes back to like the things that women value for men and men value from women
(33:40) looks than women it's more we agree with that right like women it's more just more so it doesn't mean there's nothing
(33:46) right but women it's more resources and Men it's more looks in in general the
(33:52) trend is changing but in general in general yeah okay it can be yeah okay I don't know how much it so I I do agree
(33:58) that women value resources but I think it's to a certain point right I don't I don't think it's like all women want
(34:03) millionaires yeah you're going to be realistic stable yeah you're gonna be realistic about what you can get not working at McDonald's like it's not that
(34:10) I don't think that it's as high but men's superficiality can get quite bad I don't know when I ask girls it's usually
(34:16) around like [Music] um in order they'll say in order to fully
(34:22) submit it's got to be like 90 to 100 here but they're going to work with like
(34:27) 60 to 70 roughly what what's the average here in the UK
(34:33) it's got to be like 35 or something right yeah that is exactly what I'm saying yeah but
(34:40) you're talking to exceptional people in your show right whether you're thinking or not they are these are believe it or not it's not bad
(34:46) if you want to have kids I feel like a lot of women that don't okay with a bit lower sure but I just
(34:51) like people are presenting it as like women that are making like 15 20 care only looking for guys making like six figures or more but the reality is poor
(34:58) people marry poor people you would be surprised if you look at the numbers poor people marry poor people middle
(35:03) class people married middle class people when do they marry them that's the whole point it's like the girls will go after
(35:08) the guys that make a lot of money in their 20s and their 30s get married to the guy that they because they want a
(35:13) kid no I don't agree with that I think that's a I think that's an artifact of women putting off marriage more because
(35:19) they're going to school they're working and they have birth control now now that's been spun into like they want to
(35:24) ride the cat the [ __ ] Carousel of like Chad dicks uh until they settle for a man but I think the reality is women are
(35:30) just in general putting up I mean you've never heard like women go for bad boys when they're younger like even my grandma would would tell you that
(35:42) but confidence and and the problem is a lot of [ __ ] are confident and it requires learning this process to be
(35:49) like I like confidence but I don't like [ __ ] but I have to date someone to figure out that's what they're talking
(35:54) about though so yeah but don't guys also so she's she's validating what I'm saying yeah I agree you go for dumb
(36:00) women when you're young but but yeah that dumb women no no guys make bad choices for women women tend to they
(36:06) have to learn that the confidence is what they like not the assholeness yeah I agree but it's not just women that do
(36:12) that it's men that do that too women go after dumb men when they're young but men but it's like every time
(36:17) we have a conversation about women you always have to put butt men because on your show
(36:23) five percent of the world's problems on so I'm saying yeah women do do this but men do it too it's not exceptional because my whole point is that like
(36:29) sorry men and women I think are way more in common we have way more commonalities so we do differences so like yeah but
(36:34) wouldn't you agree there's some biological differences no I think we're exactly the same
(36:41) yeah obviously biological different of course there are
(36:47) some biological there we make different types of mistakes I already told you earlier that like men are more likely to gravitate towards attractive women and
(36:53) women versus like men that have like money or whatever I don't think there's any commonality with women getting fat after they get a ring that's not a
(36:58) common I think everybody can let themselves go after they get around would you you think it's equal though yeah that's what the data seems to say
(37:05) okay otherwise the BMI of women would be way higher on average than the BMI of men no okay making it the extreme okay
(37:13) so what would happen to a woman that you wouldn't be with her anymore I guess if your standards are really low then maybe
(37:18) you wouldn't care but again this isn't a man versus woman this is a high standards versus low standard the only standards I need you to cook and I guess
(37:24) not cheat on me then sure I mean you can find a lot of people that'll fit the bill and then again like if if I and my
(37:30) partner are what are your standards uh I like people that are reasonably intelligent I like somebody has a high
(37:36) level of confidence um I prefer somebody that works like in my industry so that it's easy for us to communicate
(37:42) um I prefer somebody to be in an open relationship because I want to [ __ ] around um I like somebody that's pretty flexible so they're able to travel and
(37:47) adapt a lot because I do like a lot of crazy stuff I need somebody with a high degree of emotional tenacity because I
(37:53) have a lot of insane events that are going on in my life I need somebody that is really independent because I can spend time traveling or get really into
(37:59) my work um you know my I have a lot of there's a lot of weird stuff you have to deal with when you date me what about for you Pro
(38:05) yeah what are my standards yeah that no man has managed to meet yet let's hear
(38:11) it see if we can find you someone yeah your future husband could be listening to this show right now
(38:18) so tell him what you're looking for um I mean I like guys that are family
(38:23) oriented um I don't see I feel I feel like he's so ready to just
(38:29) there's no wrong answers here okay now um I like guys that are family oriented conservative
(38:35) um not I like you know I have a height thing he doesn't have to be taller than me he
(38:40) could be a little shorter but it can't be like crazy okay um all right
(38:45) yeah um family so just five eleven five
(38:51) conservative five nine five times five nine five ten okay conservative family
(38:57) oriented yeah you haven't found that guy yet [Laughter]
(39:06) like there's a lot of people I don't want to get into too much
(39:12) wow okay all right okay okay now I'm curious we got some weird requirements
(39:17) here secretly into BDSM oh yeah my side we're asked to describe why do
(39:24) we love each other and I say okay I really love my partner because she cooks really well and she's never [ __ ] another guy where we're dating and it's
(39:30) like okay and then she says oh well I love him because of this and that and that and that and that yeah who loves each other more that just seems like a
(39:36) weird it just seems like a weird thing to me like oh well I like her because of these two things literally every other woman I was gonna ask you all things
(39:42) being equal would you prefer it if it was like one-sided open or do you not care
(39:49) um if she did if she was cool with that if she was just like you know what that's totally fine I don't I I really don't I would be
(39:55) indifferent to it the reason why like if we're saying like in a perfect hypothetical world where there would never be a problem I still don't think I
(40:01) would character something I personally care about but I think that realistically anytime somebody's allowed to do something in a relationship and
(40:06) the other person isn't that's always going to build a lot of resentment I think you don't ever get jealous I'm just not that kind of person really no
() 
(40:13) the planet remember the question I said who who is closer to unconditional love oh I didn't hear that yeah yeah
(40:20) because I said because I said first okay unconditional love isn't realistic okay well in that case and the unconditional
(40:26) love is going to be the one with the lower standards so if you're a low-centered guy then sure yeah okay and
(40:31) I mean I I see that you switched the the point a little bit saying no like you know men women love more because they
(40:36) have more standards but my thing is who's closer to unconditional love and I would argue it's a men because we have far less conditions than women do sure
(40:43) well in that case the closest unconditional love will be people with like down or something right you see somebody you smile that's what he does
(40:49) he'll bring up like this random thing that's such a good counter-existence true just feel like this is we'll be
(40:55) like we'll be talking about A and B Down syndrome why not just to my kids we're talking about A and B and Destiny's like
(41:00) well what about C and you're like when we're talking about A and B what a great example uh that kid's gotta love so much
(41:06) that's an unconditional love right there just feed him pet him I don't know what you do with kids with Down Syndrome you
(41:11) know that's what you mean hey kid why do you have to say Down syndrome well because I I imagine they have less never
(41:18) mind I mean go ahead I mean kids they do say women are children a lot
(41:25) well red pillars do why that's weird because that's what they're looking for the perfect wife is a child you cannot
(41:31) you cannot tell me that the girls on the panel on the last panel we were on we're not acting like children you cannot tell
(41:37) me Charlie we're but I think a lot of the I'm gonna do the thing I think a lot of guys do too nah you can no I have
(41:43) done pan I am the only one in this space that have done panels equally men and
(41:48) women I've done full men panels I've done full women panels the women are absolutely worse wow they're absolutely
(41:53) worse you know if that's the if that's the idea
(42:01) but let's be honest here a lot of guys sure you know I would argue that women
(42:08) are far more selective than men and more intelligent when it comes to the mate selection process versus men are quite frankly a lot of the time stupid they'll
(42:15) be with a girl that is using them abusing them treating them like maybe yelling at them do you agree with that
(42:22) um I do partly I do think women are a little bit more intelligent with their selection after when they've grown a bit
(42:27) older I think maybe as teenagers we're equally stupid maybe they just learn a little bit faster I feel like I'd have a
(42:33) hard time generalizing because I see like I said you you know some I know some women that are insanely amazing
(42:38) people they look good and they're just with the most loser-ish guys I don't know why I can never explain it uh but I
(42:44) also know guys that will do like really dumb things over and over again too that should know better so people are real dumb sometimes when it comes to
(42:50) relationships yeah I don't know if I could generalize it more to one side or the other I don't know you can't generalize I just don't know I
(42:57) know a lot of men that make a lot of bad decisions I know a lot of women make a lot of bad decisions in terms of like who stays in relationships more
(43:04) um when dumb steps happening like how many Abused Women will stay in abusive relationships for a long time because they end up getting mind [ __ ] over it
(43:09) like I think that's stupid but you know the other thing I've learned about abused and what they don't
(43:15) talk about a lot of times they're both abusing each other that can't happen sometimes I mean like
(43:20) every because a lot of girls will come on my show and they'll be and I know you'll be like anecdotal like but okay
(43:26) I'm just like reactive abusing so they get abused they react back and then it's like a circle well but that's always the
(43:32) assumption but how do you know they didn't hit first I mean even if they even if they did hit
(43:37) first I think it's a bit different when a guy's hitting a woman unfortunately equal rights equal lefts baby
(43:43) I seriously I just I feel like if you shouldn't hit a guy if you don't expect to get hit back okay hold on weren't you
(43:49) earlier just saying there were by are you are there no biological differences between men and women yeah there are okay so women hitting men is bad I'm not
(43:57) going to argue against that it's a horrible thing and in relationships it shouldn't happen but I think men hitting women is a little different because the
(44:02) capacity to do damage there it's a lot higher well yeah so I feel like women then should never hit a guy I agree with
(44:08) you so it's like why would you hit a guy if you don't expect to get hit back and so in an abusive I think under the lot should be equal
(44:14) I don't even know what the question I think originally was who stays in abusive relationship and now we're trying to say that like well a guy
(44:20) should be able to beat the [ __ ] out of a woman is that a lot of times what they don't
(44:25) talk about is that they'll say oh women are staying with these abusive men but a lot of times the women are abusing too and if you talk to people that have
(44:32) actually worked in those Industries they'll tell you that I don't think so because the thing because that's usually
(44:37) a point that I have to fight on a lot of people when you talked in these industries the the repeated phrase is actually uh Mutual abuse is is
(44:43) impossible that's not a real thing they'll say that that's not that that back and forth doesn't exist I don't agree with that I think that Mo I think
(44:50) we saw it a little bit with the Johnny Depp Amber Heard stuff that there's like if any relationship that has some abuser probably both sides are doing symptoms
(44:56) if that happens to a man with money power and Status what happens to the average guy and that's the whole point
(45:01) that happens all the time wait hold on so so when we're when we are talking about where
(45:07) women women will abuse men and get away with it and it's really common and they'll say oh they were the one that
(45:13) abused me but they don't talk about that they're doing it too men abuse women and get away with it there's like relationships are hard should you always
(45:20) do is you always say but but because you're trying to make a point you're trying to make it it's like you're trying to make a point that's like women
(45:26) can get away with hitting men they do and men get away with hitting women everybody gets rid of hitting each other haven't you seen those social
(45:32) experiments where like a man will be screaming at a woman in public and then people will stop him and what like
(45:37) people will stop him and get involved in whatever and a woman will literally be beating up a guy in public and nobody
(45:43) stops nobody does anything if the question is is who can get away with abusing their partner in public then I
(45:48) would agree with you that people tend to call out men more than women or people tend to call it yeah however when it
(45:55) comes because it's not because when people are abusing each other privately when it comes time to hold somebody accountable or responsible it's really
(46:00) really hard to bring charges against somebody or go to the police station and Report anybody who's it harder for men
(46:06) or women it's probably for either oh Destiny come on there's a fair amount of
(46:11) crime that just isn't possible and it's almost impossible and it was a very lucrative I can't if yeah if you want to
(46:18) bring like a legal expert but I can't argue with like well I had a girl on my piano and she said this the reality is that when you go to the police station
(46:24) report even a rape you can do a full rape kit if it is only your word against somebody else's that case dies right
(46:31) there you can't but you can take pictures you can like they take pictures of like um if there's like cuts on them
(46:37) bruises like it doesn't necessarily mean you have enough forward it doesn't necessarily mean that but I'm I'm what
(46:43) I'm saying is that it's more common for women to be able to go to the police and get a conviction versus men going to the
(46:50) police and getting a conviction for women but I don't know if that's be hold on there's there's only one way you just
(46:56) don't go and report it or they back down there's also a lot going on with what you just said there to get a conviction is that's a different type of question
(47:03) because I mean let me send it there's even been cases where the a guy
(47:11) will call the police on a girl and they'll arrest him you've never seen those I mean okay a lot of the cases
(47:16) though the reason why this happens is because other men are not taking it seriously and the majority of the police force is still male okay
(47:24) why it's happening all my whole point is that it's harder for men okay in that capacity you mentioned get a conviction
(47:31) okay if men and women are biologically different if a hundred men attacked a
(47:36) hundred women and 100 women attacked 100 men and everything was perfectly reported and it was Flawless there was
(47:43) cameras recordings of everything in that perfect world wouldn't we still expect more men to get convicted
(47:49) because it's more gbh it's because it's more because it's a bit bigger power differential right if what if I'm gonna
(47:55) if I I would expect it to be if it's the same crime equal punishment that's what I would expect
(48:00) that if a woman punches if it's the same who cares about the
(48:08) damage it's the crime all the damage is results
(48:14) so if what about me and dust I'm a semi-pro athlete so it's like if I punch
(48:20) Destiny or destiny punches me why would it not be the same crime why would it not be the same prosecution
(48:25) why do women why do women do you want the actual answer you just want to keep asking like random questions
(48:31) why do you want women to get special treatment gotcha nice loaded question at the end there the reason why it's a
(48:37) different crime is because there's different intentions based on who's attacking who right if if a 16 year old
(48:42) girl that weighs 85 pounds starts running up and slapping me in the face she's probably not going to be ever like
(48:48) charged but like she'll get charged with assault and battery but it's not going to be like attempted murder or something right 250 pound man jumps on a woman and
(48:56) starts punching her in the face you might get charged with like attempted murder or something because the capacity to do damage there and the state of mind
(49:02) when you attack the person is going to be a lot differently if we acknowledge that there are biological difference between men and women which I thought we
(49:07) all agreed on I think we do then there's going to be a different intent behind a woman hitting a guy which I agree is
(49:12) still assaulting battery and I agree she still get charged for it and convict for it if you do it but the capacity for damage there shows a different state of
(49:17) mind than if a man attacks a woman do you agree that a man punching someone in the face carries with it a different intent than a woman slapping your guys
(49:23) excuses okay not triggered it's okay you're doing this you're just doing this excuses
(49:30) you're doing the thing the libs are always giving women excuses okay that's
(49:35) cool she's doing the thing that's right one thing in my life what thing am I doing a little bit easier what thing am
(49:41) I doing maybe ignore him he said anyways he's a trigger
(49:46) you can make this scenario move even for example the both using weapons that are
(49:51) the same then they would be charged this the same 100 then say uh
(50:01) like removing the aspect of the physicality of the human being you would then charge them based on the amount of
(50:06) damage that they've done with that well it depends like when you're talking about a weapon it depends on what you're doing right if you shoot someone in the head of the stomach you can just still
(50:12) charged with like attempted murder depending on what you were trying to do I'm in you know but I'm also like how hard is it going to be to like bring charges like let's say now we go to the
(50:19) world where we have less perfect information where I call somebody to the house 100 men 100 women we have the same thing we call somebody the house now you
(50:25) have a house where the guy got slapped police officers show up and maybe his face is a little bit red realistically
(50:31) like what do you can you even do battery at that point I don't know but if you show up to the house and then the woman is there and she's got like a broken jaw
(50:37) or her face is like severely [ __ ] up because the guy hit her well it's probably going to be easier to charge the guy there now that's not fair but
(50:43) again it comes down to like in the court system like what what can you charge and like what can you actually get a conviction on and oftentimes I don't
(50:49) know if women can do enough damage to men in general I'm not excusing them or saying it's okay or saying they can stab
(50:55) them or beat the [ __ ] out of them that's okay I think that's all horrible but in general men are going to do more damage that's going to be more easy to charge
(51:00) do you think do you think that they should be Char so you don't wait wait sorry so you don't think they should be
(51:06) charged the same for doing the same crime just yes if they do the same crime they should be charged with the same thing
(51:12) yeah so we agree no we don't agree because I don't think you know what crime means the same crime but also same results if
(51:19) you and you punch me and I punch you shouldn't we be charged the same maybe but that's because you're a you're
(51:25) a small lady okay if you but if me and Kelly punch each other there's probably a different thing oh my gosh so I don't even get the specials
(51:32) want special treatment but not for conservative women true not not for tall
(51:38) crowd volleyball playing conservative family not for conservative women play games dude you there's a girl that you
(51:44) hook up one time right and then she'll play games then you got to move on to the next girl whatever like girls are very fickle and Flaky like she like you
(51:51) now then her boyfriend hits her but her ex-boyfriend hits her back up and then she starts talking to him and she's out the roster like you girls drop off all
(51:57) the time I agree kind of but I think that's because guys play a lot of [ __ ] games too because guys will run
(52:02) into girls that are playing games but it's because they're playing games get in their DMS oh yeah we can chat like it was so much fun hanging out with you
(52:08) like I really enjoyed it like let's hook up again tonight and then you hook up you bust and you're like I got [ __ ] I gotta do in the morning like can you
(52:13) take off or whatever and then yeah of course like girls have to play games because guys are playing the same [ __ ] game I think if you're upfront
(52:18) your eyes excusing the women you're always excusing the women you're like oh women only play games because of the men
(52:25) like what if you want to tell me the accountability if you want to have a look at look at I've I've had guys play
() 
(52:33) games with me if I play games back that's on me it's not because of him you're either someone that plays games
(52:38) or you're not someone that plays games you don't have to play play games because of who you're dating sorry go
(52:44) ahead go ahead [Laughter]
(52:58) if you want to have a healthy view of the world that allows you to understand the world well and navigate the world
(53:05) well that is important how do you define what's healthy sorry go ahead then it's important to understand why things are
(53:11) the way they are and then to act accordingly if you're one of these far left people and you blame men for
(53:16) everything then you miss how much dumb [ __ ] women do cause men to do stupid things but if you're over on this side
(53:22) and all you do is blame women for everything then you miss all the dumb things that men do that cause women to act the ways to do so it's good who says
(53:28) I don't know that men do dumb things didn't I ask you like two nights ago um
(53:34) for like what did I ask wasn't it one question like can you name me something bad that like uh bad that men do that is
(53:39) doesn't like a woman didn't you have like not a single answer that do you remember this question why did you ask I don't I don't remember I felt it was two nights ago but it
(53:46) feels like on the red pill space every problem is because of women women are their standards are too high they're on
(53:51) Instagram getting flown to do by all the time and men are like these they're they're cast as these downtrodden Warriors that are getting divorced at
(53:57) ultra high weights from rates from women and their children are being stolen from them and they're trying to do all these things they're just like poor men and
(54:03) it's like no reality is everybody [ __ ] with everybody everybody's doing dumb [ __ ] we should hold everybody accountable we should talk about the
(54:08) things going on on both sides it's really dumb and any complicated dating or relationship interaction to only analyze one side of things and then say
(54:14) that it's the only person that is having a problem
(54:30) just to say that um men do dumb things too are you happy
(54:36) thank you yeah that's another thing donation alert but if you do something dumb you shouldn't blame it on someone
(54:41) else if you do something dumb that's on you so if a woman's gonna do dumb [ __ ] I'm not gonna blame it on the men I'm
(54:46) gonna say no you you did something dumb okay that's great but that type of analysis is pointless you don't need anybody to say you did something dumb
(54:53) but the deeper understanding should be why do people do dumb things did it you said you just said you just said that
(55:00) women were playing games because of the men that is what you said yeah because I want to understand why are people doing
(55:06) dumb things not because they chose to do dumb things that's a stupid of course if you're gonna give someone an outcome
(55:12) that's not an excuse me out to play it on someone else like why are you with
(55:17) guys that play games that's on you somebody might molest kids because they were molested as a kid that's not an out that's not an excuse to do it that's
(55:23) what he does third party extreme example this is like the now he's gonna bring up child
(55:29) molestation when we're talking about games it's like all right let's skip to
(55:35) the end she's like I have better things to do and you're like yo you wanna that's all
(55:42) I'm going to that's all I'm looking for whatever and she's either like yeah sure or no that will that that's like don't all say
(55:48) that is absolutely nothing wait if you're clouded up on [ __ ]
(55:53) YouTube it doesn't work man you girls want your time they don't want they don't want easy sex we want us if you
(55:58) want to roast Destiny I'm gonna read all the super chats that roast him and none of the ones from his fans that are

(56:28) then do you want to bet right now that you couldn't go into your Instagram DMs I know you could find it yeah and a
(56:35) girl's hitting you up okay there are girls on this panel that you can [ __ ] tonight that's with little to
(56:41) no effort Destiny easy I get what you're saying but at the same time it's a numbers game
(56:48) yes it's one thing yeah actually showing up had not saying I don't know how I feel about this can we go on a date like
(56:54) they're gonna change because it's the guys trying to [ __ ] it up don't do anything creepy don't do anything [ __ ] weird as long as you're [ __ ] it
(57:01) up it's usually not that hard to land Destiny I can tell you have no experience with it
(57:06) I can't believe he said that why did you throw it in there why did you throw them all under the bus but all these women
(57:12) would [ __ ] you as well because it's true unless you're that's why I don't I don't want to talk [ __ ] what no go ahead go
(57:18) ahead go talk [ __ ] talk [ __ ] if you are a decently clouded guy you should be able to get no strings attached to sex
(57:24) from random people that's just a fact yeah that's true but these guys say that they can't none of them can do it look
(57:31) at something but you're looking at like top like what percent of cloud are they in that's what no no but that was my point but they're but they're saying
(57:37) like sneako look they're saying sneako and Myron couldn't just [ __ ] a girl no strings attached maybe they have like really little I mean no man has Heist
(57:45) that's not that's a myth that men say on the internet to make them feel better about them and they don't know how do
(57:50) you know do they [ __ ] whales in the sign is this one never say anything about that I didn't say anything I didn't say
(57:56) any of that hello where is King riches he would agree with me he said there's anything okay there's a there's a roast
(58:01) of you oh yeah go ahead Destiny you're the little bro that sides with Mom during the divorce even though she broke
(58:07) up the family cheated and Etc wow I have another one I hope she had a college degree don't roast me because I'm not
(58:13) gonna read it Destiny is the NPC in a video game that is below the signif the level of significance of the main
(58:20) character also you can't roast her I won't read it wow yeah you can I don't
(58:26) mind I'm sorry
(58:32) there are like 20 girls right now that I could fly out if I wanted to tonight and never see them again and they'd be
(58:37) totally cool with it but that's because I'm super up front right at the start when I talk to people I'm [ __ ] married I'm never [ __ ] dating you but
(58:43) like we could be friends oh my God I'll chill we can do it and I know there are other guys that are super clouded up on YouTube that can do it as well but when
(58:48) you guys are planning these weird how many girls in each City could you do that with that are like decently attractive like no whales don't count no
(58:55) like sub fat like like cute cute and up in each City this is a lose-lose conversation for me
(59:02) because it's because it's going to look like it's gonna it's just weird I'm not saying you would I'm saying could I'm
(59:08) just curious I'm a decently famous person I think there's a person that's decently attractive that I could
(59:13) probably have sex with any City it's a fan of mine but that but but
(59:20) the function of being like okay clouded guys get a lot of pushes well but these guys
(59:26) that are in your DMs listening just a little bit I'm just curious well I will say though the girls that I tend to hang
(59:33) out with though can also be kind of [ __ ] insane so but yeah I know right I'm not but that's okay you know that's
(59:38) all right
(59:47) then she's with me and him it can bury you we're just saying okay in slow night you're chilling with the boys she's
(59:53) available all right good to go where'd they saying live bro I'm gonna be very simple about this in
(1:00:00) the 1970s there was a study done where when when women were straight up proposition for sex it was a 95 failure
(1:00:05) now let's go ahead and status and clout to it okay that might lower the chances to maybe a 90 or an 85 based on who the
(1:00:12) guy is but you got to understand that there's multiple points of failure when you deal with a woman for sure hey Wanna [ __ ] sure next day changes I don't know
(1:00:19) how I feel about this and then she then she comes over to your place do you mind if we go on a date oh no oh like girls
(1:00:24) change their mind based off how they feel that's true do you agree with this did you hear that that's like a cold
(1:00:30) feet example I half agree but it's because they're probably [ __ ] it up maybe maybe well I mean but you see your
(1:00:36) eyes putting it on the mat it also could be like we're at a different point in our cycle and we just don't feel like it because I might can I it might let me
(1:00:43) know when you're done and I'll explain how this transaction works I'm gonna give you I'm gonna time you okay ready hold on not not yet calculate I would be
(1:00:51) way too anxious to just [ __ ] someone over Instagram jams that's fine people terrify me know how to get the timer on
(1:00:57) caught up in a suitcase oh I'm ready okay go ahead okay women tend to have
(1:01:02) more at risk and a hookup than a guy does the woman has decided that she wants to [ __ ] you that's conditional on everything going right now as long as
(1:01:08) you don't do anything creepy weird stupid rapey or whatever generally you can bring things home but if the girl comes over and your place looks weird or
(1:01:15) you act weird or you're too touchy or you push too much you make a creepy joke or something is off there's a lot of chance you can lose at that point in the
(1:01:21) interaction So when you say women change your mind a lot I guess they can but I feel like some guys make it seem like randomly like women like oh well I don't
(1:01:27) want to [ __ ] you now because the [ __ ] moon is not in the [ __ ] Sagittarius position when in reality Chancellor you probably did something to mess it up
(1:01:33) um 30 seconds 35 I was 30 you took five seconds
(1:01:40) I'll give you 32. 34. um I think you're partially wait wait
(1:01:45) wait wait wait wait don't answer it hold on I'm gonna time you now it's crazy I don't talk as much as you I
(1:01:52) don't you know what's crazy I was on his stream okay and then he was
(1:01:58) like don't interrupt me and I was just like he had been talking the whole time I watched the video back whole time
(1:02:03) um see I don't like the timer no keep going were you gonna respond to my point no okay I agree with you partially that
(1:02:09) sometimes the guys mess it up but also it's based on how we feel and sometimes random things that make no sense mess it
(1:02:15) up and it's nothing to do with the guy okay 21 seconds yeah see always less than you what was what is a random thing
(1:02:21) the point we're getting here there can be a lot of variables that's true so what is a random thing that messed it up
(1:02:28) um they're not over somebody else and they get copy yeah that's actually really true so that's that's something
(1:02:33) yeah your ex texts you
(1:02:39) okay I mean you asked for a variable there you go so that has nothing to do with you that would have nothing to do
(1:02:45) with the guy that's not the guy messing it up in any way but a girl's like X could text her and then she's like oh maybe
(1:02:52) I guess I've never had that happen in my life I guess that you know but you don't know why the girl's saying no and like a
(1:02:58) lot of times there's reasons like guys don't even know okay I
(1:03:05) disagreement are a little bit different than probably the ones that you talk to right so that might be why you're yeah maybe it's very true because I'm up
(1:03:12) front Okay that's why I'm not playing games yes sure okay they don't want to feel like so if you say what the [ __ ]
(1:03:17) she might say yes up front then when it's time to actually do it she changes her mind so what I'm saying is that there's multiple points of failure when
(1:03:24) you deal with a girl girls flake a lot girls I'm curious have you guys ever there's three guys in here have you guys
() 
(1:03:30) ever had a girl yeah I'm asking everyone have you ever had a girl sleep in your bed and not do anything with you
(1:03:37) yeah it's happened yeah yeah so you wouldn't say that's like a girl changing your mind last minute
(1:03:42) um no she can I'm not saying it's impossible no yeah but so that's that's what he's saying I think and it's kind
(1:03:47) of validated by the fact that everyone in here that's happened to you now what I'm disagreeing with is I don't think
(1:03:52) it's like a random thing I think you have a lot of control over it as a guy that doesn't mean it's gonna be 100 mm-hmm
(1:03:58) do you think it's random random um I think a lot of women won't necessarily
(1:04:04) be confident with someone that they've literally just met so I mean that you could know them I didn't ask any of them
(1:04:10) how long they knew the girl um yep but if if we're talking like it this is a hookup so I mean if you've
(1:04:16) known them longer especially friends they're more likely to be like yes than if we're just dming someone because I
(1:04:23) think the the context is them being DMV random girls on their Instagram yeah so
(1:04:29) there is the potentiality for that to just them get cold feet change their mind
(1:04:34) feel this way they feel that way a guy hits them up boyfriends them up they're on their period there's so many different uh variables that could come
(1:04:41) in that bucket up for you now get what you're saying yo just proposition them be honest with them that doesn't work for most guys sure I'll say the you'd
(1:04:48) agree with that right that won't work yeah I've never said last thing I'll say and you can do whatever it is I agree
(1:04:53) with you that women will play games but more often than not just from the DMS that I've seen from the people women and men that I talk to it's usually because
(1:05:00) the guys are playing games too if you're up front you might get shut down immediately what do you mean by like the guy what games are the guy is playing so
(1:05:06) oftentimes women are trying to select for people that aren't just for an immediate hookup so the games that guys
(1:05:11) play as they try to present themselves to something that's not just looking to hook up but they are and then as soon as they get it then they disappear
(1:05:18) so like if I'm hitting at people when I was in California when I was on Tinder more or if I'm chatting the person I'm usually pretty upfront they're like I'm
(1:05:23) looking for something casual maybe very short term maybe just a hookup and then like they're either into it or they're not and then we figure it out from there
(1:05:30) but if you start like oh like I really like your pictures I think you're really cool and blah blah blah and then you deal this and then you hook up and then
(1:05:35) you like disappear you're like playing a game yeah I think that saying I like your pictures is playing a game
(1:05:40) are you I'm getting sucked in because of how dense you're collapsing into a black
(1:05:45) hole because of how dense you have to be to have taken from that whole explanation that all I was saying was
(1:05:51) saying you like your pictures is leading somebody on I'm sorry oh my God you're about to collapse into a black hole
(1:05:57) I was just thinking that I was just thinking that the bar is pretty low for a game of the games if that was the only
(1:06:03) thing I said Pearl I would agree with you oh my God that was a low bar Big Ups Big Ups bar for playing yeah
(1:06:11) get on the internet a lot longer than me so I think there's like things that you say that I just don't understand that's
(1:06:17) a London phrase right there no big UPS don't do that King Richard said it like 20 times
(1:06:22) oh my God how many of these do we have how long is this one it wouldn't be so long if you'd shut the [ __ ] up
(1:06:30) Jesus Christ that's why I didn't want her to come on this is why I told her to knock him
(1:06:35) yesterday okay okay can I come on your Twitch stream oh yeah
(1:06:42) you guys have so much fun she does this thing it's called body painting you would love it okay body painting oh you
(1:06:47) got you can do it together it would be so cute you'll love it it's so good I think I'm
(1:06:53) not gonna like it you'll love it a little bit of a differentiation it'll be really good fine fine oh did
(1:06:59) she commit it to it you heard it guys good luck I'm not fine I won't go on no no she doesn't seem to want to oh no no it's okay it'll be fun don't worry no I
(1:07:06) don't I didn't know the bottom hit anyone I thought she was just a streamless player the same
(1:07:17) I'm trying to click it it's not going there are people on the right that are willing to speak some uneasy truths that
(1:07:23) people on the left just won't acknowledge and as long as you're not willing to acknowledge something it's true you're going to lose to the people
(1:07:28) that I just like to say defending conservatives once again wow Destiny always defending College what's true I
(1:07:35) think that red pillars will make some observations that are true and then they get wild with it and they go off into
(1:07:41) these crazy places where it's like I understand where you're starting from but the places that you go you could go in such a better direction is educate
(1:07:47) good for for the guys or not I'd say absolutely not I think that the idea of masculinity and success and fulfillment
(1:07:54) that's being sold by a lot of people on the right I think leads to the same type of spiritual Wasteland that you're
(1:08:00) trying to like pull these young men out of I would say like when I look at somebody like Andrew Tate or even like for you guys or anybody that talks about
(1:08:06) red pill stuff it always feels like you're big markers for Success are how many women can you get how much money can you make what kind of cars do you
(1:08:12) drive and at the end of the day I just I don't know how old you guys are but like when I think back to the things I've had in my life like I don't like remember
(1:08:18) the third you know new iPhone I got I don't remember like when I got my new car like it was cool for like a week but like there are memories that you make
(1:08:24) with other people there are things that you achieve or accomplish in your life for Me Maybe stuff related to music maybe stuff related to gaming when I was
(1:08:29) in Esports like these are the standout memories that I have but I never hear anybody in like the red pill Society building towards that it always feels
(1:08:35) like they're building towards like the most hollowed existence that you possibly could have as a man that gets like signed off by mainstream consumer
(1:08:42) Society you've applied that a lot to me but I've never even really talked about that and even if I do I want the ability
(1:08:47) to buy those things it's not those things are going to make me happy I just want to have the power tell them sneako or to not be restricted by anything I
(1:08:54) guess the argument Big Ups to sneako Big Ups I'm with the signs
(1:09:00) I want to be rich out here speaking facts dunking on Destiny big point I
(1:09:06) always make is if you spend all of your life trying to get the capability to have everything right like a man who
(1:09:12) spends his whole life on the mission once that mission is fulfilled he has nothing because your whole life you've just spent trying to get stuff right and
(1:09:18) you haven't worked on building relationships building friendships accomplishing something real the best type of advice you get from red pill is
(1:09:23) at least working out as long as you're doing it for yourself and not to impress a chick but like because building your body means something right you don't prove something you get money I don't
(1:09:29) know I don't think that's that important I think that there are like upgrades to your life you can make if you're making 15 000 a year and you live with your mom
(1:09:34) and dad yeah you need to up your money of course but like if you've got a decent job and I've seen this as a millennial there's a lot of people from
(1:09:40) my generation who are sitting in their apartment making 140 000 a year doing work from home who hate themselves they
(1:09:46) have no friends except for the ones that they see light up on Discord they have no Hobbies except for the 4 000th game of League of Legends they play for the
(1:09:52) day and they have like no fulfillment in their life they have nothing and these are the types of people no also
(1:09:58) why do you let that Destiny talk so much Pro why do you let that Destiny talk so much you just talk for like two minutes
(1:10:04) and you didn't say anything because I felt like you were tight on time like I felt like you've been sitting oh my God
(1:10:10) oh my God I was trying to get the video in the videos okay the video go you're
(1:10:16) doing a good job farming over there Kelly congratulations okay what is farming she's farming right now what does farming mean she's saying she's
(1:10:23) saying things that she knows again are brownie points with the audience tour with you she's farming okay I played a
(1:10:30) lot of League of Legends as well right we know she's we're both uh survivors she's doing a good job I'm on her team
(1:10:37) okay yeah like how do I meet girls how do I meet friends like why is it that I've hit every big marker in my life but
(1:10:43) I'm miserable and I think that that void isn't being answered by anybody I think right now so Destiny do you believe in
(1:10:48) the hero's journey like the Greek archetype or whatever yeah I mean I believe it's a story and to some extent it's applicable to our lives yeah of
(1:10:54) course so to me from what I see Andrew doing he's giving you the hero story he's been through hardship you know he was poor not successful he worked his
(1:11:00) way up he said you know what speaking facts fresh well if I could scan this way to the top yeah how did he scan his
(1:11:06) way to the top his whole business was scamming men what what business what do you mean camming that whole business was scamming
(1:11:12) men Oh I thought you're talking about fresh oh no I was talking about he's talking about Andrew Tate about
(1:11:17) oh scamming your weight at the top oh you can too as well would you agree on that or no with these guys okay these
(1:11:23) guys are on the Titanic and there's one Lifeboat that can hold 400 people and there's 10 000 people on the deck and
(1:11:28) they're like everybody can get in this boat that's not true anybody could get in the boat but not all 10 000 of them were getting in okay when you've got
(1:11:34) like a podcast where guys are talking about but don't you think we should strive to get in the boat like you should tell people to strive for it
(1:11:39) doesn't mean everyone will get it I think we should probably teach people to swim what
(1:11:46) I don't get it I'm sorry I think accepting the circumstances you're in teaching everybody to swim would
(1:11:52) probably be better than trying to get 10 000 people and afford a person Lifeboat teach people how to deal with life as it comes rather than saying you could be
(1:11:57) the exceptional one percent because 99 of people are going to meet that market why wouldn't you tell people to like do what you did because most of them fail
(1:12:03) you're the exception yeah but I understand that yeah but not everybody can yeah but I think I think everybody
(1:12:09) can find something that contributes to society and they can do well at it yeah but not all of those jobs are going to
(1:12:14) be highly like uh compensated you're going to be exceptionally depressed if you failed
(1:12:19) um it's good to have just exercises but that doesn't mean you can't push yourself I think I think you think you do
(1:12:26) anything I like genuinely believe I can do anything that's that it must be what
(1:12:31) a fun background you know no yeah I'm serious I just don't understand I
(1:12:36) believe you I believe you feel that way I don't understand in the position you're in why you wouldn't encourage people to get into your position it's
(1:12:41) like he wants to be the only one in the position because disappointment comes in your life when you have a difference between
(1:12:47) the expectation and the reality of a situation if you're selling somebody that you want to try to be the next big YouTuber the next big star do you know
(1:12:53) how many people buy like the brand new computers the brand new overlays they get all their stuff set up and then they stream for like six months to two
(1:12:59) viewers like it's not healthy to put somebody in a state of mind where like you have to go for the top one percent or else
(1:13:04) you're nothing you're a loser you haven't made it it's better to teach people like how can you excel at areas in life that will make you happy you
(1:13:10) don't need to be like a massive Superstar I'm saying it doesn't mean they'll get to where you get but taking
(1:13:16) advice from you could help them get there maybe they don't get I don't know how many followers you had on Twitch or
(1:13:22) famous generally not considered a something that people strive to for but they think other people strive for and
(1:13:30) it can kind of you don't think people strive for fame I think a lot less people do than the people that think
(1:13:36) others all want it it's the least thing that people actually end up wanting but obviously with Fame there comes money
(1:13:42) and other things you get from it but the actual things but my whole my whole point is that he's in a position a lot of people would want to be in like
(1:13:49) you're successful like you have you've been on the internet for 10 years like that's a huge accomplishment 12 years but okay no I'm serious so many people
(1:13:56) come and go even like when you're here I'm asking you questions because I think it's cool how long you've been on the internet like not a lot of people can do
(1:14:02) that I think so I just would not like I just stress here no I I understand he's
(1:14:08) a special person I understand that too but I'm saying like why wouldn't you want to encourage people to get to where you're at because I feel like you're
(1:14:14) going to keep asking me this is so exceptional at it you're gonna keep asking me the same question because you don't like the answer to me but I'll say
(1:14:19) it again if I have a hundred thousand people listening and I give tips on how to reach my position maybe 20 or 30 of
() 
(1:14:25) them maybe could like hit something similar why would I do that instead of talking to all 100 000 we're like here are things that you could do to have a
(1:14:31) happier life like I feel like I'd rather do that because realistically not everybody could be in the top one percent of any of every industry or
(1:14:38) whatever right yeah but it's like you might they might not hit where you've hit but they could still improve from
(1:14:44) where they're at no no no okay okay for being a streamer
(1:14:52) there it's a little bit of a binary you either make it or you don't if somebody puts aside like six months of their life
(1:14:57) to try to get into streaming and they don't get more than two viewers it's not like oh well at least I improved myself a ton because I was like on the journey
(1:15:02) like there's no Journey it's like going for like professional sports right if you throw your whole life into volleyball or basketball or whatever and
(1:15:09) it doesn't work out and you don't even get like good you know like NCAA spots well I mean like what do you have to show for it's like well you know at
(1:15:14) least I was on the journey like well no now it's like okay I need to go back and like figure out what I actually do with my life now right I mean you still have
(1:15:20) skills a little bit but it's like but but you could have been building in so many other ways right I think it's
(1:15:25) better to have like a solid foundation for a life so some type of like decent job that gives you money and then from
(1:15:31) there build out the things that we know make people happy have a good sleep schedule have a good diet get a little
(1:15:37) bit of exercise and have like friendships reptile encourages all of that that like the self-improvement
(1:15:42) stuff like they encourage them to have a good sleep schedule have a good diet go to the gym like and you agreed with that earlier I but it feels like the
(1:15:48) self-improvement has a vein angle to it all the time and that's the issue right you don't like the vein the vanity I
(1:15:54) don't get it because the vanity is a different type of improvement right like you could see people that get lost in
(1:15:59) certain things they get obsessive over certain things because they didn't chase it for the right reason right if you're working on these four pillars because you want to make yourself into a happy
(1:16:05) healthy person that's fine but if you're doing this because you hope you get a Bugatti in 10 years it's it's got it takes on a different character well I
(1:16:11) don't understand why that's a bad thing to want to get a Bugatti because of your life I kind of understand where you're
(1:16:16) coming from in a way because like like my parents were always more I mean we
(1:16:22) always had nice like houses or whatever but like they we weren't into designer clothes we weren't into like typically like rich like my dad drove
(1:16:28) the same car for 20 years like I understand like modesty with that stuff but at the same time like if you're
(1:16:34) gonna tell a 20 year old kid just try to get a Bugatti I just don't see anything wrong with that because things don't
(1:16:40) make you happy in a fulfilling sense nobody's bought a thing that's made them happy for a long time things make you
(1:16:45) happy for days or maybe a couple weeks very short term but if you're building on like friendships and relationships
(1:16:51) some of those things will last for your entire life and it just feels weird to me that in a way there go ahead
(1:16:57) experiences too go ahead go ahead I'm sorry meeting doing things
(1:17:05) I think the hyper liberal attitude of the West has driven people into a sort of like spiritual kind of like
(1:17:10) destitution to where people feel like they don't have very much meaning or purpose in life and part of that and it
(1:17:15) can be laid on the doorstep of capitalism or more specifically hyper consumerism by this phone buy this watch
(1:17:22) buy this car and red pillars have correctly identified that there's a lot of like purposeless like men that don't
(1:17:27) feel like they have much going on in life but then they take them and they you know they they do some weird calculus to throw them right back into
(1:17:33) that rat race of like okay now that you're here okay forget these liberal loser World Order guys or whatever we're
(1:17:39) gonna have you guys going to the gym and getting ripped and getting so you can get posted and get money so you can get a lot of cars I was like that's like the same Capital [ __ ] you just left behind
(1:17:46) right especially when those guys talk about capitalism is has a political leaning right there's plenty of liberals
(1:17:51) that have lots of expense things well sure but I'm just saying that like um because in capitalism yeah and
(1:17:56) capitalism the goal is just selling more things with materialism is a good thing yeah but you can argue that a
(1:18:03) capitalistic mindset drives like a hyper consumerist hyper materialist mindset right
(1:18:08) here's how you become a millionaire doing this without that yeah maybe there's like some percentage your audience could do it but 98 of these guys are going to fail and we everybody
(1:18:14) knows that from the dawn of any multi-level marketing any online type of advertising any like encouragement to
(1:18:19) like get rich doing these things like these goals are for 98 of people totally unattainable can anybody do it probably
(1:18:24) can everybody do it absolutely not a lot of people you say can anybody do it probably oh see you kind of anyone can
(1:18:31) do it he he just he contradicted himself I think he means so anyone can try but the
(1:18:37) majority will not succeed I think good job Kelly yeah so anyone can do it I think that anyone
(1:18:43) can okay on the left for whatever dumb [ __ ] reason are really scared of self-improvement like I'm reading
(1:18:49) articles from The New York Times saying that like you know workout culture has been taken over by the right at least he realizes there's a bunch of weirdos on
(1:18:56) the left yeah thank you I appreciate that with the right have a monopoly on improving your body what a stupid thing
(1:19:02) meanwhile I go to the left and I'm seeing like Health at a recession I'm like oh well that's why me I guess you know I genuinely wholeheartedly believe
(1:19:09) if you're a fat it's your [ __ ] fault and you deserve zero sympathy the thing thank you Myron I agree
(1:19:17) at number 15. let's go there are also medical illnesses that they genuinely call this guy what a smart guy this is
(1:19:25) it like the core of that messaging is correct because of their poor choices you should
(1:19:30) love it because of the genetics and the hormones or their poor choices fighter no no I'm saying for the people that are
(1:19:37) medically are you gonna let her get away with that what I mean Diabetes Type 1 for example is like an auto Moon and
(1:19:42) disease and you can't control autoimmune disease okay but she's going to talk about the exception rather than the rules yeah yeah no I'm only talking
(1:19:48) about people with actual movies okay I'll give you like half a percent of the population I'll give you point zero you think only half of the percentage of the
(1:19:54) population has diabetes uh base yes and that should be the big drive to improve it even if you are overweight you can
(1:19:59) still love yourself you don't have to hate yourself and that should be like the big drive that's pushing you you should hate yourself a little bit
(1:20:05) back towards being a healthy person but somehow somewhere along the way that got convoluted or warped into well you're
(1:20:11) healthy and you love yourself and we can't be having any problems with ourselves we love ourselves so if you love yourself nothing can be wrong with you therefore you're perfect the way you
(1:20:16) are and then don't work on anything and that's what's happened with so many of these left-leaning narratives is that they also send super chats to roast
(1:20:22) Destiny at the end off I guess kind of like the right ones where like the central idea I think is good those reasons for why people are in the areas
(1:20:28) they are suddenly become justifications or rationalizations to never improve anything agree and yeah now the
(1:20:34) explainer for why you are where you are has become the handicap of the crutch that's preventing you from succeeding there's a quote just because one side
(1:20:41) airs too far does it really follow that the other side couldn't be airing too far as well and that's kind of how I
(1:20:46) feel it like the left is right away for sure but that doesn't mean that the right has the correct answer you're in
(1:20:51) the middle if you were born middle class and you're middle class your whole life you didn't accomplish you showed up to
(1:20:56) life every day and you did fine you went to school you went to college and you got a job and that's great but those same people that started middle class
(1:21:02) and ended up middle class we'll look at people that are lower class and these people will stay lower class and they'll
(1:21:07) look down on them and it's like why hold on you didn't improve your lot in life at all do you think that people that
(1:21:12) start lower class and get to upper class have a right to look down on Lower Class people because they came from it and did
(1:21:19) it I don't think you should look down on anyone okay but would you know no okay so no one can look down at anyone you
(1:21:25) don't look down on anyone never never because I'm so sure that's a bit
(1:21:30) I feel like everyone looks down on people yeah not me okay I'm a saint are you lying right now no I'm not lying
(1:21:37) like this is the man that was bullying me oh you stayed the same the whole time why would you look down at a guy you
(1:21:43) know who's making 24K a year who came from a family of people making 24K a year it's not like you're a millionaire now and you had every right to be right
(1:21:49) because if you were born middle class in America in the United States of America the [ __ ] world is at your fingertips people on the right will I agree you do
(1:21:57) have the world at your fingertips but I'm making the bad argument you're agreeing with a bad argument that I'm making being born in America being born
(1:22:04) in America you have so much opportunity then why did you come to the UK to get rich I actually no I didn't mean to I
(1:22:12) don't even like being okay careful careful hear that I'm sorry I don't like the UK
(1:22:17) um I I came here to play volleyball that's where I came and then I started it and everything blew up I was supposed to that's I was supposed to move to
(1:22:23) Germany volleyball stupid like yeah I think family is really important and you know like my grandpa my great grandpa
(1:22:29) and [ __ ] like you know the contributions they made to my parents that really helped me in life and then they'll turn around and say some [ __ ] like I don't think Jim Crow matters that was in the
(1:22:35) 60s like bro this family doesn't have a house because they weren't allowed to live in this part we're not saying that a lot of stuff has changed in the world
(1:22:41) with regard to technology everybody in the left wants to blame like the patriarchy and racism and then people on the right want to blame feminization of
(1:22:47) men or feminism or whatever I think that a lot of our lives have fundamentally changed in ways that people aren't even
(1:22:53) aware of in an incredibly short amount of time when I was in school and Facebook came out back then online only
(1:22:59) existed to augment your real life but at some point past 15 years in real life it
(1:23:05) became real life I don't use Facebook or Discord to connect with real life friends I use Facebook and just to get
(1:23:10) friends that's not the same thing but because it plays into these like really bad I don't really remember much of the
(1:23:16) world before social media how old are you on 25 26 26. okay I think when I was
(1:23:22) in high school is when Facebook started to Branch out to non-harvard email addresses I was born in 88 so yeah
(1:23:29) basically the early Facebook the only there were four tabs on it I remember what all four were was like messages groups or places or something else and
(1:23:36) then your wall um I don't know if they have any of these things anymore but the only thing you would use Facebook for when I was in school was checking into parties that's what everybody used it
(1:23:42) for I got it in eighth grade and it was the first time I realized I wasn't invited to something I was like what I
(1:23:49) have a question I got a product that just went past like what do they mean when they say the feminization of men oh
(1:23:55) no don't do it I'm just curious definition of this it's certainly
(1:24:01) definite it's like men today act like women in which ways oh no no I'm just curious because it's something I don't
(1:24:07) understand because it gets talked about a lot and I just stare at the wall and I'm like I'm confused by what this means
(1:24:12) which way is um it's just like I don't know men today act like women so it's like even in
(1:24:18) their language in in I don't know I like the way they talk and stuff
(1:24:24) really um okay
(1:24:29) I say evolutionary traps make us feel good we keep pursuing it even more a really good example of this I think work
(1:24:34) from home is probably a really bad idea that being locked in your room like doing your work on your computer screen you like you wake up you're working then
(1:24:41) you get off and you play The League of Legends and you talk to people on Discord and then you go to sleep and you repeat that for 365 days that has to rot
(1:24:46) the mind more than feminism more than patriarchy more than anything else technology has it's hurt men and
(1:24:52) benefited women now with the Advent of Instagram the Advent online you don't agree with that
(1:24:58) just everything in the world helps women and everything in the world hurt man it sounds like men are [ __ ] children that's what it sounds like is what no I
(1:25:05) think that technology has probably helped everybody and hurt everybody in a lot of different ways that we're still like for instance he brings up it's I
(1:25:10) don't even think I brought this on the show but he brings up Instagram I'm pretty sure social media is like some of the most damaging stuff for young girls
() 
(1:25:16) in middle school and high school because of how much like information they're bombarded with in terms of beauty
(1:25:21) standards and how they look it's like been an extremely detrimental thing that I think is pretty well stated at this point
(1:25:27) but you guys are like well but Instagram helps them get flown out to Dubai so I think like yeah it does yeah it's like
(1:25:34) totally you're totally disconnected from like the real world I mean I mean it also lets you catfish the hell
(1:25:39) out of men like with these freaking Instagram filters oh my God the only girls come on the show and then they're
(1:25:45) gonna make fun of me Pearl just talks about the girls of the show I don't know what to tell you where it's like I'll look at their Instagram they look completely different it's like how are
(1:25:52) you gonna complain about beauty standards if like you're changing your face online yeah but even that that like who's getting catfished more there men
(1:25:59) or other women men are they because that's the issue right it's because like young girls are
(1:26:05) looking at that stuff on Instagram and they think that's what a woman looks like oh they know because my little sister I don't edit pictures on
(1:26:11) Instagram I don't know how in all honesty but like my my sister when she's like going through Instagram and stuff
(1:26:17) she'll be the first to say like nobody she doesn't look like that because they all do it so they all know yeah but they're all trying to fit that beauty
(1:26:23) standard if that's all you're saying if you're bombarded with those image I don't know what to tell you this is just like objectively true like people
(1:26:28) evaluate their beauty starts based on the media that they consume and the thing that emerges around them like that's just absolutely true freaking who
(1:26:34) I mean even without Photoshop filters people pick their best photos Ryan the best lighting then why don't you say
(1:26:39) guys getting catfished
(1:26:45) and they should know when women are using filters boohoo I mean they they probably should I mean
(1:26:51) I think men do know that's the crazy thing they do know okay then we're not getting catfish we're all just making [ __ ] up for each other I mean I
(1:26:57) think you you know when you get come on get on the Tinder date it's like who is this well I know now I've learned
(1:27:03) my lesson yeah cheating apps women get more opportunities now than ever before so what happens is is that a majority of
(1:27:08) men now aren't even considered as suitable candidates what's happened is you know don't think that's true like
(1:27:13) okay is women have stepped into more and more traditionally masculine roles they're earning more money they're
(1:27:20) handling they're stable there's more to them than just looking pretty but men are not allowed to step in traditionally
(1:27:25) feminine roles now they've taken the masculine role of like hold on I got a career I'm working I'm smart I got to handle my okay cool well can I just like
(1:27:31) be somebody like take care of the household like let me like cook and clean no you're a [ __ ] loser wait hold on but that's what you did 40 years
(1:27:37) ago but now that women have stepped into the mask and roll they're looking at all these men and you know studies show this women are earning more and more and more
(1:27:42) and more but they still won't date down so economically they still won't date a poor guy I was like well hold on if you are a man and you find a woman
(1:27:48) oftentimes this is going to be the first person you can actually connect with on an emotional level in your entire [ __ ] life because you don't connect
(1:27:54) like that with your Bros you don't connect like that with guys who have conversations she doesn't need a man for that emotional connection she can get a lot of emotional connections from her
(1:28:00) friend group I want to say like 38 or 37 of women are okay being single one of the reasons why that happens and this is
(1:28:06) where I will attack a lot of like the hyper masculine stuff that red pill cell is men are horrible friends to each
(1:28:12) other other when you listen to two women talk she might go through some and she's like man I got this going on this is how I feel about this and they're talking to
(1:28:18) each other about their feelings up they have like these they have they have these really rich and fulfilling friendships with each other women yes
(1:28:23) they I'm curious do the guys do the guys in the room do you think that's true like men are bad friends to each other
(1:28:30) no he doesn't it's true absolutely I'm just curious do you guys like you
(1:28:37) don't so you talk about your problems to your guy friends no I think men generally don't share those types of
(1:28:42) problems so you don't no you don't do it not nowhere near to the extent that women do okay but you think we it should
(1:28:48) be an equal extent I think that women do it so like if women if I have five problems a day I share with my friends
(1:28:54) how many should men do if if you're gonna make it like a hyper autistic like do I share every single like when my shoes don't fit blah blah blah no but I
(1:29:00) think that women that's rude I don't know what's sharing five problems I don't understand five problems a day
(1:29:06) means you're not engaging in my question like if you would be I just want to know when it you would be happy with the amount of problems men would share if
(1:29:12) you have a significant problem in your life that it would enrich yourself to get feedback from from your friends then
(1:29:17) it's good to communicate that problem do you mean men on average struggle yes but see this is like what I'm what I talked
(1:29:22) about earlier the feminization of men he's doing it because he's trying to tell men to communicate like women
(1:29:28) because I think women oh there I just showed it I just showed it boom can I get an edit but I feel like you can
(1:29:34) communicate without necessarily being like women do you mean like overly emotional and crying no no one is Pearl
(1:29:42) do you think that less men should commit suicide yes why are you trying to feminize men you're trying to make men like women
(1:29:48) where men don't commit suicide [Music]
(1:29:56) oh my God this is his debate test he's a debater it's like it's like we'll be talking about A and B and he'll bring up
(1:30:01) point six bro not a good look for you so far he's brought up not a good look for you that Pearl sorry oh my God he's
(1:30:07) brought up suicide he's brought up child molestation and abuse it's like yeah why
(1:30:12) did they laugh like this is what the lefties they'll do they'll bring up these random points that have nothing to
(1:30:17) do with what we're talking about nothing to do I think maybe it's better to put it like um
(1:30:23) like men can open up without being overly emotional right I think that's usually I don't think anybody should be
(1:30:29) overly emotional men or women no yeah of course but I think maybe men are a bit too much closed off because uh I mean
(1:30:36) isn't a talking point of red pill sort of like no one listens to men no one cares about men but usually isn't that
(1:30:41) because men don't care about men true so I think that's what he was trying to get at before he went absolutely true
(1:30:48) absolutely can you explain that again don't worry about that yeah well at
(1:30:54) least the talking points I've seen as like people don't care about men's feelings that's why they commit so when I when I say people are talking about
(1:31:00) society as a whole doesn't care about men's issues who's Society aren't there like two types of people okay so let's
(1:31:06) do you feel like women on men um yeah um yeah I mean I would say men
(1:31:14) have more empathy to men's problems than women do um however I would say it's on both sides yes
(1:31:23) I don't know which question you answered I'm just saying that like it feels like if it's it would seem strange that we
(1:31:29) have a societal epidemic of people not listening to men if all men were listening to men feels like that's probably something yeah I said I think
(1:31:36) that yeah no I think that men also don't listen to men's problems at times too like you okay
(1:31:42) mother
(1:31:47) might be ready to kill himself and he's like John what's up he's like not that much man how are you doing yeah you know and then like like it's like what the
(1:31:53) [ __ ] is happening guys suck at talking to each other we do the emotional connection that we have with each other
(1:31:58) absolutely abysmal but guys are so dumb they'll sit there in the friend zone for decades and give away free attention and
(1:32:05) get used and not even understand their value it is so socially acceptable to talk about power dynamics and
(1:32:10) relationships when they benefit the man nobody talks about them when they benefit the women that really bothers me
(1:32:16) like everybody will talk about see he's on our side now Zone you know that girl wants to date you and here you are just
(1:32:21) having sex with you that's manipulative you're a piece of [ __ ] and then it's like oh okay well you've got this guy
(1:32:26) that you've got given you like wake-up calls on Saturday Sunday morning that you wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole okay and this guy like walks your dog
(1:32:32) like how are you not abusing the [ __ ] out of this dude if anything at the very least Zone girls are just getting
(1:32:37) physically this guy's soul is getting by you okay you are rotting this man from
(1:32:43) the inside out let him this is the first time you've seen you speak facts go okay free this poor man from his like
(1:32:49) servitude because holy how important is freedom to you and why I don't think freedom is very important to many people at all I think people like the idea of
(1:32:55) freedom there's an interesting book there's one that's called the Paradox of choice the reality is when you actually put more choices in front of people they
(1:33:00) actually get more stressed out about picking the wrong thing yes facts they did that ice cream flavor you can even feel that if you go to a restaurant and
(1:33:06) they give you a menu with like 50 things that's some stressful like people want to be able to pursue the things that make them happy that doesn't always mean
(1:33:12) you need to be able to choose between 500 things sometimes it does but not usually I think people just want to be able to carve out paths in their life
(1:33:18) you need the freedom to be able to choose like the job that you want or like to be able to have a family or to raise kids or or that type of thing so I
(1:33:23) don't think that having a ton of freedom is necessarily the most important thing but you at least have to feel like you have the freedom to make the choices you want femininity and masculinity should
(1:33:30) be balanced in every person right like even your hormones like men produce some estrogen women produce some testosterone like like it's part of you that you
(1:33:36) should be able to as a strong man have some feminine traits or as a strong woman have some masculine trades like I
(1:33:41) think it's good to be balanced I think when you shut off those things completely because you think that like being a man means you have to be the most extreme unemotional person ever
(1:33:47) that's you get people coming back from like Vietnam or Iraq that are like PTSD to the [ __ ] brand because they feel like they can't open up or talk to
(1:33:52) anybody about anything I think that it is a weakness as a man to be unable to like address or handle or deal with your
(1:33:58) feelings in an open and honest manner to not be able to do that and I feel like you've got to lock everything down and not process those things I think that's
(1:34:03) a person that has a weakness that they need to address I agree I think the only thing is is that you need to open it with other men that understand your uh
(1:34:10) struggle and your experience that's another reason too do you clip him saying I agree um for like yourself I don't know what
(1:34:16) channel is this not a fan of opening up to women this yeah I'm curious it says fresh and fit no I don't this seems this
(1:34:23) is this like accomplishing of me right you definitely have sympathy I was like sure yeah I don't know because they
(1:34:29) don't understand the middle experience and not only do they not understand the mail Express they don't give a [ __ ] about them experience they've come on this podcast if we've had discussions
(1:34:34) about this most women don't even know that like one-third of guys is either a virgin or hasn't had sex in the past year but I will say on the flip side too
(1:34:40) guys are holy brain dead when it comes to understanding some of the fears or struggles that women have sometimes too right yeah guys are like oh like I'm
(1:34:47) eating first day why can't I just pick you up from your house like why can't you just come back to my place or whatever it's like bro you weigh 80 pounds heavier this home you could
(1:34:52) [ __ ] and it's instant if you wanted to what who which channel is this I'm just
(1:34:57) curious what land on a good rape analogy I mean uh

(1:37:18) sick but left the family leaving my dad and Bruins your advice would make me weak sneako and the rest inspire me to
(1:37:24) be better than you that's the pool you think red pillars give bad advice because you think people are shallow and
(1:37:30) stupid and to end up following their own voices instead of Virtues um destiny Tech and social media has
(1:37:36) replaced the men because of women they think they don't need us because we built the technology to make their lives
