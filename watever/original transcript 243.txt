OF for a little while um back in Arkansas So yeah Arkansas Nice You were
11:50
in the top 1% too Yep Yep Make a lot of cannabis content and adult Wait you
11:55
combined cannabis content with burlesque With burlesque with my spirituality
12:00
Cannabis is a big part of me So even my church is centered around cannabis What What the hell is burlesque Burlesque
12:07

12:14
Like dont vintage Who the hell is that Oh no
12:21
that's unfortunate I know I know My degeneracy skills are not up to snuff
12:27
Who is She's like a famous burlesque dancer like the most I feel like this is
12:32
a circle I'm like what is this dancing And you're like this chick is well who's that the chick who did that type of dancing So it's like I will say
12:38
burlesque dancers consider it more of an art form They're not just working on
12:45
stage It's like Yeah it's a stage right Whereas I guess like at a strip club
12:50
like the burlesque dancers they don't do like private room No there's no
12:56

doing solo content Was it uh boy girl content Uh solo girl sometimes Uh mostly
13:28
revolving around cannabis honestly Yeah So in you guys would be like like making
13:35
out and there's cannabis in the background No we're usually smoking a jet Like is there like a bag of like
13:40
cannabis on your head or something No Like the like bongs and blunts and
13:46
beautiful I'm honestly I'm a little surprised to hear that cuz I didn't think that they allowed smoking on there
13:53
You have to be very uh creative with cannabis content in general but
13:58
especially when you have like o platforms like you were saying Yeah I mean that would be just one step too far
14:04

16:52
All right One year about one year Uh how did you guys meet We met on Bumble Oh
16:59
What was your opening message I don't remember We were actually I I know our first conversation was talking
17:05
about Easter and that he was with his family and I was a little confused
17:11
because on his profile part of the reason I matched with him was because it said he was Jewish So I was like Easter
17:18
but I guess his family is half so they celebrate both uh holidays Passover and
17:24
Easter And so we chatted a little bit about that You were looking specifically for
17:29
someone who's Jewish Yeah Yeah Is it because you're Jewish I'm Jewish Yeah All right And the two-year relationship
17:36
who broke up with who Um it was kind of mutual I would say Mutual Got it Okay
17:43
All right What about you Oh boy Um recently engaged like in the last week
17:49
Um have a wonderful fiance Before this I was married to a man twice So two
17:56
different marriages Both to the same guy Different guys Oh different kinds Okay Yeah Then I've been married to one other
18:03
uh woman and so I've got um I would consider myself a lesbian but you know at times I've been kind of by um I'm
18:11
also right now I'm monogamous but prior to this engagement I've lived a polyamorous lifestyle Um I preached that
18:18
openly at my church So um longest relationship would probably be to my
18:24
ex-husband We were together like 12 and a half years something like that Uh let me just get a bit of clarification So
18:30
you were married twice right Um in terms of chronological timeline you were
18:36
married to a a woman also correct So is that three marriages total Uh yes that's right And then in terms of chronological
18:42
timeline can you just tell us like was it was it the man the man the woman or like what was the order I guess Funny Uh
18:48
yeah So man man then woman woman and now again almost Yeah woman again So wait So
18:55
you've been married three times Oh but then you were in a relationship with another woman and now you're currently
19:01
engaged to a woman That's the same woman So three marriages and then this fourth one to my current fiance And you're
19:07
engaged and she's a woman She's a woman Yeah I checked Gotcha Um and then also
19:14
uh you said you were polyamorous I'm more monogamous now recently Um uh you
19:20
know it's a struggle I'll be honest You know she knows I'm honest about it Um
19:25
monogamy is a struggle for me Um even being very religious and being a pastor um I have different views than most on
19:32
relationships and monogamy but I'm doing it Couple couple further clarifying questions Um the length of your
19:39
marriages Yeah Uh the first marriage how long was your first marriage Like 3 years And was it monogous or open Uh
19:45
monogous That was Yeah Okay Uh your second marriage uh how long did that one last That one was longer Um we were both
19:51
very deep into church I was a deaconess He was a deacon We were in like a traveling gospel band That marriage and
19:59
relationship was uh 12 years It was mostly monogous until right up at the
20:04
end u when we opened my our marriage up because I came out So Oh okay And you
20:09
said towards the end and it was 12 you were married So would you say in like was it year 10 Probably year 11 Year
20:16
10 My ex-wife right there at the end Oh Okay All right man This is there's a lot
20:23
of lore here Um okay So and then uh how long to your How excuse
20:30
me how long was your third marriage That one Oh goodness Seven years Seven years
20:35
And how old were you when you first got married Um oh goodness Uh 1920 Yeah 1920
20:42
Okay And then the guy who you married how long had you been dating him prior to the marriage in 1920 Three years we
20:49
did Okay So you guys were like high school sweethearts then No he was 13 years older than me or still is Um so
20:56
wait And you met when you were old Um that one I was 26 around 26 or so Yeah I
21:02
thought you Wait but I thought you met him when you were uh 19 That was my first There's a lot to take in here I
21:09
know I'm trying to keep up That's right Uh so okay wait So you The first one
21:15
your first marriage was at 19 19 Two or three years old But you had been dating him like maybe like how soon after
21:23
meeting him did you get married Okay So I grew up as a Jehovah's Witness I
21:28
didn't really date or do any kind of interacting until I was 19 Met him
21:33
online This was back when like Yahoo Messenger and AOL Messenger was still a thing Okay I think we chatted on that
21:40
platform for about a month or two before he met me in person And then we had like
21:46
a three-year relationship Okay got it Okay Of not celebrating
21:52
Christmas Um yeah I was like "Oh yeah he celebrates Christmas and birthday so I'll give this a shot." I had never done
21:58
that before until I was in my 20s Never celebrated my birthday or anything Yeah And so you've pretty much been it sounds
22:05
like there weren't really long periods of being single No you were married
22:10
married married married pretty much Uh I mean what was the longest break from I guess the age of 18 to now at 37 uh like
22:18
of actually being single I guess or not married I suppose Um a couple months I
22:23
mean so little that I really couldn't even date when I was single Like I couldn't tell you at what chronological
22:29
point I was actually single I've always been Okay active Got it And
22:35
uh I'm trying to parse all this information that's coming at me It's a lot I should have went last Sorry No
22:42
it's good It's good And uh you said you were Jehovah's Witness Uh are you still
22:48
like what's your denomin You're Christian right Um Christian uh slash a little Shinto a little Buddhism My
22:54
church kind of incorporates spirituality from a lot of different religions Um especially like nature-based a little
23:01
bit of Christianity but you know it's mostly love thy neighbor love the earth and love yourself The church of
23:07
spiritualism Yeah pretty much It's called the waters So very very nature We'll come come back to that I'm sure
23:13
Andrea has a couple questions on that one but we'll get everybody's uh relationship status So okay Uh and your
23:19
longest relationship you said was 13 years 13 12 years Okay Currently and how
23:24
long have you been seeing your current partner So we met on New Year's Day this year Got engaged uh on Valentine's Day
23:32
this year Um that's when I asked her to marry me and then she turned around and asked me to marry her like a week ago So
23:39
double check So you guys been together for about five six months right Five six months Yeah All right That engaged Very
23:45
And you you proposed in six weeks She was also So like with
23:50
you with the Jewish thing I really thought that was interesting cuz like for me and her she had also shared
23:55
Jehovah's Witness past for almost the same amount of time as me And that was like very connecting for us uh for her
24:02
to understand that part of my history and vice versa So we connected really
24:07
fast Okay All right Uh and you said uh
24:13
you were a deacon This was that when is that under Jehovah's Witness No that's
24:19
Baptist So that 12 year marriage So what's the transition from you started as Jehovah's Witness Correct And then
24:25
you became Baptist and now and then was there were you uh Presbyterian or what
24:32
was the transition to where you're at now currently I would honestly say atheism I went from very strict uh
24:40
religious you know lifestyle for the majority of my life Um I you can't really leave being a Jehovah's Witness
24:46
once you commit Um so Oh like the shunning Yeah So I got shunned or dysfellowshipped as they called it Can't
24:53
talk to my family or friends or anything Mom you know all that So went from that Like you you're not in touch with your
24:59
Not really No My mom passed so Oh sorry to hear that Yeah Yeah Uh what about like other family that's still Jehovah's
25:05
Witness Have you last time you spoke to them Years Um I was raised by a white family for 10 years also Were you
25:12
adopted or what She basically I mean she was also a Jehovah's Witness My mom was going through a really hard mental time
25:19
and so she came in you know changed my life They really did Um but she's also a witness so can't really talk to her So I
25:27
left that or got kicked out of that Went into the Baptist religion when I met my ex-husband He was already really deep in
25:34
the church So that just really took off Do you ever miss dating guys or are you
25:41
kind of over it Um yes and no I mean it we've only been together me and my fiance 6 months So before that I had
25:48
dated a guy or two You have to be really special to slip through that gate for me so to speak Um got it So I don't really
25:54
miss it but you know Yeah And then final question here You said you've uh you're
26:00
you've had periods of polyamory Yeah Uh so I guess uh what when was that Very
26:07
recently I mean it's it's a more recent thing Okay And then you were uh what's the most amount of people you've dated
26:14
at one time What do you consider dating Just like hooking up with hooking up
26:20
with hooking up with all the way to like a relationship Did you have poly partners where you're like you have
26:26
multiple Yeah there were definitely some polyules There was multiple polyules
26:31
Okay Yeah What Tell us about the polycules Oh goodness Well I mean for me I would probably say four at the was
26:39
like the max of me dating at the same time those four people But then especially back in the South and being
26:46
in the LGBTQIA community there's not a lot of us So like those same four
26:51
probably dated the same four who dated Yeah So Okay And what what was the break
26:57
uh the gender breakdown for the Polycule Was it honestly it was mostly girls and those girls boyfriends I'm not sure why
27:04
those girls boyfriends seem to have a thing But you were just dealing with the the it was a group of four girls or was
27:10
there one guy Girls Okay Four different girls And I see Okay Got it Wait And
27:16
they had boyfriends Most of them did But would you be like dealing with the boyfriends too Yep So you were the
27:24

28:43
Sure I'm sure he broke up with me on that one I can't remember Got it Okay What about you Uh longest relationship I
28:50
was married for 13 years Um I'm currently single and the last time I dated someone was probably 6 months ago
28:58
6 months ago All right The marriage uh who broke up with who I ended that
29:05
You ended it So you filed for divorce Yes I did Only marriage Only marriage Only marriage Okay Uh why Um I don't
29:13
want to go into too much detail but there was um these terms What's only marriage Wait what Only marriage Wait
29:19
what did I say Only marriage Oh I meant if if it was her only marriage Oh her only marriage I was like does that mean
29:25
two only fans people were married Like what does that mean He's learning a lot today Only marriage If it was uh if she
29:31
had been married um no it was my only marriage Uh there was DV involved So
29:37
yeah Got it Okay And uh did that and if you don't want to talk about totally
29:42
fine was that something that was always present in the relationship or it manifested later on I think those are
29:47
things that kind of happen It's like a cycle on and off So it was always present Not a lot in the beginning
29:52
eventually Yeah Got worse Got it Okay And you said you've been single for 6 months Was that when the marriage ended
29:59
or is that a different relationship I've been divorced about 5 years now 5 years Got it Um the last person that I
30:04
considered seriously dating was when we ended it was about 6 months ago And how long were you uh seeing him I want to
30:11
say maybe eight or nine months All right It was a long-distance relationship so it was different for me Very different Who broke up with who I want to say it
30:18
was mutual but honestly I'd say he did Yeah All right Got it What about you Um

my longest relationship was a year I'm currently single I've been single for like 2 3 months maybe Um and then I had
30:34
a relationship not too long ago So Oh sorry Got it Uh the one year
30:40
relationship who broke up with who Um I broke up with her because we were having
30:46
issues from previous circumstances and things that happened Okay Uh and actually I think it

31:22
specifically for a relationship but Got it What about you Same Straight experimentation but straight Okay Uh by
31:32
No I'm kidding 99.9% of the time Yeah All right What about you Bye Okay Bye Um

39:14
is Like the video if you're enjoying the stream so far Thank you guys Okay Uh let's see where do we begin
39:23
Andrew I think would be interested in uh exploring the whole pastor thing with
39:28
you Um although it sounds like you're not strictly Christian No we're with
39:34
your religion So just a spiritualist right Very spiritual Yes Yes Okay We incorporate many different religions
39:40
into our practice Okay So when are you a universalist No I wouldn't really say that because
39:46
there are some things that really don't align with um I would say my teachings
39:52
or viewpoints but we don't turn down any viewpoints As long as their religion or spirituality is based in love and
39:58
respect for the planet we live on and its people we're pretty much align Okay Whatever that is Yeah
40:06
Okay All right So let's see here Where do we begin We're going to start with uh
40:13
Shannon here with your notes Shannon you previously stated that
She ONLY wants millionaires?!
40:21
you will not date uh somebody who makes less than seven
40:26
figures Has that changed at all I said seven figures Yeah You said you only
40:32
date six to seven figure or well six six or seven Okay fair Figure earning men
40:39
and you'd love to discuss your experiences Sorry So oh were you
40:44
laughing Oh okay I think she sneezed Oh it was a sneeze Oh okay I thought it was like a It was a laugh It might have been
40:50
a laugh All right I'm going with laugh
40:55
We can talk about it Um go ahead So yeah we talked about that in our previous
41:02
show that I was on that I did previously date men who made six or have six to
41:10
seven figures However my current relationship that I'm in he it's a
41:16
little complicated in regards to that However I have negotiated for myself that sort of
41:25
want in a partner because he brings so much else to the table
41:33
Like what Well we have a lot in common We have a lot in common Like I mentioned
41:40
we're both Jewish so we have religion in common I mean we're both not super
41:45
religious but we do have where we grew up celebrating the same holidays and having similar traditions and stuff like
41:51
that Did you go to temple any of that We used to go to more of like a reformed
41:58
sort of temple but we stopped going cuz it was outside and it's just kind of gross to it like in a park It was weird
42:07
Maybe we'll start going again if they like start doing services inside but when it's too cold out or too hot it's
42:13
weird Uh we also are both into comedy so he's uh into comedy writing and
42:19
performance as well And yeah we just have very similar
42:24
like wants for our future and stuff like that So so what's he making Um so he
42:32
does a few different things as well for income I don't know his exacts of what he's making Um but he has a lot of
42:39
different investments So do you make more than he does At the moment I think I might
42:47
actually It depends on the month and what we're doing but some months I probably do make more but he in the
42:55
grand scheme of things has more resources and things like that
43:00
Gotcha Okay So you don't know how much your person you're dating makes Well he
43:08
doesn't have like a standard job He's more like a gig economy type with his work Like he does video editing and
43:17
he'll do stuff in the arts for film and stuff like that Um but he also just started his own
43:23
business with my help cuz I run my own businesses a few of them So he's starting a photo booth company So that's
43:30
kind of new but he did have some help from his family in starting that up So
43:35
that's where it's a little complicated What's the complication Well like his specific like income it's like he's
43:42
maybe not making money yet from the actual business but he has like family income resources things like that So he
43:48
definitely will date outside of a six or seven figure bracket I mean it depends on the person I normally before meeting
43:55
him would have probably not been that open to it just because of my previous experiences with men who've brought in
44:03
that type of income and just being kind of comfortable with like upper middle
44:08
class life Uh but like I was saying he has so much that he like brings to the
44:15
table and we really get along and yeah he's opened me up to to doing that Is he
44:20
older or younger He's older He's about 10 years older Gotcha Okay
44:28
But before him my past two relationships had uh more income coming
44:34
in from like working and stuff like that Gotcha Now did you do a lot of content
44:40
creation right Yeah So did you meet this person cuz they were doing like clips for you or something like that No we met on Bumble We Yeah we went on a dating
44:47
app Oh okay That's right Gotcha All right Well I guess um I don't have the
44:54
notes here Hang on That's Yeah All right Um sorry you
45:00
happened to get up I'm like I I just couldn't keep that going
45:05
I don't know what you said that Um has anybody tried the water
45:11
Yes Did it taste weird Yeah I don't know I took one I don't really think I Does
45:18
it taste weird Like tap Is it tap It is tap Yeah Okay Just like T But
45:24
should I be concerned Do you want to let us know why it would taste weird
45:29
No it it's uh we just put in fresh water Oh okay But it's running through like
Brian poisoned the water?
45:36
this filter and I think the like the it's probably not harmful but like the
45:42
the filter or something is like giving it a weird taste or something I don't know You think it
45:48
smells I think it s it tastes fine but it smells weird It tastes fine Smell
45:54
that Yeah it smells a little citrusy Citrusy We all smelling different things
46:00
Okay What is going on This is what did I sign up for Like a fish
46:06
tank Did y'all fish Does the water taste The water tastes water tastes like
46:14
aquarium It smells fishy Does it taste like weird No but that's that's interesting It does smell fishy I don't
46:20
even know how that's possible How is that possible Can someone Google that Okay here's here's what I think it is
46:28
Chat can you help any scientists in the chat help us out So I
46:35
had this was like one or two months ago We bought octopus from Costco Okay Well
46:43
hold on Hold on And I kept it in the refrigerator for one day and then we
46:49
used it during the show and then we tossed it I think this is my hypothesis theory
46:56
I don't know whatever I think somehow and mind you the octopus was uh plastic
47:02
wrapped you know like it's totally wrapped Yeah I think somehow the octopus
47:08
is so powerful it seeped into seeped into the
47:14
air of my refrigerator and somehow it's it's been it's not been in there It was
47:21
in there for one day and I've cleaned the refrigerator
47:27
minuscule minuscule particles of octopus have
47:34
somehow I don't know this might not make any sense but I
47:39
think we have no it's it sounds very scientific I'm enjoying this but for what other
47:45
reason scientific would the it smell like seafood well there's a like just a
47:51
possibility that the filter is broken and whatever the chemical compound is smells somewhat close to Oh the the that
47:58
could actually explain it Is that possible That sounds a lot better than octopus particles from Well does when
48:04
you open your refrigerator do you get whips right No No I don't smell I don't smell it at all That was just my like
48:11
really stupid low IQ hypothesis of okay there was octopus in there like in a day
48:18
but it permeated somehow and there's just octopus particles and then they're
48:26
getting into I'm going with his the filter Did you rinse the octopus No Chances are pretty good that there's
48:32
just like a bad filter The compound smell fishy You think it's a bad filter Oh it did Yeah probably a bad filter
48:38
Does someone know if if that's possible to have a filter that can smell like fish Can like I'm looking at see what
48:45
the chat says Yeah help please This is about to turn into a crazy live Tap
48:50
water filter contains charcoal Yes Octopus particles
48:58
No Clean your fridge I cleaned it

50:21
Felicity You should have just not said anything Oh my god You should have just you should have just allowed No I'm sure

51:56
investigating the octopus gate Uh how much does he your current boyfriend make
Her boyfriend and skin removal
52:02
We were talking about that a little bit It's complicated because he's part of
52:07
like the gig economy and he also has like some investments like his property
52:14
and things like that Um and he just started a new business and he's getting some help from family with starting that
52:21
up So that's why I say it's a little complicated cuz he's got his hat and a few different things And you said that
52:28
he got you a promise ring I'm wearing it right now Yes
52:34
Nice Congress So what what is a promise ring And basically we've been together
52:40
for a year and it's kind of like his commitment to obviously being loyal and
52:47
to having a future together but it's not an engagement cuz we're just not really ready to be engaged Uh he knows that I
52:55
have pretty like high standards when it comes to like the person I'm with and
53:01
making a certain amount of income So he wants to work for the next year to get me a better engagement ring
53:09
Okay I think I haven't heard about promise ring since high school Um yeah it's oldfashioned for sure Okay All
53:17
right And then uh you wanted to these are your new notes You'll be talking to
53:23
your doctor about skin removal surgery Yeah Did you write is that that's the most recent ones you sent us Okay
53:30
Okay So last last time I was on the show I was down about 80 lbs and I've maintained
53:38
that weight loss So I've basically been losing weight for like two years The first year I lost the 80 lbs and then
53:46
this past year I've maintained that loss And so now I'm trying to basically do it
53:52
again And by the time that I do another like 75 to 80 lbs I'm planning to get
53:58
skin removal surgery So I'm talking to my doctor about that right now And that's kind of like what I document of
54:05
my own content of kind of like my glow up weight loss journey Mhm Yeah Okay And
54:12
uh the journey Yeah We talked about that last time It's a journey Mhm And uh okay we're going to move over to

54:34
notes for you Yeah exactly Oh wait I have something that I want to talk about with the skin removal Oh if we go back
54:40
to that real quick Is it dating related Yeah it is Okay Um so the reason that I'm thinking about it now is because I'm
54:48
trying to talk to my doctor about getting it through my insurance However my boyfriend has given me the money to
54:55
get a tummy tuck Okay Yeah there you go Yeah And he said I can talk about it
55:01
like we've we've discussed what I you know can share Usually when you do a tummy tuck though you do the all the
55:08
weight loss first and then do the tummy tuck right Yeah So we're trying to plan out when that tummy tucks is going to
55:13
happen but I already have the money to either do that or if insurance can cover
55:18
that then I want to get like my arms and potentially my thighs done So I have the
55:24
money to do it So I feel pretty motivated Amazing Okay Uh here I'll do Chef Tail Pickles really quick Uh the
55:32
agent chef that taught me how to cook would always put the octopuses in the dish Oh my god His standard culinary
55:39

Hookup Stories and VALUES
56:03
Gabriella Gabriella there It's Gabrielle Oh my bad Okay Gabriella Let me fix that
56:08
You just call me Gabby Okay Um Oh are those reading glasses or
56:14
uh Yeah Well they're like prescription I have to add them on I can't see Okay that's fine Um you said in your notes
56:22
here one time you hooked up or a guy you hooked up with We didn't hook up We didn't hook up Well I'll read it as you
56:29
wrote it but one time a guy you hooked up with dated hooked up with and dated
56:34
lied to you about his age because he knew you wouldn't get with him if he
56:41
told you his actual age Okay I thought it was something else But yeah he lied
56:46
about me Lied about his age to me He was uh two years younger than me Oh How old
56:52
were you I was I was 17 turning 18 but I was very strict on how like much younger
56:58
I dated because I have a little sister He's in the same age range as her and that's just weird So 17 going 18 So he
57:05
was 15 He was he just turned 16 Okay And you were 17 Yeah Okay So all right
57:12
bothered me No that's I mean he I don't think there's Is is there an issue there with the a 17 with a 16 I mean not not
57:19
necessarily but it's just more The issue was he lied Yeah And then it was just uncomfortable with me cuz just weird
57:26
Okay Uh you said that traditional You think traditional values that are pushed
57:32
onto men and and women in relationships Wait hold on Was there more to that
57:43
I don't remember It's been a minute Okay here I'll pull it up directly
57:50
Uh wait Oh you had a guy try to tie you up
57:55
with a bandana Oh my gosh Oh wait That Wait
58:02
Okay How did somebody get tied up with a bandana A miscommunication He took things the wrong way Oh we were watching
58:08
a show Yeah someone does I made a I made a joke about something that was happening on TV and then he was like "Oh
58:14
you want me to tie you up with a banana?" and then started to get up and grab it And I was just like "Are you talking about No No It was just weird
58:23
Odd." Did he tie you up with the bandana No No Oh no Was it cuz it was a bandana
58:30
and not rope that or maybe maybe Okay Uh
58:35
and the Okay So going back to this though So it was any dating topics or takes you want to speak on if so what to
58:43
which you wrote I think traditional values that are pushed onto men and women in relationships or otherwise So
58:51
are you against traditional values that are pushed onto men and women or are you in in favor of them Not necessarily I
58:58
mean it's I think it's really up to what the people like the people in the relationship wants but when you're
59:04
trying to push that agenda onto people who aren't practicing that that's when it gets negative
59:10
I see Okay Uh what negative how I guess I mean it's
59:16
like it's just judging people for living their life the way you don't want to
59:22
live it I guess like it gets like let's say a girl's out sleeping with multiple
59:27
people not in a relationship and then someone who like is in a long term they
59:32
just start hating on that person I think you just mind your own business cuz it's
59:37
not your life I guess things like that Do you think it should be that way just with strangers What about people that
59:44
are like in your family I mean in your family you can advocate it but it gets like if you can advocate for having a
59:50
better dating life but it if you're pushing it in a way that's shaming them
59:57
for how they're doing things then it's inherently negative I guess
1:00:04
Okay Um so if somebody I'm trying to think of
1:00:10
an example here Uh if a guy didn't want to date a woman because of her body count and he
1:00:16
was he prescriptively was like "Yeah that's a bad thing People shouldn't be promiscuous." Would you object to
1:00:23
No cuz that's his preference That's what he thinks Yeah that he's trying to instill his like he's trying to uh put
1:00:30
out to the world like don't do that Well I mean you can advocate for it Okay Mhm But if you're
1:00:39
calling someone a [ __ ] because of it then that's where it gets foggy Gets
1:00:46
foggy Okay And then uh I noticed in some of your Instagram photos you wear a cross Are you Christian
1:00:54
Um not necessarily No Um I'm trying to get back into it I was a Baptist for uh
1:01:01
most my life and uh I just fell out of the belief when I was in middle school
1:01:07
and recently I've been wanting to get back into it Got it Okay And then you
Annoyances with BODY COUNT ?
1:01:12
also wrote uh Oh as far as disagreements with the show you said you had a lot but
1:01:19
you can't pinpoint all of it I can't pinpoint it because I just have a really bad memory
1:01:24
Like I can't remember Uh okay So uh you said probably his opinions on body count
1:01:32
What are my opinions on body count Well I can't remember but I think it's just
1:01:38
like the fact that it matters I guess I mean it does but it doesn't What's your
1:01:44
body count Two Okay Um so I guess why
1:01:50
does it not matter If you're not if you're looking for someone with low body count then look in that dating pool Let
1:01:58
me let me ask something different too If you count like BJ's
1:02:06
fingerings all that stuff does your body count change
1:02:12
Goes up by like one Okay So it does change I wouldn't add it I would include that in the body count Well I'm just
1:02:18
curious I'm just curious like is the criteria for body count just penetrative sex No cuz I think that rules out a lot
1:02:25
of Yeah because then Yeah Then then Yeah Then like homosexual women that wouldn't be a body count then right This is a
1:02:31
good point Well I think you would you would have a separate category But for the heterosexual body count I think
1:02:37
strictly would refer to intercourse So if a chick was like "Brian I'm a virgin but I sucked 100 dicks." That would be
1:02:44
like you know she'd be really good at it So that that could be judged but I wouldn't
1:02:50
consider it a body count That's still it's still not
1:02:57
good It's still not great I think if you suck a dick you got to add that to the body count Well you just reminded me
1:03:03
with the hundred BJs Um I do want to just reminded you of something didn't I
1:03:09
Yeah I want to talk about Bonnie Blue at one point today Okay Sure I mean I'm
1:03:16
pretty sure like half the things she she does and says are just lies just for
1:03:21
I've seen her Twitter clickbait Yeah I mean she faked a pregnancy Like both those Bonnie Blue who's the other Den
1:03:28
Lily Oh Lily Yeah just uh I think they do some DGEN stuff but I think a lot of
1:03:33
it is just like oh I'm going to do the most like claim I did the most salacious thing or you know I I I don't think they
1:03:41
actually do a lot of degenerate stuff They claim they do I've seen some
1:03:47
Yeah I don't I haven't purchased anything but I've seen it on Twitter but I think they sensationalize some of this
1:03:53
stuff and they just make it up because they're like "Oh I don't have to actually do the thing I can just say I did the thing and still receive the
1:03:59
benefit Do you think that that chick Vonyie is really in her 20s No I think
1:04:05
she is but some people just I don't think she is I think you think she's in her 30s I mean she she could be lying
1:04:12
about her age but I don't think she's in her 30s Uh early 30s but I think she's in her
1:04:18
30s I think she's had some work done which makes her in the face I don't know
1:04:25
I don't know Uh reminded me Oh the 100 Uh but so wait where were we We're Oh
1:04:31
the the BJ does that count towards body count I mean like I for example Andrew I
1:04:37
wouldn't say a woman whose body count is zero but she's given 100 BJs is nearly
1:04:44
as desirable or the same as a woman who's had who has a body count of zero and is also given uh zero BJs So okay So
1:04:51
hang on But I wouldn't I wouldn't categorize as like a uh as a body But
1:04:57
what if she's only had one body right Given zero BJs or anything and the
1:05:02
other one has zero bodies but it's given 100 BJs Which one would you select for The one with one body Yeah The Right So
1:05:10
then so then So so yeah you see what I'm saying So it seems like you do categorize it as at least on par or
1:05:17
something close to on par with it You would Yeah But I mean I could I would say like okay a woman who's had three
1:05:23
bodies but she it was like uh it was group sex is could be arguably worse
1:05:30
than a woman who has three individual partners or even like four or five like individual bodies but they were like
1:05:36
long-term because but because of the nature of the act right Right Yeah Yeah I understand that But I just think that
1:05:42
like if a if you like finishes in a chick's mouth like I'm just going to count that as the same thing dude I just
1:05:49
count as the same thing Yeah that's fair I I mean perhaps you could ask it would be fair to ask a clarifying like okay
1:05:55
well if your your your sex body count is this what's your job count I guess but I wouldn't call it
1:06:03
a [ __ ] maybe we could throw it in there but I've when I think
1:06:08
of body count what's the count what's the blow count the blow count you know what may you know maybe there's been a
1:06:14
lot of a lot of uh you know the girl claims it's a lot of the virgins virgins
1:06:21
who have high count but the but the oral sex count very high [ __ ] I need to like
1:06:27
it's a like it's a DUI thing right It's like you know did you blow six Did you blow seven Right for the DUI It's true
1:06:34
That's a good Well you know what though Here's the other thing that I've uh Oh I have I had something on this is so and
1:06:41
maybe the panel the women on the panel could weigh in on this too is so there's
1:06:46
the body count right You could have a girl who has a body count of one and a body count of one But if you look at the
1:06:54
specific guy that each of those women was with that could have an impact Like
1:07:00
even if it's she has one she she has one if they dealt with a just like a filthy
1:07:07
dude like just a scumbag Like I'd almost like a grimy like a [ __ ] grimy dude
1:07:13
That's just an amplifier Like if it was I don't know like who's a [ __ ] grimy dude like Lil Xan or
1:07:20
Tekashi69 or like NLE Choa or the Island Boys Oh my Wait Mary Google Island Boys
1:07:28
Yeah Google images just so just so the girls here know what I'm talking about If a girl's been with a grimy dude
1:07:34
that's like an amplifier That's like 3x You got to 3x the body The I don't Yeah
1:07:41
I don't think it's just like who she slept with with that one too I think you're also questioning why she's with
1:07:46
that person and if she's overcome her trauma and like if she's addicted to
1:07:51
chaos These what These guys Can you like uh like open a new tab
1:07:59
Yeah Thank god I'm gay If a girl has had sex if she's only had sex with one of
1:08:05
the island boys that's like 30 bodies She might as well have a body count 30
1:08:11
Yeah It's a 30x 30x amplifier So that's another component of the body count
1:08:17
discussion where if she [ __ ] a grimy dude You got to count all of his Okay So one
1:08:24
more question Do we have the photo or one more question about this What about what about times So if it's like a
1:08:30
girl's slept with two guys but only once each but slept with one guy a hundred times
1:08:37
H Uh huh That's an
1:08:43
interesting Well it could almost go both ways couldn't it Because on one hand a
1:08:48
one night stand is kind of grimy Yeah it's pretty grimy Uh but then whereas
1:08:54
the other one you would say well it was like a long-term committed monogous relationship But then
1:09:01
yeah [ __ ] Was it I don't know That's a Yeah depends on I I would frame you know
1:09:07
what here's how I' here's how I would frame this right And there's probably variations based on like if you start
1:09:12
going more if there's like more Uh so it'd be something like
1:09:18
this If a girl has one body and she slept with a guy one time
1:09:24
versus she had a boyfriend and she slept slept with him a thousand times Honestly
1:09:29
I would prefer the girl who just slept with the guy one time Okay I know Yeah
1:09:36
And then I'm number two Yeah Okay But what if it's three Three One time Yeah
1:09:42
Three one time and then a chick with one guy with one guy like a thousand times
1:09:48
Really Even if it was a long-term relationship being monogamous and safe you're just like "No thanks I want the
1:09:55
one night." No I'm not Hold on I'm not saying I wouldn't date I'm not saying I wouldn't date her I'm just saying what
1:10:00
would be more preferable Yeah So the the I'm not excluding the one in the
1:10:06
long-term relationship in the the one v one example he gave but so you're saying three one night stands versus one I'd
1:10:13
pick the one in that situation Me too I'd pick the one in that situation I'd pick me too But if it's like equal for equal So but then if it starts getting
1:10:21
what Okay How about this Andrew to you Uh 10 one night stands or 10 long-term
1:10:27
relationships where they had sex 100 times each So how do you know they had sex
1:10:32
Can you have 10 long-term relationships Say she's like 35 and she's had uh Sure
1:10:38
N at that point I would take the 10 one night stands by 10 night stands Interesting because the long I mean if
1:10:44
you're in a long-term relationship that's failed nine times That's a problem right That's a bigger red flag than
1:10:50
than just have Oh that's interesting That I didn't think of it that way But yeah that would be
1:10:55
Yeah But then I mean the other one's not great either No it's not great either Neither Yeah Well this is you got to
1:11:01
push the button right Right Yeah This is the This is the body count trolley problem This is the
1:11:08
the body trolley problem Is it like Yeah it's a little weird It's like low quality or whatever Go ahead You can
1:11:13
pull it up super quick If you had to chew and you had to pick Oh god Um don't
1:11:20
they Yeah If if a girl was a virgin but [ __ ] one of these guys I'm sorry That's that's 30x amplifier I think it's
1:11:26
also cuz they're from Florida It couldn't Florida man at all already Like I mean chat chat do you
1:11:33
agree like if they if a girl has sex with a grimy dude it's a it's like a amplifier It's like an X It's a
1:11:40
multiplier I feel like this should apply to guys too Oh yeah Yeah If you if you're if you are sticking your
1:11:47
something in something nasty and you like that's that counts What would be the I I wonder what who's like a grimy
1:11:52
chick Oh we got plenty Who's a grimy Name one There's a lot right I don't
1:11:58
know Oh I don't know The ones that I think are bad though probably aren't Come on Who Who Oh I mean we could have we could use her example like if you
1:12:06
knew a guy had Well it's different though cuz girls like
1:12:12
Okay If Do you guys know who Lily Phillips is Yes Bonnie Blue Yes Okay They they I keep up She does I know
1:12:20
Sorry I don't like anybody seen That's pretty grimy That's over the top though Like she's worse than the Island Boys
1:12:26
would be the other way Brooke Candy is like an island boy but as a woman Well there you go I'm not sure who I get that
1:12:31
picture in my head I'm not sure who that is Uh all right Uh let's see here
1:12:38
But so uh going back to you what what were the disagreements I guess I guess I
1:12:44
can't pinpoint them You say but pinpoint Go ahead Pinpoint What do you mean pinpoint Go ahead Body count So okay of
1:12:50
what you just heard and we were talking about grimy uh women sleeping with grimy dudes You
1:12:57
no push back there No Island Boys are disgusting They're disgusting They I'm
1:13:03
pretty sure they did Only Fans together too or had something on Twitter they did that That was disgusting Yeah I've seen
1:13:08
I saw like a video No that was absolutely disgusting But like if a girl tells me that she like slept with a
1:13:15
famous rapper I'm just like h multip that's a 30x multiplier on the
1:13:22
body But what if it's famous What if it's famous rockstar Oh also bad Yeah but which one's worse to you though Jean
1:13:29
Simmons Uh rock stars actually have talent So I'm
1:13:35
going to I'm going to have to say uh you know Uhhuh It's although so so you're going
1:13:43
for Metallica so you're going for like so you're going for like Metallica fan girl over Diddy fan girl Uh it would be
1:13:50
like who's like a I don't know who who's Do you listen to rap music Yeah All
1:13:56
right Who's like a big rap artist right now
1:14:03
Is he's married or like Drake or something Oh yeah If a girl [ __ ]
1:14:10
Drake Yikes Um yeah cuz then she has at least good taste in music Like if she
1:14:17
[ __ ] like if she [ __ ] like Axel Rose from Guns and Roses or some [ __ ] Like Yeah I'mma give her Although man that
1:14:24
guy's he's been around since the 80s so that's a rough one I have a question Is it different for you if she actually
1:14:31
like was in a relationship and dated a like famous musician and then they broke up Like it wasn't just a one-time thing
1:14:40
Well the body is still grimy Mhm Okay Cuz they still slept with the dude Um I
1:14:46
don't know if it really changes that much Oh but here Okay But hang on If we get Oh boy All right If we get back if
1:14:52
we get back to the B question here right If they blew one of the island boys
1:14:59
wouldn't you consider that the same thing in that case Yeah
1:15:04
Nah it's still bad Don't get me wrong it's still bad but it's like it's it's
1:15:09
the uh what's it's like the progression of worseness
1:15:16
So like if if they just like held hands then kissed then uh like second base
1:15:23
oral sex uh full you know sex It's it's the progression of disgust Oh the
1:15:31
disgust progression in the room I think that shit's just as gross dude
1:15:37
Oh it's it's bad Yeah I think it's just as bad I'm putting them both in the same category Okay No but but so when we were
1:15:45
talking about like is it a body I wasn't even attributing necessarily to is it as
1:15:50
bad or not There could be some dispute over whether oral sex is in terms of the
1:15:56
disgust response is as bad as sexual intercourse
1:16:03
Uh it's disputable I guess Uh the girls are loving this conversation
1:16:12
Go for it Here's the I mean it's dating related Yeah Wait Spyro did a algorithm
1:16:18
here I can't even parse this Okay Spidey this where's the oral time
1:16:27
Oh well maybe she's linguistics All right one night stand Thank you Spyro
1:16:32
for the Oh updated math He did the updated Thank you Spiral I I can't even parse that I don't even um Wait did he
1:16:39
include it for the the grimy Is there was there a grimy back up Just use your order of operations I lost it
1:16:45
It got uh Let me see It got unstarted Yeah use your order of operations We'll figure this thing out So look ladies me
1:16:52
and Andrew here have just been talking about grimy dudes and body counts Are you guys going to push back at all on it
1:16:57
You guys seem to really love it You seem very entertained by grimy back because I think we're all kind of in agreement But
1:17:04
the thing is though how are you going to know if somebody who's maybe not famous but still equally grimy Like there are
1:17:09
men out there who sleep around crazy and don't talk about body count So like I get you're having the discussion about
Biological realities
1:17:15
it but it's like I don't know how to like Well women don't women don't have the same intuitive disgust about it that
1:17:20
men do That's the interesting part You think Same disgust Yeah Yeah Well this is in what way Yeah Yeah So um paternity
1:17:29
tests those are pretty recent inventions right Yeah How would men assure paternity before a paternity test The
1:17:36
way that they looked when the Bobby when the baby came out How else what would be the best way to assure that the child
1:17:42
was yours Make sure that you're the only one having sex The only one right So for
1:17:47
the for the assurance of reproduction for the purposes of survival right It's
1:17:53
it makes sense why men have this kind of like revolt carriage to women with multiple men They want to assure that
1:18:00
that's their offspring They can't assure it's the offspring It also is detrimental to the mother because then
1:18:06
they can just deny it right It's not mine You slept with multiple men So that's it That's why that revolter
1:18:14
disgust is there for men It's not You don't think that that's societal in there too What do you mean Um I don't
1:18:20
know if there's this is just what you find socially when you when you you know when you give different polls and
1:18:27
different questions between the sexes Correct It's not that women don't care about it I'm not saying that Right And
1:18:33
some women really care about it Just that they seem to care about it less than men care about it with them Or a
1:18:39
different reason why Like for women it'd be protection or safety because if you have someone that revulsion right We But
1:18:46
we might Yeah So if you use that terminology with someone a guy might go revolted women we might forgive more or
1:18:53
something or we might look at a a different angle That would tell me that it's just not as as prominent of a deal
1:18:59
breaker as it is for men Or if we maybe if you just did how you ask you know cuz I do think that there's women that are
1:19:05
going to be like I don't want a guy that's sleeping around too much because I don't want to catch something or I don't want to Let me like here I'll show
1:19:11
you a big distinct difference that I think will maybe change your view on this So if you tell a guy well you know
1:19:17
there's a woman and she's 28 29 years old right And she's still a virgin They
1:19:23
think well that's a pretty good catch right 28 29 But the flip side is is that
1:19:29
women will often reject men at 28 29 who are virgins because they think "What What the [ __ ] is wrong with this guy
1:19:34
That no woman wants him." So that happens often to men Um I don't know I've seen it in in coaching It just
1:19:40
depends on different societies And then also I have a lot of clients that are 30s and 40s who are virgins Mostly men
1:19:47
though right Just just I I coach women too Just just one sec We'll come right back to it Jungle Yo Jungle guys W's in
1:19:54
the chat for Jungle Pop Champagne Yo Brian what up Pop that bottle Andrew is
1:20:00
going to need it with all these lesbians Thank you brother Mr Ba bringing all the
1:20:05
race jokes to life on the other side Uh who wants party Who here wants champagne

1:20:29
by the way they better not be And if they are they should probably shut that stream off and and be done with if if
1:20:36
they were to do something that stupid you know they should probably not do
1:20:42
that Just saying Just Oh cuz it's on your channel Just saying Probably should probably
1:20:48
shouldn't be doing that But Jungle thank you so much for the uh champagne pop You're legend sir Thank you Thank you so
1:20:54
much All right we'll get this pouring Uh sorry you guys can continue on with your conversation So you were talking about
1:21:00
your clientele and how they don't care Um I think it just depends It um as far
1:21:06
as for being a virgin um I if the guy is insecure about being a virgin he'll
1:21:12
naturally go um towards and by accident date women who will say something like that right But the more he heals from
1:21:18
that insecurity the more that all of a sudden he's naturally around people that really don't care Uh but as far as
1:21:23
societal we've noticed that certain countries don't necessarily consider
1:21:29
body count or care Like Spain Spain for instance women are very much so more um
1:21:34
sexually dominant there Um they even go half on the bill or pay the bill is
1:21:40
usually that kind of so some of it societal some of it's very primal of course like you want to make sure that
1:21:46
you're procreating that your seed is that's yours So of course there's something to it on that one So I think
1:21:52
it's also how you phrase the question to someone All right let's do a really quick I don't know if it I don't know if
1:21:59
it would be how you phrase it What do you mean how you phrase the question If you ask a woman hey would you care if
1:22:04
you were um dating a guy and he was sleeping around with a whole bunch of women you know when uh while you guys
1:22:09
were in a relationship I'm sure she's going to have like a repulse factor in that right Yeah of course Um but that's
1:22:15
not really what you would ask right So what the qu what the question determines like if you're asking previous partners
1:22:22
right So if you I think if you were to keep all things equal right and you were to say to um any number of different
1:22:30
women there's a man here who has a 100 body count right Versus there's a woman here to the same equal amount of men who
1:22:38
has a 100 body count that the men would be far more revolted by that than the women Sure And I'm just saying with that
1:22:43
one sometimes we notice that that's has a little bit to do with society like in Spain compared to here for instance But
1:22:49
yes you have you have that for sure I'm picking up on on a lot of words like you
1:22:54
said uh primal I think you said something about like when you're selecting a mate to to procreate and
1:23:00
everything Like for me body count and like putting value on anybody male
1:23:07
female whatever um based on who they've touched or not touched like we're making
1:23:13
equations and trying to figure this [ __ ] out But like at the end of it like we're
1:23:19
not in BC era We don't have to pick mates on how much they don't have to
1:23:24
because well you can go get pregnant by yourself as a woman without a man even being involved So I just feel like we're
1:23:30
at this point Well no you definitely can't get pregnant without a man being involved Well you got to have some sperm So I guess what I mean is without
1:23:36
intercourse or without worrying about where how many persons that man or woman have been with I just think that putting
1:23:43
value on a person because of body count is so not 2025 because like we don't
1:23:49
have to do that anymore Yeah But it's it's still part of a survival mechanism So for men or heterosexual men or
1:23:56
everybody Well I'll explain it Okay So human beings really quick before you take a sip We got to do a cheers and
1:24:01
then Oh cool Uh cheers Saloo to uh jungle Welcome to the jungle Thank you
1:24:07
Appreciate it man Woo So human beings are pattern recognition
1:24:13
machines That's how we live our lives Patterns change Just keep going Sorry to interrupt How do you know they change Um
It's a survival mechanism?!
1:24:19
that's evolution sir Right So so so you know patterns change because they don't fit the pattern that you're used to Yep
1:24:25
That's how right that would be the way So if you if you're a pattern recognition machine and you notice a
1:24:31
pattern between people who do in you know do this type of behavior right This is what I see with them people who do
1:24:37
this type of behavior this is what I see with them people etc etc etc etc the reason that's ingrained inside of you to
1:24:43
do to make those risk calculations is so that you can survive and thrive long term And every human being does this
1:24:49
like all of them I in ways I get Yeah But you know I just feel like as society
1:24:55
advances some of our mindset has to advance and change too because like we're not out here catching AIDS and
1:25:02
STDs as much as we used to because we have those STDs STDs are at an almost an
1:25:07
all-time high I believe Like they're increasing They're increasing In fact STDs we almost got rid of Yeah Are now
1:25:14
back with a bang That's interesting So that to me that says that more you know I may be wrong No this is just like a
1:25:20
personal opinion Like maybe if STDs are kind of on a rise or not going down I
1:25:25
mean it seems like promiscuity is in in a way because people who have STDs are
1:25:31
obviously still having sex and having sex and having sex So some consider it a
1:25:37
very important but there's there's reasons though right like it may be well there there could be trends you could
1:25:42
point to that promiscuity is going down actually but but what is going up is things like sex work and the amount of
1:25:49
people are involved in sex work that's a place where you would grab a lot of STDs and get them out to the
1:25:55
general public right your risk assessment for that is way way way higher so that's the case you wouldn't
1:26:00
actually need general societal promiscuity to go up just a small portion of the society to engage in
1:26:06
high-risisk behavior and then move it out That's what happened with HIV for instance right Same thing It was a small
1:26:12
subset of the population but they were heavily promiscuous that moved out to the the other subsets of the population
1:26:18
in a way Yeah Yeah I think it's also because there's a lack of sexual education in schools now Yeah Um No
1:26:24
there's not M well where I'm from I h I I took a sex ed class fourth grade just
1:26:30
because of puberty and I had one one semester of one in seventh grade but my high school never taught it My this
1:26:38
middle schools I used to go to they don't teach it anymore I don't know anyone who's younger than me who gets
1:26:43
taught sex ed anymore My son is 17 and he had no idea what that was He goes to a local high school and he's like no no
1:26:49
no one's teaching them condoms and STDs That's part of the general curriculum for most school It definitely should be I think it's so
1:26:56
it's the areas but also it's not like you know I've never really bought this the the there's not enough sexual
1:27:03
education in schools There was a huge primary campaign run on that throughout the '9s and in the early 2000s and it
1:27:09
didn't do anything Nothing And here's the thing convincing me that the average 13 to 15year-old doesn't know anything
1:27:16
about sex and maternity is [ __ ] insane You're going to learn things You can Google things now I I don't I I with
1:27:24
sex education and everything it's like you're not going to really understand a lot of it until you experience it or
Trauma COPE
1:27:30
make the mistakes and you won't even hear it anyway A lot of it too like trauma Trauma has a lot to do with
1:27:36
whether or not you're escaping in sex And that's at any age So you know you can tell someone all day long you
1:27:41
shouldn't do this you shouldn't do that but they're they're going to I think trauma is a cope I think that So what
1:27:47
here's what I think I think that a lot of women utilize the trauma excuse for their promiscuous past when they really
1:27:53
just wanted to get [ __ ] down by a stud and they what they do is they cope about it and they're like "No see the reason
1:27:59
that I went down and got [ __ ] down by so many studs is because my trauma that happened when I was when I was younger
1:28:06
this bad thing happened to me and that's what made it so that all these handsome men just had to [ __ ] me right Maybe the
1:28:13
younger ones the older ones are owning it." So I hang on So I hear that and I think to myself uh you know maybe not
1:28:19
Maybe it's not the fact that you were traumatized but the fact that you just wanted to have sex with a lot of
1:28:25
good-looking guys I mean that absolutely that can be that can be healing in ways
1:28:31
I think so that like if a guy said like "Oh I just had a really bad breakup and she really broke my heart." And you know
1:28:36
like "Oh I'm back on the streets." You know the boys will be like "Yeah yeah get back on the streets." You know but like when women do that like you said
1:28:42
it's kind of were you really hurt Like does this is that really a trauma response or are you just being wow Well
1:28:48
what it is Yeah it's coping What it is is they're going they're doing this They're going look
1:28:54
my dating chances drastically go down because I've slept with like and now the numbers areing astronomical like 50 60
1:29:01
70 guys right I've slept with that many guys When people when people realize that 60 70 [ __ ] I mean dudes Well you
1:29:09
got me Brian So clip and shift That's what they'll that Yeah That's what they'll say right Yeah And so if they do
1:29:16
right their their chances for having like the kind of more high status man especially in their 30s going to greatly
1:29:21
decrease in comparison to women who haven't So if that's the case like they have every reason to make an excuse to
1:29:28
cope about it to be like "No it's not my fault It was some trauma that I had that got treated." This type of thing Yes And
1:29:33
no it's um if you're still engaging in that behavior So if there's a quality man who's healed and he's ready for marriage and he's dating a woman who
1:29:40
obviously you can tell if someone still like doesn't love themselves and they're acting out and they're seeking love and
1:29:45
validation from other men then sure But if someone men get healed I think they get I think they get tired You can do it
1:29:52
Yeah I think they get tired I do we do NLP and hypnotherapy with my with my guys Hypnotherapy is [ __ ] There's a
1:29:58
little bit All it is is hypnotherapy All it is is that you go in and you can rewire reframe some memories so that
1:30:03
you're not as freaking loaded by the least scientific form of of especially
1:30:08
any sort of hypnosis But the thing is interesting about this is like they don't men it's not that men
1:30:16
uh are coping or get healed They're not healed They just get tired of it So playing the field for men who can right
1:30:23
It's fun for a little bit and they just get sick of it And it's not that they're healed from they weren't traumatized right They're like "What are they
1:30:29
traumatized from?" "Oh I had sex with a bunch of beautiful women Oh my god the trauma Oh the trauma." No that's not
1:30:35
where trauma comes from Of course they're not trauma That's not trauma right They're not trauma They're not traumatized by it all They're sick of it
1:30:41
right And they're the same thing with women They do get in some ways traumatized by women but mostly it's just they're sick of women's [ __ ]
1:30:47
right Well sure but that's not trauma Well what is trauma for them Trauma is when you're like if you're getting
1:30:54
actually abused beaten um hurt Like I've had clients that were like for men actually dated narcissistic women which
1:31:01
is surprising not surprising for me but a lot of people don't realize that men can be in abusive relationships right
1:31:07
psychologically abused physically abused Yeah And they can hold those scars over They can go through terrible divorces But no dating a bunch of women Yeah But
1:31:14
I'm talking when I talk trauma I I mean that I don't mean the superficial coping [ __ ] I mean actual Yeah the amount of
1:31:20
women who express that they've been traumatized and then you find out what they've been traumatized by is just the same regular roll [ __ ] that most every
1:31:27
human being has to go through I'm like that's not trauma that's cope Oh yeah cuz now right now with you see like
1:31:33
influencers right now I have such a grip with this one They they take the word trauma they take word narcissist they
1:31:39
take the word and they overuse it to the point where when you are actually having that or having trauma or having abuse
1:31:45
it's like it's gotten so blown out of proportion that you know the people who actually do need help or do actually have it Well actual narcissists are rare
1:31:51
And so what's happened is there's that every woman on planet Earth thinks she's a psychologist I have no idea why but
1:31:58
they read something online about narcissistic tendencies and traits and don't realize how common the the
1:32:04
miscalculation between confidence and narcissism is Oh that was a confident man who was assertive and aggressive in
1:32:09
his boundaries I don't like that So he's a [ __ ] narcissist It's like no that's not a narcissist Correct Yeah So that's
Therapy is not for men?
1:32:16
a that's a very common female cope Yeah I think that's I think that'll change when we have more
1:32:21
females talking to other females about that one Like no you can't you can't say that Becky How would that be the case
1:32:28
when like the whole field of psychology is completely inundated with women It's
1:32:33
like saturated with them and they mostly treat women Men don't usually seek
1:32:38
psychological help because they have the boys They go out with the boys They grab the coaches right They do that stuff
1:32:45
They're not grabbing many female coaches either They're grabbing They're grabbing their buddies They're grabbing their pals They're grabbing their groups Maybe
1:32:51
they might not tell you No most men are not I mean most men by the Yeah there's a lot just like most men by the numbers
1:32:57
boot camps all over the world with men right But what I'm saying is that they're not going to female psychologists They're not even really
1:33:04
going to No but that's why I'm saying I'm not a psychologist They have that like nice little I'm a coach So for me
1:33:09
if they're coming to me it feels a little bit less like oh I'm I'm not going to someone cuz I'm messed up I'm not going to a psychologist Although I
1:33:15
do encourage it I think there's talk therapy doesn't help with certain things but it's great to talk things out but
1:33:21
there's different modalities of like CBT or EMDR or you know whatever it is Um so
1:33:26
yeah I think most women seek out psychological assistance from psychologists so that they can learn various forms of manipulation in order
1:33:32
to manipulate whoever it is they're trying to manipulate and they want the assistance from somebody who's a professional at it Yeah Weaponizing So
1:33:38
it's weaponizing therapy talk right We have men that do that But anyone anyone who's traumatized who's not really or an
1:33:44
a-hole or whatever who's not willing to take a hard look at themselves oh they're gonna go in there they're I look at the numbers though and I look at the
1:33:50
numbers of women who seek psychologists versus men it's overwhelmingly women and it's overwhelmingly men women in the
1:33:55
field So can you always make the case oh the other sex also engages in that It's like yeah but to the degree of it it's
1:34:00
not even close Yeah Unless they Google it You can Google you can Google all day long and not have to go to someone and
1:34:06
spend money and $300 a pop to go to a psychologist to learn the jargon You could just Google it online True It's
1:34:12
everywhere on Instagram you know Well psychology is a study of the mind right I've never even considered I don't
1:34:18
consider it even scientific I never have It has scientific elements for data gathering and things like this but sure
1:34:24
it's not itself a science That's why it's considered a soft science Soft science Yeah I would just not science
1:34:31
They learn they learn they learn more and more It's it's nice that it grows I mean I remember back in the day when I was in psychology courses and they we
1:34:37
thought back then that you only use 10% of your brain And I mean that's what we learned back then They didn't know And
1:34:42
there's so much more It's just a growing because what happens is a sociological study will come out that has no
1:34:48
reputations to it Has not been replicated But because it's the most modern study everyone will reference it
1:34:54
as though it's gospel Within 2 years the reputation comes out But what Everybody inside of their mind they already have
1:34:59
this bad information Right Right Yeah They already have the bad information I still hear people say we only use 10% of
1:35:05
our brain I still hear people say that left-handed people are more creative I still hear people say that people with
1:35:11
blue eyes are generally taller I see people say all sorts I see people I see
1:35:16
people say all kinds of crazy [ __ ] right That has been refuted repudiated completely decimated for years and years
1:35:22
and years within the decade of reason They
1:35:32
stick with psychology It's a complete building block of lies Psychology But
1:35:37
that's the thing is that psychology isn't that building block of li It's the fact that you can take a zoom out and look at the fact that that's a pattern
1:35:43
We talked about patterns earlier Patterns do I do agree patterns actually repeat It's what human behavior doesn't
1:35:49
necessarily change our circumstances might or our the way things look might change but there's a pattern to that So
1:35:55
over the years every decade has some sort of bad information that gets you know caught up with but it's way worse
1:36:00
in sociology and psychology you're talking 60 70% of the studies suffer from the replication crisis All science
1:36:06
suffers from the replication crisis but the hard sciences very low when you go back to Yeah When you go back to
1:36:12
replicate a a chemistry experiment sure really easy You take this chemical this chemical this chemical you put in the
1:36:18
same conditions right The human element is very confounding especially when you're not studying the direct biological So they go out to replicate
1:36:25
the sociological studies like 70% in Canada it's worse Canada was worse was like 80% plus They couldn't replicate
1:36:32
the studies if they got the same participants the same scientists and and and
1:36:37
uh the same control conditions So it's like why the [ __ ] would I ever trust any science It's 80% wrong or 70% wrong or
1:36:43
60% wrong I don't know I I I do that too because I remember people were talking
1:36:48
about Freud for a long time and that guy was [ __ ] nuts I hated him Yeah But but wait a second He made psychotherapy
1:36:55
and he did a lot of hypnotherapy He did He did He did We took a lot of that and hopefully you grow Hopefully you learn
1:37:00
The one thing that I like about it is like hopefully you can take a mistake and learn from it and grow from it and do better But I mean there's there's
1:37:05
some cool elements Take what you like discard the rest you know and that's that's about it I think it goes back to
1:37:11
control because like what we were talking about with the body count thing and even this like it's unpredictable
1:37:17
You can't quantify it You can't hypnotize it Like we keep trying to put these calculable elements on dating and
1:37:26
love And like my mindset on it all is it's not like it doesn't matter how many people you've had sex with It doesn't
1:37:32
matter I won't say your trauma but like we're trying to calculate the human experience especially relationship wise
1:37:39
And it's incalculable Like you don't wake up and you say "I'm gonna eat eggs and I'm gonna eat eggs every day for the
1:37:44
rest of my life and I'm gonna have a pizza and I'm gonna be bad if I have pizza." You know like your genitals are
1:37:50
not one-time use Because if that was the case the first person you linked with or had sex with you would only be able to
1:37:56
orgasm with them You would only be able to procreate with them Like we have multi-use organs but we try to make them
1:38:03
single use or monogous And that's cool if you find that but I just feel like
1:38:09
biologically speaking we're not even biologically set up for Yeah But if you can't if you can do a thing it doesn't
1:38:15
mean you should do a thing Yeah I mean and that's very And not only that like I I think that you would even agree that
1:38:21
not really like there's a lot of calculable risks that you intuitively know Like you've heard this advice from your parents for instance right Don't
1:38:28
date someone who treats you bad Something simple right You would be looking for patterns for bad bad
1:38:33
treatment right So there's like no way around pattern recognition especially when it comes to dating and things like
1:38:39
this so that you can mitigate risk You go "Oh you're treating me bad Don't be if the person treats you bad." Right

people think I look really young Some people think I'm like 24 I'm like I'm not 24 I just turned 19 like not even a month ago So happy birthday Thanks So
1:42:06
does body count still matter for like your age group Cuz I'm old So I know right But then again as we get older we
1:42:13
don't care Even the guy I got to say this the guys that I coach honestly once they start healing and stuff they really
1:42:18
literally don't give a they don't care There's some people that will I'm sure of course And there's some people that
1:42:23
will but there's sometimes it's just you you just you you care about more about
1:42:28
the person Yeah I've honestly never encountered someone who was like "Oh I have an issue with body count." Now I don't date very often still I have not I
1:42:36
would prefer someone to have like the same body count as me if I'm going to date them seriously Well you're younger too I can't imagine a 19-year-old being
1:42:44
like "I've had 500 women." You're like "Yeah in what time In what time are you going to school Do you have hobbies?" If
1:42:51
you're dating like an older person who had like three times your body count I could see how that would be like that I would understand more like if I was
1:42:57
dating someone that was a few years older than me I understand they had But um perspective Yeah I
1:43:04
I'll thank you for that answer though That's Yeah you'll have some I'll have some So what what are the age
1:43:10
demographics for like most of your clients Cuz my I have two boys and once I get married we'll have eight boys in
1:43:16
between the two of us So just like as a future husband mom you know moms like
1:43:22
what are the age groups of clients that For me I coach anywhere from 18 to I
1:43:27
have a client uh in his 80s mid 80s I have a couple actually have a few clients in their mid 80s Oh my goodness
1:43:33
Yeah Like I've never heard of um a coach that handles that kind of thing Honestly I didn't either I didn't really know
1:43:39
about it I knew about Tony Robbins but I didn't know that I that this kind of thing existed I knew about pickup
1:43:45
artists a little bit Um but no I got sober eight years ago today Actually
1:43:51
today's my eighth year sobriety date Congratulations Thank you I just like took a cake for eight years and then
1:43:56
came here What What was your poison Uh uh alcohol and cocaine A And then pretty
1:44:01
much whatever anyone had in their hand It really wasn't I was like that whatever put it in me too Um do this
1:44:08
part But then uh I I was doing odd jobs I had a great resume but I was just I had to heal so much And then eventually
1:44:16
um I was debating on going back to getting my um masters and PhD Um but it just I didn't like the idea of being in
1:44:22
school for that long Um and so I just waited And then I had a friend of mine call and she was like "Hey we've got a
1:44:28
friend She's a dating coach for men I think you guys would be a great fit." Cuz I was always helping people I was always helping men I was always guiding
1:44:33
I was always giving advice right And then all of a sudden it was like "Oh my god this is a thing." And then honestly
1:44:38
when I started coaching is when I started really
1:44:44
massive I learned so much by coaching men I was like "Wo we're a lot more similar than I thought." And then I w up
1:44:51
continuing my education and doing like NLP and all that Yeah Can I tell you that I'm always I'll just be honest with
1:44:56
you I'm always skeptical of dating coaches Me too Are you kidding So I So
Dating coach SCAMS
1:45:01
they suck A lot of them opposite Sorry There's a lot of great ones So if I was let's say I woke up tomorrow right
1:45:06
meteorite hit my house and wife went through the wife she's dead right I'm single with my kids tomorrow I wouldn't
1:45:12
have a [ __ ] clue about the modern dating market and I wouldn't give a [ __ ] I would literally just give up I'm fine
1:45:18
with that Live the rest of my life in isolation on a mountain top somewhere and just enjoy the [ __ ] out of it I'm
1:45:24
fine with that Honestly sounds great But here's the thing is like when I when I talk to the dating
1:45:32
coaches it seems very scammy to me Yes It seems very much like uh they fluff
1:45:38
the resume for how many success stories they've really had It seems like they kind of fluff their experiences And
1:45:44
here's what I mean by this My dad gave me a great piece of advice when I was 14 years old He said "Never take financial
1:45:50
advice from someone who's broke." Right So if you're talking about dating coaches should people take advice from
1:45:57
single dating coaches Yeah it's dating I'm dating I'm in the pool but I also have amazing relationship I get that But
1:46:03
like doesn't that follow the same logic of like don't take financial advice from people who aren't rich but you you
1:46:11
answered it Would you take dating advice from someone who's dating you know who's in it who sees it but who's also had
1:46:17
good But also you're someone that discerns like you're someone that like for you personally you might not need it
1:46:22
because you're reading people you're you are an analyst you're not going to be as but the marriage like the marriage
1:46:27
aspect shows that you were successful in the dating right Oh yeah I do I mean yeah my shows like I was just like the
1:46:34
million dollars shows that you were successful in the financial market So it's like when you say well I'm in the
1:46:39
dating market I'm successful at dating It's like what's the prize of dating though Isn't it marriage Does that
1:46:45
generally be the prize Well what happens with a lot of them is um and I get this a lot So I'll have a program that's called from like toxic to triumph and I
1:46:51
do career as well too Like I do have multiple careers and I I I have success in there So I do get to pass that on Um
1:46:58
but the main thing is also like what I help a lot with is stop dating the toxic
1:47:03
ones the ones that you actually don't like you know So like all of them Yeah Right So a lot of them stay single for a
1:47:09
while know you're like a financial advisor but for love and relationships
1:47:14
and we do careers well too We do uh I get to unblock in in in there on like so
1:47:20
I I read and again this is my studies right so you take it with a grain of salt as well you should but uh some some
1:47:28
some data is better than others uh that you can judge better than others like if it comes from a dating website it's
1:47:33
usually fairly good it's not great but it's usually fairly good there's less bias things like this um but one thing
1:47:40
is like there used to be dating placement agencies so what they would do and there they still exist Yeah they
1:47:46
still exist Yeah Yeah Is that they would just like link people up for dates right And then you know let the chips fall
1:47:52
where they may When it came to the track record of those agencies versus straight dating coaches those agencies had a way
1:47:59
better track record because what they were doing is putting people with people with people with people And it's like
1:48:05
it's it's the natural course that if you run into more people your chances for success increase versus decrease right
1:48:12
So they come to me when they go to those pools but they keep picking the ones that don't work out Then we find out why
1:48:18
you're picking you know this person over here versus if you actually want a quality woman who you're aligned with
1:48:25
who you would get married to but yet you keep dating the ones that are you know having good times with the island boys
1:48:30
like what why do you keep getting around those So we identify why are you around those women that are in those parties
1:48:36
versus if you want a quality woman where would you go And then I could point him back to like well go to this dating pool
1:48:42
or go to this one or do this one or tweak your bio this way You know you think men or women are better at dating coaching for men
1:48:48
I I think both honestly I think as long as you you know what you're doing and you care cuz I I think men or women
1:48:53
would be better dating coaches for women I again I mean for all right look for me
1:49:01
personally if if if it's a guy and he's wanting advice on a woman you're going
1:49:07
to you're we read we read women a little bit faster but for me like there are a couple my girlfriends that I'll go to
1:49:13
cuz they they they speak dude and I'm I'll go to them they give it to me straight there's no fluff but if I'm
1:49:18
dating someone or if I have questions about it because I have my own blind sides right I have my own like things that'll come up I'm going to go to a guy
1:49:24
cuz guys you guys do read men a lot faster You think it you you are in it So I typically I I do like that But I'll
1:49:32
I'll go to both and hear like what they both have to say But So I mean it would stand it so it stands to reason to you
1:49:38
that men know men better Women know women better Yeah I I can't say that like as a complete thing cuz you you
1:49:44
know you can you you know you can read women and there's women that can read Well there's an interesting phenomenon here that's interesting right This is
1:49:50
why I ask Yeah What are you setting me up for Well I'm not even setting you up It's just it's just this is this is a
1:49:56
trend that's that I see a lot If I ask a female dating coach and they answer both ways right Usually female dating coaches
1:50:03
will actually say women are just better to go to period when it comes to dating coaching because um you know the advice
1:50:09
for women it's better and then the advice you get from men they don't you know um it's not as good right They
1:50:15
they'll just kind of phrase it this way Yeah Now there's some who like you will say "Well you should go to to men if
1:50:22
you're a woman because they're going to read men better or you should go to a woman um if you're a man cuz they're
1:50:28
going to read women better." Right But here's the problem that comes up is that women are way worse at holding elongated
1:50:34
relationships with each other than men are with each other With friendships Friendships What does that have to do
1:50:39
with relationships Well that's what's interesting right Is like everything all of these aspects are interpersonal So it
1:50:45
just means interpersonal dynamics right Correct So a friendship is still it's an
1:50:50
interpersonal dynamic and friendships actually take in some cases more work
1:50:56
than than a relationship My longest right now I just messaged with her over 20 years right But what I'm saying is
1:51:01
like men I agree with that I think that you should look at what are your relation but men do generally better in interpersonal relationships than women
1:51:07
do Shouldn't men and women both go to men for relationship advice I think it just depends on the person interpersonal
1:51:13
relationships with women and men I mean we're not going to go down on the street and just grab any man and be like "Help me with my dating advice." Like I I
1:51:20
think it just depends on you know if the guy if the guy is good he's good If the girl's good she's good you know but
1:51:25
again you're going to be able to read them and just read them and hopefully they're not full of I go to my girlfriends you know my my friends who
1:51:32
are female for more emotional um you know like social advice you know
1:51:38
not that we are not intellectual because duh we are But if I was having a relationship issue especially since I
1:51:43
date girls mostly then I would maybe go to my guy friends or something like that for more like
1:51:49
analytical advice Like I feel like y'all see it from that um more you said primal
1:51:55
earlier I'm going to use that phrase but because it kind of fits but not really But I feel like men see the world and
1:52:01
women and relationships for more of that like primal thing like how do I mate How do I you know provide those things and
1:52:09
then women see it more from like that emotional like you know how do I make sure I have a loving partner How do I
1:52:15
find a supporting partner Things like that So I think again we just go for me it goes back to love and dating is
1:52:22
uncalculable So I think I think that what are you looking for One of the best piece of advices in modernity for men
1:52:28
right and you can you can love this or hate this is that generally speaking taking advice from women about anything
1:52:35
is a terrible idea Basically always a terrible idea and it's what women are
1:52:41
you around who hurt you See what I mean Like that like the the feminist comes
1:52:46
out right away right So who hurt you The idea the idea of who hurt you comes down to your blanket idea your psychological
1:52:53
training of trauma right You you assume that there must be some trauma There's not trauma It's just pattern recognition
1:52:59
No but it' be your pattern recognition Everyone's got a different pattern right Because you do have a lot of guys that
1:53:04
like if they grew up with a lot of women then they actually do tend to go towards more women And if they had like a if
1:53:09
they had bad right But if they had a bad relationship like I have a lot of guys that um if they had abuse from men or
1:53:15
bullying from men they actually don't trust me Immediately to a trauma analysis rather than a logical analysis
1:53:20
That would be logical That would be logic No logic 1 plus 1 equals two If my friend group of men is mean and I go to
1:53:26
them and they give me bad advice then I'm not going to go to them That's logic That's 1 plus 1 equals two Yeah Yeah That No Well hang on There's a
1:53:33
distinction when you use a analysis a trauma analysis meaning the first the
1:53:39
very first thing you said to me is who hurt you Was that the first thing I think we've already analy said something
1:53:45
the second I said something you disagree with it was who hurt Now you'll find this trend with women right The second
1:53:51
you say you make a claim that they think is effective women as a category instant
1:53:56
trauma response Must be trauma Who hurt you What happened to you Emotional what is this thing that uh that triggered
1:54:03
this right And it's like actually there doesn't always have to be a thing In fact there most most often isn't You can
1:54:08
just use logic and reason to assess the situations around you based around the social relationships people have and
1:54:14
determine that women usually give really [ __ ] bad advice especially to each other Especially to each other Uh but
1:54:21
men generally speaking especially older men tend to give really good advice And they usually tend to solicit it right
1:54:27
Only when you're asked them for it And it's usually pretty good Women often will give advice nobody [ __ ] asked
1:54:32
for right Nobody asked for it They don't care about it but they can't wait to give it to you So it's like um what I
1:54:39
see with the pattern is that generally speaking women give terrible advice to women and men And men tend to give
1:54:44
especially if they're older men fairly good advice to the people who ask them for advice That's just what I see as a
1:54:49
trend So if I see that as a trend of course my logical brain says most men and women probably shouldn't go towards
1:54:56
women for for advice They probably just shouldn't do that It's probably not a good idea I'm going to let you guys
1:55:02
respond I'm going to let you guys respond But we have a another champagne pop and we still need to do a cheers

1:56:52
the jungle Thank you Um I'll I'll fill up if they need some later Okay Um did
1:56:57
you guys want to continue on the You were talking about dating Yeah Yeah Well I was just I was I was pretty much done there I just said that's the pattern
1:57:03
that I've noticed is that women generally and I here's the thing I don't just see that I don't see this in one
1:57:09
occupation I see this across occupational boards Like for instance women are often in HR departments and
1:57:15
they usually make things 200,000 times worse for everybody because they're in HR departments And it's just awful
1:57:21
They're just awful at HR departments But why are women in HR departments Cuz normal like I think that kind of goes
1:57:27
back to like the systemic change We're in HR That's all we can do right Yeah
HR is BAD?!
1:57:32
I'll explain I'll explain why I'll explain why in HR departments um they're
1:57:37
problematic especially when it comes to men So HR Yeah Yeah That's I'm I'm going
1:57:43
to tell you this is true When you go to a human resources department they have
1:57:49
psychological training courses that they often go through And during the
1:57:54
psychological training courses they're taught to use a specific tone which is designed around the feminine Just like
1:58:01
in school in schools men are disadvantaged Boys are disadvantaged because it's usually a feminine curriculum And that's why women excel in
1:58:09
school men don't They have a feminine curriculum this idea of like sit at the table have your hands folded listen
1:58:16
quietly while the teacher's teaching Men don't do that [ __ ] They want to throw stuff at each other and be obnoxious
1:58:22
They want to throw stuff at each other I know I'll push back on that though There's plenty of men who do great in school though We used to see that a lot
1:58:28
more Women women excel in comparison because of the the rules which are there right So for instance um when I was
1:58:35
younger you got into a fist fight It was not it was maybe suspendable It was not a police arrest you and you go to jail
1:58:41
Yeah Sure Yeah I came home with a black eye and bloody nose I lost That's all that that meant Or unless he had more
1:58:47
bruises or something You could that you could have won on that one Yeah But even but the point is is like nobody gave a
1:58:52
[ __ ] It wasn't like oh my god these kids they started knocking each other around Oh my go the cops Well I think once
1:58:57
there was more shootings and it wasn't there was there was a massive amount of gang violence inside schools before any
1:59:04
of that like mass stuff started happening Right Yeah but still men
1:59:09
especially young men learn differently than women but because they're inside of like a very feminine zone they actually
1:59:16
can't excel the same way they do in like all boys schools and things like this where they excel much better Um what's
1:59:22
interesting is in HR departments since they're always inundated with women right It's always from the feminine
1:59:28
perspective too So men let me tell you some things that men hate Can we have a little conversation Every man who hears
1:59:35
that does this Oh god can you just come down and lightning Zeus lightning bolt
1:59:41
me through the [ __ ] chest Please do that so I don't have to go in to this
1:59:46
room I think women have that too The moment we hear any of that [ __ ]
1:59:52
insufficient how about how about this one as a woman I agree We don't we ate that [ __ ] So what we're going to do here
1:59:58
is a little bit of coaching We're going to do a little bit of coaching I don't talk like that or how about we're going to you know we I'm just here to assist
2:00:04
you with some of the problems that we've been seeing you having And they have their little like [ __ ] stupid post-it
2:00:09
notes and [ __ ] Every guy on planet Earth right Even the most like cringe dude
2:00:16
thinks of the second they hear that all they can think of in their head is this And this is what's on repeat right Now
2:00:22
you can believe me or not believe me but this is what's on repeat Shut up [ __ ] Shut up [ __ ] Shut up [ __ ] Shut up [ __ ] Please shut up [ __ ] Please shut
2:00:28
up That's all they're thinking on repeat Now me saying that out loud to a group
2:00:33
of women you think you think even right now man that's harsh That's actually kind of harsh But it's like that's
2:00:38
actually how we think about it It's like please can this end How quickly can this
2:00:44
end But do you think that that's why that tone is being made Because a confrontation cuz I feel like men can only hold it in before they go they lose
2:00:51
it you know And so it's like they have to take a softer tone almost like I don't want to say speaking to a child
2:00:56
but just being softer to create this open space No no See I I think that that misses the whole point And that's the
2:01:02
feminine prism too right They don't actually give a [ __ ] What they really want to say to you is like everything
2:01:08
that you're about to tell me I don't give a [ __ ] about any of it I don't care It means nothing to me I'm only trying
2:01:14
to get through this meeting as far as I can to keep this job but everything coming out of your mouth I literally
2:01:20
don't give a [ __ ] about That's what they actually are thinking in their brains I think women in that in that circumstance
2:01:26
are also thinking the same thing Uh hold on Hold on Uh going to you uh you are
2:01:31
not enjoying what Andrew is saying True Oh my god Uh what are your what are
2:01:39
your thoughts The reason why she doesn't date America Oh I was thinking why you
2:01:45
could make such conclusions like without giving any examples like you need to
2:01:51
like support your own opinions But even his examples would be so if you're
2:01:56
asking for like data for these examples right now this is an anecdotal conversation Yeah So I I preface this
2:02:02
conversation by saying this is based on the pattern recognition experiences that I've seen Yeah Not preferencing it on
2:02:08
like oh I have a massive data packet here that's sociological in nature probably will never be replicated in
2:02:14
order to uh show my findings that this is what men think But based on all the conversations that I've had with men and
2:02:20
I've had thousands of them all ac across the world same thing with women this is what they think Sure But there will be
2:02:26
something called confirmation bias in this as well too Yeah The thing is though is like I think pattern
2:02:33
recognition assists with eliminating confirmation bias That's what it's there for The confirmation bias is because you
2:02:38
wouldn't be able to assess your own like patterns and your own confirmation bias in it or awareness of it if you
2:02:46
understand what I'm saying with that one But sorry I don't want to take a conversation Well you're good But let's let's just talk about it from the
2:02:51
ideological You can hold ideologies which are false based on confirmation bias like you're talking about Many
2:02:58
people do until they are moved into a position where their ideology is tested and doesn't fit with the pattern Then
2:03:04
they enter cognitive dissonance because their confirmation confirmation by a shatter is based on new pattern
2:03:09
recognition hope What actually doesn't happen unless they're like forced to recognize it and forced to face the
2:03:15
information Now what we see in dating is confirmation bias is huge If you have a
2:03:20
belief system that all women all men are [ __ ] or nothing or all women are toxic I'm sorry but if you put if you put
2:03:27
someone in a room full of quality people or nice people they'll they'll make it up in their head You will make it up in
2:03:33
your head You will actually physically hear it differently and you will repeat it back differently You can ask someone
2:03:38
with confirmation never say that the idea of like all women are [ __ ] No no I
2:03:44
was giving an example that you I know you didn't say that Like in these monolithic tones but I do think but we
2:03:50
generalize that Yeah of course we generalize But that's part of pattern recognition is generalization And that's
2:03:55
what but that's a good one to recognize I'm generalizing So my pattern is is that I'm I'm generalizing and I'm seeing
2:04:00
these people and I'm putting them in No I'm generalizing based on patterns So I would just say like for instance uh I
2:04:06
don't get in very many car accidents So I think driving is pretty safe for me That would be a pattern that I would
2:04:11
recognize Right But if you were to see the But if I were to Well how about just I were to be moved to a large city where
2:04:17
there was massive traffic congestion and now suddenly I'm driving a lot more and I'm getting into more accidents I might
2:04:24
enter into like oh [ __ ] my preassion about driving being safe is actually driving is only safe under these
2:04:30
circumstances right If that happened but you could also go to that big city and suddenly only drive like you know 2 p.m
2:04:35
when there's no traffic So you could absolutely still hold that belief system to do right But that makes my
2:04:41
point for me that the ideology unless presented with new patterns is going to hold still based on pattern recognition
2:04:47
Yes Based on pattern but that's why it's on the individual as well too So you said like women are like less um like
2:04:53
not not available but reliable for like advice and stuff Like for me it's much different like growing up in the south
2:05:00
like my mom and my grandmother and my aunties like those powerful women were the ones leading the family like giving
2:05:06
advice cooking all the meals and like I couldn't really name maybe like one or two males that really had a dramatic
2:05:14
impact on my life where I would say like oh yeah like like well I need you to remember this though that I didn't actually say who was more available for
2:05:21
advice No that that was a bad that was bad What I said was who has better ones I would actually go to for advice For me
2:05:27
it wouldn't be a man because I actually said women are more available a lot more available for advice A lot more like
2:05:34
depends on the subject I think it depends on what you're asking them advice on because women would be experts
2:05:39
on makeup for example like stereotypically raising kids stereotypically You know here's the
2:05:44
thing Why the [ __ ] would a guy go to a girl for advice on makeup We can answer that We're in LA Give me an example Like
2:05:51
women aren't but I mean let's actually let's actually dive into like the examples right So the example of like
2:05:57
makeup Guys aren't going to go to [ __ ] women for advice on makeup They don't wear anything Like when women go to other women for advice it's on their
2:06:03
expertise What What would men be going to women for advice for how to get women That's about it Well
2:06:11
when you think about it like let's break it down A woman There's not actually that much for men to go to women for
2:06:17
advice on So if they wanted to talk to very wealthy people plenty of men who are very wealthy usually more wealthy
2:06:22
than women If it was going to come down to an occupational like skills there's no way women are going to get better
2:06:29
advice on electrical roofing you know concrete mixing It depends Just like makeup was one of them It doesn't depend
2:06:35
What What woman are you going to go to for advice on on mixing concrete Come on Well some women would be better at sales
2:06:42
specifically Sales It depends Yeah Yeah But but here's the thing Even then right Wouldn't you if you were a man go "Okay
2:06:48
well there's some disadvantages I have immediately like I don't have boobs and I'm not cute and I don't have this and I don't have that." You're going to go to
2:06:54
who for the best advice on how to sell [ __ ] as a man Men I think you're going to go with Yeah someone that looks like
2:06:59
you that that way you're like "How do you do what you do with that part?" I agree with advice for women on if
2:07:06
they're the person you're trying to sell to You get advice on being better at sales through that That would be market
2:07:13
research Yeah Except the most successful marketers on planet Earth were men I bet
2:07:19
they probably asked and they got the entire planet to smoke and they got the entire planet to do all of these other things which are This isn't the greatest
2:07:26
argument right now Well actually well actually I'm kidding Imagine you like
2:07:31
imagine all the bad but you said good advice Well you do that Well imagine that you can actually get through
2:07:37
crafted um through like crafted propaganda the whole population to smoke That was men who were able to at least
2:07:43
craft that propaganda It worked for men and women Yeah So it's like and they weren't like and by the way that was
2:07:49
like the most misogynistic society ever they weren't I think that's the what she said was that men were the first ones
2:07:55
who can get in that role and I think that so they have you know they're a step ahead of women that's changing like
TERRIBLE at marketing
2:08:02
now like I'm an executive chef when you wouldn't really see executive chefs in a female role like now my fiance is a
2:08:08
pilot like women are terrible at marketing let me give you some
2:08:15
ad do you remember Budlight Budlight had a massive controversy where they put where they put Mulaney on a Bud Light
2:08:21
beer can right And then lost the entire market share of Bud Light Spearheaded by
2:08:28
a woman right Spearheaded by a woman trying to sell this beer Not because she
2:08:33
understood Dylan a woman What's that Well that depends on cuz I know a little
2:08:38
bit about your background that I I'm assuming you don't see Dylan Mulaney as a woman Yeah I see the woman in charge
2:08:43
of the marketing campaign is a woman Okay The woman in charge of the marketing campaign who had a vagina is
2:08:49
definitely a woman Yeah By any criteria I can think of Okay I didn't know if you're talking about Dylan specifically
2:08:55
or if your opinion sit the person who put Dylan on the can Okay That was a female in charge of that Completely
2:09:02
[ __ ] it all up Right There's multiple marketing campaigns actually I can point to that spearheaded that they [ __ ] up
2:09:07
because they don't take in the male element They take in the female element That was a campaign I think that that's something to learn for sure I'm sure we
2:09:13
can point to men failures as well too You know what I mean on marketing But there's but there was a study that did
2:09:19
come out and I can't remember the guy's name so I haven't gotten to say it Um but he just uh there's studies that have come out and we can debate it or
2:09:26
whatever but um apparently women make excellent CEOs and better CEOs No they don't that's not that's on there's data
2:09:33
on that one No but you can look on that one else There's also data there's also
2:09:38
data on this There's also data that says that if you have corporations that do diversity hires they actually do better
2:09:44
than corporations that don't That was a study that came out that I was just debating the other day till I came into
2:09:50
the debate with all of the modern reputations to the study based on of course the new evidence which emerged
2:09:56
when they went back to replicate that study Turns out those companies were already doing great They just had so much money they were able to start
2:10:02
playing Costco There was tons There was a bunch of Fortune 500 S&Ps They just
2:10:07
had so much money that they were able to start playing around with this model It wasn't that that model made them rich
2:10:14
They were already [ __ ] rich They just had enough money that they can start playing with the model What's the term for that That's uh Damn I'm blinking No
2:10:22
no no You know when like something looks like it's coming from this There we go It was a correlation not a causation Correct Exactly They actually said like
2:10:30
they took a coralate They took a correlate and then asked pretended it was a causation when it wasn't to affirm
2:10:35
a bias So the thing is is like anytime I look at this stuff right I realize that
2:10:41
when it whenever it's led by empathy first which women usually lead their morality by empathy first it's usually a
2:10:47
massive failure It's usually a massive failure I I hope that they mix both I think that we can learn from both men
2:10:52
and women I agree because I think that if a woman's just coming in and she's only looking the empathy then yeah absolutely you're losing it But if a guy
2:10:58
is coming in he's only looking at one thing as well too I think that you know yeah if you open yourself up and think
2:11:04
about different things and new ways of attacking I wouldn't dispute that I wouldn't dispute the idea that there's going to be some So I wouldn't monolith
2:11:11
anything I wouldn't say anything's always an all of anything But if we look at general trends what we say is that women lead with empathy first right Men
2:11:19
tend to lead with reason first Yeah When I coach differently like if I coach women I have to get them to like stop
2:11:26
with feeling stuff It's I just need you forward motion But with men I need them stop forward motion because you're
2:11:31
making mistakes and not assessing So I need you intuitive So men can listen to your gut You've done it and you and you
2:11:37
said it can w you right now could look look at someone or look at someone's profile and intuitively kind of know based on logic based on things based on
2:11:44
whatever but you could know who that person is what they're about to do or say or or what not or if they're a good
2:11:49
person decent person or I've had I've had significant but I've had significant advantages of having of of of having
2:11:57
tons and tons of interpersonal conversations with thousands of different people all over the place
2:12:02
right so it helps your intuition I have significant advantages that the general public would not have when it came to to
2:12:09
understanding what people are saying why they're saying it what type of worldview they're leading from Yeah Most people don't have that No And because they
2:12:16
don't right it's easy enough for me to just say look generally women do lead with empathy Yes And generally men do
2:12:22
lead with reason Yes If that's the case right Who the [ __ ] would you want in charge of every situation Probably the
2:12:28
sex I want the person either one that's unlocked both So for a man if he's got
2:12:34
intuition what advantage does empathy give you over reason Intuition Think about it as intuition No no not
2:12:39
intuition That's not my question What advantage Oh yeah If a man if a man has
2:12:45
empathy if a man has uh is able to forward motion plus empathy I feel like
2:12:50
he's lethal What How What is What does the empathy give him in the marriage
2:12:55
Other things like if you're in the dating pool a woman's going to look for a man who has empathy as well as strength EQ But if you have reason
2:13:02
couldn't she just fake the empathy Who's faking empathy Who is going to get married to someone who's been faking for
2:13:07
that long And you usually can spot red flags So like the idea I'll give you I'll give you this great example of this
2:13:13
right And almost probably every man will do this where his woman comes to him with some stupid [ __ ] problem he
2:13:19
doesn't give a [ __ ] about but she does right She cares about it for whatever reason and it's literally [ __ ]
2:13:24
meaningless Totally meaningless Means nothing Totally irrelevant Totally nonsensical Nobody on planet Earth gives
2:13:31
a [ __ ] He's like this He goes "It's okay honey." Right now in his mind I'm going to tell you what he's thinking What he's
2:13:36
thinking in his head is "God this is [ __ ] stupid And I hope that you just stop with this [ __ ] [ __ ] in the next
2:13:42
20 minutes That would be great I got other [ __ ] to do I can't even believe that you're hysterical about this This
2:13:47
is They're faking empathy
2:13:52
Hold up We have to do that too No It's called a relationship."
2:13:59
No no I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm kidding on that one Don't jump down my throat on that Are you actually that way
Selective empathy
2:14:04
with your wife sometimes Like like there's been times where my wife for instance right Just like every woman on
2:14:10
planet Earth she's been on her period completely irrational right Says some stupid ass [ __ ] [ __ ] and I've told her things like "Go to your room."
2:14:16
Literally go to your room and take a [ __ ] nap until you can act and take an act like a [ __ ] human being Go to
2:14:22
your room and take a [ __ ] nap I hope she Does she she speaks to you She goes to her room and she takes a [ __ ] nap
2:14:28
And the next thing I know she acts like a rational human being Does she speak to you that way too though And and I mean that in a good way But is she Do you
2:14:35
guys get to communicate like Let us Well let us pretend Let us pretend for a moment Cuz I'm Italian so we talk like
2:14:40
that as women too in our families Yeah I'll respond to this So I'm just saying that I'll respond to this I'll respond to this Let us pretend for a moment that
2:14:46
what for a week out of every month I completely lost my [ __ ] mind due to
2:14:52
hormones and started like oh I don't know ripping doors off of hinges I'm sure she probably wouldn't be very
2:14:57
pleasant about that Yes Exactly But guess what But guess what She's like "Go take a break." Because because because
2:15:03
I'm not I don't have what is called hormonal lunacy once a month You don't have to worry about that Men lead with
2:15:08
reason So no Of course my wife my wife's not going to talk to me like that Maybe you might have some reason but you you
2:15:15
suppress emotions and you emotionally explode and anger You're supposed to suppress emotions Yes Absolutely Go for
2:15:21
it Suppress men out there Suppress And then suppress You don't want to see what happens Push it down You only allow
2:15:27
horniness and anger Yes Really quick before I move this on You've been grimacing the entire week I know I know
2:15:34
We got And she had such a great point He's not been happy Yeah What What do
2:15:41
you think about this this terrible misogynist
2:15:46
All the misogynist can't believe what I've just heard Terrible Yeah I know Yeah That's exactly why I don't turn to
2:15:52
men for help or emotional support What did he actually say like he doesn't care
2:15:58
about what the girl is talking about like her feelings saying like lunacy hysterical all these words like even
2:16:05
hysteria the word esmologically is like anti- women like it's made up by men to
2:16:11
saying women are crazy so I don't know do women let me ask you a question do
2:16:16
men get periods no they do change hormonally we've
2:16:22
noticed not like that they have hormonal frequencies do women hang on do Women do women one time per month have massive
2:16:29
hormonal changes which affect literally how they think
2:16:35
Not everybody Not every woman You can actuallyot You can actually have smaller Why do I turn to women for help
2:16:43
It's because like when I feel really sad I need to have emotional support Yeah You want them to lie to you Yeah You
2:16:49
want them to lie to you I can calm down and then like I can reason myself I can think it through And also see we don't
2:16:55
want them to be lying to us We want them to have genuine empathy which they don't They lie Women lie to us We all lie
2:17:01
That's fine No we all do lie Of course I don't even care We'll come right back to this I need to this chat I'm very sorry
2:17:07
I missed it Or a TTS came in 25 minutes ago I apologize Normally we're on top of these but I missed it 21 donated $200
2:17:15
Thank you man I apologize High body count Six plus Have a greater likelihood of cheating Relationship dissatisfaction
2:17:23
can't pair bond depression and it's just disgusting Why would any guy want that
2:17:29
Actually the last part of what that chatter said is the most important part And it's just disgusting That's all that
2:17:36
needs to be If it is the case from the man's prism that it's revolting and preferences are fine to have then that's
2:17:42
that's no Sure Absolutely You don't need any preference Your preference your preference but that preference is changing
2:17:48
where men feel like it's okay for them where if a woman has a higher body count it's a no I think that that's where a
2:17:55
disconnect and it just doesn't seem like fair Here's the thing Well let me ask you a question Uh you go on first dates
First dates
2:18:02
Yeah of course I go on first dates When's the last time you've been on a first date It's been a while Uh how many
2:18:08
first dates have you have you been on Um in my ripe age I'm not really sure I I'll say maybe in the last year I've
2:18:14
gone on I don't know eight dates Okay Who paid Who paid for the dates Um the men
2:18:21
have Mhm Did you offer um one time Yes And I actually paid and the guy decided
2:18:26
not to get anything Yeah And then but you said wait and he didn't pay for anything He didn't ask for anything when
2:18:32
I offered to pay So I was like all right getting my own thing So I mean we can discuss about what's fair what's unfair
2:18:38
or double standards or benefits that men receive benefits that women receive male
2:18:43
privilege female privilege Uh you seem to have a double standard as it relates to who pays on the first date So what's
2:18:49
the actual problem I don't think it's a double standard I think that do you pay for dates I I have Okay Other than the
2:18:55
fact that he didn't order anything I was very willing to pay Okay So seven of the eight dates that you went on just this
2:19:01
year the man paid for the man paid for all of them Yes Because he asked me out on a date and I was like "Sure." Do you
2:19:07
ask men out on dates No Oh okay So conveniently it's just very convenient
2:19:12
this whole men should pay on dates Whoever asks should or excuse me whoever asks should be the one who pays on dates
2:19:19
But women conveniently never ask men on dates So your argument as to who if if
2:19:24
your argument is whoever asks should pay would make sense to me if men and women
2:19:30
asked each other out at equivalent rates but they clearly don't So you're kind of going around the bush as to uh beating
2:19:37
around the bush or not beating I'm actually interested in how this correlates to my thing about why is it
2:19:43
okay for sure Sure So here here's the example So you were saying well it's kind of uh okay for men to have a high
2:19:50
body count but when women have a high body count there's an issue with it So there's a double you claim there's a double standard that exists right Yes
2:19:57
Right And you might say for example as follows If a guy himself has a high body
2:20:02
count it would be unfair or unreasonable or hypocritical or a double standard for
2:20:07
as a man with high body count to desire a woman who has a low body count Oh [ __ ]
Should preferences be SHAMED?
2:20:13
So definitely he can desire someone I just don't think it should be shamed like oh it's disgusting We're not I
2:20:19
don't think we're talking about well to use that term disgusting to describe a person because of their human experience
2:20:26
Disgusting for the women No I'll explain it So for example uh body count sort of
2:20:31
moves it far away from what uh sexual encounter actually is So for example uh
2:20:38
and there could be differentials here You'll probably respond like "Oh well a woman could have a high body count but
2:20:43
she's been celibate for 3 years." But I'd point to it like this For example here's how it's disgusting If a woman
2:20:49
slept with a a different guy the night before and she goes on a date with me and I sleep with her that's disgusting
2:20:56
to you to to most men That's going to be disgusting If a woman in recently slept
2:21:03
with another man especially if she [ __ ] him without a condom especially if he she let him come inside her Can I
2:21:11
say why Can I just ask why Why do you know that Well I mean why is it disgusting Biologically socially or
2:21:18
emotionally What is disgust All of the above Okay Can we break those down
2:21:23
Maybe Sure Actually let's just start with Let's start with the biological Personally I actually wouldn't disagree
2:21:29
with you Now although I have gone on dates and things like that I would not disagree with you I just mean in general
2:21:34
I just want to know why it's okay She I know she wants to discuss it but I don't disagree If she was with somebody went
2:21:40
raw he came in her whatever and then goes on another date and then that's going to happen the very next day with a
2:21:45
new person I'm not in disagreement with that The main point I was going to say here is is that when it comes to the
2:21:51
unfairness I think you're pointing towards the double standard or the potential hypocrisy Now the thing is my
2:21:56
view is when it comes to both men and women we are allowed to desire things in a partner traits uh in a partner that we
2:22:04
ourselves don't possess So for example I I wouldn't find it uh a double standard
2:22:10
necessarily or hypocritical if a woman who was poor was attracted to and dated
2:22:16
and or wanted to date really rich men I don't think that that would be hypocritical or double standard So a guy
2:22:23
who has a high body count for example I don't think it would be hypocritical or a double standard if despite him having
2:22:29
high body count he wants to he has a preference for women with a low body count I think it's different because I
2:22:34
think it's how would it be different I think because it's morally like if you're loose with yourself with other
2:22:40
people then you know maybe the person that doesn't have as much money that like your your example was if a poor
2:22:46
girl Okay No no no go ahead I have a response though Go Okay Sure So like if your your example is like okay there's
2:22:52
this poor girl or somebody who's maybe just like a server She doesn't make a ton of money She wants to date someone who makes six figures who knows whatever
2:22:59
a multi-millionaire I don't think that that's the same morally maybe she hasn't had the same opportunities to somebody
2:23:04
who a guy that sleeps around Okay So I'll respond to that So are you stating
2:23:10
that when it comes to preferences people are only entitled to having preferences
2:23:15
as it relates to morals Because women have uh one last thing and I'll let you respond Women have plenty
2:23:21
of preferences for men that have nothing to do with morals Uh and they do and they also have
2:23:27
preferences that do relate to just relation relationally even to just attraction Right It sounds like we went off topic from shaming someone Not
2:23:34
really like we're still on I think it's still somewhat on topic flow So go ahead
2:23:40
I'm going to let this come in but then Murphy donated $200 Thank you Christopher Murphy Sorry for the delay You can't reason with these women They
2:23:47
are driven by emotion and are therefore unreasonable Reason and logic push society ladies not your feelings That
2:23:55
sounds like an emotional response But when you go home right Cuz when you go home you want that woman with feelings
2:24:00
You don't want a woman that sits there and is analytical You don't come home to a pair of boobs that are hard as rocks
2:24:06
You come home to a soft do And you know I mean like like I think there's a
2:24:11
balance There's just that balance that we have to you make well you make a a fine point I would just give the quick
2:24:17
reputation before Brian and uh the gal get back into it The only thing I would say is this It is the case you are right
2:24:23
that men are perfectly happy to have women who lead with emotion in their life if they submit to them Yeah I mean
2:24:30
like I'm more masculine my relationship and my current partner and fiance She's more feminine and she definitely like
2:24:36
she submits she submits to me because like I I mean she makes but she makes more money than me as a pilot and me as
2:24:42
like a chef and doing like more gig work and stuff like that So has nothing to do with what submission is ultimately but
2:24:47
well no I definitely know that but I just mean like did you want to continue If you don't
2:24:53
mind just repeating I kind of lost track of the You guys were focused on whether
2:24:58
or not it was hypocrisy Brian there was a focus on the higher body count I think that versus women I mean I think that if
2:25:06
longterm you're looking for somebody like obviously you're going to want to connect on moral things on compatibility
2:25:12
is a you know some a factor in in a long-term relationship So yeah I think that if you're going to be not asking
2:25:18
but looking for the preference of somebody who has a lower body count you yourself should not have been like a hoe as a man Well let me see if I can make a
2:25:24
response to this by just asking you a simple question Would it be a deal breaker for you if you met a man and he
2:25:31
had all the right criteria he was um a millionaire perhaps uh he he met the
2:25:37
attractiveness scale that you wanted if he had slept with 150 women but he wanted to settle down with you I think
2:25:42
he was if he was ready to settle down then that's fine as long as he's clean and now it's just him and I were married So that wouldn't be a dealbreaker Right
2:25:48
Right Okay But for men that's a deal breaker but for a majority of men I want
2:25:54
to know why Maybe logically it makes sense Well actually actually it should logically
2:26:00
make sense Hypocrisy people use this word the wrong way Hypocrisy doesn't
2:26:05
mean I'm guilty of the thing in which I'm telling you not to do That's not hypocrisy Hypocrisy has a um experience
2:26:13
of of pretending So let me give you an example I smoke but I tell my children not to smoke Does that make me a
2:26:19
hypocrite Should I tell my 10-year-old they can smoke Well I mean 10 years old there's a
2:26:26
lot of things you shouldn't do at 10 As a parent I do think that it's confusing for the
2:26:31
child But the pretending that's why it's not hypocrisy Pretending is what's a hypocrisy So if I
2:26:37
were to say it's wrong for anybody on planet Earth to smoke and then smoked
2:26:43
I'd be a hypocrite But if I'm like a fat person let's say I'm really fat right And I'm around another fat person say
2:26:49
"Hey you should lose some weight right?" That's not hypocrisy That person actually maybe should lose some weight
2:26:55
You actually being fat doesn't have anything to do with whether or not that person should lose weight or not It would only be if you said right I myself
2:27:04
right as a not fat person am telling you not to lose weight that would then make
2:27:09
you a hypocrite right hypocrisy has an um you have to have some type of
2:27:16
pretending associated it's not hypocrisy people confuse this with just you are
2:27:21
guilty of the same thing you're telling the other person not to do a great example of this I was a former drug
2:27:27
addict let's say okay and I'm telling people not to be drug addicts Am I a hypocrite No because you've changed your
2:27:33
ways and you're trying to I would think that as a man you're trying to lead by example right That's what a traditional
2:27:38
man But but if I was if I said "Okay I'm a former drug addict You stop being a
2:27:44
drug addict and secretly did drugs would I be a hypocrite then?" Yeah Right That's what actual hypocrisy is So if a
2:27:51
man see the definition so if a man so if a man has a preference who and he says
2:27:57
um I don't want a woman who has a high body count right but he's fine with his own high body count that's not hypocrisy
2:28:06
okay I mean to me I'm still not convinced it's still it still seems like an unfair like I mean obviously people
2:28:12
can have their well you can say it's not fair you can't say it's hypocrisy um I
2:28:18
don't know what's hypocritical about it being guilty of that which you're accusing the other person That's not hypocrisy Depending on the why on the
2:28:24
why but so when you say it's unfair right I couldn't I can't think of a better word to use That's fine Let's go
2:28:31
ahead and grant double standard maybe Yeah that might be better Let's go ahead and grant double standard Yeah I'm sorry
2:28:39
It's okay Uh let's go ahead and grant that it's unfair So
2:28:45
I I'm just trying to understand if where the logic is behind it If you guys know
2:28:51
well you guys the logic of what the logic of why it's okay for you for I'm not going to say you men typically
2:28:56
always are they are are known for sleeping around if they can get it they're going to take it cuz maybe women
2:29:02
I'm sorry well can can you clarify when you say it's okay what specifically cuz I don't think I'm making the claim that
2:29:08
it's okay for men to be promiscuous but I I am saying it's okay for a man who
2:29:15
has a high body count to want a woman who doesn't date a woman who has a low body count or who's a virgin And I'm not
2:29:21
nec I'm not disagreeing with that I just think it's the the shame and the you're disgusting and you're calling you know
2:29:27
it's revoling and yet they're sleeping around doing the same I'm actually fine with that too I'm fine with that too And
2:29:34
but are you saying it's revoling for both to be doing it like both to be promiscuous I I my viewpoint always
2:29:40
follows from Christian ethics So promiscuity in men is ju from my view right is a no no just like it is with
2:29:47
women But while that's prescriptively true meaning this is a prescription I give men and women I'm also going to
2:29:53
give a descriptive truth The descriptive truth is that it's less of a big deal for women than it is for men And because
2:30:00
that is the case that women perceive it that way versus men the societal damage is always going to be lesser if men do
2:30:05
it than if women do Sure Yeah that makes sense Simple Honestly Yeah There's my prescription My prescription is that
2:30:11
neither of you should do this But descriptively if this behavior is found in one sex versus the other it's more
2:30:16
damaging That's why we have virtues That's what femininity and masculinity is It's a tie to virtue from the sex
2:30:23
right So if women engage in one type of virtue and it does way more damage if they abandon it versus men it's feminine
2:30:30
It's masculine If men refuse the virtue it does way more damage to society That's a masculine virtue So you're saying society because men typically do
2:30:37
do it Hold on let me take this back No no The ramifications on society are it it's not
2:30:44
as bad right the outcomes are not as bad because women are generally more accepting of a high body No not just
2:30:50
that because of reproduction like the the re there's a reproductive element which goes into it which would make it
2:30:55
worse for like especially for the outcome for children if it is the case that women are promiscuous versus men
2:31:02
Like for instance you could have 300 promiscuous wh men all screwing the same
2:31:08
woman right For the for like the purpose of reproduction or whatever That's that
2:31:13
would be less bad than if you had 300 women get pregnant and be single moms right Like ultimately that would be
2:31:19
worse right Wait Worse for what Just for society in general if there was 300 single moms versus one single mom right
2:31:27
Uh that would still be worse You would agree right I don't know Are you trying to make kids I don't Yeah It's not a
2:31:33
matter of making kids I'm just trying to give you a scale That's it Just like a sliding scale I'm not saying any of it's
2:31:39
good Just which would be more optimal Which would be better sense Personally
2:31:44
my boyfriend and my ex right before him both had very low body counts I don't
2:31:52
know the exacts but I know it's pretty low And I actually appreciated that in him Okay Yeah We're not we're not even
2:31:58
saying that there's a matter of appreciation We're just saying that ultimately here's what I see that women
2:32:05
generally speaking have have a lesser interest in the male body count than the men do with the female body count Sure
2:32:12
And I also see the outcomes of if you have promiscuous women because they they can reproduce and men can't seems to
2:32:18
actually be worse if women are promiscuous than men because men can be promiscuous with a small pool of women
2:32:24
right But if women become promiscuous with a large pool of men there's going to be reproduction Is there a component
2:32:29
here too to the I guess the unfairness and the double standard is that and I I
2:32:35
agree with Andrew in so far as I don't think either men or women should be promiscuous I don't think
2:32:41
promiscuity is good in men or women but I do know that there is some cohort of
2:32:47
men who for example if a woman sleeps with a bunch of men she's a [ __ ] If a
2:32:54
guy sleeps with a bunch of women he's a stud Like it's it's And not all Trust me
2:32:59
there's men who frown on the guy who's promiscuous too like I just said right Like but I call them [ __ ] degenerates
2:33:07
but they're all degenerates I like that we've gotten here though This is great Yeah Yeah Yeah But there is uh there is
2:33:14
some men who uh will be impressed by a
2:33:20
man who's sexually successful with a lot of women Mhm So is that a component of
2:33:25
your argument Yeah that I mean that's a that's a huge part of it So I mean I'm understanding where Andrew came from
2:33:31
with the whole you know Right I mean I would again just to be clear not in favor of male promiscuity but my uh I
2:33:38
guess my response to that would be when it comes to the impressiveness factor or men who sleep with a lot of women
2:33:44
they're like "Oh that's you're you're such a stud You're so cool." Uh the reality is any single woman if she
2:33:51
wanted to could be a [ __ ] Oh yeah Any single woman could be a [ __ ] Very very
2:33:57
few men can be a [ __ ] Like most men average man he can't sleep with a new
2:34:05
girl every single day Every single girl at this table if you wanted to you could
2:34:10
sleep with a new guy every single day of the week You could probably [ __ ] three guys in a day You could probably [ __ ] 10
2:34:16
guys I see I see you shaking your head I will prove this to you I will put a bet on the table right now for 500 bucks
2:34:22
that if you and I go out to the street right now with a cardboard sign you hold it up and say "I'll sleep with any man who wants and I hold it up and say I'll
2:34:28
sleep with any woman who wants," which one of us getting picked up first Okay Which one of us getting picked up
2:34:34
first Probably me Yeah Yeah Why Why do you disagree I guess it's I mean yeah
2:34:40
women it's easier for a woman to go around go out and sleep around but for some women that's not the case and for
2:34:47
some men it's easy to go sleep around So it's like you can't even say it's easier for one gender over the other because
2:34:53
it's up two looks at the end of the day There's attractive men who can sleep around and there's attractive women who
2:34:58
can sleep around Well okay So So look just to be clear I'm not saying that there's zero men who are [ __ ] That's
2:35:05
not even my argument There's there absolutely are men who can sleep with a bunch of women I'm not this is not what
2:35:12
I'm disputing And then I think men either if they're really good-looking they can do this If they have like
2:35:17
exceptional top tier uh charisma or personality they can do it If they're
2:35:22
like well if they're super wealthy but they're a dork it's probably still going to be a little hard but like if they're
2:35:28
super rich might help And then if status like she said status celebrity so like a
2:35:36
professional athlete a musician an actor uh these men even if they're not really that good-looking or they don't have
2:35:42
great personalities whatever Uh although sometimes status tends to give the aura or the halo of of uh charisma even if
2:35:51
there's not actually any there but um but yeah so those are the those are the
2:35:56
scenarios in which men can be [ __ ] so to speak but I don't think um most men
2:36:02
fall into those categories Most men don't fall into those categories So the reality is you can take here look you
2:36:09
can take a woman who's averagel looking who's got a terrible personality no
2:36:14
personality terrible personality She has zero status She has no uh fame She has
2:36:20
no money She's not she doesn't have any of these things She could hop on Tinder
2:36:26
and sleep with three guys a day if she wanted to Most women don't want to do that but if they uh if she she could is
2:36:35
what I'm trying to get at Whereas like most men just can't do that Possibly You
2:36:41
mean physically I'm sorry What do you mean physically You mean they can't do that physically No What I'm saying is
2:36:46
they on the apps They're not the Why can't they do it Even with like uh So
2:36:52
there's there's a degree of effort too right Like a guy who's really good-looking but he stays inside all the time and doesn't communicate with women
2:37:00
but otherwise could get laid isn't going to get laid So there is a degree of effort that's involved But I would argue
2:37:05
like an averagel looking guy uh even if he's like putting in like a really good faith effort like he spends 3 hours a
2:37:11
day on dating apps he spends another hour or two messaging back and forth with different women H it's he's not
2:37:17
going to get laid every single day Whereas a woman I think you could get on a dating you could spend about an hour
2:37:23
on a dating app do some messaging you could [ __ ] three three dudes in a day And I think us women see it completely
2:37:30
for me anyway I see that completely opposite I was on like every app there was And I got a lot of play especially
2:37:37
as like a masculine presenting person But I I think it was because I was a
2:37:42
more masculine presenting person that I got so much play For for me I would
2:37:47
definitely say that if I was biologically male it would be so much easier for me to swipe right and link up
2:37:53
than it would be for because then like he said you have periods with you You should try I mean we just You should try
Percentage of guys they swipe on
2:38:00
that I have And it to you though uh have you been on dating apps at all Yes Okay
2:38:07
Uh how many guys do you swipe no on on the dating apps I don't know I haven't been on recently
2:38:13
but um quite a few Quite a few Like what percentage of men If there's 100 guys
2:38:20
how many do you say no to Probably like 6040 Oo 6040 Okay But how many of Okay
2:38:26
So how many of those guys do you meet up with Two You've only met up with two Okay Let
2:38:32
me ask you a question Uh of all the men that you've wanted to sleep with did you
2:38:37
sleep with them No Okay What's the rejection rate Um so just to be clear so
2:38:43
you offered essentially not super I'm not necessarily suggesting super directly but you offered to the guy
2:38:49
basically here's some [ __ ] You gave it to him on a silver platter and he's like "No."
2:38:57
Um that's not always been the case but it's been more or less like um I don't
2:39:02
know In my experience it's been I've been willing to but then it's just like
2:39:07
the personality is just I don't know how to explain it the guy's personality It's like wait that's making Brian's point
2:39:15
it's not good And then it just makes me like wait you you were willing to have sex in general but that specific guy
2:39:22
Well I mean I think we're all willing in general to have sex with people But yeah
2:39:27
of course So you're saying well that's just a rejection then
2:39:32
But so okay And but uh you were saying that Wait I'm just confused So okay of
2:39:39
the men that you've offered sex to were you turned down
2:39:45
One time Yeah But just to be clear I'm not saying like you had a boyfriend and one one time he was sick and he didn't
2:39:50
want to have sex that one time I'm just saying No I've been turned down before Yeah You've been rejected Okay How many
2:39:56
guys have you turned down for sex For sex I don't really have Well I have I I
2:40:03
have a way to maybe demonstrate this that everybody will agree with I call it the flasher hypothetical It works like
2:40:10
this Hang on It works like this We'll take a 25year-old random man 25-year-old
2:40:16
random woman They have an overcoat on and nothing underneath And they're flashing people in a random Walmart
2:40:23
parking lot And what they do is they open up the overcoat and they say "Hey you want to go have sex?" What the [ __ ]
2:40:28
Tell me which one man or woman is going to have sex almost immediately versus
2:40:34
the other one man or woman who I would have sex with No no no Who any who in
2:40:39
general normally would Probably a woman Okay next I'd definitely say a woman Next Oh yeah Next Next Wait I'm kind of
2:40:47
confused on the question Woman Woman Woman Okay that's the end of that then Done Women are more desirable
2:40:55
Done The point to bring it back to this though the whole thing was is like okay why is there this double standard where
2:41:02
men are kind of exalted for their promiscuity not by all people but by you
2:41:07
know uh some some group of men Uh whereas women are almost kind of universally looked down upon if there's
2:41:13
if they're promiscuous It really just comes down to the impressiveness of the achievement I think I think to some
2:41:19
degree it's incredibly easy for women to get laid whereas for men there's some
2:41:26
degree of skill and complexity uh in order to achieve that So for as a woman
2:41:34
you don't need skill to to get laid by the way as demonstrated by our hypothetical Yeah Okay As demonstrated
2:41:41
by our hypothetical Go ahead I don't know I've seen some pretty grimy not
2:41:46
that I don't even know how to explain it Just some grimy guys been able to get laid
2:41:52
easily Sure Like there's there's a guy who actually spread sds around a school
2:41:58
in my town because he was just sleeping around Well was he grimy Because there's
2:42:03
going to be lots of other men who were around him were like "How did you do that?" But if a woman's doing that
2:42:09
there's no women around who are like "How did you do that?" They all know how she did that She just offered it up and men were like "Sure." Yeah Simple So it
2:42:15
kind of comes down to like a skill thing like "Oh you didn't even have to work for it." So it's not So men are just Are
2:42:21
they angrier then Are some men angri that No No Or or just that they're like "Damn I want to be able to have sex more
2:42:29
but women get to do it easily." Let me I I guess I It wouldn't be either of those things I I pose this question to you I
2:42:36
guess going around the table of the men that you've had sex with or well of the
2:42:41
men that you wanted to have sex with and let's be reasonable here like m you probably wanted to have sex with some
2:42:47
like really attractive celebrity but he's not in your he's not in your uh orbit really I'm talking about men you
2:42:54
have like uh in person what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] is going on
2:43:00
here what the [ __ ] is going on here what is what is this what is this what
2:43:06
happened Yeah Did Well you said like celebrity and then I look over she's
2:43:12
beat red and giggling She's beat red and Okay So spill it Spill the beans I'm in
2:43:17

2:43:39

2:43:44

2:43:50
sentence That's offiscation Don't let her offiscate She got to spill the beans I We Yeah he was You were in the middle
2:43:56
of saying something here Why don't we do this Was it an athlete musician or actor Actor Actor Actor Actor
2:44:03
Uh A-list Yes Leo Nah I was actually I
2:44:09
used to be Leo's great I No not Leo and I but I' i've met Leo a couple times Leo
2:44:15
No Leo was great I met him a couple times I really liked him Please don't take this offensively Uh or don't take
2:44:21
offense to this You're probably too old for Leo I think so I think that's what No I think that's what happened I think
2:44:26
he met me and he was like he only dates like 20 under 25 or whatever So and
2:44:31
that's okay Hey I'm okay with being too old for that Uh we're going to read a couple chats but we can come back to the convo in a bit We got four It looks like
2:44:37
Lucas Yes there are double standard double standards It just is Trust me
2:44:42
there are double standards that go the other way When I turned 18 this is Lucas by the way I signed up with selective
2:44:48
I'm pretty sure selective service You didn't When the Titanic goes and he's going to continue here Thank you Lucas
2:44:55
Appreciate it To let me do this Titanic goes down You get whisked away to the

2:45:29
When the beaches of Normandy needed storming a bunch of 18-year-old
2:45:35
boys uh were sent off to do the storming while you stayed back and played Rosie
2:45:42
the Riveter Double standards are simply part and parcel of the complimentary yet
2:45:47
contrasting reproductive strategies I don't think they're complimentary Ultimately I think that um that there's
2:45:55
one's dominant and the other's not dominant I don't even think it's complimentary I won't even give it
2:46:00
complimentarian status I'm just unwilling to do that I have better arguments for why it's not
2:46:07
complimentarian Dude I know who who who it was Who Carrot top Oh my god No What
2:46:13
You definitely did Carrot Top You know what Listen No But in Yeah Would you do
2:46:18
Carro Would you do Carrot Top Who's Carro Top He's not as like He's like 18 or 19 top
2:46:25
dude I don't Is he still Is he still out and relevant or I don't know if he's done any comedy things lately He draws
2:46:31
his [ __ ] eyebrows in I mean come on Oh we have a message here from Andrew's wife This is Rachel Wilson Andrew's wife
2:46:37
The hormonal roller coaster is real Andrew is right Sometimes I just need a nap And I'm being hysterical Women need
2:46:43
to understand this so they don't blow up their lives because of mood swings Uh you've got a big face on this Do you
2:46:50
want to What do you think about the comment from Andrew's wife What do you think there Um well she can accept it
2:46:56
She That's why she is his wife Yeah Sorry Okay Uh I mean you could just like
2:47:03
kind of lie and pretend that that doesn't happen with women but it [ __ ] happens with women And if you talk to
2:47:10
every man who's been in a relationship with a woman they all have seen this time and time and time again where it's
2:47:16
like "How come my normally rational and pretty reasonable significant other has just lost her [ __ ] mind?" And by the
2:47:23
way um they actually and this is something a lot of men won't tell you a lot of men take preparation They have
2:47:30
preparations for this event They actually like a survival kit like a [ __ ] survival kit in their home like
2:47:36
a first aid kit like a like a flare kit for if you're if you're stuck on the side of the road They have a preparation
2:47:42
strategy where they're like "Here's what happens when this thing happens I'm ready for it." Bam bam bam They they
2:47:49
have it all in place You think I'm crazy There's going to be men in the chat right now who are telling you I'm telling you they're going to be like
2:47:55
"Yep yep yep." Yep Yep Yep I'm ready I'm ready I'm ready I kind of love this just
2:48:00
because it's like all we're asking for is some understanding I'm not saying I'm being rational on that one month Sometimes I'm extra sleepy It's like I'm
2:48:06
in a coma Or it could be the opposite So I'm not saying I need you to lie to me Just understand that if I'm losing my
Delusion versus reality
2:48:12
mind in this moment how do you differentiate between when a woman's being hysterical to you and when she
2:48:18
actually genuinely does need you Here's the thing that's really interesting about delusion The thing and and it is
2:48:24
it is Well hang on It is a form of delusion I'll explain If you have a rush of hormones you would not normally have
2:48:30
right it it can make you crazy You could do this with any human being on planet Earth You could perhaps take a man Yeah
2:48:37
Right And rush him with all sorts of like positive male hormones and they go [ __ ] berserko right And you know
2:48:44
possibly rip doors off handles do crazy [ __ ] like that The thing about delusion which is so interesting is that the
2:48:49
person who's diluted doesn't know they're diluted So you can't actually rationally reasonably but how do you as
2:48:55
her husband know when she's being delusional versus when she's like
2:49:00
genuinely Well just like I've been with her for years and years and years But what about someone who's in a new marriage let's say or a new relationship
2:49:06
Well it's it's not hard to detect usually for most men that like wow this person was really cool 24 hours ago and
2:49:13
now they've lost their [ __ ] mind That's really weird and they and then wait 4 days later they seem like they
2:49:20
haven't lost their [ __ ] mind anymore That's really odd But I think like as the woman who's going through something
2:49:25
that you might consider delusional and maybe she in the back of her mind does know realistically this is not something
2:49:31
to blow up about It's about having a partner who understands that they do blow up about it though Who that's the
2:49:37
problem with the delusion right It's like if you're in the delusion you don't know how bad you are No I know But eventually you cool off It's like having
2:49:44
a partner who has the empathy to like ride with you through that roller coaster of emotion Cuz what you're saying is how is that empathetic The
2:49:50
empa the empathy because something you said hormonal that you can't empathy the other direction The empathy the other
2:49:55
direction should be like look I'm literally uh jackal and hy and when I turn into [ __ ] hide I want you to be
2:50:02
empathetic It's like what the [ __ ] is that No When you turn into hide when you you become the monster right from from
2:50:09
Dr Jackal it's like the best empathy The best empathy they have fail on purpose to make it happen It doesn't matter It
2:50:16
doesn't matter why you turn into hide It doesn't matter why you turn into hide It just matters that you do Well sometimes
2:50:21
it does matter Like if your wife for example is drinking heavily and she turns into jackal because of her
2:50:27
drinking that's a choice But to have a period it's not a woman's choice to have Yeah But what would a man do in both
2:50:33
situations Same thing Be like "Well you got to stop drinking so you don't turn into hide." Right That you can't stop
2:50:38
having a period right But but here's the thing that's interesting about that right You can't stop that But it's
2:50:44
actually maximum empathy for a man to be like "Look you don't get to treat me like [ __ ] even if you can't help it."
2:50:51
That's [ __ ] [ __ ] Treat anyone like [ __ ] [ __ ] There's boundaries
2:50:57
There's levels to it But if the woman's not name calling she's not you know throwing things she's not being extremely hysterical No that's not it
2:51:03
That's not it There's a spectrum to it No no no no That's not just it It also is like you might not be making rational
2:51:09
decisions even if you're being nice to me that you normally would make you you know what I mean things like that it's
2:51:15
not just a matter of like you need to still be nice to me even when you turn into hide It's also you're not allowed
2:51:21
to make like big big financial decisions big decisions about this You're not allowed to like I don't know embarrass
2:51:27
me at a [ __ ] party or something like like you're not allowed to do any of those setting boundaries around those things I just would hope that you know
2:51:34
since you're married to a woman who can't help but have those things happen to her each month that you would have
2:51:40
some empathy for her situation that she's not choosing to turn into the jackal But don't you understand like the biggest amount of empathy is exactly the
2:51:47
idea of like I'm still going to listen to you because I know right somewhere in
2:51:52
me I know that this is not even though I can't quite detect it like most women can't they don't know when they're in it
2:51:58
that they're in it right even though they kind of do Yeah Right They kind of do They can't moment It's hard Right
2:52:05
Exactly Yeah It's hard to admit and it's even hard to like deal with Right So isn't the best thing to do from the
2:52:11
empathetic level to deal with a rational person guiding you through that to be like look you're out of control Stop And
2:52:19
you actually listen Like imagine that Yeah No I think it works both ways too Yeah Having a good partner that has your
2:52:25
back like that Moving on just a little bit here I did want to come back just for a moment before we have to do a couple chats here Uh just going around
Return to the body count standard
2:52:33
the table when I was talking about well it's uh with the double standard well it's easier for women to get laid uh
2:52:40
harder for men to get laid Do you guys agree with that I think it's easier for women to get laid for sure especially
2:52:46
with the apps Agree Yeah agree Agree Disagree Agree I'm if you disagree Um I
2:52:53
agree that I understand why it's considered a achievement for men to like
2:52:59
have more body count but it doesn't explain why like it's despised that women have more body count Like it's
2:53:06
like a different thing Uh yeah Well we kind of we kind of talked about it but
2:53:11
uh I think Andrew got into it with Did you bring up paternity certainty or they find it's a it's a matter of revulsion
2:53:19
So men find it more revoling than women right She was asking more literally find it more revolting So like I mean at at
2:53:26
its root you're asking a fine question So you're saying okay I get it that there's a higher achievement right a
2:53:32
higher achievement level That's why men would honor that over a woman who has a no achievement level because she can just open her legs and 100 men will run
2:53:38
in Right But what about the revulsion level If one sex is less revolted by an
2:53:43
activity than another sex right How do you reconcile that Like what do you do about that Perfect
2:53:49
Revolting meaning disgusting Yeah They just find it more disgusting than the other sex does You mean men find that
2:53:56
more revoling They find it more disgusting when women have a higher body count than women find it disgusting when men do Why is this so I I hear I think
2:54:04
it's I think it's rooted It's more of like a cultural thing I don't think it's I actually have something really good on
2:54:09
this Um would you agree that women will find physical weakness in men uh as less
2:54:19
attractive than if men than men finding uh physical weakness in women Does that
Physical weakness + PIZZA POP!
2:54:25
make sense No So okay when it comes asked it wrong Yeah Well okay The trait
2:54:30
of physical weakness Yeah Men are going to be very forgiving of physical weakness in women However maybe prefer
2:54:38
it Sometimes sure maybe Whereas I think physical like demonstrable physical like
2:54:44
imagine a 5B weight and the guy's like struggling to lift a 5B weight or
2:54:50
something like that I know that's an extreme example but I uh women are going to find physical weakness I think much
2:54:57
more unattractive than men Does that make it depends on the person cuz I know women who
2:55:03
love listen there's no example you could ever give about anything on planet earth where we couldn't say it depends on the
2:55:09
person We could talk about We could talk about murder We could talk about theft We could talk about the most We could
2:55:14
talk about incest It depends on the person Doesn't actually help us with this Right If we're looking at it from a
2:55:21
social scale we would have to look at it at the social scale of how these sexes generally seem to respond to this Is it
2:55:27
the case that generally speaking at least in all of your experiences you would definitely prefer to have a man
2:55:33
who is at least stronger than you I mean that that depends We're in 2025
2:55:38
so you're not building me a house You're not building me a hut You're not fighting off saber-tooth tigers But you
2:55:44
are But all of but all of those same reasons like the building the hut and the fighting off the saber-tooth tiger
2:55:49
and this and that would be rudimentary why it was that women were attracted to that to begin with It's built
2:55:55
biologically Well kind of back then you still believe you still tribes where there was women that were the warriors
2:56:00
too So I know you can do that this that this that Not really But but even
2:56:05
then so even with tribes out of the warriors that that were women but that's yeah and weakness and all of these
2:56:12
things There really wasn't that many tribes where there was women I didn't say there was that many I just said that there was don't think so It's dubious
2:56:19
It's very the ants belong to uh jungle jungle jungle back again
2:56:25
$1,000 No pineapple Andrew needs some pizza So is
2:56:32
this a pizza pop Wait jungle Is this a pizza pop instead of a champagne pop It's a pizza pop It's a pizza pop Pizza
2:56:39
pop The girls want to eat too Why are the guys I'll order I'll order pizza for the table We'll do We'll do a little
2:56:45
pizza Am I the only one that likes pineapple and pizza I mean and she don't even say that around Oh yeah No
2:56:52
pineapple He will just lose his mind The Asian Pacific Island My wife My wife loves it too But that's how I know that
2:56:59
you know Satan is involved somewhere But um so there's there's a little bit
2:57:04
of Satan in there somewhere somewhere Does that make sense at all or no Like
2:57:10
so you're talking about bi biology like if she's a virgin you're sure that's your kid You're talking about Well yeah
2:57:16
In that case but he gave the different example if it is the case that women are generally attracted to men who are
2:57:23
strong Yeah So this is like biology or like evolution right Like if we we're
2:57:29
talking about evolution Well in this case we're just talking about even if you didn't know anything about evolution you knew nothing about it Let's just
2:57:35
pretend you knew nothing It didn't even exist You would still at least observe that men or women were attracted to men
2:57:41
who were strong Yeah Yeah So you can at least observe that You don't even need an evolutionary explanation You can at
2:57:48
least observe it And that men generally aren't attracted to women who are stronger than them Right So you mean
2:57:54
it's natural Well just observable you would at least observe that that is the
2:58:00
case right Mhm So but like you give this example Yeah I need you to answer the question I see that you're kind of like
2:58:08
not answering the question Is that observable or not Observable that uh
2:58:14
women prefer strong woman men Yeah Yeah Okay So you can observe that that is the
2:58:19
case Mhm Okay Got it And then you can observe the counter that uh men don't
2:58:25
seem to prefer particularly strong women It's not a preference they have So when they're looking for women they're not
2:58:31
like "Oh the fact that she can really lift up heavy [ __ ] is a big deal for them right You can observe that right?"
2:58:38
Yeah Okay great So what Brian's point was is like if that's the case we're
2:58:43
talking about the distinction observation in the interexual dynamic
2:58:49
and in the interpersonal dynamic What were you moving it into the from the
2:58:54
attraction portion Uh it already it's already slips my mind Are you serious
2:59:00
Yeah I just went through that whole [ __ ] thing He's on pizza
2:59:06
Well no we were when it came to the disgust thing right Oh yeah The disgust thing It would be the same thing It
2:59:12
would just be like if it is the idea that if re if like really masculine
2:59:17
women meaning they were stronger than the men disgusted men or really weak men disgusted women Um is is that like a
2:59:25
double standard I I maybe have something Um are there anything when it comes to
2:59:31
uh for a guy you're thinking about dating are there any behaviors or traits that you might find disgusting
2:59:41
Being not clean Okay Well I think that could go both ways but that's fair Certainly Uh but are there anything
2:59:48
maybe specifically related to uh this guy jungle Okay hold on This
2:59:55
guy pizza bro And he's getting me a burrito
3:00:01
Pop champagne This guy's a giga chat dude Holy [ __ ] You can get out Thank you

3:01:01
thinking about pizza and burrito Uh like how about this maybe Like would you date uh are you typically attracted to men
3:01:08
who are like shorter than you No No Okay So that would be a bit of an example
3:01:13
It's kind of related to the ick You guys all get the ick when it comes to guys stuff Uh you explained the paternity
3:01:19
uncertainty right Yeah Um okay Last thing Well I mean it just comes down to ick It comes down to the It just comes
3:01:25
down to preference and ick Yeah I don't know why that Christopher thing for the 20 gifted members Comes down to the get
3:01:31

Asking for s3x and chats
3:02:15
Gabrielle after the show tonight would you like to have sex with me No Uh I'm
3:02:22
sorry I forgot your name It's okay Nameless woman I forgot your This is the best way to proposition a woman for sex

3:02:34
Would you like to have sex after the show tonight I'm good Thank you Okay Uh would you you've been celibate for like 3 years or something Would you like to
3:02:40
have sex after the show tonight No Oh see you've just been offered sex on a silver platter You turn it down
3:02:48
Hold on More to it We're also on a public forum What if one of wants to but
3:02:54
doesn't want everybody to have Wait a second So you guys are liable advocate cuz I've been in
3:02:59
situations So you guys are So you guys are lying and you do want to have sex with Brian Maybe I don't want a thousand
3:03:05
I knew it I knew it I still have but even if that's even wouldn't that make
3:03:10
his point that like if any of you said yes he looks like a [ __ ] king right
3:03:15
but if after if after the fact you're like actually Brian you know what I actually do kind of want to like you
3:03:22
know do this thing with you right after the fact isn't it because you feel like you're devalued if right now you said
3:03:28
yes well no what if you're just a private person yeah a private person why like if you
3:03:35
were going to get some a steam boost from that or like some crowns for that wouldn't she be like "Yeah sure." Yeah
3:03:41
Not if we knew that the as a heterosexual which I'm not Like for these ladies sitting here if they said
3:03:48
yes to that question to one of you guys you should maybe they and maybe they
3:03:53
want to you know but then when they leave here the other guys who may think like y'all will then devalue them
3:04:00
because they're But that's the whole point Yeah I think like you literally hit the nail on the head right So the whole point would be he gets the crowns
3:04:06
if they say yes they get the shame if they say yes So like what if after the
3:04:12
show we could make some like little arrangement or something like this right In this case you don't get the shame
3:04:17
portion right Isn't that the point And whoever does have sex with me after the show that's your last body Like we're getting married So you don't have that
3:04:25
kind of someone who doesn't really believe in marriage Am I wrong I'm just Well first of all taking one for the

a rhetorical question I was trying to demonstrate an argument Yes Yeah Yeah To
3:05:57
make a point Yeah Cuz like next time you should make it more extreme You should be like "Hey will you give me a [ __ ]
3:06:03
after the show?" You should just like take it one step like to the next You know what I mean Just to make it more than sex Oh just like she won't have sex
3:06:11

3:09:09
slate social constructionist theory Men have been since time inmemorial and will
3:09:15
continue to be viscerally and sub subconsciously revolted by promiscuity in women This has been settled science
3:09:23
for decades And it was also settled even before the scientific method was even
3:09:29
introduced as a method Right This was something which was a matter of law prescribed by almost all societies
3:09:35
globally be because he's exactly right It is a social constructionist theory
3:09:40
This idea that this doesn't exist blank slate theory that we have no preferences that are ingrained in us for the purposes of re of being revolted He's
3:09:47
totally right Yeah No a lot of us have said it is primal Like that's the thing It's just I think some of us were asking
3:09:53
why We were trying to get deeper on why Like when she was ever asked someone why is it revoling Why is it we keep going
3:09:59
back Because it is Oh she's a ho That's the default I feel like I gave you
3:10:04
actually No no you I'm understanding I'm just saying that that's why And by the way Lucas Lucas is totally right You
3:10:10
already know We already agreed Lucas is mostly by the way totally right Except for me I'm totally right more than you
3:10:16
Lucas But other than me Lucas you're the most right Uh Lucas has some continuations Jungle I'll get to it once
3:10:23
I get through all of Lucas's continuations Jungle's Who is Who is this guy Jungle Jungle Where's Jungle
3:10:30
What does the F stand for Brian What Fever He's trying You know The Crucible likes to support the channels that
3:10:36
support The Crucible Brian I'm grateful I'm just When I say "Who is
3:10:42
this guy?" I'm like "This guy's a [ __ ] legend." He is a [ __ ] legend He's a [ __ ] Here let me play this thing for him He's a He's a brave and a decent
3:10:48
man Oh my god He's a brave and a What does the F stand for Fever Jungle fever
3:10:54
Jungle fever It has to be jungle What if it's jungle [ __ ] you
3:11:01
What if it's jungle fallopian tube Wow Oh there it is Yep I mean just I think I
3:11:06
could be I think you're right It's possible Lucas too This isn't the hill
3:11:11
hill to die on You're not changing fully entrenched preference Likewise don't
3:11:17
hearken to evolution as to why this primordial aversion to pro promiscuity
3:11:22
should no longer apply since we are now enlightened beyond our primitive impulses Continued three Oh it's an
3:11:31
incontrovertible fact that almost all animals including humans have not changed i.e evolved in the last 200s
3:11:40
thousand years behind a dimminimus Oh my god this guy is on fire Lucas you're on
3:11:46
fire with the words The thesaurus has been brought out Minimal local adaptation
3:11:52
He's He's googling Oh my god Deminimus That's a legal term by the way Well done Lucas He's an attorney A very powerful
3:11:59
attorney Chad if you need if you need an attorney if you need an attorney in New
3:12:04
York City he's your guy Okay Minimal local adaptation
3:12:09
Why are we doing the voice I kind of like it Yeah In evolution
3:12:14
literally takes millions of years Chair three As a male dating coach I recommend
3:12:20
against trying to convince men at least conservative men they should look past
3:12:25
body count Otherwise you're looking at an incredibly short feray As a men's
3:12:31
dating coach of course if you're advising simp liberal soy boys then
3:12:36
disregard and godspeed to you Well he makes two really good points Let me respond to both of them real quick The the first great point he makes is right
3:12:43
at the end of it Actually progressives utilize feminism and utilize female
3:12:49
promiscuity as a mating strategy They actually do They are the ones you'll see at the forefront promoting OAF and
3:12:55
promoting all of the female promiscuity they possibly can Which men are you saying Progressive liberal men
3:13:00
progressive liberal as a as a you know instead of like conservative traditional men progressive men tend to do this
3:13:06
because it's a much better mating strategy for them because they're [ __ ] Literally it's because they're [ __ ] So God there's some men that
3:13:13
actually really love a woman with a high sexy challenge any day of the week Progressive I don't I mean sure with
3:13:18
that one Yeah But I've definitely noticed that Yeah They're they're they're [ __ ] I just think if it's your preference it's your preference But
3:13:25
the other point that he says is like he's right So the modern incarnation of humanity is only what uh 200 to 400,000
3:13:33
years old from an evolutionary standpoint That's like meaningless That's like a drop in the bucket Evolution takes millions of years for
3:13:40
even gradual changes So we even if it were the case that this is the incarnation of humanity that's 400,000
3:13:46
years old We have not gotten past this idea of like we're revolted by this for
3:13:52
reason But I it's interesting because a lot of us have already agreed that we already all came to it that were like "Oh yeah we know men have this revoling
3:13:59
thing against women with high body counts." Yeah got it Move on The next topic was why And then we're like "Why
3:14:04
Why are we there was a lot of different questions." We pushed it because we're trying to get a full-fledged Yeah We
3:14:10
wanted to know understanding at least that's where now the only thing that I do is I've said that there's there are
3:14:15
people that like I mean women too Women can have a revoling thing against that too You can absolutely have women that
3:14:21
are like I am revolted against a high body count men or women We're just we're just looking at the the the idea of like
3:14:27
I would never dispute that I've known women who are like absolutely not Like playboys things like that discuss them
3:14:33
visibly But generally speaking if you're talking to a woman and you ask her the question
3:14:39
I asked her would you accept a man who has like a 100 body count if he fits all the other criteria She said "Yeah." But
3:14:45
you ask a man but you ask the man the same question Right Would you accept a woman who meets all the criteria but she
3:14:51
has like a 100 body count They say no Is it really important to ask That's another question I have What if I just
3:14:57
don't want to know I don't think it used to be as important but I think it sure is important now because because of
3:15:03
trends You think that the answer is really going to change that much depending on if the man's more
3:15:09
conservative or more liberal Yes Okay So I think that that kind of shows that
3:15:15
different men have different 100% I've had men who are sitting right across from me who
3:15:21
literally say "I prefer that my woman is certified pre-fucked." Okay They've said it out loud No I've heard that Okay Yeah
3:15:28
They They've said it out loud And the reason is is because they're like "You you think I'm an ally right You like me
3:15:33
now right I'm an ally for women's rights right?" And it's all a strategy to try Those men are getting more women these
3:15:40
days sometimes than some of the traditional guys Shoot If that's their
3:15:45
tactic and that's what they want to do more power to them Let them live their best lives They're going under the cover sometimes Like you're not outright
3:15:51
saying I'm a Trump supporter The men the men who showed up to like the women's march and wore [ __ ] hats on their head
3:15:57
Let me tell you something Those are not guys who are getting a lot of [ __ ] I'm just going to say they're not the guys I
3:16:03
think it depends on their looks Yeah I mean sure But remember women don't care The guy who has good looks is the kind
3:16:09
of guy he's going to show up and wear a [ __ ] on his head If the girl he's really into wants him too Maybe No no no

to admit that for the perfect woman I would bow and I'm going to have to have this debate with Andrew Here are the notes It's going to be here's here's how
3:37:04
it's going to go too It's going to be hypothetical hypothetical hypothetical Andrew wins Watch
3:37:11
I think he's going to make some really good points though He's got to find it I'm excited for the points Cope Brian Cope Cope I got it bro Little little cop
3:37:18
I got it Hold on C [Music] Uh so Oh before we get into it before we
3:37:25
do I need to pose her a question I need to pose her one thing on the bow thing So okay So your perfect guy What What
3:37:31
That's fair That's fair Your perfect guy right So this is uh this would be the
3:37:37
perfect guy in terms of what you would find most physically attractive Perfect guy in terms of what you would find in
3:37:44
terms of personality And then if you want you could add on like he's a trillionaire So he's the richest man in
3:37:50
the world That's when I'm saying perfect That's what I'm willing to grant for the
3:37:55
hypothetical Would you bow for that man If you just saw what just happened you would have lost your [ __ ] mind
3:38:02
Is it on It's not a big deal I'm just I'm just talking smack It's not a big deal No big deal Is it like a flash No
3:38:10
No No Nothing like that Oh Well that I walked by the camera Yeah No no no Had nothing even to do with you
3:38:17
Like to No No Nothing like that Yeah Oh Anyway go ahead Sorry Now I want to know
3:38:24
what the [ __ ] Yeah Right Okay So so you're all like OCD out all the time and so if the cameras aren't
3:38:31
like where they follow the camera No she walked in front of it and we saw the back of her head for like a good 5
3:38:36
seconds before it's Oh yeah Right Whatever Whatever I don't care Whatever It's not a big deal All right
She REFUSES to bow!
3:38:43
Uh okay Uh answer
3:38:49
Three times a week Yeah Yeah Now she's negotiating it He's saving children in
3:38:55
world hunger He's Well I'm going to up it but would you for Yeah Three times a week would you do the bow Okay Okay
3:39:02
Seven uh every single day No I don't understand the differential
3:39:08
though of like yes three three days a week but no not to seven days a week Like what's the what's the uh
3:39:16
reasoning there [Music] Let me ask you a question You're working
3:39:22
on your PhD right Once you get your PhD do you want to become a professor You want to I assume you want to get a good
3:39:29
paying job I want to become a professor A professor How much do professors make
3:39:34
Oh I don't know I'll work in China but not very much Okay Uh if somebody came
3:39:40
along uh some like really weird autistic guy came along and said
3:39:48
he came along and he was like I'm going to pay you a million dollars a year and all you have to do is uh you have to
3:39:56
work at my restaurant for 10 minutes a day and all you have to do is just bow
3:40:02
to the guests who are coming into the restaurant only for 10 minutes a day and he'll pay you a million dollars a year
3:40:07
and that's it Would you do it I would do it Interesting Okay So that's a million
3:40:14
dollars a year But you wouldn't you wouldn't do it for your perfect man
3:40:20
who's a trillionaire who conceivably your shared wealth would far exceed making a million dollars a year I think
3:40:26
it's a different thing because that would be a job But now we are talking about my partner like why does he want
3:40:32
me to do that I think there's some like like power like difference here
3:40:38
Let's even grant for sure it is Let's even grant that it is a power thing and he just gets off He gets off to it Same
3:40:46
thing as the employer though The employer employ
3:40:51
if he has you come in for 10 minutes a day to bow and gives you a million dollars It's not about power
3:40:57
Well is it it's got to be about power right But you would still do it even if it was about power the employer just
3:41:03
wanted to see you bow What if in every other aspect he's treating you with respect It's everything that your
3:41:08
perfect man your your relationship is about All he's asking is for a moment of submission to be like I love you
3:41:15
Everything you're giving me like I appreciate everything you've given me Yeah It's almost like a thank you more than just like a I'm your I don't know
3:41:22
Subservient Yeah Yeah It's not really in that way I think sometimes people hear submissive and they think very negative
3:41:28
Would you It's really hard to imagine that like he she's not into it Seems
3:41:33
like so if she's not the right match then if she's not into it too It's just
3:41:39
interesting because she's willing to do it for pay but not for the perfect partner of her dreams who where she could probably life in a certain time I
3:41:45
kind of get some of that with it being like your partner cuz that's the person you share every meal with You spend every night usually sleeping in bed with
3:41:52
So to know that that power dynamic is like off for her for the rest of her life in that relationship whereas a job
3:41:58
she could come in a couple shifts get a couple mill and dip But look at but look at you what you're pursuing um mast's
3:42:06
doctors which one phd a PhD a woman pursuing a PhD or with a PhD is probably
3:42:12
not bowing to anyone So I think it goes right back to the I think women with PhD would bow for million dollar We got one
3:42:19
right here who has her notes turned up and I would she said she would she's willing to do it as a job but she's not
3:42:24
willing to do it for the partner of her rest of her life Right So this one I have a a bit of an internal conflict
3:42:32
with Do I think that there's men out there who are very prideful and would be very dominant in a
3:42:39
relationship but would still go to like a Caesar's palace and bow for 10 minutes for a million dollars a year I think
3:42:44
they would think so I don't think that that's even problematic or contradictory The whole point here is the the matter
3:42:52
of like love and respect The idea is is that your partner if they feel like it's showing them love and respect for you
3:42:59
for you to take the submissive position they want to see that in a bow Is that appropriate That's really what the heart
3:43:04
of the question is Not whether or not you go to a Caesar's palace and bow for a [ __ ] million dollars cuz almost anybody would right Yeah That's simple
3:43:11
That's Yeah 10 minutes If it would benefit my entire family to go to a Caesar's palace and bow for 10 [ __ ]
3:43:17
minutes in order to get a million bucks yeah I [ __ ] take the million bucks and laugh on my way out But in regards to what we're comparing here where it's
3:43:24
her job for part-time work of a million dollars a shift and then the rest of her
3:43:30
life is being spent with somebody it's like you going to Caesar's palace and they're saying "You have to give up your wife and your children Here's a million
3:43:36
dollars but now you're with me." Yeah Yeah But that's a completely different type of hypothetical that really doesn't
3:43:42
dive in I don't think that I don't think the hypothetical gets to the heart of what we're trying to get to No that's
3:43:47
her argument is that she would be willing to do it for work for the 10 minutes of bowing at a restaurant Which
Brainstorming a champagne pop
3:43:52
is exactly why I think the hypothetical doesn't get to what we're trying to get to Yeah I would just concede that I
3:43:57
think that most men if I went to basically any man on planet Earth and was like "Hey show up for 10 minutes and
3:44:02
bow to people and I'll give you a million bucks." He doesn't give a [ __ ] He's like "Whatever I'll take the million bucks and laugh all all the way
3:44:08
to the bank Right That doesn't really get to the heart of what we're after here The heart of what we're after is is
3:44:14
that if a man wants that type of submission from his woman right Just wants it Yeah For some reason he feels
3:44:21
like this is the ultimate way in which he receives respect and you really adore him and love him Would you do it Yeah
3:44:27
I've also dated men [Music] Jungle donated
3:44:33
$1,000 Pop champagne Don't want a date don't need a date My woman is stacked
3:44:40
with gracious femininity The both of me is if I want she gives because she
3:44:45
trusts me I don't ask for it BTW I'm leaving the f mystery There we go Jungle
3:44:52
man There we go Um I've dated guys that were like that that like they they loved
3:44:57
that kind of dynamic but they also appreciated that I you know stronger in other areas right It wasn't it wasn't
3:45:04
like I'm always subservient I'm always like submissive It was like they love that I was strong and had a career and
3:45:09
and they empowered me in it and it was this really cool power dynamic A different example that you could give her that wasn't specifically a bow I'm
3:45:16
wondering if it's the bow that makes it seem like it's a Well I think I think the bow is the bow is fine Champagne
3:45:23
I'll take champagne I think that I think that the bow is a a fine fine example Pass the bottle down The idea here is
3:45:29
like women get on their knees and suck men's dicks It's like don't don't give me a bunch of [ __ ] about how bowing is
3:45:35
too [ __ ] it's it's a little too much to bow It's like no it's not give me a
3:45:40
break for for every day to the same person maybe though like you know that's made by Brian by the
3:45:47
way if the guy if the guy's argument this is how I frame the argument it's
3:45:52
like okay you won't bow to a guy but on the first date you'll have sex with him
3:45:59
you'll give him head you'll let him blast on your face I like that though Brian that women
3:46:06
feel like they're getting something out of that whereas The bowing they might think is just like a we it's just weird
3:46:11
for I think she just may be an exception to the rule There's always going to be exceptions She may be the one of you
3:46:18
know I'm not going We found the diamond in the rough I think that's what it is I think I feel like the major other than
3:46:24
because you you're a little more masculine presenting I think the majority of us are like yeah we're going to do that I think the more feminine
3:46:31
women the [ __ ] it went all the way over there What the [ __ ] What the [ __ ] It's
3:46:36
here That's yours No that's yours No way No that's yours No it's not I've been drinking from the bottles Did you want
3:46:43
any more No I'm okay I've been drinking from the bottles Do you want more Yeah Fill up more for you Fill up more for
3:46:48

3:46:55
[ __ ] around Uh Jungle you're a legend sir Thank you sir Thank you Thank you Jungle Oh my
3:47:01
This guy is on fire I still have some of the original bottles so we'll do a cheers Uh uh cheers to um bowing I
3:47:13
Yeah I haven't I haven't By the way Brian Brian I just want to let you know two times two times now you're like
3:47:20
Andrew is running away from the bow debate And uh just I just wanted to kind of bring it back real quick
3:47:27
Just saying I'm out boys I'm out boys By the way the pizza and the burrito and the ice cream is coming It's on the way
3:47:33
boys And not not for you You get nothing The rules
3:47:39
Oh I've done that I did one time Okay this one time You
3:47:44
guys can find this It's some lore right I I don't I don't know if the frame was on me Maybe they move the frame off
3:47:51
Maybe Brian can put it behind the scenes But one time there was like an almost full champagne bottle and I was like
3:47:57
"Fuck nobody's drinking anything." So I I had to make some content So I tried to toss it back and the whole thing flared
3:48:02
up and it just went all over me It was terrible And there's something about champagne that bubbles more Andrew
3:48:08
Pasty's asking what he wants to do a specific kind of pop

outside perspective That was a misunderstanding Wait here Let me play his last message though Okay play it
3:56:24
Hold on You're telling me this isn't flirting Hang on Let me listen to it Pop champagne Chair five You are dreaming of
3:56:32
me So technically I'm the man of your present dreams Congratulations You won When you bow
3:56:39
after kneeling dreams come true How does that equate to he wants a date Brian
3:56:45
I don't know That's not even in the same universe He's making he's literally contrasting a hypothetical He's like "So
Discerning the superchats
3:56:52
since it is the case that you're dreaming of me all the time just remember I'll always be here when you bow in your dreams to a man like me."
3:56:59
How does that equate to like he wants a date dude Oh [ __ ] Hold on Wait It's offiscation It's [ __ ] offiscation bro
3:57:07
What's going on What What the [ __ ] What the [ __ ] Pizza They put pineapples No I

just I need to order the [ __ ] [ __ ] odd dog dude Show Hold on Hold on What kind of office gate What the [ __ ] kind
3:57:20
of I still think it was a misunderstanding So I will Yeah How was that a misunderstanding Because he said
3:57:26
"You're dreaming of me." Now I know he probably meant a man like me but it sound like "Oh me." No he did mean him
3:57:33
Here's a thousand No he actually meant him And then he says "I'm in your dreams." That doesn't equate to like "I
3:57:39
want you." That equates to like you want me If I say I'm in your dreams how does
3:57:44
that equate to I want you But wait is that still okay for you to say if you have like would your wife be okay if if
3:57:50
you said something to that effect Yeah If I said "Oh look this chick I'm I literally dominate her mind in her
3:57:55
dreams My wife how would why would she be upset by that?" Specifically you could you could because that would be
3:58:01
who ex person would be dreaming of I get it I still think there's a could
3:58:06
be easily misunderstood That's all No [ __ ] wet I could see where Brian was trying to give him a shot

Uh Damber I don't see it Where did you DM Tell me where you DM' jungle All right Um I have a quick question for you
4:02:17
Brian With your big Leia matter Is that like a deal breaker for you I'm just
4:02:23
curious I'm just generally curious Like you know how people have their deal breakers and you're advocating for it
4:02:28
What if you met your perfect woman but she doesn't have big labia I don't even know what big labia would what the size
4:02:34
is Are you measuring Are you like an innie or an Audi Is that what you're I'm not going to discuss mine I'm just
4:02:40
curious if that's a deal breaker for you If she doesn't if she doesn't have what you consider big labia but in every
4:02:47
other aspect that's it's not it's not a dealbreaker It's not a deal breaker I was just curious Yeah Yeah Because I see
4:02:52
a lot of these men buying your BLM hoodies So Oh speaking of which curious
4:02:58
Speaking of which guys uh shop.whatever.com We've got big
4:03:03
labia big labia matter uh hoodies t-shirts if you want to get
4:03:09
one Shop and we'll give you a shout out Uh as if you send one in Streamlabs can
4:03:14
show merch purchases Yeah It's not deal breaker Uh but it is a preference
4:03:20
Preferences are allowed That's right I mean women have genital preference You guys want a guy who's cut You guys want
4:03:26
a guy with a big dick Yeah No no there's nothing wrong with preference I was just curious cuz some people are very like I
4:03:31
know some women who are like "Oh you can't be under a certain." Which to me is crazy but everybody has their
4:03:37
preference Uh yes Pasty I we could probably do this assuming it's available
4:03:42
But yeah we could probably we could probably do that But if it's like some super unique alcohol but I think Andrew
4:03:48
would really like this So uh yeah we'll we'll go and buy it if you do the pop But I got to wait until he's back He's
4:03:54
out on the balcony smoking a sig So but yeah we'll do it Pasty I'm going to I'm going hold you to that though Pasty
4:04:00
Pasty needs to put his money where his mouth is He's been doing 10 for What the Wait I'm gonna pull that up for Yeah
4:04:08
Yeah I'll tell I'll tell them Thank you Acon Or wait what Okay Uh where are we here Let me get to through some of the
4:04:15
show notes while we're just waiting Uh let's see here Uh we got everybody's
4:04:21
gone from the table Uh oh Natalie are you going to do some hypnotherapy for us or what No Okay Is
4:04:30
hypnotherapy somewhat comparable to like placebo effect where it's like okay maybe if they think they're making
4:04:36
something happen So uh yeah actually So some of it is that too Um like
4:04:41
affirmations have been shown and proven that like if you force yourself to believe something or say it over and over and over again you'll actually
4:04:48
behave that way and can break through any limits or fears that you have Um Tony Robbins is really good about that
4:04:53
So Tony Robbins has this thing where like he'll do this trick and technique where whenever you're feeling down and
4:04:59
out you just get up start moving around move that energy move that whatever And then what he does is he'll like scream
4:05:05
affirmations until he forces himself to believe it So you can dulu your way into
4:05:10
an amazing life for sure So yeah that's kind of whatever you believe If you can force yourself to believe that you're
4:05:16
worthy and you're good enough then you can definitely break limits make more money Who the hell being over I ate a
4:05:24

4:09:10
So let's talk about hypnotherapy Oh god Okay let's do it Why do you do hypnotherapy You know it's [ __ ] It
4:09:16
is Some of it So I don't But I don't do it that much I do a little bit A little
4:09:22
Yes Is it Yes Yes There's glue in No Uh I can do You can't do that It's okay Uh
4:09:28
one two three four five That's more pizza for me Yeah He can have mine I would eat the meat off of it
4:09:37
Just you just you just do the toppings Yeah I'll just scoop that off It's very keto You just like wait until all of the
4:09:44
like everybody grabs their piece You know how at the bottom of the pizza there's always like a topping at the
4:09:49
It's my favorite Yeah I always go over to the pizza box It's like treats for fat kids where you just like grab them
4:09:54
and you just you know Okay to answer your question honestly like I've done some of it and I
4:10:00
understand like affirmations So I understand that if I if someone else comes in and gives me better thoughts
4:10:06
than what I'm telling myself like I grew up with a voice in my head that said some nasty things and mean things a
4:10:13
voice in your head Do you not do you don't have like a voice that tells you things like an idea of ideas Well okay I
4:10:18
have an internal dialogue Internal dialogue That's my voice That's what I mean So there was my internal dialogue
4:10:24
that didn't say very nice things So there was hypno there was like hypnotherapy or people who would give me
4:10:30
better affirmations or better things for me to say in my head my internal dialogue So that but honestly um with a
4:10:37
lot of it is getting the hypnotherapy um uh certification and I I'm just going to
4:10:43
say it Um getting the hypnotherapy certification was easy and all and really honestly I love NLP I do NLP I do
4:10:50
love that Um what's NLP Neural linguistic programming Tony Robbins does a lot of it You do it essentially too
4:10:56
You have like you know patterns You spot patterns People reveal everything So you do a form of it for sure like you listen
Her hypnotherapy training + Andrew's thoughts on advice
4:11:03
you hear you figure it out Um that I really like that certification But when I when I went off on my own I started my
4:11:09
own company and I started my own business I just I liked the She can't do gluten Okay Oh yeah Does everyone have
4:11:16
She got one You got one I'm trying to like direct I'm so sorry No you're good Food's important And then one more for
4:11:22
her I'll take this one Yeah that's great Thank you There we go There we go I just
4:11:27
liked all the the the little fancy not fancy but the the things they'd be like I've got this and
4:11:33
I've got this and I've got this I'm a certified hypnotherapist I'm a certified this Exactly Yeah There's some little
4:11:39
things that'll do but Yeah Exactly And I and I'm being honest with it I did the certifications and all that because I wanted to be like "Look I know what the
4:11:46
heck I'm doing I'm going to help you I'm going to pull your head out of you." Is that kind of like guru [ __ ] though I hate guru [ __ ] But yeah that is guru But
4:11:53
don't we all have it No Don't you with with um with a debate I specifically
4:11:58
make sure like that I don't give advice So I always tell my audience I'm not your guru I'm not to give advice I'm an
4:12:05
entertainer Yeah Yeah You Yeah And it's you're really good at it Um I try I mean
4:12:12
there's advice that I'll give but mostly it's like you are trying to get the person to figure out what it is that they want and go after it So but I mean
4:12:18
I'm sure if someone came up to you and actually asked for advice you'd be able to give it I don't Here's why So from my
4:12:24
from my perspective yeah you don't want to [ __ ] up their life Exactly Well it's
4:12:30
not just it's not just they don't want to [ __ ] up their life but I think that unless you intricately know a person's
4:12:35
situation from the inside out and it takes a long time to do that Yes To really get to know a person
4:12:42
that any advice you give them is likely going to be bad unless it's basic So
4:12:47
here's what I mean by that right Like don't stick your face in that fryer That's pretty basic advice I think
4:12:53
anybody can give and it would probably be pretty good Right Right The type of woman you want is X Way different Yes
4:13:01
Right But I won't do that I'll have them write that out and then I can at least tell them why they're not maybe getting
4:13:07
that But usually with with with decision making no they you they can write it out
4:13:13
You can figure out how to go after what you want I'm just there as like also someone to take accountability or help
4:13:20
you with accountability too to get it Yeah But like uh I think there'd be a better way of saying it Accountability
4:13:25
Yeah I I get that But the hypnotherapy thing do you actually engage in that No not really There's only What does that
4:13:32
mean though See that caveat You're like not really Because I guess so there's this that would be I guess considered
4:13:39
under the umbrella Uh let's say someone has um a really big insecurity and they
4:13:45
feel like they're not good enough Um and so they're not going after the woman that they really want or they're not going after their You give affirmations
4:13:52
Oh you Yeah there's affirmations So yeah exactly Where you can just kind of overcome that So that'd be under to go
4:13:57
to church if they want to Yeah And but like um I have clients that you can I
4:14:04
could tell like they're spiritual and they want that and I would say like try different things or like what are your
4:14:09
hobbies What are the things that really light you up And they'll reveal it They'll be the ones that say I used to do this I'm kind of feeling like I'm
4:14:15
disconnected So I get to tell them that like look if that's what you're really wanting what are you what are you doing
4:14:20
What's stopping you What's Why aren't you going So then you try to give them like a gentle push if they kind of reveal that Cuz I feel like most people
4:14:27
with church are don't want it until they actually open up to
4:14:33
Yeah What is that
4:14:39
It's amazing Round of applause ladies Yeah
4:14:45
[Applause] This is for jungle burrito
4:14:52

4:26:49
first date Yeah No it's never Never I have a quick question Andrew This goes
4:26:54
way back into earlier in the podcast when you had mentioned that men do actually better interpersonally and they
4:27:00
have really close relationships with other men and things like that So why is it when it comes to women in a relationship they automatically go "Nope
4:27:07
let me find somebody else." But with other men you said questionably even with close friendships it could be a
4:27:14
little bit harder to keep those like they have to work a little bit harder for those relationships I'm sorry I'm I'm trying to make sure I unless I
4:27:21
misunderstand I understand what you're saying Um you Okay Wait So Oh if if
4:27:26
you're fine with this Andrew Yeah Can you hold that question for later on in the show just so we can move things

4:33:04
One time I'm on a plane on cocaine and
4:33:10
that that I don't know I don't know Lit Anyway Okay whatever Were you aware during the day that this was happening
4:33:15
or was it later that you were like "Wait a second." Yeah it was kind of uh all of a sudden I'm realizing that like he's
4:33:21
talking a lot and his eyes are bulging Um and I just was going with the flow I was like "Sure." Um I was early 20s okay
4:33:29
You know I wanted to impress him and say yes to whatever And we wound up at a sex shop and and and I don't have anything
4:33:36
wrong with that I think it's great on a first date not knowing the person and watching them high on cocaine was crazy What No you're going to responding to
4:33:43
that That's Casey's either trolling or Yo Christopher Murphy thank for the gifted
4:33:49
20 memberships You are a legend Christopher Murphy Oh my goodness
4:33:54
Oh my goodness They are on fire tonight in the chat Let me play that Okay And
4:33:59
then you were on a different date with a guy You really liked him He drove you up the coast to his favorite restaurant at
4:34:06
sunset because you said you loved seafood It was simple thoughtful
4:34:11
effective Uh yes What sound does he Yeah Is it going
4:34:17
to be It's going to be like aw man That sounds like a lot of work
4:34:27
Oh [ __ ] All these rules I don't know That sounds like a lot Uh
4:34:33
that sounds a lot If unless that he likes it too Like if he was just doing it going out of his own way but I mean
4:34:39
he liked su seafood too and it was his favorite spot It was like something that he was already going to in Malibu you
4:34:45
know So it was like a tag along kind of Yeah There you go I personally think the best first date Yes
4:34:52
is to have the girl come over and do your laundry Absolutely Just ask her and see And then if she does and you put a
4:34:57
ring on it right That way you don't have to like date her You could just get married to her You you skip some steps
4:35:02
So on a first date would you guys fold to do laundry starting with you
4:35:10
No No Do you you don't do laundry for others No Into the mic Into the mic
4:35:17
for others No For your perfect guy would you fold his laundry No No Why is this
4:35:24
perfect guy also always asking me to do weird stuff She's like my
4:35:30
perfect Are your parents still together Yeah They're married Yeah Uh in the
4:35:36
household like do they both work or Yeah They they both have jobs What What does your mom do She works uh at a high
4:35:43
school but not as a teacher in administration Yeah Okay And what does your dad do for work Um he used to be a
4:35:50
high school teacher but later he became a like environmental engineer I see Okay
4:35:56
So you wouldn't do a what Okay Not on the first date but like you're married
4:36:01
to the guy and he was like "Hey I'm going to I want to marry you but you
4:36:06
have to do all the household or No hold on You just have to do the laundry All the laundry in the house Would you do it
4:36:15
like this It's only in this condition will he marry me or what is this deal
4:36:21
like forever like I have to do the laundry for there could be extenduating circumstances like you're injured you're
4:36:29
extraordinarily sick there's uh external problems which happen and so
Laundry on the first date
4:36:36
because of those he does the laundry because you're unavailable to do so due to no fault of your own but for the most
4:36:43
part doing the laundry Is he doing the rest of the housework No
4:36:48
So who does the rest of the house Are we allowed to hire it out Yeah Get like a maid No No No Well and even if you could
4:36:57

4:42:58
little fun for Brian Have you ever seen the movie Casino Yes
4:43:04
Uh there's a scene at the very beginning where they're introducing the characters and I think it's
4:43:10
uh trying to remember who's the character narrating Joe Peshi's narrating I forgot the name of his
4:43:16
character in the film Robert Dairo plays the protagonist of the film I forgot his name in the movie Ace is his name in the
4:43:23
movie Yeah and he was do running sports betting when he was younger That's correct And they're all making a [ __ ]
4:43:28
ton of money And there's this there's this I can't I forgot exactly verbatim what he says but uh Ace was making the
4:43:36
the mob the mafia a [ __ ] ton of money But he needed protection Who put the protection on him Who put the the
4:43:42
Godfather put the protection of Joe Peshy on him bro But the point I was trying to make here is that in the scene
4:43:48
when Joe Peshi's narrating it he says something along the lines of "And he was making money hand over fist but he he
4:43:55
never had any [ __ ] fun with it." Yeah that's me Hold on let me let What the
4:44:01
[ __ ] is that What Hold on Uh casino transcript
4:44:07
Uh what I don't think the guy ever had any fun with it you know He just he did
4:44:12
it methodically That's basically what you're talking about Yeah Yeah Here I'll read it Nikki but the only thing he ever
4:44:19
directed was the casino He made his first bet when he was 15 years old and he always made money But he didn't bet
4:44:25
like you or me you know having some fun with it [ __ ] like that Uh wait hold on
4:44:31
Where the [ __ ] now It's Oh my god He bet like a brain surgeon Wait what Ah this
4:44:36

4:44:43
inside stuff nobody else knew and that's what what he'd put his money on Even back home years ago when we were first
4:44:49
hanging out together he'd know if the quarterback was on Coke Uh if his
4:44:54
girlfriend was knocked up he'd get the wind velocity so he could judge the field goals He even figured out the
4:45:00
different bounce you got off different kinds of wood they used on college b basketball courts You know he'd be
4:45:06
working on this [ __ ] day and night There was nothing about a game he wasn't going to bet that he didn't know Uh season
4:45:13
after season the prick was the only guaranteed winner I ever knew But he was so serious about it All that I All that
4:45:20
I don't think he Wait he was so serious about it All that I don't think he ever enjoyed himself But that's just the way
4:45:27
he was Brian that's me bro Did Did Ace need protection Brian
4:45:33
Yeah he also Yeah he needed protection Brian he also married a [ __ ] degenerate Did he need protection though
4:45:40
Brian Did he take his cowboy friend and beat his face in with a [ __ ] phone for disrespecting Ace Yes he did He did
4:45:47
need protection Yes he did Just saying Just pointing this out So I need fun protection No you just need to have some
4:45:52

4:53:52
minds like that would be the equivalent for uh the fish photo except you can
4:53:59
just dump hang on In Brian's defense in Brian's defense that woman would get way
4:54:05
more dates That's what I'm saying Way more dates Maybe for the wrong reasons I
4:54:12
think women just want like that's kind of like an inside thing between women
4:54:17
Like if a guy has a fish photo I feel like a lot of I've heard a lot of women talk about how they wouldn't go for a
4:54:23
guy if he has like fish photos on his Instagram Why Not me but I just have heard that I think it's just like Yeah
4:54:29
It's like an ongoing need It's like kind of like a joke Yeah Why I don't know What the hell is wrong
4:54:34
with so Did you see the size of the fish
4:54:40
That was not common Impressive It's an impressive fish Impressive fish to be able to reel in He can reel in the fish
4:54:47
just instantly you're like "Oh this guy likes fishing [ __ ] this guy." No Like what the [ __ ] did he do Like you have
4:54:54
only so many It's too much You know what too That guy looks like the type who catches the fish and then releases it He
4:55:00
does look like See I'm the [ __ ] type of prick I pull up those giant fish and I'm like I ain't putting it back [ __ ]
4:55:05
you I'm not There's no way I'm putting that back What are you going to do with that big ass fish Well I
4:55:11
just feel like you get it I'm not going to even do anything with it But it's mine You see how it's like it's mine
4:55:18
though So I'm like I don't need to do anything with it It's [ __ ] I caught it It's [ __ ] mine That's how that's
4:55:25
supposed to work Take a photo with it and then post it on a dating app It's It's kind of It's like a hobby It's like
4:55:30
their hobby They're expressing their hobby They like fishing We're taking that guy out for fishing trip Let's do it The Crucible is taking that guy out
4:55:36
for a fishing trip Also can we do this on I don't know if you saw this on Twitter Uh it's not dating related but
4:55:41
this poor kid like looked like a nine or 10 year old got beat up in a playground
4:55:47
by like a couple Shiloh Shiloh Huh Shiloh Shiloh No
4:55:52
nothing No no no Oh Shiloh Shiloh No no no It was this poor kid like a little chubby chubby kid He got like uh some
4:56:01
kids were making fun of him or they were throw I forgot Were they throwing rocks at his dog or I forgot I forgot what it
4:56:07
was And then these kids he confronted them and then one kid jumped him and then another it was like a twoon-one and
4:56:14
he was all bleeding and [ __ ] We I I kind of want to do something for that kid If anybody who's know watching who knows
4:56:20
what it is whatever Uh and then a bunch of like people on Twitter saw and all these MMA fighters offered them like uh
4:56:27
jiu-jitsu lessons and stuff So we can maybe back some of those MMA fighters up if
4:56:32
they help this kid out Yes I saw that That was that little Portland kid who
4:56:38
was in a fair fight and they got knocked out from behind It wasn't even a fair fight cuz the first one is a cheap shot
4:56:43
and then another kid came in and the other cheap shot totally [ __ ] up and he was crying It was cheap It was sad Um
4:56:51
so at least fight fair you know Yeah oneon-one It's stupid Uh Mary pull it
4:56:56
back up really quick Here's what we're going to do The panel I want you guys to give him a looks rating on a scale of 1
4:57:02
to 10 And don't lie Don't [ __ ] look Starting with you Give him a looks rating scale of 1 to 10 I think he's an
4:57:09
attractive guy I would say like [ __ ] love Am I allowed to say seven for them We can't say seven for ourselves but can
4:57:15
I say that for him You going to go on a date with him I am taken But if I was
4:57:20
single honestly I I'd be interested
4:57:27
If I ever single he's someone I would have swiped You know what You know what I feel like I feel like because you got
4:57:33
the backstory here that if I see what Brian should have done just pulled this up and said "What do you rate him?" I
4:57:39
think it would have been a two But because you have the backstory you don't want to feel like there's pressure on
Will they rate the man from Tinder?
4:57:44
you or like you would be a monster I would give him a two I mean to other women I know he he might be a two but I
4:57:51
mean you see what I'm saying Ryan I feel like I'm not lying I would tell the truth If the story wasn't told the
4:57:58
ratings would be different It's true What do you rate him on a scale of one to 10 Oh he's like a six Oh dude Six
4:58:05
Yeah Oh is the mute Oh I guess we gota skip it Okay
4:58:10
Party I give him the three The roof The three Okay I think people are going to judge me I give him a three Probably
4:58:17
like four or five Okay He looks like he gives good hugs I don't know why
4:58:22
that about to hear but okay I don't know He looks like a sweetheart Do does anybody rate based on hugs I do No you
4:58:30
come on I love me a [ __ ] break Oh you know what
4:58:35
I can't wait to go He looks like he gives good hug Are we writing strictly on looks though Because I can take
4:58:41
personality but we're just writing on just looks and what you saw You are
4:58:46
swiping I don't know whichever way [ __ ] women swipe on these apps but you come across this you see him Which
4:58:53
way you swiping I don't know The the next Yeah exactly I
4:58:59
don't know Left or right Uh what do you rate him I would say four Four Okay He's
4:59:05
kind of nerdy I like nerds but I give him like a five Give him a five
4:59:11
Okay You like hugs A [ __ ] hugs person You know what I do
4:59:18
He looks like he's a really good hugger No man Does Brian does any man ever want to hear you look like you give great
4:59:25
hugs Does anybody Oh come on That's terrible Why is that a bad thing Why is
4:59:30
that a bad thing Cuz what the man wants to hear is like "You look like you plant my face in the pillow." They don't want to hear "Oh you look like you give good
4:59:37
[ __ ] hugs." Imagine me Imagine me opening I want you you sounds friendzy
4:59:43
It's like a woman It does sound friendzone Yeah It's like a woman saying he he would make a great husband Yeah
4:59:50
that's brutal Oh wait That's not a compliment No it all has to be Because what that
4:59:58
because what that sounds like is like I wouldn't I wouldn't [ __ ] you but you do
He gives good HUGS?
5:00:03
seem like you're good husband material so I will [ __ ] you So but don't men kind of judge that way too Like that looks
5:00:10
like a whatever I'm going to try for that I'm going to [ __ ] her but I want to marry this girl cuz she looks like a good I think that men's criteria and
5:00:15
what they want in a wife is way less than what the criteria is for what women want So no No Well it's it's not just a
5:00:24
matter of looks I think that men look for maternal instinct Okay I think that they're looking for like women who could
5:00:31
be really good mothers for their kids So like if I were to see you and I saw the tats and this and that I'd be again no
5:00:38
offense but I'd instantly make the presupposition you're going to be a [ __ ] terrible mom [ __ ] that [ __ ] But
5:00:45
my priority is also children right Um other men might look at you and think
5:00:51
"Ah it should be a fun ride." Right Okay literally amusement park fun ride The
5:00:57
question becomes this though If for if you know kind of like all things equal I
5:01:02
think that men's standards for what they're looking for in wives is a much lower standard than what wives are
5:01:09
looking for for husbands It's like what are you looking for if you had perfect husband Are you
5:01:17
married right now I'm I'm single right now I wasn't single So let's go Perfect husband versus perfect wife What does
5:01:24
that look like Perfect husband versus perfect wife Yeah So your perfect
5:01:29
husband is what Um I think that that's somebody who is a provider not just for myself
5:01:36
but for the family the house the provider The provider is a Sure Um somebody who is leading by example
5:01:43
Somebody who's looking out for us to maybe correct us That would be strong moral character right Yes Strong moral
5:01:49
character Strong moral character and provider What next um somebody who provides some um emotional uh support in
5:01:57
that sense I think because I also bring some financial to the table but even if
The perfect husband
5:02:02
I didn't obviously be able to understand me to under go just like you were talking about earlier with the whole
5:02:08
once a once a month you're going you're out with your husband Mhm A guy walks over a rando and he grabs your ass your
5:02:15
husband's got to knock that [ __ ] out right In my opinion he's got to right In
5:02:20
my opinion yes Yeah he's got to So but I think that comes with being the leader
5:02:25
the protector So it's not just a matter of provider right Protector in the home
5:02:32
but it's also a matter of protector outside of the home Other people come of of myself and of our course Of course So
5:02:39
he's got to be strong and a little bit tough right He's got to be So there's actually a little bit more criteria here
5:02:45
isn't there Okay What is he looking for in you I don't know what he's looking for You don't know what he's looking for
5:02:51
No What is he looking for For me to just be I'm asking you what is he looking for What is this guy who's a great provider
5:02:58
He's [ __ ] epic The guy grabs your ass out in the club he's going to knock him the [ __ ] out What's he get I mean I
5:03:05
would reciprocate as much as I can on every other level I mean I can't beat up somebody No I'm not asking you to beat
5:03:11
up somebody What does he get Which is similar to what you're getting Loyalty Um you expect loyalty from him Yes
5:03:18
That's not something new you're bringing to the table Okay Him knocking a [ __ ] out is something you can't do right Okay So what is physical So so
And what he wants
5:03:27
so without the equalization you say loyalty you're going to get loyalty from a guy Um maybe loyalty and uh brings in
5:03:35
a lot of other things Um we talked about being submissive or subservient I know a lot of people take that as a negative
5:03:41
but it's like I'm I'm not really sure I've never really Right Not really sure I'm not
5:03:48
really sure because as you guys have said it doesn't take a lot more It doesn't Men don't So the standard is
5:03:54
lower for men I'm not saying the standard is lower It sure sounds like you're saying that I'm not saying the
5:03:59
standard is lower I'm just saying I've never really thought about that because literally because but men always think
5:04:05
about that That's what's so Yeah I don't think men always think about that Yeah they actually do They think about things
5:04:11
uh almost starting at a transactional rate right Like what do I get versus what you get and then they move into
5:04:17
what they'll settle for versus what they won't settle for right You're you what what you get is the privilege of saying
5:04:24
I've never really thought about that Isn't that kind of like slightly problematic
5:04:30
It's not But personally it's not only because personally I'm not actively
5:04:35
dating or searching for my ideal person Have I thought about it Maybe You've dated plenty right I' I've dated Sure
5:04:42
I've dated And it's still never crossed your mind I don't think it's a Okay
5:04:48
we're not still never crossed your mind It's It's not that it's never crossed my mind I think it's just in a way like so
5:04:56
I'm going to take it a couple steps back to where when I was married I kind of had my role switched where I was the one
5:05:03
financially providing I was the one you know my husband like a good wife like a good wife there's going to be times
5:05:09
occasionally perhaps your husband's sick perhaps he has problems I'm saying for the majority of my marriage I was the
5:05:15
one that did that so I think roles because I actually don't want to get
5:05:20
into the details of it so but but whatever reason is right My point is is from my perspective choose that man
5:05:26
though I did but I think I felt um years into it that there could have been forms
5:05:34
of manipulation or masking and when and when kids come into I'll just grant it all I'll just grant it all But you move
5:05:40
forward right So you're moving forward How could it be possible that you can tell me what your value is or the value
5:05:46
of women are But when I ask you the opposition like what is it that the man's getting on par You're confused and
5:05:53
don't know Cuz she doesn't have to Hang on Let her answer Go ahead No no no It's okay Can you Can you say that to me one
5:05:59
more time Yeah Yeah What were you confused about You said I'm confused I'm not really sure
5:06:06
I think because I've never been in a relationship I haven't gotten past a few dates Um I know you don't like the word
5:06:14
trauma but maybe I was a little traumatized from my marriage that I don't really know what a strong person
5:06:19
should look like um in a maybe traditional more conservative type of relationship which is something I would
5:06:25
like to seek based off of hearsay and other people's um anecdotal kind of
5:06:30
situations But I think that's why it's harder for me to say because I'm not sure Let's pretend that we take you and
5:06:37
we take you out of your skin and we put you in a man's skin right Okay So women
5:06:44
supposedly are great at empathy I've never thought so I've always thought men were mo more empathetic and I have great
5:06:50
uh reasoning ability to demonstrate they're more empathetic but I'm just going to leave it and assume for a second women are actually more
5:06:57
empathetic Just because you lead with empathy doesn't mean you're actually more empathetic from my view But here's
5:07:03
what I would say Let's take you We're going to put you in a man's skin You swipe across yourself
5:07:09
at like 35 You're a 35-year-old man You've been in the dating field This and that I look at you What do I see
5:07:17
Um I see Let's start with negatives Okay Negatives
5:07:23
[Music] Um okay You're really asking me to look at myself So look
5:07:29
at Hold on Let me let me put myself out right Okay If I'm a guy So hang on Let
5:07:34
me let me let me let's do this again I want to make sure there's no confusion Okay You are supposing in your mind
5:07:40
hypothetically you're a man tomorrow You wake up You have your same mind everything else and
5:07:47
you're looking to date You swipe across yourself Uhhuh What are the negative
5:07:53
things you see Um I think the first thing is going to be age What is this
5:07:59
person doing on a dating app at her age What age is that I'm 38 Okay So but I'm
What are the negative things about herself
5:08:05
not on dating There's plenty of 40-year-olds on dating app There are there are plenty of them So what are the negatives Okay So I think for men that
5:08:11
would be a negative I feel like a lot of men look for younger women So that would be one Okay Um I think depending on the
5:08:17
person I know you mentioned tattoos That could be something I got my tattoos with my You're a man I am a man in this in
5:08:24
this hypothetical What do you see when you see the tattoos on the sleeves and the arms Um tell me what you see as a
5:08:32
man I I don't know I don't You don't know The
5:08:37
reason why I'm telling you this is because you know I'm looking what type of tattoos does she have Maybe the
5:08:43
person that I'm looking for will be similar to me I have anime tattoos on me I have you know what I mean Like these
5:08:48
are all This is from video gaming Maybe she's a little bit of nerd if I'm being observant If I don't like If I don't
5:08:54
like You got seven [ __ ] seconds that you're looking at these Hang on Hang on 7 seconds looking at this profile Yeah
5:09:01
exactly If that So 3 seconds what do I see I'm you What do I see Let me
5:09:07
actually take this back because you're like let's look at the negatives But if I start Hang on hang on We'll get to all
5:09:13
the positives No I don't Forget the positives I just want to see the negatives first Forget all the negatives No [ __ ]
5:09:19
[ __ ] [ __ ] Cope Start with the negatives It's actually not to cope What I'm trying to tell you is I'm looking as
5:09:25
a guy going on a dating app Yeah They probably would see me as "Oh she's showing skin." Maybe the age I can put
5:09:32
to the side Okay Age is put to the side So age Okay So okay She's showing skin What does the skin Well let's start
5:09:38
We're going to do Hang on We're going to do one at a time which can be seen as a negative What is the skin what do you think the skin is signifying to the guy
5:09:46
Um I think she's you know comfortable with showing herself a little bit She's
5:09:52
probably a little bit more outgoing She's not going to be Does it Does it
5:09:57
signify permiscuity Maybe Um I think for a majority of men Yes Okay So we got
5:10:02
that What's next What's the next negative Uh I don't know That's it Those
5:10:08
are all the negatives You show a little bit of skin That's it That's the only thing they see on the dating profile If
5:10:13
I have 7 seconds I'm seeing age I'm seeing skin I'm seeing tattoos If you don't like the tattoos um maybe I mean I
5:10:21
don't want to necessarily say but maybe racially not their preference Hang on let's back up I want to show you
5:10:26
something that's interesting and I think you'll agree Okay there's uh many many videos many videos of an infant dropping
5:10:35
from a high altitude off of like a rail or something like that and a man
5:10:41
catching and a man catching him okay Or even a woman catching him Okay now think
5:10:46
about this An infant falls off of like a fourstory balcony you have how many
5:10:53
seconds You just have to react like that right But all of the things that are
5:10:59
processing in that microsecond is like this kid's going to die Here's what's
5:11:04
going on You can process so much information in a microcond Okay but we
5:11:11
can't do that with a dating app I just hang on We can do that with a dating spend less than 7 seconds on So if that
5:11:18
is the case right And I can make a like a microcosm decision as to when to die
5:11:26
for that infant processing all that information in a nancond right And catch
5:11:32
it You should be able to tell me what you see as the negative within that same nanocond about yourself I guess show I
5:11:39
don't I told you the biggest thing that I think would be a negative The biggest things because it's like a quick thing
5:11:44
is the age and the showing of skin Those are the biggest tattoos I did mention
5:11:51
tattoos in case someone doesn't know So that's the third negative Anything else It could be a negative Anything else Um I don't know I don't know Now if we pull
5:11:57
that picture up let's do this as an experiment Brian where are you Pull that picture back up of the fisherman Okay I
5:12:04
want to show you something interesting We got three things from you Okay Right
5:12:09
Don't [ __ ] us You got three seconds to evaluate Give
5:12:16
me all the negatives and tell the truth They'll see right through it if you
5:12:21
don't Tell us the truth What do you see The only negatives that I can see and I'll be honest are the fact that he
5:12:27
might be overweight Okay He's overweight What else That's it He's got other than that he's got a great smile He has good
5:12:33
energy Yes he's got a big ass fish I've gone fishing I know what that's about Mhm Nice background All mostly positives
5:12:38
The biggest thing is that he might be overweight Not my type That's it Huh Yeah There's nothing else Let me see
5:12:45
what it said on the thing If I read If I actually take the time to read it cuz most guys won't read what's on the bio
5:12:51
If I'm If I'm not home you can find me at the lake There you go So because he's single he spends time on the lake
5:12:58
fishing Okay Okay All right So did the chat see through that Sounds
5:13:03
a bit It does sound a bit copish but Okay What do you mean when you say copish I know you've mentioned that even
5:13:08
earlier I'm just I'm just so like cope is the idea that
5:13:14
um you know that there's some type of problem but you refuse to acknowledge it
5:13:21
So you give excuses for the problem That's called cope Right Okay So what would you say about him then There's
5:13:27
more that you see about that Oh man I could give a laundry list In fact let me
5:13:33
just make it even easier I'll give a laundry list about me right Okay I'm [ __ ] old right I'm setting my ways I
5:13:40
got a [ __ ] beer gut right I mean what do you think I'm literally Hang on hang on hang on hang on hang on I'm literally
5:13:47
I'm literally a [ __ ] abrasive I don't give a [ __ ] what most people think But even just off of a picture if I give put
5:13:54
my best self forward right it would still be something akin to like some
5:14:01
interest that I had or some [ __ ] like that And he would still look at it and be like "He's old right Maybe his teeth
5:14:08
are a little crooked Maybe his eyebrow is a little too cur Whatever the [ __ ] it is there would be all kinds of things
5:14:14
that you could associate with me just on a picture look that would disqualify me instantly Right now you don't get to see
5:14:21
the fact that I'm extraordinarily charming and charismatic but what you would see is just the picture image
5:14:28
right And that's it And there's no [ __ ] way that all of that is not processing the same time you look at
5:14:34
that guy with that fish There's just no way I think if I'm looking at it in a split second and going "This guy is not
5:14:40
my type I'm not thinking about it anymore." But I also don't It's intuitive right It's Sure I'm not
5:14:45
thinking all the other things This isn't a dunk on you No no no no I and I'm not taking it that way And again as I've
5:14:51
said I think that Holy [ __ ] she got two babies Wow there's twins Brian those are
5:14:56
twins Brian twins Yeah but I mean if you'll note if you'll note two separate fathers
5:15:02
Oh my god I mean it's not the same dad Well no How can they be twins What I
5:15:12
don't know What do you mean Okay Uh have you ever have you ever
5:15:18
heard of a recessive gene you [ __ ] racist This is [ __ ] ridiculous There's no recessive gene from the drink
5:15:26
it or dispose of I think my biggest thing though is I think that dating apps are terrible I haven't done dating apps
5:15:32
I don't think that if I met that personated $1,000
5:15:39
pop champagne So my wife asked and I accepted She says that her attraction to

equivalent Like men don't get that [ __ ] You know what I mean Like the new
5:21:27
Oblivion came out the new Oblivion game and uh it's remastered and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it And man what
5:21:35
I rolled was epic I made my own class It's called a paladin class and it literally focuses on restoration and
5:21:41
blade and a few other things and it's not in the game Is that a don't [ __ ] up my monologue So we get in we get into
5:21:49
Oblivion right I got it My wife comes out and she's like "Honey what are you doing?" I said "It's Oblivion Get the [ __ ] out of here." And she was like
5:21:55
"Absolutely." And I sat down and I played it for 13 [ __ ] hours straight and I wasn't done I couldn't wait the
5:22:02

5:22:22
up the weekend or is it [ __ ] the weekend I called I did the equivalent of
5:22:29

5:22:36
So good Guys twitch.tv/ whatever Drop us a follow Drop us a prime sub Like the video Venmo Cash app Whatever TTS What
5:22:43
You play Oblivion Uh I saw the trailer for the remastered Uh it's good I played
5:22:49
it like way back like originally briefly that I didn't get to I was more World of Warcraft you know I was more Okay guys
5:22:56
Stifler ask everyone to rate their own looks on a scale of 1 to 10 You can't
Rating 1-10
5:23:02
pick seven starting with you Go ahead I knew this question Okay So last time I was on I said six or six and a half and
5:23:08
apparently I'm incorrect to your audience So I'll I'll go down to a five
5:23:17
All right Was I too mean before Do you think I was too mean You did laugh Um you weren't
5:23:24
here in person so I think it was depersonalized I don't blame you I'm not mad at I still agree with my former
5:23:30
position even though I'm here in person There is no possible way you can give yourself that a certain a five No way I
5:23:39
mean I see myself in the dating pool I am partnered So clearly let's All right
5:23:45
Before we get into it why don't we have everybody everybody go Eight and a half Okay there you eight and a half There
5:23:51
you go Now you got to do it You got to answer the question Is she passed her time Oh no The the mute's over Oh it is
5:23:57
Yeah mute's over Damn Mom was enjoying the [ __ ] out of that So were we
5:24:02
Oh you guys was great Five Okay Oh no A six Okay A 10
5:24:10
Oh wait Did Was it Was it on this was it on this angle when she said "Oh okay 10." 10
5:24:17
Okay Yes 7.5 Six Andrew what do you give yourself I
5:24:25
don't know [ __ ] three or two Uh so over here though I got to ask you to the Ted right Yeah I just want to be sure Do
5:24:34
you think you're the prettiest girl at the table Obviously not No That's weird
5:24:39
How come I'm pretty to myself I'm pretty What was the question though On rate our own looks on a scale of 1 to
5:24:46
10 Can't pick seven I chose 10 Our own Oh but I don't understand You consider
5:24:54
yourself to be a 10 by your own scale but you consider that there's other women at the table who are more
5:24:59
attractive than you who lower their own rates for themselves That's that's what they think of themselves But this is
5:25:05
what I think of myself I personally think I'm a 10 I'm not saying I'm the 10 out of everyone
5:25:10
But somebody spin the helicopter on All right Well let me ask you Let me ask you this It's actually an
5:25:18
important question and there's a reason what we think we're answering for like what you would think general population
5:25:24
Well here's the thing that's interesting right Like objective Well everything moves into the perception The question
5:25:31
being asked itself is just a determined delusion Very simple right So we could
5:25:38
assume that if I asked every man that I walked across rate yourself on a scale
5:25:43
of 1 to 10 by looks how would you rate yourself I think that the majority of
5:25:48
men I came across would rate themselves somewhere between a four and a six even if they were very good-looking For
5:25:54
instance there's a man right now who's watching this podcast Guarantee it His
5:25:59
name is Jake He's better looking than from the female standard all of you And from the male standard all of us right
5:26:06
He would never rate himself a [ __ ] 10 in a million years The question becomes
5:26:12
why do you Is it because A you misheard the question because I don't think you did cuz you repeated it Mhm Or B is it
5:26:19
because you have a false sense of security when it comes to your own looks I don't have a false sense of security I
5:26:26
think I think I'm attractive to myself Yeah Yeah Sure So if there was 100 men
5:26:32
and they were all in an audience and you went up in front of the audience and they had to rate you right behind them
5:26:38
all of the women on this panel came behind you and then they gave their ratings after Where would they place you
5:26:45
I don't know What do you think though I'm not sure Of course you're not sure That's why I'm just asking you for like
5:26:52
what your subjective opinion would be You I don't know It's You don't know
5:26:57
your own subjective opinion out of a group No Okay If it's other people rating me I don't know what they would
5:27:03
think Well let me ask a different question for all the women who are here I'm asking for honesty I'm not sure I'll
5:27:10
get it but I am asking for it When all of you sat down and you made an assessment of your surroundings as human
5:27:17
beings tend to do Did you at any point scale things on the sense of like her
5:27:23
hair is nice her body is nice her skin is nice I wish I had eyebrows like hers
5:27:30
I wish I had eyelashes like hers Did any of you make those assessments Sure Can
5:27:36
you raise your hand if you did Yeah Why I think it's just like naturally
5:27:41
when you're like meeting new people and that's like the first thing that you know about them you just kind of go off of your their looks fair Why
5:27:51
Um I don't know I think that's because that's what people like she said that's what you your first impression of a
5:27:56
person is what you see And we are just by nature We can do we do comparisons like that Why Yeah Just natural It's
5:28:04
instinct Same Same I like looking at people
5:28:09
I think I'm not very happy with my own body image So you compare yourself to others Yeah Fair Just acknowledging
5:28:17
other people Just acknowledging Okay We forgot to rate ourselves by the way Click on these No he did You're rating
5:28:23
What Uh we forgot to rate ourselves if I recall I rated myself Oh did I forget I
5:28:29
give myself a five Okay Sorry Sorry So well I didn't forget Brian But anyway uh
5:28:34
back to this So the very idea to me then becomes all of you made assessments in
5:28:42
comparison to the other women who were there And if you're making those comparisons did any of you let me just
5:28:49
ask this by hand raise sit at the table and think that there was other women at
5:28:54
the table who are more attractive than you by hand raise Go ahead and raise your hand if that's the
5:29:00
case That makes sense to me as well So when we get to the rating system what do
5:29:06
you think we're asking here Like what do you think we're asking here Clearly there's a diametric
5:29:12
difference and distinction between the looks of some of the women on this panel versus others It's not even an insult
5:29:19
There's massive differences in looks between the men who are here right now Obviously I'm very much better looking
5:29:25
than Brian But the point Yeah exactly But the point is right is
5:29:32
that obviously there's distinctions here So so do on that assessment
5:29:39
understanding that that is the case understanding that you even grant that you were making those judgments would
5:29:45
any of your self-ratings change by a show of hands
5:29:50
No Not a single one Nope No Okay I said what I'll say Okay Well I got you know I
5:29:56
got some stuff I want to say Um do you have carry the show Andrew Don't carry the show Andrew What the [ __ ] Brian A
5:30:02
lot of mixed emotions Brian I can't keep up with you Andrew You've
5:30:08
been getting me sloshed off of vodka All this I've been You drink heavily I
5:30:13
rarely drink What do you mean I drink heavily I barely drink Okay You drink mostly heavily Most of
5:30:20
the time Rude I'm having to smoke every other I can't take this [ __ ] Brian what the You just said you were hotter than
5:30:26
me What's that What's that Hey I was Did you hear how he said that He said that
5:30:31
like I I like said like I'm his son Wait a second And I said I like I cursed
5:30:38
What the [ __ ] I dude I actually No When he said that I felt fear You should like the [ __ ] did you just say [ __ ] Okay
5:30:46
hang on In my defense from the charismatic perspective It was a way Hang on Hang on It was a way to provide
5:30:53
like a sense of comedic relief It's not because I actually think that I'm better looking than Brian even if I am Oh no It
5:30:59
was a joke Even if I'm not I'm not upset by it You seem pretty upset by it I'm not What the [ __ ] I'm not upset
5:31:07
Nobody's convinced Brian Are is anybody convinced Brian's not upset I'm going to show Show of hands I think you're upset
5:31:13
I have captured the entire I've captured the entire panel I've captured them Turn
5:31:18
them against me You're going to turn them against me Well I'll ask a couple questions Uh to you the 10 the soul 10
5:31:25
at the table Can you tell us a guy like maybe a celebrity famous person that you think
5:31:32
is a 10 I think is a 10 Yeah Like a guy who you think is a 10
5:31:44
No celebrity crushes Okay One eternity left
5:31:53
Maybe uh Messi the soccer player
5:31:59
Cute Okay Okay All right My whole plan is failed right
5:32:06
Wondered in terms of looks you're talking about He's cute
Famous male TENS
5:32:14
I mean he's rich and one of the best soccer players ever and status and successful and all that
5:32:23
It's like an average looking guy though I mean he's average looking guy I don't
5:32:29
need a 10 out When you say 10 like come on Really Like don't look 10 Is he a 10 because of all the
5:32:36
other [ __ ] surrounding him The fact that he's one of the best soccer players ever No he's just cute He's cute Wait is cute
5:32:44
a 10 Can you be a 10 and cute I feel like 10 is like like jaw-dropping You
5:32:49
literally they walk past you and you just are in awe Your head snaps and you
5:32:56
turn Head turn Think of a different celebrity then Sure Give me a different celebrity He's also kind of short I
5:33:03
don't care about He's probably shorter than you maybe I don't know Okay I don't think he is He's a great guy though What Uh give me a different celebrity
5:33:13
Can it be a girl celebrity No it has to be a man Has to be man Um
5:33:18
Michael B Jordan I guess then Mhm Okay real fine Michael Jordan Michael Jordan
5:33:24
Michael B Jordan Huge difference Oh yeah He was in Have you slid Have you sled
5:33:29
slid into his DMs No Why would I do that No he's I'm pretty sure he's married
5:33:35
I mean why would I sign into his DMs I didn't know he was married Is he Uh so
5:33:41
that's So you're a 10 he's a 10 Uh is that you think that's a good Would if he was single would that be a good match No
5:33:50
So he would be settling for you Yeah Oh
5:33:57
okay You're both tens bro Okay bro Tell me bro What's up dog
5:34:05
Okay Thing is what's up dog Tell me dude Thing is one he's significantly older than me so I think that'd be a
5:34:11
dealbreaker Two for for you or for him for him and possibly for me too I mean I don't mind but for probably for him Okay
5:34:17
Too He is rich and famous I don't think he wants to settle for a hostess in a little town barely anybody knows about
5:34:25
Yeah but guys don't really care about a woman's status I don't It just wouldn't
5:34:31
be a good match I don't want someone famous That would be inconvenient All right Uh name taken says "So wait
5:34:36
Oblivion is the reason we haven't had any Tik Tok invasions recently." Andrew Fair
5:34:41
Uh no I've given you guys actually more Tik Tok invasions recently than you've ever gotten even with Oblivion But
5:34:48

5:37:33
57 Uhhuh Okay Uh what about Oh and clarification You're 29 Were you better
5:37:38
looking at 19 or better looking now Honestly I'd say pretty even
5:37:47
Can you just tilt your mic down a little bit Okay Pretty even What about you Uh 37 better looking at 27 No I was around
5:37:52
400 lb back then Uh and then 18 versus 37 Even bigger Even bigger back then
5:37:58
Damn Okay Uh you're 37 better looking in 10 years time at 47
5:38:04
Back up All right Yeah Go ahead Go ahead Go ahead No Uh and
5:38:12
then were you better looking at 27 versus now at 37 No Better looking now Okay And then 18 versus 37 Better
5:38:19
looking now Better now Okay You're 38 Better looking uh in 10 years time No Okay And then going back 10 years 28
5:38:25
versus 38 No I was probably prime at like 35 few years ago Yeah So 3 years
5:38:31
ago And then 18 versus 38 I don't know That's almost a different person We look like two different people
5:38:38
18 and me now So what Yeah Which one's better looking I guess I I think that that's going to be a little bit
5:38:44
subjective At 18 I looked very young like a like a little girl still a middle schooler So it Okay but you were an
5:38:50
adult But I mean 18 sure but Yeah Yeah Well were you better looking at 18 or 38
5:38:57
I don't know I don't think I can answer that All right that's fine Uh 18 Will you be better looking in 10 years time
5:39:02
Yes 20 years time possibly but I'll say yes 30 years time at 48 No Okay You're
5:39:10
29 better looking in 10 years time at 39 No And then you're 29 Were you better looking at 19 or better looking now at
5:39:17
29 Thank god 19 Wow That might be the first ever honest
5:39:22
answer ever on this Here's Okay she's pretty rational She's been asking very rational very based questions the entire
5:39:29
night She's been like "Can you justify the [ __ ] that you're saying?" And I'm like "Actually I would prefer to do
5:39:36
that." It checks out Uh so here's what we've done We've put every single one of you
5:39:42
into an AI filter We've aged But before you show that filter can I can I ask can
5:39:48
I ask a couple of questions Actually I'm going to start with you guys because I'm always I'm always wondering about this
5:39:55
So you said if you were to retract time Mhm you're more attractive now than you
5:40:00
used to be So if I go back 10 years you're more attractive now Yeah Now let's say that you have the same access
5:40:07
to the resources you do right now Oh hang on And you had the same like
5:40:13
thought process on giving yourself augmentations whether they're breast
5:40:18
implants or or lipo or whatever they are right I don't know what they are and I
5:40:24
don't care But I'm just saying whatever they are you had the same like mindset for that and for exercise diet this
5:40:30
would you be as attractive now as you were then Yeah it was sobbriety Back then I wasn't sober and I look terrible
5:40:37
That's so Yeah So if I have sobriety back then and I have that Oh my god Yeah
5:40:42
that's okay So you just made poor choices when you're younger Yes But if it was equalized you still think you
5:40:48
would be attractive when you were younger Uh that I might be more attractive 10 years ago if I was sober
5:40:54
then I might still look the same I don't know Um but yeah it definitely a lot of it had to do with like drinking a ton
5:41:01
Okay And looking terrible Same over here I think at 18 if I was more cuz I mean I wear makeup and stuff Again very young I
5:41:07
think if I had all the same access Um I mean I guess my assumption was we don't have like we're in 10 years from now
5:41:14
We're not talking about like oh no I understand I understand Okay Okay I just want to make sure I'm getting this correctly At 18 sure if I wasn't still
5:41:21
very young minded I had my mind now I was maybe taking care of myself Sure Then at 18 I probably would be more
5:41:26
attractive than I was at 35 Here's why I bring this up I ask this question often I'll ask it real quick to this panel
5:41:33
before he pulls up the AI images right and we'll just do it by a show of hands
5:41:38
Um if I were to ask you who's the fairest sex men or women Let's start with men by hand
5:41:46
raise Let's start with now Let's do women by hand raise Are they the fairer sex Fair meaning Yes Better looking Are
Will you be more attractive in ten years
5:41:55
men or women the better-l looking sex Is it men by a hand raise Is it women by a hand raise Okay
5:42:02
So basically everybody says women Now let me ask it this way If it is the case
5:42:09
that women no longer have access to makeup or any sort of augmentation meaning breast implants meaning lip
The fairer sex
5:42:15
fillers meaning any period If I ask the same question who is the fairest sex men
5:42:22
or women Raise your hand if your answer changes you I think it might Yeah cuz I
5:42:31
think that there's a lot of men who are naturally like pretty attractive and they don't have to do a lot of like
5:42:38
changing to their appearance but there's some women who are like attractive just solely on like their extra stuff My
5:42:45
challenge would be this Men have not changed much since 1800 If you go back and look at pictures right there's still
5:42:52
no makeup for us and there's still basically just beards We get beards We don't get much else All right We get
5:42:59
beards and that's about it The ones who are lucky Yeah The same Yeah Exactly Same thing in the 1800s right But if you
5:43:05
go back and look at the women of that time versus the women of now I think you would be way more
5:43:13
hardpressed when you're talking about who is the fairer sex when we get rid of all the augmentation and makeup That's
5:43:19
all I'm saying I thought men did wear makeup They did I mean well no joke they
5:43:24
didn't The white face like English times Yeah Yeah But the but even in those
5:43:30
times women still wore makeup and men usually only wore it when they were in courtly positions But are you looking at
5:43:37
them though from a male or female gaze I feel like I would look at it from both So but I don't think you can see the way
5:43:42
that like maybe a woman might look at a man and go "Yeah I feel like I'm way better at juxtaposing myself in the
5:43:48
shoes of women than women are good at juxtaposing themselves in the seat of a man." Okay So when I look at it from the
5:43:54
woman's perspective right I understand why women think in modernity especially
5:43:59
that women are the fairer sex but they have every shortcut available which men
5:44:04
don't We have two choices banger bodies and beards That's about it Good choice
5:44:10
We can't we can't decide on balding We can't decide on any of these things right We have those two things And you
5:44:17
can't shortcut those two things If you're a man you don't get a banger body Some of it's genetic but you got to be
5:44:22
[ __ ] disciplined no matter what right Men can't wear makeup they uh get shamed if they do lipo suction they do height
5:44:28
extensions they do any of these types of augmentations [ __ ] no That's that's out
5:44:34
right Woman gets a butt implant great Boob implants great Tummy tuck great Lip filler great Massive amounts of makeup
5:44:41
great And that's why it's like are they really the sex You know when we start to
5:44:47
break it down are they That's a good point Men don't have to do anything They just roll over and look I always said that too Men could just roll over and
5:44:53
like look amazing and you're like but that's because I still think that women appreciate and find older men attractive
5:44:59
where men as a majority look at women younger as more attractive So that's why I bring up the male female gays Yeah I
5:45:06
understand the the distinction That goes back to the trench coat thing though If you're taking a bare naked woman bare
5:45:12
naked man and you're exposed themselves I think you know it it kind
5:45:18
of sucks for guys but the bottom line of it is no vagina
5:45:23
carrying person at this table has to do much but carry a vagina and we're going to get play Correct Women don't have to
5:45:29
We are already the only sex I mean that's just what it is Well put That's right That's right You know we're going
5:45:35
to actually save the AI thing for a little later Mary pull up the one though Here's that Fisher guy as a woman now
5:45:42
Look Wow She's super She's a bit big boned Every [ __ ] 50% of the guys you
5:45:48
saw her is going to bing her right She She downloads Tinder She's getting laid that night Yeah That hour You mean that
5:45:55
hour That hour Sure Yeah Total differential Just thought it was If she put like come over right now and [ __ ] me
5:46:02
she's getting [ __ ] right I mean they don't Girls don't got to even be direct But if they did yeah sure
5:46:09
She would get a guy It would come off pretty sleazy but yeah she could do it All right so here's what we're going to do We're going to get into the
5:46:15
questionnaire So we're going to uh let's see I don't think there's really anything on the height thing that's I
5:46:21
found particularly shocking Uh Joey uh no actually yeah
5:46:29
nothing too crazy on the height We'll just do bear then Uh would you rather cross paths with a random man or random bear on the hike I think I put man
5:46:37
I think that's what I put What about you Pick the bear any day You random bear Random bear Okay I said man
5:46:45
You wrote neither but you have to pick one I'll pick one Um probably man Probably ma'am Man Okay Uh why do you
5:46:53
pick bear Why did you pick bear There was a time I was actually hiking and I was out in Zion and this guy started
5:46:59
following me Uh okay Yeah And in that moment I I was like "Fuck if there was a bear the bear probably would have run
5:47:05
away." Because the bear is probably thinking about eating me or chasing me The man may be thinking about killing me
Man or Bear
5:47:11
murdering me What kind of augmentations do I have Um all of those other things
5:47:16
that some of the men think about your augmentations I mean all of the things that we kind of brought up today or that
5:47:22
some of the men brought up today is why I would choose a bear over a male any day Here's what I'm going to do on this
5:47:27
one So me and Andrew would just totally
5:47:32
just totally destroy you guys on this debate So here's what I'm going to do I'm just going to state I'm not going to
5:47:39
debate categorically that we've won the debate without even arguing the points
5:47:44
Sure Um the thing to do Why you robbing me Andrew said why you robbing me Cuz
5:47:50
there's better stuff if you can stay longer I'm staying for a second If you can stay No I can't stay for longer but I'm going to if if the heart's out Yeah
5:47:57
I'd rather get it to other stuff then Uh okay So let's see here But I I do like
5:48:02
the preemptive declaration of victory I'm a big fan of that Sure Yeah it was uh Okay so it was men versus women and
5:48:09
we were outnumbered and we still won exactly how it should be Would you Andrew what would interest you more the tea stuff or the like uh women oppressed
5:48:16
feminism stuff Let's start with tea and moved on to feminism Okay so we'll be quick on the tea I'll make a little bit of extra time if
5:48:23
necessary through it All right So we have uh let's see Uh Moon you say it's
5:48:30
wrong to re refuse to date a transgender person because they are trans And in addition to that uh Gabby you said a man
5:48:38
dating a or you agree a man dating a transgender woman is straight And you also say you agree a man dating a
5:48:45
transgender woman is straight So that's Gabby that's you And then uh Moon you
5:48:52
said you didn't say that it's straight but you did say it's wrong to refuse to date a transgender person because
5:48:58
they're trans We'll start there Uh why Just curious So if I refuse to date a transgender woman that would be wrong
5:49:04
Why is that Depends on your reasoning for not dating her Is it just because she's trans
5:49:10
Um yes sure Um I believe personally that a transgender woman is in fact a woman
5:49:19
So if you if you're speaking biologically if she's had biological surgery that presents as a female I
That talk about those people
5:49:27
believe that is presenting as a female It's like if you drive a truck I mean you you Let me give you let let's try to
5:49:35
I'll be as good faith on this as possible if you are So let's let's back up Yeah What is a woman for for you What
5:49:42
does that mean For me as a woman who dates women I would say someone feminine
5:49:49
someone probably with breast probably with a vagina Um
5:49:55
like a real one you know real as in Yeah a physical vagina Yeah Uh-huh Like born
5:50:01
with it No Not necessarily No So let me ask you this If I were to ask you if I
5:50:08
let's let's pretend for a second I'm like your 10-year-old son All right and I come to you and I say
5:50:14
"Mom I'm not gay but I'm going to go suck my girlfriend's dick." "I'm not gay but I'm going to go suck my girlfriend's
5:50:21
dick." All right I hear you How do you reconcile that with him Or no
5:50:27
not 10 Let's say like 14 How do you reconcile that with him and be like
5:50:32
"Uh no you're right That's not a gay act to go suck your girlfriend's dick." Can
5:50:38
you just like walk me through the logic there Yeah I know it's probably going to be different than yours but first of all I
5:50:44
wouldn't care because that's my child I'm not saying you care I'm not saying that from your view There's anything
5:50:50
that's wrong with that All right we're asking a specific question about homosexuality heterosexuality gay or
5:50:57
straight He's asking this question Is it gay if I do that Am I a gay person if I
5:51:05
go suck my girlfriend's dick You say to him what
5:51:10
have fun Yeah I know But but that's not What's his question though
5:51:16
My son wouldn't have a question He Yeah I know But if he did but if he did what what what is this question that I asked
5:51:22
you You're gay is a term that people in society chose to to describe your
5:51:30
sexuality Whatever my child whatever descriptor he wants to use to describe
5:51:35
his sexuality that's up to him It doesn't matter who he's Yeah I know Well what's Okay I I what I'm asking you for
5:51:42
repeat back to me the question that your 14-year-old son's asking you I'm having
5:51:48
sex with a transgender woman Am I No No No What's the question your son's asking
5:51:53
you Maybe I'm not gay If I suck my girlfriend's dick mom am I gay I want
5:52:00
you to repeat that so I know that you know what he's asking If I suck my girlfriend's dick am I gay Yeah Okay
5:52:07
What is How do you walk him through that Tell me Easy Okay Do you like this
5:52:14
person Sure He likes this person Does this person like you Absolutely Are y'all going to be engaging in this
5:52:20
sexual activity in a safe place He says "Sure." All right Are their parents okay
5:52:26
with it since they're probably both minors Sure They say sure Have fun Okay Great But but what what's the question
5:52:33
though There is none And for for there to be one I would not even say that I was a loving parent towards my child if
5:52:41
there was any other question that didn't involve their happiness and their safety So you just basically never answer the
5:52:48
question No cuz there isn't one right Okay And then who who was the next one Yeah So uh Gabby you said that it's
5:52:57
straight for a man to date a transgender So Gab Gabby your son comes to you I'm going to ask you the same question And
5:53:04
he says "Hey mom." Right I'm 15 I can make my own decisions
5:53:10
now I'm in a sexual relationship I'm going to suck my girlfriend's dick Is that gay No Can you walk me Hang on Can
5:53:17
you walk me through what you would say Wait why did they got to be 15 16
5:53:24
whatever 18 Because Because that's She's the mom And so I'm like 15 16 17
5:53:31
whatever Okay Yeah Whatever It doesn't matter Um it's irrelevant for the point
5:53:36
Do they present as a girl as a woman Sure Oh no It's not gay That's a lady
5:53:41
Lady with a dick A lady with a dick Yep I'm a lady with a dick when I want to I
5:53:47
mean so does that make my partner hetero when I wear a strap I mean well hang on
5:53:52
I feel like you just lied to me How Do Do you have a physical penis Nope Well
5:53:57
then why did you just say you're a lady with a dick You just lied Cuz a dick is something that goes inside a vagina It doesn't have to have blood So a cucumber
5:54:03
is a dick if you use it as such I mean Oh yeah So a cucumber if you attach it
5:54:10
to I feel like I feel like uh when I say the word dick I mean a penis that is
5:54:16
attached to a male And when you say dick you don't actually mean the word dick I
5:54:21
sure don't because Exactly So what you do is you just avoid the question No Because does the girl get off on the
5:54:28
cucumber or does the person with the Sure Let's just assume they do This would be like me saying [ __ ] is
5:54:35
like peanut butter If I got peanut butter bro If I got a a a piece of meat
5:54:40
from the grocery store Mhm and made love to it that that's a [ __ ] Not at all
5:54:47
That's not the same at all Not the same You literally said like a banana or like a cucumber would be a dick Oh obviously
5:54:53
a piece of meat isn't the same shape or anatomy as a [ __ ] mango I don't know Whatever the [ __ ] looks like No Well
5:54:58
maybe if you said like if you carved a piece of meat into a dildo and put meat in it Is there such a thing as a dildo
5:55:06
Of course there is Is there such a thing as a male penis Is a male penis Like a Yeah What's the difference between the
5:55:13
two One has blood pumping through it one does not Okay great So then it is the case that if I were to say to you that
5:55:20
you're going over to suck your girlfriend's penis we're talking about one category not the other right Right
5:55:26
We're talking about a flesh what I call a fleshy penis Okay So if we are talking about that then how can you possibly say
5:55:33
a cucumber is a penis to you because the same way if I put on a strap tonight and I go home and my You have made the
5:55:40
category differential that that's a dildo and not a penis No it's not about the So it's not about the equipment It's
5:55:46
about the wearer If you put on a fake vagina today right now and you said to
5:55:51
us I am now a woman I have on a quote fake vagina Wait it's fake though I mean
5:55:57
that's why I'm saying it is fake to us It may be but if you are presenting and telling us to respect you as a female
5:56:05
person but is it true Do you do you believe it's true I know Okay Of course
5:56:11
not It's it's like objectively not true right I think exactly So that's why it's
5:56:17
not about you feel like it's about I know it's objectively not true because you made the differential yourself
5:56:23
There's a difference between a dildo and a penis Of course there is So if there's an attachment distinction if you have
5:56:30
that same attachment homosexual meaning same sex you suck on the penis of the
5:56:36
same sex how is that not gay I don't think there's a Because gay just means
5:56:42
you're having sex with someone of the same sex Got it However wait no no no
5:56:49
What does gay mean that you're having sex with someone of the same sex And if you're having sex with someone in this
5:56:56
case who you call your on who you call your girlfriend and has a penis they are
5:57:02
the same No Because if that girlfriend with the penis decided to that she wanted to be a
5:57:09
he or a they it's not about the sex it's about the orientation
5:57:16
of the person I have a full vagina biologically But if I presented as male
5:57:22
and I said I'm a male and my partner respects me as a male and uses he him
5:57:28
pronouns that makes me a male You said gay is somebody who engages in sex with
5:57:37
somebody of the same sex That's right If you engage with sex with some um with a
5:57:44
person who's a male who has a penis even if they present Hang on hang on Even if they present as a female by your own
5:57:51
logical criteria they would have to be gay I want to put it this way I think
5:57:57
that your questions are reserved for a specific subset of people who simply
5:58:03
don't get it and never will And that's just fine with me because those who do But you do realize that like logic has
5:58:10
to be consistent or so logical I feel like the human logic has to be experience is not quantifiable
5:58:16
calcul Go ahead No I have a a question about like the the words that you use So
5:58:24
you're saying is it gay Is it gay Is it gay What no no wait Don't lie I asked
5:58:30
her what gay means didn't I Well yes And what did she say I don't think anybody can hang on What did she say She said
5:58:37
that it's having sex with someone of the same sex So it's not me Hang on So then before you get into whatever you're
5:58:43
about to get into Okay I actually asked what her criteria for gay was and used
5:58:49
that didn't I Hang on Didn't I use actually what her criteria for gay was
5:58:56
So can I Hang on Hang on Didn't I Yes Okay Now go ahead
5:59:01
What if we instead of using the word gay used the word queer Okay When queer means what Quee means like having sex
5:59:09
with people of either the same gender or a different gender than you but it's
5:59:15
still not like what makes you queer though
5:59:20
In that instance the gender part of it would make it not specifically gay or straight So if I were having sex with a
5:59:27
biological female as a biological male but she identified as being a male and I
5:59:34
identified as being a female we changed nothing We changed no phenotypical Hang on We hang on Stop We So then all that
5:59:41
makes it queer is that we self ID that we're queer That's right Cuz who cares about what you think or what you think
5:59:47
or what you think So then how does that word have meaning It doesn't It does It doesn't Exactly That's right Perfect
5:59:54
What do you think about this argument Andrew If if when uh women who were
5:59:59
lesbians told us we were lesbians we actually said "Yeah what makes Brian not a lesbian?" Actually he doesn't have a
6:00:06
vagina or identify with a vagina That's crazy Are you a woman Do you
6:00:12
consider yourself about his identity that yet I
6:00:17
just got to ask if Brian flopped out his penis and said it's a vagina and a woman
6:00:23
sucked it is he a lesbian Then if he identifies as a Are you guys able to scoot over If he identifies this way
6:00:31
just a tad Yeah Sorry Go ahead So Brian identifies as a lesbian He whips out his penis A woman sucks it right Mhm He's a
6:00:38
lesbian Is he I mean if he wants to say he is it's up to him and the woman is doing it He might be ridiculous but then
6:00:46
what are we pointing to here with these words They're empty labels Like me I'm Andrew I You guys all know that I'm
6:00:52
Andrew What makes me Andrew though What makes me an Andrew If there was another guy sitting here like let's say Brian's
6:00:59
name was Andrew There's two different Andrews right The label is empty then It
6:01:04
doesn't point at anything It's just a label that says I'm Andrew But if I wanted to give a descriptor for
6:01:11
something like heterosexual homosexual I'd have to be pointing towards some behavior activity something right
6:01:19
Something I'd have to be pointing to So what am I pointing to If the question is
6:01:25
labels I I can't speak for any other No it's not just labels It's it's
6:01:30
definitionally If Brian says he's a lesbian what makes him a liar
6:01:37
It's that he doesn't have the follow through of actually showing that that that's what he's interested in What does
6:01:43
that mean That doesn't mean anything He's not dressed like a woman He's not presenting So only So you can only be
6:01:49
that gender on that identity So you can only be that gender if you present that way Nope If you
6:01:55
contradiction we can move on Are there transgender people in China Yes Yes Oh
6:02:01
yeah Is it accepted though Yes Not widely Not widely Okay It's providential
6:02:07
right Like secretly Yeah Um I guess so But there is a famous uh dancer as well
6:02:14
as a comedian and talk show comedian who is like trans like she Okay But is also
6:02:22
hated right Okay So that makes sense Yeah You wouldn't want
6:02:28
your family to You said a man dating a transgender woman is straight Why do you think that is It is all a matter of
6:02:35
definition Like if you say it's transgender woman you already define it like define her as a woman Then
6:02:42
automatically like that person would be straight right She's right It's just trivially true So if you define it as
6:02:49
such it would just be trivially true but it doesn't point at what we're trying to point at So she's right Like it it would
6:02:56
just be trivially true If you said a woman is anybody who identifies as a woman I identify as a woman Then it's
6:03:02
trivially true that I'm a woman right But it doesn't point at anything right
6:03:07
We're not pointing What's pointing I because I understand what you're saying
6:03:13
people who have that mindset because anytime we make a definition of anything we want to point to the thing we're
6:03:20
pointing to right Why does any human feel like they need to define or point towards any other human sexuality or
6:03:27
communication if we didn't have definitions for what we're trying to communicate Well that needs to change No it doesn't If I'm smoking a cigarette
6:03:33
and everybody knows what cigarette means and you're trying to convey the information that I'm smoking a cigarette
6:03:39
but I'm actually chewing gum Does it make sense that you say cigarette for gum if nobody understands what you're
6:03:44
saying Unless you're chewing nicotine gum Yeah But they see what I mean like you just made my point clear It's that
6:03:51
the reason that in this circumstance of the example you were giving before with
6:03:56
the son and the transgender girlfriend it's that you wouldn't specifically say is it gay because the person No but he
6:04:04
does say that He does ask that what so I would say queer So what is a woman A
6:04:10
woman I mean oh my gosh I have to get into it Like a woman basically
6:04:16
is usually a person who is born with a vagina and the genitalia of what we
6:04:23
typically would know as a woman Usually is doing a lot of heavy lifting there Usually you see it's doing a lot of
6:04:30
because I know that there's people who Yeah So So what is a so what is a woman like when we point to a definition we
6:04:36
don't say usually right because otherwise the definition doesn't mean anything
6:04:43
right Like if I said if I said a camera is usually a a component base that a camera
What is a woman?
6:04:50
had but also an electrical board had I'm not pointing at anything So what is a woman A woman is someone who has a
6:04:58
vagina Born with a vagina Yeah I can I ask a clarifying question on that So uh
6:05:04
you're familiar with the term neo vagina Actually I'm not Okay So you know but
6:05:09
she said born with Oh is that something like you did she say born I thought I
6:05:14
thought she was wi a woman with a vag uh with a Can you repeat it one more time I would say yeah a woman with born with a
6:05:21
vagina Oh okay Fair enough What's a woman Anyone who presents or identifies
6:05:26
as a woman Your definition has a vagina
6:05:32
Same Has a vagina Wait just to be clear uh transgender women can get a surgery
6:05:39
that gives them what they would call a vagina So just want to clarify
6:05:46
biological but they would be a woman a transgender woman And I just because I want to because I don't
6:05:54
consider uh the transgender surgery what they do the bottom surgery that's
6:06:00
not a vagina So I just want to be really precise in our uh our language here Are
6:06:06
you saying a woman born like born female at with a vagina or a woman who's born
6:06:13
with a vagina and then a transgender who goes through the surgery is transgender woman I what other people want to call
6:06:19
themselves and do I Yeah that's up to you to label Okay So are you agreeing with her I'm agreeing with the same Okay
6:06:25
So transgender woman is a woman I don't see a distinction between the two but they're both women Okay Um what is a
6:06:32
woman A woman is someone who either presents themsself as a woman or goes through the process to be able to
6:06:38
present themselves as a woman because there's a different difference between sex and gender Okay And what what is a
6:06:44
woman Like a woman is a person with a vagina but like I know people are
6:06:50
sometimes born with not with no complete vagina like interex
6:06:56
interex interex like they have both like they can be herm they they would call those chamir or hemaphrodites
6:07:03
I'm not sure about those case but there are cases that like their genes are like
6:07:09
uh xxy no but I xxx but however they're sure they're still males
6:07:16
No they are females As x ask x xx is male xy is I'm sorry xy is male xx is
6:07:22
female But you can't have xxy Yeah Right And things like this where you're still
6:07:29
the opposite sex Yes But I'm not talking about that What is a woman Just define it
6:07:36
Um a w a woman is a person with a a complete vagina or like they have um
6:07:44
problems with with their vagina but they like they were raised up like as a
6:07:51
social female Okay So you're talking like a birth defect Yeah Okay Sure Um what about
6:08:00
transgender women Are they women Um like do they still have a penis But
6:08:07
I'm a bit confused because you said born you said born with a vagina No I say
6:08:12
said with a vagina I think Yes Mhm Oh you said they a woman is someone with a
6:08:18
vagina not born with a vagina Right Okay So that would include trans At least in
6:08:23
your view that would include transgender women Do they still have dicks Yeah they got they cover Sure Let's say they they
6:08:29
get rid of the penis Yeah Then it's okay Okay Okay then it's one Okay cut one uh one followup on that Um can a male
6:08:37
become a female Well okay They can do whatever they please
6:08:43
and identify with but personally I just And hold on hold on So I'm asking you a
6:08:49
question Yes So there's gender become a woman No no no There's gender and sex So
6:08:55
I'm talking gender Can a man can become a woman I think some of you are going to
6:09:01
say yes If we're talking about sex can a male become a female
6:09:07
If it's not about gender no Okay Can a male become a female I don't think I get the question Can you
6:09:13
scoot your mic that way I think I do So the separation between sex and gender Gender is your expression of how you
6:09:19
identify Sex is your actual like physical body Yes Can a male actually become a
6:09:27
female Quick answers if you can guys Yes If there are hermaphrodite and you have
6:09:32
both inside of you I'm speaking in generalities here I'm not talking I'm not looking for like the I'm even willing to accept I'm actually willing
6:09:39
to accept the specifics So if you think a mafrodite can become the other sex I think that that's fine Yeah Okay But can
6:09:46
a but I don't think we got really definitive there Can a male become a female So yeah So if he was like presenting but he has ovaries Okay Right
6:09:55
Yeah But that's okay But like how about there aren't birth
6:10:00
defects Like an otherwise normal healthy male can they become a female He can't
6:10:06
have he can become a woman but female with ovaries if you're looking at biological What about you No no
6:10:16
not completely the same as Okay I just want to point out uh you are all of you
6:10:22
who said uh a woman is this that you're all biology excuse me you're all science
6:10:28
deniers All of you are science deniers Biology is a hard science It's not a soft
6:10:36
science like psychology and sociology and economics Hard sciences like biology
6:10:43
for example with established facts It's not up for negotiation It's not up for
6:10:48
debate Sure Just to be clear who's I think that depends So for me I would ask
6:10:55
this Why do you specifically you as a heterero married happily as you
6:11:02
mentioned man Why do you care Well I'll dive into it and I'll show you why
6:11:08
Actually this is a I'm sorry I'm I know I was having a conversation You couldn't
6:11:13
help but in Go ahead I feel like I kind of understand why But anyway so back to this conversation over here I can't
6:11:19
believe that you just bought it in while we were having the discussion but you couldn't help yourself But here's the
6:11:25
thing I think that that's a fair question and I'll explain my position but let's start with this I want to show
6:11:31
you something that's super important Okay in philosophy we call this an infinite regress An infinite regress
6:11:39
would be if I ask you in this case for like a definition and you give me the
6:11:46
thing at that I'm asking about as the definition it infinitely regresses and
6:11:52
I'm going to show you how this works in real time So I asked you what is a woman and you said a woman's anybody who
6:11:57
identifies as a woman That seems fair right Okay Is she a woman to me looking at her
6:12:06
sitting here Yes Am I a woman No because you definitely don't present and have stated that you are not That seems that
6:12:13
seems fair that there's distinctions between the two of us So if I ask the criteria
6:12:20
again what differentiates me from her If you say a woman's anyone
6:12:28
who identifies as a woman okay I'm a woman All right What differentiates us
6:12:34
now Well despite the fact you became a woman 5 seconds ago but I am now
6:12:40
physically What What differentiates us The physical characteristics of being
6:12:46
female at this point in your transition ma'am That's a big difference And so and
6:12:53
and and what are those what are those differences Um I don't see boobs I don't
6:12:58
think there's a vagina present Then it sounds to me like when you say woman you actually don't mean anybody who says
6:13:05
woman cuz that doesn't give you enough information It sounds like you mean there has to be other criteria there
6:13:12
Otherwise how could you Yeah Otherwise how could you make the distinction Because you you would tell me like you
6:13:18
just did You'd say "Guidance I'm a woman." And from there on out I would receive Yeah But but why is it that you
6:13:23
would instantly see her as a woman and not instantly see me as one But the the
6:13:29
same reason why you would look at me and say African-American and not Latino That makes sense So if I were to say like
6:13:36
black definitionally I might point to like skin I might point to hair I might point to all sorts of physical
6:13:42
differentials right I would not say anybody who identifies as black would I Nope Why Because you can't really and
6:13:50
truly choose that race is different than sex Yeah Yeah But hang on hang on hang
6:13:55
on hang on I'm not saying they're the same I'm just asking you this I'm just asking you this one question What would
6:14:03
make me not black You're not You don't You're not So if you gave a
6:14:08
definition of black versus white you would be pointing to criteria which made a differential between black and white
6:14:15
But how is it that you can look at me and say how is it that you can look at me and say man look at her and say say
6:14:21
woman because you are But the second I say but I identify as a woman Suddenly those distinctions go away That's an
6:14:27
infinite regress What that means is what is a woman A woman's anyone who says they're a woman Yeah but what is that
6:14:33
though Well anyone who says they're that thing But what is that Anyone who says they're that But what is it though It's
6:14:41
anyone who says they're it right I don't think the people there's no one asking that question Yeah but that's what they
6:14:46
are asking I that is what they're asking And so the thing is that's what y'all are asking is what it is what we all are
6:14:54
asking on that spectrum but it's super but no I know you don't care but it's super important to us men who are not
The importance of DEFINITIONS
6:15:00
happy with the state of males super important to us because to who's us yeah so the to the people who don't believe
6:15:06
in the ideology there you go I think that of wait a second anybody can just
6:15:12
identify as anything become that thing you say no they can't but when I say what's a woman you say anybody who
6:15:18
identifies as a woman I say well what distinguishes me from her this this this this this and then I say "Okay so what
6:15:25
is a woman?" Well anybody who identifies as a woman you're not pointing at anything You have an empty label It
6:15:32
points to nothing I think because that's an Listen I I want I want I want to explain this so that you know it It's a
6:15:38
logical It's It's actually logically facious It's called an infinite regress
6:15:44
fallacy What you're doing is you're infinitely regressing So you're just always saying the same thing but never
6:15:51
pointing to anything So if I were to tell you if I were to ask you what's a guitar and you said anything I point to
6:15:57
and say it's a guitar Have you told me what a guitar is No But I think most people when you say
6:16:03
guitar they form an image of a guitar in their mind So if you just say I mean you
6:16:09
know hey if you want to play a drum as a guitar you can do that But I think we're I totally agree with this You're
6:16:15
removing the human experience from all that It's only the human experience which can identify what is a guitar Who
6:16:22
can make a guitar besides a human Oh I don't know Nobody Nothing can make a guitar but a human as far as we know So
6:16:29
if that's the case when I say what is a guitar and you say anything I point to and say it's a guitar you say that tells
6:16:36
me nothing I agree you would if I asked you this question and just describe it
6:16:42
for me What is a guitar an instrument with strings What does it
6:16:47
look like That's There's so many shapes of guitars Yeah But what do they generally at least
6:16:54
look like Long stick strings and a bottom part I don't even know what you call So based on that I can at least say
Why TRUTH matters
6:17:01
that I can rule out everything without strings as an instrument as not being a guitar Right Sure Now we're getting Now
6:17:08
we're getting to what a definition is Right Sure And that's the distinction between an empty label and a definition
6:17:14
When you say that's a guitar at least I can point to what that is When you say anything I point to is a guitar that
6:17:21
tells me [ __ ] nothing about what a guitar is So are we so simpleminded in 2025 If we don't have a distinct
6:17:29
description for a person their sexuality their preferences if we can't define it
6:17:35
it's not right If we can't def Oh no No I listened to you for a long time Go ahead If we can't define it it's wrong
6:17:41
If we can't define it it's confusing If we can't define it it's not scientific There are a lot of things in science and
6:17:47
biology and history and art that are undefinable You cannot define a person
6:17:54
And honestly just blatantly speaking people like you do not have a seat at the table because it's not for you We're
6:18:00
the only ones who have the seat at the table That that table is just for y'all But I would think that I know that the
6:18:08
people who are on the rainbow spectrum we don't care Yeah But but y'all do And
6:18:14
it's interesting because I feel all I hear behind it to me is we don't understand y'all So we feel threatened
6:18:20
by that Why What are you threatened by by Does my fake penis really de do
6:18:27
something that big to the male ego Does that Does my strap really do that You do understand I guess it does do understand
6:18:34
us It sounds to me like you're saying you do understand us and we feel threatened by that So well it has it has
6:18:41
to be the case It has to be the case Define us Why do you have to define us Well here's the thing It has to be the case All Yeah logic You can't beat logic
6:18:49
You can't put logic to love in human experience You can't put logic unquantifiable right Logic is the one
6:18:55
thing you can't ever refuse Is love logical Have you experienced love Actually love is logical Yes Or is it
6:19:02
emot It it can be and it's not It is logical No we we just we just ran the
6:19:07
experiment It is logical No no no We just ran the experiment in front of everyone here based on swipes There's no
6:19:15
logic in a swipe You get a five six second oh I like that I don't like that
6:19:20
I like what I see I don't like what I see And then you get into the deeper Hang on Let me respond Let me respond
6:19:25
Let me respond Actually there is Not only is there a logic to it but the whole reason we're having the discussion
6:19:31
is about the logic of it Just because if if you say um well what happens Andrew
6:19:38
is that there's an influx of emotion which uh based on these emotions humans
6:19:44
have interactive experiences where they swipe left swipe right blah blah blah Well that's within the compliance of
6:19:49
logic There's abs absolutely nothing illogical about that saying I have emotions therefore I act on emotions
6:19:56
logically follows There is nothing illogical about that There is however
6:20:01
something highly illogical about giving an empty label to a definition of a
6:20:08
thing you're trying to describe That's completely illogical I don't think the label can't I mean I don't history of it
6:20:15
We're not talking about labels We're talking about defining a thing so that it can be even understood At the end of
6:20:22
the day I don't care what the person I who the person I'm interact with
6:20:27
whatever their label or definition for themsself is that's great for them So would it be fair to say you don't care
6:20:34
about logic I don't care about descriptors and which would be logic So
6:20:39
can you even have logical interactions without descriptors Heck yeah How And if you can't then that is there a single
6:20:45
thing that you can logically express without a descriptor All words are descriptors Yeah
6:20:52
Aren't all words descriptors Yeah But how do you describe feelings With words Yeah Exactly So all words are
6:20:58
descriptors When you say feelings you're describing I don't think we I think our disconnect is I'm not disagreeing with
6:21:05
you as far as there are labels There are definitions There are words to describe
6:21:11
people There are scientific terms and things to describe genitalia None of that's false 1,000%
6:21:19
with you I think my personal standpoint on that is none of that matters to those
6:21:26
that it doesn't matter to But to those that it does that's great It's there If you want to quantify
6:21:32
that information and use it in your dating experience like by all means But for me as a person the first thing I'm
6:21:40
asking or looking for when I swipe left or right or talk to a person is not is
6:21:45
your vagina certain biological This doesn't But this doesn't answer the question Like how come I'm not black I
6:21:52
don't I don't know You'd have to ask your mom that You don't You don't know why I'm not black You don't know I just
6:21:58
want you to look me in the eyes and say "I don't know why you're not black." Like surgery to I just want to make sure
6:22:04
as black either I know Yes you can American Yes you can do that And did
6:22:11
Michael Jackson get surgery Yeah Became white I think Yeah But did he get surgery also Yes And so the thing is is
6:22:18
like if I could get surgery that would make my skin look like your skin Am I
6:22:24
black That depends Do I care No I mean I that is my is my question about whether
6:22:31
you care or if I am black It kind of is cuz if you ask the person who really debated that kind of thing with people
6:22:36
and that kind of stuff mattered Of course they'd have an opinion and they'd have an answer So you have no opinion on
6:22:42
if if I bleached or in some way changed my skin to be black Would I be black
6:22:49
Your experience of blackness Mhm authentic or not biological or not is
6:22:54
yours My authentic experience of blackness is mine Your experience as a
6:23:01
newly would I be black or not That's not up to me No that it just doesn't answer
6:23:06
any You just don't answer question This is the biggest problem with this whole ideology right Is like you can't answer
6:23:13
a single question You go I'm not even you just go like this You just go like this You just go maybe And it's like it
6:23:21
tells us nothing about anything It just literally because we don't care I think it's only our age group and up that's
6:23:28
really there's no nothing to get in the market There's nothing to get What I'm
6:23:33
saying is objectively true and what she's saying is objectively nothing So when you're saying if you suddenly got a
6:23:41
surgery and became black tomorrow would you be considered black by everybody And
6:23:46
the thing No that's not what I'm asking Would you be seen as black Nope That's not what I'm asking either
6:23:53
Would he be So like if we're relating it back to gender and what am I asking Start start with this before you straw
6:23:59
man the entire position and [ __ ] it all up What am I What am I asking Started
6:24:04
with gender didn't we Stopend stop sping and just answer my question What am I actually asking And then I'll tell you
6:24:11
if it's wrong what I'm actually asking Would you be considered or seen as black
6:24:17
He's asking is black I'm not asking about perception I'm not asking about
6:24:23
any of that I'm asking would I be So let me ask you this again That's why
6:24:29
I don't allow people to straw man my position with [ __ ] If I were to
6:24:34
somehow go through and get all of my skin reconstructed to look exactly like
6:24:39
hers would I actually be black or not In my opinion no Okay Thank you That's why
6:24:46
I don't That's right Back to gender That's it No No That's it Okay The whole debate right now what you just did was
6:24:53
you demonstrated how illogical the entire position is of saying "But if I
6:24:58
presented as a woman you would be." That's [ __ ] absurd by your own logic Now if you're dating how would we know
6:25:05
that you're not biologically blend I want to go off of your point with with
6:25:11
that statement in regards to gender and kind of mapping it on to each other If you decided tomorrow to become a woman
6:25:19
and you didn't have the experiences of a lifetime of being a woman I like no man does Yeah I as a cisgender woman So then
6:25:26
no man could become a woman I'm going with your point here that I would be upset So then no man can become a woman
6:25:32
can they It's for me now Yeah No Exactly All
6:25:38
right I'm good I'm going to go off a smoke And I feel like the whole argument kind of takes away from cisgender women
6:25:46
kind of rallying together almost for a certain type of feminism Hold on Well
6:25:52
you asked why this matters Yeah Why this matters I'd like to give you three reasons And you might not agree with uh
6:25:59
the gravitas of why they this would be important but can I ask also who why
6:26:05
does it matter and who does it matter to it may be part of your answer but I think that's important yeah so I think
6:26:10
uh the first one I'll give you will matter to everybody okay and that's the truth
6:26:16
that that is the reason the truth is the so the that would matter to everyone and that's the first reason I would give you
6:26:22
as to why it matters truth
6:26:28
So are are we speaking in terms of like you're I'm speaking about the truth I'm speaking of the truth not your truth not
6:26:34
my truth The truth The truth of the matter in terms of dating though right Or we just talking about generally
6:26:40
speaking I'm speaking about that males can't become female Males
6:26:47
like that's biologically Well I'm not even Look I don't think you
6:26:54
can I'm willing to grant that within the ideology I guess it's accept you can
6:27:01
change your gender but I I link gender
6:27:06
and it's it's irreovable from sex in my worldview Sure So in my worldview a man
6:27:13
can't become a woman And a transgender woman is a transgender woman Mhm But
6:27:19
she's not a woman Sure Because to me in my my worldview woman is linked to sex
6:27:26
and it's it's ir removable I don't think any of us disagree with that Now the second thing is is that I'll since it's
6:27:32
a dating podcast I'll relate it to dating Uh I think that uh one transgender women
6:27:39
have a duty to disclose to potential romantic partners Agreed Yeah Because
6:27:44
one I think it would be good for their own safety Yes So if you're a transgender woman and you're trying to date a I don't I don't like this term a
6:27:51
cis man uh for your own safety you should disclose beforehand so that they
6:27:57
can choose whether perhaps for them they don't want to date a transgender woman for their own safety I think they should
6:28:03
disclose But if we start getting into too deep into uh well transgender women
6:28:09
are women and this is non-negotiable then it's like okay well what is the do regular women have to disclose to men By
6:28:16
the way I'm not a transgender woman So we get into this kind of murky territory
6:28:21
where uh there's less of a duty for transgender women to disclose They might
6:28:27
even feel like no it's actually perfectly acceptable for me to essentially trick men into sleeping with
6:28:34
me right Uh so I think they have a duty to disclose And then also related to
6:28:40
dating what of if I as a man don't want to date a transgender woman am I if if
6:28:47
the narratives allow to fully manifest it manifest themselves as it relates to
6:28:53
this ideology what kind of social repercussions are there when I have a
6:28:59
preference towards not dating transgender women but if on a long enough timeline it becomes determined
6:29:06
like if if the greater Right now there's a massive culture war related to this issue But let's say I'm
6:29:13
in the minority one day you know and maybe the the leftists the LGBTQ
6:29:19
activists they win on the culture war And 90% of people are like "That's a transgender woman." And you can't ask
6:29:25
them if they're transgender And if you don't sleep with them you're a bigot And what do bigots deserve Bigots deserve
6:29:31
violence Bigots deserve to lose their jobs Bigots deserve not in bigots
6:29:37
deserve all kinds of repercussions both social and sometimes when it comes to violence Isn't that what transgender
6:29:44
people have been getting for tens I'll go ahead and grant so turned and now we're upset Well hold on I don't think I
6:29:51
don't want violence either Right Violence either way I don't think that's fair But I don't think people should be
6:29:56
subject to violence for their dating preferences But I could see some sort of scenario in
6:30:02
the future where if somebody does have a stated preference of not wanting to date somebody who's transgender if that is
6:30:09
bigotry if we're using that metric as big bigotry people are happy to enact
6:30:14
violence to aren't on a slippery slope against bigotry And then and then so
6:30:19
that's the second thing Hang on before you get into this I want to bid the
6:30:24
whatever podcast a do wait Andrew brought in Hang on I Hang on I

6:31:41
tomorrow Andrew See Brian [ __ ] see Brian
6:31:46
Brian Just scoot it down one chair All right Um so I was I was saying uh the
6:31:53
third point the third point on this is laws And I'll just ask a simple question on this then we'll move on to a
6:31:58
different topic So the first is truth The second is like dating since dating podcast Uh do you think that we should
6:32:05
criminalize uh say if if you were a dictator like do
6:32:11
you think misgendering for example uh intentional intentional so somebody refuses to
6:32:17
acknowledge so somebody's pronouns it's a transgender woman and she my pronouns are I want to be referred to her as a
6:32:24
she or a her but somebody ide excuse me
6:32:29
ideologically differs from her you and thinks that's not a woman that's
6:32:36
a man and refuses to use the pronouns and says you're a he you're a
6:32:41
him Do you think that this should face uh if used in certain circumstances should face criminal punishment or some
6:32:48
sort of punishment Not necessarily I guess I mean it's hate
6:32:54
I mean I don't know that it's hate How's it hate Okay You're you're like you're saying they're
6:33:00
purposely not using the correct pronouns or they did on accident intentionally
6:33:05
not using the correct pronouns but not in a not in a rude way You might say it's rude on the surface already but not
6:33:13
like like not in a mocking or condescending way but like in the same way that they would say it's a she says
6:33:22
he you're this person's like are you uh over this person in a place of hierarch like you're their boss and this person
6:33:28
is it could be any scenario but they're not they're not like like intent when I
6:33:34
say intentional they're not intentionally being condescending or rude about it They're just like "This is
6:33:39
what I believe." I'm not saying it in like a snarky way It's just like "Felicity uh that's a she." But if she
6:33:48
thinks she's a he I'm just I'm not like "Oh she's she's
6:33:53
great." If that makes sense If you're her boss I think then you have an obligation to your employee to use the
6:34:01
pronouns that they are choosing if you're her friend or something I mean she can't really do anything or have any
6:34:07
bad if you're the dictator If you were the dictator right So that's that's already in itself a problem But okay
6:34:14
Would you would you pass a law criminalizing intentional misgendering
6:34:20
Depends on who we the law is for Bosses and CEOs and people of power Sure I mean
6:34:25
they haven't Okay But like me and you if I called you a he I mean I hope you wouldn't care in the No criminalizing on
6:34:33
this one For me no criminalizing The mean streets of Santa Barbara Oh yeah Oh god Brutal Brutal It's crazy out here
6:34:40
It's wild out here Incriminization can be like a fine or you talk about like jail time Well what
6:34:47
Let's start with just a fine It's a $500 fine to misgender
6:34:52
No I misgender people by Well I guess mistakes Yeah there's mistakes and stuff I say no Clearly intentional So here
6:34:59
would be the example The person says "Here are my pronouns." And the person
6:35:04
refuses to use them and says "He uh you know he instead of she." Yeah No criminalizing in intentionally Should
6:35:11
that be uh criminalized Should there be a fine No No Me and you standing on the balcony I
6:35:18
tell you I'm a he You continue to call me a she No fine me and you sitting right here on this podcast live and I
6:35:25
have said to this group I identify as a he him and you continue to call me she
6:35:31
her you're getting sued That's all it is to it Oh yeah But that's different and that's different than like criminalizing
6:35:37
Then it's like you're in liel slander Yeah You're civil Well that wouldn't be liel or slay No it would be what would
6:35:43
it be Uh but yeah but essentially that's a civil case right So are you in favor of civil penalties for that's on the
6:35:50
individual in that situation like cuz it's a whole thing with IDs and passports now like do they have to have
6:35:56
it legally put on their stuff that they are that gender or are they cuz that's
6:36:02
if it's legal and there's legal ramifications then you could just change it back like tomorrow Is sex on our like
6:36:10
why at this point is sex even on our IDs and stuff We don't But should it be should there be like a fine for
6:36:16
misgendering I don't think you could bring it into law because like I was saying there's
6:36:23
stuff with IDs and it like people don't automatically just change those legal documents
6:36:29
Okay Yeah It's murky but I think that there should be you can't get a fine for name calling Huh What do you think So no
6:36:36
I don't think there should be What do you think No fine Well what about this Uh high school students
6:36:43
Uh so they're classmates right That would be a new context Uh should there be like um maybe a detention for a
6:36:50
misgendering intentional misgendering or should there be maybe a if they they repeat it three times should there be a
6:36:56
suspension No I think it depends on that person knows that they're causing harm So it's not even about the misgendering
6:37:02
it's about that you're intentionally trying to cause someone harm So there should be a repercussion if you're
6:37:07
especially if you're in school Yeah Could you would just make the reverse argument that by them using like if if
6:37:14
it's just totally separate maybe they're religious you would be causing the individual harm because they're causing
6:37:20
themsel harm by lying If they think it's lying if they don't think it's the truth
6:37:25
then you're inflicting harm on them It does no harm for you to say he she
6:37:31
they or them to a person It just I think then we're playing the victim There's that um playing the victim against lying
6:37:37
and people are against lying You can justify a lot of crazy [ __ ] if you go into other people's business and go you
6:37:44
said this thing and I'm offended by it which is what we don't like I'm offended by everything You said this You're
6:37:50
making me do this So yeah no fines [ __ ] it Uh okay But um intentional harm is
6:37:58
intentional harm Like she said if you know that a person has stated to you
6:38:04
legally otherwise I identify as such what harm whether you believe it or not
6:38:09
it doesn't matter If they want to sit there and be a potato let them be a potato You're not eating the potato You
6:38:15
acknowledging that that person feels that way about themselves does nothing
6:38:20
to you at the end of the day It just does Usually if you don't like something you just get away from them If someone's an a-hole you should just get away from
6:38:26
them If someone's misgendering on purpose just get away from them on their pizza You're not going to So
6:38:31
there's probably scenarios where just for like the like simplicity sake some people are really hardline with this
6:38:38
Like if I'm just not interested like in like a particular case offending
6:38:43
somebody or I'm just not like it doesn't there's situations where I just don't care Doesn't matter I'd probably like go
6:38:51
along with it just because like to avoid the situation There's probably situations where like if you're a
6:38:56
student uh in college and your professor is transgender like that's probably like
6:39:01
you're probably going to have to bite the bullet just for the sake of getting a good grade in the class even if it's against your thought process But like
6:39:08
I'm speaking you know outside of these uh outside of these specific instances
6:39:15
there are situations where or not rather not situations but if we're having a
6:39:20
conversation about the issue itself and we're actually it well is it a woman I
6:39:25
that's what we're talking about here We're we're talking about the truth
6:39:31
Whose truth Yours or that person I get what you're saying saying there to a certain degree like we all have to
6:39:38
live in the same society and we all do to a certain point have to agree on what is the truth Yeah I don't think it's any
6:39:45
different than what like she had mentioned earlier If it's something you're just not in agreement with or it's a situation that makes you uncomfortable get out of it Now if it's
6:39:52
like a work school situation you guys you got to learn to to figure it out Do I think it should be criminalized
6:39:57
Probably not What Brian's argument is is that in the war going on between our
6:40:05
society of people who are in agreement and disagreement let's say he's saying someone's in school let's say you have a
6:40:11
super liberal principle and so they're like taking the side of the student
6:40:17
who's trans or using like different pronouns than they normally would So of course like you're
6:40:24
at a super liberal school maybe they're siding with that student Whereas if you go to a more conservative school they
6:40:30
might be telling the other student like "Hey you're going through some sort of like it depends on the the place you are
6:40:38
in society." And like that's that is an issue I see long term in society is that
6:40:44
we have these two opposing views and it is clashing And how do we come together
6:40:50
I'm betting that we're all human and our genitals do not matter At the end of the day why why do we even have I'm not
6:40:57
saying why do we have genders but why is it who cares Like if you put in your resume I shouldn't be worried about
6:41:03
whether you're male female or what you present You're a human being And I think when we come down to making those gender
6:41:09
distinctions that's why we're at war At the end of the day we're all just humans
6:41:14
It doesn't really we this is just us classifying each other like "Oh I'm not going to respect you because the
6:41:20
genitals you have don't match with your pronouns." At the end of the day they're they're a person Their experience
6:41:25
matters and that that's it It doesn't really matter what they have down there I mean it just doesn't Yeah what they
6:41:32
call it I would agree with that But I I feel like especially like in a maybe a school or work situation you're probably
6:41:38
going to talk to somebody more directly Hey can you do this for me not he I think that there's there's really only
6:41:44
particular situations and I think that's why he's asking if you're a dictator would you criminalize this in some for and I I think it almost it's a slippery
6:41:52
slope because then it comes down to belief some people truly believe that gender and sex are the same thing where
6:41:59
people see the opposite So how do you criminalize that and then then what's next then is it religion you know what I
6:42:05
mean So you'd have to criminalize ideology on that one Exactly And that's what people are scared because I think
6:42:11
people who have that mindset the they them the transgender people you know the non-binary it's becoming more and more
6:42:19
and more prevalent And the people who don't identify with that way of life are
6:42:24
in my opinion freaking out Like how do we navigate these LGBTQIA people Just
6:42:31
just respect and love them just the way you would a nonLGBTQIA person And if those
6:42:36
situations arise address them with empathy and love This person says "Yeah he they whatever I don't really agree
6:42:43
with it I'll call them that while I'm addressing them because that's how they feel." Well at the end of the day I'll
6:42:49
go home and still feel the same way Is you respecting that person going to
6:42:54
change your mindset Obviously not So why not just give them that respect and empathy while you're addressing them
6:43:01
Especially if you're in a professional setting At the end of the day they're just a human What they decide to call
6:43:07
themselves should not matter to you and what you do with your life It does matter to a certain group of people
6:43:14
though who are trying to maintain a certain order in society And are they
6:43:20
right Are they wrong Personally I'm not exactly sure But it does matter to them
6:43:27
because if these wars between the cultures continue on it's just going to
6:43:34
wreak havoc And I think part of while conservatives have their own issues I
6:43:40
think part of the issue that they're having with this is that they see these people as having a very severe mental
6:43:45
illness And while they can respect them as a person they can't respect the mental illness of it all So what do you
6:43:52
do if a person has an illness You disrespect this and if it is in fact I wouldn't say you disrespect them but
6:43:57
also you don't go blindly with their beliefs But if they're sick then you disrespecting or not respecting their
6:44:04
beliefs is not going to heal them They're still going to I was saying earlier you don't cause harm to people
6:44:10
on purpose However some people on the more conservative side would be saying
6:44:16
"Well they're causing me harm because they're being so mentally ill that it's
6:44:21
becoming almost a hassle on society." So do we sit there and say the same thing about obese people is they are for the
6:44:28
sake of time For the sake of time I've got to move it on We have uh one chat here from Lulu if this would work
Is it considered HARM?
6:44:36
actually work Thank you Lulu Lulu donated
6:44:41
$200 Trans sympathizers are basically willing to bend truth and logic for the sake of trans people's feelings Share
6:44:49
two Do you think that making choices based on feelings and emotions is wise for society
6:44:56
I do I believe that using your human instincts and
6:45:02
treating people with love and respect is how we are going to survive as a race not
6:45:08
by describing each other's genitals or using pronouns I I think at the end of
6:45:14
the day none of that will matter to the success of the human race is whether
6:45:19
you're they them trans or what I think that us as a people supporting and loving each other and having community
6:45:26
that's that's it All right Um I would hap I'd be more than happy to engage further in it but we've got a bit more
6:45:32
to get through so I'm gonna have to move it on Uh guys we've lowered the TTS We're uh
6:45:37
This is going to be the roast threshold So if you guys are like holding out for like the 30 or the $29 uh TTS's we're
6:45:44
just going to do $69 TTS and uh that'll be the roast session and then then we'll
6:45:49
wrap So uh don't hold out for the 30s because 69's the that's going to be the
6:45:54
end of it So uh let's see here There's Oh let's do uh you know that was kind of a heavy topic Let's do the AI stuff
6:46:00

6:49:34
I've done this before They did this me as a dude Whoops Sorry Lulu I'm going to change the threshold Not sure what why
6:49:40
that happened there One sec There's like five questions in one right now We're going to do boom
6:49:48
Sorry Lulu's mess Lulu donated $69 Share two Do you think trans people
6:49:54
should be allowed in women's sports What do you think about the girls or JK Rowlings that are against that Is there
6:50:02
validity to their qualms Quick answer on this if you can Um I'm
6:50:08
not too versed on the JK Rowling things other than like she's against or not like for trans people I would say I
6:50:15
dated a trans woman very recently and she was very biologically male like
6:50:20
muscles and all I would think that like a person with that type of body I
6:50:25
wouldn't put them in a women's sport Um I would maybe put them in a different
6:50:32
like maybe a sport for transgender women or have a league for just transgender women I think that's very circumstantial
6:50:39
though This person had like lots of muscles though So all right let's do gender swap Let's do this Oh yeah I love
6:50:46
this Ready I don't know By the way Matt I saw your chat Look the
6:50:53
thing is is that uh it's funny when you're anonymous sending in like insulting messages like making comments
6:50:59
about like people's weight or their race or whatever but like you if you're in a
TTS: Addressing criticisms
6:51:05
room with somebody that's completely unacceptable and inappropriate and uh look sometimes they slide through
6:51:11
accidentally And you can call me a simp if you want man But there's just like a certain degree of uh these are guests
6:51:18
here on the on the show And a lot of the a lot of the you
6:51:23
look there's very few other YouTube channels live streams where they would
6:51:31
ever allow through some of the chats that we do allow through And there's
6:51:36
just some that are just like just strictly insults Uh so sometimes they
6:51:41
get through but we're not going to like if you're just being up uh egregiously
6:51:47
insulting uh and you're not actually criticizing like anything that they're saying it's just an insult Like you can
6:51:54
attack their you can t you can attack their arguments you can attack their ideology but if if you're just in like
6:52:01
personal attacks that's really not going to fly Um and I I I don't know how else
6:52:07
to say it man I don't know how else how to say it You guys can call me Simps in the chat but it's just and it's just
6:52:14
it's not conducive to like the the topics that we talk about are already controversial to begin with and then
6:52:21
like we're going to throw on top of that we're just going to outright insult the guests That's never my goal Again we're
6:52:27
already having like uncomfortable conversations at it as it is I don't need the guests to feel further
6:52:34
discomfort just by by just getting straight up like insulted over
6:52:40
uh you know thing like race and stuff That's crazy guys That's that's crazy I'm not going to allow it If you don't
6:52:46
like that I don't know what to tell you Um and as far as the TTS it's already very late We'll be here way too long if
6:52:52
the roast is uh if the roast is lower So
6:52:58
um yeah cuz there's a ton more to get through So sometimes we don't always get to do a like a roast session at the
6:53:03
lower rate It is what it is It was a kind of a pretty uh hectic panel tonight
6:53:08
So that's integrity Thank you so much Cuz that's leadership right there That is
6:53:14
amazing Yeah No thank you You're setting bar I [ __ ] love that That shit's so sexy
6:53:20
It is Okay I kind of killed it
6:53:26
Hey Yeah Thank you Oh hey I I Andrew was dunking on me today so I'll take a comment Yeah
6:53:34
Um yeah like it's just um I don't know Uh and sometimes look sometimes some
6:53:39
comments get through and it's like nah that one's probably a little on the fence or uh it's just like guys you if
6:53:47
you enjoy the here here's the best way I could put it that I think people will be understanding of not wanting certain
6:53:54
chats to go through So if we want to get guests on the show like and somebody is
6:54:01
contemplating coming on the show who could be extremely entertaining for you and you'd want to hear either their
6:54:08
arguments or you'd want to hear them debate against me against Andrew against somebody else it is not in furtherance
6:54:16
and not conducive to securing guests for the show if somebody pulls up a stream
6:54:22
and it's just like super chat after super chat of just straight up like
6:54:27
racism and insults and all this stuff Uh so if you guys want me to put on a
6:54:34
good show like the actual content like the super chats are fun but the content of the shows the conversations and trust
6:54:41
me guys like the amount of people and the show's already walks the line like I said
6:54:47
uh there's plenty of people who we've had scheduled to be on the show or we've invited Well I'll start with people
6:54:54
who've been scheduled on the show the amount of people who flake asis just due
6:54:59
to the nature of the conversations but there's a component of like the super chats that makes people hesitant to come
6:55:05
on the show So there's that It's already difficult enough as it is guys to like
6:55:10
book guests to come on the show We're down to one show per week If if it's
6:55:15
really in terms of uh and I apologize for yapping here guys but uh I I feel
6:55:21
it's important to explain this to the audience Uh it we're already down to one show per
6:55:28
week due to guest uh well part of it's there's a couple reasons but one of it is difficulty with guest
6:55:35
booking The super chats are [ __ ] brutal People don't want to be associated with that They just don't um
6:55:42
they don't want to be associated with it And so um I'm very supportive and or I'm
6:55:47
very grateful for people who do support the show via super chat and whatnot but
6:55:52
I just I got to be considerate of the guests and I got to be considerate of my own platform to ensure that I can
6:55:59
continue to get guests for the show So it's anyways that's it So all right Just
6:56:06
wanted to explain that because I saw Matt's chat So um we have Christopher here There's a video where a guy asked
6:56:11
something like "If it's illegal for men to use steroids in bodybuilding competitions why isn't why isn't it
6:56:17
isn't Oh my god sorry I'm still drunk Uh why isn't it illegal for women to use makeup in beauty pageantss?" Thought
6:56:24
thoughts Quick answer on this from anybody That would be an awesome pageant
6:56:30
Nothing Yeah I think there should be two types
6:56:37
of That's a good point though Christopher Very very good point there Christopher
6:56:42
Yeah Okay So the next thing we're going to do here with the AI is uh gender swap We're going to gender We've gender swapped all of you So the question
6:56:49
you're going to ask yourself is would I date the male version of me Go ahead
6:56:54
pull it up Okay Oh interesting Wait I need to see it
6:57:00

7:02:06
have this Hold up Ang says Roar donated $69 Appreciate you man Do you think
7:02:13
transgender women or men fully intact should be allowed in women's locker/dressing rooms Do you think it's
7:02:20
fair to ask biological women to open space knowing some have been sid
7:02:28
do you think it's fair to ask biological women quick response on this if you can Knowing some have been
7:02:34
I think this is for you man If you um as far as the locker
7:02:40
rooms I'm going to say yeah I mean cuz for me like what what does it matter if
7:02:46
they're changing clothes next to you Like everyone changing clothes next to you isn't trying to have sex or with you
7:02:51
You know what I mean Like let let them change clothes and shower next to you It's not a big deal You don't have to be
7:02:56
in a relationship with them Yeah I don't think someone who's changing genders is really trying to jump your bones on Yeah
7:03:04
And either way like it's if someone wants to essay someone in a locker room they're going to do it whether or not
7:03:10
gender all genders Go there and do it Yeah Uh Moon in your notes here or while
7:03:15
in the questionnaire you agree with the following statement Women are just as
7:03:21
physically strong as men Can you just clarify You think some definitely I wouldn't say myself but yeah some women
7:03:28
definitely or more If in general would you agree that men are physically stronger than women I would say that men
7:03:34
have the biological makeup to be stronger than us But if a man doesn't work out and a
Women ARE as strong as men + dating in China
7:03:41
woman does she's going to be stronger Y'all are set up to be stronger Yes of course That's Yeah I agree I I agree
7:03:48
with you that there are certainly there are women who are stronger than some men Yep Perhaps many men even But if we
7:03:55
generally speaking men are physically stronger than women Generally
7:04:00
Most men Do Do you disagree You seem a little I can't tell Oh you were just kind of Maybe it's just how you It's the
7:04:07
It's the champagne Oh it's Of course the champagne What do they call champagne in
7:04:12
uh in China In Chinese Yeah Jung Champin Champin Like
7:04:22
champne Do they make champagne in
7:04:28
sparkling wine I guess Yeah Why would they not What the [ __ ] Right Um I feel
7:04:34
like we should talk about dating in China Oh do you have any thoughts on that Any All the dates that I had were
7:04:42
like marriage oriented So it's very Do people hook up in China to get sex Yeah like just you
7:04:50
know they go to a party they like I'm assuming there's you know nightclubs you go to a nightclub in China in in you
7:04:57
know wherever and people just yeah some people do that but such behavior is not
7:05:03
considered decent like you wouldn't want like all your classmates or your friends to know that unless you are all the same
7:05:09
kind of people I see Okay And well I feel like there's definitely people
7:05:16
definitely got the hookup in China Yeah cuz I mean there's a lot of people in China
7:05:22
What is it like It's 1.4 1.4 billion They're billion They're having sex in
7:05:27
China They have hookup culture They're they're having sex Um but like people have to get married first Yeah Yeah Yeah
7:05:34
And uh let's see here Um do you want to get married or have kids Yeah you do want kids Yeah Okay All right And uh do
7:05:42
you have I forgot to ask have a preference for when it comes to like will you would you date cuz you said you
7:05:47
dated uh another Chinese international student when you were in Germany and an
7:05:52
Indian guy Uh you have not dated a white person or black person No Or Latino
7:06:00
person No Like Mexican Not yet No Uh would you or do you have do you prefer to date uh Asian men
7:06:08
Um I I think I can date Latinos but like I I dance south bachatano like and like
7:06:16
I know a lot of Latinos and Latinas like like I have a a little bit issue with
7:06:23
like their punctualities and some people just don't respond to my messages at all
7:06:29
I mean it's just like certain people and then like would you would you date a a white guy Yeah Black guy I don't know I
7:06:37
think my parents would cry Like like literally my my grandma was crying when
7:06:43
she heard that I was dating an Indian guy and we wanted to live outside China
7:06:48
Like she was in her 90s Can I uh can I ask you a question Uh are people pretty
7:06:57
racist in China I think people are not aware of like this issue because there
7:07:04
are not enough foreigners Like people like who haven't been to the big cities have not seen any foreigner in their
7:07:11
whole life So people don't know whether they are actually racist or not But I
7:07:16
would say like because I dated this Indian guy So I like would notice a lot of comments uh in the internet They were
7:07:24
pretty like racist especially against like brown people or black people Got it
7:07:31
Okay Uh moving on to the questionnaire We won't probably won't do all of these but we'll just do a few more Um Shannon
7:07:38
you you did a squiggly line People of color can't be racist towards white people I don't think the word should be
7:07:44
to which you agree I put squiggly because I think the wording I don't
7:07:49
think that they can be racist but I think that they can prejudice Yeah you can be prejudice And then Gabby you also
7:07:55
circled that people of color can't be racist towards white people What's your position there Same thing You can be
7:08:01
prejudic but not racist Okay Uh can you explain it to me Racism
7:08:08
based it's more systematic when you really think about it because we had the civil rights movement for a reason We
7:08:14
were a Well I can't say we cuz I'm mixed I mean I don't know Okay Are you like
7:08:19
50/50 mix Yeah 50/50 But it was uh dad's black or mom's black Uh dad's black Got
Can you be racist towards white people? Sexist towards men?
7:08:26
it Okay Yeah But um it was a more or less of a thing that black people had to
7:08:32
fight for the rights as well of other people of colors And to this day there's
7:08:37
still ways that they're being oppressed And um the prison prison system is a
7:08:43
wave of that It really shows Um black people get incarcerated at higher rates
7:08:48
Um and you when you're in prison you work work for like five cents Wait one
7:08:54
one question on that So you said the related to the prison thing Mhm So you're saying there's a
7:09:01
disproportionality comparing whites to blacks In the prison like uh black people are
7:09:08
more likely to be convicted of incarcerated And you think is it would
7:09:13
you say that's because of racism Not inherently know because everyone
7:09:18
commits crimes but a part of it kind of is the whole prison system like the
7:09:24
working initially when it was started it was just a way to incarcerate black
7:09:29
people and have them do slave more slave work historically mainly in the south
7:09:34
yeah historically yes there was incentive today there's still like but they still work they still work in
7:09:40
prison for like peanut wages and well sometimes they get they get time off but
7:09:45
it's iffy But it's more or less like racism is a systematic oppression not
7:09:51
just a hate of their skin color Okay But question for you So you you're pointing towards there's a uh discrepancy in uh
7:10:00
convictions and incarceration between whites and blacks Uh but what if I told
7:10:05
you that discrepancy is orders of magnitude greater comparing men to women
7:10:11
So and you're pointing towards well uh the discrepancy between white and black
7:10:16
that's due to to racism right Well then surely following your own logic you
7:10:22
would have to say that the discrepancy between men and women in the prison system must be due to sexism No And
7:10:28
that's a different thing Black men are most of the time prosecuted because their skin color and sent like they get
7:10:35
charges against them But in there's other ways black women face racism
7:10:42
specifically Well white men are more incarcerated than black women That's a that's what I'm getting to There's it's
7:10:48
different a little bit for the genders within the black community But the thing is with black women it's also um they're
7:10:56
less likely to get proper treatment in hospitals and things like that There
7:11:01
there's a Yeah but let's stick to the prison thing Um Well okay Can you explain that Can
7:11:08
you uh reiterate Well so my question to you was uh you're pointing towards the
7:11:14
discrepancy between whites and blacks in prison Mhm As evidence of racism And I'm
7:11:20
telling you that there's an even greater discrepancy between men and women in prison So that too should then be
7:11:27
evidence that would be due to sexism Following your own logic No because
7:11:33
that's a whole different thing That's a gender breakdown not a race breakdown But if you're saying a discrepancy
7:11:40
exists right between the races yes between the races And you're saying this
7:11:45
discrepancy exists because racism So you would have to you'd have to
7:11:50
acknowledge that there is a discrepancy between uh men in the prison system and women in the prison There's far more men
7:11:57
that discrepancy is far greater between men and women than it is between black and white M so this must be due to
7:12:04
sexism right I'd say more or less because most men
7:12:11
commit more violent crimes and things like that There's a higher percentage of men committing violent crime You sure
7:12:16
you want to make this argument Uh yes I know But you're probably going to be right Hold on But if I were to present
7:12:22
to you evidence that uh if there were statistics that showed that black people
7:12:28
committed more crimes would that ex would that then explain away your claims that it's due to racism
7:12:35
uh for the discrepancy between white and black Depends on the crime I know it's not my
7:12:41
question but I think it depends on the crime a little bit Yeah But um I can't really defend that because
7:12:49
honestly um I did some research on this but not as much as I probably should
7:12:55
have which is kind of crappy but um I'd say that's more or less because of the
7:13:01
um just higher incarceration rate and also because of other things within the black community itself like gang
7:13:08
violence and things like that So I mean yes and no I I don't I do think that
7:13:13
there might be some sexism in there for sure I mean the we allow men to push down their emotions and they go bigger
7:13:20
right Women are doing more small crime and and small things You get the slap on the wrist So there's definitely both
7:13:25
cases You have sexism and racism going on for sure Yeah Well I mean if you look at uh sentencing disparities right So
7:13:33
there's there's some statistics that indicate uh and I' I'd actually have to do more research to say something
7:13:38
definitive uh that there's a sentencing disparity So the length of you know uh
7:13:44
the length of the sentence the prison sentence between whites and black there's disparity there Yeah But the
7:13:51
disparity again not just the incarceration rate but the disparity in terms of sentence length incarceration
7:13:57
length is again uh the the disparity between me uh men and women dwarfs the
7:14:03
disparity between white and black And so often times for example uh I mean look I
7:14:09
could give you anecdotes You guys could probably give me anecdotes in return Well perhaps it's not anecdotes but I
7:14:15
mean uh and I think this happened in Ventura Felicity so I don't know if you like you kind of live in that you're
7:14:22
like you live further down south Um there was this woman who was smoking
7:14:27
marijuana with her uh boyfriend or like h casual hookup or situationship and she
7:14:33
had like marijuana induced psychosis Yeah And then she stabbed him to death and also stabbed her dog
7:14:40
She he he died She got led off with probation
7:14:46
and community service Wow I would find it very unlikely if a man murdered a
7:14:53
woman Yeah Even if it was marijuana induced psychosis whatever
7:14:59
that is uh stabbed her to death that he would
7:15:04
get off Yeah He would not see the inside of a prison cell unless he's got a lot of money like a whole boatload Even then
7:15:13
he's fleeing the country per dog Oh yeah But I think that's two separate things like the sexism thing that's going on
7:15:19
where it's like yeah I agree Like it's like and I think a lot of us do where women can get away with certain things that men can't and then but then the
7:15:26
disparity of race of course is a separate Can I ask for some clarification Because isn't the question
7:15:31
white people can't experience racism So if something Yeah we can bring it back to that We got I'm just a little Well
7:15:37
I'm just a little confused asking because obviously it's not a it's not really like my question or my fight
7:15:42
right But I'm just wondering so if somebody were to do do a crime because you're talking about prison system
7:15:47
against someone because they were white is that not racism I I hope I don't sound ignorant I'm really just trying to
7:15:54
That was a good question That's a good question No it is a good question And in that sense I'd say yeah I guess
7:16:02
um probably yeah that would be a form of racism Um it's just the bigger picture
7:16:08
is systematic I'd say more prejudice I guess because it's based in just hate
7:16:13
and a dislike for that I guess for that race though right Maybe I'm not Maybe I
7:16:19
I feel I feel like maybe I don't understand what the word racist definitionally means I don't know But so
7:16:26
are there any instances where a black person can be racist towards a white person
7:16:32
You're asking me Oh I thought you were squiggly on this cuz you said it was prejudice right Yeah just the word Yeah
7:16:38
but I'm asking racist I I agree with what was your name again Gabby Gabby How
7:16:44
could you forget my home girl's name I apologize It's me and my my memory It's
7:16:50
okay It's okay Um yeah I would just say I agree with you that it's like racism
7:16:57
is systemic and like white people don't face the same type of systemic racism So
7:17:03
other races can be prejudiced towards white people but it's not the same exact racism Yeah I mean there's some
7:17:11
counter-arguments here I think you could argue that affirmative action is systemically racist uh against white
7:17:18
people Why Women got so many benefits out of affirmative action We benefited
7:17:23
white women Well there there's like there's gender-based affirmative action race-based uh affirmative action So you
7:17:30
would argue if like uh perhaps uh otherwise uh more merit-based white
7:17:37
candidates were overlooked because because of their race Uh you actually see this happening a lot with Asian
7:17:42
students in particular Uh so like there's a big scandal with these Ivy League schools Harvard for example M uh
7:17:49
so as an Asian person you had to score way higher than white people Latino
7:17:56
people uh and black people to be able to get in So that was like a sort of uh and
7:18:02
Asian people are minorities but they're like they're not the right kind of minority in the in the sense of well
7:18:10
they're they're discriminated against in a different sort of way That's still discrimination It is still
7:18:16
discrimination but like with Harvard basically they're like you know these Asian people are way too smart and we're
7:18:23
letting too many of them in That's but that's that would be a racist against
7:18:28
Asian people just in a sort of different way Absolutely Um but and it's also just
7:18:34
unfair I think the best people the best people should uh get the acceptance into
7:18:41
the university Yes And and when you overlook the best people the smartest people and well you know we got to do
7:18:48
the what is it The the inclusion thing Yeah No one's really doing that Yeah I I
7:18:54
get what you mean though Yeah And it should be the best candidate I think a study just came out um that showed and they did um across the board they did
Racism in the criminal system??
7:19:01
all fake you know applications or whatever Uh but a study over several years u not and I'm not debating
7:19:07
anything I'm just sharing the information Uh but uh they did white and black candidates um all fake
7:19:13
applications and they did uh white two four groups white that had no criminal
7:19:19
record white that had criminal record black that had no criminal record and black that you know what I'm talking about and then black with criminal
7:19:24
record And what they showed is that a white person with a criminal record was getting more job opportunities than a
7:19:30
black person with no criminal record So I I I I get that we shouldn't do a crazy
7:19:36
thing where it's like you should just get people in because of No one's really doing that though Um but I think that um
7:19:42
here here's something I can share I didn't realize that I had a bias I had an a bias in me and I was coaching You
7:19:49
don't like black people What No not that kind of bias Oh my bad Sorry Not that kind of bias I meant like I I I go
7:19:57
towards or move towards or select things that look like me And I didn't know that I was out doing that Years ago I was
7:20:02
working underneath a boss of mine and um she was having me do um the uh the
7:20:09
articles And so she's Latin I was doing the articles and I was selecting photos for the articles doing it for months
7:20:15
Thought I'm doing a great job And she sat me down and she was like "Hey let's uh let's look this over." She goes "Look at the articles I posted and published
7:20:22
and look at the articles that you posted and published Do you see any difference?" I looked at them I was like "No they look good I think I'm good
7:20:28
doing a good job And she goes "Look again." And I'm looking and I can't see it And she goes "Uh Natalie on mine I
7:20:35
have Asian black white I have all different ethnicities and races." She's like "You only put keep putting in white
7:20:42
people." And I was like "Oh." Oh So that's I Yeah So So going
7:20:48
back to the I guess the original thing here people of color can't be racist towards white people It's it's just uh
7:20:53
when it comes to the definition of racism you've you've changed the definition to be prejudice plus power
7:20:59
basically right Is that your definition And uh it's you've you've changed the
7:21:04
definition to suit you so that off well not saying not actually accusing you
7:21:09
guys of this but they've changed it so that your racism or your sexism can't be
7:21:14
labeled as such But um I think
7:21:20
that I look ultimately I think people should be judged as individuals not as part of some group identity But uh one
7:21:27
question to you Let's say there's a a company and the the CEO is black the
7:21:33
board of directors are black uh and they refuse to hire uh a white janitor Would
7:21:38
that be racism Why are they refusing to hire Just because of the racism Because he's white
7:21:45
But I'll let you answer Go ahead Those circumstances based in power
7:21:50
pretty much Mhm Yeah Yeah Why do you feel hesitant to just be like "Yeah
7:21:56
that'd be racist." It Well it is racist Oh okay All right And would you agree like would you agree with that if a a
7:22:03
black CEO of a multi-billion dollar company refused to hire a white janitor
7:22:09
Would that be racism It's solely just based off of his race Then yeah probably Okay we would call it
7:22:16
discrim Fair enough But yeah but but but the but go ahead Let's hear the broader
7:22:23
thing for me is just the mainly the systematic issues within racism itself
7:22:30
It doesn't b it benefits the white people more than it
7:22:36
does people of color So that's my main issue and that's why I see racism racism the way I do Um M okay I also just don't
7:22:44
think me well me personally because I'm halfway I don't think I can be racist to white people So it's just like
7:22:53
you can't be racist to your own race I can't be racist to my own race Can't you though Couldn't you Wait but hold on
7:23:00
Wait wait wait Let me give you an example Someone who's fully black refuses to hire black people because
7:23:07
they have negative opinions about black people Wouldn't that be rap I think that
7:23:12
would be racist Internalized racism Internalized racism Well it' still be racist I mean I'm like I'm not racist so
7:23:18
it's just like there's nothing I do that would be considered racist I don't really know Well you wouldn't do racist
7:23:24
things because you're not a racist I guess is Wait this is going to sound really bad but I have to I have autism
7:23:31
so I have to actually Are you actually Huh Never mind Are you Do you have autism Are you trying to bond over this
7:23:37
or something I'm not autistic I'm sorry Oh okay So can you not Don't do it now I'm just
7:23:46
asking can like are you allowed to say the N word Don't say it I'm just saying like
7:23:52
are you There's so much debate about it that I don't even know at this point because um people say I'm white passing
7:24:00
I don't know how I don't know Um I get told I look white passing I get told I'm
7:24:06
I don't look inherently white but I don't look just black either I look mixed And the thing is the thing is is
Mixed problems
7:24:12
because we're mixed we don't align with just one race We're both And the thing is they expect us to align with one more
7:24:20
than the other And it's also just you're not fitting into the groups themselves
7:24:25
Like it's hard to bond with a just white group And then it's sometimes it's hard to bond with just a black group And it
7:24:31
also comes down to like my family as well I am not close with either side It's I only have a few people I'm close
7:24:39
with and that's just because of my parents But it's just the matter of fact that I don't fit in anywhere and it's
7:24:44
just like you're within your own thing And some people say I can say it Um
7:24:50
other people But have you said it and has somebody gotten like mad at me for saying it Cuz I mean I can tell like you
7:24:57
you look like you're half white half black like it's not that Yeah So I don't
7:25:03
know I don't know And it's just also that mixed people don't really face the exact same racism as darker like as
7:25:10
fully black people do So that's another issue within itself There's just a ton of things But um I have like had like a
7:25:18
few people like be like just like one or two really be serious about me saying it
7:25:24
and it was literally just like me lip- syncing a freaking Tik Tok Um I have some in my comments be like "You're not
7:25:29
black." I'm like "Okay thank you." But um I do have people uh just like try to
7:25:35
be funny saying it like um I'm not going to really point out who
7:25:41
in my life did this but there's a white girl and she was saying uh Emer around
7:25:46
me and I was like you can't say that And she was like why can't I say you're half white and like it's just if I uh if I
7:25:55
called you my Caucasian would you be offended by that
7:26:00
It would just be funny I mean I'm still like if I dabbed you up My Caucasian I
7:26:05
would just laugh I'd be like my white I don't know My cracker I don't know
7:26:11
Okay Avoid avoid the word if you can but it's fine Um it's okay Yeah it's okay It's okay It's Don't worry You didn't
7:26:16
know It's not a big deal Um I mean no I'm still Caucasian I mean I'm still white I'm still black I mean I kind of I
7:26:22
guess I set I set that one up a little bit Charlie Johnson Did anyone here choose
7:26:27
to be the race and gender we are or did we all just get put here and now have to deal with our own choices in this life
7:26:33
My father always said no one chose to be the way they are were born I say judge
7:26:38
people by the content of their character That's beautiful Oh my god Charlie I love you Charlie
7:26:47
[Applause] notes Oh Christopher Murphy There's a
7:26:53
vast generational difference regarding the race topic Being raised colorblind used to be a virtue Now we have to kiss
7:27:01
the ass of those who look differently from white people Well that went through the other
7:27:06
Thank you Christopher Murphy for your message I'm going to let these two chats come through We got uh uh Oh boy Well it
7:27:14
is the roast session so [ __ ] it Why not We got We got to let a couple roast go through Based Thor donated $69 Sorry
7:27:22
Brian You need to give credits to your whatever chairs for putting up with the heavy amounts of weights dump trucks and
7:27:29
stacks all these years Those poor chairs Do we disinfect
7:27:35
the We clean We clean them after the show usually What kind of incale comment is that Hey you're such an incel That's
7:27:43
what she said Curtis donated $69 I firmly don't believe you can
7:27:49
change their race or gender but maybe your species seems to be transitioning from
7:27:55
human to a beached Yeah you know they really getting down Look guys I've
7:28:01
gained a bit of weight It's in the you know I'm going to lose it though It's coming off It's coming off I've been saying this for years but it's in the
7:28:07
work in progress What do you do to lose weight What do I do to lose weight Eat more burger Uh you have to think You
7:28:13
don't do nothing Wait what do you I do you look great I'm confused Well somebody said you didn't So
7:28:20
you were and you you lost weight too Didn't you say you lost like a lot of weight I lost a bit of it but I I put
7:28:27
that [ __ ] back on It's a work in progress though Yeah it's a work in progress All right Okay Let's uh do a
7:28:33
couple more here then Let's see We have Oh we did need to do Okay Uh a woman's
7:28:39
past should not matter We did talk about body count a little earlier Moon you agree A woman's past should not matter
7:28:46
Uh Gabby you agree a woman's past should not matter And uh remind me the
7:28:51
pronunciation when you when you when when you Yeah Did I do it right or no Uh
7:28:57
kind of A woman's past should not matter This is kind of related to body count Uh
7:29:03
why do you say that
7:29:08
Yeah I mean isn't that objectifying women Like if you consider that like if
7:29:14
she had sex with different people I I I don't know if it's objectifying
7:29:20
but uh here what what's your answer Why it doesn't m her past doesn't matter
7:29:26
Yeah Um why should a woman's past should or should not matter Really It depends on whether or not she's I mean I guess
7:29:33
changed from what she used to do Um it's also down to what that person is looking for If it matters to you then it matters
7:29:40
to you But inherently to me it doesn't matter and I don't think it really should matter in the long run because
7:29:47
what you do in the past you can't really make up for it you know like what you did like 10 years ago and you bring it
7:29:53
up and then someone's like oh I don't like you because of that are you the matter was a decade ago you know so I
7:30:00
think inherently it's kind of like just a stupid way of thinking is this question just oh go ahead just regarding
7:30:08
body count or just or just like a woman's past in general Uh it could be taken either way Well I know that we
7:30:14
already had like the body count conversation Yeah I'm just curious Body count I mean it could it could apply to other things but typically we're just
7:30:20
talking about body count Wait you do ASMR right The rest of the Oh my god Oh did you see my hidden ASMR channel I
7:30:25
don't like No but in the in the notes or I think in your bio you you do ASMR The
7:30:31
rest of the show you have to do ASMR So no you don't like it for free No I'm
7:30:36
just kidding I'm kidding And then uh Moon you said not like the weird kind Um
7:30:41
a woman's pass should not matter Why Why is that moon I mean I'll just use myself for an example If we're talking like you
7:30:47
know maybe body count and even maybe like criminal history like you wouldn't look at me and know I've been in jail
7:30:52
twice you wouldn't look at me and maybe you know guess my body count Like I can say that I have a pretty high body count
7:30:59
But like with that being said like I'm not a criminal I've never even really committed a crime um you know that's
7:31:06
part of my past is not who I am now and like yeah I'm a loyal person even though I have a high body count that's okay got
7:31:14
it um so here actually I want to ask uh you know what we we'll do uh we'll do
7:31:20

7:35:16

7:35:29
did Thank you Curtis Appreciate it I don't It doesn't offend me It doesn't bother me Uh thick skin I guess Okay Uh
7:35:37
wait where Oh body count Okay we did Boom Boom All right I think there's just
7:35:44
two more things maybe All right So Shannon you say uh women are oppressed
7:35:52
in the USA Or actually hold on We'll do men or No we're going to do men are more privileged in society than women You
7:35:58
agree Moon you agree Uh Gabby you
7:36:03
agree Uh when you did I say right when you going to say here
7:36:16
did I do Yeah Yeah What What's your Do you go uh That's your Chinese name right But do you go by like Sally or something
Female oppression
7:36:22
You know how like a lot of Chinese students they'll do like "Oh my name's Sally." I'm in the linguistics
7:36:27
department so I taught everybody how to pronounce my Chinese name Much like people like I can't learn I will say I'm
7:36:34
Cassie Cassie Okay I see That's all right Always pick the worst like names
7:36:42
though Like it's always like maybe it would have made sense like in the 80s or 70s but you guys got to get you know
7:36:48
like do like a crystal or something I've never heard like a like a Chinese person
7:36:53
who's using like an American name They're it's never like anything new like modern It's never like Crystal or
7:37:00
like Sheniqua or like Dakota Tena or some [ __ ] Never Tena You should start
7:37:07
sounding like a Py Pablo song Yeah Or like Becky or something Oh that would be great Becca Becca [ __ ] What about uh
7:37:16
Yeah Crystal or Sapphire or Mon'nique or Chastity or
7:37:24
what's like a stripper name Destiny Destiny What No there's a
7:37:30
What's like the go-to stripper name for a woman Isn't that it Crystal I think
7:37:35
it's Crystal I think it's Crystal All right Well anyways whatever Uh okay But I think anyone watching now has that
7:37:41
list so that's good So Shannon men are more privileged in society or in society
7:37:47
than women Why is that It's just how it's been for most of our society and it
7:37:54
hasn't really changed that much I mean it's it's slowly changing over time but
7:37:59
it just it hasn't really flipped that script in our society What what's like
7:38:04
give me just one example of men's men having privilege I mean men don't face
7:38:10
as much like essay as women do and they have just more opportunities to in in
7:38:18
the business world usually advance in their careers do they
7:38:24
typically yes I mean also it's not clear to me if like when it comes to
7:38:31
uh like when I when I think of privilege I tend to think of
7:38:37
something How can I best put this When I think of privilege like it's something that's granted right Like
7:38:45
uh I'm trying to think if there was there would be a like so for example men are more
7:38:52
likely to be victims of violent crime Is it a privilege to is it a privilege that
7:38:58
women have that they're less likely to be victims of violent crime as compared to men Would you say that's a female
7:39:04
privilege I mean I think that women do face a lot of violent crime in our society as well So I think it's just
7:39:11
violent crime is the issue Not as much it's a privilege for women because women
7:39:16
still have to deal with it right But men also are essay So but it's different
7:39:22
because it's like for women part of the assaulting is because of their because
7:39:28
they're women They're women So just to be clear when bad things happen to women it's because they're women And when bad
7:39:34
things happen to men I would say more specifically when it comes to essay it's a way for men to basically like control
7:39:43
and have dominance over women usually without their consent So it is something
7:39:49
that because you're a woman you're more subjugated to than if you're a man you
7:39:54
have the privilege of usually not being Yeah I mean I don't want to really go down I don't want to go down a deep
7:40:01
rabbit hole of like the essay topic I was always confused though And look perhaps it's the case Maybe there's
7:40:06
studies on it I'd be curious to see them This idea like I'm this idea that it's
7:40:12
about power Like maybe it is But to me the thing that would would make the most
7:40:18
sense is it's like just a piece of [ __ ] who's horny and wants to have sex But
7:40:26
like what gets them going Like what makes them horny I think it's like the thrill of the power that they have over
7:40:32
that other person right It's psychological a bit than just the like
7:40:38
physical Yeah There could be like maybe they get off to like well what what if
7:40:43
it's not about power They get off to harming somebody That is a power dynamic though because you're causing harm to
7:40:50
someone They're they're weaker than you in that instance Yes But in any case uh you mentioned when I said that men are
7:40:56
more likely to be victims of violent crime you said "Well but so are women also are victims of violent crime but
7:41:02
they're not as likely to be victims of violent crime as men are." Wait is essay not violent crime Sorry It's a component
7:41:09
Why Yeah I would say it's Yeah it falls under the umbrella It sounds like it's not counted counted in that for some
7:41:15
reason Like essay isn't considered the violent crime but the different violent crime No they counted in the statistics And overall my understanding is overall
7:41:23
including all violent crimes men are more likely to be victims of violent crime Interesting I' Yeah the numbers
7:41:30
that I saw were the other way but I' I'd love to see that Yeah it's it it's
7:41:37
pretty well established You can look at crime statistics Yeah but that's why I wasn't sure if essay was in there Victims of violent crime and or if they
7:41:43
put that under DV Other thing though is the the definition of grape for example
7:41:49
in certain jurisdictions like men can't be victims of grape That's awful Like uh that's
7:41:57
terrible Yeah If a woman grapes a man you might not believe that that's actually possible Definitely possible
7:42:03
But the actual definition of it they don't consider a woman forcing herself
7:42:10
onto a man They wouldn't consider that grape Do you know why they That's terrible Well I think it's just the
7:42:16
specific definition It's like there there's like a penetrative component to the crime
7:42:23
So I suppose like a a man could grape under the under that specific jurisdiction A man could grape another
7:42:29
man is my but even some of the definitions include the term like vagina for example Yeah So maybe based on
7:42:37
jurisdiction but it it skews the data a little bit But I I do want to I'm don't want to linger too long on that topic
7:42:42
just cuz it's kind of uh never it's kind of a buzzkill but men are more privileged in society than Well I'm
7:42:49
moving on to Moon Why is that Moon Oh uh definitely like in careers Um careers
7:42:54
Okay Even like with health I mean we talked about the fact that women have periods I mean I know guys get prostate
7:43:00
cancer and other things too but even just having the genitalia of a woman we get ovarian cancer cervical cancer like
7:43:07
just all kinds of benefits sometimes you know to being a man that we women just
7:43:13
don't have you know Okay What about you Um I'm not too sure about like wage gaps
7:43:20
and things like that Doesn't exist but see I don't know anything about it But
7:43:26
um I think it's more like for me socially I guess like just social aspects benefit men more than women Um
7:43:34
as well as just like general hate towards them And also the fact that there's like the overturning of Roie
7:43:41
Wade which is like kind of crappy And then there's just other things that are just very oppressive
7:43:49
Okay there's a lot there Um I won't be able to make counter arguments for all Well I could make counter arguments for
7:43:55
all of them but for the sake of time I can't Uh it's not clear to me at least with the the abortion argument that that
7:44:01
you made that that has anything to do with uh men being more privileged because males have no reproductive
7:44:07
rights whatsoever If the woman wants to get the abortion the man can't say anything about it If the woman decides
7:44:13
to keep the child the man can't do anything about it So I mean men have zero reproductive rights Yeah And I
7:44:19
think that I mean it's unfair and I think that's why it needs to be like when it comes to abortion it needs to be
7:44:25
a like lengthy discussion between you and your partner where you guys really
7:44:31
weigh the pros and cons and things like that Uh well yeah but you would you would agree that even if there was a
7:44:36
lengthy conversation and the woman was leaning towards get the abortion and the man was leaning towards keep the child
7:44:44
there's nothing that the man could actually do to force her to keep the child If she
7:44:50
wanted the abortion she can go get the abortion assuming she's in a state where abortion is legal Yeah that part right
7:44:57
Um what about you Uh why are men more privileged in society than women
Male privilege
7:45:02
Why are you talking about why Like how how rather in China employers would will
7:45:10
still ask about your marriage status like at interviews And like when I
7:45:15
graduated from my bachelor some of the boys from my class they didn't have good
7:45:21
grades at all but they got really good jobs just because like for English major
7:45:27
if you're a boy like they'll just take you because all others are were girls
7:45:32
but they want boys H I can't I'm not really particularly well-versed when it
7:45:38
comes to like feminism in China or the the gender uh the gender specifics in
7:45:44
China Um I I I am aware that there there are certain uh sexist practices in China
7:45:52
uh you know for example I believe with the one child policy uh there seemed to have been some preference towards uh
7:45:59
male Yeah uh boy boy babies Uh but I'm just not well verssed enough in uh the
7:46:07
the Chinese um uh gender politics or whatever to
7:46:14
really be able to address that adequately But uh I'll just say this
7:46:20
though What do you got I'll just say this I'm I'll just throw out my my favorite argument on
7:46:25
this All of women's collective grievances just fall completely flat in
7:46:32
the face of a singular sole male grievance and that's
7:46:40
war And you can look at that as military conscription I would even consider it within the purview of the volunteer men
7:46:47
who volunteer But forced military conscription I would argue and there's
7:46:55
uh the the suffering that men have exclusively faced in wartime and in war
MANDATORY military conscription
7:47:02
uh cannot be understated I would argue that if we're looking at amount of
7:47:08
suffering Yeah or amount of grievance I don't think you can look at anything and
7:47:14
tell me there's a singular female or even in totality of you put together all
7:47:20
of women's grievances Mhm And they fall flat in the face of war and forced
7:47:26
conscription Wouldn't that be though You guys are fighting other guys or fighting because I don't know some dictator is
7:47:32
doing some crazy stuff overseas So I mean you're fighting other men right And women didn't tell you to do like that
7:47:39
system is was set up by men We didn't set up
7:47:44
So a couple other just to be clear stop killing each other Throughout history there have been queens Yeah Currently
7:47:50
there are uh heads of state that are female that are involved in to some degree military conflicts Um or I let me
7:47:58
revise that a little bit There are uh there are countries with uh female heads
7:48:04
of state that are involved by proxy with certain wars and evens and anyways But
7:48:12
queens for example they actually did a study They looked at kings versus queens and they actually found that queens were
7:48:18
more likely to go to war than kings Was that cuz people were going after them because they were female or was that
7:48:25
studied at all I'm just curious I don't know the specific I don't know the specifics of it but my understanding of
7:48:32
the study was is that the these monarchs these queens they were more likely to go
7:48:38
to uh I don't know if it was start a war H I'll have to further look into that but I believe it's they were more likely
7:48:45
to start a war than kings Yeah I'm curious on it cuz I'm wondering if it is that they're like "Oh there's a female
7:48:51
head H let's go after her We can grab her land." And then she's having to defend But no there was but there was um
7:48:57
what's the name of that one queen in um Bloody Mary Yeah she had a lot But I you
7:49:02
made a point of like but it's men who are sending the men to war Yeah So like
7:49:09
what would that why would that matter Like men are not this hive mind collective like and neither are women
7:49:16
though Yeah I'm not saying that though Well you're saying like our our our collective grievances don't amount to
7:49:22
the war thing And I mean I maybe so but I guess how does that well so when I'm
7:49:28
talking about collective grievances the difference here is so you've you're talking about something else You're saying well who you're asking whose
7:49:35
fault is that Whose fault is that That doesn't really relate to my statement as
7:49:41
it relates to grievance comparison So So you're saying y'all
7:49:47
should be able to cry more than us because you have to go to war Is that what it is Uh I'm not saying men have to cry more
7:49:55
I'm saying if for example we're looking at if we're if we're looking at things
7:50:00
through the l through the lens of uh oppression or hurt or damage or
7:50:06
suffering uh or privilege or lack thereof then this specific thing I think
7:50:15
is worse and has caused more suffering in the specific gender men in this case
7:50:21
than all of women's collective grievances So you add all the up Oh we couldn't vote for a period of time and
7:50:28
uh we couldn't uh what we we couldn't women couldn't vote You uh the claims
7:50:35
about essay the claims about um gender gap the claims of whatever it is add
7:50:41
them all together not as bad as all the men who have died or been forced to go
7:50:47
to war I think it's Can I add to that though that okay obviously dying is the
7:50:53
worst situation especially in war However think about the women who
7:50:58
collectively lost their husbands to war They're grieving Obviously dying is the
7:51:03
worst situation but grieving that death having to raise the children and then having all of that collective stuff that
7:51:09
you kind of just downplayed a bit Uh it's it's there's a lot of there layers
7:51:15
to a woman grieving No I'm saying that dying is a war thing But okay but then
7:51:21
but who's left to take care of when the men die It's like the women who they've left behind and obviously like dying
7:51:28
like I've said is the worst situation in war However life does continue to go on
7:51:34
after death And who's there to have to Oh I see what you're saying Go ahead Deal with the ramifications It's the
7:51:40
women who you already admitted have been through these the traumatic situations
7:51:45
And I'm not downplaying men's part in war is obviously completely traumatic We
7:51:52
see that Um it's just different types of trauma like women have to carry with them the trauma of having a husband
7:51:58
who's died in war as well Yeah So is your position that uh I mean you didn't indicate it here Do you think uh women
7:52:05
are the primary victims of war No Because dying is obviously Okay So
7:52:11
you're saying men are the primary victims of war But and I don't disagree with you So I also wanted to just kind of recap in in saying that that I don't
7:52:17
think that it should really be taken as a issue of the sexes or genders I think
7:52:23
it should be taken that we collectively as men and women are actually basically
The primary victim of war...is EVERYONE?
7:52:30
fighting against like the 1% the people who are in power who are causing wars to actually happen Like we were saying
7:52:35
kings and queens We're turning it into a gender argument But like we just said both sexes genders whatever we want to
7:52:43
call it suffer immensely from war So to be like sure Okay But they're still
7:52:49
disputing that I mean death is the ultimate suffering So I'm not going to say that that's not true
7:52:57
However women have to carry on life after death and that is a a terrible
7:53:03
process of grieving and then having to take care of children that are still
7:53:09
alive who actively don't have a parent in the home anymore So it's it's
7:53:14
terrible all around Yeah it's all So yes So I'll I'll engage there So I think the
7:53:21
f the where I would be where I would begin with this is that you would you would also have to
7:53:27
acknowledge that men have male relatives too So that would be further not just
7:53:32
female suffering when men die but also male suffering when men die whether it's fathers brothers friends or sons And I
7:53:40
agree that those men usually have to step in and kind of take care of the children of the Yeah in in the community
7:53:47
My next point would be though is that while I'll agree with you that uh men
7:53:52
aren't the exclusive sufferers when it comes to war Yeah women also suffer children suffer boys and girls suffer
7:53:59
when it comes to war War everybody suffers right But I think it's uh it's
7:54:06
going to be a hard cell to tell me that when we're looking at something that's gender specific in this case every
7:54:12
single country in the world I think except for maybe there might be some small one I I'm not aware of or Israel
7:54:19
where uh forced military conscription is exclusively male in all the other countries absent uh maybe one or two in
7:54:27
any case it's uh it doesn't matter because of all the major countries only
7:54:33
men are subject to force military conscription do you have something or yeah actually um recently there's a
7:54:39
villain post certain states you do have to sign up for uh women do have to sign
7:54:44
up for drafts There's erroneous It's that's erroneous I'm not It's not true
7:54:51
It's It is It's opt in or it's Women can volunteer to join the military but
7:54:56
there's no First off it wouldn't be at the it wouldn't be at the state level that this would be be done The selective
7:55:03
service system is a federal system So it would be it would be done at the federal
7:55:08
level So there's this idea that on the individual state level some of the women can be drafted It's just not true And
7:55:15
there's no bill I I can't Maybe there's some dumb bill that's been introduced in a state legislature I can't imagine it's
7:55:22
enforceable Uh I don't I don't even believe that that's true but it would be at the federal level Oh no See I think
7:55:29
it's more of a class war situation than it is the actual like gender war that we want to make it into Because like we
7:55:35
just said men are suffering immensely from going to war Women are suffering immensely from not having their husbands
7:55:41
around in the home to care for the children Everyone's suffering and I think it's collectively because like
7:55:48
usually the people suffering the most are the lower class cuz those are the ones who are getting drafted or deciding
7:55:53
to go into the army Okay So I want to finish making my point here
7:55:59
Okay So I'm trying to remember recall exactly what Oh okay You were saying
7:56:05
well the the wives and the the mothers and the the daughters they all suffer
7:56:10
right when men die in war Um what would you think if I made the following
7:56:15
argument that in rebuttal to the pain that women
7:56:21
experience when they're essay I said well their brothers and their fathers
7:56:27
and their boyfriends and their husbands suffer when women and I'm I'm using that
7:56:33
to mis to redirect and misdirect from your claim about the suffering it causes women when they're essayed And I say
7:56:41
"Yeah but let's think about the men in their lives." You would find that objectionable I'm sure Well they're the
7:56:47
ones doing the essaying Usually the brothers and the boyfriends no but men
7:56:52
in general So it does hurt the the people in the women's lives the men in the women's lives who are getting
7:56:59
essayed It does hurt them because it hurts their reputation and also like they could say something to other men to
7:57:07
try to help prevent these things this I don't feel like you're actually contending with my argument So I'll give you a different example Uh when women go
7:57:15
through pregnancy it's really hard for the husbands And we I mean husbands have a a part in
7:57:22
making a child So it should be hard for the husbands as well Well I don't think it should be but uh yeah I mean if your
7:57:29
wife or the person who you are having a baby with is suffering then like we were
7:57:34
talking about way at the beginning of this conversation you should have empathy for your partner So if your partner is having a hard time you then
7:57:41
also would be having a hard time as well Not as hard If I said because of the
7:57:47
frustrations or whatever that men experience during women's pregnancy and I used it to try to dismiss your point
7:57:53
about the suffering that women experience or the pain that women experience or the discomfort that women experience when it comes to pregnancy
7:57:59
and childirth you would find this laughable I mean to a certain degree because it's
7:58:05
like physically happening to the woman where it's like more of a mental strain for a man or like financial strain But
7:58:10
you can't genuinely tell me that you would say that the discomfort and pain that women experience during pregnancy
7:58:16
and childirth is anywhere near comparable to the uh supposed uh
7:58:23
frustration or pain mental pain that the man might feel Uh cuz it could be you know seeing your wife giving birth and
7:58:30
she's in physical pain That could be distressing to a man but you would never say that that's anywhere near
7:58:36
approaching the woman who's actually going through the child birth You'd never say that it's anywhere approaching
7:58:42
the level of pain or suffering she's going through That's true Okay So I
7:58:48
think we're going to have to agree that the suffering that men experiences more is dwarfs the the look just to be clear
7:58:57
if you lo lose uh if you're a woman and you lose uh a son or you lose a husband
LIVING is worse than DEATH?
7:59:03
or you whatever it is you lose a male figure in your life in war that's
7:59:08
terrible That's going to be an awful experience That's that you're going to you're going to be grieving That's going to be awful But the thing is is that
7:59:15
people can come back from grief People come back from grief all the time People parents die grandparents
7:59:23
die and people get back to their life When you're dead you're dead It's final
7:59:30
It's over Your life's over Yeah I'm saying in regards to comparing
7:59:36
women and men suffering I would say obviously dying is the worst situation
7:59:43
However it is final However the person who is grieving that like I was saying
7:59:49
you have to raise potentially children alone now in a situation So it's an
7:59:56
ongoing suffering on top of the suffering we already previously talked about where you were saying like women
8:00:03
couldn't vote women didn't have as many rights Like it's adding trauma
8:00:08
I know that's a buzz word What Adding trauma What do you mean like women if
8:00:14
the husband dies and more Yeah that's traumatic Yeah I'm not disputing that
8:00:19
it's going to be really bad if your significant other dies or your brother
8:00:25
dies or whatever it is But if you're trying to compare the suffering between men and women women's after that point
8:00:31
like you die you're done Women is ongoing suffering You're forgetting one
8:00:36
important thing though is that the suffering men experiences that men experience in war is not strictly
8:00:43
related to death That's true There is the PTSD of it There's PTSD these there's the actual like in the
8:00:51
[ __ ] you know like if you look at historical wars for example and if we're allowed to say that women's historical
8:00:57
grievances are uh you know if you bring up women often or feminists often bring
8:01:02
up uh women not being able to vote okay so I'm going to bring up World War I
8:01:07
World War II These were absolutely brutal wars Trench warfare totally catastrophic Uh what they witnessed what
8:01:14
they experienced absolutely terrible They came back with just to either de
8:01:19
debilitating physical injuries if they didn't die Um or just mentally
8:01:25
completely thrashed and destroyed Uh you know shell shock uh war fatigue or
8:01:31
there's a different term for it with fatigue PTSD as it's now called I completely understand And I think that
8:01:37
if instead of having conversations about which gender is suffering more we can
8:01:44
collectively agree we're all suffering under this system And so why don't we band together and say "Hey we're all
8:01:51
collectively suffering here as a lowerass people." And it's really the people above us in like the top 1% who
8:01:57
are causing these wars to happen who are profiting off of us and and this collective trauma Yeah I I I have a
8:02:04
response to this Um okay Do you think there should be a revolution
8:02:09
Um I I'm not exactly sure what should happen Are you are you uh in terms of
8:02:15
your political leanings would you consider yourself like a communist or socialist Um I would say I lean more
8:02:20
towards socialism However I don't really have like this utopian concept
8:02:27
personally I'm not exactly sure what the right answer is moving forward So but you think
8:02:32
the you're saying the people who don't have the means of production should band
8:02:39
together and overthrow the bourgeoisi I'm not exactly sure if an overthrowing
8:02:45
is exactly what needs to happen I don't know if it could even happen But clarify you said the what the the lower and
8:02:51
middle class should band together Yeah And do what So do what I think that
8:02:57
instead of having conversations where we're saying women suffer more no men
She wants a revolution + oppression olympics
8:03:02
suffer more we should collectively say we as lowerass people are all suffering
8:03:07
together and we should definitely try to implement some change I don't know if it's an entire revolution I don't think
8:03:14
that is potentially even possible with just how life is nowadays However I do
8:03:20
think that having conversations together instead of trying
8:03:25
to play trauma dump Olympics is going to
8:03:31
be the answer Like we're all collectively suffering when it comes to things like war And war
8:03:38
is typically something that the upper class uses towards the lower class to keep them in place and to cause
8:03:44
suffering like we just said But I mean you're you're talking about Okay So I mean to what end do you want
8:03:51
the lower and middle class to band together I'm assuming it would be like revolutionary If we look historically at
8:03:57
revolutions you look at the communist revolution in in uh well the USSR Russia well what became the USSR
8:04:06
Uh did that I mean did they not have a military Did they not send men to war In
8:04:12
fact my understanding if you look at the the Communist Revolution
8:04:17
uh World War II they lost a [ __ ] ton of men A [ __ ] ton of men died in World War
8:04:24
II who were part of the Red Army the Soviet army
8:04:29
I don't I don't have an ultimate answer of a utopia here I just think my theory is that instead of making it where we're
8:04:36
competing against who's suffering more we should have a collective mindset that
8:04:42
we're all suffering under the system But hold on Isn't that
8:04:47
feminism Women suffer more Women are disadvantaged as compared to men So
8:04:53
you're you're you're trying to disregard my arguments as to uh male suffering and
8:05:00
say "Well we shouldn't play these games of oppression Olympics but this is a game that feminism started right?"
8:05:08
So you're going to have to completely dismiss feminism and you're gonna have
8:05:13
to say feminism is [ __ ] Feminism sucks Women's rights advocacy like all
8:05:19
that You have to dismiss all that and say it's [ __ ] because that's exactly
8:05:24
what feminism is Comparing men to women saying here's how women have it worse
8:05:31
compared to men They have had it in regards to their rights and abilities
8:05:36
worse than men until very recently I disagree I think men have had it worse Not just they men have it worse today
8:05:44
and historically I mean depends on the man and the
8:05:49
situation I don't think that's generalizing that I'm not sure If anyone else wants to see that feminism yeah
8:05:56
there were look there were there were men who were homeless in the 1910s and there were women who were like living
8:06:03
incredible like uh they were part of the upper class and they were living great lives There also women who are also on
8:06:10
the streets Well actually I mean when it comes to homelessness men are much more likely to be homeless But uh both in
8:06:17
modern day and historically But she was trying to make the point well you have to it depends on the person and it's
8:06:22
like well we can look back historically or modern day we can find evidence of women who have it worse than a
8:06:29
particular man and we can look at a particular man who has it worse than a particular woman Yeah I think women are
8:06:35
saying that we have had it worse than men saying feminism just means equal
8:06:42
rights You're talking about ultra feminism worse Feminism just means equal rights for men and women And then ultra
8:06:47
feminism is what you're describing Feminism has always been a grievance movement related to women have it worse
8:06:55
That's in your I don't know anyone who's saying that we have worse or that it's not good It's not who's worse We want to
8:07:02
vote That was it It was like feminism Hey we want to vote How about that And then we're like hey you also suffer Why
8:07:08
don't we do something about it What's the solution Okay but so hold on So you said feminism is an equality movement
Feminism vs Brixan
8:07:14
right Men and women deserve equal rights is the definition Does that include
8:07:19
gender roles What do you mean by gender roles Well I mean there's been a big push by feminists to dismantle and destroy
8:07:27
gender roles especially traditional gender roles as it relates to women But I I want to ultra feminism There's there
8:07:33
so there's different levels We even learned that in psychology a long time ago There's actually like different levels of feminism And then you have
8:07:39
people that are like extremely egregious women Yeah Look it's it's mainstream
8:07:45
feminism Mainstream feminism is about destroying traditional gender roles for
8:07:51
women Mainstream feminism is about grievances Mainstream feminism uh
8:07:57
mainstream feminism puts forward this I think dubious patriarchy theory and it
8:08:04
paints men as the oppressors and women as the oppressed This is this isn't like
8:08:09
fringe radical feminism Mainstream mainline feminism is patriarchy theory
8:08:16
Uh women's grievances and men oppressors women oppressed That's that's basic
8:08:22
patriarchy theory You're going to learn at like any college in a feminist studies group I wish that we didn't
8:08:27
label it though because back in the day we we decided to start labeling it that and then going okay mainstream feminism
8:08:34
and then what happened was it was like ah crap you know there goes the labels on that just like overdoing it with narcissism and trauma and now when you
8:08:41
actually have what the real word actually means you don't get to use it anymore cuz the moment I say feminism
8:08:46
everyone's gonna have a trigger I mean it's always been bad it's always been bad and I'll explain well here's no no I
8:08:52
I think I think that I think that women coming to the table and going Hey we want to come to the table for you too I
8:08:58
I don't think that that's a bad thing I think that I think y'all should go to war I have two sons I would go to war before I send any of my boys to fight
8:09:06
But that's not a we suffer more versus that's like No Yeah Men suffer so much
8:09:11
y'all We We wanted to be We would just rather It's systematic sexism towards
8:09:17
men You're absolutely right Who's doing it though Not us It doesn't matter It wouldn't matter So look So I think that's none of us are But it's men But
8:09:24
it's men who do it I'll tell you look men men as a group didn't create uh male
8:09:30
only selective service Men don't maintain it Uh like I as a man have no
8:09:36
more say in how selective service is uh is run than does a woman We as women are
8:09:44
trying to say that we feel for you and we don't want that to happen to you as men So and we want a seat at the table
8:09:50
to vote against it Yeah We want to be able to vote Uh but here's where I'm going to get you guys So here's where
8:09:56
I'm going to get you guys And there's a couple there there are a couple things I want to say Um but really quick before I
8:10:03
before I address the the draft thing uh you were saying how feminism like feminism has never been about equality
8:10:10
and I can prove it So women got the right to vote in 1920 Yes Right before
8:10:15
that just a few years before that was the most catastrophic brutal worldwide
8:10:20
war that has ever occurred World War I right I I forget the exact numbers I
8:10:25
think it's uh 10 million 20 million deaths or casualties Casualties would include injuries and so forth Uh
8:10:32
completely brutal Just look if you guys want to have a glimpse of the
8:10:38
understanding of how brutal World War I is go watch or well you could also read
8:10:44
the book All Quiet on the Western Front I think it's on Netflix All Quiet on the Western Front Totally brutal I think
8:10:51
most people don't No offense to you guys Do you guys like have you seen like even
8:10:56
a historical fictional war movie Yes Like a lot War is brutal in ways you can
8:11:02
and those movies don't even capture 1% of the brutality and suffering men have
8:11:08
experienced Yeah But World War I happened a a few years before uh women's
8:11:15
suffrage in 1920 Why is it the case that women were able to secure the right to vote without any
8:11:22
corresponding responsibility Men have duties Women don't What kind of duties
8:11:29
are you talking about Were we trying to do we want those duties So a lot of women didn't want to get the right to
8:11:35
vote because they were worried if they did get the the right to vote they would be treat they would because they were
8:11:40
fighting for equality they would be treated as equals to men meaning they would be subject to forced military
8:11:46
conscription Right This is something that's coming up as you're talking though is interesting because it feels
8:11:51
like when it was feminism and don't get me wrong it really was from the beginning there was a delineation between feminism and ultra feminism I do
8:11:58
remember that from 20 years ago Um it does feel like there's this kind of counter point here going on that it's
They don't want ANY duties
8:12:04
like a lot of us are coming to the table and go yeah you guys shouldn't be suffering and you shouldn't be suffering at the hands of other men you shouldn't
8:12:10
be suffering at the hands of women we are coming to the table it's like yes two things coexist we're trying to make it a causality and a and a thing instead
8:12:17
of it two being doing two separate things yes women right to vote doing certain things and at the same time men
8:12:24
suffering is terrible and I have friends that have been going in hard on trying to get more money to the DA and more
8:12:30
work for men and more you know all kinds of things because it does affect our entire community It affects everyone
8:12:36
obviously we've said that in different ways it sure on the war thing whatever but not whatever but you know what I
8:12:43
mean um it affects you guys come home there's a lot of PTSD the women takes it
8:12:48
too there's PTSD in the home the child gets PTSD all kinds of things it sure
8:12:53
what's the solution well I'll I'll address that in just a moment I just want to make it clear though feminism
8:12:58
has never been about equality and I'll prove it so 1914 1918 World War I 1920 women get
8:13:06
the right to vote but they also don't have any like I said corresponding responsibility as it relates to forced
8:13:13
military conscription They're they're exempt from having to register with selective service and they're exempt
8:13:19
from the draft right And then women do that Mind you it's been a century right
8:13:24
We've had a century of feminism I don't hear women or excuse me I don't hear feminists advocating for let's equalize
8:13:32
the draft I don't hear that You do No but let me let me just You have it in Israel
8:13:38
Stop Stop Stop I'd like to finish my point I'd like to finish my point And so it's never been about equality Just to
8:13:44
be clear feminism is a woman at the most charitable I'll be is a women's advocacy
8:13:50
movement I think there's a lot of uh there's a lot of misandry in the movement Uh I think I think I can see
8:13:58
that Yeah So it's it's man-hating I think it's man-hating patriarchy theory
8:14:03
total conspiracy theory It paints men as uh predators It paints women as uh
8:14:09
perpetual victims Men are the oppressors Women are the oppressed It's feminism's never been about equality But if I'm
8:14:15
going to be as charitable as I can be feminism is a woman's advocacy movement And there's nothing wrong with women's
8:14:22
advocacy But to try to parade that as some sort of equality movement if you're
8:14:28
advocating for women great What does that have to do with equality Absolutely nothing And I'll continue to prove it
8:14:34
once more So as related to the draft again it's 2025 Women have had over a
8:14:40
century to equalize this Not equalized Feminism Uh women have plenty of
8:14:45
political capital Uh most uh elections are dictated by women except for this
8:14:50
most recent one Uh women make up the majority of the voter base If you guys
8:14:56
wanted to you could with your political capital as women could get this passed
8:15:02
But it's just not one it's just not politically tenable because women enjoy their privilege of not being subject to
8:15:09
military conscription I think it's uh I don't I certainly don't think it's a privilege that men are the exclusive uh
8:15:17
I'll just say victims of forced military conscription You're talking about a couple things though in there too You're also adding in power Sorry Continue Well
8:15:24
just a few more things here on this Uh there's other examples too where look
8:15:29
outside of giving the examples I'll just say this If conceivably equality a form of equality would not
8:15:38
stand to benefit a woman but it would be equality Like we would agree that a
8:15:45
there could be a form of equality that could be to the detriment of women Feminism will not fight or advocate for
8:15:53
said equality if it conceivably comes like I said to the detriment of women
8:15:59
And this is exactly this is exactly how the feminism movement is not an equality
8:16:04
movement I think that there's 50/50 in that And I agree with that I think that that's why I said I was like there's a part in there that we're also starting
8:16:11
to talk on now which is privilege and power Because now all of a sudden now all of a sudden when you've been at the
8:16:17
bottom so to speak or you look at yourself as the bottom when you view yourself as the oppressed sometimes what happens is if you don't heal from that
8:16:24
mindset you start to get power or you start to get that privilege and suddenly you don't really want to have that taken
8:16:30
away or you don't want the full part of it So women with each other we have our
8:16:35
own communication we have our own like you know you said it we've talked about it earlier women shame other women women
Return to the draft: Is there an INCENTIVE to join the military?
8:16:41
are still like we're still working on for instance when I tell women that I'm a coach for men they're like oh good
8:16:47
they need it and immediately I'm like no we do too and that's it's just ridiculous because if a if you don't
8:16:54
heal regardless of who hurt you you're just going to wind up giving that pain to someone else or continuing to take it
8:17:00
on So there's a lot to be said that it's like yeah we hear you We know there's a lot of women who would love that right
8:17:05
to be able to go and into war and do that and some countries have that and that's that's what they wanted So we're
8:17:11
looking at like you know the Kairens of the world too We still have to battle and other women have to battle that [ __ ]
8:17:19
You had something sh Yeah That's why I think now this is more of a class issue than it is a gender issue because women
8:17:26
can fight in war and actively choose to participate because of the benefits that
8:17:31
going into the service gets them because they're usually lowerass people Yeah
8:17:37
they can I agree with you that women can volunteer to uh it didn't fully like equal out
8:17:44
obviously cuz women haven't been able to for so long until more recently But women still actively do go into the
8:17:52
service Yeah Vol voluntarily But even if you look at the But is it voluntarily
8:17:58
though If you're somewhat forced into it because of your class No Hold on Nobody's forced to join the military
8:18:05
You're not forced But there is a pressure when you are of lower class No Look I Yeah because there's there's an
8:18:11
incentive Sure There's an incentive but there's also an incentive to get a job at McDonald's There is Yeah there's more
8:18:18
incentive though when it comes to the military because they prey on the lower class I mean I'm talking to recruiters
8:18:25
now and they are telling me the same thing Like for me being like a single mom and student it would it made sense
8:18:31
for me to enlist cuz I mean that's housing that's school that's health that's dental my kids are covered Those
8:18:37
are all selling points those selling like and so if you're already at a lower class status and you're already
8:18:43
struggling you're already despared you're already those things somebody offering you pretty much a set future
8:18:49
for the rest of your life to sign up for it It's going to look pretty good I mean
8:18:54
like it does That's why you have people enlisting every day women and me I I do We have women in our family that have
8:18:59
enlisted a lot too Yeah I'm gonna address really quick just the draft thing right And I think this will maybe
8:19:05
change your mind So you guys all said "Well maybe we should just get War is so bad There should never be war." Oh we
8:19:11
wish but that's [ __ ] utopia that doesn't exist You know it's you know and there should never be crime and nobody
8:19:18
should ever have any cancer or injury Are we talking about Norway I'm sure we can all agree Are we describing Norway
8:19:24
and Switzerland We can all agree that yeah how the world should be But if we're looking at h how the world is
8:19:31
right war is going to be a reality Yeah like there's no escaping it And even if
8:19:38
uh as a country you're like well I don't want to have an army you do so at your own peril
8:19:45
because if you do get invaded you've just lost your your sovereign nation And
8:19:53
so the point I would make is this and I think I'll perhaps change your mind on the draft Uh look I don't think the
8:20:00
draft is good but I think it's one of those uh there's a specific term for this uh a ne not a necessity but a
8:20:08
necessary evil Nec sort of a necessary evil Uh so uh which I which I will
8:20:15
acknowledge uh men are the victims victims of and it's it's awful and it
8:20:22
shouldn't happen but it does But I'll explain it like this Here's this scenario
8:20:28
Uh I this Well should I use China Okay we'll use All right I'm gonna So okay
8:20:36
here we live in the United States right We live in the United States and
8:20:41
China we know China's going to invade our country It's hypothetical
8:20:47
Definitely not We're not invading any country No I know I'm just uh I'm fine
8:20:52
I'll change it to uh No I'm gonna pick a I'm gonna pick uh
8:20:58
let's do Kazakhstan Yes Kazakhstan becomes a superpower somehow I don't
8:21:04
know And or we just become like really shitty I don't know And uh this country
8:21:09
though uh they're going to invade us And this country is evil And we know what's
8:21:16
going to and they invaded another country near them And we know what happened to that country This is what
8:21:22
happened to that country They killed all the men and then they took all the women
8:21:28
as war brides That's happened Yeah And I mean historically yes this has happened
8:21:33
And they essay all the women Yep And we know that this country when they
8:21:39
do invade us in say a year they're planning the invasion We find out in a year they're going to invade
8:21:45
us If we don't draft men to fight for the country they're going to kill all the all the men anyways and then they're
8:21:52
going to essay all the women Mhm Under these circumstances are you as women
8:21:57
here's the entailment If you don't let's say and you all get to vote on if there
8:22:02
should be a draft that happens If you don't vote to draft the
8:22:09
men to go to war there's not going to be enough of a military force to repel the
8:22:15
enemy There's just not You have to force the men to fight because the volunteer force isn't strong enough to repel the
8:22:22
enemy Question If you don't you're going to get essay and all the men are going to die Yeah Do you vote to draft the men
8:22:29
Question Sure Um are in this scenario or what do you believe And I'm just curious
8:22:35
Do do you think that answer the question before I give my position No but I meant um so for this would it be that women
8:22:40
can also be drafted Can we are we voting in that women get drafted as well too No just the men Really But then why But do
8:22:47
you think that women should have also be a part of that draft I mean they have it in other countries
8:22:54
Well in my specific example it's just the men And I mean that's how most uh
8:22:59
military conscription works around the world It's just the men who are subject to it
8:23:05
It sounds like we're losing either way draft or no draft in this scenario So no in the scenario uh I'll just go ahead
8:23:11
and say in the scenario if you do draft the men you do win Okay that was that was my could make it I could change the
8:23:17
scenario where it's like well uh you know for sure if you don't draft the men you're going to lose but if you do draft
8:23:24
the men it's even 50/50 I we can change it to that So would the women in here
8:23:30
reenact the draft if war was imminent with some country Would you vote to draft the men I would say yes I would
8:23:36
say yes Yeah Everybody they're suffering So I'd say yeah You have to pick the
8:23:42
even if that takes away men's uh free will
8:23:48
because you being drafted Well you would be sending men who don't want to go and fight to go and fight So you're taking
8:23:53
away their their free will and agency But all their wives and mothers and all
8:23:59
those people would get said if we decided not to And they'd probably all
8:24:04
because we have they would die anyway So I guess we would have to death I don't
8:24:10
either way is death I would say no just because I wouldn't send my Yeah death seems imminent I wouldn't send my sons
8:24:17
over there just to prevent me from or some other woman from getting s aid Um I
8:24:22
would say no Like we're all fighting or we're all dying That's all Yeah Honestly I would push and I would keep advocating
8:24:28
for if that's the case then I think women need to be in the draft on that one too We all need to be World War II
8:24:34
we had it where women went to the workplace and started doing that's not the same But there means that we can do something if that's the 40s and we can
8:24:40
sit there and push for like hey this is eminent which means that if it's eminent then we're going to have a serious conversation on well if that's the case
8:24:47
then women need to be in the table on on the draft and that would be the push The opposing nation isn't going to have a conversation They're ready to go Yeah
8:24:53
But that's what I'm saying then it's like you can do that quickly You can do an executive order where you go "Hey women are now um in in this draft
8:25:00
order." Cuz you said it's a year away They found out that it's a year So oh I guess I push I'm pushing for here's what
8:25:07
we're going to uh here's what we're going to do just to get this wrapped up We'll do a brief roast session I you know whatever $30 TTS then we're going
8:25:13

8:26:21

8:26:44
them in $30 TTS $30 TTS Uh we'll we'll let it go for about 5 10 minutes Um one
8:26:51
last I guess one or two last things from the questionnaire here Uh women are oppressed in the USA Shannon you agree
8:26:59
Moon you agree Uh let's see Anyone else Gabby you agree Uh just really quick how
8:27:07
are women oppressed in the USA I know we talked about privilege but how are they oppressed
8:27:14
Um I would just say in it's baked into our society Like women still don't seem
8:27:19
to have the same um level of seriousness when it comes to the workplace Like
8:27:25
women aren't taken as seriously and um yeah just in general socially like women
8:27:31
aren't taken as seriously as men Okay Um All right What about you Moon you uh how
8:27:39
are women oppressed Um you know no offense but I mean I would even say like
8:27:45
just the fact like like this podcast in general we are having to
CHILDBIRTH is WORSE than WAR?
8:27:51
defend basically who we are what we believe in and some of the stuff that we didn't even have any control over such
8:27:57
as like the draft and stuff You know I I get war I think it's horrible You know I think all of that's just disgraceful But
8:28:04
like to me nothing compares to child birth And the day that a man can pull another human out of his body then we'll
8:28:10
talk I mean war is war but none of that has any balance towards child birth if you
8:28:18
ask me Voluntary child birth Not all child birth is voluntary What percentage
8:28:24
of child birth is I have no idea But not all child birth is voluntary And child birth lasts 9 months Some women die It's
8:28:31
pain It's it's a horrible thing And no man can do it And then when y'all sit here and you say "But aren't we stronger
8:28:37
than you?" Then go to war Why are you crying about it like that Why is it this big thing You just said y'all are
8:28:43
stronger You want women with low body counts You want us to be at home You want us to be that model woman that's
8:28:51
beautiful and soft and submissive but you don't want to go like you can't have it both ways You can't have us and then
8:28:59
No I mean if it's just I believe we should not send men to war at all We
8:29:04
should just send the war I think we all That'd be sick I want to send Gabby to war She'd do it She'd be lethal Wait
8:29:10
what did you say I want to send you to war I actually was thinking with the proper because um
8:29:18
college sucked I think I got to hold on I got to address
8:29:23
that first point you made though Child birth is worse than like the brutality
8:29:30
of war I would say because the amount that most women most women are going to
8:29:37
have to go through child birth I mean sure some volunteer volunteer to give birth Most women want children Men want
8:29:44
children But we are the only sex that has to go through nine months of usually
8:29:52
uncomfortable living and then painful birth or surgery Yeah I agree Look um
8:29:57
I'm not going to dispute that pregnancy and child birth is uh painful or discomforting or like war is painful or
8:30:04
suffering or whatever but but I don't think you're going to make a compelling argument that child birth can be nearly
8:30:12
as uh bad as war No I'm saying for me personally it's
8:30:19
like like she said too I think there are things and suffering on both side And
8:30:25
most women today I think especially the ones sitting here we don't want any of us to suffer We don't want y'all to go
8:30:30
to war We don't like I get your argument but I think my question behind the whole
8:30:35
men going to war thing was like what what's your point Like we get it We see it We don't like it What is your point
8:30:42
behind it like "Oh we we also deserve a blankie because we suffer too." We knew that we knew that women did I'll explain
8:30:49
No Yeah I'll I'll explain We want to do something about No I'll explain So So feminism has always been about a
8:30:56
comparison Women have it worse to men but I just reject this categorically
8:31:01
both modern day and historically So this idea that like the the point I'm trying
8:31:08
to make by bringing up warfare is that it's clearly ignored as a genderbased
8:31:16
grievance but it clearly is a gender-based grievance If you look at the distribution of men who are soldiers
8:31:24
and not just on not just that but even if you do do a comparison between male soldiers and female soldiers men are
8:31:32
almost almost exclusively the frontline soldiers Exclusively the ones that are injured exclusively the ones that are
8:31:39
frontline combat that are getting killed Yep Or PTSD or all of these things Women
8:31:45
often even when they are in the military they're not on the front lines They're
8:31:50
not going to raid Osama bin Laden's thing They're not Seal Team Six or whatever you know all that stuff Women
8:31:58
are typically in administration roles They're in support roles Men are overwhelming Like even in that scenario
8:32:04
where women are in the military So this comparison feminism's always been about a comparison And I'm saying actually now
8:32:12
that you're playing the comparison game between men and women I'm gonna play it too And I'm gonna say that if we're
8:32:20
looking at the totality of circumstances and there's a bunch of by the way besides war men are more likely to be
8:32:26
homeless Men are less likely to go go to college Men are more likely to unal alive themselves Men are more likely to
8:32:32
be incarcerated Men are more likely to be victim of violent crime There's plenty of things that I can tell you
8:32:39
besides just the war argument where men are disproportionately impacted with negative life outcomes It's interesting
8:32:45
to me You you I think part of feminism is the apex fallacy You look at the top
8:32:53
1% or 10% of men and you attribute that ex lived experience Oh that's how all
8:32:59
men must experience life But the reality is here's my argument is that while it might be the case that there's more male
8:33:06
CEOs and there's more men who are rich and there's more men who occupy boardrooms and there's more men who
8:33:13
occupy positions of power I'm not going to argue any of that I'm not going to dispute any of that I'm going to go ahead and agree and grant it However I
8:33:21
think a greater proportion of women enjoy what I would call the middle the
8:33:27
comfortable middle And then though if we're looking at this like a pyramid sure let's just go ahead and put men on
8:33:33
top And then in the middle where it's like you're living like your life's good your life's okay It's you're not a
8:33:40
superstar CEO or you're not uh you don't have power or whatever Although we can
8:33:46
have conversations of the soft power that women do have but at the very bottom of this pyramid you see almost
8:33:52
exclusively men the most dangerous jobs the dirtiest jobs uh the the most
8:33:59
negative life outcomes are disproportionately men So yeah maybe
8:34:04
it's true that you don't get the the uh the c or what's it called The uh the the
8:34:11
corner window office at your company It's not even clear to me if like being a wage slave for some company is like
8:34:18
this big win But uh the worst negative
8:34:23
life outcomes it's almost always men So it's like you were saying that feminism
8:34:29
is like women's advocacy So we're all men and and also like trying to help men
8:34:35
as well just trying to make things better for majority of people And so women are coming together and we're
8:34:40
having conversations and we're explaining these grievances and we're usually voting things in to make this
8:34:46
change Whereas it sounds like men just want to maybe just complain about the
8:34:51
tasks they have to do in society And I get your grievances but like what do you
8:34:56
want us to do now that we're listening to them Uh I don't I don't want women to
8:35:02
demonize men I don't want women to view all men as predators I want I want I feel like that's a conversation you
8:35:07
should have with your fellow man as well But hold on Feminism is always like we
8:35:14
want men to acknowledge our grievances Yes And you want equality on that You
8:35:19
want to also be acknowledged in your grievances which is great Yeah Yeah This is good But I don't like once you play
8:35:26
open up this game of uh of grievance then we have to I think it's completely
8:35:33
fair for men to be like "Wait hold on You're saying that just by virtue of me being a man I'm so privileged and my
8:35:41
life must be so easy because I'm a man But the reality is is that's just it's
8:35:47
just not true whatsoever And this idea it's it's kind of this it's almost it is
8:35:52
sexist to just say well men are privileged Men just have privilege in comparison to what In totality of what
8:36:01
Like I think it's a privilege to not have a period every month I think it's a I think it's a privilege that the
8:36:07
majority of women in this country don't have their genitals mutilated upon birth And I think we can both have our
8:36:12
grievances but at the end of the day are you voting to make that change happen because like we can't vote to change
8:36:18
having periods but you could potentially talk to your fellow brethren about the
8:36:24
situation but instead you're like complaining to us and it's like what do you want us to we hear you and we have
8:36:30
empathy for you just like we want you to have empathy for us but at the end of the day like you have to talk to your
8:36:36
fellow man about that situation or else us too
8:36:41
This is this this conversation is actually what helps us a lot because when we hear that you guys wait we we're
8:36:46
like wait a minute like it blew my mind when I'm realizing that I had been programmed to believe that men didn't
8:36:52
have feelings and emotions I had to do a lot of work to realize that I was like oh I need to be more mindful of what I'm
8:36:58
telling someone especially with a partner and in a relationship like you do have thoughts and emotions and feelings and grievances and pain and
8:37:05
trauma and like and I watch that I've seen women destroy men and emasculate
8:37:10
and all that So it's like wait a minute women do have some work to do Now that we're at the table there should be some
8:37:16
solution We can keep going with the he said she said you do this I did that But I and but it is it is more like hey
8:37:21
there are grievances What's the solution Um men asking for help I don't identify
8:37:27
as misandress I have empathy and care for men in my life I have a relationship
8:37:33
with my boyfriend and it's very close and I understand his own grievances when it comes to being a man in our society I
8:37:39
do however have friends who are feminists who are misandress So I understand what you're saying where you know why would you be friends with a
8:37:44
misandress Well she has certain opinions but her overall she's a kind human being
8:37:50
Well you know she just has differences of opinions My friend's racist but uh and like hates this group this like you
8:37:57
probably have friends who are like ex like extreme extreme conservatives You don't have the same exact viewpoints as
8:38:02
them all the time Are you still friends with them Does she like identify as a misandroid I don't think I think some of
8:38:09
her takes maybe go a little too far I wouldn't say that like mainstream conservatives are sexist or rac or
8:38:17
racist really But it depends on who which people most I think most mainstream conservatives have pretty
8:38:23
reasonable takes on uh gender stuff and yeah but like once you cuz like you know
8:38:30
on both sides of the spectrum politically you can go too far on either way So it's like you probably have
8:38:35
friends who have opinions that are too far but you're still friends with them even though you don't agree
8:38:41
or maybe not Uh yeah sure I I'm definitely friends with people who have positions that I don't agree with I
8:38:46
don't think I I I don't know if I would be uh particularly inclined to be buddy
8:38:52
buddy with somebody who was like demonstrably like viciously racist or you know
8:38:58
something like that or like hated like if somebody women like hated women
8:39:04
blanketly like misogynist or do you not believe in that term Well I think the the term misogyny gets thrown around a
8:39:11
whole bunch uh where it doesn't necessarily apply Um but if somebody just blanket hated
8:39:19
women I I'm against that I don't think you should blanketly just hate women I
She is friends with a MISANDRIST?
8:39:25
think if they like hate that because of their experiences then I'm just like oh that's just a really like traumatized
8:39:32
unfortunate event type person Mhm And so they're like taking it out on that
8:39:38
specific gender And I feel like that's a similar conversation we're having where it's like you as men feel like unheard
8:39:44
You don't feel like you have the same I mean do you feel like as a man you don't
8:39:50
have the same opportunities as women like you do you feel oppressed
8:39:56
Is that the sense that you're getting from men nowadays The oppress the pressed word is a difficult one but uh
8:40:01
are you saying that in relation to opportunities Yeah Affirmative action Absolutely Okay Now granted I'm not in
8:40:09
the uh like professional corporate world so I can't speak to that I'm self-employed However what I can tell
8:40:15
you is I've had hundreds of men and I've there's there's been uh journalism on
8:40:21
this topic There's been investigation on this topic You look at what's going on in Hollywood I have a lot of friends
8:40:27
male friends white male friends in the entertainment industry in Hollywood And yeah there's been affir massive amounts
8:40:33
of affirmative action in the entertainment industry and in Hollywood where they're like "We only want to
8:40:39
hire," and I believe I don't know if it was the Oscars or the uh they're like "Look in order for your film to qualify
8:40:46
for I know there's incentives for diversity You need to have 40% or 50% of
8:40:51
this demograph you need some transgender people you need some black uh dwarf
8:40:57
lesbians you need whatever it is." And it it's just uh there's absolutely
8:41:02
affirmative action that's hurting men and hurting white people and specifically hurting white men I mean if
8:41:10
if they want to band together to start creating laws and get them passed and
8:41:15
like they have every right to do that Sorry what don't they have the right to to make laws and get things changed If
8:41:22
if that is such a cross to bear then like go ahead cuz that's what women had to do right No but hold on I'm I'm
8:41:28
literally addressing your argument You asked me uh are men or white people or white men losing out on specific
8:41:35
opportunities And if a firm and you're saying yeah if a if a if corporations either through their own internal
8:41:41
policies or there's there's like social pressure or whatever it is through DEI policies or affirmative action is like
8:41:49
you can't hire white men That would seem to that would seem to indicate to me
8:41:54
that yes white men are not being given opportunities I mean the same thing could be said for
8:42:01
women in the past and for people of color So it's like the reason that these things have changed is because there's
8:42:07
laws that have like started to create that change cuz people are voting them in So if it's such an issue for you guys
8:42:12
then like why not do the same thing Vote it in because we can't go backwards And I mean I hate but it's not even but if
8:42:19
there's enough of them who are upset and they want to vote it in then like you have every right to right Wait well hold
8:42:26
on but just to be clear So if you're you would be fine with a company only
8:42:31
wanting and this is their internal company policy only wanting to hire white men Personally I don't approve of
8:42:39
that messaging but if they're able to get it voted in like if it's if it's
8:42:44
hurting such a large group of people and they all collectively decided that they want this law to be now be put in to be
8:42:51
more inclusive towards them then they have every right to do that right Well California this was on the ballot a
8:42:58
couple years ago and I think it failed actually but they were trying to essentially get rid of I forget the
8:43:04
specific terminology Maybe somebody in the chat knows it was on the California ballot They were trying to undo
8:43:11
the somebody in the chat maybe help but basically they're trying to make it so that you could discriminate in hiring
8:43:19
practices But the discrimination that they wanted to do was discrimination towards hiring uh
8:43:27
minorities and women and discriminating uh in terms of being able to not hire
8:43:34
men or white men Wait that's dumb Did everyone get discriminated on on that
8:43:39
one What do you mean Sorry It sounded like you said discriminated minorities and white men
8:43:46
Huh I got a little confused It sounded like you said discriminated against Who's getting discriminated against There's positive discrimination So
8:43:52
discriminating the discriminating towards I want to hire black people That would be discrimination in their favor
8:44:00
right I thought discrimination just always meant that you are against Well
8:44:06
it depends on the phrasing but yeah you would in in other words you would be discriminating against white people or
8:44:11
white men or men And it didn't pass Great I believe I I don't recall the
8:44:18
outcome of it but my understanding is it did not pass Yeah Well I mean I look I I
8:44:23
I understand the overcorrection of things and I and now we're at the table going "All right there's an
8:44:28
overcorrection and there's a lot of people screaming How do we do it where the there's more of a meritocracy while also helping out identifying
8:44:35
confirmation bias or what's the familiarity bias?" Um how do you account for that How do you what's the again
8:44:42
what's the solution How do you Yeah sure Um hold on Uh
8:44:48
Moon you said women are oppressed in the USA How are women oppressed Oh uh didn't
8:44:54
you want to I think I did but you know kind of just goes back to like what she said I mean child birth periods Um oh
8:45:01
maybe you did By the way guys $30 TTS I'm going to let them come through here in just a moment Um and you also said
8:45:06
women do not have equal rights to men in the USA Can you explain that Equal rights Um I mean what So so or let me
8:45:13
ask you this What right does a man have that a woman doesn't Um you're going to scoff at this but
8:45:20
like the right to not have a child in some states especially if you get
8:45:26
pregnant and you do not want to carry that child Okay So abortion rights Yeah Your reproductive right We don't have
8:45:32
you know and I think you said something earlier I can't remember what it was when we were talking about like uh promiscuity and you were like well
8:45:38
basically my point is one man can get but let's talk about rights Let's talk about Yeah I mean that this goes back to
8:45:45
those reproductive rights Like one man can get a thousand women pregnant but a woman can only get pregnant one time a
8:45:52
year Like so a woman being promiscuous still does not equate to the social
8:45:58
damage of a promiscuous man If you're looking at their ability to just
8:46:03
procreate endlessly I mean you could knock up seven You can knock up in I mean as many times as you can you know
8:46:09
produce Each of those individual women would have to I assume be promiscuous in order to be knocked up by a like one guy
8:46:18
No to be knocked up by one guy How would she be promiscuous Well logically it could be the case that like this one guy
8:46:24
has managed to get in a short period of time seven virgin women pregnant I find
8:46:29
this kind of unlikely but why would they need to be virgins No I'm not saying they need I'm saying it's possible And
8:46:36
this would point to uh although some people would make the argument that a virgin woman just getting knocked up uh
8:46:44
they might consider that promiscuity but like given the low body count I don't know if I would necessarily categorize
8:46:50
it as promiscuity but probably if one guy is getting like seven different
8:46:56
women pregnant I think that would also point it would point to his promiscuity
8:47:01
it would also point to their promiscuity So like if a girl hadn't had a relationship in three years or a month
8:47:08
and she meets you and gets pregnant she's promiscuous Yes I'm I'm agreeing that in this scenario the seven women
8:47:14
that this one man or the seven women that this one man he's getting them all
8:47:19
pregnant they could all be virgins I think it's probably unlikely Oh yeah I
8:47:25
think that that's it is too So like then why does the value of promiscuity for women like why is it so high when we we
8:47:32
can't go out and get other people pregnant is there besides the abortion thing and that thing is there anything else in terms of rights
8:47:39
I'm going to just stick with those rights that men have that women don't Okay And then finally this is the final thing then the chats then we're out Uh
8:47:46
Gabby you said women are oppressed in the USA have Actually want to change my stance on that now that I thought about
8:47:52
it No one benefits from society these days No one does Everyone's a victim There we go The rich people are are the
8:47:59
only people benefiting from anything I [ __ ] with that All right Sweet So guys

8:50:42
earlier That was what was defeated Also child birth ain't [ __ ] compared to
8:50:48
rounds coming down range killing your friends and brothers Yeah I'll just pull this up really quickly just cuz it came
8:50:54
into the conversation earlier And uh All right It was a 2020 California Prop 16
8:51:01
Uh it was a failed California ballot proposition that appeared on the November 3rd 2020 general election
8:51:06
ballot asking California voters to amend the Constitution of California to repeal
8:51:11
Prop 209 from 1996 Proposition 209 excuse me Proposition 209 amended
8:51:18
the state constitution to prohibit government institutions from considering
8:51:24
race sex or ethnicity specifically in the areas of public employment public
8:51:30
contracting and public education Therefore Proposition 209 banned the use
8:51:35
of race and gender-based affirmative action in California's public sector and public university admissions Scroll down
8:51:42
Uh and then that was just right there Uh so it was it was pretty close Uh so yes
8:51:48
they wanted to uh they voted in favor of it No So it's a little confusing because
8:51:55
uh they basically said originally they're like you can't
8:52:02
consider race So like if the person's black this is back in 1996 if the person's black you can't use that
8:52:10
against them Or if they're woman you can't use that against them you can't discriminate on the basis of their race
8:52:16
or sex But then with Prop 16 what they're trying to do is they're trying to say "No we do want to be able to hire
8:52:24
people based on their race or sex but this typically dealt with
8:52:29
minority groups." So we said it's basically they wanted affirmative action Does that make sense It looked
8:52:36
like they wanted a repeal of affirmative action Uh no So I got you Yeah Affirmative
8:52:43
action was essentially disallowed Oh and they but they wanted to employ affirmative action but this meant they
8:52:49
wanted to allow for discrimination So the previous law said discrimination is
8:52:55
illegal but they wanted to allow discrimination Yeah But in a way that
8:53:01
they view discrimination as positive Sure Right I got you I see what you're saying with Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
8:53:06
Yeah And that happens all the time especially in California You have all those uh props and everything People get really confused on them cuz it's tricky
8:53:13
language Sure All right This is the final one It looks like Mar go home
