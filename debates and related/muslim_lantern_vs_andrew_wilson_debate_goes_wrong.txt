Title: Muslim Lantern VS Andrew Wilson Debate Goes Wrong
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z04nrStvWis

(0:00) like I told you on the phone when we were discussing this because of the sensitivity of how sensitive Muslims
(0:06) tend to be about this I need to be able to openly and freely speak exactly what it is that I think and why it is I'm
(0:12) making an argument if you take offense to that there's nothing I can do about that but I'm going to speak freely in
(0:18) this debate yeah okay so it's not uh speaking freely or not speaking freely
(0:24) you can speak freely academically mention facts mention sources mention evidences but insulting and speaking
(0:29) freely are two separate things yes but the problem the problem is is that these are subjective metrics and what you
(0:35) subjectively consider to be offensive I can't do anything about like I I couldn't I can't objectively note what
(0:42) would be considered offensive to a Muslim if I talk about Muhammad I can't I can't know what that would be oh I'll
(0:48) give you I'll give you a few examples for instance use uh cursing words cursing slurs uh make fun of uh the
(0:55) prophet's uh actions or behavior specifically make fun of his uh looks
(1:01) right uh these insinuations these types of things is what I'm talking about you want objectively talk about facts you're
(1:07) welcome to do that uh and I think you're a very smart person so to say that you're not able to distinguish between
(1:12) what is an insult and why is not I don't think that's that's really true I think you can I'm not talking about the
(1:17) Muslims who go get offended by anything you say I'm not that type of person but when you get uh insulting and malicious
(1:25) that's a very clear thing that we both know what it is and very clear and I'm not willing to concede that I'm clear on
(1:31) what that means because it is a subjective metric and what you may consider insulting towards your profit
(1:38) may not be what I consider to be an insult towards your profet so this is a subjective metric if there's anything I
(1:45) say which you take offense to that is not on me I'm not constrained by your religious tenants in order to have
(1:51) Interfaith dialogue I'm going to have to uh you know depend on reason and logic
(1:58) and and rhetoric and sometimes rhetoric to even have dialogue you must risk offense again I'm not talking about me
(2:05) personally and I give examples of what I mean by offense you you still say it's subjective and we kind of going in a
(2:11) circle but it's is subjective because okay now you're interrupt me and then interrupt you so that that should be also important in the discourse I would
(2:18) let you speak I don't mind but You' also allow me to speak and if we do in the discourse see uh constant interdictions
(2:25) and uh interjections and interruptions then uh we'll start timing the the discussion I believe that's very fair
(2:32) other than that like every single thing you're going to interrupt when I speak that's not going to happen trying to take control of the discussion something
(2:39) I can easily do too but it just becomes nobody is is interested in that no this
(2:44) is the thing here is an attempt of you trying to kind of make me do that but that's not how I do again uh the idea
(2:50) about the prophet Muhammad Alam is very important all right otherwise I cannot engage well let me well here's the thing
(2:56) I'm going to get into my opening statement here and if there if if I'm going to risk offense if it's offensive
(3:02) to you there's nothing I can do about that but I'm going to go ahead and get my opening statement before before we do
(3:07) opening statements um so let just do each topic 45 minutes uh ideally We Do
(3:12) It free flowing I don't really like the timing but if it gets uh if there's too much interrupting then we're going to have to do timing but ideally it seems
(3:19) like we're all on the same page that we're not going to do that um Muhammad Ali do do you want to be specific like
(3:25) what would you at what point where religiously would you have to to leave the call because it would be um we're
(3:31) not supposed to as a Muslim you're not supposed to engage in conversations where it's
(3:37) offensive yeah so uh for instance it's a very common thing where where you find Christians and atheists in generally
(3:43) using the word pedfile continuously uh making uh as I said slurs or just
(3:50) cursing words discusting individual but all of these things right just usual curing words that you would use towards
(3:56) the prophet which doesn't really add to the discussion right it doesn't improve anything to it doesn't add any input
(4:02) towards the discussion that we're having so what we're saying is criticisms that does not add to the discussion you want
(4:08) to have a talk about the discussion itself I talk about the actions the prophet did you want to describe this
(4:15) exact specific actions that's up to you as well which probably he would do that's fine but to add your own kind of
(4:21) insults with it and call him this and call him that and he was this and he was that and no to that extent then
(4:27) islamically I'm obliged it's not even look it's not even a choice right this is this is a Islamic tenant if the
(4:33) prophet or the religion is insulted I'm not allowed to be present in that place whether people like it or not that's a
(4:39) different story it's not like he's going to personally specifically try to hurt my feelings right even if he insults me
(4:44) I probably wouldn't care that's like it's going to I'm going to laugh at that but I'm not talking about that we're talking about a religious ten now which
(4:50) is to do with the prophet and I also hope that we keep like good discourse with one another because I'm not going to insult him so I hope that he doesn't
(4:57) do that with me as well specifically and personally no I made the agreement that I would not insult you personally and I
(5:03) most certainly will not um I I am going to dive into my opening statement if you
(5:09) consider it to be offensive there's nothing I can do about that but I would like to get to stop having the meta
(5:14) conversation I didn't make any agreement to whatever subjective metrics you might consider offensive I hope that it
(5:19) doesn't offend you but there's nothing I can do if it does so yeah that's fine
(5:25) and I didn't say you had an agreement we started talking so we can clarify this point right so we don't problems when we
(5:30) start discussing but there's some things for instance right like you say uh the word file for instance uh that has a
(5:38) distinct meaning and if it's a key point to an argument to make this claim and
(5:44) it's mapped on to reality I don't see how how that's risking offense to you if it's critical to the argument structure
(5:50) that I'm making this has a specific word it's a specific meaning to the word the
(5:56) meaning can specifically map on in this case to who this person is is I have no idea why I would not be able to use that
(6:02) language yeah you can you can use that language uh I personally disagree that this is the case that's therefore I
(6:08) consider it an insult that's a discussion maybe that we're having I don't know if it is or not but generally
(6:14) you can say that's an active pedophilia you don't necessarily have direct it specifically to the individual right I'm
(6:19) being reasonable with you here I'm not saying don't use the word at all you can say that it's an action of pedophilia that's it no problem you made your point
(6:26) and then I would respond to that by saying that it is not and then we can have the discussion uh you can avoid
(6:31) using it specifically directly at the prophet you know that and that's the only thing that I'm asking from a
(6:36) religious standpoint as I said this is just a religious stand and which is why I have to well I'll do I'll do what I can to uh mitigate from from your kind
(6:44) of preference here um that's that's the most that I'm going to promise to do I I
(6:50) appreciate that I you seem like a reasonable individual so I hope we will be able to have the discussion without
(6:56) the issue he said 45 minutes I don't know is that okay for you or yeah 45 minutes per topic or an hour per topic
(7:02) is fine with me I don't care either way whichever one you'd prefer Let's do let's do 45 each and uh Andrew does that
(7:07) sound uh does everything sound fair and also also his uh what he's saying about
(7:13) like you know too many times uh insulting or you know like bringing up that word is does that sound
(7:22) reasonable yeah yeah well yeah again I'm not my purpose here is not even to be
(7:28) insulting it's to give what I consider to be credible facts to the purpose of the statements and The Logical
(7:34) argumentation that I have formed and the and that's the purpose of the debate in order to have discourse because we're
(7:41) dealing World debates are about worldviews and paradigms and from my perspective Paradigm I do believe that
(7:48) this that there's problems here with the man that you consider to be a prophet
(7:54) that is part of my Paradigm it is part of your Paradigm that this is not true
(7:59) and I don't know how we can have a conversation about that without risking offence I don't even think it's possible
(8:05) but I will try to mitigate the offense if that's what the kind of the key issue is here that
(8:12) sounds fair to me yeah yeah yeah and and I'm talking about intentional insults and I'm not talking about things that I
(8:17) might personally subjectively find offensive this and that people generally would this what I'm talking about okay about the 45 minutes if we feel like we
(8:24) need more when we reach the 45 minute marks please let let us know because I think we may need more time I you need
(8:30) sources to read it might take longer time so if we do you're okay with increasing if we need to extend 15
(8:37) minutes then that there's no there's no problem okay all right so I'm good if you want to start your uh opening stat
(8:42) okay uh opening statement from Andrew Wilson yeah so I've tried to keep the opening statement uh somewhat concise
(8:48) that way I'm not Gish Galloping all over the place and that way my opponent can take a single point at a time I think
(8:55) that that's the fair way to do things I also have a visual demonstration here
(9:00) in regards to the idea of child brides and prepubescent sex of children my opponent has stated and I'm paraphrasing
(9:08) here I'm not saying that these are his exact words sex with a child is okay in a marriage context as long as it doesn't
(9:14) physically or psychologically damaged a child though he didn't use a specific word child I'm inserting this word
(9:21) because I think that under the criteria he presented it would qualify as a child
(9:27) though I don't think he owned the position instead to make claims the semantics were incorrect I'm ready to
(9:32) defend those semantics I have a clip here for proof that this is indeed what my opponent has said on this topic which
(9:39) I'm happy to send over as soon as the opening is done to give you an overview of the assert absurdity of this position
(9:46) Muslim Lantern and God logic were attempting to argue the position of sex with 9-year-olds in this case it's
(9:53) because God logic had brought up iasia uh I am confident that God logic
(9:59) considers Muhammad to be fic I am confident that this is true I'm not sure
(10:07) what age Muslim Lantern actually believes iasa to be however most Scholars I've read in classical sources
(10:13) Place her at about 9 years old it wouldn't really matter though if Muslim Lantern does or does not believe Aisha's
(10:20) age is this uh he does not need to stand by the idea that he believes that all I
(10:27) need is that he's on record saying that he believes the age of consent itself just based around puberty with no real
(10:33) clarification there as to what that means and we'll dive into that but let us begin with some visual examples of
(10:39) what this has to mean a prepubescent vaginal depth which I'm going to represent here with this
(10:47) socket it's about 2 in just so you understand this is the average depth of
(10:52) the vagina and a prepubescent girl and girls in early puberty which really doesn't stop until we reach the end of
(10:58) puberty it ends up being somewhere around 4.5 to 5.5 in I have the medical
(11:04) documentation to prove this the average Arab's penis is about 5.5 in I'm going
(11:10) to represent that here again we're just talking about
(11:16) averages I'm going to put these side by side so that you can understand the distinction here you see is 5.5 in you
(11:24) see this is 2 in okay to express what this looks like in
(11:31) comparison it's very important that you visually understand this in order for
(11:37) Muhammad who I think definitionally would be a to have done zero damage to
(11:44) iasia which is in conforming with the Muslim Lantern conditions of quote not
(11:50) hurting the girl in this case I would say Muhammad's penis would only be able to be roughly
(11:59) 1.8 in in order to not actually 1.8
(12:05) damage this woman 1.8
(12:11) in now the reason for that is because we have the medical documentation of what
(12:16) is vaginal tearing and what vaginal tearing would be inside the wife he was anywhere even close the averages would
(12:22) cause severe damage so we either have to conclude the damage threshold that ml is
(12:27) talking about here is much different than how ml presents it or that Muhammad
(12:32) had a way smaller than average P I'm willing to accept either correction to
(12:38) further demonstrate the truth of this claim you can find more info on this and the growth of the birth canal and adolescent girls uh this is done by
(12:46) Marisa lvll she's a PhD she goes further into why pregnancy at a young age is generally damaging to a woman but it's
(12:52) also demonstrating the physiology in the difference of canals and the difference in penis length the difference in
(12:59) vagina length when it comes to uh people engaging with child Brides she goes into
(13:06) various problems of the pelvis during child birth for prepubescent girls and
(13:11) here if you'll humor me I'm going to give you some highlights again trying to keep this
(13:16) somewhat brief um the size of the birth canal is
(13:21) smaller in the first three years even past the first age of the period Then at
(13:27) age 18 years old that's why we have a standard for this by the way people pretend it's arbitrary it's not
(13:33) arbitrary we have standards for a reason um if you even go by a region this is
(13:40) true basically all over the world this is true that prepubescent girls are still going through still going through
(13:47) puberty and so their canals are growing properly uh at 18 only minor differences
(13:53) are observable in the size of the birth canal this is important at 18 only minor
(13:59) differences are between women um in any way substantial in the birth canal uh
(14:06) although girls with early periods are appreciably shorter and heavier their late matching counterparts at this age
(14:12) there really is no distinct or huge variable difference it's why waiting
(14:18) until that age is usually a good idea uh she goes into the various problems of this now to be clear my job
(14:24) is to defend uh or I'm sorry to attack this position is job is to defend it okay um
(14:34) I I need you to understand that I'm not going to go with any
(14:41) whataboutism uh so if you say what about the Christians though it's IR relevant this is that is for me to defend in the
(14:47) next portion of the debate on the Trinity this is purely for him to defend the Islamic position on underage
(14:56) marriage it is not to do whataboutism it is not to to say what about the Christians though what about them over there though that's all logically
(15:03) fallacious argumentation designed specifically to offis scate away from the points which are being made which is
(15:09) the justification inside of the Islamic worldview for why it's okay to have sexual intercourse with girls as young
(15:15) as Seven 8 9 years old why that's okay why that's moral from their Paradigm I
(15:21) do not have to defend a paradigm here it's not important that I defend a paradigm here it's only important he defends his the Paradigm I'm defending
(15:28) is the Trinity in the next debate so he can ask whatever questions that he wants in regards to clarification on what it
(15:35) is that I'm asking him but it is not at all pertinent in any way shape or form
(15:41) whatever he thinks the Christian belief on this is that is not what I'm here to defend he is here to defend the Islamic
(15:48) Paradigm with that I'll yield my time okay Muslim Lan all right perfect amazing uh I love
(15:57) uh the the ending of his talk cuz it shows that how hypocritical Christians are he's trying to put a new condition
(16:03) that we didn't agree upon is oh you're not going to mention Christianity and that is not going to happen I'm going to mention Christianity to show how
(16:09) hypocritic no no Andrew Andrew we gave you five minutes uninterrupted this Christianity for you guys I didn't think
(16:15) a minute and he's already interrup but I think it's fair Andrew Andrew he gave he did give you five minutes uninterrupted
(16:20) it's it's completely fair for him to give his his time in his opening statement all right thank you for muting
(16:26) him because I didn't even speak that was him he muted himself all right so he
(16:31) muted himself okay same thing all right great now uh I'm going to start again what I was saying this is what we see
(16:37) Christians trying because they're running away they want to run away from the fact of all Christian history Church
(16:42) fathers what they believed about the age of marriage or the Bible says about the age of marriage instead of making this a Christian Islam versus Christianity
(16:48) which was the the the whole topic of the uh argument he's trying to make it now no no just speak about Islam no no this
(16:54) is the Islam versus Christianity thing people watching you are Christians they have Christians positions you might disagree you might shake your head
(17:00) that's irrelevant I'm going to mention the point anyways for the benefit of the viewers to see the hypocritical nature
(17:06) of the people who accuse the prophet of something that they themselves are doing now uh you mentioned few things which are I don't really need to deal with
(17:13) very very low blows trying to you know instigate some sort of a reaction with the measurements and stuff like that irrelevant not going to deal with that
(17:20) according to the Muslim beliefs were not uh prepubescent according to the
(17:25) agreement of Muslims that was not the case so all of your argument about the prepub and stuff doesn't work because
(17:31) that was not the case with in fact the prophet waited after he made a contract with her with her until she reached the
(17:37) age in which she was then uh past puberty essentially is what we
(17:43) believe as Muslims so your argument is irrelevant again I didn't even see an argument all you did is just you said
(17:48) Sciences one two three this is what we have with with Christians they don't present anything from their own faith
(17:54) they just like uh with all the respect speak speak speak empty speech about okay oh this is what happens when you
(17:59) have intercourse and this length and that lens where is the argument there is zero argument that was presented so uh
(18:05) on the other hand I'm going to present actual arguments now first uh morality is objective in the belief of both
(18:12) Muslims and Christians morality sources from the Creator in the belief of both Muslims and Christians so uh the reason
(18:18) this whole idea of the age of marriage not age of consent because Muslims don't have an idea of age of consent that's
(18:24) the Western concept we have the idea of age of marriage and Christians had the idea of age of marriage but uh it seems
(18:29) like is changing these days so this argument is not even an argument against Islam inap perform and highlight why
(18:36) first as I said morality is objective and it sources from God in order for you to claim something is morally incorrect
(18:43) morally wrong you need to prove your objective morality I.E Christianity in your case and this Pro that Islam
(18:49) doesn't have an objective morality and then which then we can talk is that specific actual uh intercourse that
(18:55) happens whether that be before or after puberty whether it is right or wrong where did you bring this objective moral
(19:01) CL claim as a Christian you should find that in the Bible so I will wait for you to present me with your lovely evidences
(19:08) from the biblical tradition and what is the morally age acceptable age for intercourse and if you cannot do that
(19:14) then you're just saying your own personal subjective moral opinion and we don't really care about that like just
(19:19) like anyone else's subjective moral opinion that's number one why this is not an argument against Islam because you've not proved your objective
(19:26) morality number two a Muslim can believe now we talked about me and my belief which I can highlight in a second talk
(19:32) about the points the things that I believe in my position but that's uh not what we're discussing now but I'll
(19:37) present it anyways it doesn't matter uh a Muslim can believe I'm talking a Muslim I'm not talking about myself now
(19:43) a Muslim can believe the age of AA was different than what we say contract at six and consummation at nine a Muslim
(19:49) can believe a different number why a Muslim can believe a different number and can still be a Muslim because this
(19:55) is not an Article of Faith issue we have six articles of Faith as Muslims number seven is not the age of we don't have
(20:01) that so uh an information about a prophet of the an information about the wife of the Prophet Alat is not
(20:09) essential to the belief and the Creed of a Muslim if he wanted to say okay I don't this specific report I believe it
(20:15) otherwise he's not going to be a non-muslim therefore it's not an argument against Islam you're arguing
(20:21) against something that is not a creedal issue in the Muslim faith to begin with so it's irrelevant uh it's irrelevant
(20:27) argument a losing debate from the beginning for you there are many Muslims who do believe or there are Muslims some Muslims who do believe otherwise that
(20:33) her age was not specifically that and they talk about how the ages the date of birth was not recorded as it is recorded
(20:39) today you didn't have hospitals and writing the names and this and that the so the numbers and the ages and the date
(20:44) of birth was not as accurate as it is today however I hold the position that she was six with the uh contract and
(20:52) nine with the conation that's my position but I'm making a more important point now which is that it is not
(20:57) arguing against Islam because I can still believe otherwise and be a Muslim and therefore that is not argue against
(21:02) the religion of Islam because you're attacking something is not a core Foundation the third reason that does not disqualify uh does not argument
(21:10) against Islam is because that does not disqualify Prophet Muhammad from being a prophet with the Christian biblical standards objective morality of
(21:16) Christianity you have prophets in the Old Testament sleeping with their own daughters you have prophets committing polytheism you have uh prophets killing
(21:23) and committing adult adultery and they'll still considered prophets of God according to the Christian narrative in
(21:28) fact you have Isaac and Rebecca Isaac marrying Rebecca at the age of 40 and she was three or all the way from 3 to
(21:34) 10 you can choose whichever one you like and I can demonstrate that with evidences if you like you're welcome to ask and I'll give you sources and
(21:40) reasons and evidences for that so we have already an example of someone who did that who was not uh debunked or uh
(21:47) criticized by God or corrected by God so in reality uh you don't have any objective source to claim that this
(21:53) specific action is wrong I'm waiting for that objective source which is should be the Bible or a divine Revelation in
(21:59) which morality sources from so that is the first thing that I'm going to say uh the second thing that I'm going to jump
(22:04) into is uh my specific position why is my specific position my specific
(22:10) position because you would like to know my specific position so I'll I'll make it concisely in points and then perhaps
(22:15) maybe I'll let you come in because I don't want to take a very very long uh segment okay my position is the
(22:20) following Islam allows uh marriage there is no sex or or intercourse or any of
(22:26) that before marriage so we don't have the idea of age of concept we have the idea of marriage does not allow
(22:31) intercourse before marriage as Christianity but people do not keep to that tent the second thing is a kid
(22:37) because you have not defined and I would like your definition of a the word p and the your definition of the word child
(22:43) and when is an act consider Pia is the exact specific age in which you would consider pedopilia and then you would
(22:48) give me the objective morality for why where you came with these numbers from right hopefully not just your subjective
(22:54) opinion so uh second thing a kid is someone who's under puberty and adult is someone who's gone through pu
(23:01) puberty uh in marriage in Islam it has to be with the agreement of the father there's something called the in Islam
(23:07) was the guardian of the girl and without his agreement any Mar marriage in Islam is void prophet he said there is no
(23:14) marriage without the agreement and the blessing of the i e the guardian in this case the father right so this is our
(23:21) position any marriage without the agreement of the father is void let's let Andrew respond I think there was a
(23:26) lot of points there um if you could wrap up this last one so we can let him respond all right I'll I'll make number
(23:32) four I've got like four and five I don't know if he wants all of them or not but I'll just make number four if there is
(23:37) any type of harm uh on both the husband or the wife the the marriage is Haram islamically any type of harm that is
(23:43) established with evidence is proof so if we were to accept and this is why I'm going to shatter his whole argument
(23:49) right now in a second if we were to accept his argument that there was a scientific harm on a specific age of a
(23:54) girl that we can establish then islamically that is Haram and not allowed and for you have no argument there okay I'll give him now uh the
(24:01) floor as they say okay so unfortunately we have to go back to the meta here for just a second have a meta conversation
(24:06) about the debate so the the the Trinity is a Christian doctrine it's not a Muslim Doctrine so I would be on defense
(24:14) for that portion so for me to say what about what Muslims believe though has nothing to do with the Trinity so
(24:21) because it has nothing to do with the trinity in good faith I would just simply defend the logical position of
(24:26) the Trinity what he's doing is engaging in I have to do what about isms in order
(24:31) to defend my worldview also even if I was immoral had no moral Paradigm whatsoever and completely didn't believe
(24:38) in any sort of higher power nor objective morality I could still be able to prove inconsistencies in your moral
(24:45) worldview sir so if it's inconsistent from your worldview and you Advocate that it is indeed moral I could still
(24:51) prove that without having any objective standard for morals at all why you understand that right you understand how
(24:57) debates work you have a proposition my job is to falsify the proposition I don't have to give you a counter
(25:03) proposition I don't have to give you a counter worldview totally unnecessary just like with the Trinity a secularist
(25:09) is able to falsify the Trinity just as well as an islamist is do you get that so can we have the
(25:16) debate now uh you'd like me to speak uh I disagree with with the Notions that you've made I've not made a proposition
(25:22) for you to review anyways I was just literally giving my position am go I didn't even finish it because of the
(25:28) time so I did not give a proposition you highlighting you've not highlighted inconsistencies you mention harm and
(25:33) I've already told you there's a general rule in Islam if there is harm it's not allowed Therefore your argument falls apart it's irrelevant so that's not an
(25:40) inconsistency that you've provided he talked about specifically about the prophet we have got into the debate yet
(25:45) I want you I need the agreement first that I don't that it's not necessary for me
(25:51) toal okay can you tell me why it would be necessary for me to have an objective moral stance or give you one in order to
(25:58) def inconsistencies or refute whether or not inside your own ideology this is permitted by your own logic can you
(26:04) explain that to me you know how logic Works yes I'm going to repeat myself again this is a debate between Muslims
(26:10) and Christians Islam and Christianity you're making a this is a debate on a specific proposition of the age of
(26:15) consent in Islam I was very specific about it okay now you're you're interrupting again allow you to speak
(26:20) you allow me to speak it's necessary for us to come to everyone who watches this and everyone who watches this I believe
(26:27) including the sneak who brought you for this discussion believes that this is Islam versus Christianity thing if it's
(26:32) not there is no point of having it the only reason I'm having this discussion you can't defend the position I respond do you like me to respond or you inter
(26:39) me resp made me responding the reason is very simple the only reason I'm having this discussion anyways is because we we
(26:44) have discussions about Islam with Christians we get the uh comment trolls in sneaker's community saying why don't
(26:51) you discuss or debate with someone who's knowledgeable so that's the whole reason we brought that as a brought you specifically as a representation of
(26:57) Christianity when I checked your Twitter you have Christian there so this is a Christian versus Muslim thing if it's not if you're an atheist as you said and
(27:03) you don't even understand the problem with being an atheist and argu for that position then your morality is subjective and if your morality is
(27:09) subjective then I can simply say I disagree with your subjective morality I don't need to convince you with anything
(27:15) if you're coming with objective morality and that is the position unless you disagree that morality sources from God you're making a moral CLA have objetive
(27:22) you can still have inconsistencies in objective listen still have you can
(27:28) still have inconsistencies even if you believe morality is objective logically age okay
(27:35) great so then all we need here is the proposition all we need here is a proposition that's it can you give us a
(27:41) single all I want is a proposition from you that just clarifies that the age of consent in Islam does not exist and that
(27:49) you're going to defend the age of consent and when it's appropriate to have SE with with uh you know people
(27:56) under the age of whatever uh that's all I need I just need the the prop from you and regardless of what my moral stance
(28:03) is you're on defense this portion of the debate you're defending your your worldview here I disagree I than say
(28:10) that this is a disagree uh I'll tell you now if you allow me to speak right interrupting me of speaking now uh this
(28:17) is not a defense attack this is a a discussion about the idea of the age of consent that's what I agreed upon I
(28:22) didn't agree I'm just going to be defending I'm going to my hands I'm going to timee my hands for you so you can my for you on the Trinity I'm not
(28:30) using any what on the Trinity it'll just be purely my theology purely what I
(28:36) believe you can purely attack it they'll be no what about Islam because I have a a proposition it's my job to defend that
(28:43) proposition in that debate it's your job here to defend this proposition in this debate do you understand that well thank
(28:50) you for telling me my job but you're not the one who dictates my job as I said that's how how logic Works sir how does
(28:56) logic work do you know how logic people speak right you got an issue like you feel like I'm going to say something
(29:02) tell me that you know how logic works all right I'm going to speak the way I want to speak the and say the way I want
(29:07) to say as I said you're allowed to show inconsistencies in the Muslim position I don't have any issues with that but to
(29:13) try to pretend I cannot talk about the Christian position it's just hypocritical I never agreed to that
(29:18) going and I'm not going you explain why that's hypocritical okay I'll ask you a question okay don't ask me a question
(29:24) explain why it's hypocritical I'm doing that with a question no no the question Pro it's hypocritical just tell me how
(29:29) it's hypocritical it does when when you respond to the question no it doesn't you tell me how it's hypocritical as
(29:36) using the Socratic method absent of position is ridiculous start first with
(29:42) telling me what's hypocritical about me asking you to defend your worldview Paradigm without me having to defend
(29:48) mine I'll do that okay I didn't say I cannot I didn't say I cannot defend my
(29:53) worldview I said I would like to represent the Christian hypocrisy that's something I would like to to do I don't
(29:58) need to do but I would like to to show all of these Christians to show all of these Christians to show all of these
(30:04) Christians how hypocritical they are when they criticize then do that when it's your turn it's your turn to attack which is
(30:10) during the Trinity Port why do you think I gave two portions why would I talk about age of cons in the Trinity that makes zero sense I'm not going to talk
(30:17) about the age of consist me ask you this let me let me just ask you this instead here's here's an actual you know you're
(30:22) not allowed to ask you said I'm not allowed to ask you you're not ask a question I'll just explain it to you all
(30:29) right there is zero reason zero none none nil why it is that you would ever
(30:36) need to use a whataboutism what about them over there to defend the things
(30:41) that you believe it's totally unnecessary to a debate in fact it's facius to do in a debate has nothing to
(30:48) do with what we're talking about we're talking only about this one thing which is the age of consent in Islam that is
(30:55) the debate has nothing to do with Christianity can you explain how that has a thing to do with Christianity one
(31:01) thing tell me how it has anything to do with Christianity all right I already done that but maybe you you're not listening
(31:08) first the only if the only word you know is what aboutism it doesn't help I've already explained when you mentions few
(31:14) things about Islam I responded from an Islamic Paradigm like about about the threes about all of that I responded
(31:20) from the Islamic I did not bring the Bible but I can see you scared that I'm going to bring the Bible and bring Church fathers and what Christians
(31:25) believe which is why I'm going to do it because you are afraid of people seeing what Christians have been engaging in
(31:31) for the last 2,000 years was to do with of con in Islam tell me
(31:38) that tell me that and and and if and if can't answer the question position I'm doing it right now and if the position
(31:44) of Christianity was that morality sources from God and the Bible shows
(31:49) that you can have intercourse with those people who are under the age that is not immoral and you cannot attack Muslims for something is not immoral for you it
(31:55) makes no sense it's like me saying I believe X is perfectly moral but you you cannot do it you for you it's immoral
(32:02) I'm going to attack you on that would be hypocritical first of all saying that
(32:08) somebody's are you so scared why are you so scared first of all saying someone's a Hypocrites an argument from hypocrisy still wouldn't prove your claim is true
(32:15) even if my claim was not that's one two two you're also engaging in a two qu or a two ququ fallacy what about you has
(32:23) nothing to do with the argument you're here to defend the age of consent of Islam now can you do that
(32:28) or can you not and I'm going to reclaim all 45 minutes because we've been having this meta conversation are you able to
(32:35) do that or are you not able to do that okay before you before you respond because this is uh now it seems like
(32:40) we're we're still um trying to figure out the stipulations the debate I I don't think it's worthwhile to to go
(32:46) back on the time but so I wasth sure I was under the the debate sure happen
(32:53) we're not going to go back on the time he just wants to before your SP muscle to engage in the debate yeah we're going
(32:59) back on the time yeah absolutely I'm not going let you cheat I'm not going to let you cheat oh you're the one cheating
(33:05) time made a conversation because you have said it's so sad really so sad
(33:10) really so sad what you're trying to do sad hold on hold on before you respond let's let's go back to the hold on
(33:15) Andrew Andrew Andrew logic let's stop uh let's stop the the cross talk for five seconds okay I I was under the
(33:22) impression that it was going to be Islam the Christian position versus the Islam position but if you if you don't there
(33:28) is a Christian position versus there's just the Christian position of the Trinity yeah we're we're going to get
(33:34) into that we'll get into that the can you let the host speak please can you let the host finish what he say the host
(33:40) just asked me a question no I wasn't asking a question he didn't he didn't ask you he just said he didn't ask you a
(33:45) question I wasn't asking a question but I want to establish that I think that U Muslim Lancer I'll ask you a question if
(33:51) you are okay um defending the age of contemp position of Islam um without you
(33:57) know are you okay with it not being aration just defending it and not
(34:02) talking about Christian is is that what you do do you want him to to not debate Islam without bringing up Christianity
(34:09) Andrew yeah well his job is to defend the Islamic position not to his what
(34:15) abou isms are meaningless to me I just want the defense of the Islamic position I'll give him the defense of the Trinity
(34:20) from the Christian position I won't bring up Islam at all it's totally irrelevant to the debate whether or not
(34:26) the Trinity is logical ill logical or whatever has nothing to do with Islam why would it ever have anything to do
(34:32) with Islam he never presented a case for why it would be that he would need to bring uh any Christian faith or any
(34:38) group any Hindu Faith any any Indian Faith any satanic Faith none of that
(34:44) would be necessary for him to demonstrate and defend his position on the age of consent you do you understand
(34:52) that Muslim Lantern or not all right so I'm going to speak uninterrupted as a allowed you to speak
(34:58) un uninterrupted that's what happens with Christians when you discuss with them they turn liberal they turn atheist oh I'm I'm atheist now please don't
(35:05) mention Christianity because if you mention you're going to expose my hypocrisy you're going to expose I'm accusing you of something that actually
(35:10) exists within Christianity so please please just talk about Islam Islam only no Christianity please so we're not
(35:16) going to do that we're not going to let you hide behind the bush we're not going to let you try to pretend as if this is
(35:21) just an Islam thing it's not in your portion you've made that condition upon yourself that you don't want to mention anything to do with the trinity in Islam
(35:27) there's no Trinity in Islam so there nothing to mention whether you want to mention or you don't want to mention that's up to you you want to bring
(35:32) verses of the Quran which you think the Trinity exists in you like to do that you're welcome to do that if you want to
(35:37) bring anything about the Trinity from Islamic point of view I'm more look I give you all the whole floor do it but to try to pretend I'm not going to bring
(35:44) because I have I have here a long history which I'm going to present because I was actually collecting it in
(35:50) the last few hours of uh Church fathers and their positions in the age of
(35:55) consent on the whole Christian history and the Bible uh age and uh position of
(36:01) the age of marriage and age of consent which shows and demonstrates that it in complete complete the complete hypocrisy
(36:08) of the Christians when they try to speak about the Muslim position of prophet Muhammad or any of that he mentioned certain points about Islam I've already
(36:13) responded from Islam position so I'm going to do two things I'm going to do what he's asking which is to respond why
(36:19) there is no inconsistency in the Muslim position number two I'm going to highlight that this is actually the Christian position whatever he's
(36:24) critiquing is his own position and he doesn't want me to do that because he's sced because he knows that's a fact and
(36:29) that's a reality which is why he's trying to hold me into speaking about this or that I didn't tell him to talk about this or that all the agreement was
(36:36) you talk about Islam in the way you want I'll just ask a simple simple question on the meta side of this before we
(36:42) reclaim the time and he ask I'm reclaiming the time because we haven't even had the debate I need to ask specifically why is it necessary for you
(36:49) to have a straw man or for you to bring up and a very simple answer to this would be great can you explain to me why
(36:57) it's actually necessary for you to point to any group other than your own to
(37:03) defend your group's position why is that actually necessary in a logical debate
(37:10) why again I said to you I'll say it simply I'm not saying I want you to respond to necessary that's what I want
(37:16) to say I didn't say it was necessary I said I would love I I said I would like to do that to highlight hypocrisy which
(37:24) is very important now you are asking me the question I'm responding to you making a moral argument I don't think
(37:29) you don't understand objective subjective moralities it seems like you don't you you coming and keep mentioning uh logic and FES but you don't
(37:35) understand a simple thing as that the age of consent or marriage or whatever it is if you want to claim something is
(37:40) immoral or moral you need to have an objective justification for that as I said and as Niko mentioned he was under
(37:46) the impression I believe all the viewers are that this is a Islam versus Christianity thing and he can do a poll and show how you're incorrect and that
(37:53) is the position of everyone watching this except yourself somehow so if this is an Islam is Christianity I I'm going
(37:59) to show the Christian position simply and you welcome to show the Islamic position critique it and show inconsistencies that I'm welcome to
(38:05) respond to that I'm not going to like allow now all of the hours I spent on bringing sources showing your Christian
(38:10) history and position I okay I'm not going to mention any of that that's not going to happen I'm going to mention what I want to mention about
(38:16) Christianity and in your portion in the Trinity you're welcome to mention whatever you want about Islam that's not
(38:21) strong man I disagree with you already I've already responded I'm sorry when was this debate ever discussed as being
(38:27) a debate on the age of consent in Christianity versus the age of consent in Islam it was specifically stated as
(38:33) the age of consent in Islam I was on the phone with you and you said you would do that
(38:40) debate I didn't say age of consent in Christianity and Islam I'm saying to you Christian versus Muslim thing so a
(38:46) Christianity has be the same thing that's the same thing I'm telling you how it's the same thing now Christianity
(38:52) has a position that position comes from where it comes from the Bible because Christians take their beliefs from the
(38:57) Bible Bible they take their Divine positions of morality from the Bible so if you want to make a moral
(39:02) claic perspective break I'm finish it now I'm finishing it now if you are
(39:07) going to argue for the age of consent from Andrew Wilson's perspective I'm not interested in that I'm interested in the
(39:13) Christian position because this is a discussion that is to do with two billion Muslims and two billion Christians it's not about you and me you might think you might have some egoism
(39:20) you might have some egoism you might have some egoism hold on let's not do the interruptions there's too many interruptions yeah you might think that
(39:27) you have some egoism and believe that like you're that important that everyone needs to listen to your subjective position to the debate dude I'm not
(39:34) interested no I agree for Islam Christianity I've said that three times show me where that was ever stated
(39:40) anywhere ever no no we're saying it now if you disagree with it saying it now oh you just going to make it up now because
(39:45) you have to use straw man for your argumentation I was under that impression sne was under that impression I responded multiple times telling you
(39:52) the whole point I'm discussing with you okay let me let me um let me step in
(39:58) let me step in I I have to admit like and I'm trying to be as Fair as possible the reason that I wanted to set this up
(40:03) is because uh your YouTube name is the paleo Christian if I'm not mistaken and your YouTube name is the Muslim Lantern
(40:09) so I was under the impression that it was going to if we're going to go in and argue the age of consent that it would come from a Christian perspective and a
(40:15) Muslim perspective that is the name of both of your channels and that's what I thought the it's not the name of my
(40:20) channel my my Twitter handle is Paleo Christ gone my channel is called The Crucible but that's why it says it on
(40:27) the Hat but on top of that just so you understand if you're if you're ever going to host debates in the future
(40:33) right basic this is just basic logic 101 he has a position he has a proposition he defends the position the proposition
(40:40) him ever stating anything about what some other group believes or some other proposition that's not his proposition
(40:46) always going to be irrelevant to a debate has nothing at all to do with the debate it's a what aboutism and all it
(40:52) does is drain the clock so that you can't ask your questions I would never do that to him on the Trinity never ever
(40:59) in a million years would I say oh what about the Muslim position for BL it has
(41:04) nothing to do with anything do you both Now understand that that is true we disagree with you and your Prof
(41:12) on what under what criteria could you ever disagree with this when you let me speak you'll know but when you interrupt
(41:17) me when I start saying you haven't made an argument you just prattle dude you do much you you just speak and interrupt
(41:24) with all the respect like you've not really present presented anything you've not even presented arum we're still we're having an argument we're having a
(41:30) meta argument about the debate because I need I need the terms to be clarified so
(41:35) we can actually have this debate okay what terms do you want to clarify what terms you want to clarify just just one
(41:40) second I want to say one thing and then you can ask him terms if you like in formal debates and people are welcome to
(41:46) go and watch that if you want to have a a formal debate a person has a time a person has a time there's a topic in
(41:51) your time you can talk about whatever you want related to that topic what he's trying to do here as I said is he's afraid of the position that I'm going to
(41:58) demonstrate and show a Christian position on the age of consent that he tries to criticize the Islam Islam and
(42:03) Muslims of believing whatever the number is so you can have time and you can speak about whatever you want to do and
(42:09) I speak about whatever I want to do if you don't like that then you're just whining and crying with all due respect about what I can speak about what I
(42:15) cannot speak about either have the discussion allow people to watch the discussion and listen to different
(42:20) points of views or not that's your position that that's up to you no marketed as a discussion or marketed as
(42:26) a debate I was told debate let's have a formal time then let's have a formal time you have your time I have my time no no no we specifically agreed not to
(42:32) have a formal time in this debate unless it get time in a debate unless it gets I
(42:38) said I said agreed to and by in the beginning you can rewind the video you can rewind the video I don't care what
(42:44) you said here we set it up before we got here so that we didn't set up anything we didn't set I'm sorry I'm sorry I
(42:50) could have sworn I got a phone call from sneo who said like to debate this guy and I gave my terms and conditions one
(42:57) was that there was no timer two that the Muslim age of consent was a topic that we would do that topic you agreed to
(43:03) that we're on that topic has nothing to do with Christianity that's just a way to eat up my time I need you to agree
(43:10) that inside of logical argumentation it is completely unnecessary under all
(43:16) under all World Views it's unnecessary for you to ever bring any any other
(43:22) group or whatever they think or whatever they believe in to you defending this position you have still not coherently
(43:29) stated why that is necessary just that you really really want to all right I'm not in the habit of
(43:36) repeating myself you just said the same thing you said and I'm not going to again repeat the same thing yeah well can you refute it can you tell me why
(43:41) it's necessary other than you just want to few times I've done it a few times I don't need to do it again okay well then
(43:46) I'm going to reset the clock and if you just bring up Christian I'm anytime you bring up anything other than that's not
(43:52) going to happen cut it off it's not going to happen well then well then we don't have terms for the debate dude the term I'll
(43:59) give you the terms and you see if you disagree you'll have your time I'll have my time you present your case I'll present my that's not what we agreed to
(44:05) this is this is all done under false pretenses though okay so that's it just shows how you're scared of of continuing
(44:10) this discussion I'm being very reasonable I'm saying I'm saying everyone has their own time he doesn't want to agree to that I know I know you
(44:16) feel like you're being refuted all du respect but it's okay you can have your time I can have my time refed you you can present canical argumentation you
(44:23) can present your argument I can present mine and it's as simple as that literally saying I must be forced into
(44:30) uh fallacious forms of argumentation where you're allowed to bring up things outside of the purview of the debate to
(44:36) waste time that's totally unfair across the board completely biased across the board nobody would ever agree to that in
(44:42) a real debate in a million [ __ ] years now can you explain why that's necessary why it is that when I defend the Trinity
(44:49) I'm not going to bring up anything other than the Trinity because that's what we're debating why is it that you cannot
(44:55) do the same thing here what would the position of have to do with the Muslim faith nothing nothing at all zero
(45:02) zilch yes or no okay if we don't want to keep wasting more time because I I don't want to reset the clock and and do this
(45:08) again uh then we shouldn't keep on discussing the terms of the debate and we should just get into the topic of conversation we have to have Clarity on
(45:14) the terms if we don't have Clarity on the terms we have no debate but we didn't establish that before that we
(45:20) didn't establish that he couldn't bring up Christianity that was never a point of discussion it was literally entailed
(45:26) so I'm sor the idea that that you say I want to debate the Trinity that is US debating
(45:33) this Christian idea of trinitarianism has zero to do and you can bring up and when we get to that topic Andrew youne
(45:40) let me finish let me finish it has zero to do with anything except the Trinity when I said I want to also debate the
(45:47) age of consent the Muslim age of consent that's literally what I said this was agreed to what in the world does that
(45:53) can you tell me sneo you the moderator what in the world does that have to do with Christianity can you explain that
(45:58) to me right but you can use that as an argument when we get to the topic of the Trinity you can go and bring up Islam if
(46:04) you want to ARG it's just F lacious time wasting if that's part of your argument then that's part of your point of is he
(46:09) going to defend the Muslim age of consent or is this going to be about what about them over there as well because it's not a debate that's some
(46:17) something else here's what this guy Andrew here's what this guy Andrew is trying to do he's trying to say look I've got no position I just want to
(46:23) attack that's what he's that's what he likes to do he thinks I'm going to allow need to have a position to attack he's
(46:29) trying to pretend as if him being a Christian does not have to represent the Christian position oh don't mention my
(46:35) position which is a Christian position even though this Islam versus Christianity just allow me to speak Islam please allow me to speak Islam
(46:42) don't speak about Christianity because totally lying what people are going to be shocked that's what you're doing
(46:48) brought brought a condition that we didn't agree upon in which I cannot mention Christianity never mention we did agree to it yes we did I was on the
(46:54) phone I want toate the Islamic Islamic age of consent you said I don't want to
(47:01) and I said okay well then I'm not doing the debate you said okay then I will and I said okay if you will my understanding
(47:06) is that's what you were going to defend that's a lot that's yes you did no you did say that okay
(47:12) I I'll tell you what I said you mentioned the age of consent I said that's the topic that you choose I'll choose the topic of the Trinity there
(47:19) was nothing in our discussion which was like few seconds by the way cuz I we were not talking directly we're talking through sneo there's nothing there's no
(47:26) terms there's no terms no I was not on the speaker when he was speaking the whole time with you when you claim that
(47:33) there's a condition that I cannot bring up Christianity that was never brought and sneak was just mentioned that to claim that this is the case it's just a
(47:39) lie you're trying to bring that up now and enforce it so you can try to pretend that you don't need to defend the
(47:44) Christian position which is not going to happen either you you're going to speak you're going to represent your position which is a Christian position as a
(47:50) Christian I'm going to represent Islam as as a Muslim or there's no point Muslim CH you're right then we don't
(47:55) have a debate because you don't understand the rules of debate or logical argumentation I'm not going to allow you to I'm not going to allow you
(48:01) to fallaciously use whataboutism over and over and over again has nothing to do with the Islamic age of consent you've never demonstrated why it has
(48:08) anything to do with the Islamic age of consent nothing you just want to because
(48:13) you want to eat up time by the way that's very low tier and honestly sir I'm going to do that in my time I'm not
(48:19) eating nothing let's have time I'll do for wasting my time with this low tier [ __ ] you're going to run away now
(48:25) right okay I have your time to debate why it is your Prophet
(48:31) I'm here to debate that exactly that's what you're going to resort to this is the thing I said you'll have your time that's what I said in my opening I said
(48:37) specifically that your prophet's a okay now you said you I said you'll have your time and I will have my time I can
(48:43) mention whatever I want in my time that's not eating up the time because this is my portion you're trying to use silly excuses I don't know if you even
(48:48) had formal debates have you have the anyone ever seen a foral debate where people have time where someone will join oh no no no don't talk about my religion
(48:55) in your portion of the time have rules sir don't do that you can't use falles inside of an informal debate you realize
(49:02) that let's let's have time and have a discussion if you don't want to do that we then what we'll do we'll reclaim the
(49:08) time 45 minutes on the age of consent let's start with this how big do you think that uh that your profits was
(49:16) about the average size of an Arab's penis this is not this is this is a
(49:21) waste of time like there's no point of disc time this is necessary show his character good it shows his character
(49:28) this is necessary to the conditionals of my argument shows how much he's crying he doesn't have a discussion
(49:34) time question in pertinent to the debate I'm asking him can you answer my
(49:39) question please okay but as the moderator it
(49:45) doesn't make sense and there's there's no debate that makes sense if you you can't attack a position without
(49:50) establishing your position you did your opening statement and you said that the you can you don't know what the you're
(49:56) talking about you have no idea what you're talking about zero no clue what
(50:01) the you're even talking about right can attack IM imaginary positions which is what he's doing essentially he doesn't
(50:06) even know my position he's just attacking imaginary or sorry the Muslim position I'm literally asking you an opening question right this second
(50:13) Andrew we're not going to continue this if if you can't be civil and and curse and do this stuff like especially if you're G to
(50:19) say we established in the beginning you've been this whole conversation we've been trying to talk about the things that were established again
(50:25) before this even started before I took down the timer you said that we weren't going to do the cursing and we weren't going to get un civil like
(50:32) this I'm not cursing do you understand that what cursing means no that's
(50:38) cursing not curse to curse somebody is to actually curse them he's saying the f
(50:43) word really sneo the f word that's too much I can't say I can't say the f word
(50:49) you can you can say what you want to say but this is it seems like this is a waste of I mentioned the prophet body
(50:56) part specifically for a reason and he exactly did what I said there's no point that has no relevance to the discussion
(51:02) uh but he would bring it Heen size has something to do with the relevancy of
(51:07) whether or not you're going to have sex with a with somebody who's not even reached puberty really I irrelevancy
(51:13) here is what I think because you you're unable to allow the other party to speak for long is you can have keep lying bro
(51:20) is you can have your time present your case I can have my time present my case we can do the same thing the top no I
(51:27) want you to answer actual questions I've been courteous enough with you to allow you to uh speak about your topic first I
(51:33) could have said let's talk about theity first keep refusing to answer and the reason you're doing that that is the
(51:38) reason you chose uh the topic this specific topic because what you want to do is to try to me not talk about not to
(51:45) talk no no no you're allowed to in the we'll do that when we'll have a
(51:50) crossfire before we have a crossfire you're welcome to have time you're welcome to have your time I'm welcome to have my time that's what we can do uh is
(51:58) we can follow the terms of the debate that we agreed to which was no time limit and you can answer my question
(52:04) does it stand to reason that's not the terms I agreed to that's not the terms I agreed to yes it was the terms you agreed to was to not have a Time debate
(52:11) don't lie no no no watching no that's not true that that hold on that's not true we said no hold up we said no
(52:17) timers back and forth but we did agree that it was going to be 45 minutes each discussion 45 minutes for agent consent
(52:23) 45 minutes for the Trinity yeah but we're talking about a timed debate he's talking about having a timer we
(52:28) specifically agreed not to have a timer because that's how you avoid questions oh I just want to avoid actually
(52:34) answering the question now answer my question please would you say it stands to reason that Muhammad probably had
(52:42) probably had about the average size of an Arab man yes or no do you think so or
(52:48) not to respond anyone can go back and Rewind the video and show you're lying
(52:54) actually someone can clip that because I know you guys have cult in which I said before we start before he started his
(52:59) opening statement I made it clear that if there was interruptions and it's going to be uncontrolled we can have
(53:05) each timing he never said I disagree with this oh this is not allowed you will the video and they going to show
(53:11) that but now he's crying now he's crying about it because he doesn't want me we the conditionals agree to before we ever
(53:16) did the debate you don't jump in the debate and then create new conditionals dummy that's not how it works we also we
(53:24) wer we said we wer insults either it's if it's true it is Christianity that's
(53:31) not an insult if it's true you agree with me there are dumb people in the world
(53:37) right right we said we weren't going to do the adum Texs Andrew it's not an ad
(53:43) hom if it's true now can you can you please answer my opening question can we actually get
(53:49) to the debate or can't we I made my position clear can I have
(53:55) time you can talk about you and then we can have a crossfire simple question then here's my
(54:01) simple question to you do you think that it stands to reason that Muhammad the
(54:06) prophet which you worship likely had an average size penis for an Arab man do you think that
(54:13) that's does that stand to reason can have our timings and then we
(54:20) can do the crossover not answering my question and I will respond to you once the timing is done and we go to
(54:26) crossover portion did okay I'm sorry are you refusing to
(54:33) answer any questions that I ask you no I'm refusing to let you as you think you're going to dictate the terms of
(54:39) this discussion that's not going to happen and I mentioned that to you in the beginning you might think you're smart
(54:44) people you dictated your own terms I dictated mine disag trying can you
(54:49) answer the question let's do the debate you have your time and speak I have my time can you tell me when I
(54:56) no you agreed to the terms before the debate which terms you agreed that this would not be a timed response debate but
(55:03) an open debate I know I mentioned in the beginning that if there is Interruption you can't change the terms when I get to
(55:09) the debate dude the whole point was that there's no time responses if there's Crossfire if there's interruptions we're
(55:14) going back like we could do the way we started debate was fine open statement and then Muscle Man by open statement we
(55:20) could we can go this way but no we're not going that way we're going to do what we agreed to do
(55:27) he's just trying to dictate the terms it's called dictating the terms when you lose when you lose you try to dictate
(55:32) the terms that's what you okay this is this is going in circles logic dude what are you talking lose we haven't even
(55:39) done a debate you won't even answer my opening question mentioning the word logic doesn't mean what you're saying is
(55:44) logical right I know you mentioned it a few times to try maybe really let me ask you a question let me ask you can you even name you're not going to ask me a
(55:51) question you're going to have your time I'm going to have my time three laws of logic can you even name three laws of logic can even name as I said as I said
(55:59) the law of noncontradiction the law of identity you want me to look you what's the third one what's the third I'm not
(56:05) going to be I'm not going to be falling into I'm not going to this is a such such a childish behavior which just
(56:11) demonstrates how childish you are I thought I expected more I'm sorry you can't I'm sorry you can't it's just a
(56:18) childish thing you know either you have your time I have my time or there's no point or you going to run you know are
(56:24) you going to answer my opening qu question or not so are you we now no
(56:29) we're not doing a timed response we're not doing timed we agreed not to do timed don't lie and say we did neither
(56:35) one of you should be doing that neither one of you should be lying and saying that you didn't agree to that because you definitely agreed to it we also
(56:43) agreed to not do the the insulting and atom Andrew um but this seems like it's going in circles here come on I call my
(56:50) friends all the time sneo okay we're not friends that's Christian his Christianity that's his Christianity
(56:56) Muslim lann and myself we're we're not we're not friends with you okay oh you guys are a bunch of Puritans now your
(57:01) Puritans can't you said the word no no you said you said in the beginning if you want to go on terms you did say in
(57:07) the beginning you weren't going to do this let's let's move on to the let me propose this as the moderator okay uh
(57:12) we're going in circles on the AG of consent we can return to this and it doesn't see it seems like we have more
(57:18) agreement upon the terms of the debate when it comes to the we're not going to do anything but the debate we came here to do man that's what I agreed to okay
(57:24) but we are we've been going in circles about 30 minutes if we can go to the Trinity maybe we return to the Agia getent afterwards is that okay I I would
(57:31) like I would like to finish I would like to actually do this debate and I'd like him to actually adhere to the terms that
(57:36) he agreed to which is why I laid him out so precisely no timing we agreed to that both of you agreed to it you can say
(57:42) you're not my friend that's great but don't lie because you both agreed to that and so we're here I ask him a
(57:47) simple question after we have this elongated meta conversation doesn't understand basic logical argumentation
(57:52) that's fine but I asked him a simple question he can't even answer the simple question that how's that good faith
(57:58) how's how can we have a debate if he won't defend his position let's highlight how he's Li openly lying over
(58:04) here and we can do that very simply you niik can on this uh screen bring the stream and go before his opening
(58:10) statement where I explicitly told him that if there will be interruptions and I explicitly mentioned that he's been
(58:15) interrupting multiple times there will be time so it can be fair now we you're welcome to do that right now sneo and
(58:21) show how this guy is lying to his teeth few times now and this is the the third or fourth five fifth time he does it
(58:26) I explicitly mentioned and he did not say oh we cannot do that because we were talking about the terms we were talking
(58:32) about talking about the prophet all of the we were talking about terms we were agreeing on terms before his opening statement but now he wants to pretend as
(58:39) if this was this was not the case that that's we that I came in and literally have marketed this multiple times on my
(58:45) broadcast it's an untime debate that's what we agreed to gave the conditionals for the debate why I took the debate I'm
(58:52) a logical debater I'm here to have a logical argument with you you're incapable of that you don't even
(58:57) understand the basic rules of argumentation you think I need to have a position in order to to completely
(59:02) eviscerate yours not even necessary you have a position here to defend I have a position here to defend you just refuse
(59:09) to engage in the debate you also are now refusing to answer basic questions because you want to have some time back
(59:14) and forth we never agreed to that ever it it it was never agreed to and I was
(59:20) even good faith enough to tone down the opening statement that I had for you because your virgin ear can't hear any
(59:27) you know criticism of your profit ridiculous so um that's say we're just
(59:35) I'm allowing him to exert his energy I'm not going to do that and keep repeating he's saying oh you don't know logic he asked me oh name three laws of logic and
(59:41) then he could oh law of excluded medle there you go these are the the three basic law
(59:48) finally tell you that you go what chat I don't have chat open such a lame I don't I'm not streaming how do I have chat
(59:54) open can't tell me you know you see what this chish Behavior man grow up I don't know how old you are when you honestly
(1:00:01) need to grow up a little bit you decided to change the terms when I get here yeah I'm understandably a little bit mythed by that you refuse to go by the terms
(1:00:08) that you agreed to you don't understand time all I didn't agree with that you did you did agree to that I
(1:00:15) said untime debate you said absolutely you did agree to that I don't know if sneo was going to tell the truth about it but you definitely agreed yeah but
(1:00:21) the the condition was unless it's started Crossfire interruptions then then we would do time cuz we assumed that it was going to be civil and we are
(1:00:27) not going to do ad H in the tax any such conditionals we said that in the beginning of the discussion play it you can play it you people are going to see
(1:00:35) are going to see debate we change the rules when you actually get to the debate debate didn't start yet we did
(1:00:40) have a question me and being fair we we said we we did say this in the beginning of the conversation um and because I
(1:00:46) care about the stream there's many people watching um we can I I'll propose this we could return to this because
(1:00:52) we're we're going in circles we cannot agree about the age of consent I propose
(1:00:57) we never had a debate on the age of consent there it's not that there's a lack of agreement or some agreement right but both parties are disagreeing
(1:01:04) both of this and move to the next part of the debate we haven't even done the first part of the debate he refuses to
(1:01:09) even answer a single question of mine not one he refuses he just outright refused
(1:01:15) to answer any questions I ask him he made an opening statement I made a rottal of his opening statement I never
(1:01:21) made an opening statement yet I was going to present my position and then made an opening statement what you talk
(1:01:27) muted for the entirety of it yeah that was a rebuttal first before I got into the portion where I talk about my
(1:01:34) position that's why five minutes which debate in the world do you have five minutes five minutes and then you get
(1:01:39) into Crossfire there's not no time to present anything so unless you've never debated in your life go please go ahead
(1:01:46) show me a debate in which there was five minutes five minutes and the rest of the discussion open fire of
(1:01:53) now oh yours EX you can see them actual actual debate on
(1:01:59) modern day debate thousands of them on modern day debate everyone has his time on modern day debate and after that they
(1:02:04) get into theal potion they have and then it's open how long is the opening
(1:02:10) statement 5 minutes it's about 5 minutes you're wrong go ahead no I'm not wrong I've been on many times disprove me show
(1:02:16) me an example go watch my debate on modern day debate with Skylar fiction it was two opening statement and then we went right into open dialogue I'm not
(1:02:23) talking about you I'm talking about actual other people who debate you you see with Daniel kikachu they do
(1:02:29) their opening statements and they go right into open dialogue 20 minutes 20 minutes they have 10 minutes for bottles
(1:02:34) then they have backup is not true people can people can see that on their own but anyways yeah they can go see it on their
(1:02:40) own you're lying through your teeth you have no idea what you're talking about sure sure they're going to do that on their own time as I said here this is
(1:02:45) the format that that I would agree with your format I don't agree with so it's as simple as that we're not going to
(1:02:51) have it your way because you you won't answer questions dude if you refuse to answer questions there is is no debate I
(1:02:57) the opening question I had for the debate you refused to answer you said no I want I want to have time responses I
(1:03:03) want you to answer my questions I'll tell you this you'll have your time I'll have my time I'll answer your questions
(1:03:08) no we're not we're not going to go back on the format of the debate we're not doing it I'm not going to get to then you're trying to escape the debate you
(1:03:14) trying to escape the debate you wanted me to answer your question to the terms you agree to the terms and then I'm offis skating by adhering to the terms
(1:03:21) okay makes you wanted me I already responded I didn't agree to that term of me not talking about you did agree to it
(1:03:26) I didn't agree to that you did yeah you did Li phone we were on the phone well I
(1:03:32) mean all I can do is go out hear your honesty yeah your own opinion right okay so that's
(1:03:40) you lie in Islam is it you just lied
(1:03:46) what you said was that there was no conversation before the debate where you didn't agree to is getting childish if
(1:03:51) he's not going to look it's over here it's past 1: p.m. not going to if we can't make an agreement I'm just going to I'm just going to end this this is
(1:03:57) this is not getting uh this is not this is not productive at all um I'll propose one more time like we can we can go to
(1:04:03) the Trinity or or we can just end this this said it's going nowhere being part
(1:04:09) of never had the first part of the debate we're definitely not going to have the second part if you guys won't even keep to the terms of what we agreed
(1:04:15) to no way okay uh appreciate you coming on
(1:04:25) all right
