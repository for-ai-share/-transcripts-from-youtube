Title: Andrew From The Crucible Heatedly Debates The Whole Panel

(0:00) four I'm gonna go live too yo what's up guys we are live apologies for coming late I had a pretty hectic day today but

(0:07) we got Andrew joining us for a little uh I don't know discussion or open Panel whatever it's going to go how you doing

(0:13) now good good so I thought I thought we were doing this uh panel tomorrow but um

(0:19) since I was already live tonight you have an open Panel going on I'm happy to take on any D gens from your chat or

(0:25) wherever who want to fight or argue about anything oh I got quite a few d-gens in my chat

(0:31) I'm sure yes you do you do have plenty your background looks totally different that's because I'm on my background

(0:37) camera that way I could stream to my channel and yours at the same time okay so okay so we can do one of two

(0:44) things we can just go right into the open Panel or we can um react to this

(0:50) entertain video that just came out and then do the open Panel let's just do

(0:56) the open Panel I don't give a [ __ ] about Tate oh you don't no he's going isn't he

(1:03) going to prison is he going to prison for trafficking kids our remains to be seen on not kids

(1:09) woman but uh yeah it's a I've been following the story pretty closely and this is a pretty bad

(1:16) video they came out about him yeah he traffics away he like traffics women or whatever

(1:22) well that's the accusation oh yeah I mean I get it it's an accusation but I'm just saying yeah I

(1:29) don't I don't care about Tate I don't think he's interesting yeah okay like for instance can you

(1:35) explain to me Alex why he does gay dancing what's the deal with the gay dancing he does gay Dancing Yeah look up Andrew

(1:41) Tate does gay dancing and play the video is it on YouTube or where yeah it's all over YouTube yeah I have not seen any

(1:49) gear dancing around by the way much like John tranthony can you explain why it is that this guy Tate came out

(1:57) and said that he would rather have sex with a dude who looked like a hot woman

(2:03) rather than have sex with an ugly woman that's pretty awesome I don't want to get into the whole John Anthony thing

(2:08) unless I'll be sued again but uh we can take a look at the entertain thing okay Andrew take gay dancing when you hire

(2:14) the bottom G oh I guess

(2:19) is this what kind of car you want to drive Bugatti and what you want to do in life

(2:25) Logan we're asked to agitate dancing I've changed my mind about education and

(2:30) I'll tell you why this guy can dance his ass off look at this that is not him

(2:35) he's destroying it and no one's even saying anything about it is that really

(2:41) him though no it's not him dude okay that's what I figured just though

(2:46) we're just talking [ __ ] even Ross meets the fake Andrew Tate kind of does look like them a little bit

(2:55) I thought for a second you were serious and there's a gay entertained whatever dancing

(3:00) I mean it's funny though yeah it won't surprise me have you seen

(3:06) the have you seen the modern gay uh photos of Tate

(3:11) no no no uh you know uh Myron from fresh and fit no well I mean I know who he is

(3:17) but there's like photos there's a bunch of photos and compilations of him like hugging guys and laying down a bed with guys and like just doing like really so

(3:24) [ __ ] that's [ __ ] gross dude all right let me see if I can find it

(3:31) Myron hey whatever

(3:37) okay here it is I'm not making any claims I'm just

(3:43) saying this video looks a little uh iffy to me okay

(3:48) uh all photos of Mark kissing men go viral okay

(3:55) oh what's up guys welcome boys with the laughing emoji the post goes on to say here is

(4:03) I don't know how to pronounce Smart's name dog I've this caption says

(4:09) I mean Rabbit Hole keeps getting deeper with Myron Gaines AKA guys I I tried my best before I'm not

(4:16) gonna try to pronounce that name from fresh and fit podcast this is one of my

(4:21) favorite picks statistics with facts so mindless insults like you are gay or

(4:28) you're hurt or who hurt you are you there's a few more but you see two of them there uh the first one is like all

(4:36) right you know whatever maybe suddenly bro moment but on the bed that's uh I don't know it's a little weird I don't

(4:42) feel like straight people do that yeah it's it's gay and a half naked dude is laying on you

(4:50) and hugging you you're gay but maybe he just randomly fell on you

(4:55) like maybe he was so drunk that he thought you were a girl and he like there could be a plausible potentially

(5:00) straight explanation for this yeah here's a plausible explanation for it he's [ __ ] gay

(5:07) that sounds pretty plausible to me that if you lay it into bed and a shirtless dude is hugging you that you're gay Alex

(5:14) well there are a lot of gay dudes in the master who pretend to be straight so yes yes there are isn't that interesting how

(5:21) many of them there are there's quite a few um yeah I'm trying to think of how many

(5:27) I can I name uh I would put my money on the Qantas even though I have no proof of that uh

(5:36) give me the ones that you're thinking of well I mean first of all Fuentes isn't in the manusphere because you can't be

(5:43) an incel you can't be an incel who refuses to touch women because you're homosexual and be in the manuscript

(5:49) that's not that's not how that works right yeah well ironically unfortunately half

(5:55) the people in the master are actually in cells um no no no no but not the LARPing kind

(6:00) so you got the LARPing kind of incel who's like yeah what's that

(6:07) looks like 90 of the manosphere is a lower person yeah the LARPing in cell and then you have the actual in cells

(6:13) right like they're they're and he's a LARPing in cell so he's just he's just like funny about it

(6:20) uh we got a first person backstage Peter yo what's up uh can you

(6:27) turn your camera on Backstage so I know you're real we had a recent dick flash uh situation so trying to be careful

(6:39) you don't have to keep your camera on when you're on the stream you just need to turn it on uh backstage

(6:48) oh yeah Jack Murphy's pretty bad yeah Jack Murphy yeah that's one

(6:53) he's a total [ __ ] that guy yeah he wrote some article where he was

(7:01) talking about how great it is to have like your girlfriend get [ __ ] by other dudes while he's like doing man things

(7:08) so gross dude what is wrong what's wrong with you [ __ ] djans why do you do all this [ __ ] it's gross nope don't put me

(7:14) in the same category dude I don't have my girlfriend get [ __ ] by other dudes while I do a [ __ ]

(7:20) yeah I would say Stephen Crowder probably my opinion is also in that category even though he's not in the

(7:25) manosphere but he's kind of like trackon no that guy's gay too that guy's gay too

(7:31) for sure that guy is gay yeah then he recently come out and say he was gay no

(7:37) but I think he did I think he said something along those lines that he did gay stuff or some [ __ ]

(7:44) uh an article came out that basically and this was verified by the newspaper that uh he had a habit of showing his

(7:51) dick to employees male employees uh repeatedly over and over again uh

(7:57) through photos through like real life so it was like apparently a good day at the office if Stephen was showing her his

(8:02) take because the man he was in a good mood but if he didn't show you his dick and then he's in a bad mood and then like you know you could get yelled at or

(8:08) fired good God okay so Alex I got a couple of questions for you that my chat wants to know about and I kind of want

(8:14) to know the answers too so what's the deal with the nose what happened with the nose dude I broke my nose when I was 16. uh I

(8:22) don't know me and my cousin were just like [ __ ] around and uh I did something that pissed him off and he like he wasn't trying to like actually

(8:28) hurt me but we were wrestling and I hit my nose against the steel bench and it completely like broke it

(8:34) well how come they didn't set it right um I did have an operation done like a month later he just uh I guess the way

(8:40) the doctor explained to me is that scar tissue can pull it in any direction so it was a lot worse before I had the

(8:45) operation done uh but yeah just Scar Tissue I could probably I could probably

(8:51) do another operation if I want so I just don't give a [ __ ] and then the second thing that I was wondering is why do you

(8:56) always have your face right up to the camera because I have bad vision well did you get [ __ ] glasses

(9:03) I do have glosses but I look really I don't want to put all my glasses while I do a live stream but wouldn't that make you look

(9:10) sophisticated no it just kind of makes me look nerdy yeah

(9:16) uh yeah I I don't know man I'm gonna do LASIK in the very near future so until

(9:22) then people are gonna have to deal with uh my face close to the camera or those were those the two big questions

(9:29) yeah I don't know I'm sure that they'll ask me more too you got these panel guys coming on so that we can [ __ ] with them or what I dropped the link there was

(9:36) this one dude backstage by then as soon as I said turn your camera on uh backstage he dipped so yeah he just

(9:43) wanted to [ __ ] the stream up for sure where's that uh where's that punk ass mod you have who's always talking [ __ ]

(9:49) to me every time I'm in your chat punk ass little [ __ ] mod who's always talking [ __ ] about me inside your chat

(9:56) um where's that guy at tell him to come on here um you could be talking about any number

(10:03) of people I think you're talking about Greg I don't know who you're talking to him every single time I'm on your channel

(10:10) the guy is always [ __ ] going going crazy tells [ __ ] he has to come on here well you know I like Greg but uh Greg if

(10:16) you want to come on feel free and she wants to have a little discussion with you I guess yeah Greg you're always talking [ __ ] about how I'm a terrible

(10:23) debater and I did this and I'm that why don't you come on here and prove to everybody how awful I am and how based

(10:28) you are Alex thoughts on circus self-admitting to eight Lake out I don't obsess with

(10:34) you guys and you can see how they can but I expect 100 from someone who talks on that okay I don't

(10:39) he constantly talks about how he's sleeping with models so how would he have a late count of eight there's something something here feels

(10:46) off he's like repeatedly constantly talk about models like oh I was just

(10:51) finishing up with a model oh I was just having sex with the model so one of those statements has to be a lie

(10:57) um I don't know I don't really have I don't know Dirk is a [ __ ] lunatic a cocaine a cocaine dipping [ __ ] Looney

(11:03) Tune dude have you ever debated him no he refuses does he yeah

(11:10) oh that's a shame yeah he did uh he came on my channel twice and then the second time he said he doesn't want to come on

(11:16) anymore because I'm not a true red pillar I'm too much of a fence sitter yeah that sounds like zurica

(11:22) yeah so I guess he doesn't like the fact that I had like my own opinion on [ __ ]

(11:28) that was uh yeah I don't know I like the dude but uh yeah it was weird that he

(11:33) took that against me zerka says eat late Cowboy over 100 head count he said many he doesn't like to have sex

(11:40) he doesn't like to have sex okay who gives a [ __ ] about zerka bring

(11:45) that [ __ ] ass Greg on here there there's trolling one says eight lake house oh yeah I mean I do I don't know what the [ __ ] Greg is doing he might be

(11:51) busy doing [ __ ] uh who wins a debate between Greg and Andrew here I'll text them and see if he wants to come on yeah

(12:40) [Music] so is Andrew looking for like someone to

(12:45) debate yeah Andrew's Andrew is like a [ __ ] um I'm just over here to crash the Q a yeah he's like a live

(12:53) who hasn't been fed in like two weeks so he's just looking for a piece of meat the uh monogamous Gateway

(13:01) like a purely heterosexual piece of music I feel like I feel like you're

(13:07) backtracking made that worse Alec I don't feel like it made it better but anyway what's up Dennis

(13:14) I'm chilling I'm I'm kind of a fan Andrew you know I like what you're doing like you're you're putting Alex in his

(13:22) place you know it's good for Alex

(13:27) good for Alex yeah what do you think what do you think

(13:32) about this [ __ ] ass mod who's always [ __ ] with me in the chat dude Greg yeah he he has a big mouth you know like

(13:40) I agree he um he has a lot of enemies he makes a lot of enemies all right one of those [ __ ] ass come

(13:46) on the stream tell this [ __ ] I have no idea this was happening he had zero

(13:51) awarded well what does he need does he need an invite with balloons do we need to send

(13:56) him an invite those balloons and say come to the party pal or what people the human being like [ __ ] lives how is it

(14:01) every [ __ ] time I'm on the channel this [ __ ] happens to be there running his mouth talking all kinds of [ __ ] but the time that I'm on here in an

(14:08) open Panel he'd know where to be found it's amazing I'm sure he would debate you though uh I

(14:15) texted him so we'll see what happens all right Peter I see you backstage once again so once again I need you to uh

(14:21) turn your camera on Backstage uh I won't bring you on until uh you turn it off and leave it on

(14:29) just in case it's on a cycle leave it on for a minute or two

(14:37) so Andrew you think there should be like enforced monogamy I see you Peter you're

(14:43) good no no no

(14:49) no you couldn't enforce it was like non-enforceable how would you change the current situation I'd repeal

(14:57) the 19th Amendment so that women could no longer vote that would be step one and then steps yes I'm serious and then

(15:05) step two is I would get rid of no fault divorce foreign things would definitely agree on that

(15:11) all right let's bring on we do agree on that we do agree on that oh [ __ ] sorry I don't know if they're trying to stay Anonymous so uh if you

(15:19) want to keep your camera on keep it on but if you're trying to turn it off I'll give you a minute oh it was a [ __ ] flasher he put He

(15:26) decided he's playing a portal backstage what a [ __ ] loser it's always here I'm gonna ban him from

(15:33) the studio and it's always these portals are never like a guy [ __ ] a chick it's always like some big black guy

(15:38) jerking off well buddy we didn't flat he didn't get it though he wasn't able to he didn't pull it off

(15:44) he didn't pull it off he [ __ ] up dude what a [ __ ] loser man I cannot stand people like that

(15:51) uh yeah Greg uh I guess uh Andrew is a little uh upset with you so he wants to

(15:57) uh not debate you I guess but to be fair I did what I what I said

(16:03) specifically Greg is that you're a stupid little [ __ ] she's always talking [ __ ] in your in this [ __ ] chat I want

(16:09) to know what your problem is and I want you to come on here and tell me what your [ __ ] problem is that's what I want

(16:14) Greg and you're gay also I wanted to throw

(16:20) that out there too just I didn't want there to be any confusion about how I feel about you Greg so um very strong

(16:26) Felix against Greg was it just because he like talked [ __ ] about you a little bit in the chat a few times yeah he's just always talking [ __ ] [ __ ] and I'm

(16:33) like I want to know what his problem is never has a position never has a critique of any of my arguments he's

(16:38) just always talking [ __ ] [ __ ] I want to know what his issue is

(16:44) so Andrew Alex like hangs out with Destiny sometimes and Destiny is like

(16:49) bisexual yeah like a [ __ ] gross DJ yeah like don't you think that's a little like suspect like why is he

(16:56) hanging out with gay people you know does he hang out with Destiny IRL because I'm Gonna Catch I'm gonna catch

(17:02) his bisexuality it's like a virus right then wait wait a second wait a second Alex are you hanging out with him IRL

(17:07) bro I've hung out with him like two or three times yeah well I mean is he tall enough to you know reach your spot

(17:14) you know what they say birds almost rather flock together like oh listen Andrew's been chatting with

(17:22) Destiny way before I was so uh I don't go like hanging out with him IRL I don't hang out with the IRL I debate

(17:28) with the guy online like I do all djans he's a good dude I like him like when are you gonna come out of the closet

(17:35) Alex that's that's how it works that's how it works Dennis if you have a friend who's

(17:40) bisexual then you must also be bisexual like can we get some proud

(17:46) he's some genius uh give me some crowds for Dennis he's based give me this uh logic right there

(17:52) you don't think birds of a feather flock together Alex like come on yeah Alex you

(17:57) see woodpeckers hanging out with bluebirds Alex no you don't see woodpeckers hanging out with bluebirds if you hung out with me then wouldn't

(18:04) that make you gay too but all I'm saying is that if you're around a bad influence

(18:11) according to this Theory you and I can never meet up because you might catch the gay yeah I'm staying I'm staying in

(18:18) Chicago like in Chicago yeah you're smart man smart man Dennis you gotta

(18:23) watch out for the gay man I'm sorry but all I'm saying is that like you know if you're around a bad influence like

(18:29) eventually you're gonna get tempted you know so I'm just saying watch out and you know you know how Okay Destiny's

(18:36) like jerking off huge in front of me like what do you think we do I I think Destiny would definitely like try to

(18:42) trick you like

(18:52) that's why the channel is called playing with fire

(18:59) the funny thing is Dennis actually said something that's pretty sus which is that you might get tempted if you're

(19:05) straight I said if you're around a bad influence

(19:10) long enough you know like if you hang out with drug addicts you're gonna become one you know like if you hang out

(19:16) with alcoholics you're eventually going to become an alcoholic so if I hang out with you will I become a magician

(19:22) yeah did you watch that video hang on hang on if you did hang out with him long enough you a magician don't you

(19:30) think he'd pick up a magic trick or two

(19:40) and put them back together teach that to Andrew he'll just delete

(19:46) just leave out the second part I went out last night and I filmed some

(19:51) like dope videos so I'm gonna have to release them on my channel nice uh yeah I didn't know I did okay

(20:00) Greg I think people are saying he wants to come on so I dropped the lane Greg There's the link yeah Greg come on Greg

(20:06) foreign the funny thing also is like when people

(20:14) uh like ask me about Andrew they're like yo isn't Andrew dick I'm like you know what Andrew's like one of the nicest people off camera like and like No One

(20:21) Believes In Me at all people are like yeah yeah I'm like no he's like a really really nice person just he has like

(20:27) split personality disorder when he's on camera he puts on this like [ __ ] Persona of like a total [ __ ] [ __ ]

(20:34) but off camera he's like a really nice guy you saw that Super Chat Alex

(20:41) uh so what about going on there with someone and they got trannied or whatever

(20:46) yeah yeah that sucks I mean I don't know what to say it was rough I guess

(20:53) um that's why I prefer shorter girls less likely to happen Alex over here [ __ ] giving away my

(21:00) secrets and [ __ ] brick sorry about that buddy

(21:07) Andrew's horrible off camera he's even worse he calls me at like 4am just to wake me

(21:13) up and then I'll be like what's up dude he'd be like nothing and you can hear me beating my wife and kids in the background

(21:19) I just want to FaceTime you while I beat the [ __ ] out

(21:25) I'll be like okay yeah all right guys link has dropped so uh

(21:31) yeah I'll drop it again I guess

(21:39) okay Pence principal Greg uh Greg can you please turn on your camera backstage

(21:45) we had to dig flashing okay I see you all right you're good buddy oh cool yo Andrew I heard you're talking [ __ ]

(21:50) what's up my man well I said you're a [ __ ] and you're always talking [ __ ] in your chat can we see those receipts that

(21:56) you promised us not the that's principle the girl's trying to slide in your DMs we still haven't seen any receipts from

(22:03) you Andrew so why do I need it okay but you said you had receipts yeah that doesn't mean I'm gonna have receipts

(22:09) yeah well I'm not going to provide any receipts of girls trying to get I'm not gonna no require doctors

(22:15) and then you can't even show receipts for yourself why do I why do I need to show anything because you said you had

(22:21) receipts that that so you don't think that an online personality like me has women who proposition them is that what

(22:27) you're saying absolutely not no I don't okay and the only way that you'll believe that is if I show your receipts that

(22:33) that's true yes receipts that don't involve you explaining the Pence principle to women I want to see women

(22:39) specifically yeah but I explained the Pence principle to all of these women who contact me yeah but does that mean which is not like an innumerable amount

(22:45) there's been a few yeah does that mean that they're sexually interested in you if I'm explaining to them the Pence rule

(22:50) yeah the guy gets their pennies wet right that you just you know the Pence principle up and down

(22:56) no that's me rebuffing them so but how does that show that they're trying to get with you because they will

(23:03) say things before I tell them that I follow the Pence principle what kind of things will they send to you or say to you I guess well sometimes you're

(23:09) overtly sexual sometimes not just flirtatious can you show us any proof of the overly sexual things that they send

(23:16) to you I could but that would that would literally require me doxing these people how why can't you just blur out their

(23:22) face and name well I could blur out their face and name but why don't you answer through that shut up and let me finish

(23:31) I was not prepared to walk on the stream though and have that ready for you well that's another thing I didn't know that

(23:37) uh you had my name in your mouth I was summoned well all you do is all you do is talk [ __ ] yeah and I can back my [ __ ]

(23:43) up I've showed me so let's say so let's say for a second let's just hand it to you and say there's not a single woman

(23:48) who's ever contacted me to proposition me not even one time what are your other criticisms uh the you talk massive [ __ ]

(23:56) you say that I talk massive [ __ ] I think you talk massive [ __ ] too okay what what's the criticism the criticism is

(24:02) anyone that doesn't believe in Jesus Christ you think is a degenerate there we go so now we're getting to what your

(24:08) actual problem is so I do think that definitionally they're degenerates why wouldn't they be so you think everyone

(24:14) that watches playing with fire is a degenerate no and everybody that watches with playing with fire is not an atheist

(24:20) okay but what what's your criticism with like some of the playing with fire fans because I hear you call a lot of guys degenerates

(24:27) they're definitionally degenerates I don't have any problem with them personally no I mean why do you think

(24:32) they're degenerates because they don't follow the teachings of Jesus Christ so they're they're engaged in sexual sin

(24:38) which would be degeneracy degeneracy just means without morals or no moral justification some men that like to

(24:44) engage in casual sex you consider them degenerates right yeah that would they would definitionally be degenerates it means

(24:51) without morals you understand that that's what I understand that it's just that so repeat it back to me repeat it

(24:57) back to me so you don't know what it means take orders from someone that has repeatedly

(25:03) repeat it no case to me right now that you're sponsored by what do you smoke marbros Newports what kind of cigarettes

(25:09) you smoke what does that have to do with anything well because I'm trying to see if you're actually sponsored by that company

(25:15) because you smoke a lot of cigarettes Andrew yes I like to smoke cigarettes why would that be nice do you uh take to

(25:20) the doctor per year none none I've been in the doctrine you're about your health at all you wait whoa okay okay we got a

(25:27) rewind you haven't been to the doctor in years why do you not go to the doctor protecting him yeah well I need to go to

(25:34) the doctor for you don't get your test levels checked

(25:40) testosterone levels test is a slang term so you don't know your own testosterone levels why would I give a [ __ ] uh you

(25:47) should give a [ __ ] because that has to do with how you feel like I feel I feel fine what are you talking about if you

(25:53) haven't gotten tests you could have heart disease you'll find because Jesus Christ has a room for you

(25:59) right no no let me ask you this again you just asked me how do I know if I feel fine yes okay but I'm saying what

(26:06) else would know how I feel except me stupid uh the doctors that check your doctors are going to know how I feel

(26:12) better than I know how I feel stupid okay so you don't yeah it's stupid how [ __ ] dumb are you bro how dumb are

(26:18) you apparently I'm pretty dumb since yeah apparently you are pretty dumb yeah and and I don't smoke hamster sticks for

(26:24) a living right I was getting heated fast what does that have to do like Andrew is a little triggered I mean I don't know I'm I'm sure what what does me smoking

(26:31) have to do with anything when was the last time you actually went to the doctor like do you even remember that I

(26:36) don't know maybe a couple years ago maybe and what made you not want to come back did he like do something that you

(26:41) didn't like he just you know yeah he charged me too much money okay so you don't have insurance

(26:49) you might not know this but in the adult world for people who have jobs they still have things called co-pays whoa

(26:56) really wow yeah really insane is that crazy hey guys isn't that crazy I'm saying I didn't know what they were oh

(27:02) wait so no doctor anywhere charges people with insurance money you're a [ __ ] genius bro you said that not me

(27:07) those are words from your mouth then why would you why would you your exact words were so you have no insurance okay so

(27:13) you can't afford your exact words were so you have no insurance yes or no yes

(27:18) or no your exact words were so you have no answer words

(27:25) you like to cut people off you're like Alex let's rewind the video I'm gonna take the time and let's see if he's

(27:31) ready I asked you if you had insurance no you made a statement that I didn't you kind

(27:37) of just went over I'm gonna assume you don't have insurance so it seems like you have a high paying job I have

(27:42) insurance what are you talking about that's what I'm trying to sneak around so I guess this city you're talking about apparently I'm an idiot because I

(27:48) go to you are an idiot yes yeah oh I'm so stupid okay let's go back so you have a good paying job so when you feel fine

(27:55) do you go to per year when you feel fine do you go to the doctor so you're gonna ignore my question how much yeah I'm not

(28:00) going to answer how much money he is dodging Dennis press him on it

(28:06) because he doesn't listen when the stupid mod process him so maybe if Dennis you know what's funny Greg like

(28:11) you have like you get [ __ ] he's an incel like Andrew hasn't been with a new girl in years

(28:19) that's in seldom apparently because you're you're blue pilled

(28:24) you're you're only you're only right right now why would you buy a woman

(28:31) could be really low right now and he wouldn't know it Andrew he's technically not an incel and it's all someone who

(28:37) doesn't have sex I'm sure by definition okay okay Andrew so you're what like 38.

(28:43) he's not be he's not trying to figure out okay so he's was he in his foreign

(28:53) I mean it seems like he just chose a different life path like he just wants to have like a family and [ __ ] okay let's let's just step away from his

(29:00) family life let's not bring Christianity into it let's just talk about modern medicine okay you can talk about my family and wife that's fine let's talk

(29:06) about your family life too okay let's talk about it yeah did you have a mommy and a daddy yeah I did

(29:11) actually that they stayed together for you yeah I was happy then what's your [ __ ] problem with the relationship of

(29:18) me staying together with my wife or my children because I don't believe in the Bible I think the Bible

(29:24) here's your exact word stupid you said I'm happy my mommy and daddy stayed

(29:30) together for me yes your exact words were yes I'm happy they stayed together for me magically

(29:36) changed to Andrew from The Crucible I'm not Greg lyric now I'm Andrew from The Crucible

(29:43) of course you don't your brain magically shuts off when people present logic and facts but when they talk about you

(29:50) haven't presented anything like if I said yo John 3 16 said this your eyes would light up

(30:05) testosterone levels start dropping typically for men yeah but there are symptoms for that doctor in years

(30:10) there's some consumer right now and you wouldn't even know what symptoms of things are though they're symptoms yes

(30:16) there are symptoms so just because you feel fine doesn't mean you're fine yeah but I mean that could be the case that

(30:21) could be the case for anybody at any time do you go to the doctor every single day uh no but I get annual checkups but don't you think don't you

(30:28) think you generally would go to the doctor we're not feeling well isn't that usually when people go to the doctor you have annual checkups like every few

(30:34) months generally speaking not really you have them everything Alex were to pull the audience right now and say how many

(30:40) of you guys actually go to the doctor for uh General checkups well yeah they have STDs because no no no no not STDs

(30:47) why are you talking about STDs I'm talking about just like regular stuff how many times have you gone to this

(30:52) hang on I just I'm just curious how many times have you gone to the doctor for STDs uh plenty of times I get tested I'm

(30:58) sure you've got plenty of times yeah do my test results

(31:04) go to the doctor so much you're concerned Bros debate but on this one Greg does

(31:12) have a point annual checkups are a good idea for men to do uh because you can catch things and prevent them before they even happen

(31:19) yeah um you know who never has to go to the doctor to get checked up on it for STDs people who are happily married or

(31:27) in cells because technically they're not answering not for STDs for things more like your your um you know your heart

(31:32) functional okay yeah but that was my question that I asked him was how many times have you gone for the STDs and you said plenty of times do you trust your

(31:38) wife yeah so you feel like you don't have to get a STD test because you're with your wife

(31:43) yeah what if you one day found out your wife wasn't loyal to you how would you react not well not good yeah would you

(31:50) get mad at her the guy if you found out who the guy was uh I would be angry with her okay gosh

(31:56) so you're fairly confident that your wife isn't cheating on you know

(32:02) a happy Christian man right he's not it's not fairly confident I'm 100 confident okay okay did you marry a

(32:10) virgin Andrew no all right oh oh that's interesting she

(32:16) didn't she didn't marry a virgin either but it still worked out yeah it's worked

(32:22) out fine what was like what were your guys's body counts

(32:28) yeah I don't I'm not getting into all that dude they weren't how are you dodging it huh

(32:33) why are you dodging the questions Dodge a lot of questions that's not your concern

(32:40) why would that be a concern for you I'm serious about this

(32:45) let's do some quick Maps Andrew do you know how many cigarettes you smoke per day just give me a rough estimate I

(32:51) don't know pack a whole pack how many do you smoke a week

(32:56) well let's see if it's seven days a week um

(33:01) three times that by year you're smoking a lot of cancer sticks do you think that

(33:07) has no impact at all your health I think it has a I think it has a disproportionate effect for different

(33:12) people depending on their physiology how much they exercise how sedentary they are okay in my opinion I think you

(33:19) should switch over to weed because weed is like all natural as opposed to cigarettes are man-made with hella with

(33:27) hundreds of sketchy chemicals so you should just stick to the plant God made

(33:32) which is marijuana um now uh Now Greg Greg I'm just curious

(33:38) what's your body count uh 145 as of this moment and do you have receipts I do

(33:44) have receipts actually I haven't only well do you want to check out my own let's see the receipt for all sexy hunks actually that's the answer no I do I

(33:51) have pornos the general pornos of a Jewish yeah a true degenerate

(33:57) did you say a Jewish man yeah I'm a Jewish man

(34:09) okay Andrew how about this can you showcase one receipt before your wife just one we're asking for yeah I'm not

(34:15) gonna do that you so you can't showcase one receipt for what of you being with a woman before your

(34:22) wife can I showcase everything no I can't so you can't you have no receipts other

(34:27) than your wife not well I mean no I don't keep correspondence between women

(34:33) that I was with 18 years ago okay so that's the last time you were with another woman was 18 years ago yeah I've

(34:39) been married for a long time bro okay well I don't know I just see you occasionally coming to Alex's streams I don't know your like whole biography I

(34:45) just told you I do you keep do you have receipts from 18 years ago I do well actually no 18 years ago no but I have

(34:51) receipts from right now well that's when I lost my virginity 18 I'm 27 cyber

(34:57) scenes from nine years ago so you don't have yeah time ago I mean I have receipts from me

(35:02) getting my dick sucked at 16 if that makes you feel any better but gross I'm sure well it is you're speaking to live

(35:08) the generates on playing let's talk about like yeah so what is that what does that do for you being a being a

(35:13) Jewish degenerate what does that do for you it's [ __ ] amazing and then you should meet my best friend Pastor Aiden I have good conversations with him about

(35:20) being a Jewish degenerate and how does that go how does everybody get Jewish crazy because the uh Pastor

(35:26) Aiden's a wild card I don't think you've been exposed to him yet Alex has

(35:35) so essentially you're upset with me because I think that degenerate meaning Campground morality has no morals

(35:42) applies to people who have no morals that's what you're upset about um no not quite I'm actually uh well I'm

(35:48) technically not upset I was more confused why you randomly brought me up after yeah so do you under because I

(35:54) want to know why you're always spurging at me in your chat do you understand why that distinction is made between people who can ground their morals and those

(36:00) who can't do you know why that's done no I know morals I just think that tell me tell me what your moral okay

(36:06) morals in general yeah no just ground your name Judaism ground your morals my morals are

(36:13) not just Judaism I think okay so this is where we differ right so you believe that a man can only okay wait Dennis

(36:20) okay that's sorry wait guys one second there's there's one guy backstage she said he only he only

(36:27) has five minutes to go back to work and he just wants to make three yeah yeah we'll we'll pause that I'll be here well yeah yeah let's just bring this guy on

(36:34) real quick what's up hey hey guys uh hey Alex thanks for having me on I just have three points

(36:41) for Andrew by uh abstaining from sex is BS sex

(36:46) outside of marriage okay so number one so that that's that implies that that

(36:53) denying yourself pleasure makes you a good person that's about

(36:58) makes about as much sense as like like the there's a sec that a Catholic sex

(37:04) that that flogs them walks through the streets clogging themselves once a year that's because that supposedly makes

(37:11) them a good person most people uh don't agree with that that's number one yeah hang on hang on hang on can we take can

(37:17) we can we kind of take these one point at a time no I have to make them uh real quick and then I'll listen to your your

(37:23) response off the air so the second oh I gotta write them down again

(37:28) that's a logical argument now I have an emotional argument so knowing that women

(37:33) are more emotional and more more impulsive than men are and they like sex as much as men do and

(37:40) their it's much easier for them to get sex how

(37:46) would you feel knowing that all the women are having uh wild casual sex and

(37:52) um but but you abstain from sex thinking and making you a good person but all the women are having wild casual sex and

(37:59) you're the only one left out so that's an emotional argument like most guys wouldn't feel too good about that and

(38:06) then the uh pragmatic arguments and the hypocrisy argument is if you watch porn

(38:12) if you have seen from sex watch porn and jack off that's just just as much as sex

(38:19) act as everything else you know so so United standings from cells if you've ever jacked off in your entire life

(38:26) and and not only that and here's another hypocrisy argument uh if say say you

(38:33) meet the women of your dreams she checks all the boxes she's amazing smart funny you know good person

(38:41) and she likes you as much as you like her but she wanted to have sex on the first date would you say no yeah you

(38:49) know so most guys are lying to themselves if they even say no and if they did say no they'd probably regret

(38:55) it later she said she'd be like I'm not interested anymore you I think you're playing games you don't want to have sex

(39:01) so those are my three points and uh I I dare you to review all three all

(39:08) right yeah I wish we could have gone through all three of them one at a time what was the

(39:14) what was the first point I'll listen to yours yeah just give me the Consolidated version real quick so I can write it

(39:21) down uh

(39:26) uh okay Consolidated version is okay uh I got the jerking off I got the

(39:33) jerking off it's the same as sex okay got that one what else uh denying yourself pleasure makes you a good

(39:39) person that's illogical and then if you found out that all the women were having

(39:45) wild casual sex and you are not uh you wouldn't feel too good about that

(39:51) that's an emotional argument okay and then if you found out if you

(39:57) found out women were having sex and you weren't involved you would feel bad

(40:02) uh yeah most guys wouldn't be too happy they find out the the girl in their dreams had had lots of wild casual sex

(40:09) and uh you missed out uh but but you didn't right that's an emotional argument

(40:15) that's why you guys worried about the body Cuts yeah yeah I got it all right all right thanks

(40:22) I need taker you want to answer these yeah so the first thing is he says denying yourself

(40:28) pleasure makes you a good person is a logical uh that that's actually not an

(40:33) illogical statement because there's no contradiction but uh from the perspective of the argument sense nobody

(40:40) says that denying yourself pleasure makes you a good person that's not the Christian worldview the Christian worldview is that you are maintaining

(40:48) your abstinence for the purposes of Purity and that Purity is the value that we're after here that's a much better

(40:55) value than promiscuity so this this would fall under what's virtuous and

(41:00) what isn't virtuous and then we could argue from the premise of what's virtuous and then if you found out women

(41:05) were having sex but you weren't that that would make you feel bad okay well that's a like an argument if you found out people who are around you were

(41:11) Millionaires and you weren't it would make you feel bad does that mean that they should have to give you their money all right but it has again nothing to do

(41:18) with virtue it's not really an argument it's a non-argument whether or not they

(41:23) they would feel bad about it or not is completely irrelevant to the point

(41:28) so it's we're talking about what's virtuous and what isn't virtuous and this is the difference between having

(41:34) grounding for your ethics and not having any grounding for it so if you want to bring that other guy on now so that we

(41:40) can get back into this because I want to know what his moral system is yeah he said he needs uh five minutes he's doing

(41:46) something this is actually a very interesting Super Chat I want to ask you Alice ask Andrew if he believes in UFOs and how that fits in with his religion I

(41:53) don't well I mean I believe in unidentified aerial phenomenon for sure I've seen some of that myself but as far

(41:59) as like aliens and [ __ ] like that no what if uh you were shown irrefutable

(42:06) proof that there are aliens out there would that [ __ ] with your like religious perspective at all or would you

(42:12) reconcile that well it would be this like you're liking this to asking me like what if you were shown irrefutable

(42:18) proof within a hypothetical that God wasn't real would that [ __ ] with your religion well yeah yeah if somehow you could demonstrate

(42:24) with your irrefutable proof that there was no God uh with that mess with my head yeah of course it would so the

(42:31) thing is just like it it's but remember it's baked into the hypothetical the

(42:37) question that you're asking it's baked into the hypothetical it's like asking if you were dead would you be alive

(42:42) anymore it's like no right no I don't I don't see how they're mutually exclusive you could have aliens

(42:47) and a God right like why are they mutually exclusive you you could right but you're asking in the hypothetical

(42:53) with that [ __ ] with my religion okay it will cause you to question things basically yes okay gotcha okay

(42:59) uh all right so all right so we'll bring on one more person before Greg uh

(43:05) because I guess he needs time to do some [ __ ] uh so let's bring on the this dude

(43:10) okay hello hey what's up not much what's going on so I got a

(43:16) question for you guys what do you think I mean just I've seen your channel a little bit uh what do you

(43:22) think the most important attributes all right let's put it like this if you had a son I don't know if you have kids

(43:28) Andrew I don't think you do Alex or that you know of right um

(43:34) oh damn you got five all right congratulations what do you think the

(43:40) most important attribute I mean that no no I appreciate I appreciate it I appreciate that yeah what do you think

(43:46) the most important attribute and you out for Alex would be if you had kids

(43:51) to teach your son turning 18 so to speak what I'm getting at is the most

(43:58) important virtue you think that you would bestow upon a young man

(44:03) and so so I mean there'll be so many self-responsibility I think uh you know extreme ownership

(44:10) um I don't consider those to be virtues why

(44:16) no because they don't fall under the purview of Virtues so for virtue virtue for instance would be something like

(44:21) Temperance I think Temperance would be extremely important so if I was to if you were to say pick one virtue out of a

(44:28) list now Alex you can call whatever you want to Virtue I'm just saying I disagree with the concept that those are

(44:34) virtuous um self-ownership's not a virtue why would that be virtuous what's virtuous

(44:40) about self-ownership because you take responsibility for everything in your life and still blame you on other people

(44:45) yeah I mean I think that that could fall under what I would consider a virtue if

(44:51) you explain it that way so I think that that's fair but I would say you would say I'd say Temperance

(44:57) Temperance is the most important so being even keeled and emotionally stable I think that that's the most important

(45:03) thing to teach a man on his way out the door if they fail at everything else on planet Earth I think that Temperance is

(45:11) the one okay I would say um discipline and delayed gratification

(45:18) that's Temperance though that would fall under the purview of temperance

(45:24) okay discipline yeah discipline so that would be self-discipline so you wouldn't be able to have Temperance without

(45:30) self-discipline yeah you're right so would it be would it be fair to say

(45:36) that most men to the young men whatever any men are missing that

(45:42) yeah it's one of the it's one of the key problems it's one of one of the reasons I advocate for religion is because

(45:47) religion will go over these so somebody in the chat actually helpfully posted the virtues humility charity Chastity

(45:53) gratitude Temperance patience and diligence um I think that I think that Temperance

(45:58) is a is a requirement to have any of the other ones so I would say um now you

(46:04) know there's obviously you could argue it kind of either way uh but I think that Temperance requires patience and I

(46:10) think Temperance requires a bit of gratitude and uh maybe not charity but maybe charitability towards people

(46:17) um maybe not charity in the conventional sense of like you're handing out money or Goods but at least being charitable

(46:23) towards the people you're talking to like you you came on the call you're not hostile you just want to talk

(46:29) um so I'm going to be as charitable as I can be right but I think that Temperance is a big one if I had to put if I had to

(46:35) like label anything as the most important if I was at gunpoint they said Andrew you have to do it right now

(46:40) that's the one I would pick yeah I'll look up there's two definitions but the second one the

(46:45) quality of moderation or self-restrained yeah I do think that's important the first definition is abstinence from alcoholic drug but I'm assuming that's

(46:52) not what you need well there's also religious definitions remember that that the dictionary definition just like

(46:58) a legal definition or a medical definition is going to be different than a religious definition so what's your definition of temperance

(47:06) uh well I think I think that Temperance if I was going to condense it the best way I possibly could uh in kind of a

(47:12) layman's term would be even keeled and emotional coolness so it doesn't mean that you're you have a lack of emotion

(47:18) or or things like this but you know how to control them moderate them and and

(47:24) act upon them without being uh of you know too terrified to act so I think that that would be the best way that I

(47:31) would describe as like even keeled yeah emotional mastery right yeah emotional Mastery is a good

(47:37) way to look at it yeah go ahead yeah sorry all right are you

(47:44) fully on board with that Alex I'm just asking it's not a loaded question yeah I mean I don't know if it's like my number

(47:50) one but it'll bother me top three sure yeah okay so no I follow up to that

(47:55) because I do agree with you um I might have phrased it differently just because I'm coming from a different place but I think I align with what

(48:01) you're saying so how do you think the best way

(48:07) to impact Society with that is and I'm not

(48:12) asking you to do it I'm just talking kind of high level here kind of like from a perspective yes you're so you're talking from uh from a prescriptive

(48:18) level what's the best way to do it best way to do it is to demand that men take responsibility right so that they have

(48:25) more responsibility and um and that you know I think I think that that's a huge problem you know what

(48:31) I mean yeah we have now what we have now is a shift of responsibility women women don't even even take their share of

(48:38) responsibility right but men often run from it they often run from it so it's

(48:43) problematically you can be you can be very responsible and not be religious right you can be yes

(48:52) so isn't it kind of ironic now what's going on that you were hinting at that you were getting at that right Society

(48:59) is running at a level men and women are equal we're the same but as you just pointed out men have a higher level of

(49:06) responsibility innately biologically in some senses I'm not saying every single aspect yeah

(49:14) so egalitarianism is is is fake it's it's it's literally it's a faux

(49:19) proposition right there's no such thing as egalitarianism inequality that's just made up [ __ ] right right but what

(49:25) I'm getting at is that in that happening that what we have is men not actually

(49:30) taking the responsibility and kind of into some degree right on some levels yeah and saying to women well here you

(49:36) go this is what you wanted and they're kind of like [ __ ] I don't want this I just want the good stuff that comes

(49:41) with it right that's feminism right right yeah yeah that's feminism so what

(49:46) I mean by uh when men aren't taking responsibility what I mean by this is I think that

(49:52) uh men have been checking out of society based on women's Behavior more and more and more and that's what I see inside of

(49:58) like these communities when I talk to you guys is that there's a great checkout which is happening they're like look these [ __ ] Can't Behave they're

(50:05) acting like [ __ ] skanks they're doing all sorts of [ __ ] they're lying they're back biters they're cheating they're doing all the [ __ ] they're not supposed

(50:11) to be doing and so they actually check out they just like check out of the system altogether that's part of that

(50:16) men going your own way kind of the mgtow thing is when they're kind of remove themselves away from the system maybe

(50:22) they just buy a prostitute every once in a while they play video games with their friends and they try to enjoy their life I think though that that's kind of

(50:28) abandoning all of your virtues which is I think that you should get married I think you should have children I think

(50:35) you ought to do those things not just because they're commanded by God but because I think it gives you a more whole life even if you don't believe in

(50:40) God I still think it's optimal for men to do this well there's different levels of checking out so the most extreme level

(50:47) of checking out would be when you go like full Motel where you're just like you don't do anything romantic or sexual

(50:52) woman that's pretty rare in this community it's not common uh a more common is a partial checkout where guys

(50:59) are like yo I'm not gonna date these girls I'll just have sex with them that's like a part that's what you see happening in the record I think that's

(51:05) true yeah I think I think that that's correct but the thing is is that I see people going to more and more extreme

(51:10) modes as the relationship Dynamics in the west break down and the birth rates are a reflection of the relationship

(51:17) Dynamics breaking down women want to have families less and less and pursue careers more and more and men don't want

(51:23) to date men they want to date women they want to have sex with women they want to marry women right they don't want somebody there's so many women out there

(51:30) though still that want to have a family I feel like yeah okay maybe a little bit more but the Pickens are the Pickens are

(51:36) slim and the big problem is that they want to start families later and later in life right so they want to wait until

(51:41) they're until they're all done with their careers and the [ __ ] Carousel then they want to start their family and that's uh that's a big problem they want

(51:48) to eat their cake and have it too yep that's right they want to have their kids yeah the men that they want generally don't want them at that point

(51:55) that's that's also correct they don't they generally don't want them if there's something that's younger and with less baggage they'll and and

(52:02) they're both available they'll go for the thing that's younger with less baggage pretty much every time right and

(52:07) I don't blame them like I don't blame them for doing that right none of this is contrary to Christianity by the way

(52:14) just to be clear that's a huge percentage of guys who'll just like take whatever they can get one well they'll

(52:20) have sex with whatever they can get no no they're going to settle down with it well they'll actually date whatever they can get

(52:27) there's some men there's some men who will do that yes

(52:32) to do that that used to do that there's probably four different

(52:38) categories like people that do nothing people that Retreat like oh like I got

(52:44) divorced I'm staying away from women people that take like average action and then like people that are like Alex and

(52:51) like go full time you know and just get to hundreds of Lays

(52:58) yeah also it's not hard to find a girl who's well okay let me rephrase that it's not

(53:04) impossible to find a girl who's great who's awesome who's not high body count who's loving caring and blah blah all

(53:11) that exists uh I think there's a disconnect between guys and girls uh

(53:16) because back in the day you used to meet girls through uh through I don't know work or through uh your friends and

(53:23) that's becoming less and less common so there's a disconnect that's going on but uh those girls do exist if you know how

(53:28) to look and where to look yeah whether you are any more like tangible

(53:35) stuff like what do you mean by like take responsibility like get a job like you

(53:40) know what like what do you mean who are you asking Andrew

(53:47) as far as uh responsibility goes so I think yeah men are men are the inheritors and Crafters of all of

(53:53) society they're the Crafters of rules and they're the Protectors of Rights even of other men and I think that many

(53:59) of them shirk the responsibility inside of that domain because they have no higher value or higher calling to go

(54:05) towards at all foreign now wouldn't you agree that it's men I

(54:13) mean and I don't mean specific men although there is specific men that put us in this position to begin with feminism uh women voting all the things

(54:21) all the right different facets that have led to modern day it was mostly technology honestly right but where did

(54:29) that come from right and I'm not trying to say oh men are bad obviously I'm a man I'm saying that at the end of the

(54:34) day I look at that as responsibility that we put ourselves here and sure technology I agree with you but I don't

(54:41) want to just scapegoat it to like oh well it landed in our laps no we created that [ __ ] well there's no there's no

(54:47) point in like beating yourself about the whys yeah no

(54:53) I agree with you it doesn't matter how we got where we got uh I mean no it

(54:58) matters it matters why or how we got where we're at if you don't know history you're doomed to repeat it right and so

(55:07) yeah sure if you're in a position of power if you're just like your average dude who's not no no all men are in a

(55:14) position of power whether they know it or not they're in a position to take power they're in a position to seize control of their families of their lives

(55:21) things like this or are in positions to do this women uniquely are not in positions to do this except the

(55:27) allowance of men they uniquely cannot do this without men men are the groundation

(55:32) and grounding and foundation for women's rights their equality their everything they get everything from us so we've

(55:39) always had a unique autonomy and authority to do this women though they're the gatekeeper of who gets to

(55:45) reproduce so men tend to compete with each other over who gets to reproduce What which woman so they try to go for

(55:50) the hottest woman that they can the most beautiful woman that they can the you know or the highest status woman that they can get which usually has those

(55:57) attributes right and so this is the the old age old Battle of the Sexes but the

(56:02) thing is is one of the things that religion promotes right is these type of behavioral patterns that the degens

(56:08) would consider to be optimal in women okay um that's what religion is promoting

(56:14) even the things that you guys would see as optimal trades religion is going to promote those optimal traits in women

(56:20) okay Andrew let's say you're the average guy has an average job living in a state that's uh

(56:26) um always goes one way either Republican or Democratic State not a swing state what power do you have to change that's

(56:32) the wrong way to look at power power dynamics don't just work on a level of I vote so therefore I have power power

(56:39) dynamics work and localizations more than they do anything you have men who lead other packs of men you have men who

(56:45) are leaders at work you have men who Rise Above The Fray things like this they have extraordinary Community power

(56:51) regardless of who goes and votes on National issues or even who votes on localized issues those are the men who

(56:57) craft the legislation you're voting on to begin with I mean there's there's a small percentage of men who will have the

(57:03) majority of the power uh and there's some men who have a little bit well it's not

(57:08) when you say small it's not that small right if you go to any work environment

(57:14) on planet Earth you're going to see certain men who rise above the other ones right there's tons and tons of

(57:19) factories and small job centers things like this that people work at at you know all the time so you're talking

(57:26) about tens and hundreds of thousands of men who are in these unique leadership roles so any it's kind of easy to

(57:33) marginalize it and say I'm like look there's just there's very few of these men there's not there's

(57:39) actually quite a few of them far more than you think yeah they might have influence on their like local team

(57:45) whatever that they're involved in or maybe even on the company as a whole but they're not going to be the ones who are making decisions about what product

(57:52) we're going to manufacture what kind of advertising we're going to do that's a very small percentage they do especially

(57:57) if they collectivize when they collectivize they do have the power to determine those things on a local level

(58:02) which gives them significant power even nationally and these collectives often coordinate with other collectives who

(58:09) share their similar ideology and that's how you end up with Trends that's how you end up with

(58:14) um with all sorts of different legislation which which ends up uh you know moving forward in different parties

(58:19) getting formed and localized parties getting formed and unions and all this is through the organization of

(58:25) extraordinary men and then less extraordinary but still extraordinary men who follow them Andrews are you Pro

(58:31) Union then uh depends

(58:37) sometimes I'm pro-union it depends on what it's a what what type of Union you're talking about

(58:43) um let's just take like Starbucks Union or uh no Amazon now corporate unionization is more exploitative to the

(58:50) employee than it is helpful to the employee these men have a power through

(58:57) collectivization in Union but if you're anti-union how does that the union doesn't have to be an organization which

(59:04) is specific to work I'm saying they can unionize over any number of different issues when all I mean by unionized is

(59:10) collectivize that's it I don't mean J you know they can join a [ __ ] work Union though they could and that could

(59:17) be that could be a way in which they could uh affect you know local policy and it's happened that way before but

(59:23) they can unionize in any number of different ways sometimes they have clubs right you have different clubs that form around different interests you

(59:30) um maybe have sports leagues which form around different interests and then they begin to move towards political action there's all sorts of different ways that

(59:36) men collectivize yeah I think we just radically disagree on this I think power is in the hands of a few and some people have a small

(59:43) amount of power or sliver of power like I have you're not have a little bit of power you have the power to affect your audience I have the power to affect my

(59:50) audience well in the grand scheme of things our power levels like point zero zero zero zero zero what do you think

(59:55) power is ability to change uh the course of history change people's opinions well

(1:00:02) that's a really really so one of those is a really high bar the ability to

(1:00:07) change history and one of them's a really low bar which is the ability to change Minds so if it's just the ability

(1:00:14) to change mine surely you have a significant amount of power uh in terms of my audience yes but in

(1:00:21) terms of the grand scheme of things like like for example let's say that uh I think that I don't know that Biden is

(1:00:28) the worst thing ever and I want my biggest goal in life is to keep finding from being elected I have close to zero

(1:00:34) power in that regards right like like my audience doesn't really look to me for voting and even if they did it's very limited compared to the whole you know

(1:00:41) the amount of people who vote right so yeah like even when it comes to that I have some influence but the influence

(1:00:47) I'm cognizant of the fact that influence is very limited now someone like Joe Rogan has allowed more influence he has

(1:00:52) a lot more power well I don't understand did lightning strike these people so they had this power or did they work towards a worthy goal and move towards

(1:01:00) that over yeah but that's what I'm talking about that's what I mean by responsibility

(1:01:05) what I mean by this is what I said it's uh literally the moving towards a worthy

(1:01:12) goal through some sort of collectivization lightning didn't strike them they worked towards this goal

(1:01:17) that's part of responsibility yeah all that is great I'm just saying there's for every Joe Rogan there's 20 000

(1:01:24) people that you've never heard of yeah but that doesn't mean that they have no power they might exercise quiet

(1:01:30) power quiet Authority I mean there's people they probably have close to zero power

(1:01:35) no I don't think so I think that if you look at sometimes producers and things like this oftentimes they're not well

(1:01:42) known in the public eye but they move things behind the scenes in a major way yeah

(1:01:48) like how much influence do you have to have like Hollywood producers Alex I'm

(1:01:54) talking about people who produce products like what manufacturers like yes

(1:02:00) producers people who make stuff people want they so they can affect massive

(1:02:05) massively they can affect local policies with money right or with jobs or with

(1:02:10) zoning regulations or with any number of different things there's all sorts of people who are producers of things which

(1:02:15) have enormous amount of power who are not known in the public eye what sure you're right about that so that means

(1:02:21) the CEO the CFO maybe the you know the marketing director they do have a lot of influence and the small business owner a

(1:02:28) lot a lot of things yeah and the small businesses all the people who are like the employees of those they don't really

(1:02:33) have much influence at all unless they unionize and then in which case they might have some level of power and they

(1:02:39) can bargain with the ball they have a different set value of power which is that if they have families and things

(1:02:44) like this they're creating the mindset for the entire Next Generation so that's

(1:02:49) the thing is that that's that's a huge amount of power to give a man that if you have multiple children you can

(1:02:55) affect their mindset for how they live their lives in the Next Generation you can affect significant change especially

(1:03:01) if you can collectively change enough men's Minds to teach your children the same value structure

(1:03:07) um yeah you have power over your kids you don't have power for like other people's kids unless you're like Entertainer but anyway we're kind of

(1:03:13) going off track all right what did you want to talk about Niles or base

(1:03:19) um all I wanted to talk about was to go back towards a moral grounding discussion the Christianity with Andrew if he was after that yeah

(1:03:26) yeah I just wanted to start by asking like um Andrew are you a Divine you're really low you're really low I can't

(1:03:32) hear you very well sorry can you hear me better now uh see if Alex can turn your your mic up a bit yeah this is already

(1:03:37) pretty good but I'll turn it all the way up okay try now thank you am I better Andrew yeah yeah

(1:03:43) yep all right cool cool I wanted to ask if you were a Divine command Davis meaning that whatever God says is moral

(1:03:50) by virtue of him saying it uh well yeah I mean we do believe in

(1:03:56) Divine command but you would have to Define it more clearly I just mean like for example when

(1:04:02) documented Abraham to sacrifice Isaac or Ishmael depending on the translation

(1:04:07) uh-huh was that moral because God can handle it or do God console the

(1:04:13) different moral code outside of his own opinion too propose that degree

(1:04:18) yes it was a it's a moral action if for God all morality comes from God that's

(1:04:24) correct yes so I just wanted to get that straight across so also

(1:04:31) for you personally um do you have any qualms with the ability for people to receive forgiveness from God for their actions

(1:04:39) no like no matter the person they can receive forgiveness from God no matter

(1:04:45) what they do you got to speak up bro I'm sorry I didn't catch the last part of what you said I'm sorry it's no problem I was

(1:04:52) just saying no matter the person or what they do they're able to receive forgiveness from God for their actions no that's not correct

(1:04:59) please foreign

(1:05:15) I I literally can't hear you I'm sorry I'm not trying to I want to have this

(1:05:20) conversation he wants to know what would happen that God couldn't forgive you that's what he's asking I'm sorry you're

(1:05:27) any better now uh yes way better dude way better okay so can you can you

(1:05:32) repeat again yes um so any action a person takes right

(1:05:39) you have no issue with them being able to receive forgiveness from God for that action they actually are sincere in

(1:05:44) their repentance yeah that would be correct okay

(1:05:49) um and there's no limitations to that right yeah this would be between them and God correct

(1:05:55) all right perfect so I don't make I don't make claims as to who has salvation or who doesn't the Orthodox

(1:06:02) don't either yeah that's absolutely fine I think that's yeah 100 in line with what the Bible teaches and says

(1:06:08) um so I don't think you're in Aaron in any way in your Christianity um what I'm proposing to you is the

(1:06:14) ability for someone to do acts that are on virtuous and repent is something that people who don't believe can also do so

(1:06:20) if someone doesn't believe in the Christian God or they believe in Allah or they're Janus they can also repent

(1:06:26) for their actions and seek Penance in this life for things they do that are not virtuous

(1:06:31) and because of that I don't think that having a religious worldview um places you're grounding any firmer

(1:06:37) because if someone does something immoral they can just sincerely believe and repent and be forgiven for that

(1:06:43) action and go to heaven anyway what if they do the action again the next day

(1:06:49) because they were yeah they're being insincere so so this would be based around

(1:06:55) sincerity yes if someone truly believed that what they were doing was wrong and repented

(1:07:01) for it and vowed and have to do it again okay so how would you know if they were sincere or not

(1:07:07) in their own opinion would it be their own opinion or is there Works which are involved

(1:07:14) their framework but I don't know so here's the delineation between you and I you believe that if a person repents it

(1:07:21) and you you claim that they feel like they're being sincere about their repentance that therefore they will receive salvation however that's not the

(1:07:28) Viewpoint of the Orthodox the Orthodox Viewpoint is that salvation is a process it's a lifetime process that requires

(1:07:36) endless amounts of work works right so we're all Sinners we're all working

(1:07:41) towards not being Sinners any longer right chief of Sinners right here I don't think that uh I'm any better than

(1:07:47) you in that department I've seen plenty uh just like uh just like the degens so

(1:07:52) salvation is a requirement of of works over an elongated period of time you

(1:07:58) don't just do one act and then you're saved that's that's insane so when we're comparing it to these other ideologies

(1:08:03) if what if they claim for instance like Protestants do that if you just have

(1:08:08) Jesus in your heart right whatever that means that you're saved how would that be demonstrated how would

(1:08:15) that be demonstrated that's a really difficult thing to do um it's a really difficult thing to do

(1:08:22) and Protestant Christians about that very question yeah because it's a because salvation is a process known as

(1:08:28) theosis and that's why it's this by the way um I don't believe that in moral

(1:08:35) relativism if anyone thinks that direction I was just presenting it as a thought experiment because I noticed

(1:08:41) that a lot of questions that I'm not throwing you in this bucket Andrew no I understand have very big mall issues

(1:08:46) with people who don't believe talking about morality grounding and the biggest thing that I notice in these type of

(1:08:53) discussions is that even someone like Pol Pot um King Leopold II of Belgium or Hitler

(1:08:59) could repent sincerely under Protestant Christianity yeah that's correct um believe in their heart mind and soul

(1:09:05) that they are under God's covenant and that they'll be forgiven and they'll be able to ascend to heaven like anyone else right they have no sacraments right

(1:09:14) but you have to have sacraments that that's part of the illustration of works works are an important part of

(1:09:20) Christianity which is left out often in protestantism not by all sex but by by

(1:09:25) most it's faith alone it's called solafide and solofide is part of the

(1:09:31) five solos solofide means by faith alone by faith alone you'll be saved we don't believe that that's true we don't even

(1:09:36) believe in any of the of the five Solas we don't think that any of them are legitimate in and of themselves that you

(1:09:42) have a church hierarchical structure which is important as part of your salvation

(1:09:48) there's quite a few people backstage uh do you just want to talk about religion or is there anything else you want to

(1:09:53) discuss um that was the main meat of it yeah

(1:09:59) well I appreciate it I hope we can have a conversation down the road bro yeah because I really I really enjoyed that

(1:10:06) one yeah yeah for sure I'll put you guys together uh thanks Niles appreciate you buddy have a good day ma'am no problem

(1:10:13) all right so you're cool with um Grace now right yeah I don't care all right cool well

(1:10:19) can I ask something what's up Chris hey Alex yeah sure okay you go to Reeve then

(1:10:24) Grace all right all right um what I was gonna ask what are your

(1:10:30) thoughts on like um Hedonism and um the implications of

(1:10:39) Hedonism and like modern day life you know like I think there's thoughts on Hedonism are pretty clear he's not a fan

(1:10:46) hang on let him ask like

(1:10:52) and how Hedonism has really affected the modern

(1:11:00) world as we speak now do you mean um I just want to make

(1:11:06) sure I get kind of our terms clear if you don't mind so when you're when you're asking about Hedonism do you mean

(1:11:13) do you mean self-indulgence or do you mean Hedonism in the sense of utilitarianism which is that

(1:11:21) um basically the the best action is the one that creates the least amount of suffering and the most amount of

(1:11:27) pleasure oh like Indulgence in like uh

(1:11:34) base Cardinal Pleasures like yeah so if we're just talking about

(1:11:39) Indulgence and that would just be materialism and if we're talking yeah if we're talking about materialism and its

(1:11:45) effect on modernity then it's one of the primary causes for why the world is so [ __ ] up is because of a materialist

(1:11:51) Outlook right with a lack of any sort of spiritualism whatsoever and would you say that

(1:12:00) um what was it gonna ask would you say that

(1:12:12) like pretty much are you are you okay I'm honest quiet are you okay like are

(1:12:20) you Andrew this is the king of kings please be respectful I'm thinking deeply about my next question

(1:12:27) um what would you say like about sex before marriage and and like how

(1:12:36) how like he's not a fan he's not a fan oh okay

(1:12:41) yeah he's not he's not a big fan of that uh

(1:12:46) all right Grace what do you want to talk about

(1:12:57) control everything because I mean just he knows I've had this experience

(1:13:02) with my mother where she completely turned on my family and got a restraining order against my dad men do

(1:13:07) not have control of their women like he thinks they do that's not my argument

(1:13:14) yes it is you said men have control of everything the only control women have is the business hang on stage just calm

(1:13:20) down Bruce tell me what my argument is I just said it repeat it okay so you

(1:13:27) think that my argument is that men have control of their women you said men have control of their

(1:13:33) families their life their they have a lot of power and that women only have the power that men give them

(1:13:38) I agree that's correct so let's uh so let's start from the grounding where rights come from

(1:13:44) God God grants you rights what rights does

(1:13:50) God grant you right to life the right to respect the right if God grants you the right to

(1:13:55) life then why do children die he grants the right it's like it's a

(1:14:01) god-given right that you should not be killed by other people that doesn't mean that people won't die okay so it's not a

(1:14:09) right to life then he grants you the right to not be murdered I mean are we talking legal rights here

(1:14:15) no I'm asking you I'm asking you specifically where rights come from tell

(1:14:21) me where they come from I don't know like for example like God

(1:14:26) gives a fetus the right to life then why do fetishes die that they have

(1:14:31) a right to live it's okay so why do people die it's a right to life like it's it's an

(1:14:37) essential right you have a right to dignity you just keep on restating the questions okay all right I asked it a right is not

(1:14:45) it's not a it's not an obligation it's not that you won't die but it's that you have the right to life you have the

(1:14:50) right so you said God gives you rights right what rights does God give you

(1:14:56) God gives you the right to marry who you want for example God gives you the right to marry who you

(1:15:01) want so how come there's men out there who might have women who marry other men besides them who they wanted to marry

(1:15:08) okay well rights is a legalistic term Society has to respect rights is in gym

(1:15:15) rights is also a philosophical term so the question becomes where rights come what do you think a right is let's start

(1:15:20) with that what do you think a right is a right is a legal term that means you are entitled to something so you don't

(1:15:26) think that there's anything more innate than legality to rights well yeah because it means you're

(1:15:33) entitled to something I think that that's a fair I think that that's a fair position so if rights are a legality

(1:15:38) meaning that they're a social construction that human beings come up with they're not actually from God right

(1:15:46) I mean what would God give us I would say he gives us gifts like the gift of life more than a right to life that's

(1:15:51) given to us by Society okay fair enough so so then your position isn't that God gives you rights but that rights are

(1:15:57) social construction by people yeah like yeah political okay so I think that that's fair so if rights are social

(1:16:03) construction of people right then who enforces the rights

(1:16:10) men or women Bingo um I mean I would say both but if you want to talk about like in terms of power physical power then no

(1:16:17) yes no I'm asking just I'm just asking hang on stop listen very closely to my question who enforces rights who's the

(1:16:25) enforcement mechanism for the rights of women is it women or men

(1:16:35) oh both both enforce the rights both they both enforce the rights yes

(1:16:41) yes so how do women do so how do you enforce rights absent

(1:16:46) physical power okay well women women can call the police just like men and who comes and

(1:16:52) who who shows up when they when women call the police musical power is for men yeah so how do you enforce rights absent

(1:16:58) physical power well there are lawmakers there are people who do things absent Than

(1:17:04) Physical powerless how do they enforce how do they enforce all of those laws and regulations and things that they

(1:17:10) pass absent physical power you cannot well I mean yeah at the end

(1:17:16) of the day when it comes down to it it is physical so then for your rights therefore The Logical conclusions

(1:17:23) stop so therefore If All rights are enforced by men and the rights of women

(1:17:30) are enforced by only physical power which he just agreed with in our logical conclusion has to be that all women's

(1:17:36) rights come from who okay okay okay fine if you want to no answer the question answer the question

(1:17:43) Andrew freaked out Andrew answer the question answer the [ __ ]

(1:17:50) question okay that's what he's going to do with you if you don't answer your BDSM routine I get it okay all right

(1:17:56) calm down all right yes they come from Men

(1:18:03) then why do women you would say that women are doing things that aren't fair to men right for example women can accuse men

(1:18:10) of rape right and there's nothing there's no accountability if it's a false accusation right

(1:18:16) and men have created that and Men enforce yeah I I just Andrew totally lost it he just he needs that's my um

(1:18:23) that's my backup Cam and it fell off anyway go ahead

(1:18:31) so if men according to your logic if men enforce these if men give women all their rights then why do women have

(1:18:37) rights that hurt men why can women do things that hurt men for example because men also give other men stop I'll answer

(1:18:43) your question okay we command also give other men rights

(1:18:48) okay well why would men give other men rights that hurt them like why would men enforce rights that actually hurt men

(1:18:55) they've done it since you've done a time so for instance I'm going to answer the question Grace Grace Grace

(1:19:03) one question at a time just one question at a time to answer your first question men have always done this they've always

(1:19:09) been able to give rights to men and take rights away from men so take slavery for instance men can enslave other men men

(1:19:15) can also take themselves out of slavery for instance they can fight their way out of slavery they can fight for a

(1:19:20) nation they can form a new nation they can do all of these different things right they Grant rights to other men too

(1:19:26) sometimes the rights that they Grant aren't fair to other men there could be that there's specific pockets of men who

(1:19:34) think that certain men shouldn't have rights or that women should have more rights but that doesn't mean that

(1:19:39) they're not coming from men you just logically walk through how they are

(1:19:45) okay but so you said like on a couple panels ago you said that the reason that

(1:19:50) women can do things that hurt men is because men are simps and women have convinced them to give them rights that

(1:19:57) aren't Fair yeah that's true yeah okay so then don't

(1:20:02) women have power according to your logic if women can convince men to give them those rights then women have the

(1:20:08) ultimate power women do it stop you're right to an extent that women do exercise some autonomy when it comes to

(1:20:15) seduction convincing um you know conniving all that type of

(1:20:21) different stuff right now men can do this too it's not exclusionary to women but yeah women do tend to exercise power

(1:20:28) softly but that really doesn't change the fact that their rights are going to be enforced or whatever they want

(1:20:34) enforced in society is going to be enforced by men whether they can convince men to do it or not that's a

(1:20:39) matter that's a completely different matter because when men decide to stop doing it women have no recourse

(1:20:45) at all none but if women can convince men to do something then women are the

(1:20:51) ones who have the ultimate power but men can convince men to do no because men can convince men to do it too so it's

(1:20:57) never an equal playing field this is the problem that you have with your logic is it's never an equal playing field

(1:21:02) everything that a woman can do um as far as conniving backbiting yeah

(1:21:08) even seduction all these different things men can also do those things the only distinction difference is that

(1:21:13) women will always have to rely on men for the enforcement arm of whatever the outcomes they want to see in society

(1:21:19) always there's no choice about it so so here's the distinction so if men

(1:21:25) collectively all get together and they say you have no more rights women women have no more rights but if women all get

(1:21:31) together and say men you have no more rights we go [ __ ] you and there's nothing women can do about that that's

(1:21:36) the distinction

(1:21:47) that this is axiomatic just like you just agreed there's no rights inherent from God the reason that you agree to

(1:21:53) that is because if we say that you have a right and yet the right's not enforced how is it a right

(1:22:07) Grace you said that right legal right these are legal do I have a

(1:22:13) right over my own body you don't have any rights I don't think rights exist I think they're made up fiction

(1:22:24) yeah because the men are the ones who determine what rights are no no God is the one who determines what

(1:22:30) rights are you just got done saying rights are only legal they are respected by Society but if

(1:22:36) somebody rapes me just I still have the right to my own body I still have the

(1:22:41) right they are just what gives you that right God so then how come God doesn't stop

(1:22:47) you from getting raped because

(1:22:52) well then answer the question if it's a stupid question then answer it if it's not right so then so then we're back to

(1:22:59) legalese we're back to legalese

(1:23:05) stop stop Grace you can't make the conflation of legalese versus right from God you say

(1:23:12) God gives you the right to not get raped then how come you can be raped if you have such a right answer my question

(1:23:22) don't answer my question with a question answer my question how does God allow things okay

(1:23:29) not my question that's not my question my question specifically I'm going to tell to you again if you have a right

(1:23:35) from God to not be raped then how come you can be raped

(1:23:41) okay if I have a right from don't answer my question and with the question just answer my question people

(1:23:48) stop answering my question with a question just answer my question

(1:23:54) she can't answer it God is not a legal Arbiter you can't you can't hear it well I didn't say he was you say you're

(1:24:01) making the conflationary term again between legalese and an inherent right so I'm saying if you have the inherent

(1:24:07) right to not get raped because God gives you such a right then how come you can still be raped makes no sense

(1:24:12) there's an easy explanation God has a rape case no no I want Grace to answer me answer the question Grace

(1:24:19) you can just say that you don't know Society has rights you could say how come Society gives you the right over

(1:24:27) your own body and yet you can still be raped does that mean the right doesn't exist yes and that's my argument thank

(1:24:33) you okay so society says that you have a right to your own body and people

(1:24:38) disrespect that and break the law and violate your right and yet because the lie because action enforcement there is

(1:24:45) no law right yeah that's right what makes it an actual right that can't be taken away absent

(1:24:50) enforcement hold up hold up hold up

(1:25:00) where do they come from the rights in society they come from

(1:25:05) society from law so men make them up right maybe yeah okay so if men make them up

(1:25:12) and if men be stop enforcing them then that means that you no longer have that right doesn't it

(1:25:18) no but it's not not enforced just because if somebody violates your right to something like if somebody rapes you that doesn't

(1:25:25) mean that that your right doesn't exist it just means that somebody's violating your rights so what makes the right in

(1:25:31) existence if people say you don't have that right what makes it exist what makes it real what makes it not fiction

(1:25:39) is it like a rock is it like a tree can I touch it can I smell it Can I taste it can I can I see it where all these

(1:25:46) rights point to the right Grace Point to the right where can I see them they're on the right treatment physical doesn't

(1:25:53) mean right so if they're immaterial so that's right so if they're not physical and they're immaterial in their social

(1:25:58) constructions and we made them up that means that absent us enforcing them they don't [ __ ] exist do they

(1:26:08) because people will say like if there are rules and somebody breaks a rule that doesn't mean that the rule doesn't

(1:26:13) exist as a rule that means how does the rule exist violating the rule Okay so

(1:26:19) how did the rule get made to begin with well people come up with rules right so

(1:26:25) if people decide if people decide to stop enforcing those rules do those rules exist anymore

(1:26:33) uh I don't know if somebody what do you mean you don't know

(1:26:38) well there are laws that aren't

(1:26:46) they're not enforced so like actively they don't exist but they so they don't exist

(1:26:52) s so so these are immaterials so these are immaterial things that are socially constructed that we come up with and

(1:26:59) absent enforcement they don't actually exist you claim earlier God is the one who gives you the rights but then when I

(1:27:05) ask you how come those rights can be violated your answer is well because they're actually legal so then when we go over to legal and ask the same exact

(1:27:11) question your answer is I don't know I don't know how it could be that you have something that's socially constructed

(1:27:17) and made up that if somebody violates it that it can't be just tossed right out the window because of there's no enforcement there is no such thing as a

(1:27:24) right Grace they don't exist if you can demonstrate that a right exists I want to hear it okay then what is your

(1:27:30) argument that men with their ants don't answer the question with a question how does your

(1:27:35) argument make sense that men have all this power over women because they're the one who enforce women's rights because they're Arbiters of what is

(1:27:41) right no but but men are the Arbiters of what is right God is the Arbiter of what is

(1:27:47) right men men decides what's what's right through reason and conscience okay let's back up

(1:27:54) say that you have a bunch of evil men who decide that they're not going to follow What God Says which has happened

(1:28:00) historically many many times you would agree right sure is God going to stop them from raping

(1:28:06) and pillaging no no so then those rights obviously

(1:28:11) aren't coming from God to say that they can't be violated because they can be violated so the question becomes this

(1:28:18) idea of a right where does a right come from other than we make them up and then

(1:28:24) enforce them through literally just Brute Force for instance if somebody comes to your home and they want to hurt

(1:28:30) you you say you're violating my rights men have to then come and enforce your rights on your behalf right

(1:28:38) okay but but okay so maybe I miss maybe I mischaracterize it God does not give us rights God doesn't owe us anything

(1:28:45) okay but God gives us reason and conscience which then help us to determine what people's rights are

(1:28:51) legally that are enforced by men I agree with you men right

(1:28:56) and now and there we go Grace so hang on Grace and so then Grace all you have to do is concede all you have to do is

(1:29:03) concede to the argument then that all rights come from Men well okay if you want to say everything

(1:29:09) that comes through men through God then that's the argument's done Grace thank you so much I appreciate the concession

(1:29:15) you said rights don't exist that's right they don't exist except a construction of what men make up no but that's not a

(1:29:21) construction of what men make up that's a conception of what meant what men interpret through reason and conscience which is given to them by God like taxes

(1:29:28) yeah so yeah so do you think that all societies all societies even absent God can come

(1:29:37) up with laws and come up with individual rights society's absent God I mean all of us

(1:29:43) have a reason in conscience we all have that we all have an ingrained sense that's not my question though my

(1:29:48) question is what do you mean outside yeah so if people reject god let's say they they're part of the satanic church

(1:29:54) for instance can they come up with a codified system of rights that you could then follow

(1:30:01) could they potentially yeah so then the conduit so then this conduit

(1:30:08) to God that you're talking about this is not always a direct one-to-one for what

(1:30:13) men can come up with with positive or negative rights can't right is that correct is that correct

(1:30:18) so then if that's correct whether those rights are fair who determines whether a

(1:30:24) right is just or unjust who determines it well so Joseph found what the founders did was they said it was

(1:30:29) axiomatic they judged it on an axiom we hold these truths to be self-evident that would be axiomatic they say rights

(1:30:36) are axiomatic they're self-evident you're making the same thing it comes from reason and conscience well there's

(1:30:43) they didn't specify but I think that I could probably grant that it comes from at least reason uh conscience I'm not so

(1:30:50) sure but maybe reason at least but they're saying they're these are axiomatic so it's known to everybody

(1:30:56) that these things are self-evident however they're not axiomatic because different cultures don't follow those laws or those rights so how can they be

(1:31:03) axioms they're not axioms so you say that rights come from God okay fair

(1:31:10) enough which Right comes from God I'm not saying rights come from God God doesn't owe us anything what I'm saying

(1:31:17) is we the rights come from right well rights come from men but what they come from is men based on their reason and

(1:31:24) conscience and following God but they still come from men like Justified there can be unjust

(1:31:30) rights to for example a woman has the right to divorce a man

(1:31:37) for no reason and take half his money right there's no fault divorce that's a legal right that's correct I agree is is

(1:31:44) made by is enforced by men if you want to talk about physically but that does not come from God that is an unjust

(1:31:50) right yeah I agree inspired by God it still comes from men that right exists

(1:31:55) it exists where does it exist what do you mean what you just agree

(1:32:01) that it's a right what do you mean now you're saying it doesn't exist didn't say it's a right I don't believe in rights told you that 50 times I said I

(1:32:06) said it's just right and right yeah I would say it's an unjust right that a man created that this is

(1:32:13) your Viewpoint so you say unjust men can create rights to say okay if unjust men can create rights still men creating

(1:32:20) rights that's right real quick I think this is an interesting Super Chat uh men violate

(1:32:25) the Ten Commandments and God doesn't enforce them are the commitments false then okay

(1:32:30) but that doesn't mean that doesn't mean that you have a right um or that God is going to enforce him

(1:32:36) right on your behalf to not be murdered because this would be the end this would actually be the antithesis to Free Will

(1:32:43) you would have to necessarily take away people's Free Will in order for God to give them given rights you understand

(1:32:50) that right Grace yeah yeah God doesn't know what a right is saying you are owed this by something

(1:32:56) right okay and I'm not God doesn't owe us anything so I think you get it now I think you understand now definition but

(1:33:04) between rights and whatever gifts from God or whatever it's not rights from God but what if you're saying rights don't

(1:33:10) exist at all no there's clearly something to tell us that rights are owed to people where are right where are

(1:33:17) these rights what are you saying because it's not a physical thing that it doesn't exist so yeah couldn't I ask you

(1:33:23) where do where's truth point to truth smarter than that so hang on so back up

(1:33:28) you say points of Truth a subjectivist could tell you that there's no such thing as objective truth however I

(1:33:34) believe in objective truth because I think God's word and you believe this too that God's word is objective truth

(1:33:39) so I can point to truth I can look at the Bible and look at the church point to both and say you get truth there

(1:33:45) no but truth is a concept you words you could say so you don't believe in objective you

(1:33:51) don't believe in objective morality so where do you get it where where do you get it where do you get it except

(1:33:57) from physical reality truth is being pointing to Something in physical reality for instance Grace are you

(1:34:03) having a conversation right now is that true I don't know yes how do you

(1:34:09) know because it lines up with reality thank you Grace

(1:34:15) but but well how do I know okay so you're saying that metaphysical concepts are are all based in

(1:34:22) physicality so do I have a conscience I think I think you do yeah probably

(1:34:28) okay is that a physical reality conscience I think that there are

(1:34:34) physical parameters that that assist or desist with conscious or conscience conscience a physical reality

(1:34:41) I'm trying to figure out what you mean by this is conscience conscience are you

(1:34:47) talking about Consciousness or your conscience conscience your sin wrong is that a physical reality

(1:34:53) I think that there are physical Elements which relate to it so that you can inform whether or not conscience is

(1:34:59) correct well Consciousness conscience is a conceptualization of a physical manifestation of X thing which happened

(1:35:08) yeah real quick This Guy's super chess I want to uh read this Grace ask Andrew if rice don't exist how can they be

(1:35:14) enforced by men or come from men if he thinks it's non-existent this is so low tier I've answered this 40 times it's a

(1:35:21) social it's a social construction writes are a social constructs so they they don't exist in material reality there is

(1:35:28) no such thing as a right to material reality it doesn't exist it's like gender doesn't exist in material reality

(1:35:34) it's a made-up terminology which points to a concept and the concept is just

(1:35:40) x x thing cannot be done to you or else there's going to be enforcement which stops that thing that it's an it's an

(1:35:48) immaterial thing so I can admit of course that you can have a

(1:35:53) conceptualization as a social construction that you call a right I think that that's fair to do but that

(1:35:59) really doesn't have any bearing on whether or not it objectively exists because it doesn't

(1:36:05) okay but you just said oh you just said how do I know what truth is and you said you could point to the Bible and say

(1:36:10) that's the truth so if you say well I'm giving you examples if I say if you say how do you know what rights are can't I

(1:36:16) point to the Constitution and say there they are well you can point to the Constitution say there's a piece of paper there

(1:36:22) there's writing on that piece of paper and the writing expresses like the Second Amendment says a well-regulation

(1:36:29) or a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed

(1:36:34) verbatim okay what makes that true

(1:36:39) but can I ask the same question of you if you point to the Bible don't ask me this question again

(1:36:46) just answer the question answer the question what makes it true that a well-regulated militia is necessary to

(1:36:52) the being necessary to the security of a free state that the right of the people to keep and bear arms should not be infringed your Second Amendment right

(1:36:58) what makes it true when people can come in and infringe right now on your Second Amendment right what makes it true

(1:37:04) I actually don't think that's a true right I don't think right right because the rights are just in your head and

(1:37:11) they're socially constructed and you made them the [ __ ] up everybody makes them somebody say that about the Bible

(1:37:16) if I ask you they could but then we could get into the transition because you cannot have objective standards of

(1:37:23) truth without a grounding Foundation of God it's impossible that's why so we know we have knowledge through our

(1:37:29) epistemology because of our faith in God Catholics believe this exact same thing

(1:37:35) but what I'm saying is you say they're not real you're saying right I'm saying yes they're not real

(1:37:42) but they're also metaphysical they're socially constructed hang on there are metaphysical things

(1:37:49) which are real like Consciousness the mind that would be metaphysical it is real the laws of logic are immaterial

(1:37:56) but they're real however these things you're talking about are social constructions you might as well be

(1:38:01) talking about a unicorn or a leprechaun or something like this

(1:38:16) if you saw a kid getting killed you'd say say that kid objectively has the

(1:38:21) right to his life and you'd know that was true you wouldn't say oh well that's just a social construct that somebody

(1:38:27) made up and if somebody else doesn't believe that that social construct applies then it's not real that kid so

(1:38:33) what you're saying so what you're saying is that I a man would see that and say this is a violation of his rights and go

(1:38:39) and force his rights for him that I made up for him right Grace I'm saying man or woman it's not that

(1:38:46) rights are just a social construct they are real you believe that they're real because if you saw somebody's basic

(1:38:52) rights being violated you would say that's not just a social construct that's not being followed that's a right

(1:38:59) that that person has that should be upheld no I wouldn't be defending this person I'm going to make an executive

(1:39:05) decision to move past this discussion uh what's uh What uh Mitch Murphy say

(1:39:12) his piece hey what's up you guys thanks Alex for hosting the debate thanks everybody for

(1:39:17) coming in nice job Grace um so I'm here I just wanted to challenge Andrew a little bit can you

(1:39:23) guys hear me okay yeah we're gonna hear you so I just wanted to challenge Andrew a little bit um and if you guys don't

(1:39:30) mind I'm kind of moving backwards a little bit to um earlier in the show um I'm here in defense of the

(1:39:35) degenerates because as it turns out most degenerates aren't able to make a very good case for themselves and their world

(1:39:41) view um so Andrew I've got a question for you we can't wait right

(1:39:50) um so Andrew will you Define degenerate as without morals is that is that correct

(1:39:55) yeah that's correct um now most degenerates that I talk to

(1:40:00) if I speak to them they say well um I I make up my own morality I based

(1:40:06) off some sort of intuition natural law they often appeal to stuff like that that's maybe not super coherent and you

(1:40:13) know I would concede that however what I'm trying to call into question here is whether or not you are actually in a

(1:40:19) better position than them because um and I just want to make sure that I'm not misrepresenting you I'm not trying

(1:40:25) to straw man you or anything like that but if if you're speaking to a degenerate person and they say well I

(1:40:31) make up my own morality you would still say that that person classifies as degenerate correct

(1:40:38) yes that's correct so if this person makes up their own morality as they go maybe they they draw

(1:40:44) from culture from movies from people that they know maybe they're feeling stuff like that

(1:40:49) um if that classifies them as a degenerate what I'm wondering is that if the Christian is actually in a better

(1:40:55) position because the Christian for one has to look at the different religions and decide which religion is true and

(1:41:02) then let's say they go beyond that they they say okay I'm going to pick Christianity well then at that point they have to go between Catholicism

(1:41:09) Orthodoxy protestantism let's say they pick Orthodoxy from that point they have to pick between rocor OCA antiochian

(1:41:16) they have all these different jurisdictions and even from within that they have to choose when they listen to

(1:41:22) their priests say something or the bishop say something they have to weigh it against the rudder that the Orthodox

(1:41:27) Churches run on and they have to basically it all comes down to the individual person deciding what is moral

(1:41:34) and what is not and so I'm just wanted to pose that challenge to you Andrew to see how you'd respond

(1:41:40) um with the potential that you may not be in a better position than the degenerate do you think that you can know what the

(1:41:48) truth is um do you believe in objective truth

(1:41:54) sure yeah how do you know if it's objective truth

(1:42:00) um well if I was a degenerate I might say it's based off my Intuition or if I

(1:42:05) was in a different position I might say that I weigh it logically I look at the different worlds so if you have one

(1:42:11) person who has an intuition for something which is true and a second person has an intuition which is against

(1:42:16) that how would we arbitrate which is correct uh probably through the laws of logic

(1:42:22) right the laws of logic are going to be able to defeat intuition

(1:42:27) it's not illogical to kill it's not illogical to kill somebody tell me why it is

(1:42:33) what's the performative contradiction with killing somebody why would that be a violation of the laws of logic sir

(1:42:39) well I I guess you could say show me the performative contradiction

(1:42:45) that would be the only thing that could violate the laws of logic what is the performative contradiction of killing

(1:42:52) somebody um the man he's using a lot of big words get me all spun up here

(1:42:59) um I guess what I'm one what I'm saying is that if you answer my question I just

(1:43:04) listen you remember how you answered or you asked me four different questions and I said yes that's correct absolutely

(1:43:10) yes yes yeah just answer my [ __ ] questions okay so yeah I want a specific

(1:43:16) answer to this is it right or wrong to have sex with a corpse wrong it's objective how do you know how

(1:43:23) do you know it's objectively wrong as an atheist to have sex with a corpse well it depends on how hot the corpse is

(1:43:32) I would say because I picked a moral code that tells me it's wrong and it's

(1:43:37) well somebody else picks a moral code that says it's right how do you know they're wrong I'm suppose you'd have to argue right

(1:43:44) which is where logic would come into the play so give me the performative contradiction

(1:43:50) the contradiction is that um both people at the end of the day have decided to believe Something to

(1:43:58) Believe In an external moral code and so what's the contradiction

(1:44:03) the contradiction is that both people it came down to an individual deciding that it's wrong

(1:44:09) what contradiction the the contradiction is that regardless

(1:44:17) of which code you've picked and regardless of who's correct or who's not both people have picked one so there's

(1:44:23) no contradiction so what's the contradiction am I missing something here do you know

(1:44:30) what a contradict what do you know what contradiction means yeah of course of course okay so then the laws of logic

(1:44:37) require if you say you could argue with Logic for why something is true or false you're looking for a performative

(1:44:42) contradiction to know that something's illogical that's the only way you can say it's illogical so what's the performative contradiction between

(1:44:49) somebody in group a who says it's okay to have sex with a corpse and in group b they say it's not you say that you can

(1:44:55) logically determine that you can only logically make an argument against them by showing a contradiction so show the

(1:45:00) contradiction well because your penis will be smelly nice not a contradiction nice what's the

(1:45:07) contradiction bro so what I'm what I'm saying is if there's okay if there's if

(1:45:12) there's two individuals both agree that let's say necrophilia is is wrong not just yucky like yeah Alex here but like

(1:45:19) two people both say that it's wrong yeah both people say it's wrong but both people say that the other one's

(1:45:26) worldview is incorrect they both have come to this this conclusion about something somebody has to be correct

(1:45:33) yeah yeah so where's the contradiction how we know which one's correct without

(1:45:39) the contradiction so in order to dig out the contradiction wouldn't you have to use logic and examine both people that's

(1:45:46) what I'm asking you I'm asking you to use logic to show me the contradiction why it's wrong to have sex with a corpse

(1:45:51) show me tell me tell me logically why it's wrong can you do that or not yeah I would say it's wrong because I

(1:45:57) have picked a moral code that tells me that it's wrong and so if somebody else picks a

(1:46:03) moral code that tells them that it's right why would they be wrong well we would have to observe we would

(1:46:09) have to observe their worldview correct their World Views it's not wrong you dance

(1:46:19) yeah please anybody can argue for him holy [ __ ]

(1:46:27) against necrophilia would be that it would be dishonoring and disrespecting

(1:46:32) the dead because the dead once once a person dies

(1:46:37) they don't have a free will of Their Own they have a right not to get [ __ ]

(1:46:43) after they die hang on so let's so let's back up hang

(1:46:48) on you think you think you think in your world view necrophilia is wrong because

(1:46:54) a person has uh right to not be disrespected after death yes and what

(1:46:59) gives them that right men because that's

(1:47:04) because they don't have a free will of their own they don't have their life at their their life Essence has been this

(1:47:10) is all begging the question what gives them the right stop begging the question right you just keep you're just reaffirming the question I know what the

(1:47:17) question is because I just asked it why is it why is it wrong okay here let me

(1:47:22) let me try to explain a potential contradiction would be that as a human being your goal is to reproduce having

(1:47:28) sex with a corpse is contrary to your uh natural uh I don't know uh purpose yeah

(1:47:36) yeah so that that could be one for example Grace you don't believe in natural law you know what I mean that

(1:47:43) you're not a naturalist you're a Catholic Roman Catholics believe in that what's natural law Grace

(1:47:50) the law of nature the law of what God provides the law of nature yeah

(1:47:57) tell me tell me what law system is for having children and so sex should not be

(1:48:04) had in a way that isn't going open to the possibility of children okay

(1:48:09) then how come if that's a law a natural law how come people can get pregnant

(1:48:16) outside of marriage Grace yeah it's not it's not a law like it's not a

(1:48:22) not a legal law it's a natural law that's well then it's not a law it's a human nature then it's not a law it's

(1:48:27) the law of nature you just said it's a law of nature realistic no you just said yeah

(1:48:33) you think the phrase natural law means something that's enforced by judges

(1:48:38) what is it it's the way that it's human nature it's the way that nature works

(1:48:45) it's the way that nature works so you would say that nature Works in this way that if you have sex with a woman they get pregnant

(1:48:51) yes so how's that violation of natural log race

(1:49:02) because to a man and a woman have sex to reproduce a child that the man and woman should both take care of the child so

(1:49:08) that's why it's against Natural why does any of that require marriage Grace well because marriage is the most

(1:49:13) fitting way for two people yeah but you can still have the child but you can still have the child outside of that you

(1:49:20) can still have the child outside of that hang on hang on what makes it unnatural to do so

(1:49:27) well because naturally what really well there's two words you can have those things without a marriage you just conceded that

(1:49:33) no that's that's what a marriage is you can have that absent marriage

(1:49:39) how can you have that absent marriage that's what marriage is 2 no marriage is a Sacrament a religious

(1:49:45) Sacrament right Catholic you're a Catholic Sacrament but are you married in the Catholic are you married in the

(1:49:52) Catholic church if you shack up with a woman for Life Grace no no because it's a Sacrament right

(1:49:57) Grace so how come you can say that that's natural law how can you say it's natural law that if two people shack up

(1:50:03) for life that that makes no sense well marriage is natural it's just the church recognizing and confirming something

(1:50:10) that is natural it's also a Sacrament but it is natural law in the sense that it's the it's the natural way for two

(1:50:17) people to raise a child in the most healthy way possible yeah what makes it natural if there's no Sacrament required

(1:50:24) why should a person become Catholic and engage in the sacrament if there's no if there's a violation of natural law

(1:50:30) what's the punishment for the violation of natural law what is the punishment for the violation

(1:50:37) of natural law I guess that you will be unhappy because you're doing things that are unnatural they're not good oh right

(1:50:43) yeah all these degens they seem real [ __ ] unhappy when we're arguing with them don't they all they do is make the

(1:50:48) case that pleasure is the maximum pleasure is everything that's what they're always arguing could you argue

(1:50:54) then that Hedonism is part of natural law since that seems to be the predilection of most people to move towards that

(1:51:00) well I mean no because because natural law is sort of like morality right it's

(1:51:06) like kind of like what it's like a guideline to help us live the best lives possible right so like the sacrament

(1:51:12) there is no natural law the sacrament adds God's grace so it's God's law not natural law there is no laws of nature

(1:51:20) a lot of made nature well I mean God by by this logic though God made everything right

(1:51:26) yes okay so if God made everything does that mean that the people he made who are hedonists are supposed to be

(1:51:32) hedonists no because for them not following naturally no one is their own misery for

(1:51:38) example if you have a lot of sex sex will become something that doesn't Bond you you can't produce children in a

(1:51:44) healthy way you won't have a good family life Etc et cetera et cetera the punishment is your own misery is that

(1:51:49) true in every case so that's the natural law is that true in every case

(1:51:56) in every case can you demonstrate that it's true in every case that people live their whole life after having a child

(1:52:01) outside of wedlock with each other and they shack up for the rest of their life that they're not happy till the very day they die can you demonstrate that

(1:52:08) well they don't have a marriage a sacramental marriage you're saying they don't have a marriage they're not married they decided not to get married

(1:52:14) we don't want to be married they just shack up for the rest of their entire lives yes okay I can I can yes

(1:52:22) because if they never if they never commit to each other and that God's grace is not added to that marriage then

(1:52:27) they will never they will both they never have a commitment to each other that's not they did commit to each other

(1:52:32) they committed to each other they did they looked at each other they looked at each other got married they looked at

(1:52:39) each other and they said we're going to commit to each other for the rest of our lives

(1:52:47) because they don't want to get married I don't know because she doesn't want to they don't want to well there must be

(1:52:52) they just don't feel they don't feel like it why wouldn't they want their commitment perhaps they don't want a chick to take half their [ __ ] let's say

(1:52:57) that okay well okay well I mean that's a very specific I could even see that like

(1:53:04) that's that's saying that they have an issue with the laws of divorce and stuff okay that's basically marriage though

(1:53:10) that's basically marriage it's not marriage marriage Society if we get married and like even married by the

(1:53:17) Catholic church but our marriage is recognized by civil law and that means that they're you know you can get privately married but what you're

(1:53:24) essentially describing is a private marriage can you get privately married married uh by the Catholic Church

(1:53:31) well I mean you can Romeo and Juliet right I mean you can get private Romeo and Juliet were married

(1:53:38) and make a commitment for Julia we're married you can make yes

(1:53:43) yes it's a valid marriage if you commit to somebody you don't have to have a representative there if you commit to

(1:53:49) somebody you don't have to two people can get married in a desert where did Romeo and Juliet get married

(1:53:55) it's they didn't get formally married you're you're making a distinction between formal so checking up with a

(1:54:00) chick so you heard it here ladies and gentlemen shacking up with a chick for the rest of your life that's marriage genius Grace brilliant stuff well if you

(1:54:08) personally if it's a private marriage and you don't want to get civilly married because you don't agree with the

(1:54:13) laws around civil marriage that's still a marriage it's essentially a commitment to the other person for life that is a

(1:54:20) marriage now two people if two people just decide to live with you so what's the sacrament for so what's the

(1:54:25) sacrament add God's grace into to so that's what makes it a legitimate marriage right Grace no no it's not what makes it a

(1:54:33) legitimate marriage what makes it a legitimate marriage

(1:54:39) through those two people both make us a solid vow that's right

(1:54:44) whatever you say Do not would you not say that if two people are in a desert to die and they

(1:54:52) they arguing to argue I don't know what she's even at this point

(1:54:58) I was just arguing to argument your circular yeah just keep talking

(1:55:03) just keep talking the the priest you're just arguing to argue there to be

(1:55:09) a witness yo shut up I just want to know if everything fits I want to know if Andrew thinks it's okay to [ __ ] a corpse

(1:55:16) okay finally a question why why not I want to get back to since since you brought up

(1:55:23) the corpse [ __ ] thing I want to get back to that because

(1:55:28) Andrew was asking uh like how you know that that's objective and so um obviously as someone's worldview

(1:55:36) that's subjective that's not objective but that is a good answer obviously people are going to have different World Views there's different Christians who

(1:55:42) are going to have different world views on that I'm sure there's people who are going to claim Christian who oh there's no there's not a single Christian on

(1:55:48) planet Earth give me a single no no give me even an

(1:55:54) adult Tech that believes in necrophilia's main argument so that's

(1:55:59) just you know obviously there's going to be obviously you know there's going to be people who claim every ideology who you know believe in whatever but what

(1:56:06) what makes things quote unquote objective morality what makes it objective is that we've evolved these

(1:56:12) traits over time we have amygdalas and people share these moralities objectively between everyone and the

(1:56:19) reason we share these moralities is because we've evolved them the people who didn't have these moralities were likely ostracized

(1:56:26) and you know kicked out of their cultures and killed so we've evolved to

(1:56:31) have these sort of ideologies like not [ __ ] corpses and not murdering others and like responsible then why do people

(1:56:37) do it because people are psychopaths and those people are they evolved to be Psycho or

(1:56:43) they evolve to be Psychopaths no I mean did people evolve to be mentally deficient I mean they must have if they evolve to

(1:56:50) have moral codes no I mean you so you're saying people with Down Syndrome evolved to be that

(1:56:56) way well no I'm not saying that I'm asking if you have a person who looks just like you operates just like you but

(1:57:02) uh but it's some type of sociopath let's say a socialist wouldn't operate just like me they might have how do you mean

(1:57:08) it's a minute no no stop stop let me answer or ask my question

(1:57:13) how do you know a sociopath isn't evolved to be a sociopath because they are in a small percentage of society so

(1:57:20) what that is so then homosexuals also are not evolved to be homosexuals yeah I

(1:57:26) mean I never said that it's a completely different argument okay so then that doesn't make it normal right but that's

(1:57:32) absolutely different things

(1:57:41) someone being homosexual isn't going against what people's amygdala is telling them when people see people

(1:57:47) you're not with sensual I I need to respond to the homosexuality thing because I know the argument you're

(1:57:52) trying to make what am I what's the argument I'm trying to make well you're trying to say that well homosexuality sexuality is in the small percentages

(1:58:00) your evolutionary worldview by and this is not even what evolutionists believe

(1:58:05) but by your world view you would have to concede that all percentiles of minority

(1:58:10) groups regardless of what they were were not evolved to be in that minority group what's the percentage uh uh differential

(1:58:18) to break out of that mold how many need to be in the group before we know they weren't evolved to be in this particular

(1:58:25) group can you tell me that well what's the percentage when it when it's in a standard deviation when it's in uh about

(1:58:33) three standard deviations above average I'd say that they're probably not in the evolutionary Elite you know what I mean

(1:58:40) there's a reason that they're so what's the evolutionary Elite that might be elite if they're rare well people who

(1:58:47) are average you know people who evolve to be the way that they are right now because that doesn't that doesn't happen

(1:58:53) that doesn't answer any questions of evolution we have become this does not answer my question this is just what

(1:58:58) you're associating my question is what's the delineation breaker for we know this group didn't evolve to be this way

(1:59:04) because everybody evolved to be this way how do we know which evolve to be which way

(1:59:10) it's percentages who who is the average yeah what's the percentage I don't know exactly the percentages

(1:59:18) deviation if people one percent one percent can be an average

(1:59:23) one percent can be an average because if you have 51 percent of people do X and

(1:59:29) 48 of people do X isn't the 51 percent the average sure but it's okay well then then if you

(1:59:37) have 40 people having sex with corpses no you don't but that's not really my

(1:59:43) point you said it's based on averages you said that you know deviations

(1:59:50) it's based off of who's around the average not based off of the exact averages or the means or anything

(1:59:56) based around the averages so they're so average so on average these people do everything else every other Homo Sapien

(2:00:03) does except this one thing and you're saying that they weren't evolved through that one thing prove it

(2:00:10) how would I prove it it's just yeah obviously I don't have the any studies

(2:00:17) right now but you could have a hundred people in a room ask them why necrophilia is bad religion or or not

(2:00:22) and 99 of them are going to say yes that's disgusting that's abholent so there's always because of religion it's

(2:00:29) not because of some moral code it's due to their amygdala it's because so tell me this that's ourselves

(2:00:34) yeah yeah okay do you believe that morals what is moral is what you evolved

(2:00:40) to do yes absolutely okay so why is why is rape wrong

(2:00:45) we haven't been involved to write oh we haven't a well yeah there's a reason why when you

(2:00:51) see rape you find it either abhorrent or disgusting it's because they're all societies think that and traditionally

(2:00:57) have not thought that there's many societies which don't uh in any way shape or form give any uh Credence to

(2:01:03) rape whatsoever they don't give a [ __ ] about it well you can say that but you don't know their own perspective right the whole

(2:01:10) society doesn't care they have laws which respect them in and treat the women like chattel they don't give a

(2:01:17) [ __ ] okay and that and we'll buy that same artists there's Christian societies who

(2:01:23) have had slaves so I mean you know they didn't give a [ __ ] either obviously this is the critique of your worldview for

(2:01:30) evolution so the critique in your worldview of evolution is that only things are moral that we were evolved to

(2:01:36) do you don't think that men were evolved to commit rape though so the problem with things like that

(2:01:42) with things like rape or cultures that have been normal have things normalized or have had certain cultures demonized

(2:01:47) against them is is those are very particular case-by-case scenarios that you have to break down all countries

(2:01:54) there's cultures that have used religion to successfully dehumanize right women

(2:01:59) in within Society so that people don't care about right women so women

(2:02:05) if you take a person who wasn't if I just had a natural setting and I guess

(2:02:11) this is just a bet but women women

(2:02:20) were evolved to wear burkas just say it no that's religion religion religious

(2:02:26) people you're not revolved how are you not evolved to follow a religion considering the average is that

(2:02:32) everybody does almost everything two thousand years

(2:02:40) with our philosophy and the reason we developed these philosophy is also due to Evolution so do you want to know why

(2:02:46) do you want to know why we have developed these sort of philosophies in my opinion uh from The evolutionary worldview you

(2:02:54) would say it's for the purpose of self-preservation and the continuance of humankind yes that's exactly why I'm

(2:02:59) glad you know the answer that's because I understand Evolution you don't understand Evolution you don't

(2:03:04) understand that Evolution happens to the entire group all of the group at the same time at the same rate over an

(2:03:11) elongated period of genetic mutations happens some are negative and stop cutting me off let me finish and then

(2:03:17) I'll let you finish okay it happens over an elongated period of time to an entire

(2:03:22) group over that elongated period of time which means you shouldn't have middle

(2:03:27) easterners who are evolved to want to put burkas on women and women to want to put the burkas on but they do that [ __ ]

(2:03:33) you say well this is just cultural it has nothing to do with Evolution but everything including religion you just

(2:03:39) conceded is part of the evolutionary mechanism so they were evolved to do it because human philosophy is somewhat

(2:03:46) flawed it causes us to contradict our own morals Evolution made a mistake

(2:03:52) in some ways it did because it made it with you bro [Laughter]

(2:04:03) hold up can I jump can I jump in here sure Andrew I feel like Andrew's always doing

(2:04:10) the interrogating I I just want to know how far Andrew can get with the line of questioning like Andrew is it okay to

(2:04:17) [ __ ] a corpse no why not uh because God commands that you can't

(2:04:23) how do you know that I know it because my worldview is the only thing which uh has a justification

(2:04:30) for epistemology and ontology um you're when you say that you mean all

(2:04:36) of Christianity or your your brand of Christianity God God period is the only thing so you

(2:04:44) have to at least start with the groundwork of understanding that there's transcendental categories which exist you would agree that that's true right

(2:04:51) of course yeah okay so what are the transcendental categories which exist

(2:04:59) um well there's I'm talking about transcendental

(2:05:04) categories um I don't know you don't know so you agree that they

(2:05:11) exist but you don't know what they are next question please how dumb are you [ __ ] people I just

(2:05:18) like I don't even get it at this point how [ __ ] dumb are you people I'm here I have a very serious question going

(2:05:25) through Andrew have you ever had like a hardcore like religion before that guy

(2:05:31) who just left come back come back I'm just [ __ ] with you I'm just I'm just messing around so like I'm not trying to ostracize you respond to this the thing

(2:05:39) about Muslim cultures real quick there's a there's a reason the reasons they did not evolve to be that way

(2:05:47) get to that bro I'll get to that in a second those things those things have developed over the past 2 000 years it's

(2:05:53) not it's a very least yeah go ahead

(2:05:59) two-part question so first part is have you ever had a uh religious experience where you like feel like God

(2:06:04) communicated with you or spoke to you or anything like that me personally yeah all the time yeah

(2:06:10) okay so here's the part two to this what if during your next uh spiritual experience God said Andrew I want to

(2:06:18) tell you it's okay to [ __ ] corpses would you actually change your perspective no that would go against the ontological

(2:06:24) nature of God so God's nature is unchanging so it's very ontology is to be an unchanging unvarying

(2:06:31) personification in fact that question proves the Demonic so I would know that

(2:06:36) it was a demon because or a demon who was trying to tell me to do X thing

(2:06:42) because I would know that the ontology that God would never ask me to do such a thing but Andrew we can make so much money on

(2:06:49) the only fans

(2:06:55) are buried how does God talk to you like what it I mean what has he said to you

(2:07:02) uh well I can well I can think all right so I can thank and I have a Consciousness if I can think and I have

(2:07:09) a Consciousness and I understand that there's a mind then the thoughts that come into my head that I think are not

(2:07:15) my own especially when I'm in prayer I think that that would be a position of God communicating with me yeah how would

(2:07:21) you do you think that you hear other voices in your head that are not yours you don't hear other voices in your head

(2:07:26) bro

(2:07:35) how do you know that your inner monologue is your voice because I can control what it says I can say how do

(2:07:40) you know your inner monologue that's not my question it's not my question listen to my question how do you know your

(2:07:46) inner monologue is your actual voice I can say whatever I want it to say

(2:07:52) that's not my question and you hear yourself like your voice your own voice

(2:07:57) can you hear it inside of your own head your physical voice has nothing to do with your uh so how do you know then so

(2:08:05) how do you know if you can't hear your physical voice in your head that it's actually you because if I want to think

(2:08:10) right now I [ __ ] a corpse I can think it and it'll say that in my head how do you know that that's you thinking it

(2:08:17) because I can control it how do you know that that's you controlling it because I can what do you mean that I

(2:08:24) know that it can control me how do I know answer my question I'm controlling it well I'm not I don't know how you

(2:08:30) would know that that's my question to you how do you know that that's actually your voice I'll answer it with your own way with your own answer you know you

(2:08:37) wouldn't know that there's no way to know that obviously right there's no way for you to know that so then your earlier claim of you know that for sure

(2:08:42) that's you telling you to do this thing is false [ __ ] idiot okay so if you if you pray to God and

(2:08:50) you decide we're done if I pray to God if I pray to God right

(2:08:57) now and I decide to think something abhorrent is that God telling me that we're definitely dude dude it's done

(2:09:04) it's already done move on next next caller wait what's done we're not finished we haven't finished the point

(2:09:10) okay go ahead restate your question we'll do it again so if I were to be praying right now and I thought about a

(2:09:16) demonic thing something you'd consider demonic is that God telling me that thing or it's a demon telling me that

(2:09:22) thing don't you understand what just happened you just admitted that you don't

(2:09:27) actually know if the voice in your own head is your voice or not and then you're gonna question me on how you know

(2:09:32) it's demonic or not I I do know that you are admitting you don't know that and okay so you're

(2:09:38) unsure okay your own thoughts fair enough we'll do it again you're sure then that that's your voice

(2:09:45) I don't have to have a necessary reasoning for why I know for a fact that it's my voice okay well then if you have

(2:09:50) no arguments if you have no arguments how do you know that it's God okay wait

(2:09:58) I'll just use the on your own argument against you so when you're praying to God for sure it's your own voice again when

(2:10:04) when you're praying to God and you're hearing these thoughts that you consider holy how do you know that they're God

(2:10:09) do you know what the legismi is no I don't know anything about religion I know all right so I I yeah I don't I

(2:10:16) don't waste my time educating myself on on nonsense you don't waste your time educating yourself on everything which

(2:10:22) influences politics policy the human behavior yeah

(2:10:29) two thousand years okay so let's go back to the little geese me I'll explain to you what it is lagizme is an example in

(2:10:37) Orthodoxy and it what it's stating is that most of the thoughts that you have probably are not your own thoughts right

(2:10:43) you can have a distinguishing Factor so what I just told you what it's according to

(2:10:49) what do you mean according to Orthodoxy so why why should I have any reason to accept that

(2:10:55) be well we were just going through that earlier because of transcendental categories do you want to go through why you should believe in Orthodoxy

(2:11:03) no I don't care why should I believe in this one specific Doctrine that's

(2:11:09) telling me I'm trying to tell you borderline what most psychologists would consider schizophrenia you're not

(2:11:15) listening and I'm trying to explain it to you I'm trying to answer your question well you're trying to tell me

(2:11:20) why don't you believe that my own thoughts aren't my own that yourself I'm just telling you from

(2:11:26) my perspective and from most normal people's perspective that would be crazy that would be something that you'd hear

(2:11:31) in a mental ward right I I know hang on thoughts on my own according to those bro according to the legisli I know the

(2:11:39) thoughts were thinking is you don't even know I'm just telling

(2:11:45) you an example you don't know [ __ ] about it it's you so you can hear the Ridiculousness of the statement that

(2:11:50) you're making what is the Ridiculousness of the statement that I'm making I'm just repeating it to you so you can

(2:11:56) hear it I don't need it for yourself I don't need to explain to you if you need anything

(2:12:01) sexual comprehension to understand why that's a ridiculous statement then I mean I don't need to be your third grade

(2:12:07) teacher to explain it to you but so so just say I have no argument just do that so you're so you're saying if someone

(2:12:14) told you that the thoughts they were hearing were from some random God that had nothing to do with yours you're you're going to assume they're just some

(2:12:20) normal person and that's according to the legies me that's why they're hearing those thoughts no that's not my position tell me my

(2:12:27) position no I don't need to tell you a position you can because you don't listen to me okay so you don't know what my position

(2:12:32) is you told me in my position your position is that only schizophrenic

(2:12:37) people or uh people who have no internal monologue wouldn't know that they have

(2:12:42) their own internal monologue that's your position I never said only schizophrenic people I said what you said right now if

(2:12:49) I told that to a psychologist they would consider that to be schizophrenic or I would consider that was right here

(2:12:56) people would have that position no no you weren't right because if you say only there's a there's a huge

(2:13:05) bucket all you do bucket list of of psychological decisions this isn't a

(2:13:10) conversation you just won't shut up you have to shut the [ __ ] up or we can't because I have to respond what you say

(2:13:16) yeah but how long does it take you to finish a point like should I get a timer should we have Alex do 30 seconds let's

(2:13:22) do that otherwise you just filibuster you don't say anything very soon so let's just get to like

(2:13:28) final points all right well here's my final point my final point is this whole panel got blown out by me

(2:13:35) with ease again and it was simple but to be fair the only reason is because all

(2:13:42) of you are [ __ ] stupid and I'm super smart other than that there's no there's like there's no other reason for it

(2:13:47) really right but that's that's what happened or maybe you're just normal and we're super stupid

(2:13:55) I love this guy this guy's a [ __ ] G hey by the way it's a joke he's the only one who got the [ __ ] joke only guy

(2:14:02) another joke that's why that's why my response was

(2:14:07) just like doing the like the slow knot so Andrew what yeah what uh what Bible

(2:14:13) do you think is the right bible to read I mean it's a real question and I don't

(2:14:18) know much about the Bible I've never read it but do you think there's a right well it's according to it is changing

(2:14:24) the thing he doesn't know what it is still doesn't know what it is but quotes of me it's so funny what if the legisby

(2:14:33) what if the legisby just met people with blue watches like you wouldn't know claws me I know why that race is good

(2:14:40) all right well I mean according to your name is sweetie Todd there's nothing nothing coming out of you that's ever

(2:14:45) going to be serious anyway anyway back to you based Oracle it sounds like you don't have a legitimate retort if you do

(2:14:52) an excellent argument was wow you're really stupid you have no response no you ended the debate

(2:14:58) is over so you have many arguments how many more arguments do I need to give you if you don't have a choice of what

(2:15:04) I'm saying and you have to

(2:15:10) out of you and it was easy I I've said the same things

(2:15:17) it was bad it was bad it was especially the evolution was [ __ ] cringe

(2:15:24) specifically which was great you said that people didn't evolve to have religion and then retracted it and said

(2:15:30) they did you're so [ __ ] stupid it's unbelievable you actually said specifically religion is something that well specifically monotheistic religion

(2:15:37) is something that we've developed over the past 2000 years so we didn't evolve from monotheism well

(2:15:44) Evolution hasn't really happened over the past 2000 years so so what if we didn't evolve from monotheism we only

(2:15:51) our monotheists due to the things we have been for a majority of human civilization we have been paid and let

(2:15:58) me finish my question you don't even know what I'm gonna say of humans say

(2:16:04) you're still filibustering you're still spurging okay

(2:16:09) stillsberging all right I think I'll be here between both of you let's let Tyrese ask

(2:16:16) this question go ahead um what about me oh sorry you just asked

(2:16:22) a question about what I know he didn't answer it yet he didn't answer all right let's let him answer that and they'll let Sharif in the whole uh okay nice

(2:16:31) it was about the Bible yeah yeah so I would start with the Orthodox Study Bible and it'll give you a reference

(2:16:37) point for why each and everything and the source for why each and everything inside of that reference Bible is true

(2:16:44) that way you can do the research yourself so I would start with that start with the Orthodox Study Bible which has the citations so you can go to

(2:16:52) the source okay to reforthodoxy obvious yeah okay

(2:16:59) um for the for the most part Andrew I agree with your world view that we

(2:17:04) should be religiously Pious and that we should we should for the most part

(2:17:11) abstain from pleasures and we should you know be more devoted to God and and devout

(2:17:20) ourselves to certain Works whether it be in a Christian way or Islamic way or

(2:17:25) Judaica or Hindu way or Janeway you get the point and but

(2:17:31) the question is uh what about in indulging or

(2:17:37) or in or rather involving ourselves in Pleasures at least in moderation

(2:17:46) well I don't I don't think that pleasure is is evil or bad right I'm not I'm not

(2:17:52) some some kind of like uh Puritan man Orthodox aren't Puritan like I enjoy having a drink for instance I take great

(2:17:59) pleasure in that I smoke I take great pleasure in that too I don't think that that's what Hedonism is though is

(2:18:05) experiencing pleasure uh I experienced a lot of pleasure with my wife I'm sure a lot of you guys out there experience

(2:18:11) pleasure with your wives things like this that's not really Hedonism Hedonism would be saying that the greatest amount

(2:18:18) of pleasure is what makes the thing moral that's the problem yeah Terry if a little Corp sex

(2:18:24) is okay in moderation but you want to overdo it you want to be at the cemetery every night not the argument what's the

(2:18:30) argument that I made was not moderation I didn't make the argument for moderation it made the argument that

(2:18:37) saying that maximum pleasure is what makes something moral is incorrect not that moderation is moral that's not the

(2:18:44) argument I made Alex okay okay not too much Corps sex I got it uh no Corps sex

(2:18:53) who the [ __ ] is going to become a [ __ ] Christian with no Corps sex I mean that's like the best thing about life I don't think any of you djans will

(2:18:59) so that's not good I don't think any of you teach Ed squill I just I just

(2:19:05) indulge myself in Pleasures in moderation it's like a little bit of corpse sex right

(2:19:11) I don't know I don't know about that well I think Temperance is a virtue that's true so I think moderation is

(2:19:17) good um and I think an absence of moderation leads to evil and leads to things that I

(2:19:22) would consider immoral for sure but just the idea just the idea of like pleasure in and of itself or pain in and of

(2:19:28) itself being moral or immoral just based on the quality of what they are I think is incorrect that's true yeah I would

(2:19:36) actually agree with you on that one all right anyway guys I do want to wrap up because we're going for two hours and 20

(2:19:41) minutes uh that was a fun stream hey thanks for having me on guys I appreciate everybody on the panel even
