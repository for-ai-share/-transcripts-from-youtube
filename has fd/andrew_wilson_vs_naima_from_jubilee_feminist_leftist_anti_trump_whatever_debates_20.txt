(1:28) without further ado I will introduce our two guests i'm joined today by Andrew

() 

(1:33) Wilson host of The Crucible he's a Blood Sports debater and political commentator

(1:39) also joining us today is Naima she's a senior at University of Southern

(1:45) California she's a political commentator and content creator the topic today is

(1:51) feminism you will each have up to a five-minute opening statement and then the rest of the show will just be open

(1:59) conversation possible prompt changes and we're going to have breaks for messages from the audience andrew you're going to

(2:05) go first with your opening statement so please go ahead yeah so my position on

() 

(2:11) feminism is that um it's terrible for society um as we go through this I'll

(2:16) kind of flesh that view out using what I call force doctrine so that you can understand why I have that same set but

(2:22) force doctrine basically just states that uh while feminism definitionally is

(2:27) the movement towards egalitarianism and equity for the removal of patriarchal systems that feminist will always have

(2:34) to appeal to patriarchy in order to try to remove patriarchy which is ironically

(2:39) hilarious but a few things I wanted to get to first is that I went through several hours of my opponent's content

(2:46) and I've actually not ever seen her make a single argument for anything that she believes not I've seen her assert a lot

(2:53) of things but not an argument for anything she actually believes so I have some notes here and I was hoping she

(2:59) could help me clear some of these things up from the surrounded September 8th 2024 episode she says "Abortion is

(3:05) murder." uh or I'm sorry the prompt is abortion is murder and should be illegal she asked for a viability time for 20

(3:12) weeks and thinks abortion before 20 weeks is acceptable she says the fetus is technically classified as a parasite

(3:18) the fetus cannot uh exist outside of the womb and therefore is a parasite the actual definitions don't support this an

(3:25) organism living in on or with another organism in order to obtain nutrients grow multiply uh that would be an actual

(3:32) definition of a parasite or someone or something that resembles a biological parasite living off of being dependent

(3:39) on or exploring another um fetuses can't fit that definitionally fetus is the

(3:45) same species biological parasites are classified as other not the same species also u mutual biology mothers and fetus

(3:54) co co-adapt and mothers are actually healthier while they're pregnant so it can't really be a parasite um and um

(4:02) parasites are rarely temporary and fetuses are so and none of that fits the criteria for a parasite on her video

(4:08) Middle Ground progressives versus moderates and this is from January 19th uh she says the prompt is does the far

(4:16) left uh make Democrats lose elections she said Kamla was not progressive

(4:21) enough not far-left enough um she talks about how women's rights are being stripped but didn't give any examples of

(4:27) what those are so I'm actually really confused about um a lot of her positions

(4:32) including in her rematch against Charlie Kirk that happened March 5th 2025 why DEI is unlawful um her re her rebuttal

(4:40) to Kirk was bizarre it just had something to do with there's no racial factor in DEI even though Kirk gave a

(4:46) pretty good rebuttal for that so I'd like her to kind of dive into what she actually believes within within the

(4:53) paradigm of feminism um but for my positive position I will say I have a

(4:58) logical argument called force doctrine and my logical argument called force doctrine refutes the feminist ideology

(5:06) and it just works as I explained before um that uh patriarchy must always be

(5:12) appealed to in order to try to eliminate patriarchy women can't enforce their own rights collectively and men can

(5:19) therefore women always have to appeal collectively to men for their rights so you're always going to essentially have

(5:24) a patriarchy through forced doctrine and there's nothing women can do about that so I'm willing to logically go through

(5:30) that and have it examined rigorously but I'm hoping that with that um you can

(5:36) also describe your positions so that I understand them better all right thank you Andrew if you'd like

(5:42) to give your opening statement yes thank you Andrew um you know I do think that that is an interesting claim that I

(5:50) don't you know state my arguments because I've actually been watching some of your content and I've noticed kind of

(5:55) a similar trend as well within these debates where you will ask your debate

(6:00) or questions but will not put forth your argument including in your opening statement you know you state force doctrine but instead of elaborating on

(6:07) it you consistently talk about what I've talked about which only one of those topics was actually related to feminism

(6:14) now when it comes to my actual beliefs I think my goal and my hope for this country is to see us advance as a

(6:19) society i would like to see everyone have bodily autonomy and I would like for the vast majority of people if not

(6:25) everyone to have their basic needs met and I would like to mitigate any unnecessary conflict between the

(6:31) citizens of this country genuinely I think that my main issue with the manosphere and with your force doctrine

(6:37) principle is that it promotes and spreads divisiveness against men and women it promotes and spreads violence

(6:43) against men and women and it exaggerates and focuses the difference the differences between the genders i think

(6:49) that men and women I mean I don't think I know men and women are the same species we are 99% genetically similar

(6:55) and the obsessive need to define and separate people based on one singular chromosome is doing both men and women a

(7:02) disservice socially economically and politically which we can get into um I'm

(7:08) ready to open it up if you want to yeah i guess actually I'd love to start with a question for you um I would like to go

(7:15) back to the force doctrine theory if we can i just kind of want to

() 

(7:21) understand more i've know you've talked a lot about the equal force objection in the past you've said men have

(7:27) essentially a monopoly on force correct if I'm correct okay perfect um and do you want me to walk you through the argument no I'm I'm going to elaborate

(7:34) thank you and that rights exist through physical force and that our legal system is based on physical force mhm um so I

(7:41) guess I kind of just want to hear you elaborate on that now if you're welcome so you want my argument for the force

(7:46) doctrine yep okay so what force doctrine is saying is very simple that feminism

(7:53) if you at least agree with my definition and it seems broadly feminists do yeah that it's a movement towards egalitarianism and equity and the

(8:00) removal of patriarchy they if you can't have an oppressed class without an oppressor class at least not from the

(8:06) Marxist feminist view in the case if women are being oppressed they're not being oppressed by wolves they're being

(8:12) oppressed by men right so if that's the case then my argument to them is that

(8:19) whatever you believe this oppression is you will actually have to appeal to men

(8:24) in order to either relinquish whatever this oppression is uh or um concede to

(8:30) whatever it is that they want because collectively women actually cannot overthrow any patriarchal systems they

(8:36) rely on the force of men and so if men anytime they want to decide to remove women's rights there's actually not

(8:42) anything women can do about it but the opposition is not true the opposite is not true women cannot collectivize and

(8:47) take away men's rights okay so are you essentially saying that women do not deserve the right to fight for their own

(8:54) freed yeah that's an a claim i'm not making an a claim i'm trying to get us to the

(8:59) descriptor first so instead of making a prescriptive statement I'm starting with a descriptive statement what is true and

(9:05) then we can worry about what it's what should be true after we can determine what is true okay but I'm trying to see

(9:10) like structurally how does that work in the real world are you saying that women should not fight for their rights

(9:16) because they Listen let's back up so I can distinguish two things okay is ought

() 

(9:22) right i'm not trying to bridge the is ought gap i'm trying to start with a descriptive claim so if if the

(9:30) descriptive claim is true then we can move through the to the prescriptive side of it but right now you would

(9:36) either need to agree with me that descriptively I'm right or that descriptively I'm wrong i can't agree

(9:42) with you to say that descriptively you're right until you apply what you're saying in theory to the practice of

(9:47) modern day society how does your equal force objection how does this principle

(9:53) work in society what are you saying in terms Yeah i think that because that is

(10:00) the case that men deserve to have uh various privileges that they're not given in society okay which they should

(10:05) be given in society so what are the privileges that you think that men should have that women should not have well primarily I think that if you're

(10:13) going to look at an equalization what I would do pre prescriptively would be to roll voting back and that's for both

(10:19) sexes i think that rolling voting back for both sexes is a good idea and have some sort of perhaps like um one house

() 

(10:28) voting system or one marriage voting system or people who have done some sort of collective service to the state for a

(10:34) voting system i think that those things would all be very good systems for everybody now I would apply that hang on

(10:41) I would apply that broadly to men and I would apply that to women i think that

(10:46) right now men get the shaft because men are men are required to do a lot of jobs

(10:53) that women are not which keeps society going and women are not doing those things and because of that I don't

(11:00) understand why it is that women can nullify their votes and disenfranchise them and most importantly vote to send

(11:06) them to wars they don't have to go fight in so you would like to disenfranchise both the men and women's mostly most of

(11:13) them yes I think would be a better idea achieve well it would be the it would achieve the same thing our founders

(11:18) basically wanted to achieve which is that they thought that you would have to have a stake in the country in order to vote but if you live in the country and

(11:25) if you exist in the country and if you're being legislated by the laws that the country is making don't you have a stake in that no not always in fact many

(11:32) times you don't many times many people actually get more back from the state than they put into the state so that's

(11:37) at the expense of other people who is that so there's lots of people who pay who get a ma a mass amount back from the

(11:44) government that they never pay to the government this can happen through things like uh social security disability things like welfare uh things

(11:52) like even earned income child credit that you may receive even though you don't actually pay anything into the system or very little into the system

(11:58) but those are it's a crime to lie on your taxes and commit isn't that tax fraud to claim a dependent no no there's

(12:05) just tax fraud i'm saying there's people who get more out of the system than they put

(12:11) into the system okay but they're still at stake because they still live here now are their lives not at stake if

(12:17) we're legislating them but that that wouldn't follow that because they live here they deserve the right to vote though yes it's I mean no taxation

(12:24) without representation that's the point of representative democracy is that everyone is represented then how come the founding fathers didn't give

(12:30) everybody the right to vote from the beginning i mean the founding fathers also endorsed and owned slaves do you agree with child slavery just let her

(12:36) finish go ahead i mean the founding fathers also endorsed and own slaves do you believe in child slavery so so you

(12:43) do realize that they could do bad thing right I can agree that's bad thing but

(12:48) that has nothing relationally to do with how they set up the system of government i mean I thought this was going to be a

(12:53) debate on feminism honestly I think that's kind of wild because it sounds like you're disenfranchising men so who do you think would be are you trying to

(13:00) I'm not disenfranch I'm not disenfranchising men calm down i'll explain if you're taking away the votes

(13:06) of a man because he is not um I guess landowning is that what the what's the criteria for having a vote i think

(13:12) ultimately more men would be voting because they would have more stake so can I ask can every man go to prison

(13:19) okay if they commit a crime they can go to prison everyone can do that yes okay and everyone is in this country has to

(13:27) abide by the laws of this country otherwise they will go to prison yes okay so why wouldn't they be allowed to

(13:33) vote on the representatives that define those laws if they that is a stake if you can go to prison for committing a

(13:39) crime that is created by the government then you do have a stake legislatively in the laws that the government creates

(13:45) that still wouldn't follow that you would need to vote yes you would need to vote you want to vote for the representatives that create laws that

(13:50) are just and fair to you yeah why like you could have because you could go to prison that's a huge state let me show I'll show you right can kings put you in

(13:57) prison can kings also pass just laws

(14:02) sometimes maybe okay so if kings pass just laws why do you need to vote well why did we fight no answer the question

(14:08) before you ask another one i just answered all of yours if a king passes just laws why would you need to vote

(14:14) because a king can also pass unjust laws so can legislators sure but if you have a stake in that and if you're able to

(14:19) represent for your legislator you can vote a legislator out yeah but you can also rebel against kings so like that's

(14:25) why I'm saying your position doesn't follow it doesn't actually follow for you to say that because you can be

(14:31) imprisoned inside of a nation that that somehow gives you the right to vote well because you have a stake you're saying that Hang on i'm falsifying your claim

(14:39) i'm falsifying your claim if you claim kings make just can make just laws right

(14:45) yes then I don't understand why would people need to vote when kings are making just laws well then why would we leave the monarchy of England if kings

(14:52) can make just laws why would we leave well in that case they had you had a nation apart that had a rebellion

(14:59) against the king that's what was going on but kings have been rebelled against historically under certain circumstances

(15:04) many times so you'd like to go back to feudalism like you don't believe in democracy well yeah that is it feudalism

(15:10) is under a monarch it would be called limited democracy which is exactly what we had here do you think we had

(15:16) feudalism because most people couldn't vote here we had limited democracy and then there were like several many

(15:21) uprisings against that limited democracy because everyone deserves uprisings really against that the only uprising

(15:27) that I'm aware of in American history against America was the civil war the civil war the civil rights

(15:34) movement voting the civil rights movement no no no the civil war wasn't

(15:40) about voting well I mean it was about the owning of cattle slaves so not about voting then which is also about human

(15:47) and civil rights but not about voting though but voting is a civil right i don't know i'm not sure that I believe

(15:53) in this it's about freedom and it's about representation the point is representation so let's back up that's what voting is voting is representation

(15:59) and democra i understand but you haven't actually made the positive case for why people need to be able to vote people

() 

(16:04) need to be able to vote because they have a stake in the legislation of this country if you can be imprisoned at this country if you can be robbed of your

(16:12) bodily autonomy by the legislators of this country then you should be able to have a stake in the laws that those

(16:18) legislators are making well let's see if this makes sense do you agree with me that individually individual vote v

(16:23) voters don't actually have very much power at all individual voters no but that's the point of a collective vote

(16:29) yeah I'm with you so individuals already don't really have very much power just because they can vote right sure so

(16:35) isn't it the case actually that what you're advocating for is political tribalism because you don't have

(16:40) individual power as a voter you actually have to tribalize with other voters in order to have any sort of collective

(16:46) power right well you're taking away power from all the voters so to answer my question please tribalism the idea

(16:54) that you as the individual do not have power right you do have to collectivize

(17:00) with other people right okay but how is the answer yes or no no yeah okay no but

(17:07) here's my question how is taking away more people's votes disincentivizing political tribal because now I have to

(17:13) band with someone Because now I have to band with someone who has a vote i don't even get a stake so you're saying

(17:19) because people don't have enough power to vote i'm going to take what little power they do have you're not answering

(17:24) my question though it just doesn't make sense structure i know but you got to answer my question it just doesn't sound like you believe in It sounds like you

(17:30) need to answer my question though it sounds like your question is meant to trap me because can you just answer the

(17:36) question please what's what's facious about my argument you're saying that people do not have a stake in this

(17:41) country therefore they do not have a right to vote it's not what I said what you're doing is a straw man fallacy can we go back to you can go back what I

(17:48) said to you specifically is is what you're saying doesn't logically follow and when I'm talking about political tribalism do you agree with me that you

(17:56) do if you need to have collectives to have actual political power are you not

(18:01) promoting political tribalism if you need to have colle but that's how voting works it's about a majority so then you

(18:07) are promoting collective political tribalism right so voting and then the

(18:13) will of the majority is essentially political tribalism is what you're saying well it's not really the will of the majority here's what happens no not

(18:20) really do you understand how voting works do you okay well then tell me how it's the will of the majority when a

(18:26) California legislature gets elected well everyone who would like to vote can vote

(18:31) and then whoever the most what about the people in Georgia wins well why would a person in Georgia get to vote on So it's

(18:37) not really the collective it's the tribe right but then Georgians get to vote for their So it's a tribe then and then all

(18:44) of those legislators come together so it's a tribe so it's a tribe it's not a tri but those are called states yeah and

(18:51) states are voting for their own interests right but states will vote for the governors why would I get to vote

(18:57) for the govern listen to me why would I get to vote for the governor of let's say

(19:02) Tennessee if I don't live in Tennessee makes sense okay so it's almost like it's almost like these individual states

(19:09) right they vote along tribal lines for that state's particular interest right yes and each state has a representative

(19:16) collective government sure in the federal government right you're talking about in our Senate and in our Congress

(19:22) right great so let's start with this if it is the case that you have California

(19:27) and Nevada these are two states which are next to each other you agree right yes can these states vote against each other's interests when it comes to

(19:33) resources in the federal government yes no even at the state level they can right why would

(19:39) they be able to at the state level i can't vote for the Nevada governor i can't vote for because perhaps there's

(19:44) something that perhaps Nevada perhaps Nevada has some type of I don't know assessed tax or something like this uh

(19:51) that they're able to collect which disproportionately affects Californians in some way they can do that right what

(19:58) law is that whatever it would be they can does it exist or does it not exist can they do that can they do that is my

(20:06) question can Nevada legislate against California no they're not legislating against Listen to my question actually I

() 

(20:12) want you to repeat my question so I know you actually heard it i'm sorry i'm not a dog i don't Can you Can you repeat it well it's called steel maning a position

(20:18) say the question okay can states vote against other states interests simply by

(20:24) having a neighboring state right let's just say for instance that you were to have like oh I don't know trucks which

(20:30) went between Nevada and California right and California took advantage of this by

(20:36) raising uh taxes on gasoline but only on the border areas where these goods came in this disproportionately hurts Nevada

(20:43) truckers for some reason right they can do that right yes they can do that okay great so in California if that was

(20:50) beneficial to Californians they would basically be voting for their tribe against Nevada right but is that

(20:55) happening or just trying to use a hypothetical no there's tons and tons of instances where different states do various things even asking for federal

(21:01) money in overages compared to other states for different problems same thing with disaster support they definitely

(21:07) are all trying to support their tribe right okay so because states can potentially hypothetically vote against

(21:14) another state's interest men and women should not have the right to No that's not the conclusion but that's that was

(21:19) your argument privilege is again do you know what a descriptor is sexes one marriage voting system why don't you

(21:26) understand the difference between a descriptor and prescriptor what did I prescribe what you prescribed is one

(21:31) voting system is a voting system in which both men and women are disin what I'm doing right now is I'm giving you

(21:36) descriptors so we can determine if it's tribalism or not because you said it's not tribalism to have collectivism and

(21:42) voting blocks which is insane but what you haven't been able to answer is why disenfranchising more voters is somehow

(21:49) solving political tribalism let let her get to the end of the sentence please well let me explain it the best way that

(21:54) I possibly can your worldview promotes political tribalism so what happens is

(22:00) this nos's can go to our government and they can bribe them for voting blocks and that's exactly what they do

(22:06) non-government organizations do this and lobbyists do this and what they do is they raid the treasury from people like

(22:12) you and me so that they can bribe certain portions of the electorate in order to incentivize them to collectivize that's why black people

(22:18) often vote as a monolith for instance they vote monolithically up to 80 90% together especially in national hang on

(22:25) especially in national elections because they're promised made certain promises out of the treasury from the electorate

(22:33) usually at the expense of other forms of of uh of voters this is 100% tribalism

(22:39) so how are NOS's bribing politicians influencing who black people as

(22:44) individuals choose to vote for how do NOS's do that i just don't understand how you're

(22:50) saying I mean I agree that NOS's should not be bribing and lobbyists shouldn't be bribing but instead of I mean that's

(22:56) what they do though right okay but we're trying to get back to your claim that people should vote okay well I'm

(23:02) responding because this is a conversation sure so we're trying to get back to your claim that less people from

(23:08) both sexes should be able to vote yeah no that's not where we just were where

(23:13) were we just That's your initial yeah but now you're just pivoting where we just were was Well you're not letting me finish my sentence you let me finish my

(23:19) sentence you're pivoting we're talking right now about whether tribalism is descriptively true in your voting system

() 

(23:25) i understand that but we're trying to get back to your initial claim because you have a very important claim to defend you're trying to take this away

(23:32) from the American people poorly but let's get into it um so NOS's bribe

(23:38) lobbyists bribe and that is impacting who and what politicians are promoting i

(23:43) would agree with that statement would you agree with that statement uh well not just what they're promoting but uh

(23:48) also they are setting the precedent for laws themselves okay yes so they actually I would I would even argue back

(23:55) that NOS's and private think groups write the laws in which politicians most often execute and so do bankers as well

(24:03) i agree with that so why would taking away votes from the average American and

(24:09) singular citizen prevent NOS's and lobbyists from having an ability to impact and predict and create laws yeah

(24:17) so if you're to if you move to stakeholder democracy this idea that you had to have some sort of public service

(24:22) or something like this it actually collectivizes down the voting pool which adds responsibility to the voters who

(24:29) can then be held accountable which right now voters can't be that's why that's why it's so important so you're not

(24:35) saying can be held accountable so you're saying how well legislators will create laws that hold those voters accountable

(24:42) the ones who have to follow them do you not have Well that's not you're being held accountable so it is being held accountable no no so right now under

(24:47) tribalism you can get laws passed which affect me but benefit you i can't go

(24:55) like hold you somehow accountable for that but that's how a majority voting work that's how I know which is why I

() 

(25:01) want limited democracy where we can actually hold people accountable want to be in charge how would I be in charge if

(25:07) it's stakeholder democracy well you said one marriage voting system that could be one way of doing it yes okay what are

(25:13) the other ways of doing it another good way would be public service so whoever public service perhaps up to 3 to 5

(25:19) years unpaid or military service would be good so during this public service in which people are go working 3 to 5 years

(25:26) unpaid how are they paying for food and groceries and housing yeah so the state would take care of that just like they

(25:31) do in military the state would take care of that like they do in the military and how do you plan on getting that passed

(25:38) what does that have to do with anything well because let's say I could never get it passed we're arguing the ideology of

(25:43) this system what does that have to do with anything what's the point in creating an ideology that will never work out how you going to get Marxism

(25:49) passed you're not so are you aren't you a Marxist part but you're a Marxist right how did you know that well I don't

(25:55) know that's what your videos seem to imply that you believe in Marxist feminism and Marxist oh I don't know are you a socialist on a certain level so

(26:03) okay how you going to get socialist like that's silly that us making the comparison contrast between like socialism capitalism has no bearing on

(26:10) whether or not I could somehow get this passed or have some plan to get it passed okay i'm arguing about the

(26:15) ideology here do you want to understand my belief or do you just want to guess well hang on what does I have to do you

(26:20) know what I just said though well I mean you just called me a Marxist call me a socialist well if you're not a Marxist I said we're doing a comparison contrast

(26:26) of worldviews and ideology for doing contrast worldview and ideology it's a nonsequator to ask me well how you going

(26:32) to get it passed what does that have to do with anything well why would you create a worldview that fundamentally cannot work in practice that sounds like

(26:38) it's not a worldview that fundamentally cannot work in practice even if I couldract even if I couldn't

(26:44) prescriptively tell you like the next political chain of things we do to get there has nothing to do with whether or

(26:49) not the worldview in practice would work i do you have any practical guesses for how we could apply this to a modern day

(26:55) society well I just Yeah yeah i just told you how we would apply it you would have stakeholder democracy okay so

(27:02) that's just so one day we're just going to flip a switch and have that like I don't understand no what do you mean okay you could have an amendment for it

(27:08) you could repeal the 19th amendment you could So you want to repeal the right to vote or just replace it it wouldn't be

(27:14) what I'm talking about is universal suffrage you keep on making a conflation in terms you think that uh because I say

(27:20) universal suffrage that means no suffrage i'm talking about limited suffrage so who gets to decide who gets

(27:26) the right to vote didn't I literally just tell you who gets to decide who or who gets to vote okay so everyone who

(27:33) participates in this public service gets the right that could be one way to do it

(27:39) yes okay um and that anyone could do that if you wanted to yeah people could

(27:45) do it if they're willing to give up x amount of years of their lives on for unpaid service so that they could then vote but it's not unpaid service because

(27:52) the government would be paying for their food and their housing yeah but you wouldn't be getting anything additional to that okay well why not just have

(27:57) civil servants who are already because civil servants have specific jobs to do like you know working at the DMV and

(28:04) stuff like that and working in the social security office so you're basically saying anyone who does community service should get the right

(28:10) to vote now some sort of civil occupational service under the state that could be like civil firefighting work maybe uh it could be civil

(28:17) paramedic work it could be all there's all sorts of different things you can look at for uh stakeholder democracy

(28:22) when we've seen it applied around the world it's been somewhat successful and do the laws apply to everyone in the

(28:27) society or just the people who still apply to everyone yeah okay so how can

() 

(28:33) you create and apply a law to people who are not represented i just don't

(28:38) understand morally how do you justify there's nothing immoral about it there's nothing immoral about i mean but that's

(28:44) kind of like I would say it's more immoral why is it moral for an 18-year-old to nullify the vote of a 41-year-old if the 18-year-old doesn't

(28:50) even know what they're voting for how's that moral well because the 18-year-old is still subject to the laws of the

(28:56) state yeah but they don't even know what they're voting for can an 18-year-old go to jail for 20 years a 16-year-old can

(29:02) should they be able to vote 16-year-olds can't go to jail yes they can 16-year-olds can go to jail for life should they be able to vote i mean no

(29:09) but why would why not the laws apply to them though why would a 16-year-old be going hang on i don't Because he murdered someone okay that's fair i mean

(29:15) if you murder someone that's a whole So I don't understand why can't he vote the laws apply to him why can't he vote yeah

(29:21) but we all understand that we all understand it's not an argument why does a 16-year-old get to vote even though

(29:26) all the lies laws apply to the 16-year-old why does he get to vote not all the laws apply they start in

(29:32) juvenile detention and then at 18 they get the right so laws apply to 16 but you're retrieded at 18 so laws apply to

(29:39) 16y olds some laws of course yes okay great why can't they vote then so babies should get the right to vote that's my

(29:45) question to you that makes no sense exactly so why do we limit it to 18 well that's the age that we've defined as

(29:50) being a legal adult that's the age that we as a country have universally agreed with our right to vote is Yeah but what

(29:55) makes that a good idea just because you arbitrarily Yeah just because you arbitrarily say

(30:01) for instance that uh because you're 18 and you're an adult like you can't buy cigarettes you can't buy beer you can't

(30:09) rent a car but you're an adult and now you can vote in the participation of democracy at least raise it so you'd

(30:16) like to raise it at least raise it so you would like to universally a raise the age to vote i think that would be a

(30:22) better idea than like not No no no what I said is at least do that but the thing

(30:27) is like you're actually inconsistent here you your whole argument is to say

(30:32) if laws affect people they should have a right to vote but we have an entire cast of people from the age 17 down who laws

(30:38) apply to and can't vote and you just are like you shug that off like you didn't contradict yourself i'm pretty sure it

(30:44) has something to do with brain development but we've all like you have to have not fully developed till what 25 according to you have a society in which

(30:50) you don't have an age that someone becomes a leader i agree but why couldn't you have a society in which you had stakeholder democracy it would be

(30:58) the same logic so if you're saying that we should not disenfranchise children why would you then disenfranchise people

(31:04) who are legal adults what do you When did I ever make the claim that I wanted children to be able to vote you just

(31:09) said that if everyone should have No I told you that your view is inconsistent if it is the case propositionally you

(31:16) say Andrew if laws apply to people they should be able to vote except oh I don't know everybody's 17 and under that's

(31:23) inconsistent hang on hang on apply to children it's inconsistent and a contradiction but laws do apply to

(31:28) children what about the laws that don't what about the laws that don't what about the laws where you're 17 years old

(31:33) and you could be tried as an adult well those are to protect like public freedom i mean but everyone loses civil

(31:39) liberties when they are a danger to the public yeah but do you do you understand that you're you're making a

(31:44) contradiction when you say if laws should apply to all all people should

(31:49) should have a right to vote because they have to they have laws which can be applied they can be sent to prison was your example that would have to include

(31:56) everyone under the age of 18 but people under the age of 18 don't go to adult prison yes they do all the time yes they

(32:02) do that is that is you want me to give you sources of 16 17 year olds tries

(32:07) adults and sent to adult prisons okay but it that's like an exception for exclusively horrific crimes i mean those

(32:14) are violent offenders does the law apply to them or not to violent offenders if you are a threat to public safety yes

(32:20) everyone who if the law applies to them and they can be sent to jail then by your logic they should be able to vote

(32:26) which means you're in contradiction to those offenders they are sent to juvenile detention centers until they

(32:31) turn 18 and then they are sent to an adult prison they are still sent often to adult centers even at 17 to adult

(32:39) prisons you can be sentenced as an adult but you can't be sent to an adult prison at the age of 16 this would depend

(32:45) widely on the state that you're in it's not rigorously enforced across the board like you think there's not like I don't

(32:51) think there's federal laws which say this but even if it were the case I'll just grant it i'll even grant the entire

(32:58) thing it still wouldn't matter laws apply to them they can still be sent to prison they fit both of your criteria

(33:04) therefore if you say they shouldn't be able to vote your worldview's in contradiction well then I think that's wrong i don't believe that children

(33:10) should be tried as adults until they have become adults so no laws apply to children no well then why shouldn't they

(33:16) be able to vote a threat to public safety is always applies to everyone threats to public safety always apply to

(33:22) everyone yeah but why shouldn't they be able to vote if laws apply to them that's your example laws apply to children but they are not in practice

(33:28) punished in the same way that they apply to adults it's applied to Can they be punished of course they can then why

(33:33) can't they vote but you have to have some way to maintain societal control children aren't just allowed to do whatever the [ __ ] they want because

(33:38) they're right you need to be able to have some sort of societal control so this would mean necessarily

(33:45) disenfranchising some people wouldn't it it would mean necessarily disenfranchising children yes they're not No it would also mean

(33:51) disenfranchising prisoners do you want prisoners to vote on their right to own guns in a prison not their right to own

(33:56) guns in a prison well then you're disenfranchising think that people who were in prison and then leave prison should then have to vote but they're

(34:03) disenfranchised currently under the law right no they're not yes they are if you're a felon you can't vote yes oh

(34:09) well once they leave yes I do think that that's disenfranchisement and I think Florida just rolled that back but what's

(34:14) wrong with disenfranchising like murderers for life what's wrong with disenfranch well they would be in jail

(34:20) for life if they No no no they're out of jail they're just felons so they can't vote well they Yeah I think that felons

(34:26) should be able to vote once they be able to own guns no cuz it's Oh well I don't understand so you're dis again you are

(34:33) so inconsistent with your disenfranchising do you understand what disenfranchisement should exist so long

(34:40) as someone is a threat to public safety the reason why prisoners are not allowed to vote who are currently in prison is

(34:46) because they are a threat to public safety 16-year-olds aren't a threat to public safety no but they're children

() 

(34:51) you can't allow anyone you can arbitrarily disenfranchise people based on the fact that you think they're not

(34:57) capable of making good voting decisions right no a child is legally different than an adult because they can't make

(35:04) you can't have sex with a child that would be because they can't make good decisions no because they're legally classified as a child do you not

(35:09) understand what because they can't make good decisions because they're two and three and four they're not legally involved so they can't make good

(35:16) decisions no they can make good decisions but generally speaking you can't have children vote there is a with

(35:22) you you can't but why why is it then that if I were to say that I only want 25y olds to vote I would be

(35:28) disenfranchising you say you only want 25 year olds to vote you say you only want one marriage voting system per

(35:34) household you you want less of both adult men and adult but do you understand how my view is consistent but

(35:40) yours isn't because if we if you were to agree with me that you wanted like okay Andrew I would compromise a 25-year-old

(35:46) voting you've now disenfranchised everyone from the ages of 18 through 24 a legal adult you should be able to vote

(35:53) that's my state if you are considered a legal adult if you are tried as an adult

(35:58) if you are allowed to buy a house have a child but that leads to the problem is

(36:04) is that that leads to political tribalism so like for instance why is it a healthy society to have uh men and

(36:10) women who are married voting against each other that's a terrible idea because they're both like but if a man

(36:16) commits a murder is his wife does his wife go to jail for that crime no no cuz they're not the same [ __ ] person what

(36:22) does that have to do with anything if they're different people and they're both tried differently and they both have separate lives and separate bank

(36:28) accounts and separate bodily and physical autonomy then they should each get a stake in this government no well I

(36:35) that literally has nothing to do with what I just asked they're not the same so why should they be representing you

(36:40) remember how I said yes and no to your question can you do that for me remember how I was like yes and just answered it

(36:46) can you actually do that for me too i don't remember that at all you literally just asked me that question you said if a husband's carded off to prison does

(36:52) her wife go to prison i said no okay can you do that for me too and then give your explanation because otherwise I

(36:57) don't know your actual position thing and then gave the explanation so now I'd like to know do you think it's a good

() 

(37:02) idea for wives and husbands to uh be able to vote against each other's interests they should both have a vote

(37:08) yes well that's but they can vote against each other's interests right that is circumstantial they may not they

(37:15) might yeah they may not they might i agree with that but why is it good that that option is even there it seems like

(37:21) a terrible idea because in a representative democracy everyone should be represented with a vote yeah I get that's a descriptive truth but you're

(37:27) not telling me why that should be the case if I were to give you the counter claim here I would say if you had like

(37:32) one household voting or something like this it would be much more uniform and wouldn't divide families against each

(37:38) other and that's exactly what the vote has done but they're both subject to the same legislative like they can both be

(37:44) legislated independent of each other right no well not really one cannot at that point make a decision that doesn't

(37:50) affect the other one usually yes I can not really what I mean Roie Wade that

(37:55) only affects a woman's body right no you think that if a man is married to a woman and she goes and aborts his baby

(38:02) that doesn't affect him of course it does but it affects him differently than his body but it's still But that's my whole point is is that everything they

(38:08) do in this household is going to affect each other sure so you wouldn't want to promote systems which divide husbands

(38:14) against wives but they're individuals no are they the same person or not this is

(38:20) not what's in dispute are they the same person or not okay no then why should they not each have an individual liberty

(38:26) what if they get because you don't want to set up systems that divide them against each other that's a bad idea marry someone who doesn't want to vote

(38:33) for with you but that's no do you understand that like people's preferences change over time and there

(38:38) could be various reasons in which uh if you have a tribal uh type of mentality

(38:44) like take abortion for instance abortion is a great one uh do you think that it's possible that women for instance could

() 

(38:50) hold it against their husband and say things like "Do this or I'll abort your child." They could actually do that

(38:57) right yeah hypothetically sure yeah and have done that that would be immoral and have done that that would be immoral

(39:02) yeah but but but you wouldn't say they couldn't go get the abortion would you well would you say a man can't but hang on hang on answer the question first

(39:08) what you wouldn't say that they shouldn't be allowed to do that though would you well if it would be disenfranchising millions of other women

(39:15) who aren't need Yes or no please you wouldn't say that you you would not

(39:21) actually say that they should not be allowed to get the abortion right no I think everyone should have access to

(39:26) Okay so even if it were the case that a woman right was holding uh the man

(39:32) basically emotionally hostage with her pregnancy and said "Do what I say or I'll get an abortion." Right you would

(39:38) not make any claim that she could or could not get that abortion would you i would make a claim that what she's doing

(39:43) is immoral but I wouldn't make a claim that because should anything happen to a woman who does that yeah I think I mean

(39:50) that's blackmailing and it's not blackmail i think on a level it's emotional blackmail i think you should be able to What should happen should

(39:56) they go to jail i mean maybe pay damages or a fine a fine how much should the

(40:01) fine be i don't know 200 bucks how much is an abortion to They' be the same as

(40:06) an abortion can I ask you a question so So just to get this right well I want to finish this real quick and then we can

(40:11) move back well no you can't till I finish the inquiry i'm not going to answer your question but but you can inquire back i just want to finish this

(40:17) inquiry the line of inquiry that's all so just to make sure I got this right you have now said that the tribal voting

(40:26) does indeed uh pit husband against wife has a potential to do so right and I've

(40:31) even conceded to specific examples of where it would be in a woman's interest to vote against her husband to have a right to do something which could be

(40:38) used against him later and then said well the punishment should be like oh maybe she pays a fine if something like

(40:43) that happens and you how are you going to convince people that that's a better system than one household voting that's

(40:49) a terrible system because then the leader of that household or the head of that household has control over the

(40:54) right and the will of every single person in that household you're fundamentally denying people free will they're not allowed to yes they are

(41:00) because if they're fundamental denying them of free will huh because if they're both legislated by the same government

(41:06) and one of them has no say in who is elected into that government but still

() 

(41:11) because you're still free by law but you're still impacted by laws so what you're being impacted by laws when

(41:16) you're 17 they can't vote you have a consistency issue same extent as an 18-year-old not at the same extent they

(41:22) can have it to the same extent as an 18-year-old in very rare exceptions but you're But they can then so you're

(41:28) disenfranchising people but look at you you're around the fringe you're fighting on an exception we're talking about the general population even in the general

(41:34) population talking about murderers i'm not talking about school shootings i don't think it's generally speaking good idea to let

(41:40) 18year-olds 19year-olds 20-year-olds to vote to disenfranchise the votes of people who are politically informed

(41:45) because they're being used as a leverage voting block for elitists and that's

(41:50) what's actually happening what's actually happening was what you just said you know NOS's and lobbyists are

(41:56) lobbying Congress to get various things passed and what they do is they try to

(42:02) leverage the votes uh from a tribalist uh purview in order to get the things

(42:07) that they want right and 18 19 20 21 year olds are highly impressionable

(42:12) right so we're 22 23 24 25 year olds highly impressionable and one way that you could eliminate this idea that they

(42:19) could be gone after by the parasitic nos who run things is by simply liming limiting the ability to vote to people

(42:26) who have such a political interest that they actually do social service for up to 5 years so that then we can trust

(42:33) them with the right to vote okay i have two statements can you let me get through them sure okay so here's number

(42:39) one um I agree that lobbying generally is bad i'm not here for NOS's i don't think

(42:45) anyone really is i mean the whole point of why we don't like them is because we want to be represented by our

(42:50) legislators fairly and accurately and we don't want it to be the in the control

(42:56) of a private interest group so lobbying is bad yes generally I think that lobbyists and NOS's are not good but

(43:02) what I don't understand is if that's the issue why not ban NGOs why not have a

(43:09) platform that's standing against NOS's and lobbyist i think that'd be something great if you did that that'd be awesome yeah so this is a great question but

(43:15) here's the problem right this is the leverage of tribalism and why you can't really do that so on social issue on

() 

(43:22) social issues right there are nos out there for instance who have a vested

(43:27) interest in abortions being legal right this goes out into the social ethos and

(43:32) now we're battling over the social issue we have become tribal right we become tribal

(43:38) then you have nos who battle against it let's say this social issue they also are making a ton of money off of the

(43:44) counter battle let's say also utilizing political tribalism the whole idea here

(43:50) is divisive tribalism is what enables NOS's to begin with they make a ton of money off of it especially off of race

(43:56) hustling and DEI so then again why not just ban NOS's and lobbyists and allow

(44:01) everyone to still have a vote in a representative i'm giving you the descriptor i think it's hilarious that you keep calling democracy tribalism

(44:08) it it leads it leads to tribalism yeah yeah but I mean full democracy leads to tribalism there's no way around it yeah

(44:16) exactly yeah so does sports sure should we ban sports no why would you ban

(44:21) sports that has that's totally nonsequiter it makes no sense why would you ban a huge percentage of the

(44:28) population from voting because I would want to avoid political tribalism so that elitist can't exploit

(44:34) lowinformation voters which they do right now in order to enslave the planet

(44:39) so you're basically saying that people are too stupid to have the right to vote yes that's dumb dude don't you agree

(44:45) with that yeah of course I think people are stupid well then what are you arguing with me about if I want a right

(44:51) to vote then I should give them the right to vote why but that's But listen think about what you just said yeah dude

(44:56) i agree that people are too stupid to vote but give them the right to vote anyway i don't think people are too stupid to vote so they're too stupid to

() 

(45:03) function but they're smart come on you think that people who go and generally

(45:08) cast a ballot are high information voters or they barely even know what the hell they're talking about i mean do you

(45:15) have a statistic on how many of them are you could do street polls a lot of people have no idea what's even going on with the issues a lot of people are just

(45:21) bust to poll booths they get bribed to do it this happens on both sides of the aisle like how many times have you seen

(45:28) canvasing campaigns who go out there and they're canvasing they knock on doors that people don't even know what the hell they're talking about so what you

(45:34) think we should do an IQ test for everyone to have their That's been suggested right but I have a better plan

(45:40) than an IQ test i would not disenfranchise a person from being able to vote because they have like an

(45:45) average IQ what I would do is disenfranchise a person to vote if they were low information one way I could find out if

(45:51) they were really politically motivated is if they sacrificed years of their lives to the state in order to get that

(45:57) right to vote so you want to punish people for being stupid uh no i just don't want them to nullify well-informed

(46:04) votes from people who are smart and on the issues and understand the issues but taking away someone's vote would be

(46:10) punishing them in a sense it's not punishing them it's actually stopping them from punishing themselves and the

(46:15) rest of society because they're easily exploited by social elites that's fair i

(46:20) mean but why not then just target education like why not then we spend 5% of the entire GDP of the United States

(46:28) on education it's the highest anywhere in the world and we have some of the dumbest people on planet Earth our

(46:34) literacy rate is barely you know what the literacy rate is yeah it's garbage it's trash and we spend 5% the biggest

(46:41) GDP on planet earth we spend five total% of our GDP on education and you think

(46:47) that education's going to solve the problem of the low information the issue is that people are stupid help them be

(46:52) smarter there's a lot of that is is a mixture of genes and environment and nourishment and all sorts of different

(46:59) things it's like you can't this whole progressive idea environment and nourishment then why not this whole

(47:05) stupid progressive idea of like you just can just educate people into whatever it

(47:11) is that it's like no you really can't like there's a lot of people who are just going to be [ __ ] janitors okay

(47:17) there's a lot of Yeah okay there's a lot of people who are just going to be [ __ ] janitors and who are just going

(47:25) to be [ __ ] toilet bowl cleaners and who are just going to be [ __ ] bartenders and are really not meant to

(47:31) build [ __ ] rocket ships okay no but they're still subject to laws against frustrating but it's just a fact

(47:38) if I want free will and they want and you want free will and we deserve the right to vote then they do no you're not

(47:44) eliminating free will by this you're protecting the rest of society from low information information voters

(47:50) destroying their lives like do you really think Let me ask you someone else's free will let me ask you this if

(47:56) you were to Yeah but you're not really doing that what you're doing a vote is an exercise in free will let me ask you

(48:02) this if you had to choose right for your family sure and you knew that you could move them to a place where there was a

(48:09) bunch of people who were highly informed on political processes in the local community or you can move them to a

(48:14) place where people didn't give a [ __ ] right which place would you prefer them to be i would prefer them to be in the

(48:20) higher of course right at the place where the people are the most informed speaking of which my mother's claiming here screener sorry Mom love you now if

(48:27) if you were able to if these people were able to cast votes and nullify all of the votes of you highinformation voters

(48:34) right wouldn't it actually be better for them and for you to disenfranchise their voting so that you guys could actually

(48:42) vote on political and policy issues that made sense well I don't think that stupid people are nullifying all of the

(48:48) votes of smart people really

(48:53) think about what you just said can you think about think about what you just do you think there's more stupid people or

(48:58) smart people in this country yeah that's probably more okay so you really don't think stupid people are nullifying the

(49:04) votes of smart people on a certain level yeah because at the same time they still deserve free will i can't really They

(49:10) still have free will they don't because they are still subject to law voting is a privilege if you go to Australia and

(49:18) you commit a crime can you go to jail in Australia but you can't vote in Australia right

(49:23) sure so you see how that makes no sense like what you're saying makes no sense you travel to another country and endanger people like that's a threat

(49:30) you're not even endangering people if you're just like drunk in public you can be arrested that is a threat to public safety public intoxication is a threat

(49:37) to public that doesn't mean you're going to actually do anything wrong right but you could yeah or or I mean drunken

(49:42) people are habitually statistically more violent or you could break some public ordinance right you could break some

(49:48) public ordinance you didn't know about like you're on a beach right and you're in your shorts and it was supposed to be t-shirts and shorts you know something

(49:54) like this yeah but breaking public ordinances doesn't lead to jail time it does if you don't pay the fine well then you should pay the [ __ ] fine you see

(50:01) what I mean though so you are subject to those laws and you are subject to imprisonment based on those laws and if that's the case you can't vote in those

(50:07) countries okay but you're not a citizen of that country you're still a citizen of this country if you are a citizen you

(50:13) live here and you are subject to the laws of this country for your entire life from birth to death you should have

(50:18) Why do you want Why do you want dumb people to disenfranchise your well-informed vote that makes no sense

(50:24) not only that you say that you're actually emboldening them with their free will right it's like that's so

(50:30) silly because ultimately these people who are politically low information they're so low information you're

(50:35) allowing them to get taken advantage of of course I don't want dumb people to disenfranchise my vote but I don't think that the solution to that is a one

(50:42) marriage voting system or a you have to do public service for 5 years to have a give me an alternative but can't dumb

(50:47) people do that too like couldn't a dumb person just do some [ __ ] community service for 5 years and then get paid i

(50:53) mean like there are dumb people in the army listen I agree with you that there can be some stupid people who get

(50:58) through the system but they're not going to be probably low information you're not going to go through 5 years of civil

(51:03) service like that for the purpose of being able to vote and be low information or you wouldn't do it you

(51:09) have an interest that's what the whole point is well I mean if your housing and your food is paid for I think there are

(51:14) a lot of people who'd be interested in that the army i mean that's like exactly in the army you have to take the the

(51:20) army you have to take an ASBA test and you have to score X amount of a score in order to even be placed in those things

(51:26) big dog my boyfriend's a vet he talks about some dumb [ __ ] in the army sure there's dumb people in the army but so they would but to qualify

(51:33) for certain jobs you can't be and for civil service or something like this you can do intelligence tests or things like that so you're basically saying there

(51:39) should be an IQ test and only those who would like to be civil servants who pass that IQ test well I think you should

(51:44) probably implement an IQ test for the military too which they do yeah but people suck at I mean but they do but

(51:52) they do unless it's in wartime and they're like "Okay well uh we just you just need a body in here and then

(51:57) they'll grab anybody off the street." But yeah can we ask right now i want to confirm that of course aiden

(52:04) do you do IQ tests for the military yeah i like Wait do you is you want boyfriend

(52:11) reveal oh sure wait oh go the go it's okay just go around that way they aren't playing yeah there are people who are

(52:17) there who are dumb that's true but they Here baby come here come here first if you can just kind of like I've heard of

() 

(52:23) that it's called a cat five waiver right they give them a cap five waiver talking about category five waiverss i'm talking about Can you just baby come here shalom

(52:30) not shalom um in terms of like people in the army and IQ test like I've taken the

(52:36) ASVAB it is not a very difficult test and a lot of people get their ASVABS taken for them i knew guys in the army

(52:42) who were like medically diagnosible with metal deficiencies and were still in the army doing jobs that in theory required

(52:49) a certain level of mental faculty sure yeah the system can get gamed but those are exceptions not the rule

(52:56) i wouldn't really go that far to be honest with you and then also in terms of your you don't think the majority of

(53:01) people are stupid or in the army are stupid do you i think that there are a great number of people who join the army

(53:06) because they want a place to live and food which is the system you just described and that that's pretty much independent of intelligence they seem to

(53:13) be joining the army based around patriotism the ability to get paid the ability to do things like that what's

(53:18) that when were you in the army i was in the army for a very limited amount of time years and years ago how long was

(53:24) that very limited amount of time if you don't let me ask um it was it wasn't very about a year about a year so what happened well it doesn't it doesn't

(53:30) matter what happened oh but we're talking about service man what about it so you want to uh disenfranchise people

(53:36) based on military service i actually know why most What are you talking about how would I disenfranchise them based on

(53:42) military service it would be the opposite you're requiring people to serve no it wouldn't require them to

(53:47) serve in the army literally didn't say that i'm sorry about that yeah I literally didn't say that thank you for

(53:53) your help i thank you justice so now we've established that people in the

(53:58) army can very much be stupid so nobody ever disputed you can have stupid people in the army okay so again we're trying

(54:05) to go back we're trying to figure out how system would work in terms of those

(54:11) who are participating in some sort of civil service yeah so you would have some type of civil service right which a

(54:17) person would participate in for at least 5 years five years yes unpaid yes unpaid

(54:23) that's ridiculous why do you think that the person who participated in it for 5

(54:28) years unpaid would really want to be politically informed by the end of that

(54:34) maybe maybe not that's five years of not having like that's 5 years of like housing is paid for service guarantees

(54:42) citizenship so can I ask who's paying for 5 years of millions of people participating in a civil Well chances

(54:49) would be pretty good but it wouldn't be millions or at least not hundreds of millions of people participating in such a system you would like to limit the

(54:56) voting block in this country to less than there's 430 million people in this country and you'd like to limit it to

(55:01) 330 million hundreds of millions it's 330 million in the United States i think 336 million or something regardless you

(55:08) would still like to limit it to I misspoke my bad but you would still like to limit it to less than You would like

() 

(55:13) to limit it to hundreds of thousands of people yeah you think it's fair for hundreds of thousands of speak people to

(55:18) speak on behalf of 360 million people do you think it's fair right now to have 100 senators do that no but we still

(55:25) vote for the senators for the senator do you really think you're getting They don't just walk up and say "Hello sir i would think you're really getting

(55:33) political representation inside of a state like New York with two people."

(55:40) I don't live in New York i know but inside the state of New York do you really think the state of New York is

(55:45) getting adequate political representation on Capitol Hill with two [ __ ] people well that's why you have

(55:50) the Senate and the House and the and the House two people who are your senator you really think every state gets two

(55:56) 100 people are representing 330 million people at the very top it's one person

(56:02) who's representing 330 million people so you advocating that we shouldn't have government no what I'm saying to you is

(56:07) that like it's very silly for me to look at an argument like you're making and say "Oh my god 100,000 people are going

(56:14) to be in charge or 200,000 people are going to be in charge." Like ultimately one person's in charge so you're saying ultimately one person's in charge do you

(56:20) But there's still checks and balances that one person isn't a king there still would be checks and balances with limited voting power in the There's

(56:26) still checks and balances with limited voting yeah but we still do not get to decide who is in our legislature as a

(56:32) voting body we do not get to decide who would vote you would still have people from within your various communities who

(56:37) would be voters and they would decide who it is that went to represent you on Capitol Hill that sounds very expensive

(56:44) and very pointless if I'm being honest how is that expensive okay fine because you have to pay for all their houses then if you want to do that there's

(56:49) another way you could do this too if you didn't want to do like the civil service way you could do one vote per household

(56:55) that would limit the that would limit the voting significantly hang on and it would be not expensive at all but

(57:02) there's even another way that you can do it on top of that all righty right but let's just start with like one household

(57:07) voting same thing go do it you can eliminate whatever this like perceived cost is that you have another thing you

(57:13) could do is just eliminate uh anybody being able to vote until they reach the same age that they could become

(57:19) president of the United States is that not 35 mhm so you think that everyone under 35 should lo the right to vote why

(57:25) shouldn't everyone under 35 be the most boomer [ __ ] I've ever seen why shouldn't everybody under 35 be able to be the

(57:30) president of the United States well because they don't have the But they're still Why answer the question because

(57:37) they do not yet have the experience in politics to run an entire country just because you can't Okay Andrew but just

(57:44) because you can't run an entire country doesn't mean that you should still not have the right to have one singular vote

(57:51) it's one vote what are you talking about yes you can't be the president but you are still susceptible to the laws you

(57:57) can have a kid at 35 you can have a house at 35 so what does that have to do with anything but you can't be president

(58:03) below president yeah legislatively below 35 from 18 to 34 all of these people are

(58:11) impacted at the same level no they're not all impacted at the same level in fact I would say can they all go to jail

(58:17) for committing a crime yes I would say the opposite i would say like people between the ages of 18 and like 25 are

(58:22) mostly living at home right and their parents are the ones who are mostly impacted by legislation not them and

(58:27) their parents issue and their parents should actually probably have more say than them their parents actually have more autonomy than they do because

(58:33) they're dependent on them right completely dependent upon them it's like if I look at the trends it seems to me

(58:39) like if you eliminated from 18 to 25 or from 25 to 35 if the founders didn't

(58:45) think you should be president of the United States till you were 35 I don't think they wanted you to vote either and

(58:51) you know what that's why it was never law voting rights are affirmed this is some old [ __ ] that's not an argument

(58:56) that's not an argument well I mean the reason why the argument is you're young you're old like you are not applicable

(59:03) to this law what did that have to do with anything you're trying to govern a group of people that you are not a member of so that's the issue so what

(59:09) everyone should be representative government so how old do you think the average person who's in Congress is hell

(59:14) old and they're representing all of you what do you mean i hate that so you you want you think that like 19-year-olds

(59:20) are going to be better governing than 60 year olds no but I think a I don't think an 80-year-old would be a representative

(59:26) government glad Mitch McConny are dying in their depends they're not governing what do you mean yes they are sleepy Joe

(59:34) sleepy Joe who who is in his 80s now has cancer and he's not president because he

(59:39) went off the deep end i know and Trump is in his 70s and Mitch McConnell is in his 80s all of these people are your

(59:44) presidents your presidents and congressmen are running like between the late 40s to 50s to 60s you don't really

(59:52) think that replacing them with 20-year-olds is a good idea do you i don't think we should replace them with 20-year-olds but first why not wait why

(59:59) not why not well they'd have to be elected first now yeah I know but but even if they were don't you think that

(1:00:04) would still probably not be the worst or the that wouldn't be a good idea if they were elected Uhhuh through a democratic

(1:00:10) representative democracy don't you think they would do a worse job though than 40 50 60 year olds would we don't know who

(1:00:16) it is you can't just say universally I think a 20-year-old would be worse if they are elected democratically why

(1:00:22) don't you think our founders thought that 35 year old years old was the minimum i think the founders law 35

(1:00:27) should be the minimum because you need experience in government to be the head of the government no experience in

(1:00:33) government is even required to become the president of the United States zero sure so why this age of 35 well because

(1:00:41) you have to have lived in this country for long enough to understand it on a basic level because because they also

(1:00:47) thought you just didn't have the requisite experience probably in life to govern at all that's fair to govern the entire country i would say to govern

(1:00:53) anybody no yeah really really i think so i mean why

(1:00:59) is it that they didn't let people vote why do you think they didn't want people to vote i mean dude they were kind of

(1:01:05) [ __ ] up i mean do you really want to base all of your beliefs on the founding fathers they own slaves like so so the

(1:01:11) whole world owns slaves just because a lot of people do something doesn't mean it's right yeah we were some of the first to take people out of slavery

(1:01:17) especially the West pretty sure that was England france did a second the West then that's That's the West england

(1:01:24) that's not America that's the West which is what I said the West the difference you said we were the first as an

(1:01:29) American the West is what I said i mean I don't think we're the same country as England sure we're like yeah but we're

(1:01:34) part of the West right like England we are not run by the same government as England fought a whole But we're part of

(1:01:40) the West and I said the West is the ones who uh you can't take credit for something another country did dog well

(1:01:48) first of all many of the people who came here came here from England right the

(1:01:53) idea of the repudiation of slavery came from those very same uh dogmas

(1:02:00) so like I don't know what you're talking about we're at 430 we're at four okay dude you've just spent the last hour trying to defend the belief that both

(1:02:07) that both sexes should be somehow disenfranchised from voting this whole one per household the one marriage

(1:02:12) system and I think fundamentally you have not been able to create an appeal to like closing statements here well

(1:02:19) because we're supposed to be debating feminism we never even got to it well well this would be a key a key component to this actually but I'm actually fine

(1:02:25) with this if you want to move it on to that like but here's the thing never made a single argument the argument is

(1:02:32) that people should be legislatively represented and allowed to vote in democracy that's just an assertion not

(1:02:38) an argument you just that's just like I think so the argument is if people are impacted by the laws that legislators

(1:02:45) create then they should have a say in who those legislators are yeah you whether it's a small city but that's a performative contradiction because you

(1:02:51) said that people who are affected by laws who a don't live here or b are younger than a certain threshold should

(1:02:58) be disenfranchised contradiction it's the point of democracy no it's that we should be represented by a

() 

(1:03:03) representative government i need to understand this logically that you're performing a contribution makes sense logically because it's a logical fallacy

(1:03:09) you are arguing a logical fallacy what's the fallacy the fallacy is that you're trying to essentially stop stupid people

(1:03:15) from voting by making That's not a logical fallacy well you didn't let me finish the sentence okay you're trying

(1:03:22) to stop stupid people from voting by making it so that less people can vote which is in turn taking away the power

(1:03:29) of the voter so what's the fallacy well you're trying to empower voters by taking away voters

(1:03:35) yeah how is that a logical fallacy you can't empower voters by taking away their power what are what how am I

(1:03:42) trying to empower voters what are you talking about point is that you're trying to combat tribalism and that you want smart people's votes and not have

(1:03:49) to do with empowering voters i thought that's why you're against NOS's lobbyists bribes you want to empower I

(1:03:56) don't know what you're talking about so you just don't want the I don't even know what you're talking about what I'm saying to you is that if you want to

(1:04:01) eliminate tribalism you don't want to have nothing but an unlimited amount of people voting where NOS's can mark to

(1:04:08) the stupid people and bend them to their will and now have that entire bracket for whatever it is their political

(1:04:14) agendas are so again why not just get rid of NOS's why is Oh my god NOS's are a problem make sure less people can vote

() 

(1:04:21) gee I never thought of that why don't we get rid of NOS's the people who are utilizing tribalism so that they exist

(1:04:27) boy I wish I had thought of that you're utilizing tribalism no they're utilizing tribalism so they exist okay but you're

(1:04:34) a political pundit you have the power to help people uhhuh why not promote a

(1:04:39) stance that is actually useful to them instead of trying to take away their vote great a stance that would be

(1:04:44) actually useful to them would be having their well-informed votes not nullified by nonwellinformed voters of what you

(1:04:50) believe and I believe are more than the well-informed voters that's exactly something I can do to help everybody but

(1:04:56) you're not helping everyone because stupid people still live here so what they still have a right to exist in a

(1:05:02) society who's taking away their right to exist in this society nobody yes you are

(1:05:07) because they if they are still held accountable to the same laws but now have no right or vote or say in who is

(1:05:16) enacting those laws and who is representing them in government like 17year-olds final statement from

(1:05:22) children on this if you final statement is like her position is a contradiction she says everybody should be able to

(1:05:29) vote inside of a a country where they are governed by the laws the problem is

(1:05:35) is that then she says all sorts of people who fall into the criteria of being supported by laws shouldn't be

(1:05:41) able to vote it's literally a performative contradiction then she moves to my view and agrees with my view

(1:05:47) that mostly that stupid people outnumber smart voters and and when you're talking

(1:05:52) about uh ill or uh ill-informed voters that NOS's often take advantage of them

(1:05:58) or I mean always take advantage of them she literally agrees with all of this but somehow still thinks it's a better

(1:06:03) idea to allow this to continue because Mafrey I don't know she never really

(1:06:08) gave an argument for that i don't really actually know why my turn yeah you can respond go ahead i mean I get that you

(1:06:15) don't understand why and I get that you don't understand my argument and I'm I'm sorry i hope one day you do but what I

(1:06:21) will say is generally yes it's annoying that stupid people are allowed to vote even though they sometimes make poor

(1:06:27) choices and fight against their own self-interest yes we don't like that yes we don't agree we do agree that

(1:06:33) lobbyists and NOS's have way too much power in setting precedents for laws

(1:06:39) those are both things that we mutually agree upon however I do not think that

(1:06:44) it is fair to create a limited democracy that in turn disenfranchises voters on

(1:06:50) the basis of being stupid i don't think that there is any way to practically enact that i don't

(1:06:56) understand why we would do enact it with a constitutional convention that's how you would do it and you don't

(1:07:03) think that the millions of people who now have lost the right to vote would they just they'd be like "Okay." Uh well

(1:07:09) they wouldn't have a choice i mean sure protests riots there's all

(1:07:16) sorts of ways that people have fought against a government i mean would you like you're basically trying to call the

(1:07:21) country's bluff on whether or not they care about having the right to vote which I think is just stupid i think

(1:07:26) personally it's pointless and I think that the function of a democracy is to make sure that everyone who has to abide

(1:07:32) by these laws is represented in government is that flawed yes that's not even true like that's Are you going to

(1:07:38) let me Did I interrupt just let her finish then we're moving oh we're moving on okay so finish your thing then we're going to move on okay so anyway back to

(1:07:44) my statement yes this government is flawed yes NOS's have too much power yes it's annoying when stupid people do

(1:07:50) stupid things but at the same time the right to vote is a human right under a

(1:07:55) representative democracy in the United States of America to take that away from voters is not the answer to creating a

(1:08:03) more educated voting body like just genuinely it's just not all right here's

(1:08:08) what we're going to do we have a couple chats that are going to come through guys if you want to interact with the

(1:08:14) the stream the show the debaters $200 TTS and also if you're enjoying the

(1:08:19) stream kindly like the video if you want to support Venmo Cash App whatever pod without these platforms taking their cut

() 

(1:08:25) we're also live on twitch.tv/w whatever if you want to drop us a follow on the prime sub also we have some merch shop

(1:08:31) whatever.com discord.gg/whatever we have a message here from One Moment here he paid 900

(1:08:39) wait he paid $99 to send a message yeah we have this one coming in from PeaceCraft oh the audio is muted

(1:08:47) uh or actually it's not muted i'm not sure why that's not coming through i'll just

(1:08:53) read i have a question for Rick James if you hadn't eaten breakfast this morning how would you feel

(1:08:59) uh I think that's for you how would you feel if you hadn't How would you feel if you hadn't eaten breakfast this morning

(1:09:06) i don't just how would I feel hungry probably okay all right and we

(1:09:12) have a message here from Jason Cassell related to the military stuff thank you

(1:09:17) Jason jason Castle donated $200 appreciate it thank you her boyfriend is an ASVAB waiver you can't get someone

(1:09:24) else to take the test you are have to be verified with ID fingerprints birth

(1:09:30) certificate SS etc also you take it during MEPS is it very good thank you

(1:09:37) Jason for that that's how I remember it i remember taking it during MEPS in your singular year in the army how did you

(1:09:43) get off with one year well people get hurt oh well that sucks that's what happens you didn't go back we have Red

(1:09:50) Fox here in the military 19 years and run uh MEPS all applicants take an IQ

(1:09:55) test it is called the ASVAB and we take significant steps to catch fraud the armed services on average well I agree

(1:10:01) that there can be stupid people who are there i'm just saying that there are standards which are in place that's one

(1:10:07) and two I remember specifically taking it when I was in MEPS so So how hard would this IQ test be

(1:10:13) for voters on your whole life well I didn't really advocate for an IQ test it would

(1:10:19) just be I would be you would just be looking for like if somebody was going to enter into service that they had at least the IQ capacity to do it so they

() 

(1:10:27) weren't like mentally [ __ ] well I mean isn't the whole point that we're trying to prevent stupid people from voting that's your whole No no

(1:10:33) uninformed voters from voting okay so how does community service inform a

(1:10:38) voter well so again I you keep what you keep doing is conflating like four different things when I say there's

(1:10:45) here's all of our possible options yeah right um and then you're like well there's problems with this one i agree

(1:10:51) there's problems within the confines of each of these but there's some that you just straight up reject and give no

(1:10:57) arguments for like why is it that we can't just eliminate it from 18 to 35 if you can't be president of the United

(1:11:03) States till you're 35 seems feasible that you can't vote until you're 35 well if the laws still apply to you between

(1:11:09) 18 to 35 yeah so then your objection is not even to the system your objection is actually just still what your argument

(1:11:15) is which is a contradiction what's Hold on question pause pause but what's to prevent can a can a person over 35 be an

(1:11:22) uninformed voter yes or no yes but it's going to be way less regular than people who are young how are you proving that

(1:11:30) just because if we look at the people who turn out to vote right within these

(1:11:35) demographics right it's much less than in the older demographics and when they're pulled the people in older demographics know much more about the

(1:11:42) issues than the people in the younger demographics really i don't know my grandma gets all her news from Facebook

(1:11:47) we have a message here manny fresh question for Naima did I say it right oh my god naima okay just question has she

(1:11:53) ever actually studied Plato's ship of state what's an actually intellectual philosophical counterpoint against this

(1:12:00) biggest issue with socialism and communism also why are you dating your oppressor what typical okay I'm feminist

(1:12:07) let's No response there okay all right guys if you want to get a message in uh we're going to do $200 TTS uh we let a

(1:12:14) couple below the threshold just come through there why don't we bring it back to feminism Andrew force doctrine force

(1:12:22) so there we go yeah we're fine with that but if you if she takes it down a rabbit hole then we have to go down the rabbit

(1:12:28) hole so here's my argument do let's start with defining these terms can we do that sure yes so I define

() 

(1:12:36) feminism okay as being uh a movement towards egalitarianism or

(1:12:42) equity mhm okay with the um stated goal of diminishing

(1:12:50) and eventually destroying patriarchal systems sure

(1:12:56) that seems to be fairly historically accurate and modernly accurate yes

(1:13:02) movement towards equity goal of um eliminating patriarchal systems yes okay I'll take it okay so um when I say the

(1:13:11) word going forward enforcer what I mean by that word is people who utilize

(1:13:16) inside of society some form of force or uh in order to either execute laws right

(1:13:24) or keep people safe in some capacity that would be an enforcer okay so my

(1:13:29) argument here is that men ultimately uh are the enforcement arm of everybody's

(1:13:36) rights including other men's and that women always have to appeal to other men and so they can't actually get rid of

(1:13:43) the patriarchy but must instead comply with the patriarchy okay

(1:13:49) that's my argument sure do you want to repeat that for me just so I can take a little note yeah that

(1:13:55) that women basically feminists always have to appeal to the patriarchy for rights no matter what and so feminism

(1:14:00) isn't even possible it's not even a possibility okay um appeal to patriarchy for rights okay

(1:14:09) so can I ask Mhm do you believe that

(1:14:14) free will is a privilege or a right or a privilege do you believe free will is a

(1:14:20) right or a privilege does free will just mean do whatever you want um within the extent that you're not hurting yourself

(1:14:26) or others or becoming a danger to society well then yeah it sure sounds like you're saying it is i'm sorry what

() 

(1:14:33) then it would be trivially true that it would have to be if you're saying that

(1:14:38) that means you can do whatever you want unless A B C and D then it would have to be a privilege well okay so free will as

(1:14:46) I'm defining it is the right to do with you what you want so long as you are not infringing upon another's free will then

(1:14:51) it would trivially have to be a privilege it would have to be a privilege like by that logic it would there would be no way around it it would

(1:14:58) have to be a privilege why would it have to be a privilege well because the second you do infringe on someone's

(1:15:04) whatever right yeah do you have free will well yes to an extent okay so free will

(1:15:12) with some limitations let's say is free will with the limitation then it's not free will well what do you want to call

(1:15:17) it Andrew i mean I just maybe will okay do you think that human will is a right

(1:15:25) or a privilege um I'm

(1:15:31) not trying to figure out what you mean by this human will like do you think that we as a societ How about maybe I

(1:15:37) can just do it this way i don't believe that human beings have inherent rights okay thank you there we go human beings

(1:15:44) have no inherent rights mhm yeah correct i think instead what we

(1:15:52) call rights are actually just collective intuitions which are in appeal to to

(1:15:58) force and then force enforces them okay so all law are you trying to say that

(1:16:03) basically all laws are enforced through force or just Yeah so all all laws ultimately all laws are enforced by

(1:16:09) force okay yeah so if you think about this the way that I would say is like do you agree with me that rights themselves

(1:16:16) are a social construction

(1:16:22) i mean not really so my right to own a gun is not a social construction

(1:16:28) yeah but I'm talking about free will not like human like what is that i don't understand though like you being able to

(1:16:34) act in will i wouldn't dispute with like you can that's what I'm saying you can have you can take actions with your will

(1:16:41) but when you say rights you're saying that those are privileges absent duties that's a right and then a uh a duty

(1:16:50) right would be essentially the opposite of what a right is right yes okay so

(1:16:56) these privileges that you're talking about I think if that's what a right is a privilege absent a duty then they all

() 

(1:17:02) seem like they're privileges okay but like you don't think that I

(1:17:08) guess my issue with this argument is that it's claiming that power is based

(1:17:14) solely on force which to me seems like it's advocating on behalf of violence i

(1:17:22) mean in order to enforce and maintain well yeah that's that that's what force would be raw force would be violence

(1:17:28) okay so that's what it does like we we advocate that police be able to use violence in order to enforce laws right

(1:17:34) but we would prefer that they avoid it right yeah but ultimately the what what makes people comply

(1:17:41) the threat of violence right but there are other ways to get people to comply now yeah but what if they don't

(1:17:48) well I mean yes but I feel like that's a bit of an extreme like no it's not a bit of an extreme that people don't comply

(1:17:54) but how does the president have power he can't threaten violence against all he does he is the commander-in-chief of the

(1:18:00) United States military but he can't threaten and com so basically you believe that we function in a society

(1:18:07) solely because if we don't we will be violently hurt by the military

(1:18:14) what no i believe that what that all of your privileges that you have in society

(1:18:21) that you're calling rights only actually exist because of force the idea of force

(1:18:26) and force doctrine and that that is basically 100% men who provide that okay

(1:18:32) so you're kind of giving this like might makes right argument just makes not

(1:18:39) makes right so just might is right no just makes not makes right right would

(1:18:44) be a prescriptive ought claim for morality i'm making a descriptive claim

(1:18:49) which is that descriptively might makes so do you not believe that violence is immoral

(1:18:55) uh of course not depends on the circumstance you generally just don't believe that violence is immoral it

() 

(1:19:00) depends on the circumstance i mean violence in an attempt to control others and use again that depends on the

(1:19:07) circumstance i think there's plenty of times where you and I would agree that using violence to control others is totally acceptable i feel like violence

(1:19:13) is necessary in self-defense and the No you don't you think that violence is completely acceptable to control prison

(1:19:19) inmates probably to uh uh to execute certain laws and search warrants to do

(1:19:24) all sorts of things violence is very again those are both actions in self-defense or defense of others how is

(1:19:30) that two inmates are fighting when you're when you're saying you break up that fight violence to but it's violence

(1:19:36) to control others right but it would be in defense of others yeah but it's still to control others it's in defense of

(1:19:43) others what if those people like inmates don't want to be defended so that's what we're talking about well I mean if

(1:19:48) someone is beating another person to death I'm sure that the person It's mutual combat they both want to do it

(1:19:54) the the guards then go and break it up they're definitely using violence for control not die but fight okay but if

(1:20:00) someone is beating someone else to death and you are using but you see how you

(1:20:05) see how you negate the claim so you move to the next claim can two people be fighting and then you use violence to

(1:20:11) break that up yes okay great so then you can use violence to control people and it's perfectly acceptable it's not

(1:20:17) acceptable though because it's it's the reason it's acceptable is because it's in defense of another person those

(1:20:22) people want to fight who are you defending if one of them is dying or if one of them is one of them is not dying they

(1:20:29) just want to fight they're not dying but they just want to fight okay sure so two

(1:20:34) prison inmates but again you're using these like really really really stringently specific yeah because if I

(1:20:40) if we go too broad and too general then if we hone it down then I can negate

(1:20:45) your stance because what you're saying doesn't actually make logical sense but you're honing it down to a specific

(1:20:51) example that is not representative of the entire population of the United States i feel like we should use an

(1:20:56) example what is representative of the entire population not two prisoners who choose to fight to the death i mean

(1:21:02) that's the furthest thing no no but do you when you make a claim you make this claim you say Andrew um violence is only

(1:21:10) just or you violence isn't justified to control groups of people and I'm like "Yeah but you don't really believe that

(1:21:17) because I can give you examples of groups of people who you would want to control with violence and you think it's totally acceptable." And you're like

(1:21:22) "Yeah that's true." Well those people have lost by committing but but hang on you go "Yeah that's true." But right I

(1:21:30) still now don't want to use that example it's like "That makes no sense it it's it's a reputation to your position

(1:21:36) that's why I hone in on it." Okay so people we know this through the constitution essentially relinquish

(1:21:42) their right to free will by threatening the free will of others that's why prisoners are allowed to go to jail and that is constitutionally accepted yes

(1:21:50) say that let me make sure I got that right say that again people essentially relinquish their right to free will the

(1:21:55) right to walk around and be free in society as a prisoner because they have committed a crime that is a danger to

(1:22:02) themselves or others and threatens the fabric of society so why do people go to jail why are crimes crimes why are

(1:22:09) things that are bad people go to jail because we force them into jail after they commit crimes not because they're

(1:22:14) willingly going to jail for I understand that they're not willingly going to jail but what I'm saying is the forced

(1:22:20) relinquishment of free will in this instance is morally acceptable because they have committed a crime that

(1:22:26) threatens themselves or others yeah I'm not disputing whether or not it's moral that would make my point for me though

(1:22:31) so I'm not trying to talk about those who have already had their free will relinquished on the basis that they have

(1:22:37) committed a crime that threatens themselves or others i'm trying to talk about people who are not criminals who

(1:22:44) have not relinquished their free will who are here in this country and deserve the right to choose what they do with

(1:22:49) themselves and their bodies no okay well I mean you're making a lot of suppositions there that I just kind

(1:22:55) of like don't agree with so you don't think that people deserve the right to bodily autonomy no what makes someone

() 

(1:23:03) deserve the right to bodily autonomy well when you say bodily autonomy would you agree then that a fetus has bodily

(1:23:09) autonomy i'm talking right now about human beings well I consider those human

(1:23:15) beings though i'm talking right now about people who can talk and walk who are independent singular organisms so

(1:23:21) people who are in comas they they have no rights dude you keep doing comas and

(1:23:26) prisoners and fetuses just talk about a [ __ ] person what about you that is a person just talk about a person who is

(1:23:33) not an exception who is not in a medical state of physical but what we're trying

(1:23:38) to determine right now is is the worldview you say people deserve to have

(1:23:44) uh bodily autonomy and then you give me the criteria for bodily autonomy and then I can instantly point to an example

(1:23:50) where you agree that that's not what we're trying to do what you're trying to do is create a gotcha so you don't have to answer the genuine question that I'm

(1:23:56) asking what's the genuine question you're asking the question is do people regardless of outliers does the average

(1:24:03) person who has not committed a crime who is not inside of another person who is not brain dead or in a coma deserve

(1:24:11) bodily autonomy depending on what you mean by that bodily autonomy being

(1:24:16) defined as the ability to choose what you do with your body so long as you are not threatening other people's bodily

(1:24:23) autonomy no why not because uh I would say that things like laws against

(1:24:28) unaliving yourself would be completely appropriate and things like this which would be a violation of your bodily

(1:24:34) autonomy by your criteria so you think that because people can't

(1:24:39) unalive themselves no I'm saying you gave me the criteria for what bodily autonomy means right you asked me what

(1:24:47) an objection would be against it and I just gave you one okay so let's cut out that outlier do you think that people

(1:24:53) who are not inside another person who have not committed a violent crime against themselves or others and who

(1:25:00) have not are not currently brain dead and are conscious and capable of perceiving the world mhm do you think

(1:25:07) that those people deserve bodily autonomy no based on the example I just gave you just because people have the

(1:25:13) capacity to unalive themselves no one deserves bodily autonomy by the definition that you just gave we could

(1:25:19) not give them bodily autonomy definitionally by that definition because definitely by that definition

(1:25:25) definitionally by that definition yes so I could say definitionally by some other definition but I'm giving you the

(1:25:31) reference to your definition we don't deserve bodily autonomy not by your definition if because that would prevent

(1:25:36) us from preventing people from like doing suicide and things like this so we don't deserve bodily autonomy because

(1:25:42) under my definition of bodily autonomy we cannot prevent someone from killing themselves correct

(1:25:48) but that's not a violent act like why yeah that's a real violent act why can't

(1:25:53) under my definition you can't prevent someone from killing themselves because it it it would know it would violate

(1:25:58) your rule for what bodily autonomy is i said so long as you are not a threat to yourself or others so that includes you

(1:26:04) so you would relinquish your bodily autonomy if you were a threat to yourself then I think that it would then just be trivially true that you don't

(1:26:11) really mean bodily autonomy anymore because what you do is you say bodily autonomy with all of these exceptions

(1:26:16) where we can violate bodily autonomy but that's like three exceptions it's exceptions that it's not like three

(1:26:22) exceptions it's many exceptions what about somebody who's just like cutting themselves with a razor blade can we stop them what about a person who just

(1:26:29) says that they want to cut off their right arm cuz they think it'll be fun can we stop them like there's so many

(1:26:34) examples I can give you of where we would violate people's bodily autonomy what about a person who's having like a manic episode and doesn't want to go to

(1:26:41) the hospital can we violate their bodily autonomy they're a threat to themselves or others so again that would fall in the What if they're not a threat what if

(1:26:47) they're just having like a manic episode they don't want to leave their house you just perceive it that way that happens all the time exactly so you we violate

(1:26:53) that whatever you consider what you're by your definition of bodily autonomy and you say "Do people deserve that?" And I say "Absolutely not by that

(1:27:00) definition because I can point to 300 different reasons why we would need to violate it." So is there any definition

(1:27:06) of bodily autonomy that you think that a Not that I'm aware of i'm not aware of a definition of bodily autonomy I would

(1:27:12) agree to that I wouldn't think we should be able to violate so you don't think that people should have the ability to

(1:27:17) control themselves and their bodies under any circumstance because I didn't say under any circumstance what's the

(1:27:24) circumstance in which people should have the right to control their body yeah so well for me I would say that if it's in

(1:27:30) some type of case of will um that you could do that but I mean ultimately I

(1:27:36) think free will yeah no in case of will so I'm not sure that I believe in some

(1:27:41) universalized right for bodily autonomy and you haven't really given me any

(1:27:46) definitional reason why I should have but I don't understand why you don't believe in bodily autonomy why don't My

(1:27:53) understanding of what bodily autonomy is is that you basically have the right to do whatever you want absent the

(1:27:58) infringement of somebody else's bodily autonomy yes why don't you think people should because I think that I need to

() 

(1:28:04) many times infringe on people's bodily autonomy for their good or societies why are you constantly infringing on other

(1:28:09) people's bodily autonomy what are you up to what do you mean what you just said i feel the need to Yeah well I would use

(1:28:15) force doctrine for that meaning voting things like that to violate a forcing when are you forcing when I go vote

(1:28:24) i'm forcing my will when I go vote on other people through forced doctrine no you're not cuz they all have a vote

(1:28:30) great can I vote not according to you but I can I can vote and you can vote right yes okay you want abortions to be

(1:28:37) legal yes if I vote against that am I voting against your bodily autonomy yes thank you okay can we move on now no we

(1:28:44) can't move on no no we can't move on okay well Andrew you still haven't explained why humans don't deserve

(1:28:49) bodily autonomy like what are I just explained it to you so then who could should control people i Well in this

(1:28:55) case we would use we would use groupings of laws under from my view it would be like Christian ethics from your view it

(1:29:02) would be like I don't know shared bizarre intuitions or whatever where you think that I don't know i don't know

(1:29:07) where it is that what I believe so do you believe in God i'm on the fence about then it's just intuition so

(1:29:14) everything that you believe probably just intuition so you believe Well I mean there's also facts and like physical evidence but you know um so you

(1:29:21) believe facts and physical evidence require an interpreter right like eyes and ears they require they would require

(1:29:28) you to interpret them so you're saying that facts are different for everyone regardless of how they interpret well

(1:29:34) they require an interpreter and the interpreter can interpret them however they choose and then can make moral prescriptions based on those but when we

(1:29:40) get to the moral prescriptions facts don't change based on your but your moral prescriptions based on the facts

(1:29:46) do that's why they're Yeah they require interpreters so I'm not really willing to kind of seed the ground but you are

(1:29:53) your own personal interpreter now yeah I interpret things correct yeah yes okay and so do I that's just we all see facts

(1:30:01) and then we make judgments about those facts right but I have an epistemic foundation that I appeal to for

(1:30:07) foundational morals you don't you would just that everyone should have to subscribe to the Christian God and that is who decides who has free will i think

(1:30:13) that Christian ethic I'm confused as to what that we're not even we weren't talking about free will okay so then what we're talking about bodily autonomy

(1:30:20) now okay so then based on based on your definition of bodily autonomy the one that you gave me we would definitely

(1:30:26) need to violate it and you even agree to that and what just for abortion or what no

(1:30:34) for the purpose of like suicide cutting yourself with razor blades uh all sorts of various things that you could do to

(1:30:39) yourself for self harm that we would step in and violate your bodily autonomy over okay so outside of those specific

(1:30:48) examples in which someone is committing an act of harm which I also remove from my definition of bodily then I don't

(1:30:53) consider that bodily autonomy anymore by your definition your definition would have to be something different the right to go to the [ __ ] grocery store who

(1:31:00) has that right who are you saying under your standpoint of government what is it

(1:31:05) based on your equal force objection can women do that they should not be allowed so let's untangle some ideas when you

(1:31:11) say who has a right to go to a grocery store who has an inherent right to go to a grocery store or who has a a physical

(1:31:19) right enforced by men to go to a grocery store which thing are you asking what do you an inherent right or some

() 

(1:31:27) external subjective right that is enforced which thing are you asking i'm saying who has an inherent right to move

(1:31:33) their body in Nobody nobody has an inherent right to do anything nobody nobody has an inherent right to do

(1:31:38) anything so then how do we gain the physical right to go to the grocery store through force exclusively through

(1:31:43) force yeah the only reason that like so if like let's say the Taliban took over like the the grocery store area do you

(1:31:50) have the right to go to the grocery store now no but that's an anarchy then you're agreeing with me so then you're

(1:31:56) saying there's no inherent right it sounds like you're advocating for anarchy and the only way that people advocating for anarchy the only way that

(1:32:02) people gain a right is through force then we'd all be fighting each other all the time to gain the right to just

(1:32:08) cooperate for the purpose of force doctrine we do it constantly what do you mean no we don't cuz we don't live under

(1:32:14) a force doctrine principle yes we do well how would old people have the power to do anything how would disabled people have the power and no one can defend

(1:32:21) themselves because they have people who have force which enable them to do those things that's how so then there is power

(1:32:27) that comes not from force if people who do not have the power to force can

(1:32:33) utilize the strength of others on their behalf the strength of others would be force okay but how did that person at

(1:32:39) the top who doesn't have force utilize the strength of others he's utilizing other people's force okay but what is he

(1:32:46) doing to utilize their force cuz he somehow has power over them how he doesn't have well it's agreed to power

(1:32:52) but the thing about power dynamics which is interesting is that if you have control over force if that were to shift

(1:32:58) like let's say the president said some [ __ ] that you really didn't like and a big ass mob showed up to take him out

(1:33:04) right and nobody opposed that who has force doctrine on their side that's fair so I want to go back to this claim you

(1:33:10) said "Hang on hang on before we go back to my claim Hang on hang on hang on force." Wait wait wait and I would like

(1:33:16) to just ask Hang on you said that's fair though right you said that's fair no I'm

(1:33:21) You said that's fair i'm responding to the words you're saying if you said agreed to power based on force

(1:33:28) and that those who are disabled are protected and their will is protected and those who are elderly are protected

(1:33:33) and their will is to protect if there's force yeah then why can't you do the same thing with women why do women now usurp their right to protection and

(1:33:40) bodily autonomy under there's not rights these aren't rights it's just force can like can women like manipulate men to

(1:33:47) use force on their behalf sure that's happened before great but they're always going to have to appeal to men's

(1:33:53) strength for force no matter what but I don't think society is intrinsically and implicitly governed by force and I think

(1:33:58) advocating for that which part of society violence which part of society is not governed by force which part um I

(1:34:06) mean schools aren't governed by force yes they're governed by force for sure really so kids go to school because

(1:34:12) they're afraid they're going to get No they're not going to school because they're afraid they're going to get hurt but there's security guards who are around there's police officers are

(1:34:18) around there's people who enable that nothing bad's going to happen to those kids there's teachers who are there much stronger than the students to keep

(1:34:24) potential threats away from the students all of it's governed by force okay but you're talking about force for protection versus force for the

(1:34:31) utilization and monopoly of power it's all the same thing it's not the same thing if you're protecting people's

(1:34:36) right to be somewhere then that is a different use of force than But they're both force sure okay great then they're

(1:34:43) the same thing force sure but why are you just because you have a monopoly on

(1:34:48) force what gives you the will to usurp someone's right to very basic bodily

(1:34:56) they don't have rights rights are not by your agreement inherent so then what's

(1:35:01) to stop a bigger stronger man from just beating the [ __ ] out of you and now you don't have right nothing except force doctrine that's the whole point then why

(1:35:08) would you want to live in a society in which everyone is like I didn't say you have to live in a society in which

(1:35:14) individuals can get beaten up by somebody who's next to them that's what force doctrine is no force doctrine would be like the cops would show up and

(1:35:21) beat that guy down with ba billy clubs drag his ass to prison then he would get thrown into a prison where guards would

(1:35:28) make sure he stayed there okay so force is appropriate through force doctrine well I don't even know what that means

(1:35:34) what are you asking so the force and the power to I mean you're basically saying

(1:35:40) that women do not have the right to I don't know because you won't define what

(1:35:46) rights are to do really anything okay i'll tell you again what did I say a right is a duty i'm sorry a privilege

(1:35:54) absent a duty and you agreed to it four times some women have no privilege of a duty stop stop i just want to point out

(1:35:59) your lie you said I so frustrated you said I keep lying or you keep lying so

(1:36:05) when did I lie Bookie you just said I never defined privilege no I didn't yes

(1:36:10) you literally just said that and I defined it four times you didn't say you didn't define privilege you didn't define privilege you defined it right

(1:36:18) oh my god a privilege absent duty is what a privilege absent of a duty i'd

(1:36:26) say like free will a right it's a right i defined it multiple times so what are you trying to say that because women

(1:36:33) cannot defend physically their right to do things that they do not deserve

(1:36:39) rights is that the point they can't enforce their own rights so that's okay so because someone cannot enforce their

(1:36:45) own rights they don't deserve rights well they don't have them but do they deserve them well you're at

(1:36:52) again moving into a different claim so if you want to get into like what people

(1:36:57) deserve or don't deserve right uh we can get into that but can we at least agree

(1:37:03) on the descriptor of how it works first no okay because women I'm trying to

(1:37:09) understand why women don't deserve rights because they cannot fight that's a different claim i just asked you if we

(1:37:15) could agree to the descriptor before we moved to that claim and you said no and then brought that claim up again because the claim doesn't make sense i don't

(1:37:21) understand your claim make the claim i'm literally answering all of your questions for this claim not well though

(1:37:27) like what are you saying which question which thing am I not answering if women do not have a monopoly on force cannot

(1:37:34) control their own bodies why don't they deserve basic human

(1:37:39) rights basic equal rights okay let's try this again it's like talking to a [ __ ] child okay do you have Do you

(1:37:46) agree with me no okay do you agree with me i've never seen you

(1:37:51) this pissed off this is [ __ ] hilarious oh my god i'm not pissed off i'm just Yes you are and they say women

(1:37:56) are emotional look at him you're the one freaking out not me i'm not freaking out i think this is hilarious for me it's

(1:38:02) extremely frustrating talking to someone doesn't actually understand the words that are coming out of my mouth he's

(1:38:07) sounding very emotional right now andrew can we go back would you like to get some water yeah can we go back and go through all If you need to cry that's

(1:38:13) okay can we go back i'm here for you my friend can we go back through these descriptors now sure okay all righty you

(1:38:19) guys want to keep defining words what is Marian Webster over here what is right from your perspective okay i mean I'm

(1:38:26) fine with your definition on those descriptors no but I want your definition i'm fine with your definition of that then why do you keep

() 

(1:38:31) contradicting yourself if you're fine with my definition i'm not contradicting myself your claim just doesn't make sense that humans do not deserve rights

(1:38:37) specifically because they cannot physically when did I say they didn't deserve them you just did like I said they don't exist inherently right okay

(1:38:46) so whether or not it doesn't exist inherently does someone still deserve that right just because they cannot

(1:38:52) physically defend themselves how do you deserve something that doesn't exist but it does exist okay so now it exists does

(1:39:00) it exist or not exist i mean do I have bodily autonomy currently yes can I go walk around my house and do what I want

(1:39:05) yes so on a certain level it does exist where i mean right here right now i'm

(1:39:11) here on my own free will so because you can do this pissing you the [ __ ] off so because you can do this you have the right to do this i'm trying to see what

(1:39:17) extent you think women should not be allowed to do things because they cannot monopolize and control others based on

(1:39:24) Do you understand that like I just don't understand practically what you want out of this so women can't force it's hard

(1:39:31) to it's hard to argue with you because you don't have any understanding of philosophy at all so when I bring these

(1:39:36) things up that's not the issue the issue is that your philosophy is flawed it's on it morally doesn't make sense okay

(1:39:42) i'll tell you what negate it negate the proposition okay sure um with what I

(1:39:49) said before so you're basically saying that people who utilize force to execute laws are those who have the ability to

(1:39:55) control those laws my issue is that and in terms of a movement towards equity or

(1:40:01) a goal of eliminating and in terms of feminism you're saying it's a movement towards equity with the goal of eliminating patriarchal systems my issue

(1:40:09) is that I fundamentally do not believe that laws should be exclusively

(1:40:16) enforced to the benefit of those who have physical power okay that's not a

(1:40:21) negation of force doctrine so like I don't know what to you're

(1:40:27) you're so philosophically illiterate that you actually don't even understand what I'm saying to you and you're just regularly illiterate i mean dude like

(1:40:33) then just argue the claim i did argue the claim but it doesn't make sense then falsify it okay just because someone can

(1:40:39) do something does not mean that they ought to do it just because men can force women to do what they want doesn't

(1:40:46) mean that they ought to so then descriptively do you agree with force doctrine

(1:40:51) i mean I believe on a like blanket I believe on like a smaller level i think that

(1:40:57) interpersonally someone can um use force if they have more force

(1:41:03) over something okay let's try this what is force doctrine force doctrine is your whole thing that men have a monopoly on

(1:41:09) force and human beings have no inherent rights all laws are enforced by force

(1:41:15) and violence is used to maintain um societal regularity on a certain

(1:41:21) level and that women have to appeal to men for the their monopoly on force in order to secure their whatever needs or

(1:41:28) rights or whatever it is they want right that's part of force doctrine sure okay do you then do you agree with

(1:41:36) the description do you agree the description is true you said I agreed with the description

(1:41:42) that's I asked you four times if you agreed with the description i agreed with it four times well one time I said

(1:41:48) no to piss you off but then the other times I said yes so you agreed with me that when it comes to force doctrine you

(1:41:54) agree to the descriptor being true sure okay now we can get somewhere maybe that's what I said oh my god i mean you

(1:42:01) never did but okay i did Andrew so now that we can get uh past that now that

(1:42:07) you've agreed to force doctrine can you tell me why men should enforce women's rights

(1:42:13) why men should enforce women's rights i don't necessarily think that I Well I

(1:42:18) think that free will is honestly a privilege i mean not a privilege i think that free will is a right i think that everyone has the right to bottle then

() 

(1:42:25) you don't agree to force doctrine why'd you lie to me why did you lie to me you asked me if I agreed with your

(1:42:30) definition i agree with your definition of it i don't morally agree with it that's Well if we don't agree with the

(1:42:36) descriptor then we again we have to argue the descriptor until you either falsify the descriptor or or agree with

(1:42:44) the descriptor it can't be either or it has to be either or it can't be can't be anything else it's either true or it's

(1:42:49) false i just want to understand your moral justification for controlling someone else's body i'm talking on a moral basis not that you can't

(1:42:56) physically i understand that you can physically i agree with the premise that's nice but I should ask why but I

(1:43:04) asked you a question and he didn't answer it why should men enforce women's rights why should

(1:43:12) they because it is morally inaccible to control others it is morally impermissible that's the opposite you're

(1:43:18) not controlling if you're enforcing their rights it sounds like they're controlling you right like how are you

(1:43:25) controlling them by enforcing their rights but right is simply as we've defined it a privilege without a diction

(1:43:32) so why should men enforce women's privileges but they don't have to so what are you defining answer my question

(1:43:37) why should men enforce women's privileges they don't have to enforce women's privileges great i think I think

(1:43:43) I Great i believe the exact same thing perfect i'm going to go they don't have to enforce Oh my goodness he's a He's

(1:43:51) coming back he's just going to do a little smoke he's quit are you kidding you just agreed with my entire position

(1:43:57) oh [ __ ] the misogynist quit agree with you that men should not enforce women

(1:44:03) well you didn't let me finish the sentence well I don't really need to you conceded the debate no I did not concede the debate andrew you're just walking

(1:56:22) merch shop shopwever.com if you want to get yourself some merchandise we have Pasty George here

(1:56:28) oh Jesus pasty George donated to roast a little bit just warning yeah this female

(1:56:34) with locks on her head is a troll and argues in bad faith i understand

(1:56:39) Andrew's frustration because he is debating with a mentally handicapped person i actually would love to respond

(1:56:44) to that um so if I'm being completely honest with you Andrew I've been watching a few

(1:56:51) of your debates and I've noticed that you like to troll women specifically there was a video in which you made fun

(1:56:57) of disabled p person you made fun of their deaf accent um you do that

(1:57:02) consistently you've called women [ __ ] you've called I don't I literally just

(1:57:07) watched a video you didn't watch a video of me you called her a satanic prostitute [ __ ] you like If she was a

() 

(1:57:13) prostitute and a Satanist yes well she wasn't a Satanist she was a sex worker but no she was she was a Satanist am I

(1:57:19) answering the question or are you answering the question yeah but yeah I'm not going to let you direct i'm not going to let you lie she was a question

(1:57:24) if a person is a Satanist and a prostitute are they a satanic [ __ ] but she didn't call herself can you answer

(1:57:29) my question she didn't she didn't

(1:57:36) identify you see how that works yeah I see how that works do you Do you Here's what I'm trying to say you're so

(1:57:42) emotional calm down answer the question answer the question answer the question are you trying to upset me answer the

(1:57:48) question it's not working baby i don't know it looks like it's Looks like it's working it's really not it looks like it

(1:57:53) is it's really not yeah so is a woman who is a Satanist and a prostitute a satanic [ __ ] yes no the question

(1:57:58) directly thank you so then I was right and it's funny because you just said you don't call women [ __ ] and then you just called her a [ __ ] but no I make

(1:58:05) descriptive statements on what is a [ __ ] ask a question i don't think it was right make a descriptive statement a ridiculous amount of money to ask me a

(1:58:12) question and I would like to answer it i can't wait to hear it okay to be honest with you Andrew I think you debate in

(1:58:18) bad faith the whole concept of I'm trying to dominate my opponent is not necessarily the way to debate if you're

(1:58:25) trying to reach a common ground and create a mutual consensus that is a bad faith debate i literally

(1:58:31) just entire worldview to be up for internal critique i didn't even push

(1:58:37) back once and you still came to my conclusion without me pushing back at all that is the epitome of good faith we

(1:58:45) haven't gotten to your conclusion Andrew we did you agreed that men have no obligation to enforce male privilege

(1:58:51) after saying you descriptively agree with force doctrine but men also That's it done okay but men also have no obligation to enforce their own rights

(1:58:58) great so me like how do you create a society in which all rights and all

(1:59:04) privileges are based specifically on force to me that sounds like you already

(1:59:09) descriptively agreed and conceded that point but I'd like to move into feminism whenever you're ready i do not concede

(1:59:14) that point i mean you did but we have we have other topics to move into specifically your feminist view and

(1:59:20) since I stayed up to internal critique it is now your turn for your view okie dokie i fundamentally I mean I just

(1:59:27) don't think it's morally correct to say you do not deserve rights unless you What do you base your morality on i base

(1:59:33) my morality on like basic concepts of ethics contian morality rouso's philosophy of ethics i think that so

() 

(1:59:40) contean ethics you're a universalist ethicist you're a deontologist no I wouldn't say honestly i feel like

(1:59:46) neither consequentialism nor deontological ethics like fully encount so you're a threshold deontologist i

(1:59:52) don't know i think there's merit to both arguments okay okay so what do you base your morality on i think I base my

(1:59:57) morality on physically how you are impacting other people if you are hurting that would be consequences sure

(2:00:04) but intent does play kind of a part in consequence that would be consequences as well so if I have the intent to do

(2:00:10) good things and bad things happen to you you'd say I shouldn't do be doing those good things to you right no that's why I'm saying I think that there's a gray

(2:00:15) area between consequentialism and deontology so threshold deontology so okay great so you're a threshold

(2:00:21) deontologist can you tell me what you base that on other than your own personal perspective do you not believe

(2:00:27) that it's immoral it's not my turn to answer questions your turn for the internal critique i just Well I believe

(2:00:32) it's immoral to hurt other people it is inherently wrong to hurt others and what makes it inherently wrong well hurting

(2:00:38) other people is not You think that's good that's just you making the claim and then make you're it's called

(2:00:43) question begging it's a question begging fallacy when you you're questioning you continue to add do you even know what question begging means what does it mean

(2:00:50) oh my god what does it mean you're trying to catch me in a logical I'm answering you're trying to

(2:00:56) catch me in a logical fallacy that's not answering what does it mean

(2:01:02) question begging you're trying to catch your opponent what does it mean it doesn't mean you're trying to catch your opponent that's not what question

(2:01:08) begging means will you will you let me finish okay what's it mean you're trying to catch your opponent in a logical fallacy

(2:01:14) by asking them questions that inherently create a dissonance what the [ __ ] are

(2:01:22) you talking about that is not what the question begging fallacy is so then how do you define it when I It's not a

(2:01:27) definitional thing it's a facious thing when I ask you is this inherent you say listen it's inherent because it's

(2:01:34) inherent it's inherent because it's inherent that's not what I said great what makes it inherent what makes your

(2:01:39) morals inherent what makes not hurting somebody else being bad inherent

(2:01:44) you don't think that hurting other people That's asking me a question not answering it what makes hurting other people bad inherent inherently you are

(2:01:51) denying them the right to their bodily but what makes that bad it's bad because it's hurting them hurting but what makes

(2:01:58) that bad you don't think that hurting something that's asking me a question not answering it it's bad because it's

(2:02:05) immoral it's bad because it's bad now you have done a circular facious

(2:02:10) argument what is bad this thing over here that's bad what makes it bad the fact that it's bad why is it bad cuz

(2:02:16) it's bad is that why it's bad is it bad because it's bad because it's bad it is

(2:02:22) inherently wrong to hurt other people yeah what makes it inherently wrong to hurt other people it is inherently wrong to hurt other people because you are

(2:02:28) denying them their free will you are causing them physical pain and you are participating and exacerbating in

(2:02:34) suffrage suffering what makes that bad though you don't think that causing other people to asking me a question

(2:02:41) asking me what makes it bad doesn't describe for me what makes it bad hurting someone is bad because because

(2:02:47) you are denying them their right to but what makes that part bad and perpetuating suffering but what makes

(2:02:52) that part bad you don't think that suffering is bad no that has nothing to do with what I think it does have here's

(2:02:59) what here's here's how this conversation is going just so you know I'm like is eating candy bars bad and you're like

(2:03:04) it's bad say "What makes candy eating candy bars bad?" And you say "Well because it's unhealthy for you." And I say "But why is being unhealthy bad?"

(2:03:10) And you say "Cuz eating candy bars is bad." You are causing physical harm okay you are disrupting society so eating a

(2:03:16) donut is immoral i'm not talking about candy bars immoral is eating a donut immoral is eating a donut immoral no

(2:03:23) because you're not causing a physical harm to causing physical harm to someone else it is an exercise so is making

(2:03:28) donuts immoral no but you're even if people are going to eat them and it causes them harm but eating one doughnut

(2:03:34) is not going to cause someone physical harm if you eat a doughnut in excess then that causes someone physical harm

(2:03:40) but that is not something that you are policing if you make donuts and then force someone to buy and eat 10 donuts in front of you then that would be

(2:03:45) causing a physical harm when you say the word inherently what you mean is something which is like based inside the

() 

(2:03:52) human experience what do you mean by inherently i mean on an instinctual level does it not hurt someone to cause

(2:03:58) harm although of course there are people I'm just asking sociopath what do you mean by inherently i mean inherently as

(2:04:04) in on a very basic it is a fact inherent fact in inherently it means it's a fact

(2:04:11) i'm just saying inherently as in it is implicit throughout every culture well

(2:04:17) not every culture but like it's implicit okay inherently means implicit so it's so it means always like always something

(2:04:24) it's inherent it's like always this thing is that what that means i'm getting confused what the [ __ ] are you talking

(2:04:30) about i'm asking you what inherently means why don't we just Google it why i'm not I'm actually okay with you if you want to Google the definition of

(2:04:36) inherent yeah Brian can pull it up i'm not trying to get a a got you on the definition i just want the definition

(2:04:43) okay yeah then let's pull it up existing in something as a permanent essential or character characteristic that's what I

(2:04:49) said i said always so I just want to make sure hang on existing read the rest of it there's a few others do you want

(2:04:56) just the first one's fine okay existing in something as a permanent essential or characteristic attribute so it is a

(2:05:04) permanent attribute from your view that hurting somebody else is bad yes why because you

(2:05:12) are causing them physical harm which is a disruption to a disruption to social order

(2:05:19) why is that bad though well because you would have no social order we would not be able to progress

(2:05:24) as a society and physical harm is painful you are causing someone pain it

(2:05:29) is bad to cause someone pain i think that's but you just keep do you understand like what you keep saying is

(2:05:35) it's bad because it's bad well it's causing it's bad because it's bad you are taking something away from someone

(2:05:42) which is their physical like just capability so if if it were the case

(2:05:48) that most of society most of society believed that enslavement was fine

(2:05:54) because it was inherent that some people were allowed to own other people would

(2:05:59) that be bad but that's not an inherent truth well what makes physically hurting

(2:06:05) someone else an inherent truth physically hurting someone else is an inherent truth because you are denying

(2:06:11) them bodily autonomy and the ability to control what happens to their body and you were causing a net negative to that

(2:06:18) person yeah but you haven't actually told me why that part of that is bad though causing a net negative to others

(2:06:24) is bad on every single moral like as a Christian you should know why c hurting

(2:06:29) other people is bad i know why Christians think so i don't know why you think so i think so because again you're

(2:06:35) robbing them of their bodily autonomy yeah but you don't tell me why that's actually bad so you start this is what

(2:06:41) makes it question begging you start with the assumption as the conclusion you start with the premise as a conclusion

(2:06:47) hurting people is bad because it's bad to hurt people yes that's your position no I'm saying

(2:06:54) hurting people is bad because you are robbing them of their physical autonomy and you are creating a ne negative to

(2:06:59) another person so if you could hurt people collectively in some way and it causes good outcomes would that be bad

(2:07:06) yes well then you just negated what makes it bad well that's because I'm not

(2:07:11) a consequentialist then why are you making the claim that this is bad if even the good results are

(2:07:16) still bad but it's not a good result if you are hurting people at a net negative if it is a net negative then it is not

(2:07:23) good if hurting people Uhhuh is a universal net negative to those people

(2:07:30) and the more people you hurt the more negative it is

(2:07:35) then hurting people in that instance is also bad what makes it a net negative though physically harming someone is

(2:07:42) negative to them you are causing pain which is a negative to them okay and do you agree that there are some groups who

(2:07:50) maybe have negative outlooks that you need to cause pain to if they are hurting other people and the negative of

(2:07:56) those people is outweighing the negative of hurting them then potentially i mean what if they just refuse to comply but

(2:08:02) that's why like going back to the force theory that's why force is used in some

(2:08:10) situations to control others mhm and it is used immorally when it is not controlling someone who is comp who is

(2:08:17) putting a net negative i want to tell you about a little island called Papa New Guinea oh god on this little island

(2:08:24) called Papa New Guinea uh there's a tribe called the [ __ ] warriors of Papa New Guinea you might

(2:08:30) think I'm making this up if I'm not no I feel like I've heard of this before this isolated tribe in Papa New Guinea what

(2:08:35) they enjoy doing is um well they have the the Yets of the tribe the younglings

() 

(2:08:44) um who are male go over and blow all of the adults essentially the YTS they go

(2:08:50) over and like service them let's say okay that's what they do yeah however when psychologists go and look at this

(2:08:58) the kids there actually demand to do this because it's a part of their culture now me as a Christian I would

(2:09:05) say that's inherently bad right why would you what what basis could you have

(2:09:11) to justify if there's no negative outcome which is what you're saying bad is

(2:09:17) if there's no negative outcome well there is a negative outcome they're demanding to do it yeah but psychologically pedophilia does have an

(2:09:23) inherently negative outcome pdf let's say PDF right but on top of that right even when you say that the psychologist

(2:09:31) said that they were demanding to do this it's part of their cultural right they're demanding it they don't

(2:09:38) want to not be adults in the culture me as a Christian I would go in there and put an end into that [ __ ] [ __ ] in one

(2:09:44) second i would put bring my military in there and I would kick them on the [ __ ] ground and I'd take those kids

(2:09:50) out of there and be like "Fuck that a tribe like that doesn't even deserve to exist that's what I would do." Okay okay

(2:09:57) but from your perspective why is that bad if there's no psychological damage

(2:10:04) they're demanding to do it why is that bad yeah I don't really know honestly i'll

(2:10:10) concede that one now I do have a question in terms of the use of force

(2:10:16) you don't I just want to make sure that it's on record that you just said that you don't know why it is that an entire

(2:10:21) tribe that does this with children is bad i just want to make sure that you are clear that you just said that i

(2:10:29) think it's bad because P3DO is inherently bad because it is inherently

(2:10:34) psychologically damaging to children even if they demand to do it even if there's no even if the ramifications of

(2:10:40) the removal of them doing that the kids fight tooth and nail to go back to do that because they want to be part of the

(2:10:45) manhood of the tribe i'm sorry what so even if you try to get

(2:10:51) them away from doing that they demand to go back and do that right they they're demanding it what's the greater

(2:10:57) psychological harm then the greater psychological harm is in I would say

(2:11:03) it's a net negative to encourage and endorse pedophilia well you're not you're not it's an isolated tribe it's

(2:11:09) not being endorsed by anybody anywhere well I mean if you were there and you

(2:11:15) had the opportunity to prevent it and you didn't yeah but why would you from your worldview try to prevent something which is only bad by the metrics that

(2:11:22) you stated that it causes harm when this isn't causing harm i don't believe that psychologically it doesn't cause harm

(2:11:29) though but okay but wouldn't there be a worse psychological ramification if you separate them and they absolutely demand

(2:11:35) to go back and like willing to kill to get back to their tribe to do this

(2:11:40) okay so I mean I don't know it sounds an awful lot like you're defending PDF file i don't think I'm defending PDF it

(2:11:46) sounds like you're defending PDF files pdf file is immoral well but why you just keep saying because inherently it

(2:11:51) is even though you can't give the causal for bad p3do is inherently negative

(2:11:57) because it has a psychological damaging effect on children well if we can't even move into what bad is other than what is

(2:12:03) bad what is bad what if I use So how do you define that yeah so I'll use this well you're under the internal critique

(2:12:09) now i just defended my worldview now it's your turn so I will so moving on to your next What do you want me to define

(2:12:14) it then well you don't need you i mean I I guess you can try real quick if you

(2:12:19) want to do that on the social side or we can just move right into your feminist worldview of what is bad

(2:12:26) what would be the difference between a feminist well I'm trying to I'm trying to make the determination then if it is

(2:12:32) the case that all I have to do is prove to you that feminism has caused negative outcomes then you would concede that

(2:12:39) feminism is bad right but feminism hasn't caused negative outcomes but if I could demonstrate that it has then you

(2:12:45) would concede it was bad but it hasn't but if I could demonstrate that you would have to concede it's bad

(2:12:51) right but you can't but if I could you can't but if I could would it would you concede it was bad i want to hear your

(2:12:58) definition of what is bad though why why would my definition of bad have anything to do with what your definition of bad

() 

(2:13:04) throughout this entire debate you have been advocating against the free will and the bodily autonomy of a significant

(2:13:10) group of people you wanted Hold on you want to disenfranchise voters my whole view was already up for internal

(2:13:16) critique and I gave you the entire internal critique of my argument of force doctrine for an hour and a half

(2:13:23) and now it's my turn for the internal critique an internal critique of the argument of force doctrine for an hour and a half let's calm down uh what do

(2:13:29) you know what time it is yeah it's about to be 5:45 yeah so it was about an hour

(2:13:35) and a half so here's here's the thing right we get into feminism itself if I

(2:13:40) can demonstrate to you that the outcomes of feminism have been bad will you concede that it's bad if I could if you

(2:13:47) can demonstrate that the outcome of feminism is bad how would you under the force doctrine then that would be saying

(2:13:53) that to has nothing to do with my view you're now under internal critique i'm saying that under the force doctrine the

(2:13:59) only way to remove feminism would be through force if we can both agree that's not the only way to remove

(2:14:04) feminism really but I thought all power comes through force so So what how would

(2:14:09) you remove power from the fundamental building blocks of power would still be there but it would not be the only way

(2:14:15) to remove feminism so you believe that there are other ways to fundamentally have and consolidate power besides force

(2:14:20) well it's not just a matter of power though right so but that is this is this is the big problem like you don't even

(2:14:26) you don't even understand what's being said but here's the thing back to this uh on feminism do you agree with me that

(2:14:33) feminism has not kept its promise of protecting women

(2:14:41) um I think it's making progress i think it's done better but I don't think it's Well how how is it done better if we've

(2:14:48) had now about 150 years of feminism and women are in more dangerous situations

(2:14:54) they've ever been in the history of the United States why do you believe women are in more dangerous situations now well I'm sorry do you do you agree with

(2:15:00) all of the reign statistics on sexual assault and all these various things well sexual assault statistically has

(2:15:06) increased but again the amount of reporting has also increased and so has STDs before sexual assault so as so has

(2:15:12) STDs so men so have mental ill not as much as it does women and not as much hang not as much as mental Hang on i'm

(2:15:19) going to give you the laundry list mental illness much higher in women single motherhood much higher in women right divorce A much higher right all of

(2:15:26) the by every single conceivable uh metric for negative outcome you would

(2:15:31) have to concede that we've had nothing but negative outcomes from feminism the intact family home has been completely

(2:15:38) eliminated due to feminism that's not true yes it is true why are you conflating causation and correlation

(2:15:44) though okay i'm sorry is it feminist how are you feminist organizations that push

(2:15:50) for no fault divorce all over the United States sure yes yeah and I'm sorry but do you

(2:15:56) think that we have more or less intact families because of that okay but living in an unhappy home like why should

(2:16:03) people be subject to live in to live in sub What about the positive outcomes for children like even if it were the case

(2:16:08) that you didn't really like your husband but your children had better outcomes if you stayed with him shouldn't you your children will not have better outcomes

(2:16:14) if they did wouldn't you i personally would rather live in a family that is separated but both of my I know that's

(2:16:20) great what you would personally like to do but if it were the case that I think most children would though i mean if

(2:16:26) you're in if it were the case though okay but what if you're in if it were the case though that you were to be in a

() 

(2:16:31) relationship with a man you didn't particularly liked him but you stayed together and your children had better results because you stayed together

(2:16:38) right would you stay together with him that's my question yes but what if you're you're forgetting about but you're forgetting about abusive

(2:16:44) relationships you're forgetting about a relationship in which one parent is an addict you're forgetting about one parent and one parent is a cheater we'll

(2:16:51) go over those child would be significantly it would be significantly more beneficial to be removed from a

(2:16:56) I'll give you the stats there as well so as we dive into this understand that cohabitation between men and women is

(2:17:03) what leads to mostly abuse not marriage the marriage rates of abuse are very low in comparison to cohabitation

(2:17:09) cohabitation is the standardization which you see with divorce that's where most of the abuse comes from where it

(2:17:15) doesn't come from usually is from the husband in the home but you're saying that cohabitation is leading to abuse

(2:17:20) and marriage is cohabitation no no no cohabitation would be you're living with a man without being married to him okay

(2:17:27) okay so you think that they should marry but like that would be having a child out of wedlock which is yeah you don't need to have a child out of wedlock

(2:17:33) either you like these things are not mutually exclusive so if it is the case you have cohabitation it leads to more

(2:17:38) abuse the prescription for that for the less negative outcome would be marriage right no the prescription for that would be to separate those two people if

(2:17:44) cohabitation of two partners who are not married is leading to abuse then why should those people then get married

(2:17:50) yeah that doesn't make any sense okay no no no the fact that they're married and the fact that when you're married

(2:17:55) there's less abuse than when you cohabitate would point and indicate that cohabitation is a bad idea not that

(2:18:02) marriage is a bad idea no I think it would point and indicate that couples who cohabitate without being married

(2:18:08) it's better why should they get why should you get married to someone who you cannot even cohabitate with because

(2:18:14) abuse rates skyrocket when you cohabitate and are not married so those who are cohabitated in an abusive

(2:18:20) relationship once they get married you're claiming the cohabitation itself leads to more abuse

(2:18:26) okay so then why would the remedy of that be for those two people to get married because often times the

(2:18:32) cohabitation begins from divorce so you're saying that cohabitation what the [ __ ] does that

(2:18:38) even mean it means that post divorce women tend to cohabitate more especially when they have kids and it's the

(2:18:44) cohabitation with these people which leads to the abuse in their kids or the abuse of them so you're saying that they

(2:18:50) should stay in an unhappy relationship instead of only if we care about outcomes and you said if it is the case

(2:18:57) that I stayed with my man and the outcome for my kid was better you should probably do that so if it's the case

(2:19:02) that I can demonstrate for you that when women leave their husband the abuse rates for them and their kids skyrocket for cohabitation but what about

(2:19:09) the outcome for that man my turn i mean that's a net negative for two adults versus a net for a child here's what you

(2:19:16) said you said specifically if it is the case that I'm married and uh the results

(2:19:23) are better for my kids wait one second one second one second filibuster the debate hold on why is your mom calling

(2:19:29) you in the middle of a debate while she's doing that

(2:19:35) there we go hold on okay hold on hold on now chats come through pop champagne

(2:20:08) put it My nail is [ __ ] me up yes I do have a source for that if you would like it it's from the NIS anybody can find it

(2:20:15) i just cited all of the statistics on it yesterday uh oh

(2:20:20) come on you can do it put it Put it right side up just You can do it you got this all right bro i can't do it here

(2:20:25) all right oh my god uh you I guess Yeah

(2:24:01) i got one more chat coming through and let's try to bring it back to feminism avatar Avatar Gloavius donated $200

(2:24:11) that's a great question actually do you think misogyny is worse than Missandry if so why here's what we're going to do

(2:24:17) though yeah I like that question i mean I have a quick answer i think equally bad time is limited so we do uh have to

(2:24:24) kind of rapid fire through it so if you guys want to have a brief back and forth I don't I want to get back to the view i

(2:24:29) agree with that um no I don't think misogyny is worse than misinjury i think

(2:24:36) they are both equally bad i think that specifically I think that the point

(2:24:41) should be to create a society in which both sexes work together i will acknowledge that there are differences

(2:24:47) between men and women physiologically but at the same time I do think that mentally both groups are

(2:24:54) an inherent net positive on our society and I think that it is better if both groups work together and anyone who is

(2:25:00) willing to sew divisiveness between men and women I do not agree with by the way I just want to point out to the chat to

(2:25:06) go over to Jake's travel blog and watch as he couldn't [ __ ] a rifle and I had to literally grab it from him and [ __ ] this

(2:25:12) rifle cuz he couldn't do it just want to point that out he's salty in that

(2:25:21) yes the jar it's Indiana Wilson in the jar of doom uh is it would it be worth covering uh

(2:25:28) male privilege for example as it relates to feminism um wait i just wanted to really quickly say on the topic of

(2:25:36) cohabitation versus marriage in necessarily an unhappy home as we both

(2:25:42) agreed that ad feminism is the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of equality and equity of the sexes to be

() 

(2:25:50) able to promote that women can also get a divorce as well as men I don't think

(2:25:55) is advocating in favor of cohabitation and both can be true i don't think that those are mutually exclusive there's

(2:26:01) better topics to cover i think the problem with that is that we're using your metric for what is bad under your

(2:26:07) metric for what is bad is the negative outcomes there's negative outcomes with those relationships therefore they are bad i already told you that I'm not an

(2:26:14) inherent consequentialist yeah I know but every time I try to get a justification out of you you just went back to negative outcomes otherwise bad

(2:26:20) is bad is bad is bad is bad is bad okay but you can't really quantify the net negative outcome of something that doesn't happen actually I can quantify

(2:26:27) the negative net outcome i can look at what happens to the children who are abused i can give you the stats from the

(2:26:32) NIS i went over all of them yesterday right here on this very program with a different feminist debater so then what

(2:26:38) you're arguing is against cohabitation but not against the right to unless it's feminists who are doing everything they

(2:26:44) can in order to produce the outcomes for marriage and cohabitation

(2:26:50) i mean I don't know who you're talking to but I'm talking to reduce the outcomes against like you can say that

(2:26:57) cohabitation is bad but women still deserve a right to divorce a husband that is Okay well let's move on we'll

(2:27:02) move on to the next one i'm fine with that yeah and we'll do the final internal critique for the debates done what's the next topic Brian or do you

(2:27:09) want me to bring one up you have something you I mean we could cover uh differentials when it comes to privilege

(2:27:15) male privilege versus female privilege what's the question what's the Do you

(2:27:22) believe that uh there's Do you think male privilege exists

(2:27:27) yeah i mean and is it greater than female privilege i think that we all have inherent

(2:27:33) privileges and I think it's important to talk about intersectionality when we talk about privilege because Yeah but what's the question is asking

(2:27:39) specifically do you think that Andrew you don't let me finish my statement you want me to finish the statement because you don't know where I'm going with it

(2:27:45) yes or no do men have more privilege in society i think some men do yes but again like I would think that a disabled

() 

(2:27:52) man probably has less privilege than a able-bodied woman depending on what his

(2:27:58) disability is if we were to take all women and put them collective as a group and all men collective as a group would

(2:28:04) you say that men are more advantaged or have privileges over women or that women are privileged and have advantages over

(2:28:09) men yeah I would say collectively men probably have more privileges than men okay so now we understand exactly what it is

(2:28:15) that we're arguing so let me just start with this what about the draft what about the draft so how is it that men

(2:28:21) are privileged over women when men can be drafted women cannot well that wouldn't be an example of when women

(2:28:27) have a privilege over men i don't think the draft should apply to anyone though to be honest it does apply to men i know

(2:28:32) and I don't even think we should have a draft i think inherently immoral as well yeah but we do have a draft we do

(2:28:39) descriptively i know oh and and how could it be that men young men especially can be drafted at the age of

(2:28:44) 18 19 20 years old be sent to fight wars often on behalf of women who can vote them into those wars right how is that a

(2:28:51) privilege that men have and what is the if you had to pick anything that you could point to for women that is on par

(2:28:59) with that duty that men have i want to hear what it is i would say probably the societal role of the traditional wife

(2:29:06) and the inability for certain women or the promotion of an idea that women should not be allowed to work

(2:29:14) who promotes that women should not be allowed to work you do no I don't so you think that women should be allowed to

(2:29:19) work women have always been able to work and you think that outside of the home yeah of course they've always been able

(2:29:25) to work outside the home okay that's great what does that have to do with anything i mean part of the whole

(2:29:30) manosphere and like the promotion of these social norms and social rules that's where you're wrong you see really

(2:29:37) the the actually you have the more misogynistic view no but I'm you have the more misogynistic view the truth is

(2:29:44) is that what the manosphere would say is that a lot of them say "No those women need to [ __ ] work otherwise they're

(2:29:50) in a position of privilege being at home." So let me ask you this are women in a position of privilege podcasters oh

(2:29:56) you hear them say it all the time are women in a position of privilege saying that Gaines isn't saying that yeah they

(2:30:02) do but here's the thing i'll demonstrate it for you are women in a position of privilege when they're stay-at-home moms

(2:30:09) no are they in a position of privilege when they're working unless they I mean I think that they're in a position of

(2:30:16) equality or equity that's the goal but so then that would mean by that logic

(2:30:21) they're oppressed by being stay-at-home moms i think that if they are not using their free will to decide whether or not

(2:30:27) they're a stay at home mom yeah they're a stay-at-home mom okay are they privileged or not privileged is it a

(2:30:33) privilege to be a stay-at-home mom or is it not a privilege to be a stay-at-home mom or is it a privilege for women to

(2:30:38) work or is it not a privilege to work i think it depends circumstantially if a stay-at-home mom is choosing and has her

(2:30:44) free will to be a stay at home mom and that is an arrangement that she made with her husband who would also like to do that then it can be yes but if a

(2:30:52) woman does not have the right to make that choice and if you are you know proposing a society in which we follow

(2:30:58) strict gender rules and societal rules in which Yeah but gender gender norms

(2:31:04) show women always working always having worked yes the idea is gender norms what

(2:31:09) they don't show is that it's a good idea for women to take their reproductive years and work outside of the home

(2:31:15) that's stupid that makes no sense yes of course how do you establish yourself in a career if you like actively have a

(2:31:22) child at home you establish yourself in a career after your childbearing years like everybody else would so you have to

(2:31:28) start work at like 40 versus having children at 40 well you don't have you

(2:31:33) can do both though but here's the thing this is what's so funny establish a career do you think then that if you

(2:31:38) split moms split their attention between their children and their career that their children are going to get as much

(2:31:45) attention as they would if the mom didn't have a career but why should a mother not have the ability to have a

(2:31:51) career for their children well then just don't have children they would right exactly this is my point though right

(2:31:57) it's like so why would But women make up 47% of the labor force literally millions of women do this every day yeah

(2:32:04) and you know what happens our birth rate do you know what it's at it's a lot lower significantly why

(2:32:10) because women are having kids older but that's free will you can't just user

(2:32:16) someone's right to have free will because their job is so let me ask you is it a negative thing that the birth

(2:32:21) rate is declining to the point where we can't even sustain our population well we could if we allow immigrants to come

(2:32:26) in but wait wait wait so you want to replace the population no i'm not a replacement theorist but you want to

(2:32:32) replace the population can we go back no no no we can Can you answer the question if it is the case that our population is

(2:32:38) massively decreasing which you just conceded it is because women are having children older which you just conceded

(2:32:45) they are and you say that's a good thing and then say it wouldn't it wouldn't go down if we had immigrants come in how's

(2:32:51) that not replacing the population i'm not saying that's a good thing but I don't understand what your solution is should women not be allowed to work until it's your internal critique time

(2:32:58) now tell me will women not be allowed to work until they've had children why are you asking me questions of answering

() 

(2:33:04) them now it's my turn to ask the question so why is that because you just open you just internally critiqued and I

(2:33:11) allowed you for over an hour at least my position my turn so real quick can you

(2:33:17) tell me why it is that when you get to the point where you cannot replace your own population and you say "Well we

(2:33:24) wouldn't have a problem with that if we open it up to immigrants." How is that not you advocating for replacement i'm

(2:33:29) not advocating for complete replacement i'm not saying people should just stop working and stop having children and it should be entirely up to immigrants but

(2:33:36) I mean if we did have more channels for immigrants to come into this country legally you know we might not replace

(2:33:42) the domestic population what's the problem with doing that though don't all

(2:33:47) would it replace the domestic population it wouldn't completely replace it would it mostly replace it it would add why is

(2:33:54) it replace it's adding because if the people who are Okay let me add ask you this is it a good thing that Native

(2:34:00) Americans don't have a lot of kids why aren't they having kids well is it a

(2:34:05) good thing that they are or are not would you rather see Native Americans having more kids i mean I don't like Why

(2:34:12) is it a bad thing that we came over here and took land from the Native Americans and replaced their population why is

(2:34:18) that bad well because we killed millions of people and caused significant amount actually it was human suffering actually

(2:34:24) actually most hang on most of what killed is most of what killed Native Americans was not genocide it was

(2:34:31) disease the Trail of Tears killed millions of people okay that actually no the Trail of Tears didn't kill millions

(2:34:37) of people yes it did how many millions do you think died in the Trail of Tears let's Google it google it all right

(2:34:44) how many millions died at the Trail of Tears it says an estimated 4,000 out of 16,000

(2:34:52) Cherokee people or wait forced to relocate let me see deaths uh how many

(2:34:58) millions it says uh estimate estimate that 6,000 men women and children die on the 12,200

(2:35:05) mile march called the Trail of Tears Cherokee okay so is 6,000 anywhere close

(2:35:10) to millions let's just millions how many Native American people were killed from

(2:35:15) colonization can you Google that one for me yeah disease how many were killed by disease how many Native Americans killed

(2:35:23) by colonization it's a millions of people no disease

(2:35:28) killed them disease killed the overwhelming amount of Native Americans we used chemical warfare or not we Oh we

(2:35:35) did huh so we didn't understand anything about how diseases worked but we were able to use diseases for chemical

(2:35:40) warfare huh what do you mean we didn't understand how disease when do you think When do you think we understood the disease process you know that smallox

(2:35:47) blankets blankets that were infected with smallox given and gifted to not the

(2:35:53) [ __ ] it's not okay let me ask you a question is that a myth you get sick and you don't understand how the disease

(2:35:59) process works because science hasn't discovered it yet and then you hand a blanket that sick people have used to

(2:36:05) another person not understanding we back that one too Brian did you check it yes which one smallox first of all how many

(2:36:11) millions were check the smallox that one first in the uh in the United States and

(2:36:17) North America or the entire Americas actually if we didn't you're just goalpost shifting i mean but that's not

(2:36:24) true i said that you said millions of people died during the Trail of Tears okay stop lying all right then let's

(2:36:30) include all Holy [ __ ] stop lying and also check All you have to do is check the disease that Native Americans All

(2:36:36) you have to do is check the disease rates it was 80 to 90% of all natives died from diseases and by the way the

(2:36:42) smallox blankets the smallox blankets happened hundreds of years after colonization calm down the question that

(2:36:49) you ask smallox blankets happened hundreds of years postc colonization the question that you were asking let's fact

(2:36:55) check that but while you're doing that the question that you were asking is was the colonization of the Americas bad and

(2:37:03) I'm saying yes it was because it resulted in the deaths of millions of people got it so if the outcome and that

(2:37:11) would be a negative outcome right yes so if God why is my if Japan if Japan wants

(2:37:16) to keep itself Japanese is that negative for what purpose because they just want

(2:37:22) to be Japanese how are they doing that by not letting in any immigrants

(2:37:27) are immigrants coming into their country and are they detaining them in cages very very few are ever allowed to come

(2:37:33) in yes very few i mean if they're not physically hurting or endangering those

(2:37:38) people then I wouldn't say that's necessarily a negative but I think it depends on the outcome for the Japanese

(2:37:43) population so if the Japanese um if let's just say that they only wanted their domestic population to be Japanese

(2:37:49) there's nothing inherently wrong with that uh I don't know you don't know

(2:37:56) can I answer the question if there's a net negative that happens when the Japanese population

(2:38:02) selfisolates then I do think that there's something inherently wrong with that but I think it's hard to quantify how negative that is to that population

(2:38:09) so like if the Japanese were isolating themselves and their birth rate was decreasing you would consider that to be

(2:38:15) negative yes if they were losing population if they were losing a labor force because of selfisolation if people

(2:38:21) were starving and people could not make enough money because of Well they weren't just star they're not starving but they're just not reproducing if

(2:38:27) people aren't reproducing and they're incapable of reproduction or they're capable of it they're just not yeah i

(2:38:33) mean if it is hurting that population then I would say that's a net negative okay so then if white people aren't reproducing is that hurting their

(2:38:39) population it depends do they want to reproduce it seemingly seemingly the like primary

(2:38:47) edict is reproduction right okay sure okay so then if white people are not reproducing that's harmful to white

(2:38:53) people's population well if the primary edict is reproduction why aren't they reproducing well because they defer

(2:38:58) their what's happened is there has been a massive campaign to defer all women's childbearing years for college years

(2:39:05) this is in every industrial country we look at so what are you structurally asking i'm asking you this question i'm

(2:39:11) asking you is it inherently bad that white people aren't reproducing

(2:39:17) no if they So is it inherently bad like you just said that the Japanese people aren't reproducing

(2:39:23) i guess no if they're in their free will but what the [ __ ] how is it bad if the

(2:39:28) Japanese don't reproduce but it's it's it it's bad if they don't but it's not bad if white people don't no I'm not

(2:39:35) saying it's bad if either group does what I'm saying is it depends on the effects to that population and why

(2:39:40) they're not reproducing if they're not reproducing as an exercise of free will and they are happier without reproducing

(2:39:47) then why is that negative so if we were to look at like the mental health outcomes of women who reproduce versus those who didn't which which group would

(2:39:54) you say would be be happier um I'm not sure which group do you say

(2:40:00) would be happier well statistically which group is happier what the group that's statistically happier are women who reproduce and have children okay but

(2:40:06) again that's the whole causation correlation thing and it feels like the thing is is like everything you can say

(2:40:12) is a causation right we look for the primary causation for what is the correlation we even do this with things

(2:40:17) like drinking and driving right so I could always say no it just correlates that drinking in your car leads to more

(2:40:24) accidents right but if it is the case that that's the primary correlate then we tend to say it's because drinking and

(2:40:30) driving these accidents increase that's how you would do it hang on so if that's the case I'm just asking you again the

(2:40:37) question right when you say it's just correlation causation if the primary correlation is that they're having

(2:40:43) children and that's what makes them happier and that women who don't have children are less happy then wouldn't

(2:40:48) you say that's a negative outcome yes I would say that's a negative but I do just want to ask so let's say that

(2:40:55) that is a negative outcome what is your solution do you think women should not be allowed to go to college do you think

() 

(2:41:01) women should I would just advocate for a national campaign which asks women to keep the the traditional family intact

(2:41:07) because it's going to lead to the most amount of children and to defer those college age years just like we did a

(2:41:13) national campaign to try to move women into college I would do a national campaign to say defer those years for

(2:41:19) childbearing and you can always go to college later after your kids are grown or you can do it from home well that's not fun that's not the point of college

(2:41:25) did you go to college the point of college is to go [ __ ] no what's the point the point of college is to learn

(2:41:30) while you are young so that you can gain skills that help you in the workforce and develop a career over time it takes

(2:41:35) time to develop a career you can you can develop the first of all most of the people are getting degrees by the way

(2:41:42) they ain't using those [ __ ] degrees in any of those fields are they what's your degree gonna be in

(2:41:47) what's it gonna be in [ __ ] your mom no I'm joking film production and do you think that you're going to end up a film

(2:41:52) producer hopefully that's But I mean do you think that the chances that most people have a degree in film production

(2:41:58) are producing film i mean I happen to go to the best film school in the country but you know yeah just like I just had a

(2:42:04) woman I talked to yesterday who got a degree in comedy writing oh well sorry

(2:42:10) yeah yeah or psychology or sociology these degree these fields are completely oversaturated these skills are still

(2:42:17) useful and we also know but we also okay but we also know that people on average

(2:42:22) who get a college degree the median income for those people is higher yeah but guess what the negative effects

(2:42:28) mentally much higher than if they don't have children they're college educated so your plan is to usurp people's free

(2:42:33) will how are you usurping it by having a campaign just asking people to defer okay and then if they choose not to do

(2:42:39) that what happens they can choose but here's the thing it was extraordinarily fun it was extraordinarily effective to

(2:42:46) have the propaganda which said that women should be going to college if you look at the college rates pre the

(2:42:52) propaganda post it right you can see that it had a great effect you could have the same type of effect which which

(2:42:58) asked women to defer that after childbearing years because they're happier well more well adjusted and

(2:43:03) guess what you would be promoting then the the old school gender roles women

(2:43:08) fought an entire I mean not fought physically but women had several many

(2:43:14) movements on the basis of demanding the right to choose whether or not they go to college and when why would we do that

(2:43:20) if we didn't want Are you saying that the feminist revolution is a proper movement when it came to college it was

(2:43:25) I mean there's currently more women in college than it didn't want to be here so when it came to college there was

(2:43:30) very few there was these Ivy League colleges there was very few colleges ever and most men never went to college either that's the truth almost nobody

(2:43:37) ever went to college it was about uh the best and the brightest and what's happened is we've lowered the deviated

(2:43:42) standards so anybody can [ __ ] go to college now it's become a requirement for an entry-level job to go to college

(2:43:48) which is insane but that's an issue with capitalism it's not an issue with capitalism it's an issue with stupid

(2:43:54) feminist propaganda just a moment just a moment uh I need to uh do a quick

(2:43:59) sidebar with both of you really quick so uh viewers we're going to take a 20 30 second intermission just stay tuned hold

(2:44:06) on for just a moment what' we do oh no you guys didn't do anything one moment guys

(2:45:20) i'm going to let some I'm going to let some chats come through um while we're doing that we're just seeing if we're going to be able to uh increase the

(2:45:28) length of the debate for just a bit here since we are closing in on the end here we have Pasty George with message hey

(2:45:34) Pasty thank you pasty George donated $200 thank you ultimately feminism had

(2:45:40) to rely on men physical force even to open my argument is that men rely on physical force of men too so a man who's

(2:45:48) stronger than you from removing your physical force why is he nothing that's what force doctrine is like you still

(2:45:55) don't get it uh last call if you want to get the message in $200 TTS pull it up streamlabs

(2:46:00) that doesn't like why are the leaders not why are our leaders not the strongest people in the world one more if you guys pay attention george donated

(2:46:06) $200 thank you Pasty George it's estimated that approximately 90% of the indigenous population in the Americas or

() 

(2:46:14) about 55 million people died during the colonization period cont continued

(2:46:20) continued yeah do we want to see the rest how do we Yeah it's it's going to come in just 10 seconds pasty George

(2:46:26) thank you for the message if you guys want to get your own message here as we uh are getting ready to wrap up the stream streamllights.com/ whatever $200

(2:46:33) TS get them in pasty George donated $200

(2:46:38) this drastic population decline is attributed to a combination of factors including disease disment and violence

(2:46:46) in Canada a similar pattern of population decline occurred so it is true that violence and forced

(2:46:53) displacement did kill a lot of Native Americans i'm not disputing that i'm what I am saying though is that disease

(2:46:58) killed the overwhelming amount of the native population by the way did we ever get the results on whether or not small

(2:47:05) pox the small pox blankets i don't if he's not going to answer we are going to

(2:47:10) drive up to Northern Cali so I probably can't stay if I'm being honest well just

(2:47:16) keep an eye on your phone and if he gives you an answer he gives you an answer we'll do uh in in that case

(2:47:21) here's what we're going to do oh Mary can I have you uh hold on I'll send you a private chat mary give us a moment

(2:47:26) guys while we're just figuring out a few things here

(2:47:35) one sec i need to bring it back to intro i don't know

(2:47:53) okay keep us posted on that yeah he's on DND i mean what do you want to do if he doesn't respond by 6:30

(2:48:03) uh why don't we just do this uh why don't you guys give your closing statements and time permitting will

(2:48:09) allow for like a little uh little overtime okay we'll just do that so uh

(2:48:14) Andrew are you going or I get to go last i open first so you go you give your uh closing statement up to five minutes

(2:48:21) then Andrew will give his go ahead okay hold on wait i put it back here take your time

(2:48:26) okay so um there were a lot of statements made today some of them I do agree with some of them I don't um and I

(2:48:34) do think that there is a difference between what we can do in terms of the force doctrine and what we ought to do i

() 

(2:48:40) think my goal society is to advance us towards a mutually beneficial society

(2:48:48) and I think that a lot of the arguments made are not only negative towards men

(2:48:53) but women as well so socially and I think that there are three differences

(2:49:00) three negative impacts of kind of hating on the goal of equality and they're

(2:49:06) social economic and political so socially it's fair to state that people

(2:49:12) are generally happier when they have free will and that it is although we cannot agree on a definition of free

(2:49:17) will it is inherently better to have a society in which all of us have a basic

(2:49:25) capacity for will over their body and bodily autonomy i think that a lot of

(2:49:30) the we didn't really talk that much about feminism if I'm being honest my closing statement is mostly about that

(2:49:36) but I guess what I'll say is that everyone deserves a right to free will without judgment and that goes for men

(2:49:42) as well as women i think that a lot of the idea that men have to maintain force

(2:49:47) over others and that if they don't do that they are emasculating themselves is inherently stifling to young men i think

(2:49:54) it's negative to young men i think it encourages aggression against each other and against women and I would argue that

(2:50:02) the equal force doctrine is inherently immoral it is immoral to police and dictate society exclusively on the basis

(2:50:10) of force if that was the case then all of our presidents would be the president because they want to freaking arm wrestle i think economically women do

(2:50:18) make up 47% of the labor force like it or not women add trillions of dollars to

(2:50:24) the GDP alongside men every year if we were to have women just step away from

(2:50:30) working and exclusively run the household we

(2:50:35) would be economically handicapping our own society and in terms of men the wage

(2:50:43) stagnation for the middle class which we didn't even get into um there's been incredible amounts of wage stagnation

(2:50:48) for middle class and lower income workers according to Pew Research after adjusting for inflation middle- class

(2:50:54) and lower income workers are making about the same now as they did in 1978 they have the same spending power

(2:51:00) however the cost of housing and living has gone up dramatically from 1970 the

(2:51:05) median home price was $23,000 which accounting for inflation is about $180,000 to today and in 2025 the median

(2:51:14) home price in quarter 1 of this year was $416,000 so it's almost three times as

(2:51:21) high as it was in 1978 so the a and the average cost of raising a child is around $21,000 a year

(2:51:28) in the US of course that depends on where you are but that's the national average i think if it is entirely up to

(2:51:35) men to put the and it puts the burden entirely on men to financially

(2:51:40) compensate for their household you know you're kind of disenfranchising them on a level as well

(2:51:46) i think the economic standard you're trying to hold men to is impossible and unfair and I don't think that you've had

(2:51:51) to live it because you're not the age of most men who are starting a family and

(2:51:58) who are starting work and who are starting to carry the financial burden of a society in which they are the sole

(2:52:03) providers for their household and then again money is power and if women don't have the ability to make money then they

(2:52:09) don't have the power to dictate what they do with themselves and they don't have the power to get basic resources

(2:52:15) for their children like food and water and lights and housing and then

(2:52:21) politically I think this one got kind of messy because Andrew doesn't seem to

(2:52:27) believe in basic representation for either men or women but I believe in a

(2:52:32) representative government i think that it is fundamentally illogical and practically impossible to create a

(2:52:38) government that is not based on the representation of all people i just think that's immoral and maybe I can't

(2:52:44) answer why that is but I think we a lot of people agree that they would like to the right to vote and just because you

(2:52:50) are stupid does not deny you the right to vote but despite being slightly more than

(2:52:56) half of the US population women have yet to make up 30% of the government in

(2:53:03) history the total number of female Supreme Court justices is six out of 116

(2:53:09) that's like 5% and I just don't think you can claim to have a representative democracy if it

(2:53:14) has never accurately represented the population but it doesn't sound like Andrew wants a representative democracy

(2:53:20) anyway so I guess that's besides the point but in closing I think that it's

(2:53:25) important to note that you literally cannot have a society of men or only

(2:53:30) women we actively just have to work together there's nothing we can do to avoid having to live and work together

(2:53:36) and I think that by hurting Thank you oh oh you're talking you're good you're good sorry how much time do I have left

(2:53:43) uh well uh Andrew will give his closing statement so you can sure take your time

(2:53:49) though to finish up yeah but anyway I think that enforcing stringent gender norms and I think that enforcing strict

(2:53:55) gender roles and I think that encouraging people to fall into those roles if that's not how they would like to exercise their free will is inherently immoral i do it fundamentally

(2:54:02) is to force people to do things that they do not want to do is an immoral act and it hurts both men and women because

(2:54:10) we fundamentally cannot exist without each other we are the same species and I don't know we just got to make it work

(2:54:19) all good yep okay i know did you hear you want to just check your phone see if you heard from him all right andrew

(2:54:25) would you like to give your closing statement yeah so my opponent

(2:54:30) um this debate was particularly annoying because she just literally has no idea

(2:54:35) what she's talking about she contradicted herself multiple times she conceded the force doctrine she said that there was millions of people died

(2:54:41) on the trail of tears just to name a few crazy ass things that she said when I she uh did a question begging fallacy

(2:54:48) which then moved on into another contradiction when we went into what actually even makes a thing bad she

(2:54:54) couldn't decide on what even her ethical purview was in which she was holding feminism to the standard of an ethical

(2:54:59) purview we couldn't even get past a lot of that so then we move into feminism itself she ends up conceding to most of

(2:55:06) my points there as well that she says that if the Japanese if their birth rate went down that would be bad by her

(2:55:11) standard white people wouldn't be bad but then she contradicted that as well it was just one contradiction after

(2:55:17) another in fact I would say out of all the opponents I've ever had this particular one contradicted herself more

(2:55:23) than maybe any other I've ever dealt with when I go back through it and we clip it up I got a feeling that it's

(2:55:29) just going to be like 800 contradictions um she the other thing to

(2:55:36) focus on too is that she conceded altogether force doctrine she ended up uh at the very end uh explaining that

(2:55:43) she not only agreed that it's descriptively true but that men have no obligation whatsoever to utilize force

(2:55:49) on behalf of women there's no moral ought for them to do that which is exactly what force doctrine dictates so

(2:55:55) she she made a complete concession on that as well um she says that hating on

(2:56:00) equality is stupid but we started to kind of dive into this we weren't able to get to it but uh bit bit on college

(2:56:08) when she conceded to the point that the standards have been lowered to the point where now a degree is necessary to get a

(2:56:13) job you can see this with DEI across the board it's it's not an empowerment of anybody it's a lowering of standards

(2:56:20) which hurts everybody and that's actually what's been going on in society for a long time is the lowering of

(2:56:26) standards that includes with college right she concedes that most of the population is stupid that was what she

(2:56:32) said she said "You're right most most people are stupid yet she she I don't think she would say most women who go to

(2:56:38) college are stupid which is interesting isn't it right most population stupid most women who go to college are not but

(2:56:45) if you agree that most population is stupid then mo you would probably have to concede that most of the population goes to college is also stupid which

(2:56:52) means the standards have been lowered there so that they can pass college right uh she says 47% of the labor force

(2:56:59) are women and then she acts like that's a choice right she's like "No women are empowered because they they have the

(2:57:04) choice to do that." It's like "No they don't actually have the choice to be stay-at-home moms in two income economy

(2:57:10) anymore." And that is taking choice away from women that's not empowering anybody

(2:57:17) and if you look at the mental health crisis of women it's almost always related to their obligations at work and

(2:57:24) family where if they could just focus on one or the other those mental health issues tend to deteriorate on basically

(2:57:30) every single point my opponent lost it was wild to see but she mostly lost

(2:57:35) because I was willing to stand up to the internal critique of my view of force

(2:57:41) doctrine and still got the concession out of her on what force doctrine was and the application of it um and then on

(2:57:49) top of that every subsequent point uh I basically got a concession out of so I

(2:57:54) don't really know how much more I could have won this particular debate but I do appreciate having it you want to keep

(2:58:01) going uh did you hear back from No I didn't but let's just do it how long yeah I'll

(2:58:08) do the 30 okay uh here so let's do this we'll do overtime but first we have a quick moment well then why did we just

(2:58:14) do closings well we were That's why I said we'll do closing and then there's

(2:58:19) here pickle jars please all right guys so uh we have pickle jars for each of you why doesn't someone have to pay an

(2:58:25) additional thousand dollar for me to open it how do you know they didn't well cuz it said it on it says that doesn't

(2:58:30) mean he shows every single All right just go ahead and uh give it and we've given you uh if you need to wipe it down

(2:58:36) or whatever i can't do this with my nails on but okay

(2:58:41) all right i didn't get it give it another Come on no got to tap it you got to tap it all right let's see

(2:58:48) do it on the table if you can oh oh [ __ ] wait put it on the table put

(2:58:54) it on the table ripping the [ __ ] uhoh

(2:58:59) oh I got myself oh no there we go okay just got to be on the [ __ ] thing you

(2:59:05) uh you undersold yourself a little bit you undersold yourself that wasn't that hard all right take them off the table

(2:59:11) please uh well done i got myself really messy well done to both of you um I do

(2:59:16) just want to go back to some of the claims you made in your closing um I'm not really interested in debating my

(2:59:21) closing no I'm not debating your closing let's focus on feminism though so bring it to feminism i mean it's all all of

(2:59:27) this is feminism though i think that part of the issue is that you seem to have this inherent need to Why do you

() 

(2:59:33) say inherent so much doesn't make you sound smarter are you going to let me finish i Well I

(2:59:39) just I'm really actually wondering why do you say inherent so much because you've argued this point on several many

(2:59:45) claims you seem to have an inherent need to limit the free will of others you say you don't want more people to vote you

(2:59:51) say you don't want women to go to college you say you don't want women to be in the workforce everything is about

(2:59:56) limiting the free will of both men and women on a certain point when it comes

(3:00:02) to um the concessions I agree that I did concede on a few points but I think that

(3:00:08) that's healthy to admit when you know your opponent makes a valid argument however I will say in terms of your

(3:00:15) argument out of both your desire for less people to vote out of your belief

(3:00:20) that stupid people should be somehow prevented from voting and out of your beliefs on feminism you don't actually

(3:00:25) promote a practical application of those beliefs what does that mean what's impractical about any of the

(3:00:31) applications of my beliefs it's impractical to create an IQ test for people to be then paid to do unpaid

(3:00:39) labor that's volunteer-based but you're paying for their housing in order to allow Do you agree that you can have

(3:00:45) like 50 different options for how you can uh limit the idea that uninformed

(3:00:51) voters can go after informed voters who's creating those options are you creating Can I Can I finish the answer

(3:00:56) no just let me know no you can do it i'm joking yeah yeah so if you can see that

(3:01:02) you can have like 50 different ways in which you can skin the cat right some of those ideas you may bring up valid

(3:01:08) points against them and say "Okay well perhaps that's not practical but like here's a practical application if you limited voting to the age of 35 what's

(3:01:14) impractical about it?" It's impractical because half of all of the population that's under 35 would be subject to laws

(3:01:22) that they have no say so what see so that's what I'm saying all that doesn't tell me how it's impractical what's

(3:01:28) impractical about it not necess It's impractical because millions of people

(3:01:34) would not be able What are you doing i'm trying to figure out where we get to the impractical part what's impractical

(3:01:41) you're just giving me more descriptors millions of people won't be able to do something yes millions of people right now can't kill people is that's

(3:01:47) impractical it's like what makes it impractical because throughout human history people have fought for the right

(3:01:52) of self-determination it is clearly a right that here we not all throughout

(3:01:58) human history what are you talking about that's one example we fought a war about it the British fought a war about it the Haitians have fought a war about it lord

(3:02:05) so you're talking about fought that's not all throughout history it is entirely that's one block of history

() 

(3:02:11) modern history hol what does that have to do with anything what are you talking about

(3:02:17) world War II was founded on a belief that people should not be killed that

(3:02:22) was a fight in terms of free will that was a fight for the free will war II was founded on the belief that people should

(3:02:29) not be killed nazi the Nazi party and Hitler was trying to limit the free will of others yes or no no they weren't no

(3:02:37) at the beginning of the war you don't think that taking over other people's countries and territories is limiting

(3:02:42) their free will as a country no you're talking about practical applications when you're talking about

(3:02:48) like the beginning of the war you're talking about the Treaty of Versailles the tree of Versailles to led to western

(3:02:54) and eastern Germany being divided by the war powers the war powers when they divided them it created all sorts of

(3:03:00) conflict in Germany hitler began off of a a campaign for unification of eastern

(3:03:06) and western Germany okay and then he actually you would make be making the point that because there was conflict in

(3:03:12) the first world war which led to the treaty of Versailles that Germany got [ __ ] that's what you would be arguing but then he went on to invade several

(3:03:18) many countries which he went on to invade yeah yeah he went on to invade Poland about hatred and we went on to invade Germany like what's your point so

(3:03:26) did the Russians exactly all of these fights are about sovereignty and free will and self-determination all of them

(3:03:33) no not all these fights are about free will and sovereignty and self-determination some of them are about exploitation some of them are

(3:03:39) about wanting land some of them are about money some of them are about expansionary considerations it is the denial of someone's free will that is

(3:03:45) what that is no they're not all these fights are not about free will you'd have to demonstrate that how is every fight about free will not every single

(3:03:53) fight well then what the he What are you talking about thousands of fights throughout human history people have

(3:03:58) fought throughout human history for their free will most people never fought in human history for the purposes of

(3:04:04) freedom or free will or anything else yes they have i'll tell you what give me the examples before the 20th century in

(3:04:11) fact let's start let's do it easy before the year 1700 name a single place on

(3:04:17) earth that was fighting for free will um the feudal system we can talk about the

(3:04:22) invasion of France the feudal system was fighting for free will no I'm saying those who fought against the monarchies

(3:04:27) and the overthrow of so many queens and kings the people fighting against monarchies were people who wanted to be

(3:04:33) the monarch not entirely if you were fighting against a monarchy that is usurping Waiting for an example give me

(3:04:39) an example i'm waiting if you are fighting against a monarchy that is usurping your free will you are fighting against free will but what I'm saying is

(3:04:46) consistently throughout this debate you have advocated against the free will and the sovereignty of other people and I

(3:04:52) think that that is inherently divisive it's inherently wrong why are you doing that yeah so this would be the same

(3:04:58) exact answer for why it is that tribalism I would want to divide tribalism because I don't like tribalism

(3:05:04) so I would want actually want it divided into larger blocks that tribalism went down bigger tribalism i don't know well

(3:05:10) you would actually at least um have some sort of sort of voting block that made sense that wasn't completely decadent on

(3:05:18) social programs where all of us had to tribalize together to build these blocks try to fight against everybody else a

(3:05:23) terrible idea always has been you conceded that it is you keep on saying I'm fighting against free will but I

(3:05:28) don't think that a representative you keep on saying that I keep fighting against free will that sounds like a two party you haven't actually demonstrated

(3:05:35) for me we don't listen you're talking about a national system is too party localized systems are not that way

(3:05:40) andrew you literally said that free will is a privilege that people do not deserve you literally said that when

(3:05:46) when did I say that people didn't deserve free will when we were talking about the equal force auction you don't

(3:05:51) even understand what I'm saying to you so we'll try this again understand what you're saying what you're saying to me is immoral and wrong let me show you if

(3:05:57) it's immoral and wrong tell me what makes limiting free will immoral you are

(3:06:03) hurting other people you are causing them pain and you were inflicting a net benefit net negative on society so what

(3:06:09) makes what makes that bad though it makes it bad because you are causing

() 

(3:06:15) someone pain how do you not agree with me that causing someone pain is bad like how are you not understanding that

(3:06:20) causing causing people pain is bad why because causing them pain is bad yeah but why is that increasing human suffering you are increasing human

(3:06:26) suffering yeah but you haven't you haven't told me why that's a problem so you think that increasing human

(3:06:32) suffering is moral do you understand that if I ask you a question you haven't told me why Butterfingers taste good and you're like "So you're saying

(3:06:37) Butterfingers taste bad makes no [ __ ] sense." You think that increasing human suffering is moral no I don't but I have

(3:06:45) I have epistemic justification for that why do you think it's bad why because

(3:06:50) you're increasing human suffering that doesn't tell me why it's bad you're fracturing society to like you're

(3:06:55) talking about you don't like tribalism but yet people need to usurp their right to exist based on force

(3:07:02) that's as tribalistic as it gets their right to exist based on force

(3:07:07) so then force doctrine is true right by your definition force so I just want to

(3:07:14) make sure I got this right i'm just agreeing with your definition so when we start with what it is if this thing is bad because it's bad because it's bad

(3:07:21) then let me try this limiting democracy is good because it's good because it's

(3:07:27) good ask me why it's good why do you think limiting democracy is good because it's good but that's not what I said i

(3:07:33) gave you multiple reasons as to why oh I think it's good because it reduces tribalism i think it's good because it

(3:07:39) reduces tribalism and it actually voters then would have some sort of responsibility and we we I think there's

(3:07:45) all sorts of perks which I've named for systems of limited even monarchies I think would be better than unfettered

(3:07:50) democracy you're advocating for a monarchy i think it would be better than a democracy are you joking oh no not at all are you crazy no what i'm sorry so

(3:07:58) you are trying to limit people's free will under a monarchy you systematically have less free will says who you are not

(3:08:03) being represented by your government why is that bad because they're not acting in your interest and in the interest of

(3:08:09) the general i don't think Oh so my government's acting in my interest go ahead and tell me lie to me my

(3:08:14) government's acting in my interest well we've talked about NGOs is my government acting in my interest

(3:08:20) we would hope that it would that's the point representative is it is my government acting in my interest i agree that this democracy is Can you answer my

(3:08:26) question is my government acting in my interest sometimes when when it's not

(3:08:32) being a corrupt piece of [ __ ] yeah when what is it doing that's acting in my interest i mean by establishing laws

(3:08:38) that maintain So force doctrine it acts in my interest by using force doctrine that's not force doctrine

(3:08:44) establishing law a monarchy also can provide security of law using force doctrine what are you talking a

(3:08:50) representative democracy you haven't demonstrated why a representative democracy is the ultimate good because why should you yield to a law that you

(3:08:57) have literally 0% say in who makes the law and what the law is

(3:09:02) again right now there's all kinds of people who make laws that I must obey that I had no participation in

(3:09:09) whatsoever true or false what laws so you don't vote no even if I voted that's

(3:09:14) the participation so if I go to [ __ ] Indiana am I subject to Indiana law yes did I vote in any of them no then that

(3:09:22) made then your whole entire argument just fell apart if it is the case that

(3:09:27) people can make law which I am subject to all over the world which they do including my own nation which they do

() 

(3:09:33) even in a local municipality right next door to mine which they do and I have to adhere to them and can't vote in it you

(3:09:39) have to say that that's immoral but if you become a legal citizen of Indiana then yes you can if you become a permanent resident of Indiana yes you

(3:09:45) can okay great if you become part of the aris aris aris ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar aristocratic like uh

(3:09:50) [ __ ] hierarchy you can but why should you get to go on vacation and then vote in that place and then leave that's the

(3:09:55) point if you are a permanent resident if you're saying if you go to Indiana you'll be dictated to those laws yes but

(3:10:01) you're not a permanent resident that's why you participate yeah you're just giving me descriptor problem with you is

(3:10:07) like you keep saying a representative democracy where everybody has this an equal say in law is the best system

(3:10:12) because otherwise you're limiting their cognitive ability to have free will and it's like okay but most laws you have no

(3:10:19) participation in which you follow almost all of them in fact you're following laws right now that were made before you

(3:10:24) were even [ __ ] born most of them in fact you're following that which were made before you were even

(3:10:30) born you had to zero participation I don't think that which

(3:10:36) is why people fought for the right to vote i don't think if one man has uh the right to make laws that he has less

(3:10:44) responsibility to his kingdom than you the voter did because some laws were made before I was born almost all of

(3:10:50) them not almost all almost all laws which you follow were made before you were born new laws are made every year

(3:10:55) what's my claim though my claim isn't whether or not new laws are made every year but whether or not most of the laws which you follow on this planet were

(3:11:02) made before you were even born how do you justify a monarchy though that doesn't make any sense so because I follow laws that people listen to you

(3:11:09) have not even justified yet why a democracy is good it all you say is

(3:11:14) because we have more participation rights in law and and that and by not doing that we we're limited somehow but

(3:11:21) it's like most of the laws you follow you never participated in it is limiting to not be able to actively participate

(3:11:28) in laws that you consistently you don't even have political power right now you

(3:11:34) have to bank on tribalism for political power because you have zero so then why would removing millions of voters give

(3:11:41) me and others sorry because you have the ability to hold those voters accountable

(3:11:47) like you would a monarch that's why but I can currently hold my

(3:11:52) Congress people accountable through my vote no you can't how do you hold a monarch accountable Andrew when you hold

(3:11:58) a monarch account if you think accountability is they can do whatever the [ __ ] they want leave multi-millionaires and you just voted

(3:12:04) them out of office great i don't consider that accountability how are you holding a monarch accountable well a monarch would be overthrown for having

(3:12:11) unjust laws so then why would you system in which the only way to overthrow the

(3:12:16) powers that be is through violence if a monarch gets overthrown they get killed it sounds like you're moving us backwards why are you advocating for

(3:12:23) more violence aren't you How is that an advocation of more violence you said you want a monarchy you said that the way in

(3:12:29) which to control a monarch is democracy democracy has not prevented social violence at all in fact it has increased

(3:12:36) it are you trying to tell me that in the last decade democracy has saved us from

() 

(3:12:41) political violence are you [ __ ] serious no of course not the monarchy is not going to save us from political

(3:12:48) violence oh hey people are really mad about the right that they don't have free choice let's give them less what

(3:12:54) i'm not I'm not even advocating for a monarchy only telling you that you have not justified why a monarch would be

(3:13:00) worse than unfettered democracy and you haven't justified that I have with limited democracy I've shown you all the

(3:13:06) benefits for reducing tribalism the NOS's all the things that you hate under your current

(3:13:12) current in a limited democracy under your current because you can hold the voters who are in the limited democracy

(3:13:18) responsible you publicize their names and their votes you want to dox voters [ __ ] yeah What the [ __ ] is wrong with

(3:13:24) you i'm sorry you don't want to know who votes in your interest but you're like encouraging violence against those

(3:13:31) people they're going to be harassed i guess they better [ __ ] vote right i literally just signed a document saying I couldn't dox the studio why can't I

(3:13:37) dox the studio you're entering a private contract is Brian representing you in government no would you would you ever

(3:13:43) Hang on would you ever elect a politician who was anonymous but that's how we know who the legislators are not

(3:13:48) the voters themselves again I want to hold both of them accountable both

(3:13:54) that sounds like you're increasing the amount of violence against those people how is that increasing violence because if someone votes in a way that I do not

(3:14:00) disagree with and I'm a crazy [ __ ] I can go and shoot them it's opening so many people up to

(3:14:06) vulnerability you can do it right now if they're like this is real quick just real quick

(3:14:13) so real quick right now aren't there millions of people who publicize who they voted for how come they're not

(3:14:19) getting shot because it's their choice and they would still be their choice we all have the right to vote though Lord

(3:14:26) why would that make a difference the right to vote then we can't get mad at people actually if it is the case that you thought that political violence

(3:14:32) would increase based on how many more people have the right to vote or less people have the right to vote if more people came out saying they voted for

(3:14:38) the political candidate you don't like you should see an increase in political violence and you don't but if only a few

(3:14:44) people have the right to vote and if our politicians okay but they're elected

(3:14:50) again they're still elected officials if we're talking about the right to vote not the right to be a politician if only

(3:14:55) a few people have the right to vote and the rest of us are all disenfranchised and we see that that person votes

(3:15:00) against our interest and we have absolutely no other way to control them what do you think is going to happen to

(3:15:06) those people the same thing that would happen right now what would be the distinction if you came out and said "I

(3:15:11) voted for Kla Harris and you're not getting shot now." Why would you be shot later because now millions of people

(3:15:16) don't have the right to make that choice they're going to be mad about it millions of people don't make the choice now you don't think millions of people

(3:15:22) millions of people don't make the choice now and not only that what here's what happens here's your great benefit millions of people do i'm going to explain the great benefit that you have

(3:15:28) if you have it set that way for voters right where you have a voting class which is at least somewhat elite based

(3:15:34) on the idea that they were infranchised the proper way even if it's just at 35 what you do is you reduce the fact that

(3:15:41) the NGO and the lobbyists can bribe that electorate group especially if it's

(3:15:46) public if they be they can't approach voters they can't do things like that you eliminate that problem but those

(3:15:52) things are public for legislators now and we still haven't no they're not because what happens is they bribe the electorate they bribed the electorate

(3:15:59) through uh drafting NGO legislation for the voters trump just took a million and

(3:16:05) upon million he took a $400 million bribe from the Saudis no he didn't yes he did no he didn't the plane what plane

(3:16:12) he just got a private jet donated to him i got to let the chat come in i got to let this chat come in from Glockavius

(3:16:19) avatar Glavius donated $200 for you nima what would you say are your top three

(3:16:26) takes that would trigger Andrew oh also can women be sexist towards men can

(3:16:31) black people be racist towards white people let's do this answer the two questions at the end then come back to

(3:16:37) the the Okay um I think that there are different types of sexism and different

(3:16:42) types of racism so in terms of I actually have the definitions of some of the types of sexism here I'll pull them

(3:16:48) up um no I got you i got you very quickly while you're looking at that I'm going to let this pasty george donated $200

() 

(3:16:56) thank you PY appreciate it disease was a significant contributing factor in the decline of the indigenous people's

(3:17:02) population it was the primary cause the infected blankets were minor in correct thank you

(3:17:09) Pasty um okay so can women go back to the question can women be sexist towards men can black people be racist towards

(3:17:15) white people okay yeah so there's actually multiple types of sexism and racism there's hostile sexism benevolent

(3:17:22) systemic interpersonal internalized and ambivalent now I think that women can be

(3:17:28) all of those except for systemic and institutional institutionally if you don't have power as in you are not the

(3:17:36) vast majority in a government and you are not actually trying to remove others from institutional power then you can't

(3:17:42) do that especially if you don't have the power to but isn't wait let's let's just get through the whole thing okay but I

(3:17:48) think that you can be hostile towards men on the basis that they are men and that would be hostile racism and I think

(3:17:54) that you could be interpersonally sexist towards men on the basis that they are men and I also think you can have

(3:18:00) internalized sexist beliefs about men and then what about can black people be racist towards white people would it be

(3:18:05) the same basically the same and then uh it seemed like Andrew wanted to bite on that really quick but for the top three

(3:18:11) takes that would trigger Andrew Wilson what would they be um top three takes that would trigger

(3:18:18) Andrew Wilson i don't know humans deserve free will I guess i didn't even think that was a triggering i thought

(3:18:23) that was a universally two others if you have any um

(3:18:29) honestly I kind of like trolling Andrew and like trying to piss him off because I think he tries to do that to a lot of

(3:18:35) his guests and I'm sure that that is annoying but you know it is what it is

(3:18:40) well let me know when you succeed at it i don't know man you did kind of rage quit there for a minute but You mean I

(3:18:46) went and had a cigarette and then you went and had a cigarette you were very upset and then you left that to me is a rage quit but okay you mean you conceded

(3:18:52) the debate and I said "Okay I'm going to go have a cigarette." No you got very very upset oh okay that sounds like coke from a person who lost the debate but

(3:18:58) Okay sounds like you're kind of lying to yourself because you don't want to feel emasculated but Okay so if I'm a person

(3:19:04) who every single debate that I do on this uh podcast at about an hour to an hour and a half mark I stop the and get

(3:19:11) up and go have a cigarette do you think that I'm going to like change that behavior because you're here no okay so

(3:19:17) then it would follow that I just got up and went and had a cigarette cuz the specific timing of when you did that was

(3:19:22) a bit specific anyway Andrew you wanted to you wanted to respond to her position on like I it sounded like the systemic

(3:19:29) she would have to the problem with this is like when you're talking about systemic is she very she's very

(3:19:34) conveniently only points to hierarchal government right at the top and says well uh because that's male right at the

(3:19:41) top then uh then it can be systemic but it can't be systemic unless there's no at the top echelons of government it's

(3:19:47) like okay but what about like schools which are completely inundated with women most of the teachers are women

(3:19:53) most of the institutions are women most of the people participating are women like overwhelmingly that's a female

(3:19:59) institution it's like so can't teachers at the very least show sexism towards

(3:20:04) men systemically if an entire school decided we are not going to hire male

(3:20:09) teachers yeah I'd say that no how about like just systemically most of the teachers decide that they're going to institute standards which benefit little

(3:20:15) girls over little is do they do that currently what standards would you say just even

() 

(3:20:21) things like hold still for long periods of time be very quiet in class fold your hand clasp your hands when we look at

(3:20:27) studies for how boys learn versus how girls learn boys rambunctious they need breaks for much longer periods of time

(3:20:34) rough and tumble play needs to be encouraged things like that so schools definitely favor young girls over boys

(3:20:40) well I would say part of the reason why you have to sit still and be quiet in classes to maintain class order so that you can learn and I would also say as a

(3:20:47) young girl who's very rambunctious that that does negatively benefit some female students as well though that's really

(3:20:52) silly then because the negative outcome would be on co-ed schools which is what feminists push for whereas we used to

(3:20:59) have sex segregated schools where you could teach boys you know based on how boys uh benefit from being taught and

(3:21:06) girls now it's all I'm saying that if I'm a girl who benefits from how boys are being taught then why would

(3:21:11) separating me to a school that is exclusively No we would se you would get separated to a class with other girls who are like you but if the entire group

(3:21:19) So you're a segregationist if the entire What do you mean that how is that is saying that co co-ed schools have worse

(3:21:26) outcomes than girls or boys only school a segregationist so what like hang on

(3:21:31) answer my question first you plan on segregating boys and girls and separating them so they're not in the

(3:21:37) same schools and you want that universally everywhere but what do parents want their kids to

(3:21:42) be in classrooms why would they want that so that they can learn how to socialize with the opposite sex maybe they can learn how to socialize with the

(3:21:48) opposite sex like after school events uh various things like if you got sisters you would go to them the same way that

(3:21:53) we always did before we had co-ed schools learn the same way and not all girls learn the same way but inside of those schools it would be up to those

(3:22:00) schools to segregate those students who learned in different ways to put them in special education classes why not just do that in co-ed classrooms in which you

(3:22:07) have students who all learn the same regardless of gender because of universal because of universalization of

(3:22:12) the rules favoring one sex over the other which they do okay but if you had a co-ed classroom in which all students

(3:22:19) who learned a specific way regardless of their gender were in that room why not separate them on the basis of learning

(3:22:24) style instead of just the basis of sex yeah so if you're asking me like why wouldn't we take x amount of these kids

(3:22:31) and separate them over here and separate them over there it' be just a resource issue so we're already looking at 5% GDP

(3:22:37) if you were to have uh all all girls schools and all boy schools right and

(3:22:42) you separated them on the basis of all girl all boy you would be able to limit resources and allocate them much better

(3:22:48) to those genders okay but in public schools that's public schools i understand that so in public schools

(3:22:54) there's a certain amount of schools per district if you were going to separate all of those schools then there would be

(3:23:00) either double the schools for you could use the same amount you could use the

(3:23:06) same amount of resources to double the school so if it's the case that right now you had a school which was co-ed

(3:23:11) right you could split that school in half and still make one side boys only one side girls only if necessary that

(3:23:17) happened many many many times why not just do it based on learning style because because again you have x amount

(3:23:23) of resources which are allocated to a group if you begin to try to relocate

(3:23:29) every individualistic student into whatever core group you think they might learn best with ultimately rather than

(3:23:35) gender segregate you know that the core at least most of them share and then pick those the you know like the

(3:23:41) problematic kids out of that pool you're going to save a shitload of resources we tried that with black people and it did

(3:23:47) not go well we're not talking about segregating based on race but I mean if you're segregating based on sex what if

(3:23:52) one group is then funded less and I want you to think about So what if let's say what if we did do that and then there

(3:23:58) was a case in which teachers who were majority female were systemically discriminating against young boys yeah

(3:24:03) then you should get rid of those teachers and they defunded the schools that were boy how would they defund them

(3:24:09) or they choose not to teach those classes or they choose to teach those classes in a way that is not actually helpful to young boys yeah you could get

(3:24:16) teachers in that would do all male definitely do all male classrooms they have them right now and not only that we

(3:24:22) always had this by the way see this is I think the hang on hang on let's get into it like so for instance let me give you

(3:24:28) another few core ideas here uh if it is the case that you had sex segregated schools do you think sex and sexual

(3:24:34) intercourse and teenage pregnancy and STDs in schools would go up or down it

(3:24:40) depends on how we're teaching sex education in this no just like trivially if there's no women around they're not going to get pregnant right i don't know

(3:24:47) if people want to have sex I can find the ability to sex you know what this is giving it's giving like the number one birth control advice so let me So let me

(3:24:54) just make sure I got that i got this right if girls and boys go to different schools you don't actually think that

(3:25:00) they would be having underage sex more or less do I have that right i don't

(3:25:05) think that we can necessarily say if it would be more or less so I mean are they less horny like no they're just as horny but they

(3:25:12) just don't have access they don't have access why don't they have access because they're in different schools but

(3:25:17) do they not have a phone how How is they even if you have a phone how do you have the same access you do if Susie is

(3:25:24) sitting three [ __ ] desks down that's insane this is like a very This is giving Boomer a Are you ever going to

(3:25:30) respond respond to the argument you still have access to them through social media oh my god hey you want to meet up and is it as easy to meet up with them

(3:25:37) if you're not in the same school no i thought you just wanted to split schools in half some you could do it for some

(3:25:43) but for the other many open campus schools especially right especially high schools are so large you could split

(3:25:50) them in half and it would be like how a lot of high schools are now where you have one here and one just down the road

(3:25:56) okay and then they'd walk just down the road and oh my god look there's you still don't have you still don't have the access for talking to them for

(3:26:02) arranging it it's not to say that that wouldn't still happen but it would necessarily reduce that wouldn't it just

(3:26:08) necessarily it would be trivially true that if they did not have as much access to each other the chances that they're

(3:26:13) getting that they're having sex is triv at least trivially going to go down right sure but why not just increase the

(3:26:18) level of sex education in this because we've done nothing but promote sex education in school and it has not done

(3:26:25) anything to reduce the idea of STDs in kids at all i think that very much depends on the state and the district i

(3:26:31) think that's very much we do not have a universal sex education let me just ask you like this is that this is such a

(3:26:38) thing that's common sense and it drives me crazy with the left cuz they're so disingenuous about this do you really

(3:26:43) think as you tell me kids are smart and they have smartphones and they're going to [ __ ] if they want to [ __ ] but they're

(3:26:49) so [ __ ] stupid they don't understand what sex is what are kids so [ __ ] smart that

(3:26:56) they're going to intelligently bypass your sexually segregated schools in

(3:27:01) order to find each other to have sex but they're so [ __ ] stupid they don't know what sex is no one is claiming kids

(3:27:06) don't know what se sex is we're claiming that they don't know how to have sex safely oh you're So they're so smart

(3:27:11) they can do that but they can't figure out how to put a [ __ ] condom on apparently apparently i mean we see it all over the country children who do not

(3:27:18) have access to sex education have a 10 these little [ __ ] MacGyvers are going to figure out how to grab their smartphones and MacGyver out how to

(3:27:24) [ __ ] navigate to find each other to [ __ ] but they're not going to be able to figure out how to slap a condom on you've never been a child with a phone i

(3:27:30) have and I can tell you it's not that hard to find if you really want is it really hard to Google how to put a

(3:27:35) condom on yes but a lot of kids just genuinely do not know or do not latex or it hurts they're so [ __ ] smart and

(3:27:42) and by the way the idea too that religious parents don't instruct their children on what safe sex is insane i

(3:27:49) never said that and by the way the other problem that you have here is again you're attributing that these people that these kids have maggyver like

(3:27:56) stealth [ __ ] you know prowess where they can meet up with each other plan all this coordinate it when they're in

(3:28:01) sex segregated schools but can't figure out how to put on condoms or take birth control that's [ __ ] insane they should but it's not even about putting

(3:28:07) them on it's about having access i didn't know how to have access they would still have they still have the same access they're just in sex

(3:28:14) segregated schools but they just don't know but that's what I'm saying you don't have to do all that if the goal is to eliminate unprotected increasing

(3:28:21) sexual education in schools is not preventing these issues at all yes

(3:28:26) especially not when it comes to learning and how the rules favor little girls over little boys it's not helping with

(3:28:31) any of that how is sex ed helping with that sex ed so that kids know where to go

(3:28:37) like I learned what planned parenthood how is that helping with the bias towards little girls over little boys in

(3:28:43) school how well not sex education are you talking about safe sex or the bias yeah what I'm telling you is that you

(3:28:49) have additional benefits with sex segregated schools on top of the primary benefit of not having favoritism over

(3:28:55) one sex over the other okay but there are a lot of ways I feel like one thing that I'm really not loving about your

(3:29:01) argument is how different you claim girls and boys and men and women are they are very different they're not that

(3:29:06) different we are 99.9% similar and how similar are you to a chimpanzeee

(3:29:11) the same so are you very different from a chimpanzeee yeah but we have multiple chromosomes different than chimpanzees

(3:29:18) wait wait wait i'm sorry you just said we're 98 I'm sorry how much 98% no 99.9%

(3:29:25) similar 99.9% similar how genetically similar are we to chimpanzees yeah pull it up now I kind of want to know how

(3:29:30) genetically similar are human beings to chimpanzees are we the same species yes or no the same species men and women yes

(3:29:38) humans and chimps share a surprising 98.8% of their less

(3:29:44) 98.8% and we're very [ __ ] different aren't we 99.9% is the difference

(3:29:50) between one chromosome yeah but do you understand chromosome that if you're 98

(3:29:55) or like almost by the way that's almost 99% similar to like one of your ancestral cousins and you have that much

(3:30:02) of a stark difference that a 0.1 percentile can mean a huge difference and it does and here's the things that

(3:30:08) it means a difference in one sex can reproduce the other sex cannot one has physical characteristics that the other

(3:30:14) one does not one has uh strength advantages the other one does not one has emotional problems due to uh hormone

(3:30:21) regulation built into the body for reproduction that the other does not the list goes on and on and on of the

(3:30:27) distinct differences between males and females and they're huge i actually wrote down all of the distinct

(3:30:33) differences between men and women um so in terms of the physiological yes men have denser and stronger bones are 34%

(3:30:39) denser the difference in average oh we have difference in skull shapes and jaw shapes men have higher muscle mass

(3:30:45) percentage than women which attributes to the strength women have higher body fat percentage men on average are 7%

() 

(3:30:52) taller and then mentally it's mostly hormonal differences as we also you missed reproduction

(3:30:58) oh sure yes yeah women that's the big one right women have reproductive capacities including a uterus and they

(3:31:04) have trouble with hormone regulation due to the fact that they engage in reproduction right it's so funny that you say women have trouble with hormone

(3:31:10) regulation and all the time I hear how hard it is for men who have testosterone and how hard testosterone No you don't you don't hear that it's the fountain of

(3:31:16) youth for men keeps men young and it helps with their mood what you'll usually hear about for testo for

(3:31:22) testosterone in men is that if they have lower testosterone they have trouble with mood regulation okay yeah so if

(3:31:27) you're talking about women though they have trouble once per month with hormone regulation due to their reproduction

(3:31:32) cycle sure but that's not a ridiculously huge difference it's a massive difference that 12 times a [ __ ] year

(3:31:38) you have significant hormonal issues and by the way other significant hormone issues come up with the use of birth

(3:31:45) control the use and the use of things like this which are again tailored to one sex the sex that um is capable of

(3:31:53) reproduction so when you're talking about the distinctions between these sexes they're way wider than you are

(3:31:58) pretending they are why do you keep trying to separate us because we're not the same we're not the same people we're

(3:32:04) not survive without each other and we are the same species and these differences are necessarily negative can

(3:32:09) you tell me again how it is that we're not night and day difference when you have one sex who's extremely who's much

(3:32:15) stronger than the other much it's it's significant i don't know we both were not able to open that olive can yeah

(3:32:20) yeah so anyway um one sex is significantly stronger than the other

(3:32:26) sex one sex does not have the same trouble with hormone regulation does not have a uterus doesn't even have the same internal organs their plumbing doesn't

(3:32:33) even work the same way the way they urinate or the way they urinate other than a uterus no no no the way they

(3:32:39) urinate doesn't doesn't work the same way the the entire sexual plumbing doesn't work the same way the

(3:32:45) physiological differences are actually quite wide all you've mentioned is reproductive organs yes we all know we have different reproductive not just

(3:32:51) reproductive or o or organs we have different ways in which we engage with the world due to the different types of hormones we have and how they're

(3:32:57) regulated in our bodies we even have different brain patterns of how we think yes that's true but that's not such an

(3:33:03) horrifically and exclusive and large difference we should treat each other differently in many cases no and in many

(3:33:09) cases yes in so what cases would you I already told you like in cases where you have a predominant occupation of one sex

(3:33:15) over the other where they have power over young people right and they're in the dominant position they can only look

(3:33:21) at it from the preference of that sex if that's the case then if you had sex segregation in schools you would end up

(3:33:28) having more tailored education to that particular sex so can I say just my issue with all of the things that you're

(3:33:34) talking about is practical application it comes down to that is practical it's not impractical but wouldn't it be

(3:33:39) slightly more practical if we um encouraged men to be teachers instead of

(3:33:46) having to separate both the sexes just increasing the amount of males so that both men and women This is a great point

(3:33:53) can you can you explain a phenomenon which happens called male flight yeah male flight is when a career or

(3:34:01) profession becomes increasingly female dominated and then men tend to leave that profession and the pay rates go

(3:34:07) down yeah why do they say that they're leaving that profession i think there's a few reasons what's the primary reason

(3:34:12) i'm not sure actually will you give it to me give it hazard a guess what do you think it is cuz women are mean be Well

(3:34:19) just hazard a guess what do you actually think it is um in all honesty it might just be that

(3:34:26) they don't want to be they don't want to [ __ ] deal with women they don't want to deal with the the overage of women

(3:34:32) and the problems which are unique to them that women don't understand and vice versa expect to have a wife or a

(3:34:41) family or female children well it's really interesting right don't want to deal with women yeah the difference is

(3:34:48) is that having women have authority over you in a dominated female field is like

(3:34:53) hell on earth for men inside of your personal home where men are generally considered the head of the household

(3:34:59) that problem doesn't exist so men are incapable of working with women if women hold i didn't say incapable did I you said it was hell i asked you about the

(3:35:06) Is it really hard to have a female boss Andrew not female boss it's when you have a saturated When you have a

(3:35:13) saturated female demographic in a job you have male flight you said we have male flight and you hazarded your only

(3:35:19) guess was cuz they don't like women basically can you actually look up the reasons for male flight yeah look it up

(3:35:26) i mean that just sounds like [ __ ] to me it's like oh I can't have a job because women are here i mean that's

(3:35:31) crazy because they cause unique problems right from the perspective of the men who they're in charge of and you don't

(3:35:37) think men cause unique problems to women perhaps but here's the thing women don't fly away from male-dominated professions

() 

(3:35:44) it's only men who fly away from female dominated male dominated professions tend to make more money i mean that might be part of No that's not always

(3:35:50) the case especially not with education i mean when we're talking about male flight the phenomenon like nurse let's

(3:35:56) take like nursing for instance nursing is a very highly paid profession but one of the reasons that they can't get male

(3:36:02) nurses in is because they don't want to [ __ ] deal with women you say that nursing is a very highly paid profession

(3:36:09) but compared to doctors which are much more male-dominated they make significantly more than nurses despite

(3:36:14) both having to get Are you saying that women have the same access to become

(3:36:20) doctors as men in fact through your ideas of DEI not go to college you can

(3:36:25) still go to college well not if we wait until Okay actually let's go back to your whole let's wait until after you

(3:36:30) have kids to go to college if a woman really wanted to become a doctor that's four years of college and six years of

(3:36:36) medical school and then a residency and then a residency so that's But they're doing the residency as a doctor basically yeah so that's like But it's

(3:36:42) about like it's around like I want to say 10 years yeah so okay so if you start Mhm going to college at 40 after

(3:36:50) your kids Well would you say you start at like 32 33 probably and you'd be done about 41 42 involved in a residency

(3:36:57) while you're raising children for that particular occupation yeah as well as school why is that any different than

(3:37:02) just having a job while you're raising kids what do you mean well the whole premise is that women would wait after

(3:37:09) they've had children to go to school but you also said that women in the workforce it doesn't split it doesn't

(3:37:15) split the attention from the children and the attention on the job like for instance would you say especially this

(3:37:21) example you picked the worst one attention in Would you say that if a woman wanted

(3:37:26) to become a doctor and have children that that would that would be

(3:37:31) considerable in the way of time that she would have to spend working on being a

(3:37:37) doctor like a considerable amount of time especially at a residency but I'm not against women spending time on their

(3:37:43) careers while children yeah yeah but but don't you think that that's going to defer attention in a major way well if

(3:37:49) you're taking care of their children as well they're working but if both partners are working and if both partners are taking care of their kids

(3:37:55) and their kids are getting equal what's happening is you're just outsourcing care you're just going to outsource the

(3:38:00) care from the mother you don't have to do that you do have to do that how do both parents work but you don't outsource any care my parents did it how

(3:38:08) my dad had a more flexible schedule when my mom was there she took care of me when my dad was there he took care of

(3:38:13) when nobody was there who took care of you i mean I think they were almost always

(3:38:19) there okay so unless they went on like a date night so then they both weren't working full-time then they were both working full-time okay so you happen to

(3:38:25) be in the one unique position where so flexible one parent could always be home

(3:38:31) with you yes i went to school that is not the case for the vast majority of your children go to school they're outsourcing so you're outsourcing your

(3:38:37) care to school mhm so if a person starts So if these people start their workday I

(3:38:42) thought you were talking about a nanny consider school to be outsourcing child care yes of course okay but it's also

(3:38:49) like like it's illegal to not provide an education yeah but does school need to be 8 n hours a day

(3:38:56) i mean it's like 8 to if we are producing some of the least educated children on planet earth in any western

(3:39:01) nation is the 8 hour school day really something that's beneficial the reason it's 8 n hours is exactly for that to

(3:39:09) try to accommodate a two parent income and be a babysitting apparatus by the state so what would you advocate as the

(3:39:15) amount yeah I would say two hours of school a day is perfectly acceptable two hours of school get the [ __ ] out well I

(3:39:22) don't know how many hours of school a day that you do what do you What is it like 10 minutes for social studies half an hour no no no you don't do you don't

(3:39:28) do subjects like that people don't learn like that so what do we do we do farming oh you would do you would do months on just math or months on just reading

() 

(3:39:35) writing and arithmetic you don't have to split the studies two hours a day a month of each subject sure why because

(3:39:43) people's minds especially young minds are tailored much better when you're trying to learn detailed things like

(3:39:49) this with having um you know an hour or two and then a lot of play time and a lot of unlearning and a lot of things

(3:39:55) like that kids actually do a lot better yeah they unlearn things you're learning things for two hours and then you just spend the rest of the day unlearning

(3:40:00) what you just learned no not unlearning what you just learned you would be unlearning other things

(3:40:06) like what like bad habits that you'd have like you can't take the cookie out of the cookie jar because you get your hand smacked by the way it's 7:16 and

(3:40:12) he's calling me now hey bun you want to come up do you mind

(3:40:19) grabbing my boyfriend for me yeah we're gonna close out now okay all right see

(3:40:25) you in a sec love you bye but just real quick I got this last question sure how is it

(3:40:31) that you you went to school and had hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours of learning right yes okay great how did

(3:40:38) you think that millions of people died on the Trail of Tears then they were forcibly removed from their

(3:40:44) You thought millions of people died on the trail of tears i guess all those hours and hours and hours and hours and

(3:40:49) hours of history really didn't sink into well well I mean learning complex thought and reading comprehension doesn't just mean like most kids can

(3:40:56) read you got a number wrong like Andrew and and here's the thing right is like if you're especially when you're talking

(3:41:01) about reading and literacy home homeschool kids outperform public school kids oh it's not even in the same

(3:41:08) universe and usually most of those curriculums hour or two a day what is your source on that one oh I can pull up

(3:41:13) a ton homeschooling has become one of the biggest alternative and most studied alternatives since co 19 because of the

(3:41:19) lockdowns i have a pretty cool documentary about homeschooling i guess do you guys want to do a mini close you

(3:41:24) each get like a final one or two minutes well I'll just make it super easy so or well should we'll let her go first then

(3:41:30) you so go ahead if you want to do a one to two minute close then you then we're out okay i mean I just think a lot of

(3:41:37) what we just talked about is objectively a little bit ridiculous i don't understand why you would segregate

(3:41:43) children and massively increase or decrease the hours that kids are in

(3:41:48) schools and now women don't work and now all of these things it sounds like you want to turn society upside down which

(3:41:54) you know good for you but I would advocate that it's better

(3:41:59) to It's not completely broken but it's not like if you

(3:42:05) understand like the system we live in is not completely broken to the point where you have to completely and radically

(3:42:10) destroy it and create an an alternative that has no practical application at all

(3:42:18) like we've never done that we've never done segregated schools for two hours a

(3:42:25) day really when did we nationally have public schools that were 2 hours a day

(3:42:31) separated by gender it's your clothes okay yeah i mean to me this just seems

(3:42:37) unrealistic it seems unnecessary and it doesn't seem like it's really benefiting other one anyone but you I guess and I

(3:42:46) don't understand why you would advocate for such impossibly impractical things other than

(3:42:54) to sell your debate course you should have taken it so the what's

(3:43:01) interesting is like uh your entire closing statement just a giant fallacy it was just an appeal to incredility

(3:43:06) it's just like I just think it's like really like impractical and like it doesn't make sense it is impractical did

(3:43:12) I interrupt your clothes once no no you just I just like think like it's impractical and stuff it's like well

(3:43:18) that's not an argument for anything and you can see it on all the descriptive points that I give for these problems

(3:43:23) you say I just don't like the prescriptions that's fair you can criticize the prescriptions but when I ask what the criticism of the

(3:43:29) prescription is it's just like uh well like I just like think maybe it won't like work or or or whatnot or you know

(3:43:36) what we've never done this before we have we never had sex segregated schools we did they only they never only lasted

(3:43:42) a couple hours a day they most certainly did like if we go back through history and you look at what local schools used

(3:43:48) to be yeah they they didn't take very long there was one single school master these were in much smaller towns the

(3:43:53) tailoring by the way if you look at what an eighth grade education was like a 100 years ago it's the equivalent of a

(3:43:58) college education today and the literacy rate was through the roof in comparison to what it is now it's not even the same

(3:44:05) universe if you go back even to the uh 20s 30s 40s 50s it's not even in the

(3:44:10) same universe when you're talking about uh co-ed schools um there's all sorts of

(3:44:15) dis disadvantages which include sex which include uh STD rates which include

(3:44:21) now revenge corn which include all sorts of things which now technology has enabled and it's like you can deal with

(3:44:28) a lot of those problems especially with how kids are related to by female teachers when they're young men by

(3:44:33) segregating out the sexes in school it's a great idea most everybody does it at

(3:44:39) least if they have a brain and it works great you keep separating us and sending us back the closings are done you don't

(3:44:46) want you want to argue after the close weird man i'm sorry that I have prescriptions and I have arguments other

(3:44:52) than weird i mean if you guys want to continue the conversation but it you know

(3:45:00) it's like weird man like everyone should just get together like and sing kumbaya man no we shouldn't just get together

(3:45:05) and sing Kumbaya but we should try and advance the society instead of trying to do things that we already did thousands

(3:45:11) of years ago the literacy rate's doing real well good job advancing society the literacy rate is not doing bad because

(3:45:17) of feminism andrew get over yourself like this is what is it doing bad because why how can you attribute it to

() 

(3:45:24) feminism i asked you a question why is it doing bad the literacy rate in this country is largely failing because the

(3:45:29) public education system which is full of women teaching is incredibly underfunded and inherent 5% of our GDP more than any

(3:45:37) other nation it's underfunded it is underfunded and we continue to overfunding but that's by it's the most

(3:45:43) it's the most overfunded underfunded thing in the planet it's by district

(3:45:48) it's not funded by the federal government and they get the same amount per district public schools are Yes no

(3:45:55) they don't yes they do no the [ __ ] they don't know [ __ ] public schools are funded by property taxes depends on the

(3:46:00) district you get paid by the head for federal funding federal funding yes but

(3:46:06) public schools do not receive the primarity of their funding or the majority of their funding through

(3:46:12) federal funding yes they do yes they do no they don't

(3:46:19) all right here's what we can do if you guys are both open to it we'll do a round two uh at some future date would
