(0:34) thank you
(0:45) ladies and gentlemen welcome to the one and only
(0:51) completely Centrist new debate
(0:56) Management Group welcome to Crucible everyone
(1:02) as some were most of you know those with high IQs I am Paul PF Young
(1:08) the ultimate moderator a glorious enlightened Centrist and I've come here because Andrew Wilson's
(1:16) sidekick eunuch Zen Shapiro is busy with something so naturally I've filled in
(1:23) tonight's debate is on feminism vague
(1:29) controversial and
(1:34) feminine the three best qualities of any debate
(1:40) now Andrew asked me to kill a few minutes I'm at the beginning so Chad can fill up
(1:46) now one of the things I do for my colleague Andrew is I allow the audience to donate super
(1:52) chats and to fund this backwards two-bit operation of which Zen Shapiro is
(1:59) allegedly the brains of according to our last exchange so anyone
(2:04) who's interested by all means throw some sleeper chats in read or I'll
(2:10) read the oh well I guess I have to read all of those if you pay money it's uh it's worth it I'll have you know that
(2:17) Andrew doesn't pay me [ __ ] and that's fine I don't pay my moderators [ __ ] or anything so what goes
(2:23) around comes around so that's all really I have to say I
(2:29) should probably pull up the uh The Crucible chat I don't even know if oh here we go all right let's see
(2:35) um FYI this is how I do things um I don't
(2:42) want to get involved in anyone's drama okay so this debate I'm gonna let it go
(2:47) where it needs to go and if these man children can't handle themselves then I'll step in
(2:55) but otherwise like all important issues as a Centrist I'd like to just ride in the middle and
(3:01) hopefully no one uh takes any issue with me because that's really my goal in life is to just
(3:07) simply blend into the herd and do absolutely nothing of any
(3:12) of any significance hence why I'm here on a Saturday night on a holiday weekend
(3:19) so that'll be fun um let's see here uh PF you are killing
(3:25) these minutes thanks Bonsai I appreciate it definitely killing the minutes amen killing for sure
(3:34) um so yeah so uh
(3:40) we'll kill a few more minutes here and uh I told Andrew I said Andrew the last
(3:45) time that I moderated your debate um Zen Shapiro and his lackeys got quite
(3:52) upset with me and then he said I don't give a [ __ ] come and do it
(3:58) and so I obliged because at the end of the day the most important thing in this world
(4:04) is respect the world runs on respect and if we cannot respect those who we feel
(4:11) they're moderating skills are subpar then who can we respect
(4:16) why would I ever show up on a crucible debate with Zen Shapiro if I did not respect
(4:23) his Superior moderating anyway we got about 30 seconds
(4:29) until I say the magic words let the show begin um if anyone has any any super chat so
(4:35) far do I have to be in the uh regular YouTube chat to see these or can I just see these in the regular comments
(4:43) no Jack what's up PF what's up narrow Jack Nero Jack
(4:48) among the most sane of The Crucible audience and let's be real ninety percent of The Crucible audience
(4:55) is great it's just the Mosh Pit Chat that is could use a little more Jordan peace in their lives but anyway
(5:01) Andrew let's start the show
(5:10) [Music]
(5:18) [Music]
(5:27) oh
(5:32) [Music]
(5:41) [Music]
(6:08) all right [Music]
(6:20) [Music]
(6:37) thank you
(6:43) ladies and gentlemen welcome back I put all that hard work into the intro and this channel in
(6:48) general and it's finally paying off we have our two contestants here with the blood and rhetoric and Glory
(6:56) will be spilled and won tonight the Challenger tonight
(7:01) is richer otherwise known as vegan gains being gains welcome welcome to the show hello
(7:07) and the defender looking unusually White Collar today
(7:13) quite a departure from his kylo Ren lightsaber hoodie
(7:18) is Andrew Wilson welcome Andrew to your own show yeah appreciate you moderating tonight okay no problem
(7:25) um well the debate is about feminism vegan gains has some challenges too and
(7:32) to Wilson's takes apparently Andrew talks about feminism he's not aware of that
(7:37) but uh since vegan gains is the Challenger we will let him go first
(7:42) and we will wish him luck so by all means go ahead you have seven minutes
(7:48) sure so um I contacted Andrew Andrew for this debate because of a debate that I saw
(7:55) him engage in with a feminist named pharah uh in that debate I thought Andrew said
(8:02) some kind of funny things and Andrea can correct me if I'm wrong but the gist of
(8:09) it was um he didn't believe women should have a right to vote due to them not being able
(8:16) to protect their rights uh or fight for their rights as men can
(8:23) now as far as rights being granted to women uh it is true the reason rights
(8:30) are granted to women is because men have decided to grant them rights
(8:35) it's also true that Society at large has decided to grant gay people rights trans
(8:43) people rights black people rights gingers rights disabled people rights
(8:49) rights are dependent on them being granted so this is true for not only
(8:55) groups but also individuals the reason that any particular person including Andrew has any rights is because again
(9:02) most of the people that he comes into contact with in society at large has decided to grant
(9:09) him rights so I don't see how that's unique um a unique aspect of women as a group
(9:17) that rights are granted them rights have to be granted to everybody
(9:22) and as far as their ability to fight for their rights I don't see how women have
(9:32) a lack of ability to fight for their rights as they certainly have uh not only in the women's suffrage movement
(9:38) but we see women have engaged in Warfare we have seen women support War efforts
(9:46) and I also don't understand how that relates to voting so I'd like Andrew to
(9:52) explain some of this uh because there are certainly people who have no ability
(9:58) to fight period let alone fight for their rights I mean there's mentally disabled
(10:03) people there's physically disabled people and there's physically disabled people who are mentally disabled who in
(10:09) no way can make arguments in support of the idea of their rights they cannot
(10:16) physically fight for their rights yet we grant them rights
(10:21) and they also have a right to vote so I I'd like to hear some of this kind
(10:29) of explained and broken down by Andrew and that uh that is my opening statement
(10:37) thank you good sir riveting excellent setup for glorious duel
(10:43) Angie response you have seven minutes yeah so let's kind of dive into this
(10:48) um first you say that you believe a woman having a right to vote based on
(10:53) you you said something along the lines of I don't understand how it is that a
(10:59) woman doesn't have the right to vote just because a man hasn't allowed her to have that right to vote which to me
(11:05) seems kind of absurd because you then went on to say yes it's true that men grant women rights now I think you were
(11:12) trying to make the statement that you think Society but right which is everybody and nobody and anybody and
(11:18) somebody uh grants rights to everybody but this would actually be inaccurate so the first thing that you said is Society
(11:24) at large uh has granted the X Factor's rights so the X Factor would be
(11:29) basically everybody that's not a dominant man right would be uh gays is a
(11:34) marginalized group black is a marginalized group things like this uh but that's also not true men granted
(11:40) them rights that it was men who granted them rights and men can take those rights away from those groups whenever
(11:47) they so choose and they do all the time they've done it all over the world they've taken rights away from gays and
(11:52) there's nothing gays can do about it they take rights away from women there's nothing women can do about it they take rights away from people all the time as
(11:59) a dominant social group um you say that rights have to be granted this is also not true or at
(12:06) least it's only a half truth men can grant themselves rights if they get enough of them together they can decide
(12:12) that even if they're being oppressed that they don't want to be oppressed anymore they don't like that [ __ ] very much and they can take up arms and Grant
(12:18) themselves rights and have done that historically many many many times so no
(12:23) men don't have to necessarily Grant other men their rights that's the point whereas they do have to Grant it to to
(12:30) women they they have to because women can't do that and men can the women's suffrage movement which you
(12:36) brought up that was not women fighting for their rights that was women whining for their rights there was no fight
(12:43) anywhere where was the fight where were these women taking up arms where were they bashing them in over the head where
(12:49) were they taking the men on where were they taking on the patriarchy with hands feet Fist and gun nowhere they were just
(12:56) whining and they were heavily supported by men's funding or it never would have
(13:03) happened to begin with so no they've never they've never fought their white rights ever they've just
(13:08) whined they don't they don't fight they can't fight what are they going to do they can't do anything to men as a
(13:14) collective can simply put their foot down on women whenever they they so choose even as a small Collective even
(13:20) if they're outnumbered ten to one they can still do this we've seen this in France for instance in World War II where two-thirds of the population
(13:26) post-world War II was completely and totally devastated he only had one third or the last some some estimates are as
(13:33) low as 19 of the population uh was was men that's how low the estimate in some
(13:39) cases could be because of how many died between World War one and World War II so no I I disagree kind of heavily with
(13:46) all of your positions now when it comes to kind of your main contention which is voting voting in and of itself I don't
(13:52) consider it to be necessarily evil or moral good or a moral imperative of any kind I think it's just one system of
(13:58) many systems but still men are going to be the ones who create that system and
(14:03) Grant that system to women so that's um that's my position on this
(14:09) okay so do you believe women should have right to vote real quick real quick before we get in the back and forth just
(14:15) want to say a couple things thank you for the opening statement Andrew uh here in The Crucible we do things a little bit differently uh I as the moderator
(14:20) will not be getting involved and just officially for the FBI agent and agent of Assad watching uh I do not endorse
(14:27) anyone's perspective on here I am merely moderating for the sake of discussion uh we'll go for an hour and a half back and
(14:33) forth and then we'll take questions and super chats I will not be reading the super chats until the Q a
(14:40) but until then good luck guys all right go ahead man what was your question yeah so do you
(14:47) believe women should have a right to vote or not if men granted to him I mean I don't
(14:53) think that I don't think that women um I don't think that men
(14:58) ought to do horrible or evil things to women I don't think that they ought to do that but I also think that they're in
(15:05) a particularly unique situation due to the fact that they make Society run and
(15:11) they're The Operators which make Society run where that's going to be uniquely their decision to make
(15:18) okay but you're the basis for whether or not you think women should have right to vote is
(15:24) whether or not men decide to give them a right to vote yeah that's correct
(15:29) okay so say if men had an interest in
(15:34) the political system to vote for say repealing women's rights
(15:42) yeah um you don't think women should have any sort of political power in a system
(15:48) where they can also vote and influence political change for their
(15:55) own benefit well it's more correct to say that they wouldn't and it's not a matter of what I would what I would ought it's just a matter if
(16:02) they could not so whether I would ought it to be true or not ought to be true what descriptively is true is that they
(16:09) can't they can't stop men from taking away their rights they just can't do it they have right but you you did say that
(16:18) um you did say that you're against the idea
(16:23) of doing horrible things to women right so like yeah and man in theory you'd be against something like spousal grape
(16:32) um I mean it depends on how that's defined but I mean in general any type of grape I would be against yeah
(16:39) well like strangling somebody forcing your yourself upon them you'd be against
(16:45) something like that right yeah okay well I believe still to this day there's a
(16:52) few states that don't actually recognize uh spousal uh spazzle rape so
(17:00) right so women would be and so so men if
(17:05) they wanted to could go into those states with guns and they could say you're going to change this [ __ ] law
(17:11) right women but women can't vegan gains they can't do that that's
(17:18) the distinction not no they can't um so they don't know they can't can you
(17:25) name it single time in history where they yeah go ahead so the women's suffrage movement um in France in particular
(17:32) women actually uh grab pole arms so not just
(17:37) um pitchforks but also they got things like halberds uh and Spears and they actually uh
(17:45) marched and demanded a right to vote um bombs and uh
(17:50) and um what is it fires were also set on businesses during the women's suffrage
(17:56) movement um how many men did women kill for their rights in France
(18:02) well I I don't know how that matters because really ultimately because if the
(18:07) men in France said no [ __ ] put your polls down you stupid [ __ ] or else we're gonna smack the [ __ ] out of you
(18:12) they couldn't do anything Richard well not okay so not every right that's
(18:18) fought for requires like extreme physical violence
(18:24) requires forces yeah yeah well how do you back up rights without Force Richard tell me well I'm saying not every right
(18:31) that is being granted has required a World War
(18:37) well first of all I think I think it depending I'm trying to figure out
(18:42) what you mean but I think it has I think every single right you have requires Force I can't think of a right that
(18:48) doesn't require force to be enforced can you well to be enforced yes but I'm saying
(18:55) to be granted no yeah to be granted because because and
(19:00) I'll tell you why that that has to be true because if you grant a right to a person what actually gives them the
(19:06) right if there's no Force so how can they keep the right if
(19:13) there's no Force allowing them to keep the right in other words if I say no no wife you don't have any [ __ ] rights
(19:20) she can call men and they can come arrest my ass using Force so force is the mechanism for rights
(19:26) so you you have a right to free speech like the first amendment
(19:32) um how many times have you seen police interactions where police officers
(19:37) violate First Amendment rights so somebody's protesting they say you can't have that sign here they get arrested
(19:43) well how does this play out this plays out in court I don't think there's ever been a situation where
(19:50) I I don't know like it it there like there's a shootout over whether or not
(19:55) somebody can hold a sign up well okay well there has been I'm except
(20:03) it can give you a perfect distinction which is the Civil War and the Revolutionary War these are distinctions
(20:10) where people said no we're not going to you know pay maybe your tax or your tariff or we we don't want this type of
(20:17) compelled speech or we don't want to be oppressed in our speech in these ways uh various factors came into all sorts of
(20:23) small micro Revolutions in fact another example that I can give you I believe that it was called the Battle of Athens
(20:30) which happened inside of America that this was an American city and the the
(20:35) police magistrate was so corrupt that men went home and got their guns and
(20:40) went back to town and literally overthrew the local magistrate and and put in their own government so in other
(20:47) words when they felt oppressed they could just go do something about it I would like to see an example of that by
(20:52) women anywhere in history ever
(20:59) um okay so I don't know of any
(21:04) um again aside from like women's suffrage where women did actually in
(21:09) fact take up arms um at least in Europe that's not taking up arms taking up arms
(21:16) same no taking up arms is your your like actually walking down the street and
(21:22) killing people that's taking up arms against something okay well in that example you just gave were people shot
(21:29) and murdered yeah in fact there was a massive shootout they raided the National Guard Armory and they had a
(21:35) battle all night okay in any case like ultimately
(21:42) um if you have enough of a societal disruption to where the only sort of
(21:50) um the only way to resolve this is either by again granting rights or
(21:55) coming to I don't know some fight and literally having forced aside uh whether or not
(22:03) rights will like who gets the right the rights they want
(22:08) um women have done this like again women's suffrage it's just that men decided it's not worth it
(22:13) to actually uh take up arms against women and fight no that's absolutely here's what happened most women were
(22:21) against the vote most women let me say that again were against the vote most of
(22:26) them so you had anti-suffragettes which aren't covered in history very often but
(22:31) the anti-suffragette movement was much higher in feminist used feminist propaganda and they used the money of
(22:38) giant Elite men in order to push through the agenda and it still wasn't even popular after it passed it still wasn't
(22:44) even popular after it passed for a long while and you want to know what the reasoning is behind the
(22:50) anti-suffragettes the women who were against the right to vote is they said we can't enforce our own rights we don't
(22:56) have the ability to do that so why should we be able to vote why why would we be able to vote we
(23:01) can't enforce it men have to enforce it say that like what do you mean by women cannot enforce their own rights like it
(23:09) means that as a small monolith of any size of virtually any size there could
(23:16) be like some maybe extreme examples but if you have let's just say 10 of the men
(23:21) of a population who decide that they're not going to follow or obey a law or
(23:27) they're going to oppress women or they're going to do whatever the [ __ ] they want there's really not very much that can be done about it by anybody
(23:34) except men so men are going to be the people who push force and therefore they're the ones who are the grantor of
(23:41) Rights either to themselves or to women or to anybody so you could take the same
(23:46) tone in slavery you could say that men granted men rights men fought for their
(23:51) right to not be slaves all of this would be true but women play very little in the way of a role of that because they
(23:57) just physically can't what do you mean physically can't like women can pick up a gun and shoot so
(24:03) what do you mean physically can't yeah but have you seen what happens in the statistics when you take uh female
(24:09) soldiers and you apply the statistical or the standard the application standard
(24:14) for just uh regular basic training and have women go through it they have to give them entirely different standards
(24:21) because their upper body strength is so slight their lower body strength can't handle it they have completely different
(24:26) standards which is why to this day to this day I don't believe there's even been a single woman who has gotten
(24:32) through actual Seal Team training not a single one and this is the difference between men and women now you you're you
(24:40) operate under physique you know this this is true you know that you're ginormously strong in comparison to
(24:46) women just the amount of weapons that you could wield would be superior to what a woman could
(24:53) um I've seen so I don't know if the Army's done uh their own research I've
(25:00) seen the uh research on Marines the Marine Corps did a study uh comparing
(25:06) female and male you know soldiers
(25:11) yeah women are less physically capable so they can't carry as much equipment I
(25:17) think it's like a difference of like 30 pounds or something like that a total equipment they can carry they're also
(25:24) more likely to get injured this and that but like again there are
(25:31) um there are like um within group differences where you can
(25:38) find exceptionally physically fit women and exceptionally like inadequate men so
(25:45) you do in these like stats see women who are outpacing some men I don't
(25:52) understand that I've I've known dudes who are like five foot there are exceptional there are exceptionally strong women and there are exceptions
(25:58) but like at the end of the day um the Marine Corps did determine that
(26:04) it is suitable especially in cases where like certain
(26:09) um combat roles can't be filled because we have a huge obesity problem
(26:16) um like the amount of eligible recruits is really narrow
(26:21) um and especially in a situation where you're not going to have forced conscription um it's going to be very difficult to
(26:27) fill all the necessary combat rules true but their preference would be that men filled those roles and not women well
(26:34) that would be the preference but it'd also be the preference but why would it becoming physical like again well again
(26:40) why wait wait well let me finish it would also be a preference to have women
(26:46) fill these roles as opposed to obese men yeah that's true so do you think fat people shouldn't
(26:53) have right there's plenty of women but there's plenty of there's plenty of fat women too like I mean in equal numbers
(26:58) so so they're the only reason they're drawing the right to vote the only reason they're drawing from women is because there's not enough men that's it
(27:04) and the other thing is is that the preference here is always going to be for men why Richard why is it always
(27:10) going to be for men over women when it comes to milk the men on average are more physically fit right because
(27:16) because fighting isn't just about picking up a gun fighting is also about living in trenches it's about having
(27:22) very little to eat it's about being physically strong enough to endure the elements it's about a lot more than just
(27:29) oh I picked up a gun and now I could go fight for my rights that's not how it [ __ ] goes yeah well again like you're kind of
(27:37) glossing over this there are requirements for the military like you can't just be like a fat [ __ ] and end
(27:43) up you know joining the military there are certain physical and mental standards and at the moment there are so few men
(27:52) that meet those physical and mental requirements that we're now recruiting massive amounts of women more than ever
(27:59) before to fill combat roles yeah but but they're still very cool I don't even understand those requirements there's
(28:04) still very few women who can meet those requirements even with all these fat men around so it's still always going to be
(28:10) unequally yoked to the point of of extremity unless you can demonstrate that men or that women uh even uh going
(28:18) up against unhealthy men when they're at their fittest are going to Prevail because most of the time even then
(28:23) they're not going to so even if a woman who's five foot five and jacked goes up against a six foot two fat dude I'm
(28:29) still putting my money on the six foot two bit fat dude and so are you you are too tell me you're not tell me you're
(28:35) not dude but for the most part on average you would right
(28:40) um like again that depends I I've seen MMA fights where uh like a man goes up
(28:47) against a woman but the woman is about the same size come on these people aren't interested these people aren't sure most people are
(28:54) not trained in uh in in hand-to-hand combat in years of training in MMA
(29:00) that's ridiculous the average woman who would have to fight for her rights against a monolith of men even if they
(29:06) were big fat men okay big fatty fatsos women are five foot five five foot six
(29:11) five foot seven you're telling me you think that physically they're gonna do better against men right but the point that you're glossing
(29:19) over is that there's many men who are completely inequipped or inadequate to
(29:24) either fight in the military or even fight for the rest just as many women so so again you're still you still have the
(29:30) energy Equalization I don't understand I don't understand why you're looking at
(29:35) at this um from a group level and not to some extent at least at an individual level
(29:41) like should people who are that would be the worst way that would be the worst way to look at it because because it's
(29:47) an individual no individual can enforce their rights for the most part they can only do it on a small scale maybe
(29:52) against other individuals but it takes a collective or at least a small group to
(29:58) be able to enforce the rights for for themselves and the people who are around them individuals themselves they have a
(30:04) hard time enforcing their individual rights in other words it's essentially impossible to do so if there was one
(30:10) woman who said I want the right to vote and nobody else wanted to have the right to vote you would agree with me immediately she ain't getting the [ __ ]
(30:16) right to vote right um so I mean that's just it but if you have if you so we would have to look at
(30:22) this as collective same thing with men if one man wants the right to vote he ain't getting it but if you have a
(30:27) hundred million men who want the right to vote they're [ __ ] getting it okay so
(30:33) um is this purely a descriptive claim you're making or are you also making
(30:38) this a sort of a normative claim where um it's almost like a might makes right like because there is such an amount of
(30:46) power within a certain group they should be able to either Grant or take
(30:52) authorites away right no so let me let me explain this might makes right is is fundamentally
(31:00) from my Christian worldview untrue I think that might descriptively makes
(31:05) I'm just not saying that it it it it ought make right in other words I don't think that just because you're mighty
(31:12) and you enforce your will that that means you're doing a moral thing or you're doing a righteous thing or you're doing a good thing
(31:18) you see what I'm saying does that make sense to you sure okay yeah
(31:23) um and going back a bit um you don't think it's either a good or
(31:31) bad thing that men Grant women's rights you're like neutral on it
(31:37) uh well no I mean I think it's it I would have to descriptively say that
(31:42) because this is the hierarchical order which is put put forward by our Almighty creator that it's probably a good thing
(31:49) and yes I do think that it's generally a good thing for the hierarchy to be
(31:55) um to be run by men yeah and and it always has been and it always will be so you think it's a good thing that women
(32:03) don't have a right to vote if men decide that they don't have a right to vote and they do it as a
(32:10) collective I think that yeah I don't see a problem with that why would that be a problem okay well for quite a long time
(32:18) and even to this day in some states and in
(32:23) probably most countries uh women have absolutely no recourse if
(32:28) they are raped by their husbands there's no laws granting them a protection
(32:35) against something like that like that sort of spousal abuse that's not true that is true that's not true that is
(32:42) true there show me an example of where you can pin your wife down by force and rape her and this is not something which
(32:49) she can go and get recourse from the law I don't believe you well again um there's no particular law written on
(32:57) the books in certain States stating that a woman can be raped by their spouse and
(33:04) actually in in and by the way well that's a name well hang on that's an affirmative right in the United States
(33:10) rights are affirmed in the negative so in other words to frame this the best way I can for you you don't have a right
(33:17) to vote right now Richard did you know that your right to vote is affirmed in the negative you have no
(33:22) right to vote you've never had a right to vote the what the amendment says specifically is that if a vote is had
(33:28) they have to let you vote but there's no actual right to vote you can look it up right now there's no actual right to vote in the
(33:35) United States your rights here affirmed in the negative in other words our constitution only spells out what the
(33:41) government can't do it doesn't spell out what it must do so it can't restrict our
(33:46) guns it can't restrict our speech it can't restrict this you can't do this it's not allowed to do that it's not allowed to do this it doesn't say what
(33:51) it has to do uh let me look this up real quick yeah just put in voting negative Rights
(33:58) Voting is a negative right
(34:09) only two states Oregon and New Jersey have abolished the marital exemption rule the legal system of most countries
(34:15) exempt the husband from prosecution of the rape of his wife um this is from Office of Justice
(34:23) programs so that's an affirmative right but so what I need you to demonstrate for me then all 50 states of the Union
(34:30) that if a woman goes to the police and just don't use the r word say grape
(34:36) great sure okay but if she goes to the police and says I was graped by my
(34:41) husband he penned me down and forced me into a sexual sexual intercourse uh that
(34:46) she has no recourse I don't believe that okay well um
(34:52) for one thing you there are many many women that you can find you can put out
(34:58) a call on your Twitter um whatever social media and you don't believe them yourself Richard because I
(35:04) saw a video I saw a video of you yourself make the claim that a woman had
(35:10) lied yeah about getting great women can't lie that's right so you yourself don't believe all women you don't
(35:16) believe all women right no I I believe people based on the strength of evidence
(35:21) of their claim um but like by the way even if you [ __ ]
(35:29) don't believe that there's been a single case of a woman uh getting graped by their husband and having no reason not
(35:35) what I said in the united well we can we can literally look at other countries who on the books like Islamic countries
(35:43) well do you plan on invading those countries splits it right sorry D are you planning on invading those countries
(35:49) okay well the the point you made is that men have dominion over women essentially
(35:54) yeah um because we're the ones who Grant the rights and can take it away so I can say it's immoral in those Nations for
(36:00) those men under my Christian worldview to Grape their wives to force their wives to have sex with them I think that
(36:06) that's a morally abhorrent why would that be more if you can demonstrate it because it would be against my religious values it would be against my ethical
(36:12) system so I would say that that's immoral well no I can also make the descriptive claim that unless you plan
(36:20) on invading those Nations to stop them then you're basically agreeing with me that men have the Dominion because there
(36:26) ain't [ __ ] you can do about it there ain't [ __ ] they can do about it well Andrew you wouldn't disagree with them
(36:31) because again you said men have dominion over women if men have had the imperative to deny those rights uh to
(36:38) women then that would be the right thing to do not unlimited Dominion that's not what I said that wasn't my claim well
(36:44) you didn't say claim that what did I claim specifically that women should not be treated poorly they should not be
(36:49) treated badly they should not be abused none of these things should happen dominions the same way that sequence of
(36:56) not granting them those rights it's not a consequence of that you don't have to beat a woman because he can't vote
(37:01) that's stupid no that I I'm saying that's a consequence of not being allowed power
(37:07) in the in uh the political system or the legal system no it's not if women don't
(37:12) have right to vote if women don't so men are just gonna start raping and pillaging women because women don't have
(37:18) rights that men already gave them like who do you think gives it men give
(37:24) them the rights to begin with they they're benevolent enough to give them the rights to begin with do you think that people who have mothers and they
(37:30) have daughters men who have mothers and daughters just walk around abusing women no bro they don't do no yes no they
(37:39) don't yes they do no they don't you don't think men abuse they're they're funny I didn't say that there's not
(37:44) there's not people who do abuse it happens but it happens from women on men too
(37:49) okay the the um especially egregious physical abuse
(37:55) uh that's almost entirely coming from men so yeah there's sits on children yeah unless it's on children and then
(38:02) it's mostly perpetrated by women uh I don't know about that well it is
(38:07) true 55 55 of all child abuse is conducted by women and not men okay
(38:13) that's interesting but um in in any case then that would also mean 45 of the
(38:19) abuse is coming from men so that's irides like that doesn't mean it's commonplace
(38:27) why would that mean it's commonplace that doesn't follow just because you look at the stat and
(38:32) you can break down the percentage of who conducts a crime doesn't mean the crime is common that's absurd
(38:37) um okay so family abuse is extremely common
(38:45) um well in physical abuse yeah no that would be extremely common no it's not let me see
(38:51) um percentage of children who experience physical abuse yeah but I want this to
(38:58) find as to what is considered physical abuse so approximately one in four
(39:04) children experience child abuse or neglect in their lifetime I want physical abuse yeah of maltreated uh
(39:10) children 18 are abused physically 78 are neglected nine percent are abused
(39:15) sexually so that is out of uh 25 so if
(39:22) 18 of 25 are abused um you you can do the the quick math
(39:30) there I think that's about five percent roughly okay so that's still not a high number
(39:35) just so you know that that is a pretty high number five I know no that would be one in 20. so so these are people one
(39:43) and twenty I said physical abuse whatever I don't know what these other things mean I don't know what neglect is
(39:50) how do they define neglect explained I I well I didn't I mentioned physical abuse
(39:55) specifically it'd be roughly five percent one in 20 is is low to you well
(40:00) I don't believe it's one in 20. you haven't defined the terms of what constitutes abuse well I I mentioned physical abuse
(40:07) specific language yeah but I don't know what that means what is considered physical because that would be that that would be physical hitting
(40:15) slack yeah but hitting is not physical abuse how is hitting not physical abuse okay
(40:20) there may be times where you need to make a correction especially with a child which is an important correction
(40:25) in order to spare them additional pain uh that they would not ordinarily have like for instance Don't touch don't put
(40:32) your finger in the light socket Johnny and you smack Johnny's hands so that he remembers that's not to put his finger
(40:37) in the light socket what's that that's that's not physical abuse of course not shoving so if I were to shove somebody
(40:44) out of the way like if they're going to be hit by a car um like that would be an analogous
(40:50) example right so I believe that spanking I believe that spanking which is often introduced as a prism of abuse inside of
(40:57) these studies it is not abuse it is it's not it's proven Corrections using
(41:02) corporal punishment using corporal punishment against a child has been proven to be bad in every conceivable
(41:10) way yeah by people have no children what do I hear what they say yeah yeah
(41:15) sorry uh are you're relying on your own personal anecdote well I hit my kids and they turned out good you're relying on
(41:21) your own personal anecdote the only thing you're saying is that which is what's the proof that people's opinions are that if you
(41:29) spank a child that the correction doesn't work okay sorry do you think prospective cohorts are less reliable
(41:36) than your own personal anecdotal experience not just my personal anecdotal experience people have been using the cane on children since the
(41:42) time before time for God this is insane so I got insane of course
(41:48) there's nothing wrong with spanking yes there is and no there's not possibly according to prospective cohorts
(41:54) children who get spanked or caned or any sort of uh corporal punishment is used
(42:00) as like a send me the study sure like um any any sort of corporal punishment
(42:07) that's used against uh children okay and so here's the research that
(42:15) shows that smacked kids do better in life and I'll send that over to you a study
(42:22) has found that kids smacked until about the age six turn out better not only do they tend to do better at school but
(42:27) they also likely do do well for themselves later in life as compared to the kids who've never been spanked by
(42:33) their parents yeah that's uh hard for me to believe but more harm than good summary of
(42:40) scientific research on the intended and unintended effects of corporal punishment in children
(42:45) um I don't know if you want me to send you that but it's a by the way it's a troll it's a troll study I'm joking okay sure but
(42:53) um in in any case if you look at the aggregate
(42:58) um the aggregate research children who are who receive a corporal punishment as
(43:05) means of correcting Behavior so smacking spanking caning whipping belts they do
(43:12) poorer in pretty much every metric uh they're less likely to complete school
(43:17) they're more likely to be depressed uh as far as relationships in the future
(43:23) they're less likely to have long-term meaningful relationships let's assume for a second I make a
(43:30) concession for all of this that spanking children is by far the absolute worst way that you can correct children what
(43:37) does that have to do with the fact that men grant women rights well we were so we went off course a
(43:44) little bit but you you were basically saying that um on the basis that men grant women rights
(43:51) you are assuming that men are in general uh benevolent yes
(43:58) in general are benevolent and well if you may not really so you think if we make a law tomorrow that says that
(44:04) murder is legal well I would concede that murder will increase are you just assuming that men are just going to
(44:09) start murdering with wild abandoned they have no self-control they have no virtue they have no nothing would you start
(44:14) murdering people Richard no one well yeah I probably would actually yeah you probably would so maybe it's it may be
(44:20) the reason you think the way that you do is because of the way that you are well no
(44:26) um so no one is entirely benevolent uh there are people who do mostly good but
(44:34) um do do some bad things and I think if you were able to appear into people's personal lives people that you thought
(44:41) were really nice uh may not treat their families or their wives or spouse uh
(44:47) with as much respect as you'd appreciate so so I'm digging into this by the way
(44:52) in the living situation with the highest odds of significant abuse is when children live with their mother and her
(44:57) male partner who's not the biological father right okay so biological fathers aren't running
(45:04) around probably very often abusing their children that's not a that's not uh
(45:09) that's not the case in point here when you start to dig into this it turns out that women women seem to be the problem
(45:14) here more than the men once again no you just admitted it's the men
(45:20) committee no I didn't in fact I told you the child abuse rates for women are
(45:25) higher than men you you literally just showed me a statistic where men are the perpetrators I didn't say that men were
(45:32) the perpetrators I said the highest likelihood of abuse is when the biological father's not present in the home yes and when the woman has a male
(45:40) partner so that doesn't mean the male partner is perfect that doesn't mean the male Partners perpetuating the abuse if
(45:46) 55 of it's committed by the women Richard okay well that's a that's a separate statistic you're just conflating uh the different uh no the
(45:54) conflation would be by you that would be by relating the different sources that would be you completely
(46:00) no you just told me I never told you that men that the cause of the abuse is
(46:07) by the man you made that up you made it up so you're conflating I didn't come I didn't conflate anything
(46:14) okay in any case I I think we can agree that there is a significant enough rate
(46:22) of abuse against women and children perpetrated by men
(46:27) where you may want to include these people in the legal and political system why where
(46:33) because okay well if if men are like going to have complete dominion and you
(46:39) have a society where like again women do not have little to no recourse when it comes to them getting abused uh them
(46:47) getting graped that's very different things why do you
(46:52) mean they have no they have no recourse they can go to men and they can get recourse which is what they do right now
(46:57) right now if a woman's being abused and she she feels like her rights are impugned upon and she goes to court and
(47:05) the court rules in her favor who enforces her rights who do you think shows up do you think it's women who show up to enforce her rights do you
(47:11) think it's men who show up to enforce her rights this is well there are women who are police
(47:18) officers yeah the exceptions to the rules I I don't know how that's an exception
(47:23) there are female police yes there are female there's there's even female loggers but they're you know how many
(47:28) there are it's it's less than one percent I believe I don't know why that matters there are women who are responses because women are because men
(47:36) are responsible for the building of all infrastructure they're responsible for the building of how Society runs to keep
(47:42) the electrical grid up they keep the entire system in place not only is that one function of the of the uh
(47:49) enforcement of Rights but also they are the ones who are going to end up physically enforcing it they're going to
(47:55) physically enforce the rights of for women which is what they do now you you don't see a potential issue where if you
(48:04) have a society or when where men are generally indifferent to
(48:10) I don't know the plight or suffering of women where oh you got graped by your
(48:16) husband uh sure you did toots okay I'll I'll write down a report like you don't
(48:21) see an issue where of course that would be an immortal non-virtuous Society
(48:27) however well certainly this would have to do this this has nothing to do with whether or not the women are involved in
(48:33) the political system but how virtuous the men are how virtuous the men are why
(48:38) it absolutely does I think we don't have to listen to him now Richard we could just take rights away from women
(48:43) tomorrow I don't think if women um had a right to vote they could um vote in say police Chiefs their right
(48:51) to vote only exists because we give it I don't care that's Point like if women
(48:57) have a right to vote you don't think they'd have power to elect in they don't have their powers it's a faux power they
(49:03) don't have real power can you stop cutting me off you don't think if women had a right to vote there would be a
(49:08) greater likelihood of say police Chiefs uh Mayors politicians officials that are
(49:14) more sympathetic to their problems why would they be more sympathetic to their problems just because they could vote
(49:20) well I'm saying if women could vote they could elect in officials that would
(49:27) be more sympathetic to their problems and because women make up 50 of the population that would be a big motivator
(49:34) for certain politicians to actually be sympathetic as long as men allow them to
(49:41) vote sure yes but what I'm what I'm pointing out
(49:46) is you're probably going to see lower instances of certain people in society
(49:52) getting mistreated abused um not being considered if women have a
(49:59) right to vote no well that I dispute why would you see more abuse in society
(50:05) just based on the vote how much abuse do you think that there was pre-women Voting I don't understand a what why do
(50:11) you think that there was a show me prove demonstrate that there was significantly more abuse before women could vote okay
(50:17) sure um let me see
(50:22) um there there have been big changes in uh
(50:29) grape rates over time um let me see
(50:37) so that's not what I'm asking you for I'm asking you to demonstrate for me that
(50:43) men before women could vote in the United States we're just running around abusing [ __ ] women that's absurd why
(50:50) would they do that I don't know what you mean by that but you there have been reductions in
(50:55) [Music] um spousal abuse including uh that's because less people are getting married
(51:02) uh no no no no no this is uh this is this is rates uh per capita yeah I
(51:10) understand but even if it's per capita if you lessen the pool you're still gonna have less no yeah that's not how that works it is
(51:17) how it works no that's not how that works that is how it works that's not how that works okay so let me ask you let me ask you a
(51:23) question population if you only have a pool of five people
(51:30) who are going to get married okay five they're five groups and you you go ahead and you you take
(51:37) that group do you think that the per capita ratio of those five people is
(51:42) going to be the same as if you did 100 million do you think it's going to be the same across the board if all if all
(51:47) else is equal then yes all of us is never equal oh come on dude you could
(51:53) have you could have a situation where you have such a small sample size that
(51:59) uh like okay if you only have one couple versus Yeah a hundred million you're not
(52:05) going to see a a meaningfully um what do you think statistics started for
(52:12) spousal abuse um I'm not sure but yeah um well the
(52:17) thing is just that I don't think in the 1700s there was rampant abuse of women and I don't think in the 1800s there was
(52:22) rampant abusive women I don't know where you came up with the idea that there was
(52:28) um well I I don't know how you could figure that like again give me special evidence to
(52:36) the contrary well um what's the figure like one in five
(52:41) women in their lifetime will likely be a victim of a sexual assault of some of
(52:47) some kind well they'll say they'll say that anyway
(52:53) okay well that's we could um say they're all liars right I'm not
(53:00) saying they're all liars I'm just saying right we all Based on self-reported data well okay well this isn't just based on
(53:09) self-reporting this is the one in four would be based on self-reporting if
(53:14) you're just going to use police stats it's nowhere near that high well if you're looking purely based on
(53:22) um like FBI statistics I think that does correlate with the one in five figure show me lifetime lifetime one and show
(53:29) me that the FBI statistics show that one in five women report they've been sexually assaulted is [ __ ] well you
(53:36) also have to take and into into account um relatively small proportion of these
(53:42) attacks are actually reported so if you're only going to well then how do they know about if they're not reported
(53:48) again they're they use other methods of research too you mean like we're getting
(53:54) them to report how could they possibly know it without them being reported can you explain that to me again these aren't like you don't have to have
(54:00) perfectly 100 accurate um stats if we're I think we like this is for all crimes
(54:06) by the way um about 20 of like um like burglaries are reported roughly
(54:13) like 20 of homicides are reported like this is for all crime
(54:18) so um so you're just making estimates no it's not just an estimate well what
(54:26) I'm pointing out is these sorts of crimes are very common um they're common enough where you may
(54:32) want to include 50 of the population as part of the um legal and political
(54:39) system so that they could perhaps influence changes that benefit uh
(54:45) benefit themselves or society as a whole they're just particularly you're just all you're doing is adding an extra okay
(54:51) well they're just petitioning they're just petitioning patriarchal men again for their rights regardless if they can
(54:58) vote or not here's why if men collectively decide tomorrow that women can't vote they can't but if women
(55:03) decide tomorrow collectively that men can't vote we can that's the difference it's very simple
(55:09) okay about it and we can do whatever we want because that's just the way it's set up bro
(55:16) right uh that's why Nazi Germany happened that's not why would that be a Nazi principle almost every nation on
(55:23) planet Earth which are not Nazis had to use this principle bro
(55:28) this this isn't a principle I I don't know well you just well first of all hang on
(55:35) what do you mean it's not a principle you you claimed well you claimed this was just a purely descriptive
(55:42) um observation you're making so if it's no I didn't claim that formative claim I did claim a descriptor but I also gave
(55:48) you an ought my ought was due to Christian virtues Christian virtue ethics I don't believe that women should
(55:54) ever be abused by men I also believe that men have a responsibility a duty to
(56:00) step in and stop any type of abuse which is happening I believe that divorce for the cases of abuse is just fine and so
(56:07) does the church that I belong to the Orthodox Church they believe that that's true okay the only time that we would
(56:12) step in and it would be for like when people say irreconcilable differences like we just don't like each other's faces then we would probably try to step
(56:20) in and say something it's interesting you mentioned that that you belong to a patriarchal system that's known for
(56:26) rampant sexual abuse now oh you're not Catholic yeah I'm Orthodox
(56:32) yeah I agree with you on the Catholic Church however it's not any more rampant than it is in the public school system
(56:38) Richard um I'm not sure about that but it's not it was you know why do you know why that
(56:45) is it's because Predators go where their children are makes sense well sure um I'd like to see the statistics I I'm
(56:53) not so sure if that is the case I'd be very surprised in fact
(56:59) well no no I mean it is it is the case for sure for sure and you know you could just kind of Pull It in there's very few
(57:05) Catholics inside the United States of course you have this massive pool of kids who go to public school it's an all
(57:11) you can eat buffet for a sexual predator and sexual predators go where the victims are so that's why Public School
(57:16) uh sexual abuse is so rampant I don't know if it's as high as in the
(57:21) Catholic church but um I do know of some pretty crazy cases I think there's an entire uh School faculty in Los Angeles
(57:29) that had to be replaced because every single member was found to be involved in some uh Predator ring yeah that
(57:36) doesn't surprise me I'm not a Catholic but this aside let me be very specific here with what I'm saying I'm saying
(57:42) that men men are the grantors of All rights to women and that necessarily is
(57:47) always going to be true always everywhere and it is right now and they can take them away whenever
(57:52) they want and women have basically zero recourse except to reapply to men to get those rights again
(57:59) right well even if we were to accept that as true the point I'm making is
(58:06) there is sorry do you accept it as true I don't
(58:11) know if I entirely agree with that um to some extent I agree but um I don't
(58:17) entirely agree with it but um which part do you disagree with of that descriptor there there's a level of
(58:24) truth to it but uh I'm there's a level of dis truth like women do have an
(58:30) ability to fight for their rights like you will see like I mean look at some of the protests that are happening um in
(58:37) Europe and Ukraine and Russia oh yeah all the women who are in the street blowing [ __ ] up come on man it's all men
(58:44) for the most part I would say like 90 is men over there blowing [ __ ] out we could
(58:51) go with 80 but uh it's overwhelmingly men it is overwhelmingly men but women are also involved in this too but um the
(58:59) point the the big Point here is you have an interest in protecting women
(59:06) and children and say people who have a lack of power in society so you wouldn't
(59:12) you wouldn't want well children absolutely have a lack of power in society yeah so so but that doesn't mean
(59:19) you're specifically only talking about children as having a lack of power well
(59:25) they're like disabled people I'm sure you don't want them to get mistreated or abused like yeah that's correct I think
(59:31) that men have a virtuous duty to not do that yeah yeah sure so if you don't include these people in the political
(59:38) and legal system that opens them up to far more abuse like there's a reason why by the way there there's a reason why in
(59:46) a lot of these um police precincts there's there's a goal to have a certain amount of female
(59:52) officers it prevents um women like uh women uh female
(59:58) suspects from getting abused and taken advantage of it sure doesn't uh prevent those female officers from getting their
(1:00:04) asses kicked by male suspects very much does it well again you can uh you can arrange
(1:00:13) duties in a way that's beneficial for everybody right so what you have to do is you have to give them lighter duties
(1:00:19) because if they run into men they can't [ __ ] deal with it nearly as well far better equipped to be cops just admit
(1:00:25) that that's true that is true of course they're equipped to be soldiers they're better equipped for violence wait wait
(1:00:31) wait that's an interesting point you make yes men are more well equipped to commit violence and they're also much
(1:00:38) more sexually motivated the chances of a male officer sexually abusing a female
(1:00:43) suspect are much greater than a female officer sexually abusing a suspect yeah I can see that that's true but I think
(1:00:49) it's beside the point a cop's job as well Force law and it's going to be necessary that you have males do that if
(1:00:55) you had a female police force it'd be a joke but if you had an all-male please well again
(1:01:01) for it's clearly in the best interest of everybody to have a certain amount of female officers at least performing
(1:01:08) certain duties well I mean okay fair enough go ahead I'm sorry I'm not saying
(1:01:13) like I'm not saying women should do absolutely everything that a male
(1:01:18) officer does I think there are certain situations where you have very dangerous suspects where you would require a
(1:01:25) larger more intimidating man sure okay but like there are like what situation
(1:01:32) would would be better if you were dealing with any disgruntled man whether he was five foot one in drunk or six
(1:01:37) foot six and drunk that you wouldn't want to have a male officer on the scene rather than this well sure but you would
(1:01:42) prefer to have a female officer on scene say um searching a female suspect so that
(1:01:49) maybe he doesn't accuse the cop of raping her well this this has actually happened
(1:01:55) though it has I agree so that's fine we can have we can have let me let me just ask you this
(1:02:01) if the entire police department was male who was only allowed to be male period
(1:02:07) and you had another Police Department that was only allowed to be female which Police Department do you think would be
(1:02:14) better equipped to deal with crime foreign
(1:02:21) violent crime men would be better well I I would say for violent crime men would
(1:02:28) be better equipped uh for non-violent crimes I think women would be better equipped for the most part so which
(1:02:35) Police Department do you think would outperform the other one it depends but like let's say all things
(1:02:42) equal or things where are things equal they're both in high crime areas that's where they both are which one do you
(1:02:49) think is going to do better Richard like again I think they would be better at doing certain things so I think uh women
(1:02:55) would probably be better uh with non-violent crimes I think they'd probably
(1:03:00) um be able to talk to um the crimes that people care about the least the people the crimes that people
(1:03:06) generally care about absolutely the least writing tickets you want meter maids and writing tickets and [ __ ] like
(1:03:12) that I mean come on man well Andrew you have to be able to get along with the public and you do have to be able to get
(1:03:18) along with suspects and I've seen female officers be much less combative okay but
(1:03:25) men men are just fine skills especially with other men so great great I just
(1:03:31) want you to answer this honestly for me which department all things equal both in high crime areas which one do you
(1:03:37) think is going to perform better the all-male police force are the all-female
(1:03:42) I I don't know what you consider performing well like if you mean by
(1:03:48) making more of more crimes sorry solve more crimes and put more suspects in
(1:03:54) jail it would it would probably be the male Force yeah
(1:03:59) um but again um that's not the point I'm making so the
(1:04:05) point I'm making is you have some vulnerable individuals the vulnerable individuals in this case being women
(1:04:12) um with a man like with an all-male police force if you have men
(1:04:18) interviewing um women who are claiming to have been uh
(1:04:23) victims of grape you're going to see a much higher likelihood of them not being taken
(1:04:30) seriously um and you can see this in every industry by the way this is a big problem in the healthcare industry where
(1:04:36) women will report having pain to a male doctor and male doctors are less likely
(1:04:43) to take them seriously and give them appropriate diagnosis diagnoses and medication this is across all Industries
(1:04:49) so when you when you have issues like this that can be systemic where men just do
(1:04:57) not take women's issues seriously then I guess they can just vote to make them take them seriously well yes
(1:05:04) they're gonna vote so they're going to vote you need to take me seriously and have men they're going to force my
(1:05:10) rights they have men come in and tell other men they have to take me seriously they're going to happen right stuff man
(1:05:16) you have to contend with 50 of the population and men have always contended
(1:05:21) with 50 of the population it hasn't been problematic for us to do ever okay well when you're running as an elected
(1:05:28) official and you have a potential to capture 50 of the votes that is a unless
(1:05:35) they can't vote Yes and that's what I'm arguing for if you you're going to have a huge um
(1:05:43) you're going to have a huge incentive yeah and then you also end up with disproportionation the other the other
(1:05:49) way right it's disproportionate the other way when you get into court for instance how do you think you would fare
(1:05:54) if you got a divorce tomorrow do you think that you would do better than your wife
(1:06:00) I have no idea what I mean what do you think on average do you think your chances are better than hers of walking
(1:06:06) away with the ferris deal probably yeah you think on average that that's true
(1:06:13) um I don't know like when you're talking like okay by the way when you're talking about like huge alimony payments [ __ ]
(1:06:19) like that um you're usually talking about really rich people oh no I'm not just talking about rich people I'm just
(1:06:24) talking about even dividing up assets when you have lawyers involved the court favors women overwhelmingly it
(1:06:31) disproportionately in fact and because men are so benevolent and we are benevolent we have gone out of our way
(1:06:37) to kind of pamper women to keep them away from all the Rough and Tumble we keep them away from the hardship we keep
(1:06:43) them away from that and so most of our laws favor women to the point that even in the criminal justice system if it
(1:06:50) comes to a woman being prosecuted for the exact same crime as a man the man gets a worse punishment
(1:06:57) yes uh yeah I would agree with that yeah so we're we're all we're clearly benevolent we're clearly pretty [ __ ]
(1:07:03) benevolent well again well it's funny you mentioned that do you think a a woman is going to be more sympathetic to
(1:07:11) a female criminal than a man is going to be sympathetic to a female doesn't seem
(1:07:16) to be the case well I would imagine a female judge is
(1:07:22) going to be less sympathetic to a female criminal you can imagine that all you want but it's not demonstrated in our courts
(1:07:29) um I don't know if it is um I'd have to look up some of the research on that but um I I will agree
(1:07:36) with you uh female criminals are treated better in the criminal justice system they do
(1:07:42) get lower uh sentencing even though they're at the complete mercy of the patriarchy well yes but that means the patriarchy
(1:07:50) that's pretty compelling evidence the patriarchy is pretty [ __ ] benevolent towards women Richard well in that case
(1:07:56) in that particular case what cases are they they don't log they don't put up the electrical grid they don't they
(1:08:03) don't do the infrastructure they don't do the auto mechanics they don't work in the medical Fields other than as nurses
(1:08:09) but they don't invent most of the technology for that at what point are you going to look at this and be like look men are pretty benevolent
(1:08:18) no I that's not what I said I said the invention of the equipment in the medical field almost all men almost all
(1:08:25) Engineers for applied science are men almost all loggers are men your roads are constructed by men your
(1:08:31) infrastructure is constructed by men your buildings are constructed by men women have very little to do with any of
(1:08:36) this at all and they seem to be really [ __ ]
(1:08:42) benevolent about the fact that they do all of that horrific brutal [ __ ] work and still give women less punishment for
(1:08:48) the same crime that men have because nobody gives a [ __ ] about men including men
(1:08:54) [Music] um give me a second
(1:09:08) okay um I I would agree that yeah men do most of
(1:09:16) the like hard physical labor they work more um not just hard physical labor
(1:09:22) right when it comes to the invention the intervention even even the invention
(1:09:28) which is maybe not hard-skilled labor but why do you think that is that we're in these positions where we're far more
(1:09:34) likely to die across the board for almost every job or suicide rates are through the roof in comparison to women
(1:09:39) through the roof well women are more likely to experience depression and
(1:09:44) attempt suicide men are more likely to actually um be successful we're just better at it
(1:09:50) you think it's yeah we as men are better at it we're yeah we're just talking about everything bro come on we're just
(1:09:57) better at [ __ ] well we are better at committing suicide right because we're better at everything well men are more
(1:10:02) likely to use a gun women are more likely to use non-violent means to commit suicide but it's because do you
(1:10:08) know why that is it's because most women don't know how to use a [ __ ] gun no no it's because women prefer less
(1:10:14) violent means of suicide um but anyway
(1:10:20) the the the point I'm making is if you allow like 50 of the population to be
(1:10:28) involved in the uh political system you're going to see a benefit for that portion of the
(1:10:35) population like there's a reason why we want representation in our democratic
(1:10:41) system um so like it there are female specific problems that um I don't think a lot of
(1:10:48) men either understand or care about what um I I don't know okay like women have their
(1:10:54) own sorts of um priorities interests uh like child care I'm sure is a big one
(1:11:01) um you don't have no men don't understand the interest in child care like how dumb do you think men might
(1:11:06) have as much of an interest well how I gotta ask you this how stupid do you think men who you just conceded create
(1:11:11) the entire infrastructure for which women live in but yet somehow we don't have the capacity to understand that
(1:11:17) there could be specific women's issues that need to be addressed by us because it seems like we know that just fine and
(1:11:23) we seem to be very benevolent when we even hand out judgment towards women we almost seem to you know uh infantilize
(1:11:30) them or infantilize them sorry and finalize them right we treat them like almost babies like if if you beat up a
(1:11:36) man and a man beats up a man and they do the same amount of damage the woman just kind of walks and the dude he gets put
(1:11:42) in [ __ ] prison okay if um we're going to
(1:11:48) if we're going to just say they shouldn't have any sort of political say because we understand them well enough
(1:11:54) anyway like are is that an argument foreign
(1:12:02) my argument is that they only have a say anyway because we give them one yes they
(1:12:08) only can vote anyway because so it's always an appeal to men no matter what uh okay I'll agree to that I I don't
(1:12:15) think there's nothing more to discuss point the point is this would still be
(1:12:21) in your interest if you care about protecting women um and women's issues so you would have
(1:12:29) an interest in allowing women to vote if you have an interest in making sure
(1:12:34) women are well treated in society okay but seemingly
(1:12:40) women are very well treated in society even though they live under a patriarchy right
(1:12:47) um for the most part but yeah again there there are specific for the most part so
(1:12:54) where are all these crazy [ __ ] like Max men on the back of cars with playing
(1:12:59) their [ __ ] metal guitar with their guns just waiting to enslave them that they don't exist bro they've never
(1:13:04) existed men don't treat women like that okay should black people have never uh been granted a right to vote because
(1:13:11) again after the abolition of slavery You could argue well compared to at least
(1:13:16) other countries black people are treated fairly well right every single time this comes up men give men rights men gave
(1:13:23) well they didn't need to give black people right well and if you reverse that men wouldn't have needed to give
(1:13:29) white people rights if if it was uh the roles were reversed it doesn't matter which way you cut it the difference is
(1:13:35) is that blacks in certain instances took up arms and they fought off slavers and
(1:13:41) they they literally had Wars against entire plantations they could no they didn't yes they did yeah go ahead and
(1:13:48) name them what yeah name the great woman slave uprising of never [ __ ] happened Richard
(1:13:54) um what the [ __ ] here Harriet Tubman Harriet Tubman ran at the Underground Railroad she was not a combatant she was
(1:14:02) not fighting she killed people I don't even know she killed people I don't even
(1:14:07) think she did I don't even think that that's correct yeah she go ahead and show me she did she at least was accused of it but she was known for having
(1:14:14) um killed slavers so it's that sounds like uh okay well I
(1:14:20) mean whatever even if she did she killed two slavers or four let's say she killed 20. let's say she was the Terminator
(1:14:26) with a rifle and she just like mowed down 20 slavers so [ __ ] what the
(1:14:31) slave uprisings were men they were men and their men were the ones who fought in the wars which is what uh essentially
(1:14:38) from the revolution on uh black soldiers were always in the front line it was one of the ways that they demonstrated that
(1:14:45) they were the equal to right uh to to white soldiers they would in World War II blacks would line up knowing that the
(1:14:52) Army was going to segregate them because they wanted to demonstrate that they were just as good as the white soldiers
(1:14:59) men can give themselves rights they can take themselves out of bondage women can't do it okay
(1:15:06) yeah um I'm looking this up apparently there's a woman named Emily in Pankhurst who is a women's suffragette who killed
(1:15:13) five people but in in any case this isn't about whether women would take up
(1:15:18) a violent arms like this is about your interest and who enforces their rights sorry then who enforces her rights if
(1:15:25) they're not going to take up men do just like how many and that's it that's the end of it bro yes that's right black men
(1:15:32) enforced black rights okay that's correct I I'm just I like I I'm just wondering you're saying if
(1:15:40) somebody has good enough placing in society where they're not for the most
(1:15:45) part getting abused mistreated you would not really be in favor of granting them rights because who cares
(1:15:52) no that's incorrect well now you're moving into an ought
(1:15:58) from the descriptor of what's true so what we've just been arguing over whether or not the descriptor is true
(1:16:04) and in this case we can't even agree on the descriptor except we just finally did where you finally conceded yes all
(1:16:11) of everybody's rights comes from men and it's like okay if we could concede on that descriptor that I think we can move
(1:16:18) on to the odds can you can see that that's true finally that all rights for all people at all times come from Men
(1:16:26) I don't entirely agree on that but um well then if we don't agree on the descriptor I'm saying why I don't
(1:16:33) entirely well these are two unrelated like the they're Loosely related I don't
(1:16:38) entirely agree on that but I'd say for the most part sure most rights are
(1:16:43) granted or enforced by men name one that's not well again women make up 50 of society
(1:16:51) uh they have enough even if they can't be for the most part a physical threat
(1:16:57) because they make up 50 of society um I'm sure some rights are made in the
(1:17:03) interest of women yes but so you're just you're just back
(1:17:09) to square one what right I'm at this is my question to you and I've asked it to you multiple times name a right women
(1:17:17) give themselves I I mean like I I don't even understand
(1:17:22) how this is that's not granted to them by men yeah
(1:17:29) like it's just a weird thing to say like name one like I don't care to make this Division I could make this division on
(1:17:36) any basis name one right that gingers give themselves well like if they're men
(1:17:42) if they're men and they live in Scotland they can give themselves rights well again you're just arbitrarily making I
(1:17:48) don't think it's arbitrary I think it's no it's just a deductio so I'm just deducing that men seem to be the foundation for
(1:17:56) All rights because they're the enforcement arm you haven't made a single argument yet for how that's not true you just agree and say but I don't
(1:18:02) fully agree but you can't tell me the portion that you don't fully agree with what is the portion you don't fully
(1:18:08) agree with what is it well you're making this like strange
(1:18:15) arbitrary separation between uh sex or gender when you can make this separation
(1:18:22) in any way you could you can make Gingers and non-gingers like it's just a little strange
(1:18:29) um and I'm I mean yeah most political systems are for the most part run by men
(1:18:34) so when you're talking about what gets enacted into law yeah it's going to be men for the most
(1:18:40) part who pass these laws but at least in our society there are women who are
(1:18:45) involved in the political system and have like those are allowed right but like I mean I I don't see a
(1:18:51) situation where men are all gonna like you know get up one morning and say hey do you all just want to subjugate women
(1:18:57) more today and then like kick every woman woman out of the house floor matriarchy Marjorie Taylor green so then
(1:19:05) the patriarchy so the patriarchy is benevolent you're going to concede on that too I'm not saying they're benevolent I I'm
(1:19:11) is it's just a weird and why why is it that women don't or men don't just get up one morning and enslave all women
(1:19:18) even though we could and you know we could and you've admitted that we could why don't we do that isn't it because
(1:19:24) well it's a generally speaking at least in modern society we have an interest in
(1:19:30) not like [ __ ] making lives horrible for each other but because men are benevolent we could do it but we don't
(1:19:37) what men are benevolent men are the ones who commit the most amount of violent crimes doesn't wouldn't change any facts
(1:19:44) even if men committed 100 of the violent crimes we could tomorrow and you would agree with this tell me if I'm wrong
(1:19:51) about this let's say 100 of men woke up tomorrow morning and said we're going to
(1:19:56) enslave 100 of women they could but if women woke up tomorrow morning and 100 of them said we're going to enslave men
(1:20:03) they could not do you agree or disagree sure so then so then the fact the fact
(1:20:08) that we don't form into monoliths which has been done all over by the way all over the world has been done many many
(1:20:15) times in history and even right now there's some uh countries which Grant no rights to women and they can't do
(1:20:20) anything it seems to allude to the fact that especially in Christian nations men seem to be pretty [ __ ] benevolent if
(1:20:27) it's so benevolent in fact that we give lesser sentences for the same crimes dude
(1:20:32) yeah so like again that's one particular circumstance where women are benefited
(1:20:41) and again you're like I would say if you're talking about a public scenario
(1:20:46) where like I don't know some drunk dumbass [ __ ] woman hits a man uh versus
(1:20:51) like same person hits a woman you're probably going to see like a woman beat
(1:20:57) up The Other Woman uh right like I'd say a woman is probably more likely to be
(1:21:03) comfortable in engaging in a fight with another woman versus a man engaging in a fight with a woman so like again when
(1:21:11) you include more women in the political and legal system you might see those sorts of biases go away where women are
(1:21:19) are granted like this extra leniency because men think women are like [ __ ]
(1:21:24) stupid 12 year old children who shouldn't be held accountable or again men have certain biases like we like
(1:21:32) pretty girls if you see a pretty criminal that's going to have a greater bias than if you see an ugly criminal
(1:21:37) and actually um you've seen this played out um quite a few times in a high profile uh female
(1:21:44) abuse cases where you can look up some of these stories
(1:21:49) pretty young female teacher raped grapes a male student
(1:21:54) she gets off of the slap on the wrist I've seen ugly fat chicks who were older
(1:22:00) because nobody cares about men man and here's it's not that nobody cares about
(1:22:05) men the point I'm making is men have men have specific biases and if you include
(1:22:12) more women in in these political and legal systems you're going to see some of these biases go away and you're going
(1:22:18) to see a bit of a flattening all it shows again is our benevolence you haven't made no it doesn't you haven't
(1:22:24) made an argument about how we're not benevolent in fact even when even when women are committing the same crime of
(1:22:31) assaulting children we still are still a plant that we don't that an act of
(1:22:36) benevolence to let a criminal basically walk with a slap on her wrist that's not an act of benevolence towards the
(1:22:41) criminal wouldn't you agree no no that's no it's not it's an act of malevolence
(1:22:46) towards the criminal what do you mean well that's that's a decision that would favor the interests
(1:22:53) of the criminal but I wouldn't call that a benevolent action well what else would you call it you could say it would be in
(1:22:58) the best interest of the criminal being rehabilitated or taken away from society or benevolent towards women which is my
(1:23:04) entire Point again and again how's that not being benevolent towards women of course it is like here I'll demonstrate
(1:23:09) this I'll demonstrate this I want you to with a straight face because I don't believe that you can do it tell me that
(1:23:16) you believe that it's the same exact thing when a 15 year old has sex with a
(1:23:22) 20 year old you know hot teacher and a 15 year old girl has sex with a 20 year old male teacher that you believe that
(1:23:30) this affects both of them the same way okay the okay so 15 year old student
(1:23:36) male female 20 year old teacher male female yeah that's what you're talking about yeah and you believe it affects
(1:23:41) them the same way go ahead and lie to me and tell me you think it does
(1:23:47) yeah I already know bro like I know I know you know PF young knows like we
(1:23:54) all know I would say in general no it doesn't affect them the same way uh it
(1:23:59) doesn't mean um it doesn't mean uh men and women shouldn't be held to
(1:24:05) the same standards or like it's not harming the victim if you have an interest if you have an
(1:24:12) interest in holding men and women to the same standards again it would benefit you to include
(1:24:19) men and women in the legal and political system because again if you have a male judge who has a bias for liking pretty
(1:24:26) girls and he sees a pretty 20 year old who's accused of you know graping a male
(1:24:33) student he's less likely to take that seriously compared to a woman who doesn't have that bias for pretty girls
(1:24:41) well yeah I mean but that's just kind of like that's just baked into the hypothetical as being a truism so I would concede
(1:24:48) that's true but I don't think it really contends with the point that a when you're talking about them their right to
(1:24:53) vote I just kind of still need you to concede that not only do we give them
(1:24:59) the right to do that but we're also pretty benevolent to them after they have the right to do that and we don't
(1:25:04) take the right away and there's no rights there are no rights out there that women as a collective body give
(1:25:11) themselves they're given to them by men and you kind of have said I I kind of tangentially agree with or disagree with
(1:25:17) that or I kind of in some ways disagree with that but I haven't actually seen the disagreement yet like I mean you
(1:25:24) could say the same thing about black people disabled people there are minority groups who have no ability you
(1:25:31) couldn't say but you couldn't say that about black people because black men have fought for their own rights and
(1:25:38) they have been successful in many cases physically no they haven't yes they have no the only reason slave were free it
(1:25:45) was because I'm not talking about just uh slavery which was a
(1:25:51) um well I mean I think at first if there had been slave rebellions they would have been able to do it but later on there was a number issue but even if you
(1:25:58) go to the British Empire the British fought with the Zulu the Zulu tribes the Zulu absolutely decimated oh after they
(1:26:05) won Victory after Victory so the thing is though is that they were still able to fight they were still able to cause a
(1:26:11) problem they were still able to do something to enforce their rights yeah they were the females the women where
(1:26:18) was the women Zulu warriors where were they bro the only reason uh the Zulu were able to
(1:26:24) have some small victories was because the British didn't use machine guns because they thought it was
(1:26:30) ungentlemanly that's it once they once they just used machine guns they were
(1:26:37) absolutely [ __ ] yeah they were devastated by other men's technology I get it but where were the women who were
(1:26:43) rushing the British with spear in hand and shield in hand
(1:26:49) willing to die to Grant themselves right well look at the [ __ ] World War II
(1:26:54) Russia you know how many women there was even um the fighting girlfriend uh tank
(1:27:00) commander so like what are you talking about there were outliers they weren't outliers they were outliers they were
(1:27:06) outliers yeah in comparison to the Russian to the Red Army which was comprised of 90 like 90 or 95 percent
(1:27:13) men they had some female snipers they had some female Espionage agents and females are great for Espionage in the
(1:27:20) military but they're not great as Fighters and that's the whole problem with enforcement bro well it's kind of
(1:27:26) interesting you say that too because um you don't think say Espionage or um
(1:27:33) building machinery a lot of women were uh a lot of women were working in these factories like you know they weren't
(1:27:39) building machinery that's not that's not great here's what happened no they weren't well they didn't design the Machinery but not only that they're
(1:27:45) building equipment no they worked in a process that was invented by men a factorial process it was invented by men
(1:27:52) they stood on a line and they put a [ __ ] part on a bomb that's what they did they weren't inventing new military
(1:27:58) technology they weren't inventing new factories they weren't inventing new tanks they weren't inventing new [ __ ]
(1:28:04) nothing they were sitting on a line and they were putting a screw in a pack bro okay that's what they were doing
(1:28:10) oh okay but again the the main I we keep
(1:28:16) getting back to this but the main point I'm making is if you have an interest in ensuring the well-being of say women
(1:28:24) or children or somebody who doesn't have much political power
(1:28:30) um you would have an interest in allowing them to be part of the political system because again they can
(1:28:38) make political decisions and vote in a way in which that protects or benefits them I don't feel like you've
(1:28:43) demonstrated that I I don't know how the hell I haven't demonstrated that like what what is the interest that you have
(1:28:49) in voting well me personally I don't think that voting is even the best system to be
(1:28:54) honest with you well but I I think that it's a patriarchal system now and that's necessarily always going to be a
(1:29:01) patriarchal system and that extending the right to women to vote yeah go ahead wait why do men have an interest in in
(1:29:08) voting oh well many men don't have an interest in voting but if you're just talking
(1:29:14) about um why is it that why the normal joke goes and votes it's because they think
(1:29:20) that it's going to affect some sort of change that they want to see that's non-violent so why would you not grant that to women
(1:29:28) like yeah whether whether we granted it to women or not it's kind of beside the point it's if we granted it to women
(1:29:33) what are these huge distinctions in society you think you would see that are worse
(1:29:40) okay well you could say that would be true of men so yeah that's right except that men could change that system and
(1:29:47) women can't that's my whole point okay but so if men feel like it's something equally yoked they can be like [ __ ] you
(1:29:53) this would apply to men as well so please explain to me well it doesn't
(1:29:59) what would change doesn't apply women it would it would apply to men which thing which thing would apply voting if you're
(1:30:06) gonna say voting doesn't benefit women then why would it benefit men so here's the thing
(1:30:11) it benefits men unless men decide they no longer want to vote and they just
(1:30:16) want there not to be a vote anymore and then then they decide in a brand new system so if the men decide they want
(1:30:22) communism there's going to be communism they decide they want to be socialism is going to be socialism capitalism is going to be capitalism women can't do
(1:30:29) that that's the distinction you understand it doesn't matter if they can or can't do that well I think it does
(1:30:34) because it's a farce you you haven't explained if you're going to say women don't have the
(1:30:39) benefit uh when it comes to voting then how could men have the benefit when it comes to voting well man well I'm saying
(1:30:46) they could both have the benefit but only one of them can actually affect change if it's bias or there's problems
(1:30:51) or there's any issue and that's going to be the men so it's still waiting
(1:30:57) it's just still men granting them the Rights Voting or not voting whether they vote or they don't vote
(1:31:04) no benefit to voting for anybody uh I mean I guess in in you mean like in
(1:31:12) current Democratic systems yeah yeah I would say that there's definitely uh
(1:31:17) benefit probably in voting in current Democratic systems what's your point so then why wouldn't you allow women if you
(1:31:22) agree voting is a benefit well it's a benefit to men who are the in charge of
(1:31:28) the patriarchal structure because they implemented voting women didn't Implement that they were granted that
(1:31:34) and then as we see they've been granted that they can't actually enforce it for themselves men have to enforce it on
(1:31:40) their behalf and right there we are at an hour and a half
(1:31:45) and I will just say I'm very glad I did not just step in at all by the way that was just super super fun
(1:31:51) debate dude thanks for coming on man I enjoyed it bro I enjoyed it a lot me as well and I had to do the hardest
(1:31:57) part moderate uh we're gonna go into the Q a section now and then we'll do that for an hour and a
(1:32:04) half and then we'll do closing statements is everyone on board with that yeah so uh
(1:32:09) if you guys want to call um remember that that uh PF is here is a
(1:32:15) um a guest moderator but he has control of how the this is going to go I'm just bringing callers on and off
(1:32:21) um there are super chats and PF you can see those have all been marked under the starred as callers fill up if you hop in
(1:32:28) the Discord Zen Shapiro will get you a link uh or Rachel will get you a link and then you can call in we already have
(1:32:34) some callers in the background uh but PF if you want to start with the super chats that would be appreciated
(1:32:40) sure I cannot pull them up on screen I'll pull them up for you don't worry okay just start reading oh excellent I
(1:32:45) have the easiest job all right Yukon Cornelius 4.99 Gaines would you mind defining you know
(1:32:52) what we didn't get closing statements bro I thought we'd do closing statements after q a no no we do closing statements
(1:32:57) then we go to q a okay well we'll do closing statements and then go to q a so okay well I'm
(1:33:02) gonna give I'm going to give uh Richard the last word because uh he opened so
(1:33:08) I'll go ahead and close first so surprisingly enough or maybe not surprisingly
(1:33:14) uh for most of the people in the audience uh myself and peaking games honestly didn't have that much to
(1:33:20) disagree about I think that he basically agrees that everything I'm saying is descriptively true and I think if we
(1:33:25) moved into the odds from that he would kind of have to concede on many of those too and as we got into some of those he
(1:33:30) basically ended up conceding on many of them um I do think it was a great sport for
(1:33:36) coming on and I always like to uh engage with him he's always been he's always been good on The Crucible I don't know
(1:33:42) there's all these [ __ ] people like Richard's gonna cause all kinds of he's always been a great sport a year I don't know what the [ __ ] problem is but
(1:33:47) anyway um so I I think I think descriptively he essentially agreed with uh with
(1:33:54) everything that I said and he couldn't really give me a counter argument on any of the things that I pushed him on so
(1:34:01) uh you know as it stands right now until I hear good counter arguments or I hear
(1:34:06) really good alternative descriptors um I would have to say that the world
(1:34:12) view that I espouse is 100 correct um and until I hear arguments the contrary that's really all I have on my
(1:34:20) closing and uh just to thank my opponent again for so graciously coming on I appreciate that very much
(1:34:27) all right well as far as my closing statement so Andrew's sort of right
(1:34:33) um I do agree with him to some extent that yeah like ultimately um it is like a man's world so to speak
(1:34:41) um if men as a collective decided to take away all women's rights sure we could do that
(1:34:47) um we hold more power in society uh we have more guns I guess
(1:34:52) the the thing is though um what I don't agree with on that point is that both men and women are involved
(1:35:00) in the political system whether it be Democratic or otherwise there are women who are involved in say violent
(1:35:07) uprisings there are women who are involved in Warfare so I don't totally agree with this point
(1:35:13) um I but I do mostly agree there but what um interests me more
(1:35:20) is if we do have an interest in better benefiting most members of society or
(1:35:27) protecting say vulnerable groups of people like women children what have you uh we should try to include them in our
(1:35:35) political and legal system it not only gives them the ability to influence
(1:35:41) political and and legal changes that benefit them but I think it can also
(1:35:46) benefit us as well it does help to remove certain biases from these systems
(1:35:52) it introduces New Perspectives that may be better than our own
(1:35:59) um so I think we shouldn't really focus too much on whether or not somebody's big and strong enough and has a big big
(1:36:06) gun to fight and uh I don't know overtake the government if it becomes
(1:36:12) tyrannical I think we should also consider um you know what people can what certain
(1:36:18) people can do women included when we add them to the political system let them vote
(1:36:24) and allow them to not only make uh decisions that can benefit them and protect them in particular but um could
(1:36:30) also benefit us in some ways there you go
(1:36:37) that's where PF young says I appreciate that closing statement very much excellent well we do things a little bit differently on The Crucible we do do
(1:36:43) things a little differently on The Crucible yes so as we go through these the moderator can participate
(1:36:49) um that's fine the debate is considered closed we're going to start by going through super chats after we get done with the super chats we will move over
(1:36:56) to callers we do it in that order because uh these are essentially paying customers and you callers why we
(1:37:02) appreciate you um we we do want to take care of the super chats first so
(1:37:07) um go ahead PF when you're ready yeah speaking games would you mind defining what a woman is are there any biological
(1:37:12) markers follow-up did you say you would that a trans woman a while back
(1:37:19) so um women I a woman I'd say uh can have
(1:37:25) two definitions could be somebody who is born with a sex characteristics that are
(1:37:33) female both primary and secondary or it could be a person that was born
(1:37:40) um with a male sex at Birth who decides to transition and adopts
(1:37:46) enough physical traits that are aligned with
(1:37:52) uh what is typically found or seen in at in the female sex
(1:37:59) um so yeah there are biological markers for what a woman is but you don't necessarily need all of those biological
(1:38:06) markers I would say if you have enough characteristics that are associated with a female and you choose to identify
(1:38:13) as a woman um it would be fine to recognize that person as a woman
(1:38:19) and would I have sex with a trans woman um possibly like I'm married now to
(1:38:26) uh CIS woman but um if I found somebody attractive enough then sure I wouldn't
(1:38:32) have a problem necessarily
(1:38:38) great thanks for that made by Jim Bob the classic the original
(1:38:45) presuppositionalist Andrew if the disparity of strength between men and women is true why is there a dramatic
(1:38:50) increase of testicle injuries in women's sports [Laughter]
(1:38:57) well see see there's a there's a good explanation for this
(1:39:02) um it just so happens that Owen Benjamin has sex with men that's it that's my
(1:39:08) entire explanation for that that's that's all I have honestly epic yeah not
(1:39:15) the next one DHHS data Department of Health and Human Services data shows
(1:39:20) that 70.6 percent of children were abused by their mothers 29.4 by their fathers no question but perhaps
(1:39:26) something interesting to comment on well I'm going to be maximum charitable here um I didn't I don't expect vegan gains
(1:39:32) to like know this off top of his head um but the argument usually back the
(1:39:38) other way is that well yeah but this is because there's a lot more single mothers and this is why you would kind
(1:39:45) of expect to see that but that kind of goes against vegan gain's earlier argument about per capita and if you
(1:39:50) increase the pool you have different likelihoods right um but that's usually what the feminist
(1:39:56) argument back is so and I I would say unless he wants to kind of retract what
(1:40:01) he said on per capita he would just kind of have to agree that this stat is true yeah
(1:40:07) um I'd have to look at the stat but uh assuming it's true the discrepancy may
(1:40:14) be related to [Music] um not only single motherhood but mothers
(1:40:20) in general may spend more time with their children so um it's possible that you just see
(1:40:26) because there's more interaction between children and their mothers you just see higher rates of abuse what Andrew said though it has nothing
(1:40:33) to do with per capita rates um it's just that it if you were to say
(1:40:38) control for that confounding variable of time spent with children uh you may see
(1:40:45) it go the other way where fathers are more likely to abuse their children I have no idea well then the per capita
(1:40:51) rates would change that's the whole point that's what I'm saying so it's like well you know what I
(1:40:58) mean then the per capita rates would change if you enter if you introduce a new control then we would have different per capita rates
(1:41:06) well no it would just control for that confounding variable like you're talking about
(1:41:11) um well I mean wait wait a second
(1:41:18) um what do you think that that variable there is it's saying that 70.6 percent of children were abused by their mothers
(1:41:24) 29 by their fathers what do you think that this is do you think that this is
(1:41:30) um do you think that this stat is untrue can you account for it or I'm not saying
(1:41:35) it's untrue um I'm just saying I haven't looked at the stat and one of the confounding
(1:41:41) variables may be that women just spend more time with their children thus you see higher rates of abuse among women
(1:41:47) but in any case I would still say 30 is a very high amount one in three
(1:41:53) basically well then doesn't it logically follow that if you control for a new variable whatever the per capita stats
(1:42:00) are going to be are going to significantly change um [Music]
(1:42:06) you mean like children that are like How likely you are to be abused by your
(1:42:11) father versus mother yeah yeah that would have to be true once you introduce a new control and you have new data the
(1:42:17) per capita rates are going to have to change um
(1:42:25) yeah I suppose yeah I'm sorry uh this was the next one the
(1:42:30) unconventional man that was the one we just looked at oh I'm sorry you should be vegan this is not an
(1:42:38) attack against you but a criticism of how you debate excellent worth the ten dollars for
(1:42:43) advice your evidence your evidence in my opinion is one dimensional your entire case seems to rest on trying to get
(1:42:50) Andrew to support a particular kind of fruit
(1:42:57) um no my argument was based on the idea that Andrew has an interest in you know
(1:43:04) protecting women children or improving their lives in some way and a
(1:43:10) very easy way to do that is to grant them some amount of political power by
(1:43:16) voting uh it didn't have only to do with grape it could be anything
(1:43:24) right and kind of my counter to that is but we were pretty benevolent to women even before this even before they had
(1:43:31) the right to vote I don't see how their their right to vote has I I don't I don't see that's the thing is like if he
(1:43:37) if he could actually demonstrate for me something that was specific to women that they needed the right to vote because men just weren't going to Grant
(1:43:44) it to them and this was some right that um that men thought that they should have which they wouldn't have it now if
(1:43:51) men didn't think they would have it I'd like to hear what that is well
(1:43:57) um I I'd have to think about that a little more but um I I think just logically
(1:44:04) that makes sense to me got it cool
(1:44:11) did that come through on your end because I think that was um donated on my live stream does it
(1:44:18) filter into the same thing yeah they all filter in the same wow we want to get all the we want to get all the questions in regardless of if you're supporting
(1:44:25) Paul who did a great job moderating highly highly suggest you go Cinema super Chia he deserves one thank you
(1:44:31) thank you made five dollars tonight so a Saturday night well spent there's been a reduction in fruits over
(1:44:37) time because there has been unified men maybe uniformed men unified men to
(1:44:45) enforce the women's right including evidence Etc
(1:44:50) foreign yeah so that is true um you could also argue there has been a
(1:44:57) greater interest in reducing grapes because women have had voting rights and
(1:45:05) political power to increase that interest and on top of that women have also been allowed to join the police
(1:45:12) force in law enforcement and if you have more women in law enforcement roles
(1:45:18) you're probably going to see a greater interest in uh enforcing and solving these crimes so you could also make that
(1:45:24) argument
(1:45:31) yeah seems reasonable Circle G the sequel to Circle K has become a
(1:45:38) YouTube member congratulations welcome to the the club Frankie D for 1999 a good year huge
(1:45:46) Super Chat by the way thank you very much for supporting The Crucible we appreciate it very much absolutely
(1:45:51) sociology in my opinion is not a hard science because it attempts to diagnose infinitely complex problems such as
(1:45:57) quote rates of abuse which have potentially infinite factors involved not to mention the definition
(1:46:04) of abuse it's nonsense uh yeah all right go ahead if you want
(1:46:10) me to go first yeah so people use the sort of critique against literally any
(1:46:16) field of science practically um you're gonna find confounding variables in uh nutrition and Drug
(1:46:23) research too the amount of confounding variables just due to the fact that you're dealing with multiple human
(1:46:29) bodies that can react to your different medications in different ways is also
(1:46:35) tremendous just because there's confounding variables involved doesn't mean you can't control for these
(1:46:41) variables and if you have a significant enough data pool you can make uh
(1:46:47) statistically significant and meaningful correlations uh doesn't mean it's not
(1:46:52) like I don't know what he means by hard science but it doesn't mean it's it's not a valid or useful science so science
(1:47:00) in my opinion is only as useful as the controls which are put in place which is how you know something is
(1:47:05) methodologically correct um I've used it my my entire career applied science anyway even without
(1:47:12) knowing really that this was the scientific method but it's it's always based on controls the reason it's a soft
(1:47:19) science sociology and the reason uh that medicine is a soft science is specifically because there is such a
(1:47:26) higher rate of variables that you can't control for the data you get is mostly incorrect which is why when we look and
(1:47:33) we can look at this at the replication crisis the two fields which are the most affected are the medical field and
(1:47:40) sociology and it's because it has to do with these human variables that you can't control for which is why most data
(1:47:46) that people think is true when it comes to human behavior is absolutely false
(1:47:58) cool freaky D 99 9.99 999
(1:48:05) this is for vegan vegan gains I presume just wanted to send some love your way bro I disagree with your worldview but
(1:48:11) at the end of the day what matters is the state of the Soul keep seeking truth and truth may know you did one of my
(1:48:17) fans sent that in that is an enlightened Centrist super chat if I've ever seen one nice
(1:48:23) job Frankie vegan do you have anything to say uh no just thanks
(1:48:29) Dylan thank you for the support of PF young International media appreciate Dylan
(1:48:34) your investment will pay off Andrew's assertion that men show quote benevolence by not enslaving women is
(1:48:41) laughable shots fired as is his claim that men could simply take women's rights away
(1:48:48) guns the simple fact of 150 million jobs lost oh no I never thought about that
(1:48:55) wait women can there's a potentiality that women could use guns I never thought about the fact that well it
(1:49:02) takes attrition to win any sort of conflict admit or better equipped to deal with the elements we can carry far
(1:49:08) more weight we can use far better guns not to mention the fact that we're in control of the entirety of the infrastructure let's not even add on to
(1:49:15) that the fact that we're the only ones equipped to use modern military technology but on top of that just being
(1:49:22) maximum charitable to you if they took to the street with guns tomorrow right
(1:49:27) hand to hand is the basis of all combat right what was the old metal gear saying
(1:49:33) only a fool trust his life to a weapon they say uh but but the most the most
(1:49:38) important it's a joke I'm obviously trying to like okay I'm trying to like joke around right but what I'm saying is
(1:49:44) that we have complete control of everything and you have to have machines to build guns and I got to tell you the
(1:49:50) amount of gun makers who are female who are on this planet is almost zero it literally almost zero the amount of
(1:49:57) women who can create these types of weapons to even if you were to have like sides it's not even close it's absurd to
(1:50:04) say that women could just grab guns and take their rights tomorrow it's never been done anywhere however it's been
(1:50:10) done by men successfully Time and Time and Time and Time Again
(1:50:16) so I think it's ridiculous I'd like to say like so I'd like to add that I think it's ridiculous to think
(1:50:23) that men would I don't know just one day decide to take away all women's rights
(1:50:28) enslave them like men can't reproduce so like we need to rely on women
(1:50:34) we can reproduce time with enslaved women what do you mean I suppose but
(1:50:40) like the idea that you're gonna have all men on the planet have an interest in enslaving women graping them just so
(1:50:48) that you can make just to reproduce so you can have Society still exist and
(1:50:53) have enough men that have an interest in murdering like so many women I also
(1:51:00) don't think that's uh responsibility they just carry them off as uh as prices of battle like they've always done
(1:51:08) uh well try doing that if a woman has an AR-15 I mean well how would a woman oppose
(1:51:15) that if you have 50 men who have m60s and can actually use them you know what
(1:51:20) I mean you're not going to subdue somebody with an M60 you're going to kill them well I mean I think that they're far
(1:51:26) more likely to surrender if they're surrounded by men with m60s that's what I'm saying it's like you can you can
(1:51:32) still always the the pool on violence is going to be disproportionately on the
(1:51:37) male end to the point of absurdity like it's never going to be close you can't really it can't really believe it any
(1:51:45) other way if we're going to make these hypotheticals well men could do this well yeah sure I mean hypothetically women could just refuse to surrender no
(1:51:52) I mean men do do this and women don't do that women don't
(1:51:58) fight back women don't take their rights women look at the mass Mutiny is in Russia so
(1:52:04) mass mutinies by women well by men that's right
(1:52:10) yeah so that's right mass mutinies by men giving themselves rights because they don't like whatever the the pool
(1:52:16) was that they were granted they decided to change their rights and they did women don't do this
(1:52:22) they can't do this right so wouldn't that give them more motivation to like fight to the death
(1:52:28) well not historically historically they were just carried off like luggage okay well this is also before AR-15 no
(1:52:36) it wasn't before AR-15s or carried off like luggage right now when you have warring countries inside the Middle East
(1:52:42) still happens um I have a question for Andrew I don't know if he's heard this I have heard I
(1:52:49) don't know if it's true that women are actually better at men are obviously better at virtually
(1:52:55) every sport but women are better apparently at like Ultra long distance and then also shooting I've heard is
(1:53:01) that true they can't they can be uh it has been noted in the shooting sports that from the prone position uh that
(1:53:09) women tend to do better staying still for longer periods of time so I don't
(1:53:14) know this has been equated to internal monologue that women can stay still for a longer period of time I don't know if
(1:53:21) that's true or not but there has been some demonstration that women can be excellent Sharpshooters when trained I
(1:53:26) don't dispute that I don't dispute there's exceptional women I don't dispute that one day we'll have our first woman Navy SEAL I don't dispute
(1:53:33) any of that I just think it's totally irrelevant yeah I think um all the world record
(1:53:39) holders for like ultra distance swimming um are women so
(1:53:45) I I don't know why that would be but uh
(1:53:52) the unconventional man twenty dollars another large contribution support for The
(1:53:57) Crucible which we appreciate yes I would say thank you but Andrew does not pay me
(1:54:03) ping games you're vegan gains your respond your response to mothers abusing
(1:54:10) their children because they spend more time with their kids your response to mothers abusing their
(1:54:16) children is because they spend more time with their kids let's say if a man says well do you know how much time I spend
(1:54:21) with my wife how would you expect me not to abuse her LOL that is
(1:54:28) actually the case uh when you see well because of the pandemic you've seen
(1:54:34) an increase in couples spending more time together and uh you have seen much higher rates of abuse and uh police
(1:54:42) calls to deal with domestic abuse so like that is like like I mean it just makes sense
(1:54:47) if you're in an abusive relationship and you don't get along very well and then you're forced to cohabitate more uh you
(1:54:54) are you are going to see abuse go up so yeah
(1:55:00) lastly small fry also another contribution to PF young International with this amount of capital seating we
(1:55:08) will be Global soon enough thank you small fry Andrew as you know some patriarchal
(1:55:14) societies today make it difficult for women to vote Afghanistan do you think women are better or worse
(1:55:21) off in those societies I don't think it's their ability to vote that makes them more worse off I think that it's
(1:55:27) the ethical system of the religious foundations of fundamentalist Islam that
(1:55:32) makes them worse off not the vote I don't think the vote has anything to do with it that if you're in a society
(1:55:37) literally filled to the brim with people who are you know in in many cases two to
(1:55:43) three times your strength and could easily do horrible things to you but don't regardless of if you have laws
(1:55:49) protecting you or not shows that it's an ethical benevolence of men there are
(1:55:55) some systems which men adhere to which are not ethical and we fight over these systems constantly we go to war with
(1:56:00) each other we try to stop each other all of this type of thing but I don't think that it's the vote specifically that
(1:56:06) causes this rather the religious fundamentalism of Muslims themselves
(1:56:11) that causes yeah so there are Muslim majority of societies where women do have at least
(1:56:20) relatively equal rights to men like uh Turkey [Music] um
(1:56:26) it's uh I think I think it's like the fact that these societies like
(1:56:32) Afghanistan they're not just patriarchal they're not just
(1:56:37) um like Muslim radicals they just don't have the Democratic principles that we do
(1:56:43) where they adhere to that sort of democratic structure where even if they
(1:56:49) disagree with something um they will abide by the laws and
(1:56:54) regulations of the land but instead they just dogmatically follow Islam and
(1:56:59) they're willing to uh just kill people who disagree with
(1:57:05) them uh it's not just that you know they believe in Islamic principles
(1:57:11) yeah well I think it is because secular societies also kill people who disagree with them
(1:57:16) so I don't know how else it can be anything other than your moral Foundation secularism is not some moral
(1:57:22) Paradigm just because you say there's no religion involved well by secularism you mean just separation of church and state
(1:57:29) Yeah by secular government correct there's no I mean you you could say the CCP is secular but like in reality the
(1:57:39) like the government itself is essentially a religion so um I don't know you're kind of splitting
(1:57:45) hairs there I don't think I'm splitting hairs I think that secular societies which I think you would argue the United States is is supposed to be set up as a
(1:57:52) secular government that the United States kills people with wild abandon they don't give a [ __ ]
(1:57:58) you mean other countries yeah sure or well and its own citizens um I don't know about its own citizens
(1:58:05) really so you don't think that what happened with Floyd was a consequence of the patriarchal United States secular
(1:58:11) government no what do you think it was what do you think costs it well racism from the
(1:58:18) police involved so so secularism can't uh can't stop racism
(1:58:24) no neither can religion right so my point then is that secularism has no moral High Ground against religion and
(1:58:31) it's the ethical system and the ethical foundations which is what's causing the criminal the the crime in the way that
(1:58:36) men relate to women and the way men relate to each other well you can have ethical principles
(1:58:42) under a secular system maybe this is like a debate for another time though yeah I think that's you want to go down
(1:58:48) that road yeah I think that's fair hang on I'm switching over to the Dono chat side PF
(1:58:53) um by the way any everybody Dono chats available for anybody to use I built the
(1:58:58) entire payment processor for people so that they didn't have to feed on YouTube if they didn't want to
(1:59:05) anyway go ahead good YouTube sucks uh The Crucible so I guess Andrew sent
(1:59:11) himself a chat five dollars and a tenth of a penny our
(1:59:19) um one hour ago that's all oh yeah what am
(1:59:25) I gonna say in honor of this debate I told my woman to make me Hamburg our tartar to make me a hamburger
(1:59:33) I have no hamburger tartare it's far more sophisticated and I wouldn't mind um I wouldn't mind having
(1:59:39) you back for because I I've I I know that you do a lot of vegan debates and we haven't done one and I know that
(1:59:44) that's more your wheelhouse I wouldn't mind having you back for a vegan debate with me if you'd like to at some point people have been asking for uh round
(1:59:51) three with Zen Shapiro so we can do it we can do it I'm happy to get Zen
(1:59:56) Shapiro on here um I'm not allowed to moderate any debate that zenzi I'll moderate the
(2:00:02) [ __ ] debate I'm always Fair immediately go ahead man
(2:00:07) 51 minutes ago or five hours oh yes five dollars five
(2:00:12) dollars 51 minutes ago Orthodox Armenian no message entered uh user a man just
(2:00:19) showing just showing support for The Crucible because he's awesome appreciate that very much we know you callers have
(2:00:25) been waiting patiently we're gonna get through the super chats four dollars 45 minutes ago Circle G man
(2:00:32) VG is a mid tier female debater well somebody is confused about uh what
(2:00:40) a man and a woman is more than a few people are nowadays trust me yeah
(2:00:45) it's [ __ ] mosquitoes in here it's pissing me off oh those the genetically modified ones
(2:00:51) from Bill Gates dude I hate [ __ ] mosquitoes more than anything sorry anyway I don't know if I just broke to
(2:00:56) us there I think uh I get trouble for mentioning pointing that out Wilhelm bones for ten dollars did not
(2:01:04) say anything simply flexed support on this fun Saturday
(2:01:10) night long time supporter of The Crucible we appreciate it very much there was a couple other super chats
(2:01:15) that came in on the YouTube side just wanted to show show those real quick
(2:01:21) Paul Meyer great first name women can carry more body fat making
(2:01:26) them more buoyant while also providing more insulation conducive or Ultra long distance
(2:01:32) swimming I don't know if that's true if it is well I think he was saying because vegan gains had said that uh when most
(2:01:39) of the world records for uh long distance swimming are women which I had never heard that before but I think he's
(2:01:46) he's giving us the reason because VG said he didn't know the reason yeah yeah that that could be
(2:01:53) um yeah that sounds logical I trust anyone with the first name Paul
(2:01:59) made by Jim Bob 4.99 the original presuppositionalist Andrew
(2:02:04) if robots did all enforcement what would be the argument for male superiority
(2:02:12) what would it be insofar as rights slash law that we build them all that we build them all we program them all and we have
(2:02:19) complete and total control of all of the infrastructure which builds all of them
(2:02:26) so no matter which way you cut it men are always going to be the enforcers we're going to be the programmers of the
(2:02:32) robots we're going to be the Builders of the robots I work in robotics that's my field do you know how many robotics
(2:02:40) um Specialists that I've met robotics engineers or robotics Builders who are women there are some I'm not gonna lie
(2:02:46) there are but and some of them are actually quite good but there's not very many there's not very many and that
(2:02:53) field has been open for them for a long long time they're just not interested in it they're interested in other things
(2:03:00) that's just you know they're just interested in other things because it's a hard ass physically intensive job
(2:03:07) and they just don't like those jobs so I don't know if vegan did you want to
(2:03:12) say anything about that uh no I just think if there's going to
(2:03:18) be like uh Ai and automation kind of uh in charge of society I I think the
(2:03:25) argument that men should have more of a say um really
(2:03:31) it it really Falls flat in a situation like that
(2:03:37) sorry there was one more that came through another from the PF young media International Consortium thank you
(2:03:44) what do you think about Nassau wanting an all-woman team to go
(2:03:49) to Mars let's go with uh let's go with vegan gains first what do you think of I I
(2:03:57) don't know if they do um if they did let's assume that old school he's coming from my chat so you
(2:04:02) know he's a reliable source so assume that's true what do you think of that I think that whatever the mission
(2:04:08) that they're going to be on for whatever elongated state that they're going to be on it that men would be able to do that mission better
(2:04:14) all things equal that men would be able to accomplish this Mission better than the women would
(2:04:21) and I'll give you Survivor Island as my as my um my kind of like postulation
(2:04:27) here we saw what happened when we had Survival Island it's not that the women were dying though they were getting
(2:04:33) close to it it's just that the men men are [ __ ] engineered for this we're biologically engineered to do this [ __ ]
(2:04:39) just saying yeah so when you're talking about um astronauts I think women are
(2:04:46) completely competent to do a mission on their own um I don't see a why there'd be a
(2:04:52) massive difference in capability with space exploration between men and
(2:04:57) women and secondly if you're talking about surviving in space like I mean women are smaller so
(2:05:02) when you're in a cramped cabins in space I'd imagine women would be a bit more
(2:05:08) comfortable because there'd literally be more space for them to move around in uh metabolic requirements would also be
(2:05:15) lower because they're smaller so they wouldn't have to eat as more and um ensuring you know adequate nutrition
(2:05:22) would be a bit easier I think the only downside would be uh it's harder for them to pee in space
(2:05:28) well what about their menstrual cycle or the fact that they're weaker or the the
(2:05:34) fact that yeah you would probably require a great amount of strength on side in inside of some type of shuttle
(2:05:39) men can menstruate too Andrew I don't know if you've uh well you can you can just take a pill so that
(2:05:47) you don't menstruate um so that's kind of easy to deal with and
(2:05:53) um I I don't know what amount of strength you really need on a spaceship I wouldn't imagine it's much since you're
(2:05:59) weightless well that would be incorrect you would still need to have strength you still have you still have sockets and rivets and fasteners and all sorts
(2:06:06) of different things which go into the mechanics of the Machinery of whatever ship you're on which would require uh
(2:06:11) 24-hour maintenance so these things do require strength regardless of the gravitational pull inside of the
(2:06:18) spacecraft yeah but it's not to a degree where it's like you have to pull a 240 pound man out of a damaged tank sort of
(2:06:25) thing like in the military you ever had a stock fastener
(2:06:35) like dude there are female astronauts who've done space walks so I I don't see it being a big deal
(2:06:41) well whether they could accomplish it I'm not disputing that whether I'm
(2:06:47) disputing that I think that men all things equal would do it better that's
(2:06:52) my dispute do you disagree with that I think it would entirely come down to
(2:06:58) the individuals you choose not whether they're male or female yeah all things equal so all things equal except you
(2:07:05) know men have the male physiology so they're probably going to be stronger in this and that you know but all the other
(2:07:10) environmental factors are equal if supposedly um there was a big aspect of strength to
(2:07:18) be on a spaceship then I suppose men would be better but I don't think there's a big aspect of strength old
(2:07:24) school the gentleman who asked the question first off Fallout is an OG game so he had a great uh Avatar but he he
(2:07:32) said afterwards that the thinking is women use fewer resources so the capsule
(2:07:37) could be lighter I think vegan games pointed that out lower metabolic requirements so that could be a matter but it just doesn't
(2:07:44) matter you still are inside of an operating machine and that operating machine is going to have Fasteners and
(2:07:51) it's going to have problems going to have issues it's going to have all sorts of things that are required going to
(2:07:56) require something which is strength apt I just think it's absurd to think anything else you guys have worked on
(2:08:02) machines you know this like you I'm not I'm not speaking a different language to
(2:08:07) you am I you got to get a NASA engineer on here for this debate I would happily
(2:08:13) have I'd love to have a debate with a NASA engineer but anyway that's the end of the super chess PF do you want me to
(2:08:18) bring on callers um no we're going to wrap it up right now peace everyone
(2:08:24) hey just kidding ladies and gentlemen um the crucible's wife
(2:08:30) who I believe um our first interaction was her calling me [ __ ] from doing too many
(2:08:36) psychedelics to be honest
(2:08:41) I have some truth to that that's fair shoot your shoot your course for me
(2:08:47) okay well I missed the very opening arguments because as a slave of the
(2:08:54) patriarchy I was fetching Andrew his drinks and I missed uh vegan games opening but vegan games would you say
(2:09:01) your argument is based on you know for women voting is based on the idea that it's more democratic and provides more
(2:09:09) Liberty if we include women in voting yeah okay well based on that then I have a
(2:09:17) question I don't know if you're aware of this but uh anti-suffrage groups for
(2:09:22) about 40 years prior to the the 19th amendment being passed in the United States actually very ironically blocks
(2:09:30) women's referendums on voting so they did not want to let women vote on
(2:09:36) whether or not they wanted to vote and Elizabeth Katie Stanton and Susan B Anthony both said this was because if we
(2:09:43) left it up to women the women would not want the vote and the only few referendums we had showed that only
(2:09:50) about four percent of women at the time were interested at all in voting so uh is it Democratic to
(2:09:58) shove the 19th Amendment through when women are not the ones who wanted
(2:10:04) yes um look uh granting additional rights wait wait no you can't you can't mean
(2:10:11) that yeah so uh like look just because the majority of women say wouldn't want
(2:10:18) that right it doesn't mean it you're creating an expansion of Rights but
(2:10:24) how's that Democratic though the whole purpose of it is democratic that wouldn't be that would be the opposite
(2:10:30) of democratic you well that specific action
(2:10:35) um would I I guess in theory being non-democratic but it would be a greater
(2:10:41) expansion of democracy to allow that group to vote
(2:10:48) yeah I thought that might be your answer and then my next question my follow-up
(2:10:53) would be uh since we have given women the vote it's been just over a hundred
(2:10:58) years uh when women did start voting in larger numbers we see that they're one of the
(2:11:05) most uh closely studied demographics because now they actually make up the majority of voters since about the late
(2:11:10) 80s in the United States so every campaign on Earth has done tons and tons
(2:11:16) of studies on what women vote for why they vote for those things Etc and we
(2:11:22) see that women vote overwhelmingly in favor of more and more Draconian
(2:11:27) measures such as you know stricter and stricter gun control bigger and bigger welfare state Nanny State security state
(2:11:34) things like the Patriot Act they want they're generally more in favor of mandating any number of measures they
(2:11:42) want higher taxes Etc so we see that by giving women the vote you tend up you
(2:11:48) tend to end up with bigger and bigger government and less and less Liberty uh do you feel like it's ironic at all that
(2:11:54) by giving women the vote we end up with a less free Society
(2:11:59) I don't see that at all um when you mention things like taxes
(2:12:04) especially uh I mean you need taxes for wealth redistribution or else you're going to end up with a like a a huge
(2:12:12) oligarchy so I don't see that as being
(2:12:17) um like Draconian or big government if anything that controls
(2:12:22) um oligarchal Power more than yeah but it doesn't though because what about the take the Second Amendment which would be
(2:12:28) a Fail-Safe against Draconian power right if women are the ones who are voting against the Second Amendment and
(2:12:34) men are not doesn't that kind of make her case for her yeah so that is a problem and uh I am in favor of the
(2:12:41) Second Amendment um you are seeing an expansion of the
(2:12:47) second men a second amendment in general if anything though so I I know there is a big political push
(2:12:54) to ban guns uh in Canada there were sort of successful but
(2:12:59) uh Trudeau is a [ __ ] cuck by the way but um yes yeah we can agree on that yeah
(2:13:07) it's it's [ __ ] beyond belief but um like in the United States at least
(2:13:13) generally speaking you're seeing an expansion of firearms rights and you're seeing more women actually get
(2:13:19) interested in Firearms more women are owning guns than any other time period
(2:13:25) so I I don't I would actually I would love to debate you at some point if you were
(2:13:31) ever interested on whether or not women voting has led to a Freer more Democratic Society or not but at the
(2:13:37) risk of sounding misogynistic I will say I am also a Firearms instructor myself
(2:13:43) and I mainly teach women and most of them need several private lessons just to get over the loud banging noise yeah
(2:13:49) they uh have to use revolvers or um have their guns modify oh yeah they
(2:13:56) have to use revolvers yeah they don't have the hamstrings for to operate most semi-automatics they're
(2:14:03) shooting it in semi-auto any camera yes and they don't really feel they
(2:14:11) generally it is well it's just it's just hand strength like it is
(2:14:16) modern like they're only like four or five pounds of [ __ ] trigger pressure I know bro I know
(2:14:24) we know this we know this baffling at the beginning of every class I have
(2:14:30) to find out if the women can even operate the guns they have and the biggest problem that they have is
(2:14:35) actually just loading the magazines they can't even love the maggots
(2:14:41) especially in like you know like if 18 round Glock or something but that's
(2:14:47) where that's what but that's the point right it's like the strength differential alone I think that will say
(2:14:52) things like but women could have guns I'm like well that's not just a strength difference like these have to be women
(2:14:58) who have like either don't work or do desk jobs like they don't do any kind of
(2:15:03) work with their hands that's not just but that's almost every woman bro yeah that's
(2:15:11) everything they're in restaurants clerk work and they're in they're in everything except working with their hands you know what I will say this like
(2:15:18) I I used to do personal training a lot and not too long ago is also doing online coaching
(2:15:24) uh I don't think women have some of the strength issues they claim to have too
(2:15:30) because I like I've trained women in person where they're like this is way too heavy for me and if you just tell
(2:15:36) them you're gonna lift it just lift it they can lift it yeah or if you don't tell them how much it is yes it's the
(2:15:43) same thing yeah same thing with guns same thing so I don't know how much of that is them saying Oh I can't even pull
(2:15:48) the trigger or like they just won't like you know squeeze it hard enough I mean I
(2:15:53) guess that's kind of point because me being a woman and I've done strength Sports weightlifting powerlifting for 16
(2:16:00) years now and I and I shoot and my grip strength is actually 20 pounds stronger
(2:16:05) than the average man but the average woman's grip strength I want to say is something like 40 pounds per hand uh but
(2:16:13) yeah it's a lot of it is psychological and just getting them over the fear of everything and it's really tough to do
(2:16:19) so I just don't think it's likely that we're going to see women just picking up arms and overtaking the men because you
(2:16:25) have to remember like when you guys were talking about the military the women in the military can't beat the
(2:16:31) men in the military yeah yeah all right well that's all for me
(2:16:37) thank you Rachel thanks for coming on we'll see you next time
(2:16:43) um we have the improperly spelled Greek City um tonight quickly run something about
(2:16:50) the long distance swimming before I ask Andrew the question sure I'll allow it so no that's not the reason Ultra
(2:16:57) endurance athletes don't have a high enough body fat percentage for average weight for a body fat to matter
(2:17:04) um only one of the records or one of the major records is held by a woman most are in Hubble and one of the main reasons is just just not a fleshed out
(2:17:11) sport some of the records are still standing since 1937. it's not done
(2:17:16) enough where's the trans flag bro well uh it fell out apparently in the ultra
(2:17:22) long distance swimming in particular or are you just talking about like running I know there's Ultra long distance swimming in Ultra marathons as well have
(2:17:29) the same issue where you see like mostly efforts being held by people in their 30s and 40s while past life Peak I'd
(2:17:34) agree with the running for sure because no like there's some [ __ ] races that last for three days like they're [ __ ]
(2:17:40) stupid nobody's gonna do that um so I'd agree with that um the swimming I'm not so sure
(2:17:46) um six days too are you are you sure because I I know
(2:17:53) there's something well I I know there's some like you're talking about swimming
(2:17:58) like across a lake or something and having to rest like on one side or um or
(2:18:04) what um I know this six day record is some uh as far as I know is something around a
(2:18:09) little over a thousand kilometers from Men in 800 for women or might be thinking of endurance running yeah
(2:18:15) because you can't sleep in the water like you'll you'll die
(2:18:22) yeah I know some of those swimming records they they last for almost 24
(2:18:27) hours uh I think some of them might even be a little more we have to swim constantly for like literally a full day
(2:18:34) gentlemen I don't mean to cut in but yeah this is totally irrelevant and we have other callers going behind so the
(2:18:41) main question is gonna be towards danger then for um when we look at then if we just grant all the descriptive and we look at the
(2:18:47) prescriptive do you think that if we allow having them to vote we're going to more accurately be able to address women's issues than if they're not left
(2:18:55) you don't think having those groups be able to have political Powers going to more accurately help them address the
(2:19:00) issues that they feel I don't think so I think they because they're just still appealing them in no matter what it's
(2:19:05) always just an appeal to men to enforce whatever force is going to be but to be able to yeah yeah but they can bring the
(2:19:13) issues to the appeal whether they vote or not in fact I would I would argue the opposite I would say that men if men had
(2:19:19) the only right to vote that they would probably do a lot better for women's issues than women do
(2:19:26) I think that would just be inherently faulty you're gonna Well it can't it can't but it can't be Corinth because
(2:19:31) look at the courts the courts are the prime example uh right now you wouldn't argue that
(2:19:36) we're not in a patriarchal system and yet the courts are biased towards women even with male judges and with male
(2:19:43) juries and with males in general even the situation of the 16 or 15 year old
(2:19:48) girl with the the 20 year old male teacher and the 15 year old boy with a 20 year old male teacher you and I have
(2:19:54) discussed this we understand that there's like a difference there whether we can point it out maybe not it's not just but
(2:20:01) there's a difference it seems like men kind of go out of their way to be super benevolent towards women and even did uh
(2:20:08) before women have the right to vote we seem to cherish them love them care a whole lot about them we don't seem to
(2:20:13) just be martyrs who go through and just like you know pillage and rape and all this this that just seems absurd to me
(2:20:20) like by the way on the 15 year old 20 year old teacher thing like we may have that opinion because of our own biases
(2:20:27) like I don't know if women would think the same way yeah we generally overlay infantilized women that's why we seem to
(2:20:34) see these things so that's what I'm saying is like maybe we're actually better better at dealing with the with
(2:20:40) his issues even than they are we we've always seemed to be better we're going to be looking at the set of those issues
(2:20:46) so one of the things which ones the issues where we're going to say these people are going to be like less capable
(2:20:53) don't give me general questions you went for the courts that's gonna be assigned within fantalization that's going to
(2:20:59) show another thing that we're going to see Downstream that is we're going to then not allow women into certain fields that they would qualify so you want
(2:21:05) women to have the right to vote so they suffer more
(2:21:17) in charge of giving women far more benevolence and rights by the way it's
(2:21:24) not right I think you can agree that you can over coddle somebody like if you protect a child from everything and give
(2:21:31) them like as much love as possible they might grow up to be a weenie and might have like issues in the future I've seen
(2:21:36) that with women where they're like literally treated like children their entire lives and then they they just
(2:21:42) can't navigate the world like a functioning person so I don't see how gentlemen to infantilize uh women all
(2:21:48) the time if your argument is to say that you think women should have the right to vote so that we can hold those [ __ ]
(2:21:54) responsible then I'm a hundred percent let's go there we go there we go
(2:22:01) thanks for the colleague oh Corinth did you have anything you wanted to shout out before he went uh I want to see that vegan with Zen
(2:22:07) please okay well so we'll set it up I promise we'll set it up um vegan games welcome here whenever he
(2:22:13) wants um next caller Moby oh yeah I know your friend dick sorry
(2:22:19) I'm okay um I just wanted to say Vegan gains I thought you really brought it tonight you were very high energy you really
(2:22:25) brought the heat um you excited everyone in the crowd everyone was just on their feet cheering so I just want to thank you for that
(2:22:32) um and then I had one more question for you um where do rights come from
(2:22:38) where your rights come from uh they're granted by other individuals so rights are just a social construct
(2:22:45) yeah okay so we could just say you don't have rights and animals don't have rights and now we have no reason to be vegan
(2:22:53) well no it just means those rights wouldn't be granted it wouldn't mean we don't have a reason to what's the reason
(2:23:00) well they're like a reason could be if you value things like logical consistency if you're empathic
(2:23:08) um some some aspects of veganism can directly benefit you like elf
(2:23:13) so there's plenty of reasons it's just that if you for whatever reason decide not to Grant somebody rights then yeah
(2:23:20) they don't have rights but rights have to be granted by um by others like they're not like again
(2:23:27) if you're gonna say they're granted by God or something well okay has God ever protected any of your rights like if
(2:23:33) you're protesting and a cop decides to arrest you do you think God's gonna stop you like or help you like no so they
(2:23:40) have to be granted by other individuals that would include animal rights yeah that would increase animal rights come
(2:23:45) from Men uh and women because women also who get
(2:23:50) the rights from men violate huh they get their rights women well women also are
(2:23:56) involved in the system of you know like food and killing and eating men let them
(2:24:02) yeah that's what I'm saying is like so animal rights really come from men so
(2:24:08) yeah okay so if we Grant animal rights uh to animals which is one of your
(2:24:14) highest principles wouldn't you say men are pretty benevolent
(2:24:24) yeah if we did though if men said hey we're gonna we're gonna back off on this whole you know killing animals thing
(2:24:31) would that be good demonstration for you because I I I'm pretty confident now I haven't looked at the numbers you tell
(2:24:37) me because this is your domain would you say there's more men active in the vegan movement or women no uh I
(2:24:44) think still to this day it's about um I think either eight to one or ten to one uh male female to male so for every
(2:24:52) one male there's about eight to ten women really yeah if you go to a great way to
(2:24:58) not to get not take away their [ __ ] vote but they're a great reason [Laughter]
(2:25:04) I follow up my follow-up question I appreciate the answer again you really brought the energy tonight
(2:25:10) um so thank you for that my follow-up question is since uh rights are just a social construct how can you go and
(2:25:17) appeal as if animals already have rights if it's just something granted
(2:25:22) I'm not saying they already have right well they technically do already have
(2:25:27) rights like you can like you can't just like murder your dog why not some of them
(2:25:34) there are right so well yeah you could but you'd be violating the rights and if
(2:25:39) somebody found out you'd be wrong but who says who they have rights people do but I'm a person and I'm
(2:25:46) saying they don't have rights right but Society at large has said they
(2:25:51) do have rights um large has said that eating meat is okay so now eating meat is okay
(2:25:57) that's not what I'm saying I'm not making a normative statement on whether something is right or wrong based on
(2:26:04) whether or not something has a right right now I'm just saying animals should have a rights be should have rights
(2:26:14) well for a variety of reasons uh the name the main reason is I believe sentient beings
(2:26:21) um should have moral consideration why well that's just my own personal
(2:26:27) preference that's a great argument I appreciate it okay well wait you know what no no well since you're such a
(2:26:33) genius oh it's because God said so that's a very very good argument all right all right enough enough idiot
(2:26:41) thanks for the call in I appreciate it uh Eric uh you're live thank you so much
(2:26:48) for the calling go ahead with your question uh yeah so I have a question for you
(2:26:53) um what are your thoughts of women being in office
(2:26:58) uh being you mean in in government positions yes yeah I think it'd be preferable to
(2:27:05) have men in all government positions okay uh do you think it could be edifying for
(2:27:12) a woman to be in a uh government I'm sorry I'm sorry I don't I don't I really
(2:27:18) don't mean to cut in I want to hear your question respond to it but your audio is extremely low
(2:27:23) well it's muffled it sounds like you're talking yeah sock or something yeah it's really bad and I'm actually Bluetooth
(2:27:29) yeah I'm actually having uh trouble hearing you so
(2:27:34) is this better yeah that's way better
(2:27:40) okay so I was asking do you believe it can be edifying for a woman to be in
(2:27:46) office sure you mean to to the woman yes
(2:27:51) sure okay uh well that was just my question
(2:27:56) because I was curious because um Saint Theodora was actually an emperor so I
(2:28:02) was just curious because if you said no I was going to wonder how to reconcile those things because I've
(2:28:08) had this discussion with um people who would disagree with that well I understand I'm just not one of
(2:28:15) them was there anything else that you had sir oh yeah this is um off topic but um will
(2:28:22) Pedro be back on The Crucible I I don't I don't know if that'll ever happen
(2:28:29) um there was never any Fallout between me and Pedro uh nothing like that he had
(2:28:34) some other issues going on in life and called me and said that he needed to deal with those and not The Crucible so
(2:28:41) um he's still one of my closest friends and I wish him the best of luck glad to hear you have a good rest of
(2:28:48) your night you too man take care neuro Jack you've been waiting patiently go ahead question
(2:28:55) You Know Jack is an absolute King thank you sir thank you guys for having me on
(2:29:00) um I want to ask both of you guys a question but I want to start with vegan gains just a conversational quick couple
(2:29:07) questions uh I'm not I am trying to catch you in a trap so I'll just be off front but it's not I I I I kind of
(2:29:15) understand where you're coming from so I think I see where you're kind of going wrong and I want to point that out and
(2:29:20) maybe maybe you'll prove me wrong my first question is do you how do you feel about immigration into let's say Canada
(2:29:28) and the United States as an example what I feel about immigration
(2:29:34) um I think it's necessary for uh economic reasons especially when you talk about not just replacing certain
(2:29:41) jobs but uh keeping certain jobs uh it's pretty clear that when countries have
(2:29:49) um at least reasonable levels of immigration you end up having a greater
(2:29:54) retention of well-paying but not particularly High skilled jobs so
(2:30:00) usually like Factory uh Factory labor so like GM was the biggest employer in the
(2:30:06) United States not too long ago a few decades ago most of those jobs are gone now and they've moved overseas you could
(2:30:13) actually prevent some of those jobs from leaving if you allow for immigration the UK has had a similar problem where they
(2:30:20) didn't allow for enough immigration and you saw a complete like all of those
(2:30:25) jobs the well-paying manufacturing jobs are gone and the biggest employers are like shitty companies like Walmart okay
(2:30:32) look let me I'm going to Veer off what I wanted to do initially I'll come back to that okay so my second
(2:30:40) question would be if you compare generally the West as far
(2:30:45) as feminist ideals could to somewhere like let's say India or some other place
(2:30:50) where women have significantly less supposed rights uh
(2:30:58) do you see some conflict of interest by importing people into a system in which you're trying to
(2:31:04) live up to feminist standards yet the people incoming maybe don't really have those values
(2:31:10) no um you could have you could certainly have issues with um like like a lot of
(2:31:17) right Wingers extremists from coming into the country that's why you do have you do vet immigrants like I don't want
(2:31:24) somebody who's like supportive of the Taliban from coming into the country and
(2:31:29) what I do think specifically about feminine you know feminist ideas I mean the average yeah
(2:31:35) India doesn't I mean it's changing granted but what I'm saying is in general people from India say don't
(2:31:42) really have the same values of feminism as we in the west do right yeah yeah
(2:31:48) sure so um I do think you see a big disconnect between
(2:31:54) um government and the actual people who live there uh that is the case in India that's especially the case in places
(2:31:59) like Iran um I have not met a single person uh
(2:32:05) who's come from Iran who is like very right-wing who thinks
(2:32:10) women shouldn't have rights uh there should be like an Islamic State they're actually pretty Progressive
(2:32:17) um whereas the actual government institution is very right-wing um I think the same thing is largely true of
(2:32:23) India where the people there are a lot more Progressive than their actual Institution
(2:32:29) so that has to be taken into account but like I I just haven't seen a big
(2:32:34) um demographic like voting change from because there's so many like Indian
(2:32:39) immigrants and [ __ ] you're seeing much more uh right-wing voting well no hang on guys guys listen I'm sorry to cut in
(2:32:46) neuro Jack I gotta have you have your question over to me and then I gotta have you go Jeff young only has a
(2:32:52) limited amount of time we want to make sure that we wrap this show up on time to get him on his way since he so graciously came in and of course I'm
(2:32:58) gonna tip him yes I'm gonna tip him you [ __ ] of course but anyway go ahead
(2:33:04) uh not into one simple statement and then I'll ask the question of uh both you
(2:33:11) guys basically but uh so my my statement would be essentially
(2:33:16) some of the problems that you allude to vegan games about let's say demographic decline within the country could be
(2:33:23) attributive attributable to feminism basically meaning the
(2:33:28) destruction of the family unit is kind of what I'm trying to argue about right and so
(2:33:34) that perceives the problem of uh Democratic decline then you import to
(2:33:40) solve the problem that was caused by you know the idea of feminism and so my question to
(2:33:46) basically to Andrew would be do you see any value in the ideals of feminism that
(2:33:52) are salvageable and to vegan gains I would say are there any things about feminism that you think are
(2:33:58) a problem and that aren't being addressed yes no sorry if you want to go first
(2:34:05) from my perspective there's not a single redeeming quality about feminism it was
(2:34:12) always a bad idea and it was manufactured by a bunch of occultist lunatics who don't know what the [ __ ]
(2:34:18) they're talking about and if you read their writings and you can find this great book called a cult feminism which
(2:34:24) was written by my wife Rachel Wilson which goes through them extensively uh this was manufactured by lunatics and it
(2:34:31) doesn't map on very well which is why you see me and vegan gains were on totally opposite sides of the political
(2:34:37) Spectrum kind of ending up having to agree on descriptors over and over and over again people are trying to
(2:34:43) literally mug your mind of what reality is it's [ __ ] insane so no there's
(2:34:49) nothing redeeming about it it's [ __ ] and it should be done away with completely
(2:34:55) yeah so if you're talking about demographic decline like people having less children
(2:35:01) um the main reason for that is just economics it's becoming so expensive to live and there's so few Social Services
(2:35:09) to support young families that young people are just deciding not to have children and you're seeing changes in
(2:35:14) relationship Dynamics as a result of that as well I just want to get one final
(2:35:20) make it fast man I promise uh so that don't you think that it's possible that
(2:35:26) that's a result of feminist ideology and don't you think it's possible that that
(2:35:31) is done by on purpose by uh the oligarchy that you think doesn't exactly exist and then okay my final point I'll
(2:35:40) say is uh don't forget that was your final Point bro we have to we have to end it in the past I'm just gonna play
(2:35:46) uh I was just gonna quote Mao Zedong political power grows out of the barrel of a gun and that's it bye yeah but we
(2:35:52) both agreed that might makes but that doesn't mean it makes right I'm just saying but anyway go ahead vegan
(2:35:59) yeah like um the the reason why uh costs are going
(2:36:04) up so high it's entirely due to just corporate greed
(2:36:10) um if anything feminist principles like you know left-wing ideals would probably
(2:36:15) actually uh raise the rate at which people have children because it would make it just cheaper to live except that
(2:36:22) secularism seems to be the the kind of necessary worldview which is entailed
(2:36:28) with leftism and it seems that secular people don't breed at least not nearly
(2:36:33) at the rates that religious people do it's not even close well you could argue that's not because
(2:36:40) of secular beliefs but because people who have secular beliefs are also
(2:36:46) smarter and are better at Family Planning that's true you could argue that but if we look at empirics we do
(2:36:52) see that a lot of times the people who are the most religious are breeding because they believe it's a commandment
(2:36:57) from God to do so secularists don't believe that so it kind of logically follows that if they don't of course
(2:37:04) they're going to have less children well that's not uh that's not necessarily out
(2:37:09) of the line with my with my explanation because a smarter person is going to be
(2:37:15) able to think for themselves whereas a less intelligent person is just going to accept things at face value and
(2:37:21) regardless of the consequences they'll just do it anyway well I mean I don't know that seems like you're kind of saying that you think Christians are
(2:37:27) stupid yeah but on average Christians I'd say
(2:37:32) are dumber than atheists you think so yeah based on what
(2:37:38) um I I think there's actually some statistics showing that uh the degree to which somebody is religious uh the
(2:37:45) greater likelihood they have a lower IQ well that's true but you would have to uh factor in other things for IQ right
(2:37:53) otherwise you would yeah right you'd be you don't you don't want to be a race for your list right well
(2:37:59) they're well there isn't really any great research uh relating race to IQ
(2:38:05) um in fact if anything um the best data indicates that black people are genetically more prone to
(2:38:12) higher intelligence than white people um that could be a debate for another day perhaps but
(2:38:19) yeah yeah I don't know they from from me from a Christian ethic um race has
(2:38:24) always been irrelevant to any type of policy prescription it's just the same always has but it's necessary for me to
(2:38:32) kind of state that like look clearly Christians aren't [ __ ] stupid I mean they founded the nation there's no doubt
(2:38:39) that they did most of them were not deist they were Christians yeah I know that the deist argument is there but
(2:38:45) most of them were Christians there was thousands of contributors who were Christians yeah so yeah so I'm not
(2:38:51) saying being Christian makes you stupid um I'm saying that uh you're probably going to see a higher degree of
(2:38:57) intelligence among people that are non-religious versus religious yeah I don't I don't know I think that
(2:39:04) uh I I think I think that is a good debate that we could have but I appreciate your time very much vegan
(2:39:10) gains and Paul PF who took the time this evening were out of callers appreciate
