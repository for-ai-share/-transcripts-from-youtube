(0:00) are you remotely apprehensive about unleashing Mrs wilson on the world like
(0:05) this no um but she is the only Wilson on the panel that I claim i'm just just pointing it out is there anything you do
(0:11) i mean do you you put the bins out do you you know the trash out i mean what what do you do you do anything i don't
(0:16) do the piece of that you're married to yeah he clearly doesn't respect you jokes about how he married you he
(0:24) doesn't piece of because that's why he married Clementine do all lives matter you do you know what all lives do
(0:30) matter and thank you thank you and what's all but the one terrible thing
(0:35) you found I've ever said you completely agree with clementine do do you hate men
(0:41) no of course I don't hate men why in 2020 did you tweet the Corona virus isn't killing men fast enough i tweeted
(0:47) that in 2020 as a misguided tweet apologize to men again do it again this
(0:53) is honestly the one of the most absurd conversations I've ever had in my life
(0:59) white House press secretary Caroline Levit is rarely out of the spotlight that's her job after all and for what
(1:04) it's worth she seems to be very good at it but a behind-the-scenes photograph posted by a colleague for Mother's Day
(1:09) in the in America has divided opinion even among a generally appreciative MAGA
(1:15) base 16 million people saw this candid snap of leather in the White House seemingly holding a baby son in one arm
(1:21) while quote owning the libs close with the other a lot of those people applauded her as a super mom many others
(1:28) criticized her for aping conservative family values while actually promoting a feminist myth about women who could have
(1:34) it all that might seem a bit harsh but the MAGA movement she's part of has made big inroads in popular culture by
(1:40) promoting the return of traditional gender roles here she is talking about masculinity back in 2023
(1:48) a man is someone who stands up for his family provides for those that he loves and contributes to his community a great
(1:55) example helping an elderly woman with her groceries helping a neighbor or a friend putting others before yourself
(2:00) that's the definition of a man i'm proud to have so many strong men in my life two older brothers a great father we
(2:07) love men we need men and as women Jen we should not be afraid to say that well there's undeniably been a huge
(2:13) backlash to the whole era of demoralizing all men as miniature Harvey Weinstein with ambitions that are
(2:20) wickedly patriarchal coincidentally you can read about how that's going on in my upcoming new book Woke is Dead has there
(2:27) ever been a better time for a book called Woke Is Dead but where does the renaissance of masculine men leave the
(2:32) women who thought it was a very good idea andrew Wilson was extolling the virtues of a more limited female role in
(2:38) a previous debate on Uncensored when a shocked Emily Austin said this are you
(2:44) married married how do you make a married with many children you married with children oh she's she's ecstatic
(2:51) you know I'm 23 boss lady girl which seems to be driving you crazy working
(2:57) making for the right guy to the only thing you have you have no arguments you just try to assault me personally well
(3:04) Andrew Wilson's apparently ecstatic wife Rachel got in touch on X and told me she'd like to participate in our next
(3:10) debate and so she will she'll be joining us alongside an all new panel of boss
(3:15) lady girls well joining me now is the host of Crucible Andrew Wilson Andrew's wife and
(3:22) author of Occult Feminism the secret history of women's liberation Rachel Wilson Emily Wilson no relation from
(3:29) Emily Saves America and the feminist writer and author of I Don't the Case against Marriage Clementine Ford so
(3:36) welcome to all of you um Andrew great to have you back on Uncensored are are you
() 
(3:41) remotely apprehensive about unleashing Mrs wilson on the world like this no um
(3:49) but she is the only Wilson on the panel that I claim i'm just just pointing it out
(3:54) everyone seems to be either called Wilson or Emily in this debate um in this two-header Rachel welcome to
(4:00) Uncensored you reached out to me on X and and very boldly said "If you want to
(4:05) debate this properly get me on you're here how are you feeling about this?"
(4:11) Well thank you for having me Piers and thank you Andrew for unchaining me from the stove just long enough to appear
(4:17) today i got a day pass from the patriarchy patriarchy is benevolent
(4:22) so true yeah so I'm very happy to be here uh people love to attack my husband
(4:27) via me i'm I'm like the favorite way to do that so I thought why not come on and and talk to people myself so look Rachel
(4:35) let's let's cut to the quick a lot of Andrew's critics not me a lot of his critics say that he's an obvious blatant
(4:42) misogynist he thinks all women should be you know kept at home working away on the stove the housework whatever it may
(4:49) be uh and know their place in life you are actually married to him you've been
(4:55) subject to mockery inadvertently through the last debate we had about this for having you to endure being his wife what
(5:02) is it like being married to Andrew Wilson well it's pretty awesome i mean he's
(5:08) hilarious he's really smart guy he's very charming and most of all he's a great dad and a great husband and I
(5:15) share his worldview so I I would agree in fact I would say I would probably be the more bitter misogynist out of the
(5:22) two of us if you really had to like pick one it would probably be me so really why do you say that i just think that
(5:29) feminism has absolutely destroyed so much of what I hold dear in life and it's held me back more than it's helped
(5:36) me it's one of the reasons I started looking into the history and investigating it for myself and I think
(5:42) it's just created a a a world where we now have a two-income economy and for
(5:47) women like me who do want to prioritize motherhood it makes it extremely hard it just makes it financially difficult i
(5:54) faced tons of social pressure had my first daughter at 20 wanted to stay home
(5:59) everyone around me even the so-called Christian conservative women told me it was a terrible idea you can't do that
(6:06) you have to bring the baby to daycare you're going to put yourself at risk you know the your husband's going to hurt
(6:11) you you're going to be abused if you don't have your own money and your own career and I think it's backwards i
(6:16) think it's the most inefficient stupid thing we've ever come up with and that in the future people will look back at
(6:22) the feminist experiment as a goofy time in history where we tried this wild
(6:27) experiment that failed miserably and thank God it's over wow okay well Clementine Ford I'm sure that you agree
(6:34) with every word of that don't you um firstly I'm very glad that you're
(6:39) happily married it's great you know a lot of women are not happily married and they find it very difficult to leave
(6:45) marriages particularly because of the financial strain so good for you um I do
(6:50) think that your historical understanding of feminism is extremely skewed the idea
(6:56) that somehow we've only created a two-income household because feminism has tried to destroy the world is
(7:01) historically inaccurate um in large part well firstly you're also talking about feminism from your very and when I say
(7:09) limited I'm not trying to insult you but the limited perspective of feminism in America and the understanding of the
(7:15) economy in America it's not taking into account the global reality of the fact that women have always worked women
(7:22) still continue to work women for the most part produce the majority of the world's underpaid if you know
(7:29) drastically underpaid labor um when you talk about a twoinome household being
(7:34) somehow instituted by feminism you're failing to take into account that even in America you know the the kind of the
(7:42) glamorization of this golden age of marriage in the 1950s to the early 1960s which the marriage historian Stephanie
(7:48) Coots calls the long decade this coincided with an increase in women in
(7:53) the workplace so it's not it's not as if there was this golden age where women weren't ma weren't where married women
(8:00) sorry weren't working for a lot of that actually the
(8:05) labor that is required to support the middle class is uh has always been
(8:11) relied on for poor and disenfranchised women largely in America black women
(8:17) start let me just let me just finish let me just finish we have to speed things up a little bit and the the economy the
(8:23) downturn in the economy the the boom that happened after the Second World War was unsustainable it was a wonderful
(8:29) time between around 1940 to 1970 for white working-class men in particular
(8:34) and then it began to But I have a question for you one of the reasons why women had to go into the workforce was
(8:41) because they had to help women okay i have a question for you Clementine it's a very simple question but I think it'll
(8:46) be an interesting question to ask you what is a woman yes i'm not going down the path of
(8:53) debating trans women with you trans women trans women i asked you what a woman is okay I'll tell you but I know
(8:59) that because this is your tactic this is what you do what is a woman i'll tell you it shouldn't be controversial i'll
(9:05) tell you i'll tell you i'll tell you what a woman is a woman is someone who has at least at one point in her life
(9:12) felt scared of a man sorry so so but you guys never want to
(9:17) talk about Wait hang on hang on you guys never heard so men any man who's ever felt afraid of another man as a woman no
() 
(9:24) no talking about what I'm saying you know this is exactly why you're wearing that shirt that says repeal you should
(9:30) put the 19th under it it's this unbelievable what are you talking about a woman any anybody who has ever at one
(9:38) point been afraid of it's the stupidest thing I've ever heard do you have an actual argument here would you let me
(9:43) finish speaking or Yeah how long is it going to take for you to finish how long is it going to take for you to finish
(9:49) yes do you really just invite people on your show to be interrupted like this well Clemson look all due respect we did do a bit of research into what you said
(9:55) about me in the past so I think I'm entitled to give you No you already know what I think about that question because
(10:01) I've written about you asking that question yes you have in fact you said like all of the Why would you ask it
(10:06) again when you know what my I'm just to enlighten the audience who have no idea what you're talking about or me like all
(10:11) of the bigots that's me apparently currently jumping on the trans phobic shuttle to Ding-Dong Station morgan
(10:18) wants you to believe this is about fairness and equality specifically fairness and equality in women's sports
(10:23) that was exactly what it was about and the problem is Clementine with all due respect to you uh the reality is I I
(10:30) doubt it i doubt it's going with due respect treat you with perfect respect but your inability to just simply state
(10:36) what a woman actually is particularly given two weeks ago in the UK the Supreme Court made it very clear that a
(10:44) woman is a biological female that's it it's a scientific fact the fact that you
(10:49) can't answer that is part of the problem i'd like to No the thing is that I would like to know why you in particular are
(10:57) so obsessed with this definition of what a woman is firstly how does it impact
(11:02) you in any way secondly I have a 13-year-old daughter i have a 13-year-old daughter and if my
(11:08) 13-year-old daughter decides she wants to ask me a question you ask me a question I'm going to answer it well if
(11:14) you don't want an answer don't ask me a question here's my answer to your question i have a 13-year-old me you
(11:20) won't I have a 13-year-old daughter i have seven nieces right and some of them
(11:25) are very expert if I may answer your question some of them are very good at sport right the idea that they would one
(11:33) day have their dream of potentially an Olympic place or a team GB place whatever it may be a world championship
(11:40) base taken from them by a biological male I think is completely outrageous
(11:46) and by the way so does most of the world now which is why there's been a reversing screeching U-turn on this
(11:52) particular subject but I come back to my question to you your inability to say what a woman is and yet here you are
(11:58) lecturing women on how they should behave as women is completely perverse
(12:06) i think that reducing women specifically to your biological dec
(12:14) it's called science it's their chromosome you have different chromosomes to me it's not me saying
(12:21) that i'm not writing the first writing the science i'm sure I'm not the first person i'm sure I'm not the first person
(12:27) to tell you about interex people so how do you interex people no no no this is
(12:33) all wrong anyway the interex is not a third sex it's not a third sex that's ridiculous there is no third sex there's
(12:40) two sexes male female categorized scientifically interex is not a third sex anybody can look that up in 5
(12:47) seconds total lie how did you not know that by the way how did you not know interex is not a third sex i didn't say
(12:54) that interex with a with a sex you did but interact what the implication was and interex people have interex people
(13:03) can have a mixture of chromosomes so if you if you are you saying they're a third sex or aren't you if you present
(13:09) to the world as if they're not a third sex then there's you have no argument
(13:14) here do you understand that if he's what he's saying is this is what is objective with trans women so obsessed with why
(13:22) are you so obsessed with answer the question for a start no everyone has
(13:28) interrupted me let me speak for you just asked a question keep asking questions Clementine and then refusing to allow
(13:35) people to answer if you don't want to answer don't ask a question the truth about the truth about the abs the
(13:41) problem is the problem is feminists in particular I've noticed feminists have latched on over the last few years to
(13:48) this idea that If anybody raised any concerns about the way the trans lobby
(13:53) was trying to make things unequal unfair and unsafe for actual women then they
(13:59) were immediately transphobic i kept saying "I want trans people to have the exact same rights to fairness equality
(14:06) and safety as me or you." However what was happening was women's rights were
(14:11) being eroded so that things were not fair they weren't equal and they weren't safe and we saw absolute parodies of
(14:18) this in the Olympics in the boxing ring where people who have been banned from
(14:23) the World Championships because they apparently reported positive for male chromosomes were getting in the ring and
(14:29) beating women up in the ring and so a woman's going to die if this was allowed to carry on so now people have stopped
(14:35) it now sporting bodies around the world have stopped it but you Clementine I say this respectfully are still flying the
(14:42) flag for this and you can't even say what a woman is and I just find the fact that you want to lecture women
(14:48) like Rachel on how they should be as a woman is completely perverse given you
(14:53) don't even know or don't want to say what an actual woman is anything to Rachel i haven't said anything to Rachel
(15:00) i've never met Rachel before in my life until today well you responded to what she you responded to what she said about
(15:06) the the role of a woman lecturing her i wasn't lecturing her it sounded like you lecturing to me let me bring in Emily let me bring in Emily is actually
(15:12) telling Let me bring in Emily waiting pat historical reality of economics in the US let me bring in Emily who you
(15:18) wanted to divert it to talk about trans women because that's clearly No you banged on about trans women i just said
(15:23) to you if you don't know what a woman is we've got a problem that by the way no I I just she's wrong about the the
(15:30) economic history she's the one looking at it through an economic prism that's extremely narrow she's using feminist
(15:36) standpoint theory to try to tell us what the history of economics is she can't explain to us why through all of human
(15:43) history and all let her finish let her finish lady you talked plenty lady you
(15:48) talked plenty through all of Western history we were able to raise a family like a janitor could raise a family with
(15:54) four children on his income up until 1970 and what happened in 1970 we pushed
(16:00) women into the workforce in huge numbers and we practically doubled the workforce
(16:05) overnight by pushing mothers and women into the workforce uh this happened right alongside the creation of gender
(16:11) studies as an academic discipline and now we are in a situation where we don't have a family economy we have an
(16:17) individual income economy which means most people can't raise a family without both parents working okay let me bring
(16:23) in Emily's been waiting very patiently uh Emily uh good to see you again now you started a kind of MAGA civil war
() 
(16:31) when you railed against women who want to be a trad wife uh you posted a Tik Tok video which caused a lot of mayhem
(16:37) let's take a look at this i'm sorry i hate to call out my own party but the young girls on the right
(16:44) promoting this like tradife i just want to make sourdough for my husband that's great i'm all for it i
(16:51) promote traditional values i understand i have been working since I was very young i don't really plan on stopping
(16:57) working i suggest you find a hobby that makes you money but you guys guess what
(17:03) guess what baby girl that lifestyle working out a man a provider you just get to sit at home and bake bread every day slim to none i would say none that
(17:11) that's going to work out for you or quite literally anyone you know you're actually setting yourself up for failure
(17:17) because it could not be easier if that's what you're going to pursue to be trapped by a man okay also let's bring
(17:24) some other things to the table besides sourdough let's let's have guys want to be mentally stimulated as well as
(17:31) physical okay but I'm just like please you guys are too young to be promoting this and also by the way it's cringe you
(17:38) guys are cringe okay now Emily are you are you standing proudly by that Tik Tok
(17:47) um thank you guys for laughing uh that is supposed to be the point of a lot of my videos i don't take things too
(17:53) seriously i usually say things like this and don't think anything of it um I do want to point out in the video I did
(17:59) start it by being like look I love stay-at-home moms i support them i promote conservative values um I think
(18:05) the issue with the video is a lot of people just took the video and then gave their own meaning the group I was
(18:11) specifically bashing on was the young girls in their 20s that promote like traditional lifestyles online that we
(18:17) all know in the right-wing community absolutely do not live these lifestyles and it's just a bit over the top it's
(18:24) kind of more cosplay than anything so of course I support moms that do that i just don't support the girls pretending
(18:30) to do it i guess if that kind of makes sense i'm not sure it does andrew does it make sense to you well I mean she's
(18:37) right in a sense that there's a lot of laring that goes on on the right with the supposed traditional movement which
(18:43) she's absolutely right isn't living the traditional lifestyle however it's still a counterintuitive message to put out
(18:49) there that oh you're going to be trapped by your husband and his income it's like good don't you want to be in a
(18:55) relationship with your husband and have access to his income like what's the problem here that would be the values you're trying to move towards right so
(19:02) ultimately it's a contradicting message i understand why you got a bunch of garbage for it it is a good idea I think
(19:08) to point out the LAR a good idea to point out how much faux traditionalism
(19:13) is on the right because it's a way for them to pedal sex and that's exactly what they're doing you see them in skimpy outfits doing exactly that
(19:20) totally fair but on the other hand you absolutely should not be putting out a message which ridicules women for
(19:26) wanting to be stay-at-home moms and actually live some type of lifestyle which is conducive to their children and
(19:31) family that's silly let's play at this stage the clip i mean also trapped is just the wrong word to use but overall
(19:38) my message I stand by okay I want to play because I think it fits in well here the Caroline Levit clip this is uh
(19:45) where she's working with her baby we'll just show the picture of her working at the White House with a baby in one hand
(19:52) and helping to run the country with the other now when I first s saw that picture I thought "Wow that's a pretty
(19:57) extraordinary powerful image of a young woman who's very young to be doing the incredibly important job she does she
(20:03) does it I think extraordinarily well and she's a mother uh and she's feeding her
(20:09) son whilst doing this at the same time." Um Rachel when you saw that image it got a lot of blowback good and bad you know
(20:16) some people loved it some people hated it what did you think about it well I actually tweeted about this too because
(20:23) although I'm a big fan of Caroline as a person I think she's great she's smart she's lovely I don't understand this
(20:30) compulsion especially in the Trump administration but on the right in general where we're supposed to be conservatives where we are pushing
(20:37) mothers to work trump has been a huge proponent of hiring women getting women
(20:42) back to work as soon as possible after having the baby and I think this is a huge mistake because number one what are
(20:48) we conserving if we're not conserving the traditional family and traditional gender roles and motherhood in the in
(20:56) the middle of a birth rate crisis what are we conserving as conservatives just like lower taxes i mean this is should
(21:03) be a core issue for us on the right to say "No motherhood is not a part-time
(21:08) gig that you do on the side you don't you know ship your baby off to daycare where they're spending three times as
(21:14) much time with a low-wage daycare worker as they are with mom while you go and do your career there's plenty of life to
(21:20) live after raising kids i think after you've done that if you want to venture out and do a few more things once you
(21:27) have the empty nest I think that's okay but pushing mothers to work is it's one
(21:32) of the key things that's tearing apart the fabric of society because we're not raising our own children we're not
(21:37) passing down our values to them we're sending them to daycare and we're sending them to state-run schools and
(21:42) that's who they're being raised by all right Clementine your response to that
(21:49) do you work Rachel no you don't make any money from your
() 
(21:56) podcasting i make some money but I do I do you do
(22:02) some form of paid employment yes first of all my children are grown up now i'm
(22:07) 44 years old so I had my first one at 20 they're grown up they're moved out but I
(22:12) I work still very very part-time maybe a couple hours a week at most but do you
(22:17) have because my my primary ability is to my husband but do you you've got five children
(22:23) right is that correct and they're all grown up and all moved out or you've still got some young children at home
(22:30) the youngest couple at home and by the way just making an argument from hypocrisy can I just ask hypocrisy can I
(22:36) just ask you can I just ask you do you find even with the small amount of part-time work that you do which you do
(22:43) get paid for do you find satisfaction from that do you get satisfaction from
(22:48) that work it's not the money because Andrew makes far more than I make i make a very very tiny amount of money off of
(22:54) you know my book and a a couple appearances here and there might sell a few books it's it's practically nothing
(23:00) if I was doing it for the money it'd be a waste of even the couple of hours but what I would what I would say to that is
(23:07) we're not against women doing other things so if you look at the Bible and the Proverbs 31 woman she does a lot of
(23:13) things she's out buying land she's making decisions she's doing all kinds of things the difference is that she's
(23:19) doing them under the purview of the guidance and leadership of her husband and for her family not for a corporation
(23:26) not for her own glory not for her own ambition a lot of that depends on whether or not
(23:33) you whether or not you have faith in the Bible which obviously not everyone does um but the reason I asked asked you
(23:38) those questions wasn't because I was trying to set you up or anything like that it doesn't surprise me that you would get some satisfaction to me the
(23:45) point of the question wasn't about the money it's about the work it's about the the passion that you put into it and the
(23:52) reason I asked was because a multi-year study done by Adrienne Freck and Sarah De Damasque sorry found that the mental
(23:58) health of women who worked full-time after the birth of their first child was significantly higher than those who
(24:04) didn't have paid work at all so I think that taking into account the fact that for a lot of women and this is also what
(24:10) Betty Fredan found when she wrote the feminine mystique that and Stephanie Coots backed this up as well in her book
(24:15) The Way We Never Were which is a history of Are you married Clement i have no idea about your situation but are you
(24:20) married do you have kids what's What's your deal i've I've got a kid i'm not married okay but you have a I'm a I'm a
(24:27) single mother okay and I have a very excellent relationship with my son's father we co-parent together very well
(24:34) but we're not married we don't live together um I certainly have found since having a child I mean I' I've always
(24:40) worked anyway i've been working since I was 13 years old but I've always found that work for me is very satisfying and
(24:46) the with what I'm saying is that these are the findings of multiple historians anthropologist scientists that No these
(24:53) are the findings of diehard feminists who are only investigating this from a feminist point of view they're already
(24:59) sold on the ideology and what they do they cherrypick data she's a worldrenowned historian she's not
(25:05) specifically a feminist she's a worldrenowned historian and these are the these were her findings as well so
(25:11) you cannot deny the reality did I say that women can't do anything else we're
(25:17) not we're not saying women can never leave the house we're we're not saying you can't have other things in your life
(25:22) that you finding that you're suggesting that the primary role for a woman and
(25:28) that you know in your faith I'm not going to discredit that but your faith in God says that this is what you believe God says that you should be
(25:34) doing but that the primary role for a woman is that she should be staying at home that she should be devoted to her
(25:39) husband she should be devoted to her children the the facts do not back that up the facts of of famili familial
(25:46) satisfaction don't back that up hang on okay let me jump in hang on hang on yes they do hang on hang on hang on sorry
(25:52) Clementine i think you've chosen the wrong moment to say that you've clearly got a woman here on the panel but the
(25:59) facts completely back that up she's had a lot of kids very happily married i
(26:05) know that there would be exceptions to the rule but statistically speaking well you've just literally got one sitting there in front of That's completely
(26:12) untrue though to say that this one study that this one survey is going to tell us
(26:17) something first of all we have two years it was a multi-year stud let me let me ask you Clementine let me let me ask
(26:23) Clementine did when you were uh were you married or not i I can't remember what you said were you married no I've never
(26:29) been okay but when you were with your partner before you broke up who did the household chores and stuff like that i mean how did you delineate that as a
(26:36) feminist it was a struggle because even in lots of supposedly egalitarian households and
(26:44) you know again the data backs up that women even women who make more money than their partners or their spouses
(26:50) tend to do more unpaid domestic labor this is the this is who did who did most who did most of the domestic chores
(26:58) in my house me you did me okay and Rachel who does
(27:03) most of them in yours so that's the reality for Hang on hang on hang on the most rachel who does the who does who does the domestic stuff in your house
(27:09) Rachel i do absolutely all of it and the thing I want to say to So you're very similar i mean you it seems to me you're
(27:16) both I care I care far less about women's fulfillment in careers than I
(27:21) care about children and how they're being raised and I want her to justify to me why we should be paying low-wage
(27:27) daycare workers to raise our children rather than doing it ourselves how does it make sense to take your duty of
(27:33) motherhood and simply put it on a different random woman how does that system make sense why should women do
(27:39) that if you would if you would like to stay at home and raise your children that's fine you're not answering the
(27:46) question for it's a question of choice to be raised by a question of choice it's actually not worse it's not worse
(27:53) for children to be raised by working mothers that's also the the the facts
(27:58) back that up there is no there's no facts listen lady there are no children who are less happy that is not true
(28:05) there are no facts on planet earth that back up that single mother households have better outcomes that's one two
(28:11) outsourcing specifically
(28:16) hanging if you outsource the raising of your children you're already making yourself a single mother just so you
(28:22) know here's what's going on just that you understand outsourcing are you a single father because your wife let me
(28:29) finish lady lady excuse me don't call me lady can you let me finish can anybody
(28:34) finish a point can anybody finish a point or only you allowed to i'm trying to make
(28:40) one so if you outsource your children's raising to strangers answer Rachel's
(28:47) question and tell her how that makes more sense than having the child raised by their own biological mother actually
(28:54) answer well in my case it makes more sense because I need to make money to pay my
(29:01) bills to raise my child it makes what if you depended on your
(29:06) husband's income do you see the problem of how we end to finish now it's my turn
(29:12) to finish but actually again if you if you if you knew what you were talking
(29:18) about if you actually if you actually read anything about the the data on these things rather than just reaching
(29:24) into your gut for a feeling that feels the data show me the data that shows that if you
(29:30) outsource the data shows let me bring Emily in because Emily's been again Emily's been
(29:38) hanged by mothers who work are less happy than children raised Yes there is
(29:44) there's tons of I would never try and stop Rachel's so much overwhelming children that's her choice to do that is
(29:51) so it's not true that because that's her choice let me let me bring Emily in
(29:56) other women let me bring Emily in knows that emily was trying to say something you don't want your daughters and you don't want your daughters and your
(30:02) nieces being forced to stay at home to raise families i don't want to I don't want my
(30:08) kids to be forced to do anything no emily you wanted to say something yeah
(30:13) yeah no I mean look I'm not going to argue data with either of you guys i'm sure you know more than me but I can say
(30:18) that um my father is my hero and the most important person in my life and I didn't if I didn't have him and he
(30:25) wasn't in the household I don't know where I would be today and my girlfriends who were raised without
(30:30) fathers in the household I do see them struggle in different ways when it comes to dating and all these different things
(30:35) and it's funny because it's like he they do make a point like if there was a father in the household supporting you I
(30:41) think a lot of these issues wouldn't be what they are so I think there's points to both of these things okay let me ask
(30:47) Andrew andrew but supporting in what way is your name Andrew anyway go ahead Pierce yeah Andrew I was going to ask
() 
(30:53) Andrew when Rachel said that she does all domestic chores is there anything you do i mean do you you put the bins
(30:58) out do you you know the trash out i mean what what do you do do you do anything i don't do
(31:04) that's what I got for a little yard work but but not only that if something's yard work that's about it
(31:11) yeah cars need repairs something like that but I'm not going to do household chores that's what I got married for i don't want to do household chores not
(31:16) only that on top of that let's just point a couple things out she's absolutely wrong here's what the stats
(31:22) actually say that if a child is raised in a two parent household they're going to have way better outcomes and if they
(31:29) have a present mother who is more present with them they're going to have way better outcomes every single data
(31:34) point backs this up the outsourcing of children to public school especially for eight hours a day is absurd stop stop
(31:41) let me finish the point let me finish the point and then you can respond let me finish the point i've got to say 10
(31:48) minutes someone who doesn't like being interrupted you interrupt why is it that you won't let me finish the point your producer Pier telling me to
(31:55) interrupt if I disagreed with anyone take it up but I think I think what's what's changed since that text message
(32:02) is you've made a point of objecting to being interrupted so I don't think you can do that and yet keep interrupting so
(32:08) that's just the state of play why don't you practice what you preach and don't interrupt Andrew when he's trying to finish his point yeah so look I've just
(32:14) finished the point would he make a point he hasn't made one yet yeah i I just did i made multiple points all the data
(32:19) points are He's made the point that he doesn't respect his wife he's still not talking he didn't want to do
(32:25) anything he can't stop talking lady this is why it should say the 19th under that shirt you cannot even be quiet long
(32:32) enough to hear a counterpoint here's the counterpoints your the data you're citing you don't have any when it comes
(32:38) to outcomes for children when it comes to outsourcing their raising correct none none no show me any that shows that
(32:46) you sending your kids out which data are you sending would you stop so that I can finish no no tell me tell me i'm trying
(32:52) to at least finish the question yes yeah okay here's the thing one more time all
(32:58) data points to the fact that if you outsource the raising of your children especially when they're young you say
(33:04) all data you actually have to site it site any data that shows that show site
(33:09) any data ever that shows that you outsourcing the care of your child is good for the child any
(33:17) Yeah that's right nothing you got And Stephanie Coun doesn't say that you're lying through your Do you even know who
(33:22) Stephanie Coun is yes do you mean the feminist right here stephanie Co the feminist writer Stephanie you don't you
(33:28) see you clearly don't even know what you're talking about you you I can tell you you're not even interested you're
(33:33) not even interested enough in the topic you're not even interested enough to respect who's Stephanie Co let's make
(33:38) sure we got it right who's Stephanie Coons stephanie Coun is an historian
(33:44) worldrenowned historian into marriage and the structure and isn't a feminist right isn't a feminist i just want to
(33:50) make sure we're clear i don't I have no idea if she's a feminist or not i know that she's an Well then why would you try to make a reputation about what I'm
(33:57) saying i clearly you don't know enough about the topic right silly i'm only
(34:03) allowed to I'm only feminist i'm not allowed to reference historians is that we're only so If you have a historian
(34:10) who's also a feminist clearly only allowed to reference If you have a historian who's also a feminist they're c they're biased right that's Let me ask
(34:16) you Clementine clementine let me ask you so obsessed with whether or not she's a feminist clementine let me ask you a question because it would promote bias
(34:23) bias let me try and answer ask a question here clementine do do you hate men
() 
(34:29) no of course I don't hate men what an absurd reductive question why did you
(34:34) tweet that hang on i'm about to follow you why why in 2020 did you tweet the
(34:40) Corona virus isn't killing men fast enough i tweeted that in 2020 as a misguided
(34:46) tweet but it was actually much of a part of a long misguided tweet corona virus isn't killing men you say you don't hate
(34:54) men apologize for it peers you thought a deadly pandemic virus wasn't
(34:59) apologized to men again do it again you haven't apologized to me for saying that
(35:05) you want me to die from the Corona virus i would have to consider you a man to apologize you for that say you're sorry
(35:11) say you don't even know what a woman is what else you know what else are you a man Andrew i would like for her to
(35:18) apologize to me because I do not appreciate her saying that my own husband does not respect me of course he
(35:25) respects me he respects me as a mother and as a wife he treats me like gold who
(35:31) the hell are you to tell me if he respects me or not you wouldn't have to get paid for this if you had a husband i
(35:37) didn't say that he Where did I even You did you said he clearly doesn't respect his wife say that i heard you say you
(35:43) mean the the piece of that you're married to yeah he clearly doesn't respect you he said he talks about how
(35:49) he married you he doesn't He's not the piece of in this panel that would be you so you're the one listen let's
(35:57) get back to the topic here you're the one who is insisting that there's no data proving the topics that we I would
(36:04) genuinely hang on time out time out i would genuinely like to know you said it was misguided to say the coronairus
(36:11) wasn't killing men fast enough why would a terrible thing to say terrible thing to say no I understand you said that the
(36:17) Don't worry let me finish my question i do understand it's a terrible thing to say my my question my be amusement why
(36:22) would you say that because I was really frustrated with the
(36:28) articles that I was reading about how the pandemic was uh it was derailing women's workplace uh um it was derailing
(36:37) women's economic trajectories and there was a specific article that I had read about a woman who had founded her own
(36:43) company she was the CEO of it her husband had taken a sbatical prior to the pandemic and within two days of
(36:50) child care closing down he said I can't take care of the four-year-old and she quit her job to go home and look after
(36:56) the kid what's that got to do with you wanting more men to be killed and so that's one if you're gonna ask me the
(37:02) question then let me finish you know what Clementine when You know what Clementine when you tweet literally
(37:07) Coronairus isn't killing men fast enough i think I'm entitled to push you a little bit more than it was a bit
(37:12) misguided you're literally calling for the mass culling of men while simultaneously pretending you don't hate
(37:19) men come on you know you know that don't be disingenuous you know that that's not
(37:25) what I was calling for you did
(37:32) misinterp apologized for it shortly after that you know that I was sincere in my apologies you didn't apologize to
(37:37) me dragging it out 5 years later will you apologize to Andrew please will you apologize to me for saying you wanted me
(37:42) to die i'm I would not apologize to you if I did something to you let alone for
(37:48) doing nothing to you even if you could say something to me you wouldn't apologize was that the only time clementine hang on hang on hang on hang
(37:56) on hang on i've got a followup i have a followup clementine was that was that the only time you tweeted that that you
(38:01) want all men to be killed yes why don't you just say what you want
(38:07) to say no I'm just asking you a question have you Have you tweeted previously i have tweeted I have tweeted prior to
(38:13) that kill all men as a joke as a joke I have as a joke you quite regularly think
(38:18) it's funny to say that men should be killed i don't quite regularly there's two there's two examples that you can
(38:24) think of you don't hate men but you did tweet kill all men and then you tweeted the Coronirus isn't killing men fast
(38:29) enough i put it to you oh hang on i've also I put it to you you probably do hate mend
(38:37) i've also said that men should be fired into the sun tell me at what point do these very clearly glib and yes I have
(38:45) apologized for them very but very clearly glib tweets from a time as well
(38:51) where Twitter was such a toxic I don't tweet anymore it's a bad place for everybody
(38:56) at what point do those things be accepted as
(39:02) glib misguided regrettable deeply apologetic for them now remarks that you
(39:08) would never Say again you don't sound very apologetic i think you should just admit that you don't like men too i
(39:14) think it's the problem comes when you keep denying like you very much pierce I I don't care if you like me or not you
(39:20) spray gum me in public why couldn't give a damn why do I have to sit here and admit to you that I don't like men what
(39:26) What are you What are you hoping i just asked you if you do or not you said you you said you don't hate men you said that I did you spend all your time
(39:31) wanting us to be dead hang on she loves me you just got to shoot him in the stock you don't like me
(39:39) you think Andrew's a piece of so that's every single man involved with Mr bait is absurd every man every man in Mr
(39:47) bait Clementine you said you hate relationships with men you shouldn't be giving advice on it emily Emily what was
(39:53) that i hate I hate every saying if you live a life where you've been unsuccessful in relationships whether
(39:59) it's friendship love marriage whatever it is I think you're probably the last person in the position to be giving
(40:05) advice what women should do with men i mean I don't feel any animosity even when it comes to him
(40:12) successful in friendships and relationships that's a very single mom that's a very odd Well being a single
(40:19) mother doesn't mean that I'm unsuccessful in relationships i I already said before that I have a very beautiful co-parenting relationship with
(40:25) my son's father he lives in the same apartment building as us we're deeply close friends i don't I don't understand
(40:31) why you think that that is I'm not bitter towards men at all i'm I'm annoyed at uh I'm annoyed at the
(40:40) expectation that some men have some men on this panel have that women should do
(40:46) everything for them i'm certainly angry at the fact that in the UK does
(40:52) everything I do everything i am angry that in the UK a woman is killed every 3 days by a man
(40:59) i'm angry that in America three women are killed every day i don't that's kind of a
(41:07) differently one woman is killed every 10 minutes by
(41:12) an I'm angry about and I'm angry how many babies do you guys that one in
(41:18) three girls over the age of 15 will experience sexual violence in her lifetime i'm very angry about that
(41:23) statistic i'm angry about rape and sexual assault i'm angry about the fact that the most dangerous person to a
(41:29) woman is a man that she knows i'm angry about all of these things yes but that doesn't mean that I hate men that
(41:35) doesn't mean that I don't want to shoot them into the sun to prove for men's greatness with women and with you want
(41:42) to shoot men into the sun you want them killed by Corona virus and you want all of us dead and you hate both the men on
(41:48) the panel other than that you love men we get it you love them you love them they're great even though they're being a bunch of things which is that I hate
(41:55) Well this my thing is like can't you admit that you at least like men enough that they gave you a beautiful child
(42:01) you're super grateful of i mean that's a positive this is honestly the one of the most absurd
(42:07) conversations I've ever had in my life i've just sat here and explained that I hate men i've just sat here and
(42:13) explained that I have a wonderful relationship with my son's father i've just sat here and said you know that
(42:19) that I've apologized for these things that I've said in the past we've all said terrible things we've peers you've
(42:25) said terrible things on Twitter we've all said things and apologize for Hang on what have I said what have I said
(42:32) name one oh oh Pier do you want me to look them up right now okay let me let me just give me a second tell me a
(42:37) terrible thing I said on Twitter pierce Morgan while she's looking can I refute
(42:42) her fake statistics that she just gave because I hear feminist repeat there we go i'll look at that give me a terrible
(42:49) opinion rachel I thought you were talking while
(42:54) I'm just scrolling through the No no no we can all wait Clementine the clock is ticking though i mean find one terrible
(43:00) thing that I've tweeted oh I think that all lives matter was pretty bad you think all lives matter
(43:07) it's a bit better than men should be dying faster isn't it lives matter let's just compare all lives matter against
(43:14) more men should die faster all lives matter all lives matter as a rejection of black lives matter i didn't reject
(43:19) Black Lives Matter i didn't reject Black Lives Matter i didn't reject the I didn't reject Black Lives Matter the I
(43:27) didn't reject Black Lives Matter don't lie no but you didn't respond you see this is the
(43:32) trouble you say that I've said terrible things when you try and find them you don't have any i'm looking at it right
(43:39) here appears all lives matter he didn't say white lives matter he said all lives matter which is true in any decent do
(43:45) you not think all lives matter clementine it's absolutely ridiculous clementine do all lives matter
(43:51) i think that all lives deserve respect i think that in the context do all lives matter Clementine
