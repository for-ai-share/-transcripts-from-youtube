(0:00) you know leave it included so with that I'll turn it over to you Rob it's all yours finally someone with sense gets to
(0:06) talk here so this will be nice Welcome to The Crucible everyone the premier debate Channel online right now we got a
(0:13) good one for you tonight we have Andrew Wilson from The Crucible we'll be debating Dave Smith who for me most
(0:20) famous this week for shattering Andrew Cuomo's dreams and yeah good job by the way Dave job if you have not seen it
(0:28) it's a banger it's an alltime please check that out I'm excited fans of both of these guys think it's going to be a
(0:33) fantastic debate they're going to be going on libertarianism is it better than Christian populism I think there's going
(0:39) to be a lot to say some agreements but who likes those let's get to disagreements I think it'll be great
(0:45) they're going to have seven minute openings which we'll start with Andrew and then we'll go into about an hour and
(0:50) 15 minutes a general discussion followed by some closings it'll be seven minutes and then we're going to get to questions
(0:56) from the audience so any Super Chat you put in we'll try to get to all of those and then please be watching the
(1:02) moderators in the chat they're going to give you instructions to how you could call in so look for the chat the
(1:07) moderators that'll be talking about that and we plan on taking a hefty amount of Callin so it's G to be a good one you
(1:12) want to get involved in this ask either guy question make fun of them we all have thick skin just don't make fun of
(1:18) the moderator I guess he's perfect you can't make fun of him but other than that looking forward to it um why don't
(1:23) we just jump in I don't think either of you really need that much of an introduction so Andrew is the Challenger
(1:29) you get to go first you have up to seven minutes for your opening statement whenever you're ready sure uh you guys
(1:34) can hear me okay yep okay great uh well thank you Dave for coming into tonight's
(1:40) debate I appreciate it I want to let you know the reason I'm having this debate with you is because I think I can bring
(1:46) you to the duck side of the force and uh you're already halfway there my hope is
(1:53) to convince you to get to the rest of the way there libertarianism is in the end a system which inevitably leads to
(2:01) degeneracy the reason Libertarians currently have a skittles nominee for president is because the very ideology
(2:08) itself is corrupt it starts with the very core idea on which all of their ideas are based which is self- ownership
(2:15) I know this is a doctrine that Mr Smith does believe H because I have seen him
(2:21) reference it multiple times in multiple appearances most recently on reason TV in his case against open borders to
(2:28) failing Dogma because it opens up the ultimate can of worms people really do own themselves
(2:34) then we really can't engage with any voluntary actions they take with each other and stop them overrule them or
(2:42) force them not to do those actions this is exactly why Skittles in society
(2:48) exists by this logic we can't Outlaw incest prostitution we can't Outlaw gay
(2:53) marriage we can't Outlaw polygamy we can't even Outlaw unal living yourself
(2:58) all things which Christian ethics point to is absolutely immoral Dave can't
(3:04) really say that they are though they have to be allowed if you own yourself or it would be a violation of the
(3:11) self-ownership doctrine it's nice and all that Mr Smith has distance himself from the failure
(3:17) that is the modern libertarian party and I applaud him for doing it but ultimately the very reason he had to is
(3:23) because of this reason it always leads to the Absurd outcome of mass degeneracy it has to there's no way around it Dave
(3:31) assumes for reasons I don't understand that his solution of nonpromotion yet legalization somehow better than the
(3:38) alternative of the state utilizing authority to remove these moral plagues
(3:43) I want the state busting up prostitution rings and pimps I want them arresting incest practitioners and I want them to
(3:49) arrest polygamist I want them to use Force to prevent unal living of oneself
(3:55) the anarcho capitalist in this C case Dave can't just ify the state really doing any of those things the Christian
(4:02) ethicist can striking a key balance between what he would call totalitarianism and what are considered
(4:09) freedoms for us though Mr Smith has outlined a plan one he often repeats his
(4:15) plan is to have Libertarians move into positions of governance in order to take control of Key Systems and then abolish
(4:21) them eventually in hopes that we eventually get to some kind of anarcho
(4:27) capitalist Society over time he says this because quote the perfect
(4:33) is the enemy of the good this means of course that because a thing isn't perfect doesn't mean we shouldn't move
(4:39) to what's better even if what's better isn't perfect so that the audience knows
(4:45) this is also the exact plan of socialists they also want to seize government institutions abolishing power
(4:51) over time in order to end up with a stateless society just like Dave wants it's amusing to note that ultimately
(4:57) what both sides are really fighting over is the power of the state and the use of its Force it's hilarious to me that
(5:03) Christians have fallen for any libertarian Dogma at all we have every right to rule as much as a secist and
(5:09) the right to wield state power how we see fit to exercise our will just as the libertarian Mr Smith wants to do himself
(5:16) and as the socialists want to do uh Mr Smith definitely can't argue we shouldn't as if traditional Christians
(5:23) were in power society would certainly be better than it is now and well if it's
(5:29) not perfect well Perfection is the enemy of the good Christian ethics is a superior system of
(5:36) justification starting points which reject libertarian axioms including that of self- ownership on which the
(5:43) non-aggression principle must base itself I'd like to see Dave demonstrate for us that self-ownership is true I'm
(5:51) willing to be convinced but thus far I most certainly am not I'd like him to finally clarify his oughts and if incest
(5:57) ought be allowed if it isn't reproductive if homosexual marriage ought be allowed if polygamist marriages
(6:04) ought be allowed and if unal living yourself ought be allowed anytime in the past I have seen Dave pushed on these a
(6:11) claims he's somewhat evasive and dodgy and I think it's time to get clear positions and note what he actually does
(6:17) want in society not as preferences go but as his ought of self- ownership demand people be allowed to do with no
(6:25) evasion tell us what is true that you do believe prostitutes ought to be able to
(6:31) be prostitutes if they want that those who want to un alive ought be able to do that that polygamist ought be able to
(6:37) marry as many people as they want that Skittles people ought be able to get married that drug use ought to be legal regardless of the drug I'd like to get
(6:44) into these distinct philosophies I think that's enough for us to start with and
(6:49) with that I'll yield my time to Dave okay all right Dave whenever you're ready go ahead you got up to seven
(6:55) minutes sure so as I said uh I I was uh I'll make my opening a bit of a response
(7:01) to yours because I I'm just uh meeting you guys tonight and I didn't exactly know what I was in for but I will say
(7:09) that um I know Andrew uh I I have seen on Twitter you uh in your bio you refer
(7:16) to yourself as a Paleo conservative and that I I would just say sorry were you
(7:21) gonna say something oh no sorry uh I would just say that I'm very interested
(7:28) in the energizing of that term and that there are people who consider themselves
(7:34) paleo conservatives today I'm a big uh let's just say I was very influenced and
(7:41) I've read a lot of paleo conservative thinkers uh Paul godfried Pat Buchanan Sam Francis guys like this one of the
(7:48) things that I think was uh great about all of those guys was that they all the the term paleo conservative actually
(7:54) came from hearkening back to the old right which were a group of anti-state
(8:00) right- wiers back who were you know fighting the New Deal and fighting
(8:05) keeping America out of World War I and out of World War II um I I would just
(8:12) say in response to some of the things you said there the idea of uh libertarianism and self-ownership does
(8:19) not at all imply that anyone is allowed to do whatever they want to do and it certainly doesn't imply that you can't
(8:25) say something is horrifically immoral even if it doesn't violate the princip of self- ownership um certainly property
(8:33) rights would be a great example of where someone wouldn't be allowed to do whatever they want to do if they were on
(8:39) someone else's property who didn't wish to allow them to do that I think that a
(8:44) lot of the um the later stuff I I we' probably have to get into in the back
(8:50) and forth and when we're asking each other questions I think there are lots
(8:55) of examples of degeneracy that you could bring up and ask whether I think we ought to be allowed to do them or not
(9:02) the question to me Isn't So Much whether we ought to be allowed to do them it's
(9:07) how Society ought to treat them and what exactly has led us to the point where
(9:12) these awful things are so celebrated so I'm I'm sure there'll be more time to
(9:17) get into all of these things but I would just say that I think from what I'm hearing at the beginning here there's a
(9:23) big misunderstanding of what exactly it is I stand for and also what kind of the
(9:29) tradition of resisting centralized authoritarian control is really all
(9:35) about but I'm happy to talk more about this all right opening statements done
(9:42) so I'm gonna try to stay out of it as much as possible we'll let you two go back and forth you only hear from me if the audience can't hear because there's
(9:49) too much talking over each other other than that got about an hour and 15 hour 20 minutes you guys go ahead Dave can
(9:55) can you demonstrate for us how you own yourself well I uh what exactly do you mean by that do you own
(10:03) yourself yes can you demonstrate that I mean I'm demonstrating we're both demonstrating it right now on this show
(10:11) well you're not demonstrating that you own yourself that what do you mean by own well I think that ownership of a
(10:18) thing is a just a social construction that ownership itself is just a parameter of agreed upon um criteria for
(10:28) hang on let me finish the for that's how we know so I own that guitar CU we agree that I own that
(10:33) guitar that's it that's the only reason I own it I don't think that there's anything which is that you can point to
(10:41) that would demonstrate that this exists outside of a social construction we agree to okay well I'm I'm missing your
(10:48) point here my point is is that I think it's a social construction when you say that you own yourself I don't think I I
(10:54) didn't say it's not a social construction but well then do you don't own yourself
(10:59) that's a false binary I'm not hold on one second listen no no no that's a law of logic you either do or you don't no I
(11:05) didn't say no you're you're asking me if I do or I don't do you own that
(11:10) guitar yeah okay but you just said it's a social construct yeah but I gave you
(11:16) the criteria for the social construct and I said I own myself when
(11:22) so as much as you own that guitar you've Pro this is incorrect when I say do you own yourself and you say I'm not sure
(11:28) love meish said yes yeah the law of excluded middle is going to show this it can only
(11:36) be yes or no do you have self- ownership yes or no I own the guitar because we agree we do do you only own yourself
(11:42) because we agree you do well I no I don't agree that that's what ownership means but you said yes and I said yes so
(11:48) we're both exactly even in terms then I want to know what then I want to know how you own yourself well look if you
(11:55) actually look up ownership in like a dictionary I think the definition that you gave would be a little bit different
(12:00) than that so do I exercise my uh control over myself do I do so morally yes I
(12:07) think so and I I actually think that in order for us to even have this conversation we both have uh in a sense
(12:14) agreed to that principle I don't think we have we it's me verse you do you how
(12:20) we how we you own the arguments that you're making so far in this conversation you don't how do you own an argument no I mean when I say that I
(12:28) mean is it yours are the words it came out of my mouth the words you're saying your but how
(12:34) would that how would that make the application that I own that thing well look again Define own I think that o the
(12:42) definition of ownership would be a social construct in which you and I via
(12:48) agreement criteria decide that X thing becomes property which is assigned to me
(12:55) okay yeah by that definition do you own yourself I would say by the by the
(13:02) definition of that social construction I I could say that you own yourself sure oh okay but that doesn't mean anything
(13:09) let me explain why because if the social we just do this whole time let me explain because if the social
(13:15) construction what if we change the social construct and we decide that you can own a person Dave right okay and
(13:21) what if we change the social construct and says I own your guitar and I own you what you that's exactly right what if we
(13:28) change the social construction of ownership to mean you can own a person does that mean that people no longer own
(13:33) themselves well the the difference here right is that and and it's the word that I uh mentioned that you didn't is that I
(13:40) would say that ownership could would imply that you're
(13:46) you're justified in that claim how are you justified in that claim how am I justified in the claim of
(13:53) owning myself yeah you just said if you agreed it's a social construction so if we agree that it's a social construction
(13:59) we can own other people as via social construction that would be justified
(14:04) well I don't think so so the the major difference there right is that as we're
(14:10) having this conversation and clearly what what's the goal here to persuade
(14:16) probably not to persuade each other but at least to persuade the audience who's listening to us because we what we
(14:23) recognize that they are in control forget the word own because that's triggering evidently but they are not
(14:30) triggered by the word own okay when I say triggering meaning that's going to
(14:35) start a whole another debate about semantics so yeah but semantics are important in the debate okay well all
(14:42) right let's not do this tactic of interrupting every two seconds so let me just finish my point here so we are both
(14:49) presuming that the people who are listening to this are in control of their own thoughts and we could
(14:55) potentially p uh potentially persuade them toward our cause and so if we're doing all of this we
(15:02) kind of are recognizing in some sense that it's more valuable to persuade people than it is to I don't know just
(15:10) enforce our will on them and so in that sense I would say that yes there is some
(15:17) kind of uh Norm that there is a
(15:22) justifiable path where you can persuade people vers force them sure well I agree that you can persuade all sorts of
(15:29) people and that that can be part of a societal norm and that everybody can agree that that's part of a societal Norm that does not demonstrate that you
(15:36) own yourself thus the principle the key principle for the non-aggression principle which is self-ownership
(15:41) that's where the violation comes in do people own themselves is that a
(15:47) Justified position or isn't it I I'm saying that yes I think it is but again
(15:53) can you demonstrate it well what what would you mean by that what would it mean to demonstrate that you you have to
(16:00) prove that you own yourself that I can control myself or
(16:05) what again just be clear about what you're asking well here let me give you an example yeah I'll give you I'll give
(16:10) you an example to the contrary I have seen throughout all of human history that human beings seem to be able to own
(16:16) other human beings without much problem that doesn't seem to be a problem as long as the social construction of
(16:22) ownership of the time states that you can own another person you seem to be able to just fine right so this Axiom of
(16:29) self- ownership is not obvious to me to be an an axom It has to be self-apparent
(16:34) and self obvious so what so what demonstrated that people owned other people throughout time prove that to me
(16:41) the same way the same way you just said to me prove to me that I own myself did I did no no no hold on I'll prove it to
(16:47) you again well well hold on let's try to not we're only a couple minutes you you interrupted me I didn't interrupt you
(16:52) well hold on you're you just asked me to prove that I own myself and then you asserted that throughout history people
(16:59) owned other people so prove that yeah but we already did and let me explain how you and I already agreed that
(17:06) ownership is a social construction and that throughout history this social construction had changed where people
(17:12) were able to own other people via the social construct so whatever the social construct is of the day that's all it is
(17:19) if as long as you agree that ownership is a social construction you basically have to bite that bullet right wait no
(17:25) I'm not even understanding what you're saying here so we agreed it was a social construct and then your next statement
(17:31) after that was prove to me that you own yourself a social construction doesn't exist in objective reality
(17:37) right so prove to me that anyone ever owns someone else throughout history and all you said was it was a social
(17:43) construct as well you mean like you mean like a contract of ownership between slaves or something no it's your
(17:49) question so you tell me how to answer yeah my claim my claim is that ownership is a social construction do you agree or
(17:54) disagree with that claim uh I think it is a social construct but there also can
(18:00) be ethical and non-ethical or moral and immoral well if you make the assertion that it's anything more than a social
(18:07) construction then the burden of claim is on you to demonstrate how it could be
(18:12) well okay I mean again you're dodging my question here I asked you the same question you asked me and you weren't
(18:18) able to answer it either part of the reason by the way part of the reason why I asked is because I don't exactly
(18:23) understand the question you're asking me are you asking me to say why I think how I could prove that it is moral that one
(18:30) person should own themselves rather than someone else own them is that question that's not that's not the question the question so here's the question let me
(18:36) explain it to you okay the non-aggression principle itself revolves around the idea that human beings own
(18:42) themselves correct yes yes okay so the thing is is that you and I can agree that there's
(18:49) been tons and tons of slavery throughout human history correct okay so those
(18:55) people clearly own these other people so this has to be a social constru ruction of agreement is what is ownership we
(19:01) agree that you own it therefore you own it what I'm asking for is some type of Justified evidence that that is not the
(19:08) case and that there is some moral ought or some type of demonstration philosophically or otherwise that a
(19:14) human being actually owns thems okay so just to be clear here if
(19:20) if I were to say if you're saying ownership meaning just strictly
(19:27) control over who who has something then yes there have there have been lots of
(19:33) times where people can come just take all your stuff and then claim they own it and if you're saying the law
(19:39) recognizes it or the society recognizes it then essentially they own it so they can do that with people too right right
(19:46) and in a sense I agree with you and that then you don't own yourself okay let me
(19:51) just finish what I'm saying okay go ahead right I mean dude we got a lot a long uh show here so let's just let
(19:58) other talk so in a sense I agree with you yes you can take possession of something I don't think anybody is
(20:05) arguing that and I don't think it's a very impressive point to make that yes people can take possession of something
(20:11) and that could be codified by law or Society what we're talking about is like
(20:18) is something slightly different which has Justified ownership over something so then the claim is like whether it's
(20:24) morally right that you own this or not fair enough and I'm sure looking for the demonstration of what is
(20:30) morally right sure sure well okay if you're looking for the demonstration of what is morally right I'm sure there's lots of areas where you would believe
(20:37) something is morally right and something else is wrong and the demonstration of it would be what that this is what you
(20:43) believe this is what seems to be right and wrong this is what has been accepted and no my justification would be divine
(20:49) command not seemings or phenomenal conservatism which what seemings so okay but So Divine command so what and and
(20:56) how would you exactly uh determine what is and isn't Divine command let's assume for a second that I
(21:04) was um I don't know like delirious right and uh and just thought I talked to God
(21:10) and he gave me commands right uh if it's just preference if we're just going off of preference just things which Dave
(21:17) prefers are true and Dave just prefers that you own yourself because he does
(21:22) then any preference that I came up with in this Delirious state where God was speaking directly to me would be just as
(21:28) valid as what ever preference that you just axiomatically come to because you just want them to be true what my claim
(21:34) here is that libertarianism at its foundation at its fundamental Foundation
(21:40) is flawed because this Axiom of self-ownership isn't actually true but
(21:46) rather a social construction which is asserted as though it is a truism when
(21:51) it it clearly is not so that's it's a fundamental flaw the reason that you guys come up with such absurd
(21:57) conclusions like that prostitution ought to be legal and all these other things is and by the way Dave you have to end
(22:04) up with that otherwise people don't own themselves do you think the state should come in and like you know stop your
(22:09) brother from unal living himself for instance do you think that they should do that well hold all right stick with
(22:14) your point that you were making it first cuz you're just jumping all around here the first thing you were saying I already gave you the point I'm saying I
(22:21) reject your a i reject the Axiom of self- ownership until otherwise demonstrated that's my point okay so
(22:28) what would so you're saying that if some I'm sorry I'm just trying to understand the first part that you're saying here CU I'm not
(22:34) getting it at all so you're saying if somebody hallucinated that something was
(22:39) right and wrong and it was horrifically not right and wrong that somehow that disproves the idea that anything is
(22:45) right or wrong if it's only axiomatic and based on preference it would be just as how you determine if anything is
(22:51) morally right or wrong if it's from a preference base you couldn't okay so how do you determine that anything is
(22:57) morally I do it from Divine command you do it from preference I'm me you do from
(23:03) Divine command what does that mean explain that so this means that I follow Christian eth or ethics I use
(23:09) transcendental categories inside philosophy to create justifications for the values which come from God's laws
(23:15) that's what I that's a lot of words to not say anything how do you determine youal do you know what transcendental C
(23:22) I don't understand the words expl sounds like you don't understand okay explain it to me like I'm really stupid I don't
(23:28) understand any of the words so explain it to me how do you determine if something is right and wrong okay so we
(23:34) what I would do to make these determinations is we start with objective versus subjective what if is
(23:39) it a subjective value or is it an objective value if we start with it just being a subjective value then who cares
(23:45) we never need to go any further than that and we just never need to go any further for justification so what I've
(23:51) determined is that your values here in libertarianism are subjective value based therefore there's no never reason
(23:58) for me to justify anything objectively to you because any subjective preference
(24:03) I have is just as valid you're not answering my question at all literally that's the most precise answer you could
(24:10) ever get if you're how do you determine if something is right or wrong divine command and then I asked you what that
(24:17) means and you said nothing no you didn't you just said that you think my uh my
(24:23) basis is okay fine Dave I'll make it super simple cuz God tells me so is that better for you sure no that's the answer
(24:30) that's that's the answer God tells God tells you like and and through what means does God tell you this he directly
(24:36) communicates right into my brain he's like that shit's wrong okay yeah all right so but okay so the but the okay so
(24:43) just to be clear the point of that is that Andrew it sounds very good when you
(24:49) attack someone and say that's subjective but when your response to that is God
(24:55) communicates directly into my brain that also I mean I don't know what the word
(25:00) is for that subjective would subjetive would but that's my whole point that's how I'm granting your entire argument
(25:06) it's like it doesn't matter ultimately objective but you your counter is also subjective so right so then that means
(25:12) that my preference is no worse than your own preference well I mean no it means by your argument we're yeah I'm using
(25:21) preference yeah if I'm using preference-based arguments or I'm sorry preference-based morality and you're
(25:26) using preference-based morality listen then we're we're equal Dave to be clear I don't think I am using
(25:32) preference-based morality got it so can you can you make justification one second let me again let me try to finish
(25:38) the sentence here I don't think I am making subjective based morality but you
(25:44) accused me of that and so my response to you is so what's your objective base and
(25:49) your response is God talks to me directly into my head yeah for the purpose of demonstration all right by
(25:55) the way God also talks to me in my head and so all right fine all right so so
(26:01) God so if God your own standard you haven't won anything by your own standard we're even it's not here to win
(26:07) it it's here to demonstrate I want to try to let's let's try if we can because we're only a few minutes into this let's
(26:13) try this got more contentious than I thought it would in the first few minutes let's try to just by the way because I want to have a good
(26:19) conversation with you and I've been told by people who I love and trust that you were a guy to have a good conversation
(26:25) but you keep on evading every question that I have for you oh I all right I don't think I have but
(26:30) so let's so let's answer ask me a direct question I'm happy to answer should the state come in and stop your brother from
(26:36) unal living himself or not Dave I would want them to yes yes would you want the
(26:41) state to stop uh a a man from having sex with his sister if it would lead to a
(26:48) non-reproductive act Christ um wait if it would lead to a
(26:54) non-reproductive act she has no uterus but that was supposed to be worse than if it would would reproduce yeah it
(27:00) would be wor it would be less wor I'm just saying that seemed like an unnecessary caveat to throw on there but
(27:05) okay uh I wait Jesus Christ but what you're talking about like
(27:11) adults or children adults okay fine because for children obviously that'd be
(27:17) um yeah I guess I would want them to okay so you want the state to utilize
(27:23) Authority well not just the state I would want anyone okay so so I don't with the force to do it or anyone with
(27:29) the strength to do it so then those people don't own themselves no I don't think that's the
(27:35) conclusion well if they own themselves can you demonstrate what they're doing wrong oh sure okay but that's a that's a
(27:43) very silly and very um look this is this is a very like a um childish interpret
(27:51) interpretation of libertarianism you're still not answering the question you're just no I no I did I immediately
(27:57) answered question and now I'm responding to the point you made so I immediately
(28:02) said yes anyone with the authority to do it please stop or the power to do it please stop and then I was responding to
(28:09) what you said so I did answer the question what I'm saying is that the idea that if you own yourself and this
(28:15) is the fundamental mistake that you made at the beginning therefore I can't say anything is a moral is ridiculous and
(28:24) not in only in the libertarian worldview but in any any worldview there are lots
(28:30) of things I'm sure in yours where there could be things that you
(28:35) don't think are illegal but you still or or or you don't think should be illegal
(28:40) but you still think are wrong so that doesn't mean anything if I if I think people own themselves I can't think
(28:46) there's something horribly wrong about this that's not the point so let me I'll explain again okay sure so please if if
(28:53) you want the state to go in if a brother is banging a sister and she can't reproduce
(28:58) there I don't know how you could demonstrate why does why does reproducing matter in this I'm I'll explain I'll explain why so that you
(29:05) can't Bank on reproduction is being a harm because it could have like some kid who's all [ __ ] up so I'm just taking
(29:10) that out of the equation okay okay I gotta I'm just taking that out of the equation right she has no uterus they can't reproduce or maybe they're
(29:16) homosexuals right and they're just related if they own themselves and they're adults that is exactly what you
(29:22) would make the argument for for gay marriage they're they're adults these adults uh are are consenting with each
(29:27) other can you actually justify why that's wrong sure then justify why it's wrong
(29:35) well I can justify why it's wrong okay there's two separate questions here and this is almost like I I think what you
(29:41) need to pick apart so look could I there's two questions one is could I
(29:47) justify someone using Force to stop them and then there's could I justify why
(29:53) it's wrong you get where those are two different things yeah I'm just asking why it's wrong yeah yeah yeah sure sure
(29:58) sure that okay can I just do you get why those are two different things though
(30:04) you get the point I'm making yeah sure so can he answer the question now yeah dude uh listen man do you want to like
(30:11) have a a decent back and forth here or like do you want to not you're still not answering the
(30:17) question okay can you justify why it's actually wrong for two consenting yeah
(30:22) yeah yeah see the thing is I am answering the question you're just kind of being a dick and trying to win the debate to answer the question Dave all
(30:31) right give a chance is that is that actually like does anyone listening to this think this makes for like good
(30:36) debate tactics no no you actually are not like recognizing that there's a difference between these two things so
(30:43) told I do let's leave do you guys want to do this man I I [ __ ] like honestly D
(30:50) this is you talked we've talked way more than I have Dave I just want you to answer my question can you justify it or not bro yeah okay um so anyway I'll go
(30:59) back to saying do you guys want to do this do you guys want to like do a show here or like what do we what's the point
(31:04) of this you want I asked you specifically if you wanted a conversation or debate you said debate
(31:09) we're debating no no no I didn't say that I said we could do whatever you want to do yeah so we're doing a debate
(31:15) so let's not do a meta conversation just answer the question a debate doesn't mean you talk over me every time I try
(31:20) to answer want you to answer the question no I understand you do and I was but you're here's what we're
(31:28) Dave can expound here on what he thinks is occurring here in this debate and then before you come back in Andrew
(31:35) we'll give Dave a chance to specifically answer the question that you've asked so Dave's gonna do two things ask me ask me
(31:41) the question again I'm sorry can you justify why two consenting adults who are brother and sister having sex is
(31:48) morally wrong yes then do it okay because I
(31:53) think it's uh for the same reason you would think I think it's against nature it's evil it just seems horrible I don't
(32:00) know do you have a better answer for why it's wrong well yes Divine command Divine
(32:06) command okay fine so I also say Divine command that's why it's wrong well but but then this axum then the axom of self
(32:13) ownership would be wrong no it wouldn't no it wouldn't and if you had listened to me when I was responding the first
(32:20) time you would understand here let me now make my argument back if they don't
(32:25) if they don't own themselves right or they do own themselves rather and they're two consenting adults just like
(32:31) two homosexuals consenting adults why is it actually wrong for them to do that
(32:37) you say because it seems like it's against nature which is the natural fallacy couldn't I just apply that to homosexuals as well and say well it
(32:43) seems like it's against nature yeah sure maybe you could and do you think so your
(32:49) moral ODS are based around just things that grossy out no divine intervention
(32:54) bro Divine command yeah there you go so if it's divine command then you're going to abandon libertarianism and you're
(33:01) going to come over to Christian ethics right no no but I thought you made your
(33:07) justification based on Divine command so okay listen it's clear that
(33:13) it's clear that great Point dude you're right I I've you have Divine command and
(33:18) I you're asking me why it's wrong for a brother to [ __ ] a sister what's listen dude I know like uh I don't know
(33:24) anything about you I don't know why Jacob thought this was going to be a good idea I know you like dominate
(33:29) 20-year-old uh like only fan [ __ ] in debates I also dominate 45y old comedians in debates what's your point
(33:36) 41 [ __ ] and uh listen and no you're really not though you're asking
(33:42) questions about why it's wrong for a brother to [ __ ] a sister oh okay I I don't know uh because I think it's wrong
(33:50) and yes awful and also do I think that the government if we're talking about adults is it being outlawed going to be
(33:57) a great way to regulate that probably not what what even is your like Vision I
(34:03) mean this is like the dumbest [ __ ] question to get into like what the role of government ought to be yes you're
(34:09) right if the FBI is breaking in and stopping brother uh 25 year-old and
(34:14) 28-year-old brothers and sisters from having sex with each other that's okay
(34:20) that's we we need the government to do that I say you no they do that right now are you opposed to it they actually arrest people for doing this and they
(34:26) drag them off to jail and they put in jail I'm not nearly as aware of this as
(34:33) you are Andrew but I'm not going to fight against that law yeah but here's but here's the thing then I what I don't
(34:39) understand is that if the argument for self-ownership is that consenting adults
(34:45) can do whatever it is they want to do uh because their consenting adults are not hurting anybody else this would be a
(34:50) violation of the non-aggression principle why couldn't a brother and a sister engage in this in Dave's
(34:56) libertarian land why couldn't they why shouldn't they be able to honestly sure um so well why shouldn't they do it is
(35:04) for moral reasons I suppose you could make an argument that if people really do have freedom then a grown you know
(35:13) like grown adults who are related should not be banned by law and should not have
(35:20) uh a cop bash him over the head with a baton for like having sex with a cousin
(35:25) or something okay but you're taking this to like this weird extreme example where
(35:32) that happens now oh sure okay anyway so you're taking this to a weird extreme example where okay let's take it to the
(35:38) other extreme and say do you believe that um the government should rush into
(35:45) your house anytime you're doing anything where they they determine that that's
(35:50) degenerate or not moral or productive you're smoking a cigarette right now is that enough of a reason for someone to
(35:57) come get you like would there be any realm where you would say maybe the government shouldn't
(36:02) be regulating every inch of what I determin from Divine you know whatever
(36:08) that is moral or immoral yeah so actually this makes my point for me this is great so the reason that I just uh go
(36:16) ahead and concede a lot of these points because there's no real reason to fight them for instance if you agree with me
(36:22) that the only justification that you can have is that well because God told you it's gross and so therefore you to not
(36:28) do it then this would mean that you agree with me in Divine command and should be a Christian ethicist that's
(36:33) why that's done that's why I just make it simp super easy for you to go ahead and agree and and you did you agreed
(36:39) absent so I'm just going to ask this straight out okay and no I don't believe in that sort of government overreach and
(36:45) I can give you my systems and reasons for why that is too under Christian ethic uh or Christian ethics where we
(36:51) both take into account consequence but also take into account Duty so I'm going
(36:56) to ask this s any kind of divine command God didn't tell you
(37:02) anything would you say that it's not moral and can you justify why it's not
(37:08) moral for a brother to hump his sister could you do that absent Divine command
(37:13) like honest question Dave this is super important sure sure sure um so I would say this right I um I grew up an atheist
(37:25) well I mean I I I'm Jewish but I grew up like not a religious person it was just
(37:31) you know kind of my what I was born into and I was pretty
(37:36) much an atheist for most of my life um and then I had some experiences as I
(37:43) became a young adult that made me think about God and kind of get in touch with him and then it was really when I had my
(37:49) first child that I really found God so I would agree with you that yes there
(37:56) is something from God that instructs me as to what is right and wrong in this world however before I
(38:04) ever believed in God yeah there was just a deep feeling inside of me that that would have been very wrong and I do
(38:11) believe that that was always from God okay so then so then absent God what
(38:17) that proves so then abent God nothing in this argument it it does though and I'm going to explain how I'm going to
(38:22) explain how because you're saying that absent God is just your preferences it's just how you feel no that's what
(38:28) moral or not what would make it immoral AB God see here's the thing dude Andrew
(38:33) I think you're doing a thing here that a lot of like internet Blood Sport Debaters try to do which is that you're
(38:40) trying to win before you're actually listening to what I'm saying I can steal man the entire thing like try to listen
(38:46) to what I actually said and grapple with that what I said was not before I
(38:51) believed in God it was just subjective what I said was before I believed in God
(38:57) I always had this feeling and what I believe is that was always God I okay
(39:03) Point that's a very different thing what you said right sure so I'll just steal man the position the position to make
(39:09) sure I don't get this wrong at all is that you believe that there was some type of natural law given to you by God
(39:16) before you ever even believed in God correct yeah I think that's accurate great great so I steal man the position
(39:22) has so to my question which you didn't actually answer sure which is this absent God if there was no God could you
(39:31) justify why this would be immoral or not yeah I don't know that you could I I
(39:36) mean I think that I think absent I think absent God it's very difficult to arrive
(39:43) at morality right so absent God so you're Divine command as well Divine
(39:48) command theorist just like myself so if that's true and you're Divine command theorist and we have now shown how self-
(39:56) ownership leads to absurd conclusions like a brother being able to hump their sister no but I disagree with okay well
(40:02) okay why why can't if you own yourself why can't you hump your sister if she owns herself Dave that makes no sense
(40:08) what it there's no what do you mean by why can't you why can't if you if you
(40:14) don't own yourself why can't you hump your sister what does that mean good question that's my but my point is with
(40:20) the non-aggression principle the entire a you're not asking anything dude so you
(40:26) okay so let's just just say this and man I wish you had picked an example that wasn't so [ __ ] uncomfortable to talk
(40:32) about but here you so you Andrew don't
(40:38) own yourself why can't you just hump your sister you could exactly so what
(40:44) the hell are you asking what's the question but that's my but that's but that goes to my point I think that if
(40:50) you actually have self-ownership as something more than an axiom meaning
(40:56) it's Justified somehow that you actually do own yourself it's not just a social construction then you wouldn't be able
(41:02) to hump your sister if you did not own yourself right what do you mean wouldn't be but if you if you do own yourself you
(41:09) can still hump your sister the point being Andrew do you own yourself uh under the current Paradigm
(41:16) of the social construction we would say yes okay but so if and and if you didn't
(41:22) you wouldn't be able to hump your I I don't get no you still could but that that is the point it so you still could
(41:28) so what are you saying so let me try again just listen to what I'm saying like I just did your in fact maybe you
(41:34) can steal man this for me maybe like I just did for you let me let me listen and I'll see if I can so my point is is
(41:40) that self-ownership is why you should not be allowed to aggress against another person because they own themsel
(41:48) correct okay is is that correct is that isn't that the basis of the nap you own
(41:53) you I own me that's why we cannot aggress against you each other correct sure okay got it and yet here we're both
(42:01) talking about using State authority to aggress against people who own themselves who aren't actually doing
(42:07) anything you can justify as being wrong outside of Christian ethics and so the
(42:12) thing is is that that seems to dispel the nap now can you Steelman that back to me I know so you're saying that if we
(42:20) own ourselves and everybody and and an act of aggression would be violating someone
(42:25) else's self- ownership then it wouldn't be an act of aggression to what kill
(42:31) yourself incest with amongst adults things like this right okay so I'm still
(42:37) so if that's so if that's true and the only moral ODS that we have for why you shouldn't do this is through
(42:42) Christianity no I didn't say no by the way I didn't say Christianity but you said but okay okay okay fine God
(42:48) whatever the Justified axom is for God for divine command okay sure if that's the only way that we can justify that
(42:54) this is immoral then the idea that you owning your self and two consenting adults owning themselves an anarcho
(43:01) capitalist land uh can't be true because you are willing to use and violate their
(43:08) self-ownership with aggression because you think they're doing something morally wrong but you can't justify what
(43:14) they're doing that's morally wrong no okay so again this is uh back what I was trying to say before that I think
(43:20) there's these two things that need to be separated so there's the moral application of the initiation of
(43:27) violence and then there's morality and they're not exactly the same thing and
(43:32) so if my neighbor let's just say my neighbor is not um being a good husband
(43:39) and being a good father okay so like like let's say he's just very cold with
(43:44) his children and um like doesn't pay the bills on time and doesn't work and is
(43:51) lazy and does all types of things that I judge to be morally wrong like I think he should be a better father and a
(43:58) better husband but if I go over there and beat him over the head with a club to make him be a better husband and
(44:04) father it's not as simple an equation as was he morally right or wrong the
(44:10) question is is it morally Justified for me to enact this Force against him in
(44:15) order to make like is that more moral or immoral than his initial sin so that's
(44:23) the question that you get into when you start talking about government regulating a lot of these things it's not as simple as you're making it out
(44:29) that well if people own themselves then it has to be morally Justified whatever they do okay so let's see if we can't uh
(44:37) parse this out and again I'll see if I can't just Steelman this with uh with my criticism so the thing is is that I
(44:44) agree we can look at Scales right we can say that we can we can get to absurd conclusions um if we if we were to say
(44:52) that there's no time or place to apply some sort of like aggress aggression
(44:57) towards somebody right um otherwise you would aggress on them for anything that you consider some kind of moral failure
(45:03) and obviously that's not what either of us are after sure what I'm saying is that if we take it to its logical
(45:09) conclusion libertarianism which is what I said in my opening as a consequence of itself has to actually lead to
(45:16) degeneracy and the reason is because of the idea here is that I own me and you
(45:22) own you and if we consent to the two things we do together and it hurts nobody else therefore not violating uh
(45:29) the non non-aggression principle which is the foundation for which this thing uh you know revolves then how can you
(45:36) make ever a claim against homosexuals getting married or against incest or
(45:42) against any of these things how can you possibly make that claim that's the that's the ultimate question okay so I a
(45:49) couple things here I don't think that's the ultimate question and I do think that I could make the
(45:55) claim against that in the same way that you could and I think we already established this right that we can both
(46:02) make the claim for the exact same reasons because we believe in God and we believe in Morality and we believe that
(46:08) this is immoral so we both have the exact same ability to make the claim but
(46:14) if we're talking about what your your more I think broader point that you made there that libertarianism leads to
(46:23) immorality I think is completely wrong and I think this is like kind of the most important um fundamental
(46:32) miscalculation that a lot of people on the right who reject libertarianism make the idea that well freedom and liberty
(46:40) is really what leads to degeneracy and that's just not true and in fact
(46:47) empirically and logically we can look at the situation particularly the situation
(46:52) of the United States of America and go look as the government has grown bigger and bigger you've seen degeneracy get
(47:01) more and more out of control and I I understand why there is a movement
(47:08) against degeneracy I understand we live in a moment right now where I think our
(47:14) society is essentially disintegrating and I think that that's one of the things that Andrew you kind of
(47:20) are I don't know prominent for pointing out the disintegration of values and
(47:27) Norms all through the reason I believe that those values and Norms are being eroded is because of Libertarians and
(47:36) social leftist Elites who often will move towards this principle of non-aggression they just do it in two
(47:42) different ways the way one which libertarian does it is by saying if I'm not violating you and your
(47:48) non-aggression principle in some way then you really have no claim to tell me to do anything and everything is
(47:53) affirmed through private property the Leti is just airm Ms at the opposite direction says there's no such thing as
(47:59) private property and but they they apply the same principle of if I'm not hurting anybody then what's the problem and so
(48:07) as we dive into what is the non-aggression principle the non-aggression principle is the
(48:12) principle that if you are not aggressing against somebody else and you own yourself they cannot aggress against you
(48:18) so via consent you cannot utilize the state Dave to have them go and break up
(48:24) an incest family uh who is all in with each other and having orgies nightly you
(48:29) can't do it I I I understand that's your your perspective on this but that has nothing to do with what I'm getting into
(48:35) so that actually what the non-aggression principle implies is that um at best
(48:42) government ought to be um severely restricted and at worst the government
(48:47) ought to not exist at all now as we've had the rise in government and I mean
(48:54) look in the United States of America just in the last 20 years in the last 20 plus
(49:01) years which we could go back a lot further than that you've had a tremendous growth in the size of
(49:07) government and what happens as the government gets bigger and bigger is
(49:13) that um all of the things that uh Christians and traditionalists tend to
(49:19) Value get undermined and so this institution of the government that is
(49:26) inherently based on violating the non-aggression principle does its absolute best to
(49:34) replace take over and monopolize all of the areas where traditionally family and
(49:42) Community had domain and so yeah but why would that be problematic if the non-aggression principle logically
(49:49) should be ignored for these moral ODS that's that is the question well hold on
(49:54) that's a separate question the point I'm making is that it's not an outgrowth of the non-aggression principle it's an
(50:01) outgrowth of a rejection of the non-aggression principle that's actually what leads to all of this so then if we
(50:07) were to have the non-aggression principle with a shrunken government are we still going to use the government in
(50:13) order to aggress against consenting adults who want to have incest or not as
(50:18) long as a government exists it will be used to aggress against non-consenting adults and yes I I don't know listen
(50:25) Andrew you're trying obsess over this incest argument okay laws laws against
(50:32) incest I'll grant you that sure fine can we move on to any other topic now we
(50:38) move on to talking about the state of the country as it actually exists yeah but this is the state of the country
(50:43) well hold on it's pretty funny because we literally we live under the most powerful centralized government in the
(50:49) history of the world the biggest organization in the history of the world is the United States of America's
(50:55) federal government in Washington DC spending over $6 trillion a year employing millions of people with the
(51:02) capability of overthrowing regimes all around the world and instead the argument we're getting here is but if
(51:07) there was no government who would stop an adult brother and sister from [ __ ]
(51:13) that's kind of goofy man it it doesn't really have anything to I just want to let you know that saying kind it's kind
(51:19) of goofy isn't an argument you just said if we scale the government down to its eenth point of scal down as long as
(51:25) there was still a government you would want them to enforce action via violating the non-aggression principle
(51:31) for your preference so if there was that's not what I said well it's an Dave
(51:36) it is it's an entailment if the government's really really really big and enforce it right now and then you
(51:42) say but if it was really really small we would still enforce that because you want to have those laws then regardless
(51:47) of the SI size of government the degeneracy is still going to exist right and it's still going to need to be
(51:52) enforced against regardless of the size of the government what I'm sorry just can you rephrase the
(51:59) question what is it exactly you're asking me I'm asking you in if we reach
(52:04) anarcho Utopia we scale the government down I'm not for a Utopia but okay but
(52:10) if we reach if we reach anarcho whatever you want as the ultimate right the government is now scaled down to the
(52:15) point where it's essentially gone right would you still want enforcement against
(52:21) this kind of thing and how could you have enforcement against it without a government what what what against what
(52:27) kind of thing like incest or gay marriage or any of these degenerate actions uh okay well there's I I think
(52:34) there's a pretty big gap between incest and gay marriage but I will say that um
(52:40) I think there's a gap between that what is it but I think they're two different things yeah they're two different things
(52:45) but they're the same as far as two consenting adults doing what they want right yeah me and you doing this debate
(52:52) are also two consenting adults doing what they want but there's a gap between those things so any anyway um what does
(52:57) that have to do I mean it logically tracks that if yeah dude you can't go on these long rambling diet tribes and I
(53:04) do seconds I do four seconds and you go you go berserk just calm down let me ask
(53:10) ask the actual question dude come on man I asked you to clarify your question and then I'm trying to and I'm trying to
(53:16) clarify it so that you understand it but don't act like I'm going on these long rounds and you're not talking I mean
(53:22) well you filibuster you don't say that much but I'm still willing to engage come on Andrew I'm super super concise
(53:29) so I'm super concise I'm going to get right to it right so that you understand what I'm saying to you what I'm asking
(53:34) you is that the enforcement mechanism against this degeneracy which you consider to be morally wrong absent
(53:40) estate are you still going to want an enforcement mechanism against these moral wrongs you say oh the there's a
(53:46) big difference between incest and and uh you know homosexual marriage or homosexual uh sex however the truth is
(53:54) is that both of these things are exactly logically similar when it comes to two consenting adults doing what it is that
(54:02) they want when they want to do it without hurting anybody else how's that
(54:07) not the case well again as I just pointed out we're also too consenting
(54:13) adults doing what we want without hurting anyone else but I think that's very different so I'm just saying that
(54:19) I'm not even saying I support either of those things I'm saying I see them as different no the truth is that if we
(54:26) didn't have what what we have today and and this is what happens with every very
(54:32) powerful centralized government is that their biggest enemy becomes the family
(54:37) the church the community because they don't like things that compete with them if we actually got rid of all of the
(54:44) impediments between that you would see a an enormous return to normaly in this
(54:51) country you would see I I mean look starting in even in the 1930s with Social Security when you had the
(54:58) government take over the role of we'll take care of old people when they get older what you used to have was what
(55:06) that parents would rely on their children to take care of them when they get older once you like remove all of
(55:12) the disincentives toward normaly and family and Community if the state was to
(55:17) be reduced to the size that you're talking about no my concern would not be
(55:23) do we have federal agents with guns going in to break up incest amongst
(55:31) adults anytime it's happening I don't even know how you would go about forcing that what about people who just want to
(55:38) transition again again the transitioning stuff is totally a status product this
(55:45) is something that's come out of the universities that are essentially government programs that has been um
(55:51) perpetuated by the corporate media and any of that allow to do no no well
(55:58) that's that's listen no okay okay hold on let me say this to be
(56:03) clear children absolutely not you should not be allowed to do that adults adults
(56:11) it you a a doctor should lose their license if they were ever to perform a
(56:17) surgery or something but it's voluntary sure also but a license could also be
(56:23) voluntary and a medical board could also be voluntary so what does that mean well so that's interesting uh that you bring
(56:30) that up considering that the AMA was just a large corporate entity that was not government regulated started off as
(56:37) a did it get government money though started off as a trade organization in fact and what it did was it defamed all
(56:44) other types of medicine and it that was not the government doing that that was a private institution which was doing that
(56:51) uh for the purpose for the purpose Carnegie right
(56:57) another private institution Carnegie so the thing is the thing is is that private institutions are just as uh
(57:04) susceptible to this type of overreach as the government is now as we hang on hang on let me finish my turn sure sure sure
(57:11) go ahead so as we dive into this though these medical licenses why would you even need to have a medical license in
(57:17) an anarcho capitalist system you wouldn't you wouldn't even need to have one and the voluntarism then of this man
(57:25) who wants to go in and this elective surgery done uh why would that be a problem there's no medical licenses Dave
(57:32) it's anarch it's anarcho capitalism baby okay so if you're GNA say that the worst
(57:38) case scenario in anarcho capitalism is that some random man could go in and
(57:43) someone would give him this like surgery okay fine I guess I think that the if
(57:48) you're asking why there would be licenses or why there would be voluntary organizations because that's what human
(57:55) beings always naturally uh uh gravitate toward but regardless of that none of
(58:00) that is really the problem the problem in our society is that this insane [ __ ]
(58:06) is being pushed on everyone and it's being pushed by giant corporations who
(58:11) are connected to the government it's being pushed by the government class and most importantly it's being pushed in
(58:17) the government schools you know one of the things also being pushed by private institutions and tanks who go to
(58:24) lobbyists and influence govern let me finish finish yeah all right okay so one
(58:30) of the things that I would say to uh to people listening to this because I hope you guys will like kind of try to
(58:36) internalize this a little bit look this whole [ __ ] all of this insane degeneracy
(58:43) is being pushed by the most powerful people in this country and it's not as
(58:49) if this just organically arose out of nowhere and I hope you guys would at least consider the possibility that look
(58:57) the government Always by its nature moves into the areas that were
(59:04) traditionally left for family and community and churches and even
(59:09) something like educating the kids this is one of the biggest problems that we have that the government is in control
(59:17) of it and why and and what would happen if they weren't it would fall back into
(59:22) the realm of families and communities and churches and what do you you think would be better what do you think would
(59:28) be better this being run by Washington DC or this being run by your local church that's kind of the point I'm
(59:34) making and if that if that means I have to sacrifice the FBI going on hunts for
(59:41) um you know people having incest I'm I'm willing to make yeah I mean these are great these are almost gr points except
(59:48) that you forget like these institutions like the AMA and this type of thing which started out you know 150 years ago
(59:55) uh that the government came in they used to come in with antitrust laws and break these things up and under anarcho
(1:00:01) America corporatism these antitrust laws would not exist these people would become you know anything let me finish
(1:00:08) Dave okay I apologize go ahead Andrew okay so anyway uh over and over again we
(1:00:14) see what happens when corporations also gain a huge leverage on power when it
(1:00:21) comes to no check on them from any government entity this was in fact the entire point of Franco Spain and why
(1:00:28) melini came up with the idea of fascism to begin with which was that the state
(1:00:33) needed to stop large trade organizations from swallowing up small trade organizations that was the point all
(1:00:39) right they and they re let me finish man sorry sorry recogniz they recognized
(1:00:44) that this was an important thing because what ends up happening is Corporate power can also become Elite and it
(1:00:50) becomes a government unto itself anarcho capitalism is not going to stop that from happening and on top of that that
(1:00:56) when we're talking about these moral ODS these moral claims there there's not going to be medical licenses there's no
(1:01:02) driver's licenses there's none of these things which would protect you from this degeneracy which your libertarian uh
(1:01:09) idealism leads us to every time you can't even tell us why any of these things are wrong to do Dave I I well
(1:01:15) okay I already told you and I have the exact same answer for what you have for why they're wrong but listen let me ask you this um have you because I know you
(1:01:23) call yourself a paleocon on Twitter are you like uh are you familiar with like
(1:01:28) the Paleo conservative thinkers like can is my favorite yeah okay by the way for
(1:01:35) anyone listening here read every Pat Buchanon book you can get your hands on they're the absolute best and um Paul
(1:01:41) godfried too you really should read him he's just so good and Sam Francis and all of these guys dude go read them and
(1:01:48) you will understand why this is just not right no it's not because Pat Buchanan would agree with me he would say that
(1:01:54) these these moral would he would say these moral ODS are going to require state enforcement no matter what that's
(1:01:59) why he was a Paleo con okay but what Pat Buchanan would not agree with you on is this idea that if there wasn't the
(1:02:07) government regulating these things there'd be no reason for anyone to have licenses or something like that that's
(1:02:12) just not true dude and license them listen all of these guys the Pat
(1:02:18) Buchanan uh Paul godf freed all of these guys Sam Francis they all said that a
(1:02:23) huge part of their program was a drastic cut in the size and scope of government
(1:02:29) because it didn't like the military industrial complex no no no no no no not just that yes Andrew believe me I'm I
(1:02:38) know this stuff so I'm not wrong about this yes they wanted to cut in the military-industrial complex but not just
(1:02:44) that they wanted to destroy the managerial state that was their entire plan Paul godfried said and and this was
(1:02:52) his uh uh view which I thought was a perfect way to say it which I think you should really consider that he goes I am
(1:03:00) strategically a radical libertarian and he was very clear that
(1:03:05) he's not a Libertarian Because he believes in rights in the same sense that I do like he was saying I don't
(1:03:12) believe in your right to live any degenerate lifestyle that you want to but I'm strategically a radical
(1:03:19) libertarian because he recognized that the only way that you could ever return
(1:03:24) to normal culturally speaking was to get DC out of
(1:03:30) the mix that the centralized federal government cannot be this in control of
(1:03:36) the way children are raised the way people are educated the way people get health care and education and housing
(1:03:43) without it totally perverting the national St and local governments are just as susceptible to these things Dave
(1:03:49) from lobbying and everything else and you can't stop you can't stop lobbying and you can't stop people who have the
(1:03:56) will of saying I own myself from demanding that they be able to be represented from demanding that they be
(1:04:03) able to have lobbying from demanding that they own themselves they're consenting that has nothing to do with
(1:04:09) self- ownership but okay but clear highly recommend listen I would highly recommend instead of you just trying to
(1:04:15) win this point against me go read what Paul godfried and Pap youon had to say about this because they great I don't
(1:04:22) understand why can't you make their argument Dave no no no I can make their argument I'm just saying I'm saying
(1:04:28) Andrew you're already in the mode of not trying to hear a point I have to say heard fire back fire back immediately to
(1:04:36) get the win yeah I'm I don't agree with you so I'm arguing with you that's how that works I'm say right okay I'm saying
(1:04:44) that these guys who you call yourself a Paleo conservative the people who were the leading thinkers of paleo
(1:04:51) conservatism made these points really well I'm just trying to say maybe go get it from a sour where you'll actually be
(1:04:56) able to listen to it from that's I'm listening to it from you right now I'm arguing with your points because I don't
(1:05:03) agree with your points and when we get to these ought claims of what we ought to do it it seems like you're talking
(1:05:09) out of both sides of your mouth you're like oh I think doctors should have their medical licenses revoked for doing
(1:05:15) this bad thing but if we if we really looking at what self- ownership would be in anarcho capitalist land there
(1:05:21) wouldn't be these licenses to begin with I don't really understand why it is of licenses from who who would they be
(1:05:27) issued by uh organizations the same as they are now what do you mean and that so the organization which issued the
(1:05:34) license would have some sort of authority and would be able to use Force right no not necessarily but they would
(1:05:39) be able to use their own version of like someone could be banned from their organization are you actually making the
(1:05:46) kind of like bosot like uh thing where you can't separate government from society and that there can't be anything
(1:05:53) other than like there I mean look obviously all of the government involvement aside but we all know that
(1:05:59) we were told a couple things not to say before we got on this show right because of the YouTube government there's lots
(1:06:05) of different why would you have a problem with YouTube that's a private organization doing what it wants
(1:06:11) Dave what are you asking me now why would you have a problem with YouTube there's a private organization doing
(1:06:16) what it wants you guys by the way can you guys see this is what's frustrating to me if you could see I just made a
(1:06:21) point it was an excellent point and then you immediately just pivot to else and move the goal post so anyway
(1:06:28) the the point I was making was that there can be private organizations that
(1:06:33) can have their standards also and then you pivoted to saying do I support YouTube and what they do in what context
(1:06:40) what do you mean no what I what you said was we we had some to or things which would be TOS that we couldn't talk about
(1:06:46) on this private platform but you must support private platforms existing because you're an anarcho capitalist
(1:06:53) what's the problem so you don't support priv platforms existing do listen man do
(1:06:58) you support private restaurants existing sure okay if they brought you uh you
(1:07:03) ordered a T-bone steak and they brought it to you and it was freezing cold would you support that because you support
(1:07:09) private restaurants existing no exactly what does AF do with anything it proves
(1:07:15) exactly you believe that the restaurant should have the right wait wait da support something existing doesn't weird
(1:07:23) so you don't believe that restaurants should have the right to serve you a cold stay no I do well then what are you
(1:07:29) talking about Dave did you honestly not get that if I I no I didn't honestly get
(1:07:35) that no it made no sense all right all right listen listen point to you dude
(1:07:41) what Dave is saying is I don't support you doing that but what Andrew is saying
(1:07:46) but do you support the right of a private organization to make their own choices to which I believe Dave's answer is yeah they could make that choice but
(1:07:53) I personally don't like that choice I'm not in support of that choice but I think Andrew the point he's making is
(1:07:59) yeah but if you had an anarcho capitalist Society these bad organizations would exist and they would
(1:08:04) do bad things you would have to say they're allowed to do it l well okay fine if you want to say oh if we had an
(1:08:10) anarcho capitalist Society this thing in my head would happen and it could be
(1:08:15) really bad whatever I'm not going to sit here and even argue about that stuff okay fine I'm talking about how about in
(1:08:21) the real world we live under the biggest government in the history of the world and look what it's led to let's talk
(1:08:27) about the world we actually live in MH okay let's talk about the world that we actually live in it's my belief that the
(1:08:34) leftist Paradigm which is a Libertarian Paradigm of the non-aggression principle
(1:08:39) is how leftists are able to control inside of this ginormous government apparatus which they're continuously
(1:08:45) expanding I think that they utilize victim classes like lgbtq and others and
(1:08:50) say if they're not hurting anybody then what's the problem Libertarians have no way to counter act this because they
(1:08:56) can't justify why it would be a problem either so what they end up doing is saying well we can't really say [ __ ] can
(1:09:02) we we can't really tell you that we that gays can't be married we can't really tell you not to expand victim classes we
(1:09:08) can't really tell you any of these things because ultimately you believe in the same principle that they do which is do
(1:09:14) whatever the [ __ ] you want as long as you're not hurting anybody man the good is the good man what smoke the dop man
(1:09:21) all of this is uh that that's just completely ridiculous I think that uh that
(1:09:26) libertarianism um if you follow it to its logical conclusion would tell you
(1:09:31) that the Civil Rights Act was not justified would tell you that Government funding all of these universities is not
(1:09:37) justified would tell you that all of this stuff like I I mean it would tear down the entire thing wait wait it would
(1:09:44) it would tell you slavery wasn't or or abolishing slavery wasn't Justified what would it tell you that
(1:09:51) abolishing slavery was to do with what I just said because that was an act of government right wait hold on but what
(1:09:56) does that have to do with what I just said because when you're talking about civil rights we're still going back to self-ownership the Civil Rights Act has
(1:10:03) nothing to do with slavery dude no but it has to do with self-ownership and pre- Civil Rights Act there were slaves
(1:10:09) right no yeah there wasn't when did you think the Civil Rights Act happened the Civil Rights H act happened during the
(1:10:16) Jim Crow era but what I'm talking about was slavery specifically is did they have 100 years before the Civil Rights
(1:10:23) Act yes did they anyway yes slave slaves had a right to not be slaves but anyway
(1:10:29) the the point that I'm I'm making is that then we have extension logical extensions here then Dave that we have
(1:10:36) to contend with okay Dave finish all right Andrew whatever dude all right listen the point that I'm making is to
(1:10:42) just say that what's happening in a college campus which is essentially a government program I mean all all of
(1:10:49) these colleges whether they're like State schools or whether they just had all of their loans you know guaranteed
(1:10:55) by the federal government or directly given out by the federal government it's a big giant government program and the
(1:11:01) idea that they would ever sustain themselves in a market is ridiculous and the fact that there are young people in
(1:11:07) those groups now want to identify as not the gender that they were born in has
(1:11:13) nothing to do with the non-aggression principle or self- ownership or anything about libertar not to with philosophy on
(1:11:20) government it does it does that's [ __ ] all doesn't all yeah not only that but I've been demonstrating it over
(1:11:26) and over and you have no defense from it if you own yourself why can't you choose your gender why can't you get your
(1:11:32) appendages cut off why can't you do these things Dave why shouldn't you be able to wait if you don't own your
(1:11:38) listen this is the thing I think you're not understanding Andrew I don't even get what you're saying here if you don't
(1:11:43) own yourself which I don't think you do right okay why shouldn't you be able to
(1:11:48) get your is it because there is no actual self ownership so okay hey I'm saying if
(1:11:56) you're right non Seer Dave it makes no sense oh my God what's a non seor
(1:12:02) Andrew non but if you don't own yourself you can do those things too it has nothing to do with whether you do or Not
(1:12:08) Right But you said what if you do own yourself and I'm saying but what if you don't so that's the
(1:12:13) point it's that's the non seor if I may I think that there's two ships passing
(1:12:19) here I think that the an the argument that Dave is making is this if we decrease the size of the federal
(1:12:25) government and the government in general as if he's suggesting culturally there wouldn't be the sort of brainwashing
(1:12:31) that's going on through those organizations that make these things a problem Andrew's saying though he's saying but the principle of if you own
(1:12:39) yourself you could do whatever you want is foundational to a lot of these egregious behaviors that we would see
(1:12:45) and so even if we Shrunk the size of government if we did so based on the mentality of well you could do whatever
(1:12:50) you want as long as it's agreed upon by consenting adults we would see a lot of behavior that he finds to be undesirable
(1:12:56) or grotesque or sins such as incest homosexual relationship Etc oh all right
(1:13:02) let me ask you this so the I I think we could probably all agree that between
(1:13:09) let's just say in the last hundred years okay the size and scope of government in
(1:13:14) this country has grown enormously obviously uh if you are familiar with the Paleo conservatives they were you
(1:13:20) know hearkening back to the old conservatives who fought the New Deal back in the 19 1930s and I could go back
(1:13:26) a little bit further than that to woodro Wilson creating the the central bank and
(1:13:32) the income tax but you have the New Deal you have the expansions of government in
(1:13:37) World War II the expansions post World War II with the creation of the CIA and
(1:13:43) all of that stuff the National Security apparatus the global Empire um you have the Great Society in the 1960s you have
(1:13:51) you know um I don't know fast forward to George W bush creating the Department of Homeland
(1:13:57) Security and the war on terrorism and Barack Obama and and all this stuff do
(1:14:03) we have more degeneracy now or then does it seem like the growth of government
(1:14:09) has but that's that's a correlate if I could point to you where there's I'm just asking but I'm asking there any
(1:14:14) correlation or any causation in there there's some there's some correlation and I'll grant that there's some correlation but I can also point to
(1:14:20) large government apparatuses where the state is entirely in control where there's no degeneracy because you just
(1:14:27) face the wall in those governments right so the thing is is that just correlating that because government has grown in
(1:14:33) size and and degeneracy has also grown in size it's not a good argument because I can point to complete authoritarian
(1:14:40) regimes where there's none of that at all and the government's totally in charge so the thing is is that what
(1:14:45) regimes are you thinking of I I would guess that like places like North Korea right if you uh engage in degenerate
(1:14:53) actions X ex bad thing happens to you I would assume so I'm just saying that the corate itself is not enough to say that
(1:15:00) that is the cause I think that ngos are also a huge cause of these things even NOS which start absent any type of
(1:15:07) government movement at all or massive think tanks which are privately funded and oftentimes you see what'll happen
(1:15:14) with like the lgbtq community and things like this they create their own independent than tanks and NOS which
(1:15:21) then begin a mass lobbying campaign against morality and once you have a lob lobbying campaign against morality
(1:15:28) there's no real good reason why you should reduce government because you can't make good a claims for why you
(1:15:34) should just like why should why should we do any of this stuff what happens with these uh lgbtq think tanks
(1:15:41) especially they'll even go into Christian churches things like this they offer them bags of money to re-evaluate
(1:15:47) the messaging inside of these churches these are these are uh apparatuses which then go and bribe the government and
(1:15:54) these are private institutions they all start as private institutions the government's not commissioning but then
(1:15:59) but then they go and bribe the government yeah but the government but but here's the thing but here but here's
(1:16:06) the thing I think that private institutions will always either form a government or make moves to subvert a
(1:16:12) government because it's in their best interest to monopolize Force it's in their best interest to do it just like
(1:16:17) it's in our best interest as Christians to monopolize the force apparatus of the state as well if you want to scale back
(1:16:24) aspects of the State [ __ ] great I want to scale back aspects of the state too that
(1:16:30) really as what aspects do you want to scale back oh I'd like to scale back uh
(1:16:35) especially social spending when it comes to social safety nets I'd like to scale back a lot why would you want to I'm I'm
(1:16:41) just curious I I don't mean to interrupt you but so why do you want to scale back social uh aspects of the
(1:16:47) State uh because I think that many of those social aspects are violations of
(1:16:53) ethical concerns so anth IAL concern of robbing Peter to pay Paul uh various
(1:16:58) things like this I think that those are unethical those are ethics concerns okay and why why is that unethical it's
(1:17:06) unethical because I follow Christian ethics and under this particular ethical framework we would say that this type of
(1:17:12) theft would be incorrect and that the state state apparatus it's not really their concern to move into that that
(1:17:18) would be charitable organizations which would move into doing distrib that way I'm I'm so curious about this so I just
(1:17:24) have to because you kind of like grilled me before about what my ethics are so so
(1:17:29) what is it so the same ethics so I don't know what arum rob peter I'm not making an
(1:17:35) argument I'm asking a question so robbing Peter to pay Paul why is that unethical what are you what do you mean
(1:17:41) by that well I'm I'm saying that if you have centralized relocation from the successful to the non-successful the
(1:17:48) reason that this becomes an ethical concern is because you're engaging in Theft obvious theft
(1:17:56) okay but isn't that always what government does by its nature no is robbing Peter to pay Paul no I don't
(1:18:02) think that taxation's necessarily theft in many circumstances I think it can be theft what makes it theft in your
(1:18:09) description but not in others in the in which description so
(1:18:14) you just said it's obviously theft to rob Peter to pay Paul so what made that theft and what makes it not theft in
(1:18:21) other situations well I don't I maybe I'm understanding the question correctly you
(1:18:26) example you no you just said in your example that this was robbing Peter to
(1:18:32) pay Paul and it's theft so what makes it theft in that situation but not theft in
(1:18:37) other situations like what other situation are you talking about I just need a comparison real quick so I
(1:18:43) understand what you're asking what makes it in any other situation that government takes money from people not theft but in the one you just labeled
(1:18:50) theft you mean oh okay I see what you're saying so you're saying why is it theft
(1:18:55) to um take a bunch of money out of a rich guy's account and give it to a guy you know who's just poor because you
(1:19:02) want to versus some some other unique situation like um infrastructure
(1:19:07) spending or things like this said what you just said Andrew stop buying time man I'm just curious I'm not trying to buy time I just want to get it clarified
(1:19:15) I just want it clarified I don't think that infrastructure spending is theft I don't think that taxation property
(1:19:22) taxation even is theft I don't think those things are theft I think that a direct taking of your account for the
(1:19:29) purposes of giving it to a social group based on immutable characteristics is theft that would be theft I'm I'm just
(1:19:35) curious what makes that theft uh that you're taking a thing
(1:19:40) which does not belong to you and creating a distribution of the thing which doesn't belong to you but so why
(1:19:46) wouldn't that be true for property taxes because you don't actually uh own
(1:19:51) the property right so but but in your you just said if you're they're taking
(1:19:57) something that doesn't belong to you so do you actually own that property no that's is why I'm saying that the
(1:20:02) construction the the the construction of of ownership is just that a construction
(1:20:09) so property is on Andrew I think I have you in something here and I think you know I do why was it I just want to make
(1:20:16) sure I'm clarifying why was it why was it theft in your example why did you own it in your example but not in mine
(1:20:23) because I don't really understand your example that's why I'm trying to get it clarified it wasn't mine it was yours I'm saying example of of scaling back of
(1:20:31) scaling back to rob Peter to pay Paul I would say that that is theft however the
(1:20:36) taxation for property I would not say it is because when you're robbing Peter to pay because it's bed why is it theft
(1:20:42) yeah because it's based around the construction which we have for theft or non- theft for property that's the point
(1:20:49) if I may if I could try to clarify I'm not trying to make anyone's argument yeah yeah just clarify what he's what
(1:20:54) talk this is what's going on Dave saying like look if under your theory all
(1:21:00) taxation would be theft because it's taking away from a person and giving to someone else you seem to be saying it's
(1:21:06) not theft if it's giving to sort of a public good so like property tax to pay
(1:21:12) for roads that's not theft but property tax presumably you would say this property tax to pay for welfare for
(1:21:19) single mothers that would be theft or to pay for LGBT issues or something like that so he's saying why isn't the
(1:21:25) property tax always theft and you seem to be saying it's only theft if that money is given to particular entities
(1:21:32) he's asking why that's the case oh based on immutable versus non- immutable so uh
(1:21:37) if if you are um utilizing infrastructure and things like this and
(1:21:42) you're paying for that infrastructure you have local levies which are gone through and voted on for that
(1:21:48) infrastructure that can't be theft because essentially the majority of your population is volunteering
(1:21:55) to move that money into the government coffers for that purpose whereas you're not there is no such thing as
(1:22:01) voluntarism when it comes to the government levying your account that's not voluntary and it never has been am I
(1:22:08) however you have what's called I'm gonna explain you have what's called duties right duties duties can Trump theft for
(1:22:16) instance you could say if you own yourself and the government conscripts you that they're stealing
(1:22:22) you are they stealing you Dave I'm sorry am are they stealing if
(1:22:29) the government conscripts you you have a duty to go a duty to go defend your Homeland if
(1:22:36) you are conscripted for war is the government stealing you they're enslaving you sure there it's
(1:22:43) enslavement to be conscripted in a draft to defend your Homeland well look you
(1:22:49) see see to defend your Homeland How about if they uh script you to go over to Ukraine
(1:22:56) and fight the Russians is that enslaving you yeah I'm not sure that it is because I think you do have duties so if you so
(1:23:03) if your government led by Joe Biden decides that you're uh now conscripted
(1:23:10) and you will be on a plane over to Ukraine to fight on the front lines they haven't enslaved you no I don't think so
(1:23:16) I think you have duties still in society don't you think you have duties to be conscripted like if you were attacked no
(1:23:22) I think we have lots of Duties but I think if Joe tells you to go die on the FR might be a to make good moral you
(1:23:28) might be able to make good moraled resist that Dave you might be able to make good moral objections to
(1:23:34) this type of draft and the duty itself that's fine however if your homeland's attacked and you're conscripted that's
(1:23:41) okay right but how is that not enslavement then yeah I mean I'm not
(1:23:46) saying it is maybe it's not or it is it's enslavement to be drafted to
(1:23:51) protect the Homeland if it's attacked by a foreign enemy G yes essentially yes it is yes
(1:23:58) okay so no duty at all no duties here's the thing is that it's funny because you start laughing but then like you can't
(1:24:06) when I say if you were grabbed gun put to your head and dragged out to the
(1:24:12) Ukrainian front lines and forced to fight on the Ukrainian front lines you can't say yes that is me being enslaved
(1:24:19) I think you can make moral objections hold on let me hold on then you turn it to what if like PE people are you know
(1:24:27) invading our country okay so I'll say this if people were invading our country
(1:24:34) and people like a foreign army is coming up through my neighborhood I think you sure could make a moral argument that I
(1:24:41) have a responsibility to go to those front line right this is the point when we're talking about the draft we're not
(1:24:47) talking let me finish this so I I think you could make an argument that I have a moral responsibility to go to the front
(1:24:54) lines and start fighting to make sure my family is okay what if you don't have a family leave huh say what if you don't
(1:25:01) what if you don't have a family it's just you okay but I'm talking about me and I do so anyway let me finish but what if you didn't you have a moral
(1:25:07) obligation then great so let me just finish so uh but if I say make the
(1:25:14) Judgment that I go you know what there's too many of them we got to retreat and we got to try to surround them and come
(1:25:20) back and someone puts a gun at my face and goes no you have to go to the the front line right now then yeah in
(1:25:26) essence they have enslaved me so so so then you're making my point again so that you understand yeah I'll explain
(1:25:33) how when you're talking about duties you asked me you said would it be a duty so I'm talking about what is a current Duty
(1:25:38) so I'm saying yeah currently that would be your duty but the moral objections which you could make would be abound a
(1:25:44) just you could say it's an unjust War so therefore doesn't fall under my duties you are making the exact same claim this
(1:25:50) is an unjust War it doesn't fall under my duties right so if I'm scripted though for a just War like an invasion
(1:25:56) then it does fall under Duty so then it's not enslavement right however in both situations it still would be
(1:26:03) enslavement by your by your ideology you don't really have duty here that's not really no that's not really the
(1:26:10) distinction the distinction is whether voluntarism verse Force so no I'm not
(1:26:16) saying that like if there could be a just War where someone still flees and
(1:26:22) abandons the war but that doesn't mean that if they were for look even whether you whether you think whether you think
(1:26:30) it's Justified or not it would still be enslaving someone to force them to be a
(1:26:36) soldier in that war want to be a part of so if you're conscripted and your
(1:26:41) Homeland is under attack you have no greater duty to defend your Homeland it
(1:26:47) depends on the situation man look there were lots of people in Ukraine who uh
(1:26:52) who fled and I I don't know that they were wrong they I I don't know listen a
(1:26:58) situation like the war on Ukraine the United States of America and NATO provoked Russia for decades literally
(1:27:06) just poked this [ __ ] bear D this is on a tangent that has nothing no no no no it has total bearing
(1:27:13) give me two seconds and you'll understand what I'm saying they poked this bear over and over again until
(1:27:20) Russia invaded and then when Russia invaded and Ukraine was about to get
(1:27:26) [ __ ] up look I understand where there'd be people in Ukraine who wanted to jump on
(1:27:32) the front lines and fight again but I also understand where there'd be people who go listen I got to try to get my
(1:27:37) family out and get the hell out of here so it's not so black and white as to like whether like there's this situation
(1:27:45) where someone invades your country and it's just Justified to fight back against them I I I I think maybe if
(1:27:52) you're listening about conscription though so I do and I'll steal man I'll steal man hang on I'll Ste man the point
(1:27:59) yeah I'll me Ste man the point last point on this then we're make the closing statements because we have a lot
(1:28:04) of super chats and questions from the audience so yeah yeah so let me just steal man your point your point is look
(1:28:09) this isn't so black and white there could be situations where I could see conscription as being a duty I could see it as not being a duty I'm not arguing
(1:28:16) that I just want a concession that at least sometimes it must be and if at least sometimes it must be a duty then
(1:28:22) you do have greater Duty I than just owning you just owning you can't be enough there must be additional duties
(1:28:29) on top of that like conscription well look if you're saying just owning me
(1:28:34) again it I have a ton of Duties on top of just owning me I have a duty a an
(1:28:43) obligation to protect my wife my kids to provide for them to give them a great
(1:28:49) life if you own yourself why do you have such a duty again from he said at the
(1:28:54) very beginning it has nothing to do with owning myself I do own myself and why do
(1:28:59) I have such a duty because I believe in God and God wants me to be a great
(1:29:05) father and a great husband so so God owns you okay okay listen there's never
(1:29:10) good place to end I I know that it sucks we can keep going on with this what we're gonna do is do closing statements
(1:29:16) SE up to seven minutes a piece uh we will start with Dave you could say whatever you want Andrew don't interrupt
(1:29:23) and then Andrew can say what ever he wants so you could summarize the debate you get any positions that you wanted to
(1:29:28) clarify whatever you like for seven minutes then we'll get to some audience questions so go ahead Dave floor is yours all right well look let me just
(1:29:35) say before we uh go to these questions I will say I have the feeling that um Andrew annoyed me a bit in this debate
(1:29:42) but I have a feeling I would really like the guy if we uh if we just hung out and I actually uh have enjoyed some of the
(1:29:48) back and forths that we've had on this so I I would just say that I think there's been some
(1:29:55) points that are made here that I don't think accurately reflect the position
(1:30:00) that I'm taking and perhaps I've been unfair in some of the positions Andrew is taking so if I let's just say I own a
(1:30:07) book like let's say I don't know one of these books right here okay here I got a
(1:30:12) book okay I own this book now it's a really good book to me now let's say I
(1:30:18) get that book now I've read it I've actually read it twice but let's just say I bought that book and I own it and
(1:30:25) I instead of reading it I burned it and you were to say wait a minute Dave do you own that book if you own it it would
(1:30:33) be wrong for you to burn it rather than read it the point is that yes I probably
(1:30:41) agree with you it would be a better thing for me to do to read that book than to burn it that has nothing to do
(1:30:46) with whether I own it or whether it would be right for someone else to come by force and take it away from me I
(1:30:52) think that's kind of like the that's been uh we've been talking past each other a little bit I think that some of
(1:31:00) these outlandish examples about well if you really believe in self- ownership
(1:31:06) then you can have no moral qualms about what anyone does with their self- ownership just isn't acccurate and I
(1:31:12) think that in the world we're living in and this is something again that the
(1:31:17) Paleo conservatives their best thinkers please anybody listening go read P
(1:31:23) Buchanan godfried or Sam Francis or any of these guys one of the things that they
(1:31:29) understood was that part of the reason why American society has degenerated so
(1:31:34) much part of the reason why we've had such a Divergence from normaly in our culture is because the government has
(1:31:42) gotten more and more powerful and if you want to have more power in the hands of
(1:31:47) communities and churches and parents and families you want to reduce the size and
(1:31:53) scope of government so that's what I would say and uh whatever Andrew wants to to finish with before we go into
(1:31:59) questions okay sounds good Andrew you got up to seven minutes go ahead you would like me I'm a real fun guy to be
(1:32:06) I'm just a fun guy Dave okay so the
(1:32:11) thing is is um I did enjoy the debate uh just so you know I don't take any of this kind of stuff personally I think
(1:32:18) that this type of discourse as brutal as it can be um and as entertaining as I think it is for people because it's so
(1:32:25) brutal uh I don't feel like you're a guy who holds personal grudges and it seems
(1:32:30) like you kind of enjoy uh as much as you might not have uh enjoyed some aspects
(1:32:36) of it I think that you probably enjoy the back and forth as much as I do uh ultimately though you have to
(1:32:41) re-evaluate some things here I think ultimately and I'm still going to bring you around to my way of thinking and
(1:32:46) perhaps next time we won't do a debate but we'll just do a good good oldfashioned convo um the first thing is is that
(1:32:54) you kind of pretend and are pretending to the audience that these are extreme examples of things which I bring up but
(1:33:01) they're not these are things which are happening right now we have incest laws right now we have laws against
(1:33:07) lgbtq uh or for lgbtq right now these are social issues of our time
(1:33:13) transitioning social issue of our time these things are not things which are in a far away far off land uh in a far away
(1:33:21) Future these are right now right here right in our face and we're discussing them as though they're right in our face
(1:33:27) because they are and so when we get to the moral a portion of this you realized I think early on that you can't really
(1:33:34) justify self- ownership as anything other than a construction and that your morality comes from God it's why I was
(1:33:40) willing to just kind of Grant all the absurdity and say sure it just comes it's just God talking in my mind Dave
(1:33:45) says me too it's like great well then we agree it's all Divine command there's no ownership it's just a social construct
(1:33:50) perfect now we know where we can go with our moral a claims how we get to where it is that we're going unfortunately for
(1:33:58) these ODS we're going to need enforcement there's no way around it and that's going to require some type of enforcement apparatus now maybe it
(1:34:05) didn't doesn't have to be the state fine but I didn't hear anything absent the state I never actually heard Dave say a
(1:34:12) word about why people can't engage in these if they own themselves unfortunately he never really gave us
(1:34:19) any good reasons for why if you do own yourself why you can't engage in these absurd activities other than he just
(1:34:25) really doesn't like them other than to appeal to what I would which is divine command and if that's the case you don't
(1:34:31) own yourself and the non-aggression principle no longer makes sense he never
(1:34:36) could justify that ever and that was kind of the core at the heart of this debate when we get into duties he says I
(1:34:43) do have some duties and obligations but when I ask him where they come from it's not it it's from God again it's divine
(1:34:50) command which gives him these duties and obligation not Liberty arianism libertarianism as a COR isn't doing
(1:34:56) anything to advance what could be a duty inside of society it's just unfettered rights with and all a right is is a
(1:35:04) privilege absent a duty when we get into whether or not can a person be
(1:35:10) conscripted sometimes maybe don't know kind of possibly it just you know it's
(1:35:15) cont context matters it's like okay yeah context matters but at the core can they without them being slaves I think that
(1:35:21) Dave kind of understands yeah there's a Time a place where that where there's a greater Duty that we have to appeal to
(1:35:27) overall because it was combative and we are coming at it from really different worldviews I don't think we got to the
(1:35:33) heart of everything that either of us would have liked to have gotten to the heart of but I did enjoy the spirited
(1:35:41) debate and uh again no uh no grudges at all Mr Smith and in the future I'll just
(1:35:46) come on your show and and we'll have a good convo or something like that but I do I do hope you did enjoy yourself at
(1:35:53) the very least so I did enjoy myself Andrew and thank you very much I don't agree with your uh synopsis of my
(1:36:00) opinion but I I I'm definitely down to do another podcast together well cheers to you sir cheers brother I had fun I
(1:36:07) love oh we can drink are they nationalists are we we're gonna make that legal all right good yes
(1:36:14) good I insist I enjoyed I thought it was great
(1:36:20) I would love to talk to both I was writing down things if I was debating either of you I would have said to both you but we don't have time for that
(1:36:26) tonight so here's what I'm going to do we are going to go through half of the super chats uh there's a lot so audience
(1:36:31) I ask you to please bear with me and because we have a lot of people that are on the call as well so we have about an
(1:36:37) hour and 15 minutes left so the first thing I want to say is thank you to anyone who subscribed or that donated
(1:36:44) subscriptions to people and memberships we really do appreciate it it means a lot we're g to try and as a quick
(1:36:50) intermission I'm sorry to cut in Dave while while you're at maximum audience can you shout your channel out to tell
(1:36:55) everybody where they can find you they follow you uh comic davesmith.com is my
(1:37:01) website and comic Dave Smith on Twitter and I'm part of the problem on YouTube and all over the place but yeah thank
(1:37:07) you okay well I just want to let you know that I had worked on this great rhetorical flourish that I was ready to use tonight that I couldn't deploy so
(1:37:14) I'm just going to tell you what it was it was it was going to be okay so it was supposed to be this um this idea that
(1:37:22) you know it came up where uh you would say something like uh you know well I'm I'm a comedian you know what I mean I'm
(1:37:27) not going to know the you know the the great ins and outs of these moral ODS and then I was going to respond with oh yeah well I'm an Entertainer and I'm
(1:37:33) super entertaining so tell me a joke funny man and that you know it would have been rhetorically effective Dave
(1:37:39) but I never got to employ it so I'm I'm pretty upset about that I'm not gonna lie I'm pretty upset about that all
(1:37:45) right well listen you it was a good plan it was a good plan it was it was a good plan it just it just never
(1:37:51) happened so um I going to not read each subscription donator but we do
(1:37:57) appreciate it but I hope the audience will understand just that 20 and up on the supers bro 20 up all right so here
(1:38:03) we go you sure just 20 up all right that's fine so we got from Daniel Morgan
(1:38:09) Dave what objective standard do you ground moral laws such as the non-agression principle or anything for
(1:38:15) that matter and I know you believe in God but if that's just general theism by what standard do you ground any
(1:38:21) objective morality I mean it's a good question I think that
(1:38:27) um I I don't know that me or Andrew had a a better answer for that then I I I
(1:38:33) always thought before I was a believer in God that it was kind of a silly
(1:38:38) argument that theists made when they said you can't have morality without a
(1:38:44) divine power and the more since I've found God I've agreed that yeah you
(1:38:49) probably can't like there really is no other there really is no other way to get to morality without a belief in a
(1:38:58) Creator and since I've believed in a Creator and I don't think that's not
(1:39:04) even really the right way to say it since I had my first kid I've just kind of known like I just kind of since i'
(1:39:11) I've been aware that there is a God it's been just more obvious that most of the
(1:39:18) things that are just deep rooted in us as inherently wrong or right
(1:39:23) come from that and so I don't know I don't know if I have much of a better like moral Foundation than that than to
(1:39:30) just go that all of us deep in our core know there are certain things that are wrong and certain things that are right
(1:39:36) we're gonna get you over on the duck side it's happening I don't think so but I do I do agree with that I mean I do
(1:39:43) think that's the I think that's the center of all of that Cal Chopper Outdoors for 1999 says one time for the
(1:39:50) stepdads now technically Andrew said I shouldn't have read that because it was only 20 and up I figure we' give him CL enough we'll give the penny give the
(1:39:57) penny all right I've known some good step outs by the way do you Andrew do you have a
(1:40:02) better answer for that than for me of like what's right and wrong like was that is there anything better than
(1:40:07) thattari usually Libertarians will use argumentation ethics which I know you're big that's a different that's a
(1:40:14) different thing I I love argumentation ethics but I'm saying that's a different question it is it is actually a decent
(1:40:20) way to create justifications around moral ODS argumentation ethics it
(1:40:25) actually is I agree but I think I think that I think that ultimately um yeah you can't you can't
(1:40:32) really make I mean Zulu does this all the time he seems to be pretty good at this a guy named liquid Zulu at creating
(1:40:37) uh justifications out of argumentation ethics so uh I've enjoyed watching those debates but I don't think that you can
(1:40:43) create good objective Justified morality absent Divine command I don't I don't think you can no unconventional man says
(1:40:52) the argument is so good it got Dave saying to himself [ __ ] I think
(1:40:58) it's for 50 bucks and then he throws another 50 down wow this guy he must
(1:41:03) have been one of those guys that got one of those jobs Biden was talking about today unconventional man for another 50 says slavery has been illegal for Years
(1:41:10) yet he is an here is Andrew owning Dave she [ __ ] oh you son of a [ __ ] I I
(1:41:17) thought you could I thought you could have got in with the [ __ ] there you know like we set you up on the first one and you didn't even you didn't even get on
(1:41:23) the second one pretty disappointing Dave I'm sure Dave will agree with this regardless who you think won the debate
(1:41:29) this guy for $50 Sean says Dave is getting frustrated LOL I did all I did
(1:41:34) at one point that's fair okay you can be frustrated I get frustrated in debate sometimes too and what we'll do is if we
(1:41:40) have time after the callers we'll go back to Super chats that weren't worth 20 but we just we only have limited time
(1:41:46) uh so we're trying to get through what we can blackest Panther for $20 says Andrew thought he was debating an
(1:41:51) intelligent person and came in guns of Blaze you overestimated Dave's grasp of debate or logic taking a debate stance
(1:41:56) doesn't mean you agree with the stance it's a debate of ideas and not morals anyone want to
(1:42:03) respond just more [ __ ] talking than a question I think well I think um I think that the two are inexplicably
(1:42:09) intertwined okay let's go with righteous muffin for $20 says Andrew you and Dave
(1:42:14) were in the same place he wants libertarian is some ran his way you want Christian ethics ran your way there are
(1:42:20) different sects of Christianity why is yours the correct one so because I can create philosophical
(1:42:25) justifications for my own and my own is the original Church of Christ by the way
(1:42:31) that's why would you agree though that perhaps the people that would come into
(1:42:37) power would not share your interpretation of course it's a possibility which is why I advocate that
(1:42:42) Christians should be trying to seize power I think it's a good idea Dave actually Advocates the same thing for
(1:42:47) Libertarians he recognized the same flaw in his own party which is wait we can't be so idealistic we forget that we have
(1:42:53) to actually have power for our idealism right like there's no way around that sure yeah yeah all right I mean
(1:43:01) just the way it is yeah I agree with that now I don't know what this MX no no no skip it we don't we don't take pesos
(1:43:08) here sir I'm a rural boy I don't know that
(1:43:15) [ __ ] only dollars here all right Nix says for $20 was just thinking a few
(1:43:20) days ago that this is a discussion I would love to see and hear here it is huzzah agree I thought it was really good
(1:43:26) huzzah um let's see a couple more John the wise tushy for $50 says
(1:43:34) libertarian morality Chase Oliver a I assume gay man for president please run
(1:43:41) from the libertarian party Dave any thoughts on I know youve I've seen some of your thoughts on Twitter but anything
(1:43:46) to say about Chase Oliver and what that says about dud you got to be better than that guy that guy sucks dude yeah
(1:43:53) no I mean I'm not uh I'm not going to defend that but what do you know just do
(1:43:59) it R Republicans got to be better than Donald Trump and uh you know picking
(1:44:04) Nikki Haley who he just guaranteed would be in his cabinet and you know I don't I
(1:44:10) don't know yeah it it sucks it sucks to be a part of a thing and hope someone who's going to represent it will
(1:44:16) represent it the right way and not get that so you know answer but are you gon to vote for Trump uh have you decided or
(1:44:23) is it something you don't want I don't um honestly I'm not a big believer in voting but voting especially voting for
(1:44:30) president um but I uh you know the idea of me doing something where it takes I
(1:44:38) don't know a couple of hours for you to have a one in 150 millionth say in it I
(1:44:45) don't know I do way more important [ __ ] than that I don't spend two hours on something that unimportant so I it
(1:44:52) doesn't matter that much to me but yes I uh I don't know that's that's I'm not
(1:44:59) going to vote for Chase that's for sure Zen's forehead for 1999 says Dave the
(1:45:05) argument that Andrew is making is that duties from the prism of theist morality entail the violation of self- ownership
(1:45:12) which the non-aggression principle banks on it's a contradiction of the two worldviews right B basically basically
(1:45:19) if I can interpret it what he's saying is if you adapt Christian eth eics then
(1:45:24) there is morality that comes from that that is directly oppositional to the idea of self- ownership no okay so like
(1:45:31) give me an example by conscription okay but in What scenario
(1:45:37) the in the most charitable scenario you can possibly think if you could if you can say conscription in the most
(1:45:43) charitable scenario fine but then maybe you just have to own the principle of conscription in general so if we're just
(1:45:51) going to argue that it's like yeah I think conscription in general is
(1:45:56) horrifically immoral yeah but like I mean there's at least certain cases where it's not
(1:46:02) right I I mean maybe yes maybe but but that's that's what he's getting okay fine fine but if we're gonna move out of
(1:46:09) just the realm of pure Theory into the realm of the real world then
(1:46:14) conscription has been pretty evil most of the times it's been used I don't
(1:46:21) actually disagree with that I think that there's moral objections to that but I'm not saying that I morally object
(1:46:27) necessarily to the duty of conscription though okay that's the thing fair enough fair enough but still you would grant
(1:46:33) that handing people the power of conscription could lead to bad results that handing anybody power for anything
(1:46:39) could lead to bad results fair enough we we agree with that vitellius for $20 says for the disconnect on ownership a
(1:46:46) person goes to a car lot and control can control a car but they don't own it a person can control their body and
(1:46:53) actions but not themselves God owns that person yeah I would say that that's true that that those who who move towards
(1:47:01) Divine command Theory would say that God has ownership of you you do not actually
(1:47:06) have ownership of you you you have a you have will that's true and maybe the only
(1:47:13) right that anybody's ever been able to really say is an actual right that I
(1:47:19) could maybe agree with is the right to free will but other than that I think I I'm not even sure that's a right because
(1:47:25) it seems like it's part of your just ontology it's how men are built and women are built it's part of what makes
(1:47:31) you you so I'm not even sure I would call that right I think it's um it's
(1:47:36) pretty clear to me that God has granted us with self- ownership and that doesn't
(1:47:43) mean that we can't do very bad things with that self- ownership or we can't do very good things with that um but most
(1:47:50) of the time that I'm talking to God I recognize that he has granted me the
(1:47:55) ability to do what I want to do um and
(1:48:01) in talking to him I'm recognizing that I know he wants me to do better than I'm
(1:48:07) doing but it's my choice whether I want to do that or not do you think does God own you no I mean I wouldn't say and
(1:48:15) when I say no I mean that I think God doesn't doesn't own me in the sense that
(1:48:21) I own anything that I own he's not just controlling me the way he wants to I think it's very clear and I think you'd
(1:48:28) agree with me on this Andrew that he's allowing me to decide have you ever
(1:48:33) prayed to God for intercession prayed to God for what
(1:48:38) intercession what is that I'm sorry like to intervene and help you in your
(1:48:43) life yeah many times so if if God intercedes on your behalf in order to
(1:48:50) help you in your life would he have to affect other people's will to do that well no not exactly not other people's
(1:48:57) will he'd have to uh affect what happens to people like I've never I've never
(1:49:04) prayed to God for him to like make someone who didn't want to come back to me come back to me or something like
(1:49:11) that no right yeah that seems kind of absurd right but it sounds like you're I pray to God to make sure that like my
(1:49:17) kids are okay sure sure but that's not that's not exactly like praying that
(1:49:22) like they're not I don't know that it's it's not a violation of their self- ownership or
(1:49:29) something like that but I've also never felt like look I've I've prayed to God to make sure and and by the it's very
(1:49:35) limited the things that I've prayed to God for and I I intentionally try to keep it this way because I try my best
(1:49:41) to never pray to God for things that are just like um self serving or fleeting or
(1:49:48) anything like that so I've prayed to God for my son to make it through his surgery okay I've prayed to God for my
(1:49:54) wife to give birth to my kids and be healthy and stuff like that um I but
(1:49:59) I've and and every single time I've ever prayed to God for those very important things I've always been making a deal
(1:50:07) with God in my mind which is a very weird thing that really convinces me that I'm right to believe in God but
(1:50:14) it's that I've always been making a deal where I go listen if God if you just make sure
(1:50:20) my son's okay I'll do X Y and Z and x y and z are always just bargaining with
(1:50:27) God yes yes sure but but X Y and Z is always just me being a good person and
(1:50:33) that's one of the things that really convinced me that God's real that I was like how do I have this like just deep impulse that God wants me to be a better
(1:50:40) person and I'll go listen if you do this I promise I'll you know whatever I'll
(1:50:46) I'll be a good father I'll be a good husband I'll be a good person all these things and
(1:50:53) while I was asking God to intervene in a certain way what I was promising was
(1:50:58) always something only I could control and I knew he wasn't going to like force me to do that or force me not
(1:51:05) to do that I knew that it was my decision but I also knew that he wanted me to do that let's assume for a second
(1:51:13) that God that uh God could put a truck in front of a he could convince the
(1:51:19) truck owner to put a truck in front of a prostitution house your son was about to walk into and he avoided that because
(1:51:26) God had convinced the person to park the truck there would you want him to
(1:51:34) um I uh I I think that my job is to raise my son well enough that that's not
(1:51:41) an issue but if it was but if it was I don't know you don't know like honestly
(1:51:46) I don't know I don't know and and I don't know because I'll say this right Andrew so
(1:51:53) I my kids grow up in a world so different than I grew up in and I don't
(1:51:58) I don't know that much about you or your story but I'll just tell you that like I grew up in um a pretty [ __ ] up
(1:52:06) environment and my kids are raised in a very loving environment like my my my
(1:52:13) kids are like I mean Jesus Christ they're just surrounded by love and they
(1:52:19) have everything they need and you know and so anyway my I I don't see my son ever
(1:52:27) being in that situation but I was certainly in that situation and I went
(1:52:33) through a lot of situations in my life that I don't know that God stopping me
(1:52:39) from going there was any better than me going there and then recognizing what
(1:52:44) that was and then learning from that so it's just a little it's a little bit difficult I just have one last Quick
(1:52:51) followup just really ask you know do you believe that Christ is God I don't know you don't know yeah I
(1:52:59) don't know I I honestly I just I I don't like um I don't have a strong opinion on
(1:53:05) what religion is right or wrong I just know that I found God after I had my
(1:53:10) kids and I've had a relationship with him ever since I'm telling you we're going to get you over to the dark side
(1:53:15) but anyway go ahead I don't know about that but we'll see we'll see I do appreciate the super chats are keep
(1:53:22) coming in so we're going to get through these real fast because we got a lot of callers so I'll try as fast as possible
(1:53:27) if you all have something you think's really important to say to one of these please go ahead but otherwise we'll Zoom
(1:53:32) through them so here we go we want we want to save at least an hour for callers hour I want to try to get them
(1:53:38) out at a hard three I did promise him that we would try to do that I did so
(1:53:43) all right so there's never been a society of 350 million people didn't have any a government Dave had no had to
(1:53:49) concede there are an infinite number of things in ancap can't account for most notably who fills the enforcement positions uh Department of I don't think
(1:53:57) that's right at all but okay fine sure my libertarian neighbor I shouldn't have read this one my libertarian neighbor
(1:54:02) posted a newspaper Ed selling his collection of star Che ships and here I thought he believed in free
(1:54:09) enterprise that's kind of funny come on that's funny that's pretty that's pretty good janner 531 for 20 bucks says it's
(1:54:15) an atheist lib who knows what's right and wrong with my deep cut failing answers the winner as much as I disagree at least he's consistent religious
(1:54:21) person the maps what thinks onto society's prescriptions uh JL says the father allows the prigal son to take his
(1:54:27) inherence and go waste it then once he becomes back to a sens he decides to repent come back to his father the father didn't force him to come back uh
(1:54:36) iron B iron ball sack for 1999 says debating is for bromos have Andrew on
(1:54:42) pop and have an actual conversation we are on the same page gang uh Ben George
(1:54:49) happy too Ben George for 20 bucks says listen listen Dave came in and he's
(1:54:54) running The Crucible that's why it's called The Crucible he is running The Crucible we're about to get to cers he's going to run more of The Crucible if
(1:55:01) Dave wants me to come on his program we're coming on the program it's reciprocal always absolutely happy to
(1:55:07) have you on all right Ben George for 20 bucks says God doesn't own you you give yourself to God and Trust in his will
(1:55:13) unfortunately people have given themselves over to the government even though no one trusts them JL says for 20
(1:55:18) bucks given that this is a paracle of the prodical son which was said previously B illustrates how God works with us what is your justification for
(1:55:25) thinking God has commanded us to enforce his Divine commandment you want to answer real quick or let's let's get to
(1:55:31) callers I'm sure that there'll be something reference that now real quick to the callers okay always save Casmir
(1:55:36) till last Cass go get yourself a nice drink we're going to give you the most time because you're the most adamant you
(1:55:42) are the libertarian Andrew so go take your time and do whatever you need Cass comes last so that's the rules all right
(1:55:48) that's fair so I'm going to ask just two things the callers one please abide by
(1:55:54) terms of service please if you want to yell at people that's fine I think everyone if they don't put on their
(1:56:00) camera and wave other than spoons we can't have them on Rob so so anybody who has your camera on you're going to get
(1:56:06) preferential treatment all right so cameras get preferential treatment other than spoons uh so let's start with
(1:56:12) spoons then and the other thing I'll ask is please we don't have 15 minutes for everyone unfortunately I wish we had
(1:56:19) more time but we don't so keep it to like five minutes back and forth ask a question maybe have one retort and
(1:56:25) that's it so okay spoons go ahead you're up
(1:56:30) first can't hear you why can I not hear you guys there you go can you hear us
(1:56:35) hold on a second okay real quick second spoons all right spoons you we get you
(1:56:42) next spoons all right if cir's less then we're gonna go to speo go ahead speo
(1:56:47) you're up Hey can you hear me yes yeah awesome okay uh oh damn I have my
(1:56:53) virtual camera okay uh so question so Dave you showed um uh you you have a
(1:56:58) book there you said I own the book yeah right so the book is yours yeah you
(1:57:05) paid money for it it's in your possession so let's assume that this book for just for a minute because I'm
(1:57:11) trying to to help kind of like show you the delineation between ownership and duty this book were you to read it would
(1:57:19) give you the ability to become a sign significantly better human being primarily to your family nobody else
(1:57:27) knows this aside from you nobody else gives one single [ __ ] whether you read the book or not your your kids aren't
(1:57:33) going to give a [ __ ] your wife's not going to give a [ __ ] nobody's going to know the [ __ ] difference whether you read the [ __ ] book or not do you
(1:57:41) however feel like you have some moral imperative to read the book to become a better person well I mean it depends on what
(1:57:49) the book is doesn't matter what the book is it the book could literally have the word t in it just by the nature of you
(1:57:56) opening the book and reading that letter T magical [ __ ] happens and you become a significantly better person for everyone
(1:58:03) around you but you're the only person that knows this to be the fact I I'm not I'm not sure what the
(1:58:09) question is so so let's say that I do I I re reading
(1:58:15) a book about something that I care about might make me a better person is that
(1:58:20) the question you know it's going to you know it's going to make you a better person just by opening the cover do you
(1:58:25) have a duty and obligation if you knew that that book would make you a better person for your family to read it um I I
(1:58:32) would say yes in in a sense so like if I'm uh if if
(1:58:39) uh okay well go let him let let D
(1:58:44) respond the a funny that's a funny mic drop moment [ __ ] got this
(1:58:50) [ __ ] with that take that Dave well look I mean I think that I have and
(1:58:56) I've felt this way particularly so I have uh I have two kids uh my daughter is my oldest she's five and my boy is
(1:59:03) two but I've really felt this more since I had a son although I'm sure this was true when I just had a daughter also but
(1:59:11) that I do feel like if I'm gonna be a guy who's out on shows you know talking
(1:59:18) about what I believe in then I better know something about what I think believe in and so you know if I'm
(1:59:23) reading a book about whatever like maybe it's you know I have a debate on the um
(1:59:31) the war going on in the territory one region right that one region that region
(1:59:39) that was uh go YouTube has their rules and then the New York Times you're not allowed to say occupied territor so if I
(1:59:47) if I were to have opinion on the territory which has been
(1:59:54) has had other people in it for many years just stop just stop just just
(2:00:02) button it up Dave button it up let's say if I were to do a debate about that like
(2:00:07) and and I'm trying I yeah I think me reading up about and knowing what I'm talking about yes I do find that there's
(2:00:14) some sense of Duty I have because that's the that's like the impression that I
(2:00:20) want to give to my kids is that they're supposed to you're supposed to know something about what you're talking about and you're supposed to care about
(2:00:26) it and you're supposed to stand up for the truth even if it's a little a little bit inconvenient for you so yeah gotcha
(2:00:33) okay all right uh remember we're prioritizing people with their by the way I got I got a a woman from the New
(2:00:40) York Times came up to me at the uh outside of the libertarian convention and interviewed me for a bit and I was
(2:00:46) like what's it like to talk about the occupied territories when you're not allowed to say occupied territories
(2:00:52) she's H yeah by the way she just laughed she thought it was so funny it's actually
(2:00:58) pretty funny it is funny all right Jacob go ahead what's up Jacob I'm still mad
(2:01:04) that you didn't let me use my line Dave I'm still I'm pretty I'm gonna you know what somehow I'm gonna like get it in
(2:01:09) this whatever this next exchange is I'm getting it in there I'm getting it Inc
(2:01:14) is the reason I'm here by the way I'm glad you guys kissed and and and made up I was uh we had a rough opening a little
(2:01:22) of a rough opening there uh so I a question for Andrew Andrew you said that taking money from like one person or one
(2:01:28) party to pay another uh is is theft uh but not when they're using it to like
(2:01:34) build infrastructure no no it can it can be it can be theft it depends on how it equates to Christian Duty so what is
(2:01:41) duty to the state what is duty to the church and what is duty to you so you do
(2:01:46) have an obligation to give to Caesar what is Caesars and we do think that you get the government that you deserve and
(2:01:52) the reason you get the government that you deserve is because you are the moral Arbiter of the things which are around
(2:01:59) you that's what will is and we do have exactly the government that we deserve
(2:02:05) but but but what's but what's the because I'm trying to find your standard for when it's theft and when it isn't because you said if they're taking it
(2:02:11) from like rich people to give it to uh you know a demographic on immutable
(2:02:17) characteristics that was your argument you would say by Christian ethics that immoral no no no only so so here's the
(2:02:25) thing only that it could be the thing is is that taxation that's it right it's all about
(2:02:32) Nuance right the thing is is that it could be so the question is when does it
(2:02:37) become that's what you're asking me like when does was X taking from you become
(2:02:43) theft this a harder question to answer and even under Christian ethics or any ethical system when you are going to
(2:02:51) deprive what we have socially constructed to be property we're going to have to have some kind of value ad
(2:02:56) here to figure out what your duty is so you basically we'd have to take this on a Case by case to make a determination
(2:03:03) that's why I was asking for the delineation of where the case is but then like on your system because you're advocating for a Christian Society with
(2:03:11) Christian government like what wouldn't these Christians just pay for these things voluntarily anyway is the is the other point but it seems to me course
(2:03:18) that's why I brought up Social programs so so under social program the answer is probably yes but what
(2:03:24) about infrastructure if we come to infrastructure or conscription or
(2:03:30) uh having hang on let me finish I'm almost done or defending the Homeland if you have a conscription and you have the
(2:03:36) military Defending Your Homeland from Attack is that unethical I'm I'm not so
(2:03:41) sure that it is bro not it just seems to me that I don't see a clear standard
(2:03:46) here because even with infrastructure you're still just taking money from one group of people to give to another it's all just redistribution from a central
(2:03:54) plan yeah but redistribu the argument of redistribution is not my argument simply
(2:03:59) redistributing because that's how Caesar chooses to do things necessarily doesn't
(2:04:05) necessarily mean it's theft no we have biblical standards for what theft is but well I'm still not getting what the um
(2:04:13) I'm just curious what's the standard when be isn't it well it would be case use so we would have to we would have to
(2:04:20) balance Duty versus the case use the same with conscription yes no I I mean
(2:04:26) I'm I'm just asking when would it be theft when wouldn't it be it depends on what the example is as to what your
(2:04:33) state Duties are under Christian ethics and when those duties come into play
(2:04:39) okay I just same thing with conscription right that's why that's why BR bring up the counter example of conscription if
(2:04:46) conscription is moral then this would mean that funding the Army would be moral as well and so you would have to
(2:04:52) necessarily tax the populist for this is that immoral I don't think it is no I don't think uh I don't think conscription is moral but I'm just
(2:04:59) saying you're you're claiming that we have a subjective you know metric but
(2:05:06) what's yours well I would say that you are going to get the representative government which is part of the value of
(2:05:14) the morality of the public and you are to give to no I don't like voting at
(2:05:21) all that and that passit render under Caesar does not support paying taxation because if it
(2:05:27) did would not have walked away Amazed by his they were trying to trap him a great
(2:05:33) there's a great misus Institute article on this how they were trying and this is just biblical theology Christian uh
(2:05:40) fathers have talked about this that they were the Pharisees were it's in the scripture they were trying to entrap him
(2:05:45) and if he would have said yeah pay your taxes he would have been discredited to the entire crowd and all of his
(2:05:51) followers and instead his answer was basically throwing it back in their face saying and what about the parable of the
(2:05:57) talons the parable of the tal has nothing the parable no but it but wait who are you making money for for the
(2:06:03) parable of the talons it it was for the uh the remember the master the master the
(2:06:12) master that's the parable of the talent right property so yeah hang on hang on stop stop you had an obligation under
(2:06:18) the parable of the talons to use your talents or I'm sorry under the parable of talents to use your talents in order
(2:06:24) to make more money for the master right and we're equating this Parable and why
(2:06:32) are we equating this Parable to there he's basically saying look um don't be a [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] and when you're
(2:06:39) tasked with a duty you should essentially give it do it don't be lazy don't be lazy don't do this but there is
(2:06:45) a master inside of this Parable and the thing is is that could the state be that Master yeah think it could be under the
(2:06:52) under certain circumstances can we scale some things back sure but we would have to take it on a case use which is
(2:06:59) exactly what Dave's advocating a case use fine come over to the side though
(2:07:04) okay okay Jacob we give the last word here and then we got to get to the next one I know we get other callers so yeah I mean we'll have to get into this
(2:07:10) another time I also just want to say Dave when you have Andrew on part of the problem you guys please need to talk about I'm I'm tired of hearing this dumb
(2:07:17) myth from Michael nolles and Andrew and I told this when I was on his show a couple weeks ago that Libertarians dup the conservative
(2:07:25) movement and the neocons are just like libertarianism is not egalitarian I'd love I'd love to talk about that you
(2:07:31) guys need to talk about that okay sure I'm happy to happy happy to get into whatever uh Mr Smith would like uh to
(2:07:38) get into but yeah the thing is Jacob is like I I don't believe that you think
(2:07:44) ultimately I think that I can give you many scenarios where taxation you wouldn't consider it to be theft
(2:07:49) including conscription for the Homeland and so the thing is is I don't know how we could adjudicate this except on a
(2:07:55) caseby casee basis where we can apply the ethical standard to it you know what's interesting is I think that the
(2:08:02) ethical standard that you're even implying there is something that's kind of consistent with libertarianism so
(2:08:09) you're almost saying conscription would be justified if what if we were
(2:08:14) defending our own Homeland right like you're saying if there was an invading Army you could force the men to defend
(2:08:23) their Homeland and that would be justified well that would not be uh libertarian ethics because no but no no
(2:08:29) no that's not what I'm asking I'm just asking about what no no you said it would be in line with libertarian ethics
(2:08:34) and it couldn't be because you are forcing them to do okay fine fine so you're right it's not exactly in line
(2:08:41) but I'm saying that it would only be the only scenario where you could justify conscription would be if someone was
(2:08:49) attacking our homeland and you were saying hey we're forcing the able boded to defend even if you situation where we
(2:08:56) could taking someone else I'm a big believer in preemptive strikes or that
(2:09:01) you could have a greater moral duty if there are enough uh problems happening inside of a society uh where you would
(2:09:09) have a moral obligation to intervene in that Society I think that that's I think that that's totally acceptable okay
(2:09:16) right Jacob thank you so much for the call really appreciate it all right Jacob thank you by the way it's good to
(2:09:21) see you again Jacob all right and by the way thanks for vouching for me while it started off rough I think me and Mr
(2:09:27) Smith are going to be Pals out of all this I do I think we're coming great we're becoming great friends all right
(2:09:32) not before you go I just want to say objectively Andrew's lost the debate he said he was gonna make that comedian
(2:09:39) joke here uh he did not do it he that's true that is an L for Andrew
(2:09:44) on that one that's true I'll take the L on that all right not your dude uh go
(2:09:50) ahead hey Dave so you admitted at one point that you find it difficult to come to the ultimate basis of morality
(2:09:57) without God so would you agree that Concepts like morality can't be empirically
(2:10:02) verified yeah look I mean I think that um there there is something about as as
(2:10:10) we talked about earlier the hoppan argumentation ethics that I think does
(2:10:15) kind of do an end around the isau uh dichotomy and and I think there is
(2:10:20) something to that but that being said yeah I don't to get to a place of true
(2:10:28) like right and wrong I don't know that you can get there without believing in
(2:10:34) something bigger than the realm that we're existing in right now so why did you seem to keep rejecting the idea of
(2:10:41) divine command like it seemed like you found it laughable that that would be a moral basis I don't I don't think it's
(2:10:48) laughable I was saying that I guess that's the same thing I have is that you know I was just saying what I found
(2:10:55) laugh do side with da dog side well what I found laughable was saying that there's nothing on my side beyond that
(2:11:03) and then claiming the response is also that that's all I was saying but yeah
(2:11:09) but so so you know in the future there's any reference to the same assertion that you make and I say well I just reference
(2:11:15) it the same way it puts us on equal footing so that we can have continue the discussion external to whatever this bog
(2:11:23) down is that's why I'm just able to Grant these things quickly so that we can try to get to the heart of the thing
(2:11:28) you know what I mean no and I agree with that I don't look I don't as I said I
(2:11:33) don't really think there's even though I remember before I found God being an
(2:11:41) atheist and thinking that's crazy we can all just know what right and wrong is
(2:11:46) but the more you think about it you go yeah there really is no way to get it
(2:11:51) isy difficult with with and and in a sense the reason why so many atheists
(2:11:58) feel that way is because they already do believe whether they know it or not that that's the thing they they know they
(2:12:06) definitely know it's a cognitive dissonance that's why so many of them are douchebags yes look I I tend to agree
(2:12:13) with you on that I think that it's it's a it's something that
(2:12:18) weirdly I don't know that all of them know I think a lot of them don't know but they just have aide them there
(2:12:26) there's a thing that's inside us that tells us what's right and wrong and a lot of people want to pretend that they
(2:12:32) don't need God in order to know that but it doesn't really make sense without it
(2:12:38) I just have one more comment I know there's a lot of callers though uh the churches that you mention as getting
(2:12:43) more Community influence under libertarianism they necessarily believe that their Eternal governance is going
(2:12:50) to be one that's wor utterly submitting to even to the point of prostrating before like the head of it all
(2:12:58) so by necessity we believe that spreading in Mass like a Christian worldview into the government is a
(2:13:03) better solution than just diminishing it to the point of it being almost arbitrary in a lot of
(2:13:09) respects if I can jump in that was to me where I thought the heart of the debate was like if we both agree that there is
(2:13:16) this morality that we like God or Christianity I think you would agree 98% on what your morality is and where it
(2:13:22) comes from the question is which system is best to get there and I think Dave's
(2:13:28) compelling argument is the larger the government gets the more culturally we go to this stuff and Andrew's argument
(2:13:34) is yeah but we also are always going to see this stuff which is why it's better
(2:13:39) to have a system of sort of Christian governance that would through almost Fiat executive Fiat punish and diminish
(2:13:47) these sorts of things why I've always said move that we can move the Smiths of
(2:13:53) the world to the dark side because they necessarily see and you know what Dave I think you would agree with this it's
(2:13:58) when you have that first kid right that you start to see the cracks right you start to go ah wait a second wait a
(2:14:07) second here maybe there is a system of ODS that we should adhere to and uh
(2:14:13) maybe a little bit of uh going over that whole um you know non-aggression
(2:14:19) principle maybe maybe we should maybe we should sometime it's that first kid that does
(2:14:25) it Am I Wrong um well no I don't agree with the I I do agree with the spirit of
(2:14:30) what you're saying not necessarily with the non-aggression principle I think that um to the uh not your dude to your
(2:14:37) uh point I don't think there's anything more arbitrary or less arbitrary about it being you know controlled by the
(2:14:44) government or being controlled by localities I think that what I realized when I had that first kid was that yes
(2:14:52) there was something that mattered more than
(2:14:58) me and that uh mattered far outside of me so it didn't it didn't
(2:15:05) matter no you gotta go I'm sorry bro dude thank you for the comment
(2:15:10) appreciate it let's get to maap POS 3 go ahead
(2:15:19) sir hey how's it going guys can you hear me yeah what's up dude good yep uh great
(2:15:24) debate by the way Dave Smith thank you for being so charitable and so um good faith it was nice to see that from the libertarian side apologies I'm pretty
(2:15:31) sick I'm crazy but my question to you Dave Smith uh what under your
(2:15:36) libertarian Society if we were to scale it on a societal level okay ideally uh what safeguards would you
(2:15:44) implement against this degeneracy that you kind of conceited to that is kind of
(2:15:49) spreading out and kind of taking hold in society which luckily you both agreed
(2:15:54) that is not a good thing um what safeguards would you put in place to um
(2:15:59) to suppress this and more importantly what would these safeguards be informed
(2:16:05) by what would be informed by and then secondly how could you enforce these safeguards without a foundational moral
(2:16:11) grounding absent God and then how do you implement these safeguards while not violating the
(2:16:18) nap sure that's that's a really good question so I think that okay in the same sense that Andrew
(2:16:26) I'm sure you um CU all I knew you for from before this podcast was like uh
(2:16:33) your stuff on the uh um whatever podcast whatever podcast yes so um I think one
(2:16:41) of the things that you probably would agree with about you know the state of
(2:16:48) uh young women into today's crazy Society is that there aren't these and
(2:16:56) there's something really sad about this that I don't think any of us necessarily love but is just the reality of it is
(2:17:03) that you kind of need these disaster stories to happen in order to provide an
(2:17:13) incentive for everybody else to not be a part of that you know and like you could
(2:17:18) think about like um what what I'm trying to say is so e even if you think about like um the law I think I get it like
(2:17:24) social shaming so that we can put these people up and show don't be like this essentially sure like in the in the same
(2:17:31) sense that if somebody doesn't get health insurance and is like I'm not going to pay for health insurance and
(2:17:36) I'm going to ride my motorcycle at [ __ ] 90 miles an hour and eventually they they [ __ ] themselves up real bad
(2:17:44) like I'm not saying you don't want them to get taken care of but there's also something where when they're an example
(2:17:50) that goes real bad you go that's why everyone else gets insurance doesn't
(2:17:56) exceed the speed limit you know what I mean like does and there's something about that where but that's like basic
(2:18:02) that's basically all law so all law is is essentially tailored to the outlier
(2:18:07) right the outlier does something [ __ ] up and ruins it for everybody else sure but I think that government by its
(2:18:14) nature tends to pervert these incentives so it tends to say hey if you're a sing
(2:18:20) Le mother don't worry we have a safety net for you if you do this don't worry
(2:18:26) we have a safety net for you I I disagree I think that government types there's different government types I
(2:18:31) think that in a fool bir democracy sure that that's what you're going to see because that's what people uh are used
(2:18:39) to uh looking at due to the fact of sensationalism media sensationalism but
(2:18:44) I would equally put this burden on corporatism and NOS going in yeah go ahead so are you're
(2:18:52) saying government does this when it's Democratic yeah I'm saying that I think
(2:18:57) that uh you could have a per perfect authoritarianism uh at least in theory
(2:19:04) where most of this type of stuff doesn't happen uh or you can have pure democracy where all of this stuff does happen or
(2:19:11) you could have perfect democracy where none of this stuff happens and this is because I think that most of it revolves
(2:19:16) around the moral foundation of the people group who push these types of in other words I don't think necessarily
(2:19:23) any single type of government is more or less immoral rather the people which
(2:19:29) prop the government up are more or less immoral so okay so I guess where we would maybe disagree is that I would
(2:19:35) argue that government by its very nature is taking from one group of people and
(2:19:42) giving to another it can be that way yes no I I mean I think that there's actually no other way it can be that
(2:19:49) government by its very nature is taking from one group and giving to another group then this is what humanity is
(2:19:55) demanding that they do then perhaps sure and if it is if it is what humanity is
(2:20:00) demanding they have their own ownership of themselves to make the decision that
(2:20:06) that's what they want well that's a whole different claim but I'm just saying that government by its very
(2:20:11) nature is taking from one group and giving to another and by that very nature they're taking from the group
(2:20:17) that is supposedly has something good and give it to the group that has a not good like that's that that's the very
(2:20:25) nature of it and by doing that they're disincentivizing being good and incentivizing being not good if you were
(2:20:32) a singular person problem worse I don't think so so here's my rebuttal if you're
(2:20:37) a singular person who owned half of the land in the United States by yourself
(2:20:43) you owned it you through um minations were able to acrew enough wealth to do
(2:20:48) so and all the people on that land had to live by your laws because it's your
(2:20:53) land are you saying that that's redistributive that you said no of
(2:20:59) course not right so the thing is is that if you're talking about monarchies where the land ownership is generally with one
(2:21:04) person why indeed would that be problematic or redistributive and that's a
(2:21:10) government yes but okay we could get into that that's a very interesting conversation but um uh whether you're
(2:21:16) saying that you said two different things there whether it's a monarchy or whether it's a person who owns the land
(2:21:23) same same what's the distin well not exactly but but sure but again this is
(2:21:28) that is something we could have a three-hour uh debate on but talk
(2:21:36) iose real quick final word Yeah Yeah final word uh just final thing for you day Smith if it could be proven to you
(2:21:42) somehow just clearly Libertarians have a huge issue with the size of government if it if it could be proven to you that
(2:21:49) under a CHR Church Christian ethic um informed law and informed Society if it
(2:21:56) could be proven to you that this is better than your system as far as grounding the actual good and bad which
(2:22:03) you would want as well if it could be proven that that they have the better claim to that and they would not be
(2:22:09) affected by the size of government would you then be forced to concede that it is a better system and would you adhere to
(2:22:15) it there thus having the better out the better results the better outcomes all the things that you want they just
(2:22:21) happen to have God under that thing would you concede to that if it could be proven to
(2:22:26) you yeah sure okay [ __ ] epic I love that I love that I mean yeah but at the
(2:22:33) same time I think either one of you guys should also answer that question in the opposite direction like if it be proven
(2:22:40) the answer is no even if it was proven be proven to you that that outcomes were better yeah no no no if it could be
(2:22:46) proven to you not just that outcomes are better but that God was on the side of people who believed in small government
(2:22:53) and that it was a better outcome and God belied in that wait a second if you could demonstrate that that was part of
(2:22:59) divine command that would be different but that wasn't really what was baked in was whether it was part of divine
(2:23:04) command but the outcome itself so even if the outcome itself of like every there was a little bit of both baked in
(2:23:11) there but okay sure well what he was baking in was saying let's assume that I came to all of the Christian positions
(2:23:17) absent being a Christian and we could demonstrate that the comes of that were better than libertarianism wouldn't you
(2:23:22) move towards that that's what he's asking okay fine but if but same
(2:23:28) question to you in the say if it was baked into the question that the Christian outcomes were better in
(2:23:34) limited government would that make you someone who supported limited government no outcomes themselves are not part of
(2:23:41) Christian ethics that's part I mean well sorry let
(2:23:46) me rep they're part of Christian ethics but they're not the some total of Christian ethics let me reframe so that
(2:23:51) we're clear so the answer would be no ultimately we would still have to adhere to what divine command is even if we
(2:23:58) could demonstrate for instance if you if if you murdered every second son the outcomes for society were better we
(2:24:03) still wouldn't do it if it would be demonstrated to you that the Divine outcome or the Divine uh intervention
(2:24:11) was that there should be limited government and also that limited government would lead to more Christian
(2:24:16) outcomes would you support limited government if anything that you said could be demonstrated as a Divine
(2:24:21) command then yes we follow that if it could be demonstrated sure CH post thank you so much I was just going to say real
(2:24:28) quick on that because I know I've heard Andrew talk about this a lot the idea of utilitarianism and outcomes right the
(2:24:34) the real quick question I have for you Andrew is in a world of divine command Christian populism would you think that
(2:24:41) all sins should be illegal no given that if you say
(2:24:47) sometimes there are sins that you would socially shame but not be illegal could it not be true if it's proven through
(2:24:54) Dave's interpretation outcomes are best because you're and so so this is where you might
(2:25:01) um see to like um a threshold deontology where you can say the duty always takes
(2:25:07) precedent unless the outcome is so horrific that you have to move the duty over right but always the duty would
(2:25:13) still have to be within the framework of Christian Christianity and Christian ethics yeah okay uh spoons can you hear
(2:25:20) us now uh yes finally there we go okay so um
(2:25:25) that was rather contentious um I hope everyone's calm down now um I'll keep this brief so I don't have to hold
(2:25:31) anyone else up um let me try and steal man this uh conversation in in a few
(2:25:37) sentences I would say Dave argu Dave's argument is that the government has eroded so much of society social
(2:25:45) capability and without its bureaucratic overreach these former organs should in theory
(2:25:50) rejuvenate and Carries um Society social functions once again and Andrew's
(2:25:56) argument is that the state absent the organs of the church fully functioning still need to exist to enforce morality
(2:26:03) or else humans will essentially degrade into degeneracy and die very much the Juan dooso Cortez argument I would argue
(2:26:10) that if you're contemplating ways to uh reorganize Society because you're in
(2:26:16) need of mitigating the overreach of immoral actors in the what you're dealing with really is a
(2:26:22) crisis of Great Men in society so democracy is a natural and so is the concept of picking people as members of
(2:26:29) the state so sayth Robert filmer um which I'm sure Mr Smith has read and if he hasn't he should because then he can
(2:26:35) be a real libertarian and become a monarchist you're incorrect in one part of this so I appreciated the steel man
(2:26:43) but actually the heart of my argument was not just based around the idea that
(2:26:49) you need to have government enforcement in order to stop degeneracy which I would agree is true to at least some
(2:26:55) extent I think even Dave would but rather uh the idea of self-ownership ship itself being the
(2:27:01) justification for um not having a government which would enforce this so
(2:27:08) that would be my one push back towards you and I think that that's key and while while me and Dave at first he he
(2:27:14) kind of thought maybe this is pedantic or maybe this guy is being bad faith or whatever because he probably hasn't seen
(2:27:20) the push back on that particular argument I do think that it's a super important argument because it's a
(2:27:26) bottomline pillar yeah it's a pillar which supports this you see what I'm saying yeah so
(2:27:32) that would be my one push back to the Steelman yeah this um it was kind of weird because I was trying to figure out
(2:27:38) what is Andrew actually trying to say and then there was one point where you said you basically want the social
(2:27:44) contract to be Beyond just a social contract like it needs to be I won't say reinforced but backed up by
(2:27:50) a higher power yeah I think that it's necessary for us to have a moral society and this
(2:27:56) is what Dave is alluding to as well so he's saying when it comes to his moral ODS he has to go to the Divine or he
(2:28:03) just doesn't have any and this is my kind of problem with this idea of self-ownership institutionally anyway
(2:28:10) and why I think that this kind of collapses on itself over and over again yeah all right uh spoons thank you so
(2:28:17) much appreciate the call yeah appreciate it man yeah hey real cheers to you spoons he is a friend of mine from I
(2:28:24) don't know some European [ __ ] hole who the [ __ ] nobody cares about European [ __ ] holes but anyway next call worry we
(2:28:30) got another we don't worry the accents we're saving them for the end huh so uh
(2:28:35) all right we got grid Motorsports go ahead grid hey how are you guys what's
(2:28:41) up dude good Dave uh I really actually really appreciated uh your arguments
(2:28:48) um as effective as they were um it's it's tough it's tough arguing with
(2:28:53) Andrew um I have just a couple of things and I'll be I'll try to be as quick as I
(2:28:59) can um I was very curious um do you
(2:29:04) consider our current government a a failed
(2:29:11) Republic is that to Dave the question is to Da yeah to Dave do you do you consider our current current government
(2:29:16) a um failed Republic back your your mouth away from the mic by the way GD
(2:29:22) yeah I I I don't know dude it's it's a weird thing to Listen to Someone Like This ask you a question with like a
(2:29:27) backhanded insult like uh in front of it like I liked your arguments as ineffectual as they were as he swallows
(2:29:34) his mic like it's a big dick I don't know what who are you
(2:29:40) dude you're just gonna go straight to the adom and not answer the the question no no that's exactly what I'm going to
(2:29:47) do who like it's just a weird thing for someone like this to like just throw
(2:29:52) down an insult and then ask a question as if I'm going to like really entertain it after that yeah okay what else you
(2:30:01) got buddy anything else grid M Sports I actually didn't think that was
(2:30:08) I I felt like I was being fairly nice I guess I wasn't all right well thank you
(2:30:13) for the call G as ineffectual as your arguments were I thought you were quite
(2:30:18) handsome for an ugly man so thanks I'm just messing with you man thanks for calling in uh but is it am I crazy that
(2:30:26) it's a weird way to just ask a question of somebody no I know I always let that [ __ ] roll
(2:30:34) off personally I guess listen I'm on your show in front of your audience do you want to answer if you would like to
(2:30:41) answer the question no okay I don't even remember what it was are we a failed Republic I mean sure yeah I guess I
(2:30:49) assume that he was going to have contention with the word Republic is my guess I mean at at one point were was
(2:30:56) the United States of America a republic yeah I think there's a strong argument for that and are we a failed Republic I
(2:31:03) think we're we're a republic who became an Empire you know which is pretty
(2:31:08) common and then it failed okay uh next I don't know Andrew
(2:31:13) do you disagree with that by the way with like saying that we're we were a republic that became an Empire well we
(2:31:19) were Republic that became a democracy is yeah kind of similar though
(2:31:25) yeah kind of is it kind of is similar but it's a republic that allowed women like relle to vote and [ __ ] us
(2:31:32) all not women like me not women like and and by the way also women like the
(2:31:39) previous caller he also got to vote eat the mic okay maybe maybe you're
(2:31:45) right Andrew I should have let that rolled off my it's all right good Michelle go ahead okay I I want to
(2:31:53) introduce um a framework that I've created it's the three spars of government there's criminal commercial
(2:31:59) and social and so criminal is violent crime um and there you're justified in
(2:32:05) throwing people in prison and using violent Force to stop their criminal
(2:32:10) acts and then there's commercial which is going to be running the economy the currency banking um stopping fraud and
(2:32:18) there the punishment is is um fines and if they don't comply boycotts
(2:32:24) blacklisting and then everything else is in Social the social sphere government
(2:32:30) and the they can't use violence against you but they can use you got to get to the question what's the
(2:32:37) question so like do you think that the government should come in and throw you in prison for smoking cigarettes no okay
(2:32:46) so you think it should be a social well maybe you don't maybe you think it should be be accepted that a a social
(2:32:52) sphere um rule that there should be social norms and these can be organized these can be like an actual organized
(2:32:58) government that you can be a citizen of and if you don't follow the rules they kick you out and you don't get benefits
(2:33:04) anymore like a Covenant Community yeah yeah and so like I think there's this
(2:33:09) huge disconnect where where you're not understanding that like yes it can be wrong to do all of these things but it's
(2:33:16) yeah but I don't think this is wrong well I think it is so yeah I know I know but if if you're just making the
(2:33:22) assertion of thing wrong then I'll just make the assertion back thing not wrong tell me why I'm wrong well then we can
(2:33:28) say the same thing when when you say anything about any of the rules that right which means it would come back
(2:33:33) down to force Doctrine which is the entire thing that we're is at the heart of our argument which is around ownership that's the whole point so if
(2:33:40) you assert that smoking is wrong I just assert that it's not wrong and then the burden falls on you to tell me why it is
(2:33:45) wrong AB well it doesn't exactly the burden doesn't exact listen I don't exactly agree with relle but the burden
(2:33:52) doesn't exactly fall back on anyone else if anything you've made it 50/50 so sure
(2:33:58) sure anything it's not it's not that the burden falls back on someone else it's that you just haven't proven your case
(2:34:03) anymore than they prove but we don't need to if it's just a preference assertion then it's just going to come
(2:34:08) down to force right Dave well ye yes but the I'm right no no no not at all so the
(2:34:16) burden doesn't come back to the other person you're not right in that what you're right in is saying that and by
(2:34:21) the way the person says you shouldn't huh if the person says that you should
(2:34:27) not you should not do thing X the other person says why that is your
(2:34:34) burden no not exactly it it's okay so you say someone shouldn't be gay yeah
(2:34:42) that would be my burden AR and the same way that someone said to you you shouldn't smoke and then
(2:34:49) say why not why not yeah so the burden Falls to you why not no the burden would
(2:34:54) fall to them why not wait the burden can't fall to them both times yeah fall in them both times so if you ask me why
(2:35:01) is homosexuality wrong if I assert that it is the burd is on me to demonstrate why it is if you say smoking is wrong
(2:35:06) and I say okay why is smoking wrong the burden falls on you both times wait wait
(2:35:12) hold on hold on on so the burden for homosexuality falls to the person doing
(2:35:17) it right no the Bur would fall in the person saying you shouldn't do it so that's you so what's so what do you say
(2:35:23) to that uh the well I have several arguments against homosexuality the
(2:35:29) first of which being it's a non reproductive promotable activity which is terrible for [ __ ] society smoking
(2:35:36) is bad too can be perhaps but it does not promote by the way I'm So Pro I would
(2:35:44) say that I support smoking I would say hang on I would say that knowing that you're going to have a cigarette after
(2:35:49) you have sex leads to the reproductive activity of sex even more Dave that's a
(2:35:54) weak argument why you laughing Dave you know it's great as I said at the beginning I
(2:36:02) picked an argument I didn't believe in at all I man I think it's so lame that I
(2:36:07) vape and you smoke you win you win it is [ __ ] lame stop [ __ ] vaping dude what the hell is wrong with you you know
(2:36:14) what it was relle do you have a last comment because we callers to get to
(2:36:19) running out of time so last comment real quick because both put a burden on the Healthcare System whether you're
(2:36:25) spreading STDs or you are getting lung cancer you're putting system why is that because
(2:36:32) you're you're costing money for everybody who's paying in and whether and why is that
(2:36:38) bad because we want to live in a functional Society where everything is super expensive so it's just down to your preferences you want to live in a
(2:36:44) functional Society she's she's got a better listen Michelle's not doing the best no it's not a good argument it's
(2:36:51) coming down to preferences bro no it's not decent you're imposing your will on other people and so there there's an
(2:36:57) argument there I by the way argue against smoking cigarettes smoking cigarettes is so goddamn cool I wish I
(2:37:04) was what are you but I mean what are you fighting against here all we've done been able to do very quickly is reduce
(2:37:10) us down to preference and if it's just preference what's my preference to smoke it's your preference to have this Society those aren't good grounded
(2:37:16) foundations for an argument you just haven't sure I you can say that but it's
(2:37:21) just I don't know then you still haven't won the argument at best what you've done is tie all I I don't need to win
(2:37:27) the argument if you say it's just a preference and I say it's a preference back you haven't Justified why I shouldn't do the thing so therefore I'll
(2:37:33) just continue to do the thing it's not my burden it's not my burden I think what Andrew said because
(2:37:41) the extension of this argument correct me if I'm wrong Andrew where you're going is this is why Force Doctrine is what's important right because you need
(2:37:47) to persuade you have to have some sort of backing and you need to be able to persuade and be able to use Force to
(2:37:53) stop Ander because otherwise it seems self-evident to us like well yes a workable Health Care system is good but
(2:38:00) where do we ground our morality from well Christian ethics or the ethics of
(2:38:05) God if you don't have those ethics at the end your underpinning is going to be subjective in some way and and so it's
(2:38:13) just going to come down to who can enforce whatever their preference is well if if the argument is that whoever
(2:38:19) enforce their will will be able to sure yeah that's right but that's what the argument of preference always comes down
(2:38:26) to that's right that's my whole argument that is my whole argument but no one's
(2:38:31) arguing that that's clearly and right now right now Andrew Joe Biden and his
(2:38:38) administration can enforce their will on you that's right but the thing is is can they do it from a Justified position or
(2:38:45) a preferential position now no no no no now you just moved back into a different territory so can they justify it okay
(2:38:52) that's a whole different thing but if it's not justified it's a preference and I don't think might makes right would
(2:38:58) agree with me that might makes okay yeah but that's what I just said yeah but you're making my argument
(2:39:04) for me that's why we would reduce for Shell down to is this anything other than an axiomatic preference if the
(2:39:09) answer is no then why the [ __ ] do I care if you don't absent the force what do I care sure you got to get he's he's
(2:39:17) actually smoking a cigar so his want to say both of you guys are a bunch of [ __ ] like vape cigarette why don't
(2:39:23) you get a cigar you guys cigar all right Fair wait wait wait wait wait I know
(2:39:28) shut up Andrew this is for the shut up go ahead Glenn with your question um
(2:39:34) one I have a problem with Dave talking about us motorcycle riders driving really fast okay don't ever do that
(2:39:40) again I will find you um come find me [ __ ] uh so the argument seems to
(2:39:48) be more based on what Christian ethics versus libertarian
(2:39:54) like what what what is a Libertarian a Libertarian is just a conservative that likes
(2:40:00) drugs what all right yeah like like every libertarian I know wants to promote shrooms and drugs and stuff like
(2:40:06) that well but why Glenn's because they own themselves right yeah that's that's
(2:40:11) the really I think the heart of this I agree come on I agree I mean I mean and
(2:40:17) what is okay and what is the the Christian who wants to ride a motorcycle and not do shrooms does he not own
(2:40:23) himself that's me that's me okay so do you not own yourself yeah I'm not sure
(2:40:30) see this is what this is what's so stupid about this is that someone wanting to do mushrooms is the same
(2:40:36) claim of self- ownership as someone not wanting to do mushrooms how this because
(2:40:41) your claim is that you own yourself so you don't want to do it listen how about this that doesn't logically follow yes
(2:40:49) it does no it doesn't so follow if you if you say uh well nobody owns you and
(2:40:56) you don't own you so you can do whatever the [ __ ] you want right because there's just there's no ownership of anything
(2:41:02) right uh then you can do mushrooms however if you make the claim that we ought to be able to do mushrooms without
(2:41:08) anybody enforcing their will on us then that is making a different claim which is that you ought not do this because
(2:41:16) it's bad because blank okay wait wait wait hold on so you're saying you ought to be able to do mushrooms but still not
(2:41:22) do them no that's not what I said I thought that was what you said let me explain let me explain it again assume
(2:41:28) that nobody owned anything we're in [ __ ] socialism Utopia land okay there's no ownership of anybody you can
(2:41:35) just do whatever the [ __ ] you want that doesn't actually prove you own yourself because you can do mushrooms but if you
(2:41:42) say the reason you should be able to do mushrooms absent somebody coming in and
(2:41:47) telling you you can't right that's a different claim that's saying you ought not do that because you own yourself so
(2:41:55) you're actually conflating two different claims no no no I don't think I am so let's say you're in that socialist Utopia and someone hands a bunch of
(2:42:02) mushrooms out to everybody and you go I don't want to do these yeah that could
(2:42:07) easily be construed as you saying I own myself what if they go you're gon [ __ ] do them you're gonna [ __ ]
(2:42:13) whether you like it or not I'm stuffing them down your mouth so you would be violating that person's right so now we
(2:42:20) have a second claim so so what what's happening is the reason you have a non sequitor here is because you claim if
(2:42:26) nobody owns anything then you can do whatever the [ __ ] you want but nobody disagrees that that is the case it's only if you are making an a you can only
(2:42:34) do X because you own yourself that's where we have a problem with the
(2:42:39) claim well no I'm say I'm not saying you can only do X because you own yourself I'm saying you should be able to do what
(2:42:45) you want to because oh really so then why can't I stuff the mushroom down your mouth because I because you don't own me
(2:42:53) right because you own yourself and that's the claim right so what I I still asking why ought I not stuff or make you
(2:43:00) do what I want no no no that's not what I was ever asking I was saying that the claim to say I don't want to do
(2:43:06) mushrooms is the same to claim I do it's it's a claim of now it's a different claim to say I'm
(2:43:13) gonna Force somebody else but it's not an A and so what we're getting into is was even saying that I
(2:43:20) just saying listen Okay let me say this Glenn thank you so much for the call
(2:43:25) really appreciate it I thanks Glen I'm I'm only cutting this off for this reason I believe the next caller will
(2:43:32) have a lot to say on this very specific question because I know him and I I know
(2:43:37) he's a big proponent of the non-aggression principle so Casmir go
(2:43:43) ahead Sir with your hello gentlemen Hi Cass it's nice to see you brother how are you doing I'm doing quite well thank
(2:43:50) you good I'll get right to the meat and potatoes uh first I heard the Caesar that mentioned I think Caesar got his
(2:43:57) due from Brutus I think Brutus gave Caesar his due okay sixer tyrannos yeah
(2:44:05) okay so I have some questions I have some questions for Dave uh Dave do you
(2:44:10) agree that uh uh if I want to build a home for myself I could use a tape
(2:44:16) measure know one of these right sure okay seems weird now wait
(2:44:25) that seems weird if I take this tape measure yeah I'll get it's it's a good point trust me and I measure a 2x4 and I
(2:44:34) know that a 2x4 is like eight foot long and then this bloody thing tells me oh
(2:44:39) no it's 12 foot but I know I measure it with other tools I know it's 8 foot long
(2:44:44) but this thing tells me no you know it ought be 12 foot would that be a good
(2:44:49) tape measure I I I don't even understand what
(2:44:54) you're saying I say that would be a bad tape measure the tape measure told you it ought to be if you knew that the the
(2:45:01) the the piece of wood you you had measured it by other means and you had seen that it was x x length but then you
(2:45:08) took a tape measure to it and you realized well wait the tape measure is telling me it's a differ L the tape
(2:45:14) measure would be bad right sure yeah yeah it would be like a useless one
(2:45:19) right okay yeah so do we need the tape measure to tell me how what ought be the
(2:45:25) length no right it should tell me what is the length yeah sure the description
(2:45:31) of reality okay um now now this is the um I think this the
(2:45:39) point I'm trying to make is that when we go into a legal system we also don't
(2:45:44) need to tell us what we ought to do with it it just tells us what is the crime in
(2:45:50) fact if my legal system were to tell me you ought to do this or you ought do that it would be like the tape measure
(2:45:55) telling me what the link should be I don't needed to think tell me what the link should be I need to tell me the
(2:46:00) reality is it a crime in reality descriptively or not is that not true
(2:46:06) it's a question to both no that's I mean listen I think I think that's a terrible point and I think that would even Andrew
(2:46:13) I think would have to admit that by his own standards of morality that would not be so if if the legal system were to
(2:46:20) tell you that it was a crime to get married and have kids or that it was a
(2:46:25) crime to not torture your own kid sure that I'm
(2:46:32) sure there'd be a an I would that you could go that like I don't care what it
(2:46:37) tells me is the situation that ought not be what I believe in so no I don't think
(2:46:44) that's a good point AG there's there's a there's an analogy breaker here this tape measure is not just arbitrary like
(2:46:52) these examples this is based on reality the 2x4 is actually 8 foot long this
(2:46:57) measures it you know I see the measurements and I can measure it by other tools because it's connected to
(2:47:03) reality this is not an arbitrary invention right this is an invention that is based on observing reality and
(2:47:10) measuring it so if a law let's ask it differently if there was a legal system
(2:47:15) that was based on objective reality meaning it was an objective legal system and what it gave you is a is a true or
(2:47:22) false result whether something is a crime would you want it to do anything else if you had that Holy Grail of
(2:47:30) law yeah again I think this is I think actually Andrew's initial point that he
(2:47:36) was arguing with me takes out what you're saying here is that yeah but you can't get from an is to an A so if if
(2:47:44) you're talking about I'm not trying to get to an a I'm saying that the a is bad when I'm talking about the system of law
(2:47:51) what the system of law is should tell me is what is a crime it shouldn't tell me oh don't perform the crime because X
(2:47:56) reason I don't care about that initially something else can tell me why I shouldn't perform a crime for example
(2:48:02) Christian ethics can tell me why I shouldn't be a criminal or I should just could be like a whim I don't want to be
(2:48:08) a criminal or some reason ethics okay so the law is you can't believe in
(2:48:15) Jesus well that law would not be objective would not be like well that's convenient
(2:48:21) but okay sure so but like no but the law is objectively that
(2:48:27) you're not allowed to believe in Jesus so this is I can measure it and that's
(2:48:33) what the law is that's an equivocation so when I talk about I I don't
(2:48:38) understand I'm I'm sorry maybe I'm missing your point so just ask me the question more more straightforward Dave
(2:48:44) what is a conflict what is a conflict yes
(2:48:49) okay two views that don't align with each other no in libertarian terms it means a contradictory action so there is
(2:48:57) sure there's a different way of saying that but sure well there's various equivocations like different meanings
(2:49:02) can be assigned to the same word but in libertarian terms this is the the assigned meaning which is a conflict is
(2:49:07) contradictory actions and from there you can build a system where um you define
(2:49:13) what is um what could be like a system of of resolving or avoiding conflicts
(2:49:18) and you come up with three possible options you could have either uh libertarian law or objective law which
(2:49:25) is you should avoid conflicts you could have a an answer that says the law of the Jungle you should not avoid
(2:49:32) conflicts or you can do whatever you want sure and it could be some mixed law which is what we're currently living under which is you know if it's one form
(2:49:39) of Taxation then it's theft if it's another form then it's not theft that's mix LA right now all of those um are
(2:49:45) reducible they reduce to something they reduce to either might mix right or they're reduced to um conflict avoidance
(2:49:53) so that is an objective standard if I can examine what you're doing and saying
(2:49:58) you're initiating conflict I can call you a criminal that's objectively true I don't care whether it should be or
(2:50:04) shouldn't be okay fair enough I got you it's just that contrary let's say you say well um what is the why is the true
(2:50:13) well because everything else resolves into just conflict I don't care what you call a conflict
(2:50:19) initiation right you can call it gentle caress or you can call it you know saay
(2:50:25) or you can call it whatever you want it still falls under a different category from non-aggression from not initiating
(2:50:32) conflicts so that is an objective tape measure of law that's the very
(2:50:38) Foundation now you're saying something um should or should have to wrap this quick you're gonna have to we a lot of
(2:50:45) time but you got to you got to make it quick I'll I'll R this quick quick I think this was the my main criticism of
(2:50:51) this debate uh this debate um is like asking uh should you know is the tape measure better than Christianity well in
(2:50:58) what sense if I want to build a home and I want to measure something that the tape measure is better than I don't know
(2:51:04) Christianity but it's really a nonsensical question Christianity is in different category from yeah I I kind of
(2:51:10) I I tend to agree with you on that I think that like um like there there's something about the morality of law and
(2:51:18) the question of what is right and wrong are in different categories so I do
(2:51:23) agree with you on that it's like moral for me to you know uh evict somebody who's starving to death um sorry legal
(2:51:31) right but it might be not moral According to some system yes I I agree with you on that and at the same time
(2:51:36) there's there's so many little like nuances of that every single day where
(2:51:42) it might be the the way that I just treated my wife this evening could be
(2:51:48) immoral or moral but it's totally outside the realm of what's legal or
(2:51:54) illegal yeah so I I agree with that okay all right Cass uh one last
(2:52:01) Point real quick then we gotta let you go sure I want shout out to Great contemporary libertarian jurists like
(2:52:06) liid Zulu Stefan kinsella and Lucas dominc and I hope that uh they listen
(2:52:12) perhaps hear this and join together in a podcast so you can you can actually observe contemporary libertarian jurists
(2:52:20) discuss questions of law uh possibly separate from questions of morality which are discussed quite often
(2:52:26) elsewhere thank you I appreciate it Cass have have a great have a great evening by the way and here Rob if you don't
