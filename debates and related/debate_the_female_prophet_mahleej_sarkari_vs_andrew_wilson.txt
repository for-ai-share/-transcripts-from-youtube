(1:18) Hey everybody Tonight we're debating women's rights and we are starting right now with Malicia's opening statement
(1:24) Thanks so much for being with us The floor is all yours Hello everyone Um my name is Mahalich
(1:31) I'm going to start uh giving a little introduction about myself I was born in Pakistan I live in Canada Ontario now
(1:38) for about 27 years Um so I have been a big um advocate for women's empowerment
(1:46) and stuff because I actually represented Pakistan I did Miss Pakistan and Miss Pakistan world and I traveled around and
(1:51) stuff So um today I'm bringing my arguments that um I find that Andrew
(1:57) wants a society uh create a society that is regressive patriarchal and against
(2:02) basically human values depending on uh where you draw those values from Uh my
(2:08) argument is also that he wants to create a religious society which is also against uh in in my views conflicts with
(2:15) human rights Now um I think feminism is good because it gives women freedom to
(2:20) live their uh lives on their own terms Uh to me is feminism is um I would say
(2:26) more of like an equity kind of equality Um so I just want to start with um
(2:33) bringing some stuff like you know um what were what was women's rights like
(2:39) before the first wave of feminism uh feminism started right so the before the first wave of feminism which began in
(2:45) the mid 19th century women's right varied widely depending on the time period places that they lived uh they
(2:51) were limited in property ownership uh married women typically had to um had no
(2:56) independent uh property rights under the legal uh doctrine A woman's legal identity was
(3:03) uh by her husband upon marriage Any property she bought into the marriage became his and she couldn't own managed
(3:10) property independently So also there was no control over their earnings Uh
(3:15) especially women that were married once had no legal rights to their own wages or income if they worked Their earnings
(3:22) often uh legally belonged to their husbands or whoever was like their male guardian Inheritance restrictions While
(3:29) unmarried women uh spinsters or widows might inherit some property their rights
(3:34) were often uh cretailed compared to male hairs In many cases property passed to male relatives rather than daughters or
(3:42) wives Uh they had no political rights no voting rights Women were almost universally excluded from voting holding
(3:48) public office political uh participation was seen as a male domain and women were
(3:54) considered unfit for such responsibilities They had no legal voice Uh they couldn't serve on juries testify
(4:01) in courts in many instances or participate in the creation of law enforcement Um education was restricted
(4:09) limited access to formal education Uh universities were only uh you know restricted for men Employment there was
(4:16) unemployment barriers Um marriage and family uh subordination in marriage
(4:22) Wives were legally and socially subordinated to their husbands They had little to no say in family decisions and
(4:29) obedience was expected Divorce was rare Custody rights In the rare case of
(4:34) separation of divorce women typically lost custody of their children as fathers were seen as legal guardians
(4:41) There was no reproductive rights uh social and culture status there was restriction on public role and um you
(4:48) know what like I can go on and on and on but um so but what I'm trying to say here uh and now if we compare to like
(4:56) going from there to now it's been like what over 100 years um women are doing a
(5:02) lot better um and my argument is women are sessically outperforming men in the 21st century women are now account for
(5:10) 50.7% of college educated degrees um single women own more property Um so I'm
(5:17) just trying to make an argument here that you know whether you call it feminism or whether you call it women's
(5:22) rights it has done better for us women Um so I don't know why men have a
(5:28) problem with it Thank you Thank you very much for that opening
(5:33) statement We're going to kick it over to Andrew for his opening as well In the meantime I want to let you know folks if it's your first time here at Modern Day
(5:39) Debate I'm your host Dr James Coons We are a fully neutral platform hosting debates on science religion and politics
(5:46) We hope you feel welcome no matter what walk of life you are from And don't forget to hit that subscribe button as
(5:51) we have many more debates coming up including at Debate Con 6 this fall
(5:58) which will feature of course Andrew Wilson in a juicy debate But we will
(6:04) kick it over to Andrew for his opening statement Thanks very much The floor is open Yeah I do appreciate everybody
(6:09) coming out this fine evening to witness this debate I appreciate my opponent coming out for this as well I'm glad
(6:15) that we can finally have debates like this They've been needed for a long time In this debate I would like to fully
(6:20) flesh out my position but I won't be able to because of time constraints Um I've been called many things by Western
(6:27) feminist a chauvinist misogynist woman hater Uh even my opponent alluded to that in her opening Uh this debate
(6:35) actually gives me an opportunity for my followers to utilize this to point in the future when such insane claims are
(6:42) made about me so people can see firsthand my views on rights and women's rights specifically and women's liberation I ask everybody to listen
(6:48) closely for a couple of hours and put away your preconceived notions of things like freedom autonomy and instead use
(6:56) your brain for reason and logical thinking outside of just slogans To
(7:01) start with I'm going to give some descriptive truths about the world that aren't very fun to think about and don't align with the empathy first mantra of
(7:08) modern feminists and so-called women's rights advocates The way the world actually runs when you reduce government function
(7:15) nation states tribes even down to the family level is that we are a bunch of large waring tribes who fight endlessly
(7:23) over resources It is a never- ending fight and it will never end Sometimes we
(7:28) c cooperate for the resources we want and gang up on tribes smaller than us and sometimes we c cooperate with
(7:34) smaller tribes to gang up on bigger ones Fundamentally this is what we are doing though Make no mistake about that That
(7:42) is the world In order to survive 4,000 years ago or 4 days ago this truth was
(7:47) exactly the same We find ourselves in an accepted people group and demographic and work cooperatively to defend and
(7:54) take resources We find endless justifications for this But in the end after every emotional appeal is made and
(8:01) every justification exhausted that is the world When we discuss rights or
(8:07) women's liberation or even men's liberation or men's rights it's important we understand contextually the way the world works to come up with good
(8:14) conclusions for how society should or even needs to be run Every perceived
(8:19) right comes with great cost which is why we should give rights out sparingly They
(8:25) have no tangible existence but are only concepts and we should be very sparing with them With the right to free speech
(8:32) for instance comes subversion as a side effect The right to a gun there's going to be mass homicide shootings No two
(8:38) ways about it With the right to remain silent the ability is there to literally get away with murder when coercive
(8:44) measures would have garnered a better outcome However these things will necessarily come with rights To have
(8:50) them is to give people a concept to exploit malicious compliance You could say they can be used as quickly against
(8:58) people whose job it is to secure them as they can to liberate people from those who want to take them away It's a
(9:04) double-edged sword A nation needs to be healthy not just economic prosperity but
(9:09) spiritual and cultural health as well An idea of belonging to something greater than you and an idea of tying together
(9:16) bloodlines with strangers through shared interest in the preservation of joint values you care about and would be
(9:21) willing to fight on behalf of that nation and people and die for that nation if need be to preserve that
(9:27) shared interest and bond you have with your countrymen You do this because you believe that the very things you fought
(9:33) and died for will live on through your self-sacrifice of service to your nation and country Women's liberation has
(9:40) turned the idea of such societies upside down The values and structures which most Americans were willing to die on
(9:46) behalf of are completely gone They've been totally eradicated Society itself is totally inverted Since firstwave
(9:53) feminism and the push towards sexual revolution then later the sexual revolution of the 60s patriarchal
(9:58) systems have been sumearily dismantled by women's liberation advocates and western society has pretty much been
(10:04) destroyed by the female vote If we are to look at the anti-suffrage arguments they read more like a series of
(10:10) prophecies than they do arguments Let's go over them One anti-suffragists argued
(10:15) that voting and participation in government should be seen as a duty and not as a privilege As we have seen
(10:20) women's participation in the processes of civil rights almost everything is now seen as a privilege instead of a duty
(10:26) Entire institutions are devoted to brainwashing the masses into the very idea that with the great duty of civil
(10:32) service and political infranchisement those infranchised are privileged over those who are not instead of the entire
(10:38) process being viewed as a serious duty which should be taken seriously Two they
(10:43) argued women didn't need to assume this duty as it wouldn't address any problems which they actually faced This also
(10:50) turned out to be completely correct Feminism did not fulfill its promise and cannot fulfill its promise and neither can women's liberation because they
(10:56) necessarily always have to appeal to the enforcement class which is men The anti-suffragettes pointed this out Quote
(11:04) "The basis of government," they said is physical force It isn't law but law
(11:09) enforcement which protects society and women cannot enforce laws even if they make them That is still true to this day
(11:16) This is an extremely pivotal argument from the anti-suffragettes because it creates a class system where women can
(11:22) make laws that then women themselves have no expectation to enforce They can vote for wars that they themselves don't
(11:29) have to go fight to create workplace standards for women which men will have to enforce on their behalf They can
(11:36) create standards for society that they themselves have no ep mechanism absent men to actually do anything about Three
(11:44) that women would lose their moral position in society if seen as a voting block to be appealed to That's exactly
(11:50) what happened Women before the idea of women rights had moral NGO non-government organizations Lobbying
(11:57) groups highly effective in passing legislation on behalf of women's issues One such was the 18th amendment which as
(12:02) you might know was passed before the 19th amendment which gave the women the right to vote The 18th amendment as you
(12:08) might know was the uh outlaw of alcohol in the United States that was passed primarily by women's advocacy groups
(12:17) Four the anti-suffragette argued that quote "Women can own property and cannot
(12:23) become impoverished by debt Indeed the laws used for the state that the husband had to provide for their wives via the
(12:29) power of the law itself and their families." Meaning yeah maybe women didn't uh have property even though they
(12:36) did Um even under coachure laws there was preassessed agreements where they had property negotiated by their fathers
(12:42) on their behalf They also couldn't incur debt though no debt and men had a financial obligation to support their
(12:49) family or they went to jail They have no such no such laws on the books Now you
(12:54) can just abandon your family you don't go to jail Five anti-suffragettes argued that with this increase burden put on
(13:01) women that this would erode the family unit They argued it would divide household against themselves Married
(13:08) people divided over politics and families divided men and women over political concerns That it would divide
(13:14) the nation itself eventually as women will want to rule through empathy And that is exactly what has occurred Whole
(13:19) families divided by politics Households divided by politics Instead of a single
(13:25) household vote now there's two people who could be pitted against each other in the home Women have been the key
(13:31) decisive vote for all leftist power institutions in the United States Social decay caused by things like the
(13:36) destruction of the family unit and the rise of propaganda towards alternative family values has caused the West to
(13:42) literally implode Birth rates aren't sustainable anywhere in the West Nowhere
(13:47) They are uh inconsistent freef fall and will continue to be In itsstead women
(13:53) vote for things which cause further national disaster LGBTQ marriage trans issues children transitioning abortion
(14:00) removal of conscription so they don't have to be conscripted for the sake of equality mass migration policies women
(14:06) are the deciding vote on all of these things Not only that but the very idea
(14:11) of duties for women to the family having a family or moving society towards the propagation of family are soundly
(14:17) resisted at the women's institutional level huge welfare states nanny states they
(14:23) voted in western countries they vote in hate speech laws they vote in tone policing laws they vote for prostitution
(14:30) they vote for smut they vote for Only Fans to be legal they're the deciding vote on all of these issues If it were
(14:37) the case that women didn't participate in the political system and instead were revered and protected as young women and
(14:43) respected as older matrons how would that system be worse what things are they losing they would
(14:51) still have rights They would still have female privilege They did before there was uh a vote Before they had the vote
(14:57) they had rights And we would still have a strong nation which wasn't totally subverted by the feminine call for
(15:03) empathy on all issues My opponent hilariously enough is a demonizer of
(15:08) Islam I can respect that because they do worship a demon But her ideas for
(15:14) women's liberation come from her view of a demonic religion Once uh the West
(15:21) would be this by the way is a religion the West would be quick to dispel if women weren't at the forefront demanding
(15:28) hordes of Islamic immigrants be allowed into various Western nations in order to appease some stupid ass idea of fairness
(15:35) and equality This is battleground earth Islam has stated the womb is their
(15:41) weapon They see the declining Western birth rates and rub their hands in glee
(15:47) In a hundred years they may be in a position to put every Christian and Jew to the sword and they probably will
(15:53) Meanwhile we worry about tone policing abortions uh and how to pay for women's
(15:58) outsource to care or pay for women to outsource the care of their own children
(16:03) to strangers while they go to work It's the most backwards stupid [ __ ] system
(16:08) I've ever heard of It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard With that I'm happy to get into this I can't put most
(16:15) everything in an opening but this is a reasoned position It's a viable position and I'm tired of people pretending that
(16:21) it isn't It's not a regressive society as she says Her progressive society has
(16:27) led to nothing but degeneracy and a deciding vote on the most horrible things you can think of These women
(16:33) women can vote right this second to send you at 18 years old to stab another man
(16:38) in the face with a bayonet and they never have to be uh conscripted to go do the same thing Uh she says "Oh well what
(16:46) about property and the uh you know women women not being able to own property?" Well for one thing most people didn't
(16:51) own property in early American history or in early history of any nation in the but by the early 1800s you can look it
(16:58) up yourself By 1839 they could own property It's ridiculous We'd only been
(17:03) a constitutional republic for a few years She's upset um about about these
(17:10) issues but look how bad society looks under this It's pretty awful Wives were expected to be obedient Oh my god I
(17:17) can't They were Oh they Wow That's in that That's crazy Come up to the 10
(17:22) minute mark I'm I'm right there I'm right at the end You would you just humor me with 30 more seconds i'm right at the end of this Molly good You got to
(17:31) put 30 seconds I'm almost done Okay Same thing when she says "Well men got the
(17:36) custody of their children." Well look at modern stats Men do way better when they're the primary custodian of the
(17:41) child Almost every metric uh children do better when the single they have a
(17:47) single father rather than a single mother It's almost like they knew what they were doing She says women are
(17:52) outperforming men They're not outperforming men Yeah they get more college degrees That's true But they
(17:58) getting them in STEM They've been regressing from STEM It's been stagnated for the last 10 years and in many
(18:03) nations it's regressing the opposite way They get it in health care nursing and
(18:08) psychology Run through that last 30 seconds I'm good I'm good We will kick it into the open dialogue folks Want to
(18:14) let you know if you happen to have a question you can submit it two ways Either via the live chat if you tag me
(18:20) with modern day debate or if you use the super chat that will push your question to the top of the list for the Q&A
(18:26) section at the end But for now we're going to jump into the open dialogue Thank you very much We are ready for you
(18:33) Malish and Andrew So um yeah No there was a lot of things up here but I'm
(18:38) going to start by saying that he was so his whole argument was like "Oh my god this woman opened up by calling me these
(18:44) names and here he is." Because I'm a woman's rights activist I didn't even call myself feminism because calling
(18:50) yourself feminist You did call yourself a feminist So taboo Now you did call yourself a feminist though No no no I
(18:57) call myself I've always called myself women's right activist Okay Secondly you said I believe in feminism That was your
(19:03) quote You literally said I believe in feminism That the women's right activism came kind of from feminis feminism but
(19:09) it's just there are certain things I wouldn't agree with The new wave or you can call it but whatever Anyhow what I'm
(19:15) trying to say the system that you want to bring here I've already lived it right so I already lived it
(19:23) Great What system wait wait I'm sorry I'm sorry Stop Stop Stop What system am I advocating that you've lived am I Am I
(19:30) advocating that women be in burkas am I advocating that women have to go to church three times a day you want them
(19:37) to stay at home submit to their husband what does Islam say oh my god that's terrible That's terrible Is that your is
(19:44) your criticism of Islam that women have to respect their men tell me what submit means What does submit means
(19:52) uh submission It means that it means basically obedience Obedience to your husband Why why am I who who do you have
(20:02) to obey like I I can understand disciplining my child because it's like you know it's a child You have to obey
(20:07) your child Develop Why do I have to obey a a man just because he's a man like I'm
(20:14) an adult You don't you don't have to get You don't You don't have to get married Yeah You don't have to get married You
(20:20) And here's the thing If you don't want to obey a man don't get married That's fine Who's telling you who's telling you
(20:26) to get married nobody's telling you to get married But who said we want to get married like you guys are the ones that
(20:32) think that we want to get married That's because every poll we have shows that women especially in their 30s and 40s
(20:38) really want to get married Who you Who what from you look it up on you
(20:44) can look it up on Pew Research right now What do you mean pakistan It was a there was a study that was done that there's
(20:51) so many women I think there's about like 35 to 45% of women that are over the age of 35 that are not married Even in a
(20:58) regressive Islamic society women are saying no we don't want to get married and submit to a husband with no divorce
(21:05) and tie up to the kids Nobody said "Okay do you understand do you understand that
(21:11) when you say that I'm taking some Islamic position on society that you're strawmaning my position?" Stop that
(21:17) you're strawmaning my position on society That's not what I said And I knew that you would do the whole ah he
(21:22) wants to be like the Taliban It's like that's such it's such a straw man [ __ ] argument I just gave you good
(21:29) empirical evidence and data showing that how women and them having the right to vote has led to societal decadence and
(21:36) desecation and corrosion And I'll give you okay let me ask you right now
(21:42) blaming women for everything Oh the transgender Oh this problem that problem Are there men in the politics what about
(21:49) the I'm sorry Which which And which gender overwhelmingly votes for it which which gender overwhelmingly votes
(21:55) Democrat man or woman i don't care Men or women isn't it yeah Can you answer my question please can
(22:01) you answer my question please can you answer my question please women even if it is women what about the men why What
(22:07) about them what about the men though and I will tell you why Okay I will tell you
(22:13) why more women are going to vote for conservative because your religion is a
(22:18) part of the whole conservative thing and religion doesn't give doesn't matter your religion doesn't matter Islam
(22:24) doesn't matter any freaking religion especially the Abrahamic religions give no rights to women that's why we don't
(22:30) have religion and state till we had religion in the state women had no right that's why Pakistan has no right because
(22:38) they cannot separate religion and state this is exactly I've lived what you want to go back No you haven't lived what I
(22:44) want to go back to Early listen the early United States was nothing like modern Pakistan You're lying through
(22:51) your teeth All right we we do have Would you stop yeah Would you stop spuring femoid and just listen for two seconds
(22:57) andrew hold on I do have to just restore a little bit of order and we'll break it into 30 I think 30 seconds or so
(23:05) So 30 seconds back and forth for each of you to make your points or ask your questions
(23:11) Malish the floor is yours for 30 seconds I've got the timer set Okay My whole
(23:16) point is that whatever you're saying and you want to go back to women being at home women being the duty uh submitting
(23:23) all this women not having any right to property no right to anything We have countries like this and I know how women
(23:29) feel up there You know my whole point is it doesn't matter what religion you're coming from and you're a conservative and you and you bring God and everything
(23:36) into it automatically my rights my rights are taken right away You can't you can't compare gun rights to me I'm a
(23:43) human being I before I'm a woman you men have to understand that I'm a human being If you're allowed to vote why am I
(23:50) not allowed to vote just why why because you have a privilege because you're born with certain uh genitalia Thank you That
(23:56) was 30 seconds We'll kick it over to Andrew Okay so again uh early America
(24:01) didn't look anything like modern Islamic Pakistan You liar You're lying through your teeth Look nothing like it That's
(24:08) one Women would weren't required to have burkas They weren't required to uh go drag their feet at church three times a
(24:14) day They weren't required to be accompanied by a man when they walked down the road That is completely false
(24:19) All of that is false That's one The second thing is when you dive into this all we have to do is look at the
(24:25) outcomes They've been pretty terrible You say "Why is it that men should have the right to vote and not women?" First of all rights are fictitious They don't
(24:31) exist absent your mind The only rights you have are the ones men give you anyway You know how I know that cuz I
(24:37) can point at your country of Pakistan and if they say you ain't got no rights lady you can't do [ __ ] about it Can you
(24:43) do anything about it can Pakistani women do [ __ ] about it except appeal to other
(24:48) men can I ask the question James i got to ask the question Can Pakistani women
(24:54) Can Pakistani women go appeal to anybody other than men for their rights in Pakistan
(25:01) no The floor is yours And that's exactly what my point is The monopoly has always been there It's always been the control
(25:08) And the only thing men can get on us is the physical control That's all we need
(25:14) See don't interrupt me It's because they're interruptedly stronger than us So that's
(25:19) how they're going to control us right but then again I'm going to have to ask you like is that moral because you're
(25:26) you know the man of God Is that moral what they're doing to women of their is it moral for them to be doing that for
(25:31) their religion it is But is it moral for you okay And then you went back like 100 years ago Wasn't it 100 years ago we
(25:38) were burning women here as witches No we weren't You're lying again We were
(25:43) burning women as witches up here They did not have rights They did not have property Seconds Thank you And please
(25:51) don't interrupt me when I'm talking Yeah No 100 years ago lady We were not burning women as witches I don't know
(25:57) how long do you think a 100 years ago was a 100 years ago it was 1925 right do you think we were burning
(26:04) women as witches in 1925 you ignoramus On top of that as we decode all of your
(26:11) crazy ass nonsense you say women have some ought to vote What is that ought
(26:16) there is no ought there You just say if you can we should be able to That's not a reason though Just saying we should
(26:23) because I want to is not a reason If women generally make terrible decisions in the voting booth on behalf of society
(26:30) you tell me why I should let you vote if we have the power to to make it so you can't
(26:37) Well you know what i do agree with you We do make terrible decisions All these alpha men I don't know how
(26:43) their mothers made the decision to have them I swear to God that was a terrible decision to have them because now we have to sit here and listen to them what
(26:50) is good for us and what is not like I'm going to repeat myself in Pakistan and there is women up there The women's
(26:56) right has increased It has gotten a lot better than it was before Same thing with your religion You guys reformed
(27:02) Okay maybe it wasn't 100 But back in the days you were burning women as like don't lie to me that you didn't burn as
(27:08) witches right you're talking about Europe that h that was a European thing
(27:14) Good lord No Oh hold on one sec Malich
(27:19) you're on mute Let me if you're able to you still got we'll give you about 10 seconds to wrap up your question Malich
(27:26) if you wanted to ask No I just want to know what society if
(27:31) we were to start now What society is good for you what should women do just to please you men so you men think the
(27:39) society will work better what is your utopia thank you Yeah So it's not a utopia No one's saying it's a utopia
(27:45) What we're asking for here is some type of limit on voting That makes sense It wouldn't just be against women Also men
(27:52) at the founding of our nation couldn't vote equally with other men because they didn't have stake in the system There's
(27:58) no good reason to give everybody stake in the system It's an absurd position On top of that when you're talking about witches getting burned you conveniently
(28:05) omit that male witches also got burned This was not a gendered thing If you were a witch you got burned Male or
(28:12) female you omit that too You thought it was in 1925 cuz you don't know what the hell you're talking about
(28:18) Also all right what we can do is we can do a we can bump these up to one minute because I knew 30 30 seconds is really
(28:25) brief So uh if I remember right we started with you Malich So this is the first one where we'll do 60 seconds
(28:31) Malich go ahead Listen I don't care if it was 100 years ago it was 200 years ago whatever as
(28:38) human being we've seen for for for like thousands like hundreds of years at least like I can speak for my religion
(28:46) okay which came out of your religion Christianity okay the Abrahamic religion since they started it's copied after the
(28:52) other okay so I'm I only can stick to let's say Islam at least for 1400 years
(28:57) women have not have had rights this is the first time in 100 years that we're getting some sort of right you're
(29:03) talking about voting why shouldn't I vote why should I not when I am a participant I own a freaking property I
(29:10) need to know what is happening in this community I I pay as much money And then you brought up debt If it's so bad for
(29:16) you why is it like why why do you think I am not happy having debt like the whole concept I don't understand how you
(29:23) can make decisions for me saying that this is not good for me Debt is not good for me You know going to school is not
(29:30) good for me The only thing good for me is finding a husband and having babies and time Yeah So we're looking at societal
(29:37) prescriptions here at the whole society not at your narcissistic view of what you selfishly want No nobody gives a
(29:44) [ __ ] what you selfishly want We're looking at the societal view of what's actually good which is what I put in my
(29:49) entire opening statement So if we're talking about ought why ought we do a thing we can look at the results of the
(29:55) thing and see if we ought do it or not do it Here's the results of women voting The results of women voting are no fault
(30:00) divorce The the result of which is the divorce rate is skyhigh It's through the
(30:06) roof We're not reproducing in our nations You vote for degeneracy overwhelmingly That's plenty of reasons
(30:12) why we ought not let women vote Can you give me the ought for why women should vote please give me the actual ought
(30:19) other than cuz I really want to Cuz aha Shira if I'm empowered hear me roar Can
(30:25) you give me a single for why women ought be able to vote
(30:32) well I'll have to agree with you one on one thing I will agree with you White women are stupid to be honest Okay even I say that cuz they they're arguing with
(30:39) me about Islam And I'm just like do you even know so I will agree with you But again don't generalize women all around
(30:46) the world because there is women like I will agree with you on few things I will agree with you on few things But the thing is that divorce rate that you're
(30:52) saying is high up No fault divorce You know what we have to have you think that
(30:57) people are going to just like be together again for like 30 something years like it was back in the days No
(31:03) this is not the world we're living in We're online Things don't freaking work out People I I think people are rushing
(31:09) into getting married Each other Hang on hang on They meet each other for like six months and then they're getting
(31:14) married No you and then of course the divorces are going to happen Divorces are also happening more because now we
(31:20) have the option to divorce Before we didn't have the option to divorce right that's what you were saying No we did We did Yes you did How did how did we have
(31:26) Okay It again like in even in Islam we have the option to divorce But it is so
(31:32) difficult It is frowned upon and even in a society divorce woman is frowned upon
(31:38) So she didn't act notice she didn't actually give me an answer to my question which I asked her is why ought women vote I have an actual a why they
(31:44) probably shouldn't and why most men probably shouldn't hang on lady calm down lady She never actually gave me she
(31:51) never actually gave me an answer to my a claim I gave her a really good descript because the results are really bad That's why you ought not do it Why
(31:58) should you she didn't answer the question She doesn't know She just really wants to Ultimately though if I
(32:03) could provide you with a societal example which is better if you don't vote you should probably go for that That makes way more sense That's logical
(32:09) That's reasonable What's illogical irre and not reasonable is for you to say I freaking heart voting and that's why
(32:16) Give me again I'll ask you give me the reason why if women voting leads to
(32:21) these terrible outcomes for people why is it we should let them vote tell me why
(32:27) It's only to me it sounds like it's only leading to terrible outcome for men
(32:33) because men are scared that you know oh my god divorce rate is going up we don't have a problem with it women don't have
(32:38) a problem with it and then you're also scared about the reproductive question hang on the reproduction has gone down
(32:45) everywhere women are getting more educated the reproduction is going down we don't have a problem with it you guys are the one that have a problem with it
(32:51) the voting everyone should have a right to vote I don't care if you're why Why why should they why part of the society
(32:58) and you should haveistual and that's how we make societies No we make societies from
(33:05) individual and take those opinion If you don't like it you men can vote against
(33:10) it right you have also that No we have other options We can just take the right We can just take the right Well you see
(33:16) you keep interrupting me You don't let me finish You have that right That's why you have this manosphere where you sit
(33:21) here and talk and talk and talk and try to shame women into all that But I'm just saying that what what you're doing
(33:27) and shaming women into it saying "Oh my god this society is dooming." is not going to help because literally women
(33:34) are not women don't care now Even in regressive countries women don't care anymore But that's I'm willing to go
(33:41) into open dialogue One thing hold on one sec I'm willing to go into open dialogue where we don't have to add the 60-second
(33:47) things And that's actually what I was hoping to just let it move into without me mentioning it So we'll do that now
(33:53) and see how well it can go Yeah So this my whole point my whole point is that women don't care That's right You can't
(33:59) give me duties that women have just things they're entitled to Not duties that they have things they're entitled
(34:05) to So the thing is just like if if men can necessarily see this as a bad outcome on society and they have force
(34:12) doctrine on their side you do realize that that eventually will probably lead to men just stepping in and taking it
(34:19) from you right like you you get do you understand that men are capable of doing that women are not capable of doing it
(34:25) back because of that Yeah Because of that So you're always appealing to men
(34:31) You're always appealing to men to enforce these rights that you so desperately want And if you say "Well women just don't care They just don't
(34:37) care about men's interests We just don't care You're just useless useless cogs
(34:42) which are disposable right?" What do you think how do you think the reaction is going to be when you take the strong
(34:49) primate and you tell the strong primate uh no you know we're just uh we're going to do things which are against your
(34:54) interest in the interest of society It moves towards authoritarianism Your view actually moves towards the very thing
(35:00) you don't want See the thing is your your interest your men's interest uh it conflicts with my human rights right
(35:07) like the the fact that I can't vote I shouldn't own a property because if I own a property I should have a right to
(35:13) vote as a woman or as a man because I'm contributing into that society If you want to go back into like where women
(35:19) are forced to stay home and be uh you know taking care of their kids and all that I I think that again the only way
(35:27) men can control women is by force But wait that that's not even a good
(35:32) argument Listen that's not a good argument Hang on Hang on Relax Relax
(35:37) That's not actually a good argument If your argument if you had started an argument with me by saying "Andrew I
(35:42) think we should go back to property owners being able to vote men and women." I think that that's I think that
(35:48) that's a fine argument but that's not your actual position You just said "I deserve to be able to vote because I own
(35:54) property right?" Okay But that's not what you said What you actually said is everybody deserves the right to vote because they [ __ ] exist But I don't
(36:01) No no no We don't let all sorts of people vote because the outcomes are bad Tell you why I'm going to tell you why
(36:07) everyone should vote Because it doesn't matter who you are You're still living in the society You're still contributing
(36:14) to the society You're still shopping You're still traveling How come you cannot no How come you Most people are
(36:20) net drain on society i do want to give I do want to give Malach because they take more from the system than they give to
(36:26) the system Do you understand that Malach one thing is if you ask a question so like if you're trying to explain
(36:31) something and then you ask him a question then I I kind of have to let him talk So if did you feel like you finished your point there no No But what
(36:38) I'm saying to you I'm talking to Malish
(36:43) My whole point here I am saying that as a society if we're going to create a
(36:49) society and we're going to call it freedom for everybody equality for everybody which I think is how we can as
(36:56) much I I know that it everything cannot be equal Okay Something someone's going to get some But how can you say that
(37:02) even if that person is sucking in for from the system it is still part of the system Their opinion still matters
(37:08) whether it is right or not there No I don't believe all opinions Somebody is not contributing to the system I'm going
(37:14) to answer your question I'll answer your question It's very clear to me that you should not have 18year-olds nullifying
(37:20) the vote of 40 year olds who've been participating in the system uh for for twice the amount of years that they've
(37:26) been alive that they are so politically stupid and they don't understand what's going on in the political process that
(37:32) they can be used as cogs by non-governmental organizations which bribe them We see this day in and day
(37:38) out That is not a good system lady And you want why do you want 18-year-olds to vote against well-informed 40year-olds
(37:44) and cancel their vote that's dumb We we should never have a system like that And when you look all we have to do is look
(37:50) at the outcomes of who could be bribed by non-governmental organizations who sometimes uh give billions of dollars in
(37:57) kickbacks to politicians and book deals and things like this in assistance for them passing legislation that they want
(38:03) They bribe portions of the electorate to do this That's a terrible terrible system where we're never supposed to
(38:09) have mandatory participation in voting Our founders would be rolling over in their graves if they heard that
(38:14) everybody could vote That was never the way the system was set up Okay So so I do agree with you Maybe we can raise the
(38:20) age I think we should be able to raise the age once you are out of the college and you're actually contributing into
(38:26) the society You've uh you know you've got a job and stuff Okay I can agree with you Oh great So we can limit voting
(38:31) That's good stuff Don't interrupt Don't interrupt because I'm like trying to you know Yeah that's a good step to your point Uhhuh So you know I can agree with
(38:38) that because like you're too young at 18 I didn't I don't even know like I didn't even know about anything about politics like in 18 at that time I was I am not
(38:44) surprised Well no no no It's not that Don't be surprised It's just because that was not
(38:50) in my face all the time with social media We were living in different times You have to understand it was the whole
(38:56) I went to school here I can tell you that in high school there was none of this propaganda about transgenders and
(39:02) all this political [ __ ] It was not here I know I agree with you There's women driving it by the way Right Sorry Women
(39:08) are driving it No there's men also too Like so okay my question is there are some men I agree But women are the
(39:14) deciding Let me finish Women are being bribed Well how many times do I have to let you finish were there No but you
(39:20) said two points right you had your two points Okay go ahead Go ahead And then you said women are corrupt They are
(39:26) taking bribes My question is No no no That's not what I said Yeah you said they can be bribed all by the I said I
(39:33) was at that point I was talking about portions of the electorate can be bribed Like you have to untangle these concepts
(39:38) You understand what I'm saying before the women were even involved the men weren't being bribed all these in
(39:43) history we see the men are not traitors like what are you trying to say that's a human behavior you're going to have some
(39:49) women no bribery was necessarily limited by the voting pool so if you had a stakeholder in you're actually far less
(39:55) all men that I wish I wish I wish I could answer your question that you just asked me but anyway yeah bribery is
(40:01) necessarily limited because you can't you can't if you have a more limited voting block it's way harder for them to
(40:07) raid the treasury on behalf of a certain demographic and that's what divisive the divisive Can Can you calm down for two
(40:14) seconds that's That's the That's the whole game The whole game is being able to bribe voting blocks and they utilize
(40:20) NOS's and non-government organizations and and things like this in order to bribe those voting blocks You've already
(40:25) agreed with me that you want to limit suffrage You've already agreed with me You're like "Let's raise the voting age
(40:30) That's limiting suffrage You're an anti-suffragette lady You already want Hang on Hang on Stop Stop My turn My
(40:37) turn My turn Before you start spuring out Before you start spuring out Let's let me finish my point You're already an
(40:44) anti-suffragette So what you did was this You went "Hey based on my knowledge
(40:49) of the bad outcome of 18-year-olds voting we shouldn't let 18-year-olds vote." And I'm like "That's great You're
(40:55) using logic and reason So all we have to do is extrapolate that to other groups that make really poor voting decisions
(41:01) and then we could do the exact same thing because that's what smart people do That's how you that's how smart
(41:07) people operate They go "Wow you make really terrible decisions and you're making those decisions and outnumber me
(41:13) and we probably shouldn't have that because that's a terrible system You actually agree with me You start with
(41:18) step one You're right 18-year-olds shouldn't be able to vote Andrew Let's raise it to 25." And then you gave
(41:24) another qualifier Let's make sure they're contributing to society That's great Now we've eliminated tons of
(41:29) people from being able to vote because a lot of people I think it's actually most of the the underclass at least are
(41:36) non-contributors to uh to society at all as far as the services they get back from the government are far more than
(41:42) they put in So it's like I agree with you already We're limiting suffrage I think this is great This has been a
(41:47) productive conversation so far I just love it when people that follow Sky Daddy God call me talk about common
(41:54) sense and logic right so yeah No I agree with you that Oh yeah Follow Earth Daddy instead Follow Earth Daddy
(42:03) No I don't have to follow our daddy That's the whole problem You guys want us to follow daddy oh yeah Or whatever You got a daddy somewhere lady Let's
(42:09) give Molly Why all you men want to be our daddies online like we really don't want you to be our fathers Okay Yeah I'm
(42:16) not here to be your father I'm here to advocate for myself not to be your daddy Let's give Molly a chance to respond
(42:23) These men can't be father to their own kids and they're going to be Anyhow this is what Yeah you abort your kids Don't
(42:28) lecture me lady You kill your kids Let me start talking I Well don't Well don't
(42:34) make quips if you don't want quips back Don't talk about me being a bad father when you kill your kids Like stop It's
(42:39) embarrassing You're embarrassing yourself Where are you don't you abort your kids Don't you need to get this back on track Yeah you're an abortionist
(42:45) Get back to the actual We need to get back to the actual arguments So anyhow I'm going to go back to what
(42:52) he was talking about that oh my god the way like I told you when I like 20 years ago when I was studying here this whole
(42:59) propaganda wasn't up there The thing is you just only keep blaming women There's men in politics making rules too It's
(43:05) not only women making these rules There's men out there too Why don't you blame them no What part of I want for
(43:11) women voting for men did you not hear which part of that did you not hear yeah I can't hear It's because you talk so
(43:17) much you can't hear anything I've answered your question You just said you literally said when are you
(43:22) going to talk about men i put in my opening that men should be limited in voting Sir what do you not get about
(43:28) that sir let me finish I know you don't like women talking to you because oh my god I better submit You're not talking
(43:35) You're just shilly screaming to a man But please let me let me please Okay Okay I get whatever he was saying now
(43:42) that I forgotten what he was talking about He was talking about the voting thing Yes because all you see is
(43:48) propaganda on in the whole school system especially in US So I would agree with
(43:53) you Yes You know if you can't um contribute if you're not contributing towards the society you're not working
(43:59) you're not out of the school whatever you should be You see this is a Yes Yes Yes lady We
(44:08) got there Yes we got there I agree with you We'll break it back into 60 seconds
(44:13) Can I talk cuz I I I don't do this right like this is like the we'll give you 60 seconds ma lech and then we'll give
(44:20) Andrew 60 seconds I'm going to go back to the same thing I'm going to go back to women voting I think it's important
(44:26) to women to have their voice You want to take their voice away I can agree with you to a certain extent because see the
(44:33) thing I see with the society is it's not going to work me calling you names or you calling women names and taking their
(44:39) rights away It's not We're going to have to work together That means we're going to have to compromise somewhere But the
(44:44) whole fact that you sit there and calling women names and calling me a baby killer baby killer I actually had
(44:50) an option to have an abortion or keep a child And I kept the child But if I didn't then I had an abortion Same You
(44:58) will sit there and call me a baby killer But now that I have the child now I'm a single mom So either way I'm [ __ ] It
(45:04) doesn't matter In his eyes doesn't matter So that's the whole thing why we don't care Why women don't care We don't
(45:10) care about men like yours opinion because it doesn't matter what we do Men
(45:17) like you will never be happy because we always have to prove and submit and we got to be this and we got to be this and
(45:23) we got to be this where when they come to men doing all those things no they don't have to follow any of those rules
(45:29) So and that whole thing comes from the religion aspect of it Thank you That's
(45:34) funny because the religion aspect of it is what puts responsibility on men So for instance I do hold men to a really
(45:40) really high standard I think that men shouldn't be promiscuous just like I think women shouldn't be promiscuous I think men should be publicly shamed for
(45:47) promiscuity just like I think women should You said "I don't advocate for any type of limitation on men voting."
(45:52) Completely wrong You just made it up I literally put in my opening that they should there should be limits on men voting too You agree with me on the
(45:59) limiting of voting You would literally agree with me The very first thing you said it's like "Yeah you're right 18-year-olds shouldn't cancel out your
(46:05) vote When I was 18 I was a dumbass." you said Fair enough Right Totally agree with you So already you're moving into
(46:12) the idea Hang on Can I finish i didn't interrupt you Okay So anyway as we go
(46:18) through it here's what we see You agree with my points that we should limit the voting pool So you're an
(46:23) anti-suffragette already Right now we're just arguing degrees What degree do we limit it you think that people don't
(46:29) aren't a net gain into society you're literally cutting the vote down way quicker than I would I'm actually
(46:34) impressed with you I think that that's fantastic We should be moving towards that as quickly as we possibly can Also
(46:40) let me just point out yes I think that men who advocate for abortion are baby killers and women who do it are baby
(46:46) killers You're right I hold them both to an equal standard See how that works all right We'll kick it over to Malich 60
(46:52) seconds Well it's because I have common sense right i I I use logic I I might
(46:57) not have PhD or a doctor's degree or something but I use logic And when you
(47:02) logically explain that to me and I can see it yes as an 18-year-old I wasn't a dumbass You know I was doing a lot with
(47:08) my life That's why I am where I am as a 40-year-old So I wasn't just [ __ ] around But I'm just saying the whole
(47:15) fact when I hear things from you you know whether it is like with the the whole shaming thing I I totally agree
(47:22) with you If you're going to shame women well men should be shamed too You know it it's got to be equal in those departments I totally what my problem
(47:29) with you is that you think that all this is happening because women got their rights and because of women but I don't
(47:36) think it is only the women's fault that the society like this is failing but you
(47:41) guys just only blame feminism for it that that that's my problem like I I'll agree with you on certain things but you
(47:49) can't keep and the whole religious part like the whole obeying you the husband part I just can't get over it you can
(47:55) love your partner and And that love you can obey and do things for him I have
(48:00) done things for men that are you can call submissive you know just because I had that love for that partner But if
(48:07) somebody's going to demand that from me you're not going to get by demanding And you what you're doing is you got to
(48:12) you're demanding You're like no this is how it's got to be You got to be submitting to him You got to be at home
(48:17) raising kids You um you know and and your point the whole thing that you know women are better at home raising kids
(48:23) than being outside All right 60 seconds Let me give you the arguments here so that you understand the maybe I can
(48:29) appeal to you logically Again women are way better Why would you take the best
(48:34) and brightest like the smartest women that we have and waste them in a cubicle
(48:39) instead of having them raise the next generation of the best and brightest women and men why wouldn't you want them
(48:44) to do that why would you want to outsource their care that's [ __ ] stupid It's actually stupid to say that
(48:51) you want to outsource the care of your own children to complete strangers instead of you the person who has the
(48:57) biggest maternal bond with them raising them and advocating for society where that's possible The outcomes are not
(49:03) just based around we want women to submit to our authority right there's a necessary component there I agree But
(49:10) we're talking about what's in the best interest of future generations our children Right yes I'm sorry Women do
(49:16) have duties to their children to keep their families intact including with that those children's fathers Look at
(49:22) the outcomes of these homes where they run the fathers out or where the fathers aren't present It's a horrible result on
(49:28) the kids Horrible If you look at the black community for instance it's two out of three uh homes don't have a
(49:34) father Look at how terrible the results are in these in these homes Yes feminism I'm not saying it's only women but
(49:40) feminism was the major driving component in the sexual revolution to the degradation of the family unit There's
(49:48) no way around that That was the advocation of feminism and early feminists That is what they advocated
(49:53) for I can give you their quotes
(49:58) Okay So uh again the whole thing about like you know women and single moms and
(50:03) stuff and I can I can see how it has escalated but there's a lot of factors to it You know you're talking about uh
(50:11) kids not having fathers and stuff I have I can tell you the opposite stories My my own story the the guy doesn't want to
(50:18) be involved in his in her life and I I'm not going to force him to right so there's a lot and I am actually part of
(50:24) a lot of single moms groups where a lot of these mens don't want to be involved in these kids' lives It's not that women
(50:30) are stopping them But you know what online we hear always oh I wanted to see my kid And the ones that do see them
(50:36) they see them once a week If you're saying that women haven't been doing duty actually women are doing double the
(50:42) duty now Women go outside they work and then they come back home and then they have the duty to those kids But men when
(50:49) they go to work they come back at home Sorry one second So they don't do all the same things like we got our
(50:56) rights we got whatever but men stopped they didn't change themselves that you know the physical labor and the whole
(51:04) responsibility of raising a child You guys don't take that responsibility Child we'll kick it over to these are
(51:09) all excellent arguments you're making against feminism and egalitarianism You're right The law used to make it
(51:15) mandatory that men had to had to take care of their children Had to They had
(51:20) to do it or they went hang on or they went to jail They had to take care of their wives or they went to jail That's
(51:26) what the law used to say they had to do Now they don't have to You don't have to take care of your wife now You just leave On top of that wives they're the
(51:33) ones who are doing the initiation of divorce And it's not for abuse The number one reason is irreconcilable
(51:38) differences He doesn't make me feel warm and fuzzy inside Which puts their children at a massive disadvantage in
(51:45) comparison to the rest of society Okay You do have to sacrifice your duties and interest on behalf of your children You
(51:51) say "Oh men don't help out with the housework." Well yeah if you're stay-at-home mom that's your job lady He does He does the work You do the
(51:57) housework Oh it's terrible And by the way it's a great deal for women to be stay-at-home moms They only have to do
(52:03) the early maternal years I have multiple children It gets way easier as they get older in that department And most of the
(52:10) time now you ship your kid off to public school by the time they're six So you don't even have them for eight hours out
(52:16) of the day Don't tell me how rough it is on women Give me a break 60 seconds Okay So like I say it's so easy Why don't men
(52:23) do it let's do it They do do it They do do it No no no no no no no There's more single mothers than there's single
(52:29) fathers Okay I By choice By choice Let me finish Well I want Let's give them all each for 60 seconds I literally know
(52:38) of women that have been divorced in my area in the last few years that I've lived here And let me tell you they're
(52:43) exhausted They're exhausted from working outside They're exhausted from taking care of the parent from the for the kids
(52:49) running them around here and literally they're tired That's why you you say like "Oh they didn't feel warm and fuzzy
(52:55) anymore." So you want the parents to be miserable not love each other but stay for the kids Do you think that is better
(53:02) for kids yeah it's not better for the kids That's not what the stats show I'll make you that argument Not what the
(53:08) stats show If the woman the mother is herself
(53:14) miserable in a relationship if she can't take care of herself how is she going to take care of the kids you guys are never
(53:20) there I have been in like literally you would rather have an abusive family
(53:25) these people screaming yelling and screaming at in front of kids that they
(53:30) think is better than separate houses Well then you have to then you got then
(53:36) Lucy you got some splaining to do because before we had no fault divorce most people stayed married and if women
(53:42) were truly these can you stop can you stop talking lady so if it is the case lady that women were in these miserable
(53:50) marriages and they just couldn't leave and that was actually worse for the kids how come those kids were so much better
(53:55) adjusted with way less mental illness and had way better prospects for their future than our children do right now in
(54:01) single mother households can you explain that why Is it that in single mother households the children have every
(54:06) single multiple disadvantage you could think of including mental illness homelessness everything else when in
(54:12) comparison we go back to uh before there was no fault divorce Women stayed married Th that generation of children
(54:18) far better adjusted way less mental illness way less homelessness way better nest eggs they have better advantages in
(54:24) every aspect So if it is the case that women were just miserable right and they shouldn't have stayed at just out of
(54:30) duty because that would affect the kids It seems to have affected them positively didn't it first of all all
(54:37) these terms that have come up with ADHD and everybody's got some kind of a you know some kind of order So that was
(54:43) because we didn't have all these orders at that time Now we do have them right so that's why you're seeing them because
(54:48) at that time those kids you you're comparing the you cannot go back to the old ages Andrew I know you want to go
(54:55) back into your childhood and then that but we are evolving We are always evolving as human being and as this
(55:01) isn't an argument Make an argument always No but I'm just telling you that this is how it works You are still
(55:07) sitting in the that area and then you like well back in the days it used to be like this Why didn't you have this why
(55:13) didn't you have this because of science Now science says that this and this is what happens while this person has ADHD
(55:19) right put them on some pills Why because pharmaceutical companies can make pills We can get into a whole other argument
(55:24) with that But you cannot say women did not have the right or it wasn't easy for
(55:30) them to get a divorce Oh so let me listen Let me get this right Hang on It's my turn now Hang on I can give you
(55:36) an example Please don't interrupt me I can give you an example right now But it's my turn to talk You're legally allowed to get give you a chance to wrap
(55:43) the Malich I know but he keeps interrupting me In Pakistan you have the right to divorce but it is so difficult
(55:50) for you and it is so frowned upon you know to go get a divorce It makes it harder for women to go actually get a
(55:57) divorce But even then women are getting divorces because even in Pakistan see so
(56:03) it doesn't work that way Andrew Yeah You see how you destroy your own argument you're like "Well Andrew what it is is
(56:08) the reason that the families who were intact even though the women couldn't get a divorce the reason that the children had better outcomes is because
(56:14) a bunch of pharmaceutical companies and psychologists weren't cramming ADHD meds down their throat We didn't have those
(56:20) type of psychosis at the time." Well who's who who are the psychologists lady women They're all women It's almost uh
(56:27) it's almost 100% women in that field It's completely oversaturated with women They're the ones who are inventing the
(56:34) borderline personality disorder narcissism They're the ones at the forefront of that Completely saturated
(56:41) with women in that department Not men women And by the way that still doesn't
(56:46) even contend with my argument They should have been just as mentally ill then as they are now They should have
(56:53) been but they weren't Why well because when we look at intact households right
(56:58) this second we see that the results for the children are fantastic even if the parents stay and they don't really like
(57:03) each other that much But we go back to when you didn't you had to show cause instead of no cause for divorce You saw
(57:09) the outcomes for the children were far better even if the women were miserable Contend with that argument Show me the
(57:15) flaw in that logic You know so back in the days I remember in our village there was a guy that he
(57:22) used to everyone thought that he had like these gins on him He he needed exorcism And then 20 years later now we
(57:30) can find out that you know he was bipolar or something else So that's exactly what happened Andrew We didn't
(57:36) have those things then Now we have those things right and then we also Why wouldn't you have happened then though
(57:42) please don't interrupt Okay Why wouldn't you have Let's give 43 seconds Yeah You keep you keep bringing your argument why
(57:49) those kids didn't have it and we have it It's the same thing We didn't know the signs of ADHD We didn't know the signs
(57:56) of autistics like we didn't know the science of a lot of things that we know the science now Okay And yes I do agree
(58:03) with you because to it's a pharmaceutical company They're just you know I I do find that they're just
(58:08) giving it to everybody Even though people do have legit problems but we didn't know that back then People had
(58:14) those same things but we just didn't know It's not like oh go oh my god it just So your argument again because
(58:20) you're a man of God you don't believe in science We're evolving Things are going to evolve Some things are going to work
(58:26) out some things are not going to work out So then you fix those things That's how society works Thank you Oh I see If
(58:31) you if you don't believe I see So if you if you believe in God you can't believe in science Um I'm an engineer by trade I
(58:38) don't know what you do but I definitely believe in science By the way let me just point this out What you're saying is irrational You say we now have the
(58:45) diagnostic tools in order to diagnose these mental illnesses Those mental illnesses still would have existed They
(58:52) just would have been undiagnosed Right if that's the case then we still should
(58:57) have seen all sorts of maladjustment inside of these households because the women were miserable And we don't we
(59:05) don't see that So your argument makes no sense It makes no sense There should have been just as many kids with ADHD
(59:11) then even if it's undiagnosed as there are right now But there weren't There
(59:16) weren't And what's so interesting is that when we look inside of these two parent households right the results for
(59:22) these children was extraordinarily better than they are right now And you would have to argue that at least a lot
(59:29) of those women were miserable because they couldn't leave those marriages Why were those kids so much better adjusted lady why
(59:36) i don't know adjusted to what you're talking about again and I'm going to go to your argument that you keep bringing that up that oh my god why didn't they
(59:43) do this if we didn't have DNA technology back then how could you find DNA that's
(59:49) what I'm saying it was if we didn't even invent what ADHD was at that time you
(59:55) could see the signs and like I gave you an example people thought somebody was getting a d on them they were doing exorcism on them because they could see
(1:00:01) it I literally agree with all of this you're not why don't you understand what I'm saying to No I do understand what you're saying
(1:00:08) Well you why why can't you understand what I'm trying to because it makes no sense Kids are different now And why
(1:00:13) these people that you see that people have ADHD we didn't Was there a thing as ADHD back in the day no of course not
(1:00:19) Was there no Right Why because we didn't have the linguistics
(1:00:24) uh or the psychological approach to to to diagnose it Right We didn't know that
(1:00:30) these certain characteristics in a person can be ADHD Even though totally
(1:00:36) makes sense Totally makes sense So they did actually have it It just wasn't diagnosed Right Hang on Hang on And back
(1:00:42) in the days we have no data We have better ways to collect data now You
(1:00:47) don't have the data to measure the happiness of women Nobody was going home to him asking women if they were happy
(1:00:53) Okay And to fact that you're saying all those people turned out okay Are you serious no I didn't say they No No No I
(1:01:00) didn't say I didn't say okay I said that their outcomes were far better the outcomes for for those children are far
(1:01:06) and away better for the outcomes of children in single mother households right now There's no doubt about that
(1:01:11) when you're and again you keep on saying you keep on saying we didn't have the tools to diagnose it I'm agreeing with
(1:01:19) you What part of this are you not getting i agree You didn't have to but that wouldn't make the mental illness not present because you can't diagnose
(1:01:26) it They would still have the mental illness You just couldn't diagnose it You would think they would be worse but
(1:01:32) they weren't worse Even if you had no diagnostics they still weren't doing worse So the thing is is like these two
(1:01:39) parent households we see this over and over and over again The outcomes for those children way better They did
(1:01:45) better academically They did better physically They did better in almost every aspect of life in comparison to
(1:01:53) modern uh children who are raised in single mother households There's no there's just no if ants or buts about it
(1:02:00) All data points to this All of it Okay So you were saying that those kids
(1:02:06) back in the days were better physically Okay Yeah I agree with you because there was no internet There was no social
(1:02:11) media Kids went outside They played They socialized It was a different time right
(1:02:17) that that's what you keep keep bringing it No you want it was a different time There was not as many people in the
(1:02:23) world It wasn't so multicultural right was it it was a different world where these are great arguments against
(1:02:29) feminism going to be different Hang on The outcomes are going to be different right nobody was glued to their TV all
(1:02:35) day long So obviously they were better physically fit right they went and played more sports so you could see
(1:02:41) better sportsmen coming out of there Nowadays you're seeing more gamers It's just different You're still seeing that
(1:02:47) talent but it's different It's you you don't No no no Because there wasn't that
(1:02:52) many people at that time either Like I I just don't understand how you keep comparing that time to now time because
(1:02:59) the situations were different You know the everything wasn't these are great arguments against multiculturalism
(1:03:05) They're so expensive You know both parents didn't have to go work outside right you could live in a home and one
(1:03:12) car in a decent The times have changed now It you cannot just say "Oh it's because single mom." This is great And
(1:03:19) again the single moms where are the fathers why are they like this is this is fantastic You're right It's almost
(1:03:26) like putting women in the work force right because rich industrialists wanted them to be in the workforce and they did
(1:03:32) and it was all funded by Rockefeller for instance who wanted them in the workforce in the worst way Okay Doubled
(1:03:39) the the now amount of labor industrial labor which was available thus decreasing and suppressing wages
(1:03:46) necessarily It was a terrible idea You're right they could afford one income because society was set up for
(1:03:51) that Women demanded the opposite and the outcome of that was really bad Not only that but let's take a look at your other
(1:03:58) arguments here which are absurd arguments If you would have a good leg to stand on if you said "Well wait a
(1:04:03) second It's a different time then and they didn't have A B C and D." Uh well okay but now we see in two parent
(1:04:09) households right this second in modernity the outcomes for children are still way better Even if they're in houses where the mom and daddy don't
(1:04:15) really like each other that much the outcomes for the kids are still better Why because they govern that stuff They govern the smartphone use They make them
(1:04:22) have more playtime They make demands that they watch less TV Single mothers aren't making those types of demands
(1:04:27) They don't have time to make those types of demands Clearly it's better to have a two parent household and keep those
(1:04:33) intact Feminism has been doing everything it can to destroy that and women's liberation And I I demonstrated
(1:04:40) it to you and you demonstrated it yourself by saying by giving the examples of society used to be way
(1:04:46) better Fair here Malich go ahead I think uh I think women uh need to have the
(1:04:53) right to have a divorce If they are not happy in a marriage they should have a right to divorce Uh the fact that you
(1:04:58) keep saying it and keep bringing it up I I would agree with you Yes I agree with you that a child needs both parents And
(1:05:05) uh again you keep saying single mothers single mothers single mothers I can list 100 names right now of single mothers
(1:05:12) who men are not involved They don't want to see the kids So you keep blaming the
(1:05:17) women where we are the ones trying First of all we didn't go and get an abortion because otherwise then we would be baby
(1:05:24) killers So now we chose to keep the kids right so that's also our responsibility Now we're single mothers and nobody
(1:05:30) wants us anymore And the men go and cry on the internet Oh we are restricting access to their kids No these men choose
(1:05:37) I have even seen men that will quit working so they don't have to pay child support Yes ma maybe single mothers do
(1:05:45) fall behind but they have a lot on their plate But I will tell you something else I know you're bringing these stats and
(1:05:50) stuff but what I see around me is totally different I have seen single mothers once they get out of the
(1:05:56) relationship they're better They're focusing on themselves They can focus better on their kids now Their life is
(1:06:01) more organized They're doing far more better when they were together in an unhappy relationship Thank you Yeah this
(1:06:07) is hilarious because we can look at multiple studies which have metaanalysis done on them right and so we can prove
(1:06:15) that the court system has been extraordinarily biased against men towards women when it comes to custody here in the United States We have all
(1:06:21) the support in the world to prove it We also know that women are initiating the divorces not men due to the unhappiness
(1:06:27) level right they're the initiators of these divorces not the men So yeah the men are like "Oh okay So you're going to
(1:06:33) take my kid hit me out of the blue with a divorce right and I'm supposed to pay child support Like screw that It's a raw
(1:06:39) deal So yeah men have legitimate concerns and gripes with this right when
(1:06:45) they get lamb blasted with things like this men are put in that position The court systems have been traditionally
(1:06:50) biased against them at least my entire adult life they have And in my father's adult life they were The second we went
(1:06:56) into no fault and the custody agreements were automatically defaulting to women We can see this time and time again Only
(1:07:02) through men's rights advocacy has this gotten better at all And right now what we can do is we can look at the data of
(1:07:07) single mother versus single father households and the single father households outperform them by every single metric Do you know why that is
(1:07:14) it's because abuse in the home happens to children mostly because of stepparents where women are bringing
(1:07:21) strange men around the kids and that's when the kids get didd and they get beat up and they get everything else That's
(1:07:26) on women That's on the women you understand this whole argument that oh it's because the single mothers are
(1:07:33) bringing men because otherwise kids were never getting molested in the houses Let's not even talk about the church in
(1:07:38) Pakistan Most of the kids let's talk about it in in hang on in uh double family homes you know who who is getting
(1:07:45) molested in Pakistan They're wearing burcas or covering everything The kids are getting molested at their house in
(1:07:50) their house Okay They some other steparent didn't have to come in Yeah I know it happens and women should be
(1:07:56) careful But the way you paint here that every single mother is here going on I've had one guy beat my daughter
(1:08:02) because I know what it takes to be in that situation right ever And that's the worst thing that can happen to your have
(1:08:09) like a your ch Did you say you had a guy beat your daughter no I said I've only
(1:08:15) have had one man meet my daughter but you will take care paint all single
(1:08:20) mothers that are bringing their you know stepparents in And again how is that
(1:08:26) woman's fault because she's trusting that man And of course you men are like this You will like be I can't even
(1:08:32) believe it Like you will come into a relationship with a woman and then try to go and do that to their kid because
(1:08:38) men are so evil right but again I'm going to go back to your point saying that if it is in a double household and
(1:08:45) stuff I agree to you a certain extent But at the same time I don't agree with uh sorry I don't even know what point I
(1:08:51) was making I just totally lost it up there Sorry Well let me respond very quickly to all these Can you repeat that
(1:08:57) yeah To all the Hang on Let me respond quickly to all these claims We'll start with with molestation in church You're right It does happen But you know where
(1:09:03) you know where it significantly happens way more public schools which is where you're sending your kids way more the
(1:09:08) it's 100 times more in fact 100 times more in public schools The public institutions are way worse than the
(1:09:13) churches So the thing is is like that point is moot You're not advocating we get rid of public schools because of that So not only that but let's hang on
(1:09:20) But not only that let's push in even even further when it comes to to stepparents Am I saying all steps are
(1:09:26) bad no I'm a step parent myself Okay am I saying that that's bad no I'm not saying it's evil What I'm saying is that
(1:09:32) if you really have concern for your children you'll do everything you can first to make your relationship work out
(1:09:38) on behalf of your child knowing that the stats and rates of bringing strange people around are going to be
(1:09:43) detrimental to your child That's terrible And this happens over and over again Women are choosing to be single
(1:09:49) moms The the father does not want to break it up The father does not want to break the family up They choose to be
(1:09:56) single moms by initiating these divorce procedures against the husband's will And they don't have to show any cause
(1:10:02) They're choosing it You can't choose it then complain about it Yeah No we are choosing it I have actually spoken to
(1:10:08) three women that just got separated here One was never married but they broke up They were together for like seven years Yeah Women are choosing because we're
(1:10:15) tired Like women have literally told me they're like "We're tired We can't do all this work." Uh you know you guys are
(1:10:22) not putting your own weight No you guys are not pulling your own weight That you're saying "We are choosing instead of being miserable We want to leave."
(1:10:28) And men don't want to leave Men don't want to leave Who wants to leave when all your [ __ ] is done for you who wants
(1:10:33) to leave and you have a maid who taking care of your kids she's cooking She's cleaning She's sleeping with you And you
(1:10:40) don't even have to pay anything Wow What a privilege She's sleeping with you Wow What a privilege The bills too Wow It's
(1:10:46) like heaven Haven't you seen that stats that single women are happier and married men are happy because all their
(1:10:53) chores are done for them because they got a maid Like this is exactly what it that's why women are like "We've had
(1:10:58) enough We'll do it ourselves ourselves If we have to do the same work we'll do it work And let me tell you one person
(1:11:05) work less is so much better Believe me we can focus more So you this is why
(1:11:11) women are leaving it there It is their choice I'm not arguing with you But you men you don't want to leave because
(1:11:17) you're so comfortable You don't want to do better So women just get up and leave They're like "Okay [ __ ] it." Oh I see
(1:11:23) Yeah So here's what's actually going on You're talking on both sides of your mouth again So on the one hand you say it's so hard for single moms out here Oh
(1:11:29) my god My turn over to Andrew for 60 seconds No So you speak out of both
(1:11:34) sides of your mouth Okay It's so hard to be a single mom Who would ever choose that condition it's so terrible And then
(1:11:40) on the other hand you're like I know women who are choosing that condition right now cuz they're just tired of men You're speaking out of both sides of
(1:11:45) your mouth Right So here's here's what's actually happening Men feel an obligation duty to keep their families
(1:11:51) intact Women do not in modernity feel an obligation to keep their family intact That's why they initiate these divorces
(1:11:57) Not only are they initiating these divorces but you by your own admission just said you know no less than three right now Who just did because they're
(1:12:03) just tired you know they just don't feel fulfilled What about the duty to the kid i don't know Screw the kid It's all
(1:12:08) about me It's all about mom It's all about how I feel It's like no you have children involved now You have a duty
(1:12:14) and obligation to keep your family together just like the men do who are not initiating these divorce You say it's because they're so comfortable No
(1:12:21) they're not They're working more than ever They're working more overtime than ever They're working their asses off non-stop And by the way the conditional
(1:12:28) if you think that single women are so much happier explain why they kill themselves more often than married women do if they're so [ __ ] happy
(1:12:35) Especially divorced women Especially divorced women try to off themselves more In fact this is one of the segments
(1:12:40) demographics most likely to do it We'll kick it over to Malish
(1:12:46) It's like we can say why are men that get divorced also commit suicide single men are also committing suicide It's
(1:12:52) miserable They're both They're both doing it right uh because it's miserable
(1:12:57) When I try to answer you you just distract me with these All right Right I'm not going to distract you Go ahead And uh so yeah no women are tired and
(1:13:04) men are comfortable They are comfortable That's that's that's exactly the reality of it Men are working So are women today
(1:13:11) Women are working It's true income household But when men come home they want their meals cooked They don't want
(1:13:16) to do anything at home So exactly this is how bad it is Even though women know
(1:13:22) life is going to be miserable probably really hard after they leave that guy
(1:13:27) but they still choose it because they're still happier than what they were in before So imagine how bad it is Imagine
(1:13:34) how bad it is You guys don't see your shortcoming You guys keep blaming things on us Women work 60 plus hours extra in
(1:13:43) just household labor running around with the kids and their chores and doing all those things And I'm not only talking
(1:13:49) about single moms I'm talking about mothers that have parents And if men wanted to keep families together we
(1:13:56) wouldn't have men cheating with multiple women All right no those men will go out
(1:14:01) Men do commit more adultery And you know that men are more likely to go cheat because they can't control themselves Of
(1:14:08) course in our religion in Islam you're legally allowed for wives Like seriously
(1:14:13) Yeah I'm not advocating on behalf of Islam That's one And I advocate on behalf of monogamy like Christians do
(1:14:19) Not only that but who are they cheating with they're cheating with women who are home wreckers They're like "What do you want me to say there?" Not only that but
(1:14:27) whi but men work more hours than that were married You know how many guys come to me they don't tell me they're married
(1:14:33) Yeah Stop clucking lady So men work more hours than women This is a statistical fact You can look it up yourself You can
(1:14:39) Google it right this second Men work way more hours than women do Not only that when you say "Oh but women in household
(1:14:45) chores actually do more." No they don't And again it gets way easier Most women
(1:14:51) pack their kids off to a public institution for 8 hours out of the day
(1:14:56) Who are you trying to fool here how dumb do you think we are you pack them up for 8 n 10 hours a day After school
(1:15:04) activities often will take up even more of their time You have to help them with a little bit of homework make sure they brush their teeth and go to bed It's a
(1:15:10) real rough life out there Meanwhile you have modern conveniences washing machines dishwashers How long do you
(1:15:16) think it it takes to load a dishwasher not very long How long do you think it takes to load the laundry not very long
(1:15:22) No household chores are not You're not overcoming men in their overtime work
(1:15:28) with household chores That's ridiculous And not only that it's not laborious As a famous comedian once said "Any job you
(1:15:35) can do in your [ __ ] pajamas can't be that hard." Time of course that if it's not that
(1:15:42) hard again I'm going to tell men to do it And there's a lot of women that keep
(1:15:48) telling men in their household it's not hard to put the dishes in the dishwasher
(1:15:53) It's a very small thing It's not hard to put clothes in the laundry machine Exactly Then why don't you do it you do
(1:16:01) it right but you don't And you're like "Oh it's so hard It's hard." Then then you do it If it's not you know if it
(1:16:08) isn't so easy you do it then And this you're wrong about it that women are not
(1:16:13) putting in extra hours Women in average families are working the same time I'm talking about the average people here
(1:16:19) that work there Men work the same hours So do the women Okay and men don't do even even taking care of the kids
(1:16:26) Disciplining kids is I see is more women's responsibility I literally used to babysit kids and I would complain to
(1:16:32) the men oh that is the mother's department Everything is a mother's department I see those mothers running
(1:16:39) around If you're going to do everything for your child and your home alone and your partner is only there and not even
(1:16:45) paying your bills you're better off alone Why why would you want to do that and this is exactly the mindset women
(1:16:51) are thinking with now Okay They're thinking with that that why am I going to do something extra for this person
(1:16:57) that doesn't even appreciate it It doesn't contribute anything So yeah you're not doing anything extra one
(1:17:04) you're wrong On the average women are not working more on average than men That's insanity There's no you can't
(1:17:10) there's no way to demonstrate it because it's just functionally untrue And you know why it's because of occupational differences It's literally because of
(1:17:16) occupational differences In the trades you're always probably going to work more hours than when you're in cubicles
(1:17:22) and in basic service work That's just the way that it usually operates That's why they're not going to be surpassing
(1:17:27) men in hours work anytime soon or ever Not only that you say "Why don't men do these things?" Men do these things
(1:17:33) constantly What are you talking about if you go to a single man's apartment most of the time it's cleaner than a single woman's apartment By the way they do
(1:17:40) dishes They do all of this stuff on behalf of themselves When they're married you have an appropriate splitting of duties If the man is
(1:17:46) working full-time of course she needs to load the dishes And of course she needs to take care of the household fairs
(1:17:52) That's her [ __ ] job Rough gig I know Terrible gig You have to get up at the
(1:17:57) crack of 10 Oh my god You have to get up at the crack of 10 and do household chores It's a rough life out there
(1:18:03) Meanwhile hubby's out the door at 4:00 in the morning and he's working until I don't know 6:00 at night half the time
(1:18:09) get bringing home overtime pay You on the other hand ship out the the kids to a public institution for most of your
(1:18:16) day And by the time they get home it's a couple hours before it's bedtime The most you really got to deal with them is on the weekends Just stop with the cope
(1:18:23) about how single moms have to put in so much work It's like just stop and you and you end up having to to speak out of
(1:18:29) both sides of your mouth anyway So on the one hand you say it's the hardest job ever right and then on the other hand you you have to then go and say
(1:18:36) "Well but the thing is is it's not really the hardest job." It's like you can't even make up your mind here Make
(1:18:41) up your mind Is it the hardest job ever isn't it i'm saying No no You're saying that it's
(1:18:49) not hard You keep saying it's not hard and I keep saying if it's not hard then you do it But what I was talking about
(1:18:54) was the unpaid labor not the paid labor Women work at least extra 40 to 60 hours
(1:18:59) And that's not talking about working at somewhere else No it's about doing your chores just managing and everything The
(1:19:07) whole Do you think the whole system is just working because men are doing that in majority women are the ones No women
(1:19:14) are the ones taking care of the household in majority of the time This whole thing that oh men are doing this
(1:19:20) No they're lacking behind a single man Yeah a single man Oh my god I used to rent out rooms and I
(1:19:28) would say 80% of the men were disgusting 10% of the men kept their house clean I
(1:19:34) had another room in a 70 yearear-old man He was so freaking disgusting Okay single men Cool anecdote bro I'm talking
(1:19:41) about men that are in a relationship in a marriage they're not contributing That's why you see women complaining If
(1:19:47) they were if they were doing it why would we be complaining please tell me if they were doing it And we're
(1:19:52) literally tired We're We're literally tired of raising an extra baby It's like an extra baby Yeah I'll tell you why
(1:19:59) I'll explain it It's called solopism Yeah It's called It's called solypism It's be It's due to solopypsism It's
(1:20:05) because you think the world revolves around you Every time we talk about duties that women have even towards their own children even when we talk
(1:20:12) about No I'm just the opposite Saying it doesn't revolve around me In fact I'm saying that solopism itself is bad The
(1:20:18) idea of your own personal self-fululfillment over your children's welfare is a terrible mindset But every
(1:20:23) time we go back to it it's all about me me Materialism me me my fulfillment me
(1:20:29) me My journey it's all about you And so here this is the this is the fundamental
(1:20:35) crux and the problem in which we have Men have a duty right to keep their families together Women feel no such
(1:20:41) obligation This is why they're initiating these divorces because it don't feel they don't feel like they're
(1:20:46) getting enough out of it By the way again there is no possible way for you to demonstrate that women are working an
(1:20:52) additional 60 hours a week on household chores That's nuts And it's not even true Not only that women can't even put
(1:20:59) in a [ __ ] door knob They can't they can't fix any of the electrical problems They can't fix any of the plumbing They
(1:21:05) don't do any of that [ __ ] They just consider I I wonder if they in any of these stats they put any of that in
(1:21:10) there Not only that but let's point out the fact that all of society and all of its infrastructure is completely built
(1:21:16) by men The occupational hazard distinction is so distinct that almost all job occupations or job occupational
(1:21:23) deaths are men not women for this reason
(1:21:29) Same arguments Oh man men made this men made that men made some guy told me this Sorry The last alpha man that I was
(1:21:35) dating told me this We made you the dishwasher I go search who created dishwasher It was a woman the Wi-Fi that
(1:21:41) you are on using that also Women didn't make Wi-Fi That's a lie No no no It is And then there's so many so many
(1:21:47) discoveries that have been done by women that DNA that was another one that was taken by men because you know they like
(1:21:53) to steal stuff The thing revolves around you You keep saying that oh women didn't
(1:21:59) invent this We are the ones that are running the society and it's not all about us It is all about us We want to
(1:22:05) control you and we want to tell you how you should live and you should live listen to us because we're what we're
(1:22:11) saying is right for you How you feel is totally not concerned Like I'm I'm going to say the same thing It's better for a
(1:22:18) child to be with a stable parent with a stable mind than going crazy all the
(1:22:24) time or being unhappy or being depressed I was just listening to a thing today This woman that drowned her two kids She
(1:22:30) was married right like women are literally doing a lot of things that they can because of having kids and Yeah
(1:22:37) And Casey Anthony was single What's your point losing their mind Like you keep
(1:22:42) throwing me off whenever I'm talking You just keep like I don't know why you keep doing that So again I'm going to go back
(1:22:48) to my point that it is possible if you are separated Why can't you go see your
(1:22:54) kid i know that if I my child was ever taken away from me I will do anything in my power to go see that kid Why i mean
(1:23:01) these men they don't want to see the kid This is the whole [ __ ] that they go we're trying I don't know about us but
(1:23:08) over Yes Anyway all all lies again If you're
(1:23:13) talking about the modern dishwasher most definitely not invented by a woman which is exactly what your ex was talking
(1:23:18) about You're talking about an old handmade dishwasher from the 1800s lady
(1:23:24) Also George Anteill was the one who invented Wi-Fi that an an actress tried
(1:23:29) to steal credit for it and couldn't because she didn't know anything about engineering She literally didn't know anything about engineering like you
(1:23:35) don't even know what you're talking about Not only that uh yes when we're talking about just the distinction in
(1:23:41) occupational hazards why do you think that exists if men aren't the ones who are doing all of the infrastructure
(1:23:47) building why would you how is it that men can have so much occupational death if what they did wasn't dangerous versus
(1:23:54) women who what they do is not dangerous including basic things like uh uh law
(1:23:59) enforcement and military You still always have to appeal to men for the very force for rights that you always
(1:24:04) try to make the claims to Like all these feminist talking points are pure garbage They've been refuted a hundred times You
(1:24:11) have no leg to stand on And every time we dive closer into the arguments you come closer to my position than I come
(1:24:18) to yours You still want to limit suffrage You still want to limit these things And you make the claim that
(1:24:23) single motherhood right well that's a conditional of tiredness and exhaustion
(1:24:28) while at the same time saying but also it's the it's the best thing that you can do even though it's the hardest job
(1:24:34) ever which would lead to more exhaustion You're talking of both sides of your mouth constantly You need to make up you
(1:24:40) need to make up your mind on your own positions I'm talking from my mouth You're talking from your behind Um you
(1:24:47) see so don't like I don't understand I told you Yeah I agree with you because I'm with common sense That's why I
(1:24:53) agreed with you Yes we can drop the uh we can raise the age for that And I'm still going to say you yes I agree with
(1:25:00) you that for a child it's important for both parents to be there But you over and over again no it's the women's fault
(1:25:06) Now I said that is one thing that is one thing that men are not putting enough Then there's infidelity there's cheating
(1:25:13) there's other stuff too There's alcoholism there's drug use there's so many other factors to it I just told you
(1:25:19) one thing and you're just like "Oh I don't know." No I'm not going back on my thing I agree with you but I'm just
(1:25:25) asking where are these men where are these men you just keep making excuses for them getting divorced by the women
(1:25:31) this and they don't get it No it's your child You will make a way to go see your child Okay you can make a way to go date
(1:25:38) all these women these all these single men that have all this time to go and
(1:25:43) date all these women They don't have time for their own kids They will make no way to go see their own kids but they
(1:25:48) have time for 60 seconds for Andrew Well nobody's saying that there aren't scumbag men out there I would be the
(1:25:53) first to agree with you that there are some But here's the thing If you're the initiator of the divorce gives you time to plan And so a lot of times men are
(1:26:00) getting blindsided with these divorces pre-planned Women already have a lawyer ready to go and conventionally the court
(1:26:07) has awarded custody to them because they are in the no right they were the ones who planned the entire thing out
(1:26:13) meticulously And so you can't say the one hand like oh he can only have Junior every other weekend right he can only
(1:26:20) have him every other weekend You stripped him from his fatherly rights and then at the same time you're like just where are the men why aren't you
(1:26:25) paying enough support to me for me to live my luxurious lifestyle in raising the kid in the family I [ __ ]
(1:26:31) destroyed by divorcing the father Yeah that's brilliant logic lady Not only that let's point out a couple other
(1:26:36) things You keep on saying I'm talking out of my ass You were the one who just got done uh giving literally false
(1:26:42) information about how the person who made Wi-Fi was a woman an actress with no engineering background really
(1:26:48) whatsoever No it was invented by a man and she tried to take credit for it And
(1:26:53) feminists have often tried to give her credit for it but they can't They can't because she couldn't have made it It's
(1:26:59) well known now She couldn't have You're full of [ __ ]
(1:27:05) Well maybe you want to go on Google and fix that Cuz when we Google all those things it's it's something else Or did
(1:27:11) feminism has something to do with that too we bought Google and we changed everything Maybe you should actually read the stories you Google Yeah we did
(1:27:17) that too We did that too We did that Read the stories you Google Come back to the I'm going to come back to the poor
(1:27:23) men They get caught off guard Oh my god They didn't see it coming Of course you
(1:27:29) don't see it coming Cuz you don't you don't see it coming You've been told to change that light bulb Oh yeah What were
(1:27:35) you saying that I couldn't do a doorork knob i can circled around you doing things I've had men here that don't know
(1:27:40) how to [ __ ] do [ __ ] and I was the one fixing stuff Not to talk about technology today You might know it but
(1:27:48) men in average don't know nothing about technology They don't know anything smart how it goes They always ask me for
(1:27:54) help Anybody can't even change a light bulb So I don't know where you're coming from
(1:28:00) that women can't do this women can't do that Oh okay Andrew Well here let me
(1:28:05) just ask you a couple of basic questions How do you know what type of wattage light bulb you're supposed to use in a
(1:28:11) light bulb fixture how do you know what watt you're supposed to use you see it on the bulb before when you
(1:28:17) No How do you know the watt how do you know what watt light bulb to use not what wattage the light bulb is What
(1:28:24) wattage you're supposed to use for the fixture you're putting it in How do you know only there's only few ones that you
(1:28:30) can use Either it is the 40 60 or 100 depending on Yeah How do you know which one you should use how do you know which one you should use because there's only
(1:28:37) minimum Like you can use it from 40 to 100 How do you know which one you should use though you don't know do you what do
(1:28:44) you mean how do you know which one to How about a How about this here's a basic question In a light fixture in a
(1:28:49) lamp I don't have to put a bulb I go and I don't Here's a Here's here's a super a
(1:28:55) super duper basic question Okay super basic What is a band saw
(1:29:04) some kind of band saw I don't know What's a sawzaw a saw A sawzaw A sawzaw I don't know No
(1:29:12) you don't know Okay How many colors are on the wires that are going to the outlet that are in
(1:29:18) your wall right now maybe three four
(1:29:26) maybe six seven Like you don't know Why does it matter well because when you
(1:29:31) make these every feminist I talk to always pretends that they're Shira and can do all sorts of uh basic tasks
(1:29:37) around their house and the men are so incompetent they can't do it And then I ask them basic questions and they don't know [ __ ] about nothing Like let me ask
(1:29:44) you an easy one Here's a here's like here's the easiest one I can think of off top of my head How would you go
(1:29:51) about replacing a doorork knob very easy You buy a lock You need a
(1:29:57) screwdriver Two screws That's it Yeah How do you replace the knob itself what
(1:30:03) do you mean the knob yeah Like walk me through it It's like it's a handle right the handle Is that what you're talking
(1:30:08) about yeah Yeah It comes apart and then you put it up there You just grab a random one at the store You just grab a
(1:30:15) random one at the store I am not random one from the store No I
(1:30:20) have common sense When I take out something I take that to the store and I say "Okay this is what I need This is
(1:30:26) what I say This is what I need This is the type of battery I need." The thing is that I might not know all this stuff
(1:30:31) but when I need to fix something I can Google it I can YouTube it I have done a lot of things around my house I don't
(1:30:38) get into electrical because I don't want to die So I get an electrician But whether it was going to be a man sorry
(1:30:45) Yeah So I'm just pointing it out Every man is an electrician So even for a man
(1:30:50) has to hire another man to come do the electric work Okay By a licensed electrician which you should be doing
(1:30:57) Doesn't matter you're a man or a woman But the men that I've had working up here or the men that I have I have done
(1:31:03) more work I know more things than them around a house cuz none of them owned a damn house in their 40s cuz they were so
(1:31:10) freaking broke right cuz they made their life choices right their life choices
(1:31:15) pure solopism in their 40s and didn't even know literally my baby daddy went I
(1:31:21) was shocked He took a wet cloth went to go change a light bulb Guess what blew
(1:31:27) everywhere This is a man for you You are you know what you're talking about The men of today they think they know
(1:31:34) anything They don't know nothing Yeah they do Especially in our age bracket they know a lot They don't know nothing Ask the man to do anything around the
(1:31:40) house Well I wouldn't ask you You don't even know what a band saw is Why would I ask you to do anything around anything i
(1:31:46) need to use it I will know But then you'll know You'll get the Google machine It'll teach you
(1:31:55) And he lost You're muted right now I can't hear you And sorry my name is Molly not N but it's just my I think I
(1:32:02) signed in with my friend thing I'm just saying if I was to ask you here do you know this shade of this MAC lipstick
(1:32:09) will you know it no you wouldn't know it till unless you want to use it right i have every single tool up there Every
(1:32:15) time I have needed something I go buy it Then I get to know about it Okay You are always learning Yeah Yeah Yeah I'm just
(1:32:22) pointing out to you that there's a reason there's a reason I know more than lots of men in today's age they don't
(1:32:28) know [ __ ] They're useless Yeah I would I would make the exact opposite claim I'd say they're the only ones who know
(1:32:34) anything and you don't know [ __ ] But the thing is is like ultimately as we dive into this right you still haven't
(1:32:39) refuted any of my arguments here and you're still closer to my position than I am to yours If it is the case that we
(1:32:45) should limit suffrage right based on the meritocracy of the person we're already ruling out 18 Where should we put it is
(1:32:52) 26 27 does that sound pretty good to you no I personally think as soon as you
(1:32:57) start contributing and then then it also varies right like now some people start working at 18 So as long as you're
(1:33:04) contributing towards the society I think there has to be a limit to it I changing
(1:33:10) your position I would say I would say when you know your brain is fully developed probably around 23 24 But then
(1:33:16) again these are some things that we can talk about and I'm nowhere near your position You want to like bring you want
(1:33:22) to bring the back in the days I'm not saying I want to go back in the days I already lived in the back in the days I
(1:33:27) came to the future when I moved to Canada And I like it like this I don't want to live in the seventh century You
(1:33:32) know that even feminist theorists even feminist theorists make the claim that
(1:33:37) tradition are experiments which worked Right that's what tradition is An appeal to tradition is you're appealing to
(1:33:44) experiments in society which worked What I am showing you is that we had a bunch of experiments which worked We had
(1:33:49) intact households and we had children who are way better adjusted than children are now due to those intact households We we can look at this data
(1:33:56) from the past that we can learn what our future looks like Our future is very bleak Our reproduction rates are under
(1:34:02) replacement And due to that due to your idea of liberation we're going to have to bring in hordes of immigrants into
(1:34:08) our nations that don't necessarily share our values just to keep our population up And it's women who are the primary
(1:34:14) advocates for this This is a really stupid system And you still have not made a good argument for why it is that
(1:34:21) men shouldn't just usurp your right to vote altogether and just say you just shouldn't have it You just shouldn't And
(1:34:27) it's not like you could do anything about it So what's the actual argument for why you ought to have it why ought you be able to vote if women
(1:34:34) collectively when they vote make terrible [ __ ] decisions when it comes to society why should men allow you to vote
(1:34:41) i don't know I I don't know Like women I don't know why you're saying that I think it's more like white women cuz
(1:34:47) when you were talking about uh the reproduction um yeah no women are not
(1:34:52) having kids Have you looked at the abortion rates about black women hang on hang on hang on a second Don't please I
(1:34:58) think uh with reproduction um the way it is going I think you will bounce back
(1:35:04) It's not that I don't want you guys to be taken over by your um it's been doing this since 1800s It's been doing this
(1:35:10) since 1800s No but but Andrew my whole point is the way that you guys are trying to get women to have kids do you
(1:35:16) think it's going to work i don't think so Women don't want to have kids anymore because women have realized child kids
(1:35:22) are liability They are a lot of work I don't I'm not going to lie to you here Like Andrew says it's all easy It's all
(1:35:29) easy after But like you were saying eight hours during school while I'm at work at that eight hours So I'm not like
(1:35:35) out there partying it out right and then I have to come back and do all the other things So um like understand this like
(1:35:42) women don't want to have kids anymore It's too much Too much And then for you to keep forcing them that no you have to
(1:35:49) have kids You better serve the husband You better say they had to No No This is
(1:35:55) not going to I never made a claim that they have to do anything This is not going to lead women to have more kids
(1:36:01) That's why you're seeing according to you nothing is According to you nothing's going to lead them to having more kids And so ultimately it's not you
(1:36:08) just got done saying hang on hang on lady You just got done saying that kids are a liability and women don't want to
(1:36:14) have kids cuz they're too much work and they're too much of a liability So why have them at all this is what I'm talking about by your your pure solopism
(1:36:20) or your view of everything is self right what about your duties do you have do women have any greater duty to society
(1:36:27) is do they have a single greater duty to society just one Can you give me one
(1:36:34) yeah we have duty We've been doing our duties We contribute to the society all the time We're we are the sole
(1:36:40) caretakers of the whole uh you know kids We are the ones that have been right
(1:36:46) What are duty who has been taking care of the kids back in the days men are
(1:36:52) taking care of work Who taking care of the kids listen women have children Women women
(1:37:00) who takes care of the kids I'm going to explain it Okay It is actually men Please answer me physically Men men men
(1:37:08) women Yes I'll explain it You men I didn't say they breastfeed Would you
(1:37:14) would you let me qualify now so that you understand yes it's true And I answered
(1:37:20) your question Now I'm qualifying it I said men and now I'm going to qualify it
(1:37:26) So yes in the very vulnerable years cuz women are also vulnerable They rely on
(1:37:31) men for protection They literally rely on men for protection and status in society Hordes of mother men can just
(1:37:37) come take you away from Canada tomorrow lady if men weren't there with guns to scare them the [ __ ] off Men are
(1:37:43) responsible for the protection Because of that it's a greater duty that they have to society to protect it because
(1:37:48) women are the vulnerable sex Children in their vulnerable years are indeed stuck
(1:37:54) to a woman's chest That's correct But as they get older and get off the teat the responsibility still shifts over to the
(1:38:00) man He's still responsible for their health their welfare their well-being their nest egg their future their
(1:38:07) dynasty All of the things for that would create crossgenerational wealth Those resources come from the father almost
(1:38:14) exclusively Even in modernity it's mostly men who set up crossgenerational wealth not women So yes it's men who are
(1:38:21) taking care of the kids ultimately And they're making sure that society can function through defense so women can
(1:38:27) even breastfeed at all Not only that but can we just point out really quickly
(1:38:33) that you did not give a greater duty that women have you say take care of the kids How are you going to take care of
(1:38:38) kids if they don't [ __ ] have any lady well it's not like we have been doing
(1:38:44) that duty right like but it's still not enough Like we we were being forced to do that duty basically in a way Oh my
(1:38:49) god And then you and then you again I was talking about physically who stays home You yourself say it that it's
(1:38:56) better for women to stay home to raise during the vulnerable years Yes To shape up the society Right All these women
(1:39:04) have been doing that for centuries thousands of centuries they've been doing that Yes You have been protecting
(1:39:10) us Why because men are violent creatures and they will come and kill a human
(1:39:15) being who is pregnant Right Cuz only men can do that right only men can do it No women can do it too But men do it from
(1:39:21) men But my again back to my point if a woman that is pregnant and does not take
(1:39:27) care of her body or takes something poisonous and kills that child then what
(1:39:34) then that your protection doesn't matter Your anything doesn't matter You have to that nine months that that child is in
(1:39:41) my belly It's my responsibility You can come you can take care of me but it all
(1:39:46) depends on my physical thing If I am not okay that kid's not going to survive
(1:39:51) Right this is what you guys keep forgetting that we do have a duty We do want to do our duty but we don't want to
(1:39:57) be forced to do our duty What is your duty i'm saying all I'm here for is that
(1:40:03) I as a woman want to What is the duty though can you answer that what is the duty what is the duty our duty our duty
(1:40:11) of some of some women right if Okay let's let's look at in two ways If we were to talk about an evolution way and
(1:40:18) why we are here and why we're given these obviously it's for reproduction Okay Right Right I So you have a duty
(1:40:24) you have a duty to reproduce Totally agree I totally agree But do you have a duty to reproduce
(1:40:30) i don't I don't And in 2025 I don't know Well then what is the duty that women do have what duty do women actually have a
(1:40:36) greater duty like men we can be conscripted We can be Hang on Hang on Let me let me give you an example Men
(1:40:42) can be conscripted against their will to go fight wars on behalf of their nation Right this second in my country I can be
(1:40:49) conscripted to go fight a war on behalf of my nation The Ukraine right now they're being conscripted to fight wars on behalf of their nation If then that
(1:40:56) is a greater duty that men have to the nation What do women have like that what
(1:41:05) well uh first of all it's the men that are doing the wars So that's why men
(1:41:10) have to go there If they weren't doing the war then we wouldn't have to go there because women like to just fight you know like ah egos Uh secondly yes
(1:41:17) women are in healthcare like you were saying women are the educators Women are taking care of the running the child
(1:41:23) care We have a lot of roles Do they have a duty to do those things we have a lot of roles in the society I'm not talking
(1:41:29) about your roles Why don't you understand what I'm asking stop No No You're not answering my question I'm not
(1:41:34) asking about Yeah but you're misinterpreting the question I'm going to have to ask it again I'm not asking
(1:41:39) what roles women can do I'm not asking you that I'm not asking if women can be
(1:41:45) nurses or even if they are nurses or even if they love being nurses I'm
(1:41:50) asking if they have a duty to be a nurse Just like I have a duty to fight and defend my nation if the call of duty
(1:41:56) comes up What duty do women have that's like that not what things do women do
(1:42:02) That's not what I'm asking you Well as a duty I would say my duty uh before that I have to have kids and that's my first
(1:42:09) duty is to be a human being a good human being and you know contribute to the society that I'm living in right that's
(1:42:15) my priority Don't you agree that men have that same duty hang on Hang on But
(1:42:21) you as a man only see me as a uterus right that's the whole problem There's men women out there that don't want to
(1:42:27) have kids They don't see it as a duty that they don't have a duty born a woman now I have to have a kid Why why you
(1:42:36) know I don't know why you won't answer my You keep asking me questions I keep trying to answer you I was just saying
(1:42:42) that Hang on Let me finish this one last thing Right You guys keep complaining about like oh my god our civilization is
(1:42:47) coming to an end It all depends if you want to be moral or immoral right like it all depends like if you're religious
(1:42:54) or not But you know you can have surrogates you can have women You can have women All right Put 100 women aside
(1:43:01) go have kids go nuts You want kids you want civilization What is the purpose or
(1:43:06) you want the civilization and you want the family system and all that along with it right it does come down to it
(1:43:13) But your civilization is not going to end because the way the future is going is going to be different You do you not
(1:43:20) know soon we're going to be having artificial embryos We're going towards the robots thing I don't know where
(1:43:26) you're sitting Andrew We're going towards the robots I can't wait to get myself a robot I swear to God that's the
(1:43:32) best investment No I think so So okay Well I I mean I wouldn't wish for that because if there's artificial wombs and
(1:43:38) society and society can reproduce itself and society can reproduce itself without
(1:43:44) having wombs I don't know what you think happens to the status of women but it isn't going to be very good for you Not
(1:43:50) only that but let us just point out very quickly that when I asked for what a greater duty was you gave me descriptors
(1:43:55) of things that women like That's not a duty When I ask you are they obliged to do these things must they do them do
(1:44:01) they have a duty to do them you say "No they don't." You can't point to a single duty you think women have in modernity
(1:44:08) Things they must do Even if they don't want to Men don't want to get conscripted and go to war They must even
(1:44:15) if they don't [ __ ] want to they must go do that Do women do you believe women
(1:44:20) have any duty that's like that to society a thing that they must do even
(1:44:25) if they don't like it yeah And as we're all contributing we're
(1:44:30) trying to be good people We're trying to teach people That's men and women What about women specifically i'm asking
(1:44:36) about women specifically Listen to me We have to go to war You guys can stand up
(1:44:42) and you guys can say we don't want to go to war You got to have to fight and then the country dies Then the country dies
(1:44:48) Again these are your menly problems right you created them We created them I
(1:44:53) created them Created system Your little ego gets hurt You press a button You start divor Like look at all what's
(1:44:59) happening That little Zillinsky His ego is hurt So he's [ __ ] getting all his soldiers killed I'm all against that So
(1:45:06) wait a second Wait a second So let me get this right If bad men want to attack us do you want good men to fight them if
(1:45:13) if bad men want to take over Canada the place you currently I guess are in because the Canadian flag If bad men
(1:45:20) come in want to take that over do you want good men to stop him do you want
(1:45:25) them to yeah Okay So so then that seems like there's an implied duty there that men
(1:45:32) have because of the need of what you have to have in order to have a nation
(1:45:37) Can you tell me what that same thing is that applies only to women don't give me something that men and women both have
(1:45:44) to be good people They both do What is equal to that that applies to women only as a duty what
(1:45:51) uh well if you were to ask me today yeah I guess we have a duty to be a decent
(1:45:56) human being and contribute into the society That's our duty Don't men Don't men have that duty too uh I don't know I
(1:46:03) guess yeah you you should Okay Well then what woman only duty what what woman
(1:46:08) specific duty do you have then woman specific not men and women I know I know
(1:46:13) You keep saying that over and over again Yeah Can you tell me what it is you think our duty is only to give birth
(1:46:19) Don't Don't tell me what I think Answer my question What do women have a duty or
(1:46:24) not to do anything what the people do to the society we
(1:46:30) were evil Okay I'm going to try this again I'm going to try this again because I I think you just you just
(1:46:36) maybe just don't understand I don't know how many times I can rephrase this We and I both agreed that men have a
(1:46:42) specific duty that only men can serve the function in Do women specific it's a
(1:46:47) woman only duty Only women can do this right what do Can you name one that they
(1:46:53) have that's the equivalent of that can you name it anything I'll take anything that is woman specific Our duty
(1:47:02) as women is not to be evil and be empathetic So go around Well don't you
(1:47:08) think that's a duty of men too don't you think that's a duty of men too no men don't We have a
(1:47:14) den commit more crime You guys are more violent You have more pedos You guys are
(1:47:20) more Yeah but don't you think we shouldn't but don't you think we shouldn't don't you think we have a duty to not do those things you should but
(1:47:28) you No Right Okay So then that So then that's a shared duty What's a woman What's a woman specific duty that's on
(1:47:35) par with the man specific duty of defense of the nation what that duty is created by you you men yourself We
(1:47:42) didn't create that duty for you So nothing You can't name anything lady You can't name anything No no I told you
(1:47:49) we're good citizens and we're not evil Cuz if we We're not evil If we acted
(1:47:55) like men like we are sometimes now Men don't really like it But yeah How many babies How many babies have women killed
(1:48:00) in the last 30 years yeah You're not evil How many How many babies have women killed in the last 30 years you want to
(1:48:06) take a gander i don't know I don't know How many babies How many men have gone and raped little kids like come on Can
(1:48:13) you How many women have They do it in school all the time Not as many as men Oh they do it in school all the time And
(1:48:19) when you look at the metrics when you look at the metrics they take I'm sure there is But men you can say are more
(1:48:26) Men actually abuse men too Okay Women actually abuse women too and men What
(1:48:31) are you talking about and they do it when they're at the vulnerable age When they're children they do it when they're
(1:48:37) children But even if that was the case even if it was the case that more men did evil thing than women descriptively
(1:48:42) that was true you would still agree they both had a duty to not do those things And I would agree with that So what I'm
(1:48:49) asking you for is since men actually have a specific duty based on just their
(1:48:55) genetics the fact that they have a penis and have and are stronger than women to defend the nation to give me the
(1:49:01) equivalent thing that women have What is it same I'm going to tell you the same It's
(1:49:07) not I don't think it's a man's duty to go and be uh in the you know serve in
(1:49:12) the army I don't think so Forcing a man to do finish my point is ridiculous Again that's a man-made whole thing Okay
(1:49:20) As a human being you should be decent which you men are not We're more empathetic That's why we're not
(1:49:26) committing all these crimes which you men are You kill your own children dude You kill your own kids You know that you
(1:49:33) shouldn't You can argue that that women are doing it I'm not denying it But there's more men doing it There's more
(1:49:38) men in the more men killing their own kids than women More serial killer men There's all kinds of data on this I
(1:49:43) don't know what you're talking Yeah And you know what there's a lot here's the thing When we do the gathering of this data especially when you take into rape
(1:49:49) statistics and things like this here's what we find That they take things like non-penetrative acts as not being rape
(1:49:55) That it's not essay when uh women do the exact same thing to a woman that a woman does to a man that's not counted as rape
(1:50:01) The thing is is that ultimately I can make a really good case that when it comes to sexual assault women are
(1:50:07) actually the primary perpetrators of it not men And it's just not reported by the men as being sexual assault Not only
(1:50:13) that let's point out a couple other things Don't talk to me about how women aren't evil when they have a million abortions a year That's [ __ ] evil
(1:50:20) Also you still haven't actually named a primary duty that women have society at all Only share duties that you believe
(1:50:27) men and women both should have And that's the problem You don't feel like women have any greater duty to society
(1:50:33) other than whatever the [ __ ] they want that makes them feel good Whatever makes them feel good that's their duty Even
(1:50:41) the not being evil is just part of a feel-good plan You should not be evil because it makes you feel good That's
(1:50:46) the only justification you could ever give me for anything cuz you know you don't believe in Sky Daddy right
(1:50:53) give you the last word Ma Leech But I do want to mention we're going to go into the Q&A in just a minute So I'll give
(1:50:59) you about a minute or so to respond Okay And then um what you were talking about that we are evil We could be evil There
(1:51:06) is certain um history you can see some women can be evil However we're not We choose not to Otherwise we are the ones
(1:51:13) cooking for you All these husbands would be dropping dead Okay It's very easy to um you know you know you get it There
(1:51:19) was aquatana I think there is It was in the 1800s that that woman used and all
(1:51:24) these husbands were dropping dead So no we do We don't have the duty that a man wants
(1:51:31) us to do in 2025 I'll still stick to that That as a human being as a citizen
(1:51:36) of Canada I have a duty to be here And yes if there was a time that there was
(1:51:41) some kind of danger I will be out there also trying to protect whoever I can cuz I think as a human being that's my
(1:51:48) responsibility It's not like oh it's a man or a woman Again you're wrong on the whole thing that men are not raping more
(1:51:55) Actually with women too when those stat statistics are put in there you don't
(1:52:00) know They're all counting as sexual assault You don't know which one was rape but you don't know which one was groping which one was what So they're
(1:52:05) all grouped in together but the data says that it's mostly men that do this
(1:52:11) I'm not going to deny but you're going to deny And for the longest time men I have good evidence against it My god And
(1:52:17) lastly I'm going to finish with me with this whole thing that in religions and throughout history you have seen that
(1:52:24) women have been sexslaved used as sexslaved and little kids and gotten
(1:52:29) married to underage kids throughout history It's first time in our history that we have actually a legit age 18
(1:52:37) years old where you can get married to an 18-year-old Otherwise all our grandmothers were married at 12 or 13
(1:52:42) not too long ago Thank you We're going to jump into the Q&A I want to say a couple of quick things first needs
(1:52:50) What's that don't we get closing statements if you guys would like closings we can do that Yeah I would
(1:52:55) like In fact this might be a good opportunity if either of you have to use the restroom while the other one is
(1:53:01) giving their closing because we do have a good amount of questions here for the Q&A We will start with Alich The floor
(1:53:08) is all yours for your closing What do you guys think minute two minutes five minutes Yeah I'll I I think a couple of
(1:53:15) minutes is fine Yeah Alish go ahead Couple of minutes Um I I just want to
(1:53:21) thank you and also Andrew for taking this time to come ahead and have these conversation with me Um why I advocate
(1:53:27) for certain things is because I have lived into that society the religious society where women actually don't have
(1:53:33) rights We see that every day happening It might not be happening here you know uh few few years ago if you were to ever
(1:53:40) ask all these Pakistani guys would be like oh you never say anything to the Canadian white men and I'm like no
(1:53:45) because white men are different you know they're different they're not like this they're not like this but I've seen a shift I in the f past three years and
(1:53:52) then I dated somebody and I've always dated white guys and I was just like I was looking at this man and I'm like are
(1:53:57) you sure you're not Muslim are you sure you don't want to move to like Afghanistan with his mentality so I'm
(1:54:03) just seeing this shift that is happening and it is not good Like I totally believe there should be a little balance
(1:54:10) White women do go nuts Like I again I'm not going to lie They tell me that I'm Islamophobe because I'm criticizing
(1:54:17) Islam and a woman defending Islam is like KFC defending chicken You know what I mean it's just I just don't get it So
(1:54:25) I totally understand where you're coming from My whole point is that this whole argument this fight between the sexes I
(1:54:31) it's not going to end well if we just keep throwing names at each other like I see online And I totally get it why
(1:54:37) Twitter is that way or X is that way cuz you're rage baiting and you're doing this and you got to bring you know those
(1:54:43) only fans models and Instagram models because that's where you get the views You're not going to bring like no none
(1:54:49) up there So we we totally get it where you're going up there But how is it going to affect the society the hatred
(1:54:56) that you're building about women in men's heart that is something already there The insult community is already
(1:55:02) there Men are already lonely and you're pushing them even more away Even ugly guys are not being [ __ ] to women and
(1:55:08) women are just like okay now we're not even going to deal with it I'm telling you this that women are literally saying
(1:55:14) that we're done we don't even want to date we don't want to have kids and I don't think that is a good thing that is
(1:55:19) not a good thing for the society what we need to do is we need to have more of a conversations and not take like
(1:55:26) literally human rights away you can't control anyone you can ask and you can
(1:55:31) be nice and if that person loves you they they might submit themselves But you cannot be like "Oh submit and serve
(1:55:38) me and I'm going to do whatever I want." It won't work that way Thank you It's really funny She says "It won't work
(1:55:44) that way." And then says "But in my country of origin it works that way just fine." Right Literally works that way and there's nothing they can do about it
(1:55:50) It doesn't work It doesn't work It doesn't work It's working right this second It is a country and they do it and there's nothing you could do about
(1:55:56) it We'll give it to What do you like what are you gonna do about it you can't do anything You just come to the West where Christians are very gracious to
(1:56:03) you and you [ __ ] all over them Anyway thing is is back to the it's my closing lady It's my closing I didn't interrupt
(1:56:08) your closing Don't interrupt my closing statement You have to give my closing over Christians Don't put words in my
(1:56:15) mouth He did He called it sky daddy He called it sky daddy Don't pretend you're not [ __ ] on sky daddies Why do you
(1:56:20) think I'm calling Allah sky daddy yeah you meant some other sky When you say you believe in sky daddy you think I
(1:56:27) that I think you're referencing the Islamic God That's some real high IQ [ __ ] there Anyway so my closing
(1:56:33) statement we'll just go through it Uh yes men do do all the infrastructure jobs She was completely wrong on that I
(1:56:39) have the stats in front of me It's not even close Uh there's been an estimated 63 million abortions to date I think
(1:56:45) it's actually probably significantly higher than that When she says women aren't evil that's hilarious N out of 10
(1:56:50) kids in juvenile facilities report essay and say it was perpetrated by a female staff member 68% of malreated children
(1:56:57) are abused by female caregivers Women are more likely to abuse when they have power overwhelmingly in comparison to
(1:57:03) men I have stat after stat after stat refuding this This woman is out of her
(1:57:08) mind with this stuff She doesn't understand uh what she's even talking about Also when I asked her "Do women
(1:57:13) have any greater duty which is on par to conscription that men would have to go and defend the nation." She couldn't do
(1:57:19) anything but give me shared duties When I and then she switched her argument twice First she said "I do believe that
(1:57:25) men should go and defend us from bad men and they have a duty to do that And then she switched it and said "No no no no no
(1:57:32) I mean I would go fight on the front lines with men too." It's like come on You ain't fighting on No you ain't
(1:57:37) fighting over anything except what type of blush to get next week Also let's
(1:57:42) point out a couple other interesting facts right as we went through this debate I refuted basically every single
(1:57:49) argument that she had She never refuted any of mine She did agree with me that suffrage needs to be limited Then she
(1:57:54) backed up on that view when she realized the implications of it Right feminism has been a massive failure She can't
(1:58:01) even make any prescriptive claims for what's good to society except to say and appeal to men and say if you were just
(1:58:06) nicer to us we would do more stuff for you But when we when we started to hone
(1:58:12) in on that she also said "No actually children are a liability." Very anti-natalist position Actually children
(1:58:18) are a liability So women are checking out It has nothing actually to do with whether or not they're mistreated by men
(1:58:23) and she says "Actually ugly men are treating women good and they still just check out." So she contradicts her position every 5 seconds There's like
(1:58:31) there's no consistency from this woman at all on her own positions She never refuted my argument She never showed how
(1:58:37) her society is better than the one we came from And also when we move back and I showed her in mental illness uh
(1:58:44) factors that you had way more well adjusted children um just going back 60
(1:58:49) years ago and 70 years ago than you do right now in these two parent households that contradicted her statement of the
(1:58:55) abuse of the mother You know what I mean it's just one contradiction after another All right I we're going to jump
(1:59:00) into the Q&A Thanks for your questions folks This first one coming in from Cole Marshall says easy Andrew W Thank you
(1:59:06) for hosting Andrew and thank you Andrew for all of the great content Make sure your kind words is Cole Appreciate your
(1:59:12) positivity Emperor Fats Dog says to Malich "What rights do women not have
(1:59:19) that men do have in Western countries?"
(1:59:25) You might be on I do agree with you that in Western countries women have all the rights I never said that Uh again um a
(1:59:32) lot of things that Andrew was saying just putting things in my mouth like I was never saying I was never bashing on the western country that's why I'm here
(1:59:38) So no I don't think there is any right in Canada in Canada I'm talking about I
(1:59:43) I can't speak for us but in most western countries women have rights Yeah This one come in Emperor Fat Dog Strikes
(1:59:50) again says "Malich can you name one modern Christian country that has laws that treat women like property cuz to me
(1:59:57) it seems like the ones that do are third world non-Christian slash pro-Muslim
(2:00:04) [ __ ] hole countries." Yeah I agree with you I never disagreed with you Why Why do you think I'm here
(2:00:10) um but um like Andrew was saying like you know what happened in Pakistan and stuff if you compare Pakistan to the
(2:00:16) last 50 years the women have been fighting they are getting better but you have to understand it's Islam where we're dealing with you know Christianity
(2:00:23) also went through that whole thing but we haven't gone through that reform yet That's why we moved here because we
(2:00:28) thought you know Christianity has reformed but apparently we're going back to traditional Christianity hasn't reformed It stayed exactly the same
(2:00:35) Orthodox Christianity same as it was 2,000 years ago Again we can we can go into so many terms There's Baptists
(2:00:40) there's Orthodox there's a neo-Christians there's so many right so many thought processes This one coming
(2:00:46) in from do appreciate it Emperor Fatisto Shakes again says "If men are quote unquote scared Malich why were we the
(2:00:55) ones who fought all the major wars in the past 3,000 years and were the ones who brought safety and protection to our
(2:01:01) homes and communities because uh women obviously were weaker
(2:01:07) and uh yeah it is all about resources and stuff and that's how societyy's worked up there You go back in the you
(2:01:13) know if you see how we've evolved and we started living in tribes that's how it worked that that didn't mean that women
(2:01:18) didn't contribute into things Of course women were doing things when these guys went to war right and like I said back
(2:01:25) in the days maybe we needed the wars and we needed the resources and it it is going to go on And this is how evolution
(2:01:31) we've evolved Yeah men did go but now in the future we're going to have drones
(2:01:36) running Like with the way we're going we're not even going to need men to go fight the war soon Like Yeah Well why don't you go look at Russia and Ukraine
(2:01:43) and then get back to me on that one I'm not talking about in the future I'm not talking about right now This is the future is now Conventional warfare
(2:01:49) Conventional warfare still hasn't changed from you're in the trench with a gun It always revolves to that In the
(2:01:56) future in the future it's going to be the same It's still going to come down to men with brute force because technology is always going to require
(2:02:03) brute force to use This one coming in from do appreciate your question Issa Kabir says "Malich how do you see
(2:02:10) women's rights evolving in South Asia
(2:02:16) so they are evolving Um they have been evolving Uh I remember President Musher was up there um and he he changed a lot
(2:02:23) of laws like for example women couldn't step outside alone You had to have a mahim guy right and um so now he changed
(2:02:31) that There was other few things He made a little I guess you didn't need two witnesses for a rape So he changed that
(2:02:37) There is one thing that is uh women have been really pushing for is a domestic violence bill in Pakistan and uh the
(2:02:44) males or the imams will come up and they're like yeah yeah we want you to pass everything just where it says you
(2:02:50) can't hit your wife just remove that and then you can pass it so that bill is not passing because women want to abuse like
(2:02:56) physical beating we want to take it out but because it says in the Quran and they can't go anything against Sharia so
(2:03:01) it is evolving can I ask you a question that I'm curious about you know getting more rights than they did 50 years ago
(2:03:08) Definitely Can I ask you a question how can you reconcile this position that you
(2:03:13) know that men are the ones who are the guaranters of your rights and I you know this because you say well men are always
(2:03:20) fighting with each other right that's a man thing and it's like well wait a second you just escaped or you escaped
(2:03:26) from Pakistan which was completely filled with what you would consider to be evil men to go take solace from good
(2:03:34) men to protect you from those evil men like do you understand that You're
(2:03:40) implying that the good men now who are protecting you have a duty to do that Do you understand the implication there i
(2:03:46) came taking refuge Yes it was men and majority of them were following this religion However if we didn't have that
(2:03:53) religion involved in that democracy we would have rights So then we could talk
(2:03:59) So the only reason why we have rights here is because religion is not in the states and is separate That's why we
(2:04:05) have these all political processes No no no That can't that listen that's not true that's dogma itself like rights the
(2:04:11) constitution stuff like that's in itself dogma right you live basically in a
(2:04:16) religious institution even if you think it's secular you have men in black robes who give you the law this is all
(2:04:22) basically dogmatic it's its own institution of religion the west versus the east it has its same hang on hang on
(2:04:29) lady wait a sec wait a second has the same I'm almost done it has the same types of institutional uh ideologies
(2:04:36) that religion does But the point is you escaped from bad men to take solace with
(2:04:43) what you consider to be good men right in which infers that they have a duty to
(2:04:49) protect you because you couldn't take solace there if men with guns weren't protecting you 24 hours a day Islamists
(2:04:55) would come cut your head off wouldn't they to give you the last word on this question because we've gone way off
(2:05:00) topic from the South Asia question Uh no It you know what I mean like yes it can
(2:05:06) happen but like I said Pakistan has changed Yeah if they really wanted to come and kill you anybody can be killed
(2:05:12) big you know bin Air got killed in that way Um but you keep saying that I came here from evil men Yes I can say that
(2:05:19) they're evil men No it was the government it was the system because it's run by a religion I came here and
(2:05:27) the system protected me which definitely probably was created by men but
(2:05:33) because here we here the system was in a way Next question guys holy crap or you
(2:05:40) know take my rights away that's why I came here So yam yam says John Lockach who the
(2:05:46) founders looked up to dismantled patriarchy in two treatises on civil
(2:05:53) government effectively a feminist who used the Bible as proof
(2:06:00) I don't know that's I don't know who that's addressed to I'm not even sure what I don't like John Lock enlightenment principles and I don't I
(2:06:06) don't like I don't like canian philosophy in general or what's considered continental philosophy I
(2:06:12) think it says a whole lot of [ __ ] nothing I think it literally says a whole lot of nothing ultimately
(2:06:18) This one coming in from do appreciate your question Bitter truth says Andrew does all human do did all humans come
(2:06:25) from Adam and Eve if yes would if yes I would say no and I am
(2:06:31) challenging you if you can prove it Well I don't what does that have to do with
(2:06:36) this debate nothing The brand Delalorian says women like
(2:06:42) such as Malich are the reason Iran became a
(2:06:48) theocracy Is this true Malich no It must be coming from a man No Women
(2:06:55) like me are the ones uh that now women can do a lot of things in Pakistan right
(2:07:00) because we broke free and we didn't confine to the rules and laws by um the
(2:07:06) religion So I I that was my friend I guess he was asking because you know this is the thing with the religious
(2:07:11) people they will be like oh we're talking about common sense we're talking about common sense but when we talk about religion then their common sense
(2:07:16) totally disappears right so that's like a contradiction on its own uh any if you're following any religion I have
(2:07:22) this personal experience it doesn't matter I've seen this in men in general that they don't want to give rights most
(2:07:30) of the religions are misogynistic mostly in favor of men because they were made by men poor men So obviously the
(2:07:37) traditional ones don't want us to have any right Right So this one coming in from do appreciate your question Speedy
(2:07:44) Lee says "Andrew aged 10 years tonight." You look great Andrew And Emperor fat
(2:07:50) ass dog says "Malich if the Western world is so sexist then why don't you go
(2:07:56) back to the village you came from instead of living in such an quote unquote awful society?" Yeah And he
(2:08:02) didn't overcome anything You fled You fled You fled You didn't overcome
(2:08:07) [ __ ] You fled Overcome what you said that you you overcame adversity You
(2:08:13) didn't overcome anything You You fled I have I have not made one claim sitting
(2:08:18) here that I don't appreciate Canada or Canada hasn't given anything to me or that we don't have women's right here
(2:08:26) What I did come here and this is why I'm speaking up about it because I like it the way it is Women like the way it is
(2:08:32) You guys don't You guys wanted to go back to what I left Exactly My point No nobody nobody ever advocated for that
(2:08:39) Just making it up He asked me a question No I'm not making anything up I
(2:08:44) I have lived that experience where you're forced to stay in a marriage where kids are forced to stay in an
(2:08:49) abused household And what happens you know I see this every day and night I listen and talk to women from every day
(2:08:56) and that live in the society want Anyways I have never said this Whoever
(2:09:02) asked me this I never said that that I don't appreciate where I am That's why I am here Okay i never said that we don't
(2:09:09) have rights here So please you know go back to your country I don't want to go back to my country because Canada is my
(2:09:14) country and I love Canada It gives And a bunch of men with guns protect you A bunch of men's with gun bunch of men
(2:09:20) with guns protect you I don't know Like there's only some men that will protect me Have you seen most of the men these
(2:09:25) days what are you talking about these men These men These men can't do [ __ ] Most Have you seen Yeah I know I know I
(2:09:31) know Oh the men can't do [ __ ] You can't You can't change a doororknob but men can't do [ __ ] You can't change a [ __ ]
(2:09:37) door anymore They're women Okay They're literally becoming women They're
(2:09:42) literally becoming women to get into our spaces Literally You can thank feminism
(2:09:47) for that too This one No no it was men in there too It's men and women No that
(2:09:52) was pure feminism Who are the trans women who are the trans women who enables them women voters White women
(2:10:01) Leo not just white women Leo Whitmer says "Malich according to Pew Research
(2:10:06) Muslims are having way more children than atheists How do you plan on preventing Muslim oppression if they
(2:10:13) just replace you in the next generation which they will?"
(2:10:18) um no again um yes they are reproducing but if you go into Pakistan and even
(2:10:23) India their reproduction has also started declining because women are not
(2:10:28) having kids I already told you there was a huge thing that came out that a lot of women I think it was like about 40% of
(2:10:34) the women over the age of 35 are now single with no kids So if you think
(2:10:39) anywhere in the world where there's education besides from Africa women are
(2:10:45) getting educated they're having less kids Okay Secondly is the financial thing You can't afford to have 10 kids
(2:10:51) anymore It is just not financially possible for you Right Feminism this one
(2:10:56) No it's not possible How are you going to How are you going to put like 10 kids on me with my job and I can't afford it
(2:11:01) yeah Again but so so the thing is is like that doesn't actually answer Listen it doesn't answer his question It
(2:11:06) doesn't answer doesn't answer his question His question is it doesn't
(2:11:12) matter if their birth rates are declining slightly and they are I agree with you on that Not everywhere in the
(2:11:17) world but in some places right they still outpace atheists I mean
(2:11:22) ridiculously they outpace atheist Okay When Muslims tell you this oh my god so many people are converting So many
(2:11:29) people are converting We're not talking about conversion We're talking about reproduction Question was his question was because
(2:11:36) they're reproduction reproducing so much How are you going to counter it yes
(2:11:42) Can you let me talk just answer the question then The actual question Asking dog Oh my god Holy [ __ ] Ask answer the
(2:11:49) actual question Oh my Can you answer it just answer it
(2:11:55) done Okay So it is already on a decline right but this whole propaganda where
(2:12:01) Muslims keeps telling you yes there is reproduction going up But let me tell you as much as they are trying to like
(2:12:07) have babies most of these people are now leaving Islam If tomorrow they took away
(2:12:12) the whole thing in uh if anybody can just choose their own religion or leave Islam in Iran in Pakistan half of 50% of
(2:12:19) the population is not even Islamic anymore Hang on Because I belong to the ex-Muslim community and it's a huge
(2:12:27) community So people have never [ __ ] list of questions We have to move through this faster So I need more pathy
(2:12:33) responses from both sides Hlap says "Andrew how many times you've been divorced bro this one from Even Lord
(2:12:40) says for both debaters what would be the problem if the government gives every man a wife and forces them to stay
(2:12:47) together under the threat of penalties uh well I mean for me that would be a
(2:12:53) violation of Christian ethics Um so I mean definitely I would not say that
(2:12:58) that would be the strategy which I would utilize I think that you can use much bolder and easier strategies including
(2:13:05) uh propaganda campaigns at the top of the government which would reinforce nuclear families or reinforce traditional families things like this I
(2:13:12) think that's those are much better strategies which wouldn't actually violate the ethical foundations of Christianity
(2:13:19) This one coming in from do appreciate your question Even Laura says the debate shows the failures of
(2:13:24) multiculturalism Any thoughts you guys both agree on that one I agree with it I think that I think that the idea the
(2:13:31) idea comes in where she where she basically says the assistance is in multiculturalism is the ne the necessity
(2:13:37) for offsetting the the the crisis in reproduction She has no other answer than that Like let her answer this
(2:13:43) question right now She will be able to give you no answers on the reproduction crisis other than immigration Watch No
(2:13:49) Go ahead I never said that I never said that I wasn't here saying that Oh yeah You need to I I am the one that keeps
(2:13:55) telling you don't bring these people that want to bring their shitty ideologies here I am the one that was talking about it five six years ago How
(2:14:02) do you fix the reproduction crisis i am You asked me a question Let me That's the question I asked Yeah So I'm
(2:14:10) answering So answer that question How do you fix the reproduction crisis how you don't You don't I told you No No You can
(2:14:17) You can Yeah You don't You can You can You can do it two ways And I gave you this answer before It all depends if you
(2:14:23) want to do it morally immorally You can do it morally Morally Morally Well I don't know Morally you're going to have
(2:14:29) to force women into having babies now You're going to have to do it They don't want to Even like I'm Got You're making
(2:14:35) Islam's argument for him We're going to keep this moving guys All right What's the other I think you said two What's
(2:14:41) the other three did you say there were two reasons
(2:14:46) did you give both of them or did you give just one well she said she said I I said this earlier too He just keeps
(2:14:52) interrupting I'm just saying it depends on moral or not moral You can have hundred or thousand women give them
(2:14:57) benefits Okay you know what we're going to give you this much benefits You're going to have to have three kids each There is a civilization white
(2:15:03) civilization blue eyes blonde hair you know but then it's not moral right so we have to understand is it moral ethical
(2:15:10) that sounds moral to me Why would that be immoral why would that be immoral got a lot of questions here We got to keep moving That's how you can solve it There
(2:15:17) you go Straight shot It doesn't solve it They tried it See Andrew what research shows that secular institutions molest
(2:15:23) children 100 times more than Christian yeah DM me on Twitter and I'll send it
(2:15:28) over to you It was actually a very interesting uh eye openener for me that secular institution including public
(2:15:35) schools up to the rate was uh was estimated up to 100 times more than even
(2:15:41) the Catholic church Um and I think it was like 60 or uh 60 times more than in
(2:15:48) rabbitic institutions which I guess they have the highest rate So I wonder what's more likely to make the news if a public
(2:15:55) school teacher molests somebody or a person of the faith the cloth
(2:16:01) Uh well I think they're I think they're both pretty likely No You think they're equally likely i think it would be more
(2:16:09) likely that you'd see it from the uh public school side before you would see it on the person of the cloth side to
(2:16:16) make the news To make the news now yeah this one from even Lord says Muhammad
(2:16:22) peace be upon him was right about women Even Lord says Confucious was right
(2:16:27) about women Even they also say the Buddha was right about women and Mchavelli was right about women Okay
(2:16:34) Rachel Wilson says 98% of all infrastructure jobs are still held by men The technologically advanced world
(2:16:40) you live in that gives you the illusion that you can do all these things doesn't exist without men You are
(2:16:48) delusional Malich Yeah And all those men come out of

(2:17:16) like it This one coming in from do appreciate it Uh one minute if it's Andrew not two
(2:17:23) minutes Even Lord says King Solomon is right about women Rachel Wilson says "I think it's hilarious that the lady
(2:17:29) thinks she belongs anywhere near a debate She should stick to putting on
(2:17:34) lipstick." Wow Rachel isn't she the one that got insulted by her husband that was called a five i mean you shouldn't

(2:20:39) pumping their chest Oh my god this and this and this Call me names That's all good That's all good I think Andrew Tate
(2:20:44) matters more than you do Andrew Tate is a pedophile too It matters but he matters He matters more
(2:20:51) than you do Religion He matters more than you do A pedal religion but he matters more than you do
(2:20:57) This one coming in from I'm glad that I'm not known as a child pedophile you
(2:21:02) know I'm glad Thank you We must move on This one coming in from do appreciate it
(2:21:09) Project V pods is for the Q&A This is for Malich Can you please define the
(2:21:15) word duty great show by the way How do you define duty duty is
(2:21:22) something that you have to do like my duty in a Canadian society like I came
(2:21:27) to Canada right I give I give the duty to be a legal sorry I do everything
(2:21:33) legal here I contribute to my society I contribute into the things that I'm doing right I work I pay my taxes that
(2:21:40) is my duty those are the things I'm doing that's how society keeps moving and that's those are the things that
(2:21:45) were asked of me when I came to Canada so that those are the duty and yes tomorrow if somebody was to come invade
(2:21:51) And if I can I will try my best to go fight out there Okay i'm not just saying it Thank you So yeah really simply a
(2:21:59) duty is an obligation absent an entitlement This one coming in from do appreciate it
(2:22:05) Straight shot says "Andrew would you rather live in a secular western society where women women vote or a Muslim
(2:22:12) dominated male only vote country?" or right now I would still rather live in a
(2:22:18) secular society where women vote than I would in a Muslim society But I would rather live in a Christian patriarchal
(2:22:23) society over both Tai Per says all you're like what you're asking me is
(2:22:29) would you rather drink bleach or straight poison that's like that's what you're asking
(2:22:35) Taiper says Andrew does Malleach ever stop talking and Ivan Jr says "If men
(2:22:41) didn't have duty and didn't step up we all would live in a forest/jungle/ desert without nothing If
(2:22:49) we gave women empty land to build without men they would achieve mudstick
(2:22:55) hut garden Women would die in one year True or false?"
(2:23:02) Well yeah But see the thing is you would need that woman so they can be born And
(2:23:08) of course that woman had to take care of them nine months by herself cuz the men were out there gone forwards or whatever
(2:23:14) right so they had to take care of them So if they didn't then you wouldn't be born and then of course that was her duty at that time to bear kids and then
(2:23:21) that was your duty to go and build the system So we worked together simple this
(2:23:26) uh Andrew thoughts I guess you probably would think that was true I would guess I mean no the the thing is is that there
(2:23:33) was a greater duty that men had and women actually understood that duty they
(2:23:39) were in a supportive role and they did actually follow the obligations I agree with that But the problem is is that she
(2:23:44) claims women don't have obligations now They don't have these duties She just claims that well men have this duty When
(2:23:51) you ask her what her duties are or what women's duties are she basically says that they don't have any She just says
(2:23:57) and then she just changes it to say no I was just kidding I I think I I think I do When she's caught in the logic trap
(2:24:03) it's like this is this is how every feminist ever is when you debate with them They don't think that women have
(2:24:08) any greater duties to society And when women immigrate from more patriarchal lands here you can see they become
(2:24:15) feminists very very very quickly And then they advocate this poison on our kids
(2:24:21) I don't like hang on Hang on No you can't just put words in my mouth Uh I am not advocating for that I've already
(2:24:27) told you I don't know why you keep repeating yourself and keep because I heard you until you got trapped You didn't change your position I was here I
(2:24:34) was here for the debate lady What position no What position your position was do men have do men have an
(2:24:42) obligation my position is No no no no My position I already told you that back in the days maybe the women had the duty to
(2:24:49) have babies but we don't have that duty We don't see it that way Some women might want to see it that way but not
(2:24:54) everybody that has a uterus wants to have a kid You want everybody that has a uterus to have a baby and it ain't going
(2:25:00) to work I just wanted to see it as a duty Yeah I think that I think they should see I think they should see
(2:25:05) reproduction as a duty Okay let me make it clear because you keep interrupting me You don't understand men Okay women
(2:25:11) in 2025 don't have that duty to have a kid I think they do Again oh my god you it
(2:25:19) doesn't matter what you think I'm telling you what doesn't matter what you [ __ ] think then Doesn't matter what you think I'm telling you what women
(2:25:25) think I think that's what I'm saying Malik you were making a point What were you What was the last thing keeps
(2:25:31) interrupting me and then because he's a big debater he does that and then your brain just goes here and there What I
(2:25:37) was saying that I don't think in 2025 we have the duty to have a kid but in 2025 we all have a duty to be a decent human
(2:25:44) being contribute to the society we're living in follow legally These are all your duties when you're living into the
(2:25:49) I can't live in this community and [ __ ] on this community and have like bunch of [ __ ] outside I'm not going to be allowed
(2:25:55) to live up here You're [ __ ] on the You're [ __ ] on the community right now No I'm not [ __ ] on any will put
(2:26:00) words in my mouth No What community am I [ __ ] on you're [ __ ] on by by you by you taking away [ __ ] on your
(2:26:07) ideology Yeah By you taking away You haven't [ __ ] on my ideology You've never made a cogent point yet What you've done
(2:26:13) is this My turn Lady Lady I didn't interrupt you Calm down Let me respond Calm down Calm down Let me finish Calm
(2:26:21) down Calm down Calm down One sec All right All right I hate to do this but I've got Calm down Calm down So So what
(2:26:28) I'm saying yeah You see how you're freaking out just calm down Okay Pardon my interruption but just to be sure that
(2:26:34) we have I think the last question I had asked Was that the one on the mud
(2:26:40) putt is that the No it wasn't Was the last question I asked no they're asking about the duty part
(2:26:47) Oh how do you define duty okay And the last question that was being
(2:26:53) discussed between the two of you what was the last question that one of you asked we were we were we were discussing
(2:26:58) duties I was just pointing out here or I at least was trying to respond to her and explain to her like listen yes I can
(2:27:06) have moral oughts and I can have a moral ought for what I think women's duties to society should be or shouldn't be You're
(2:27:12) just making the claim like oh but they don't That's descriptive It's not an ugh I don't know why you don't get it It's
(2:27:18) because you're not very smart but I'm trying to explain it to you over and over and over again Okay Malich what are
(2:27:24) your thoughts so I know you probably have a round religiously I think religious people think that women just
(2:27:29) because they were born with a uterus it's our duty to reproduce But I believe that in 2025 no we do not The women that
(2:27:36) want to have kids you can put them in a place thousand women go reproduce Your civilization ain't going to die But like
(2:27:42) I said I wasn't [ __ ] on any ideology or any of Canada or anything So don't put the words in my mouth You are
(2:27:49) actually by by by doing this you are by doing this you are actually [ __ ] on Canada You are actually [ __ ] on
(2:27:56) Canada because what happens is Canada's also under Canada Can I make my [ __ ]
(2:28:02) point lady chill out for two seconds Chill out for two seconds Hold on Okay Again you are [ __ ] on Canada Here's
(2:28:08) how Canada's under reproduction race as well By you saying women there have no
(2:28:13) duties at all to the nation to reproduce its domestic population You are [ __ ] on your very countrymen You lunatic
(2:28:20) Stupid argument And it's not a stupid argument It's the best argument You're going to get overrun by third world
(2:28:26) hordes because of this Okay Hold on one sec You guys take a deep breath Maliche I'll give you a chance to respond Yeah I
(2:28:32) mean I'm amazed that Malich I'm like intervening to give you a chance to have the last word So I don't know why you're
(2:28:38) shaking your head Relax No last word Every time I open my mouth he interrupts and then I lose my train of thought
(2:28:44) That's not how you debate That's you think that's been happening with me Every time I open my mouth he
(2:28:49) interrupted Oh you've interrupted plenty No there have been there have been a number of interruptions from both sides
(2:28:55) So Malach this is a chance for you to respond to what Andrew just said I'm going to finish my point that I am not
(2:29:01) [ __ ] on Canada I have given you if the declining rate is going on it's not my fault It's all by design It's not
(2:29:08) only feminism That's what I've been telling you that it's not only feminism that women are not having kids It's the
(2:29:14) it's everything the whole society We're not back in the days You have to understand and take those factors into it You keep saying "Oh I'm [ __ ] onto
(2:29:20) it." No I love Canada It gives me all the rights that I never had I would rather not be anywhere I love Canada I
(2:29:26) don't know what you're talking about Keep saying "Oh you're [ __ ] on it." If they want to solve it I already gave you the solution You want to solve it
(2:29:33) Now other countries like Hungary are giving women that are having two or three kids They're giving incentives to
(2:29:39) work Okay Well that doesn't work We have to try something right you
(2:29:45) just do like you'll filibuster for an hour
(2:29:50) lady Because just because [ __ ] Hey Jeez Louise You guys I'll give you the
(2:29:56) Okay I'm going to give you the last word Mish I'm done There's no point because he
(2:30:03) keeps interrupting and then I go get thrown off This is his technique and then he'll be like "Oh I won." Okay So
(2:30:08) what we'll do here is it is true like Andrew is that when I do say I'm going to give Malich last word and then you
(2:30:14) follow up with a question like you have to self-regulate and not keep pushing it because we do have more questions to get
(2:30:20) to So if you can do that for me we'll give Malich a last word and then we have to move to the next question What that
(2:30:25) means is when I say we're going to give Malich the last word it means just let her have like a 60 seconds to speak Okay
(2:30:31) I think that's fair James but can I ask you a question like if that's the case I wouldn't interrupt as much if the
(2:30:37) question that was asked was actually being answered And so if it's not being answered that's why I interject I'm like
(2:30:43) that's not what's being asked Please answer what's being asked So if you don't enforce the questions being
(2:30:48) answered I have to interrupt
(2:30:54) I sympathize with Andrew's concern in the sense that granting if there is a
(2:31:00) question that's not being answered So Malich or give you a chance Yeah Well sometimes what happens when I start
(2:31:07) talking and I'm trying to get I know he interrupts I know what you're going to say Yeah he interrupts Right Then again
(2:31:12) the whole point that because Canada's rate is declining I'm all for finding
(2:31:17) solutions for it I am not like oh yeah dump bunch of people from Afghanistan in here I'm not all for that I've always
(2:31:23) been against it If you want legal immigration people should be vetted out like it was before You don't you
(2:31:29) shouldn't be in you know transporting other [ __ ] third world countries problems Sorry about my French into
(2:31:34) Canada I'm totally against it But for you to say here you're [ __ ] on Canada because reproduction rate is
(2:31:40) going down because of me Am I the only one i did a job I have a child Well I'm talking about those women of today They
(2:31:46) don't think they don't feel that is their duty because you're forcing them to And it is not their duty in 2025 to
(2:31:52) have a kid But he wants to have a kid That's fine If they don't you can't force them This one coming in from Pink
(2:31:58) Panther says "If this woman was a Christian we'd end up right here She just hates rules and wants things her
(2:32:04) way She will get phased out like the rest Uh yeah rules Rules made by men
(2:32:12) right men don't like women that step outside that block I know that very well because I come from that culture So you
(2:32:18) know for us just showing my hair it's it's like the whole thing don't show your hair because I'm going to get tempted and I might attack you So I have
(2:32:25) to behave I have to cover up because so you can control yourself right then again this becomes the whole religious
(2:32:30) thing It's the rules are created by men men who made that religion which favored
(2:32:35) them Circle Thank you Rachel Wilson says "So she comes here to
(2:32:42) enjoy the good treatment and protection of Western men then insults them saying they can't do anything and she doesn't
(2:32:49) need them Send her back."
(2:32:54) I mean you did say that I mean like seriously Rachel you you should be ashamed Like you were you're just a five
(2:33:00) You're just a five You're just other other white men find me attractive and all I've dated is white men Actually you
(2:33:07) might uh Yeah No Why should you send me back why what have I done here that you should send me back i'm not [ __ ] on
(2:33:12) him I'm [ __ ] on his ideology I didn't come here and say Andrew is a shitty person No I said what you think
(2:33:18) and what kind of system you want is a shitty thing But if you had your own thoughts besides from your husband's
(2:33:25) thoughts you would know what I'm trying to get at But yeah send her back Send her back
(2:33:30) That's your solution What do you do i don't Why don't you understand lady can you stop talking for 5 seconds i was I
(2:33:37) was asked the question right yeah I mean are you ever am I ever going to be able to respond to any of this and Andrew
(2:33:42) Andrew has been waiting patiently So I do want to give Andrew a chance too Like look you still didn't actually respond
(2:33:48) to what she said She said "At the same time you're over there enjoying Canadian protections you're [ __ ] on the very men who are giving it to you." You're
(2:33:54) like "The men around here don't know how to do anything The men around here are dumb The men around here can't change a light bulb Oh my god." You're [ __ ]
(2:34:00) on the very society that you're in there enjoying the privileges of from the evil men you apparently escape from Typical
(2:34:06) feminist cognitive dissonance Typical feminist cognitive dissonance
(2:34:12) I'm [ __ ] on men everywhere Men everywhere are becoming losers Men in general of this day are becoming they're
(2:34:17) becoming Yeah Tell you need to hide from men with men They need to hide They need Not all men Not all men But you keep
(2:34:24) saying that that I'm [ __ ] on the Canadian men or [ __ ] on this I am not [ __ ] on anybody I love it here
(2:34:29) That's why I'm here So I don't know I just don't like that you want to put women under submission and under control
(2:34:36) and take their voting rights away and take their anonymity away That's what I'm against You keep throwing it back to
(2:34:41) oh you're hating this I know what you're doing but it's not working This one coming in from Ivan Jr says Ma Leachch
(2:34:51) one more time you didn't answer my question I said if we gave women their own plot of land in 2025 by themselves
(2:34:58) without men would they survive to be fair she actually I think she said no Um they say this means not working together
(2:35:05) or birthing Okay What did he say if if they gave a
(2:35:10) land to a woman in 2025 will I survive there would they survive without men and
(2:35:16) then they say this means not working together or birthing
(2:35:21) you're not working with men You're not having children Okay So I actually have a land It's like an off-grid property
(2:35:27) that I bought just to land and yeah we've uh parked a camper up there We took solar lights We took a little I
(2:35:34) have a generator We went there and then yeah that's where I go for like a week and we survived and it was just me and my actually other single mother without
(2:35:41) kiss It was amazing Yeah we can survive Thank you Lord says Malich follows her company daddy or
(2:35:49) corporate daddy not a sky daddy I think they mean like your boss at work
(2:35:55) I am my own boss I work for myself So thank you Brandon Christian says "This screeching feminist is a great argument
(2:36:01) for deporting H-1B visa immigrants She brings nothing of value to the new world."
(2:36:09) No I'm I bring a lot of value to the new world You guys want to live in the old world You just don't like it that I
(2:36:14) don't want women enslaved I'm just asking for women to be treated like human beings And people have problem
(2:36:20) They're telling me that you should go back home You don't belong here you [ __ ] on Canada All I'm saying and that that
(2:36:25) women and this is what we're saying even in Pakistan just treat women like human beings We're human beings right we also
(2:36:32) have visions We also have dreams You also want to maybe not have kids right thank you This one from even Lord says
(2:36:38) Jesus and Paul were right about women Aristotle was right about women And this one comes
(2:36:44) from Kelvin the engineer says "Are these duties absolute should we punish the
(2:36:50) infertile or nuns?" This is absurd No it's not insur absurd So all you
(2:36:57) would see it as is some kind of obligation towards the hot It doesn't mean there's not going to be exceptions
(2:37:02) and that there's not going to be reasonable exceptions and everybody would accept that but just the idea that there could be a duty towards something
(2:37:09) Um even if you grant exceptions not only is there no contradiction but that's how society works now There's lots of people
(2:37:15) who can't serve on juries but everybody has an obligation duty to do so Even if you can't they might be disqualified
(2:37:22) from it for whatever reason but you still have a civic duty to do the thing Like why don't why don't you people get
(2:37:29) that this one coming in from Maverick Thanks for your generous super chat says "If I had to steal man her argument
(2:37:35) women do have duties but every duty a woman has a man should also have."
(2:37:40) However since men have duties that women don't and likely won't have society is
(2:37:47) left lopsided and incentive focused above
(2:37:54) all I didn't get that part from her argument
(2:37:59) I don't know why Like the fact that our only duty is just to have kids is just
(2:38:05) ridiculous because nobody said that's your only duty Nobody said that That's what you were saying
(2:38:10) No nobody said it's your only duty Nobody said it's your only duty Just making [ __ ] up again
(2:38:17) There's someone coming in from Malicia It sounds looks like you had something you wanted to say Go ahead No
(2:38:23) I was just going to say that that you know what like I said uh we all have duties Like we all have duties We stay
(2:38:29) in which communities we're living in As a society you have to have those duties like he said like you know um it's the
(2:38:35) same thing if you want to go if I was to be go and um what do you call on a trial or whatever I was called tomorrow then
(2:38:42) yeah it's my duty to go I'm going to do it but that's what I'm saying like in 2025 you can't what are you going to do
(2:38:48) women that are not having kids you're going to freaking punish them put them in prison what are you going to do you can't force women you can't do anything
(2:38:54) by force that's my whole point here well okay but first of all that's literally a
(2:38:59) lie because men in your home country do things by force all the [ __ ] time and there's not a damn thing you can do
(2:39:05) about it So that's just descriptively a lie But second nobody made an advocation that women need to be forced to have
(2:39:11) children That's not what anybody by the way that's not even the history of the nation in question here in the United
(2:39:16) States Men were not forcing women into pregnancy They weren't doing that That
(2:39:22) was not how the laws even were governed You crazy lunatic There was no such thing as marital rape
(2:39:29) Okay So you don't know that Yeah It's called implied consent It's called implied consent Do you know what implied
(2:39:35) consent is no No No Implied consent No No No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes No No Yeah
(2:39:42) Yeah This one coming in from Rachel Wilson strikes again Said "You you said
(2:39:47) that men can't do anything and you don't need them You said they're worthless
(2:39:53) Those are the same men giving you rights and protecting you."
(2:39:59) Yeah The good men the useless men I'm not saying that all men are like that but most of the men of these days they
(2:40:04) become lazy and they're like that But no yeah you're you're right And I'm not going to deny that I'm not dependent on
(2:40:10) this Like for example like Andrew says tomorrow the men get up and they're like "Oh screw this We're going to enslave
(2:40:15) all the women What are we going to do we're not going to do nothing They're going to enslave us." But then it comes to the question of morality right then
(2:40:21) I'm going to ask you so I'm not saying that yes men are not protecting us and all this and I do I really need them No
(2:40:29) I can I can want them I do want men It's not that I don't want them Do I really need them like you asked me about
(2:40:35) surviving on a land in 2025 when you park a camper made by men and generators made by men on your property Great That
(2:40:42) was a great argument that you made there Not only that you're appealing to the religion The same men who have the
(2:40:47) religion of the moral The same men who have the religion of the moral u that they won't enslave women are the same
(2:40:53) exact men that you vilify by calling their god a sky daddy You lunatic Are you saying that Christianity allowed
(2:41:00) didn't allow slavery is that what you're saying that they they were the they Christianity was the was the proponent
(2:41:05) at the front end of the abolition of slavery For sure 100% That Christian how
(2:41:11) long before they actually abolished it that was the whole world That was the whole world was under slavery But the
(2:41:18) whole world end it then they did end it when they did end it Why so long because
(2:41:26) that what you're doing is making an argument fallacy from presentism Don't you understand the entire world operated
(2:41:33) under the conditionals of slavery You can't impugn the one people group
(2:41:39) Christians who were the spearhead of getting rid of slavery Like that's what you're doing You're punishing them for
(2:41:45) being the very first to make sure there was no more slaves The hell is wrong with you
(2:41:51) you were the one who ended it I will give you that I'll give you that And this is the argument that exactly we get from uh Islam right and this is what we
(2:41:58) asked him like when Muhammad came well how come he didn't finish slavery how come he it's all about morals and this but he kept sex slaves He he kept slaves
(2:42:06) Jesus didn't keep any slaves He kept sex slavery going on I'm not arguing that I
(2:42:11) don't like Islam What are you talking about christians It was the Christians Yes That recognized it and finished it
(2:42:18) But my question to the teachings of Jesus Christ so long ago why now why is
(2:42:23) all when you have I'll explain I'll answer your question You did have it for all those
(2:42:30) Let me answer the question I'll make it super Andrew wise I'll make it super concise When the entire world operates
(2:42:36) under a single system for its entire existence it takes a really [ __ ] long time to abolish whatever that system is
(2:42:43) In this case we're talking about slavery It takes a really long time Apostles were advocating against it in the very
(2:42:49) beginning almost everywhere that they went What are you talking about just because Rome didn't immediately crumble
(2:42:57) uh and the rest of the nations didn't immediately crumble under the weight of Christianity it took a long long long
(2:43:03) time That was how the whole world operated But to say that the abolitionists the ones who actually got
(2:43:09) rid of slavery who were Christians are somehow bad because they were the first of the party of reforming it is insane
(2:43:15) That's insane And you making that as a declaration By the way at that same time by that same logic at that same time all
(2:43:22) secularists also believed in slavery Just so you know all non-Christians believed in slavery All atheists
(2:43:28) believed in slavery too I'll give you a chance if you want to
(2:43:33) give a pathy response Yeah No I'm not arguing with that That everybody didn't believe it Obviously because that was
(2:43:40) the way it was right we understand it But then when you come and sit here and say like morally we're claiming this and
(2:43:46) that No if you were morally right then you should have you know stopped that long time ago It you did stop it but it
(2:43:52) took you so long like M should have stopped it when he came but no they give you the same argument like you're giving us Yeah There's a couple hundred
(2:43:58) Christians there Like Christianity took a really long time to build in numbers
(2:44:03) Do you understand my god Why are you so this is crazy to me Really what an
(2:44:10) absurd argument most absurd argument I'm just telling you that you know then
(2:44:15) you're going to sit here and make moral claims that I'm going to ask you Well why did it take that long why not right
(2:44:21) away why not in like you know we covered this I think that we already asked that
(2:44:27) Um Andrew I think already we're going to go to the next question I do want to give you credit Malich You
(2:44:35) have shown up where you have had many critics Most questions have been directed at you some of them a little
(2:44:41) bit hostile So I will give you credit that you are here and you're not a punk
(2:44:47) because you're here and you haven't left Uh but that being said get ready for
(2:44:53) some insults This one from Pink Panther says "You're mad at men because you're getting phased out." Is phased out is
(2:45:01) that that idea of like hitting the wall is that what they're saying
(2:45:06) yeah Okay Depends for who who for him Am I phasing out i don't even know Pink Panther a guy named Pink Panther he's
(2:45:12) calling me phased out Meanwhile I have like people that I don't even want to men I don't even want to talk to
(2:45:17) messaging me all the time I don't know Reality is pretty bad And I choose to be single and I don't want to talk to them
(2:45:24) So yeah you can sit there and sit here and be like "Oh yeah nobody's wanting her." But that's not reality You guys
(2:45:31) need to come out of like internet world and look outside Okay men are you guys
(2:45:36) are so desperate that you literally will sleep with a woman from the grave or you
(2:45:41) will go sleep with a dog or you go to the glory bowl for you to be that I am faith You want to see the stats on
(2:45:49) peanut butter and women and dogs lady you want to see the stats on women and peanut butter and dogs you want to see
(2:45:55) the stats it's not very It's not looking good for you in the beastiality department
(2:46:01) Oh my god Nasty stuff Uh to be fair Pink Panther it might be that they think
(2:46:06) you're you're phasing out because it might be that they're 13 We don't know the ages of these people Dana Mc for
(2:46:12) example probably a 13-year-old Edgeelord says "Can she make me a sandwich?" So
(2:46:18) these probably are some of these probably are 13y olds Oh I run a cooking I run a cooking catering company I can
(2:46:24) give you references of my alpha man ex-boyfriend He can tell me I fed him for a year if I can cook or not Forget
(2:46:30) sandwiches All this liberation You cook men food All this liberation and you you cook men food for a living What i know I
(2:46:39) I don't cook for men I cook for women and people I restaurants only cook for
(2:46:46) men Restaurants only are for men Is that what you're saying uh lady it's a joke It's a lady It was a
(2:46:53) joke Calm down No but I'm just saying your jokes are stupid Make some like good jokes That was a good joke It
(2:46:59) wasn't a good joke You're like "Oh sorry I'm sorry Are families only men don't wives cook for the entire family it's
(2:47:05) the same thing You're serving your family In this case you're just serving the general public doing the same exact thing Cooking Same [ __ ] Yeah Yeah There
(2:47:13) you go This one coming in from do appreciate it Ivan Jr says "Malich
(2:47:19) didn't answer." We got that one James Monroe Marone says "Uh Malich your worldview is haram." Abdul grab the
(2:47:28) rocks Who's Abdul haram Okay Haram Coffee over there Dana Mc we got that
(2:47:34) one Rachel Wilson says "I just want you to admit that you should be more
(2:47:40) grateful to men for creating this technologically advanced world for you to live in You need an attitude
(2:47:47) adjustment Say you're sorry for man-hating." Malich
(2:47:54) no You're a little bee You can treat Andrew like that Ask him to say sorry No I never said that I was ungrateful I'm
(2:48:00) glad that Canada the system that was here that was probably created by men and women gave me this opportunity to be
(2:48:06) here that I can sit here openly and talk like this because most of the places I wouldn't be right but you as somebody
(2:48:13) who sits there trades never said that once She's just
(2:48:18) making [ __ ] up again Jesus this Jesus that I am like so good and I'm this I'm this Everybody's evil All these women
(2:48:25) are [ __ ] and [ __ ] Meanwhile doesn't say that either history like you're just making [ __ ] up Personal attacks on you

(2:48:57) wait to watch her eviscerate your stupid ass arguments It take her even shorter amount of time than me
(2:49:03) Wow If you thought it was heated so far get ready This is uh from less says
(2:49:11) Malich you are insufferable You have no idea of how to debate and you should be
(2:49:18) grateful that Andrew a skilled debater took time out of his day to entertain you in all caps
(2:49:26) Oh Oh Andrew sir Oh my god Thank you Otherwise that's a good attitude Let's
(2:49:31) try Can we do more of that attitude talking to like all these 20 year olds calling them prostitutes cuz that's
(2:49:37) that's way better You mean the ones that are prostitutes you need You need to talk to different people Is there a
(2:49:43) problem certain kind of women i'm sorry I've debated Hey hang on I've debated every major political debater on planet
(2:49:50) Earth What about you where depends on where Not in the Canadian Yeah Where yeah Nothing So
(2:49:57) you're mad at me So what you what it is is you're mad at me because I will have debates with people who want to have the
(2:50:02) debates and I don't I don't refuse them because they're prostitutes That's what you're angry at me about Pardoned I
(2:50:09) thanked you for your time but I'm not going to sit here and be like cuz I'm also giving my time And if you want to
(2:50:15) go and search me what I do you can go on Google and see where Can you answer to what I just said to you can you answer
(2:50:21) to what I just said to you do you think I should deny women the ability to debate with me and my ideas because they're prostitutes no Then shut up You
(2:50:29) think your argument is stupid you should be calling them prostitutes What if they are prostitutes word for it What if they
(2:50:36) are prostitutes they're adult workers They're adult workers First of all
(2:50:42) prostitute What's a prostitute explain It's a woman who sells her body to a man

(2:51:02) penetrated by a man Taking money physically She's taking money virtually She's taking money in all in all of
(2:51:09) those all of those categories All of those categories are prostitution Yes No
(2:51:14) Prostitution is not all those categories Yes it is Why don't you I'll tell you what I'll tell you what Tell me the
(2:51:20) definition of prostitution Prostitution is in person You know you can't That's not definition online How
(2:51:28) you pro online i'll give you here I'll just do it for you So you're saying that um having sex with multiple men that's
(2:51:37) what prostitutes do how no that's not what I said Multiple men on camera I'm going to give you the the definition of
(2:51:42) prostitute so that you understand it Okay A person particularly a woman who's engaged Stop stop talking stop talking
(2:51:49) while I give you the definition so that you understand what this word actually means A person in in particular a woman
(2:51:55) who engages in sexual activity for payment Does it matter if it's digital
(2:52:01) no it doesn't matter if it's digital It's definitionally true that they're prostitutes I don't even know why you're
(2:52:07) making apologetics on behalf of prostitution Prostitution has always been where you
(2:52:13) go and you have whole full intercourse How many of these men are having intercesses you mean women
(2:52:20) men what do What are you talking about women How many men are they sleeping with are they sleeping with multiple men
(2:52:27) on camera and trying yes Yes They call it BG content They call it
(2:52:34) BG content Boy girl content Yes They sleep with men on camera for money dummy
(2:52:41) The men paying them for sleeping Sometimes they do Yeah Sometimes they go and they prostitute themselves that way
(2:52:46) as well Yes Like what are you talking about that scam is not prostituting You're like Yes It's it's prostitution
(2:52:53) Everything is a prostitute Everything is a sex Okay So yes If you take money in exchange for having sex and exchanging
(2:53:00) sexual favors you're a prostitute definitionally What do you want me to say about that define sexual favors Right Define There's so many different
(2:53:06) things you could be doing Define sexual favors All of those things that you would consider a category of sexual favor Whatever you think a sexual favor
(2:53:13) is would be prostitution So you think uh the women on Instagram because they're also selling a lot of things You think
(2:53:19) they're prostitutes as well what are they selling well basically their bodies right like
(2:53:24) they Sorry Which ones are how are they selling their bodies
(2:53:30) no you just said that right is it a direct transactional exchange for you to
(2:53:35) have some sort of sexual gratification it so if they're doing a direct transactional exchange for your sexual
(2:53:42) gratification using their body Yeah They're prostitutes Yes So I'll give you an example Instagram you have subscriber
(2:53:49) only mode right you post a picture very provocative one in a sexy very pose Now
(2:53:56) that guy has paid $3 for a subscription and then he goes and he busts one out and he gives himself a hand job Now is
(2:54:03) that prostitution to you if you're intent that would derived intent So if your intentionality there was in order
(2:54:10) to somehow sexually gratify him in exchange for money yes that would be prostitution If your intent was not to
(2:54:15) do that So like if some guy just grabbed a random poster of a hot actress and and rubbed one out she's not engaging in
(2:54:22) prostitution But the intentionality like with all crimes by the way matters here
(2:54:28) Literally it matters Of course it matters So if intentionally a woman was like "I'm going to give you pictures of
(2:54:34) my feet so that you cuz it'll it'll make you I don't know uh sexually gratified
(2:54:40) in some way and that's why she's selling the picture of her feet on purpose in order to sexually gratify men." She'd be
(2:54:45) engaging in prostitution Yes All right we're going to move to the next one This has just been a ton of interesting ideas
(2:54:53) Chris Scott says "The joke was awesome 100 years of liberation and you're still in the
(2:54:59) kitchen." Cole Marshall says "Please special guest." Rachel Sorry the kitchen part It's a necessity You have to eat
(2:55:06) right is I don't think it's a man or a woman thing It's just a necessity It's just something you got It's a lifestyle
(2:55:11) thing You got to cook Marshall says "Please special guest Rachel Wilson You can't spell Wilson without being a
(2:55:18) without a big fat W Intello says "Andrew it's very interesting The abolition of
(2:55:23) slavery coincided with enlightenment and the industrial revolution not
(2:55:29) Christianity." Uh well I mean it did actually especially when you look at uh
(2:55:35) reformers and if you look at the trend that Christianity was already going for I admit fully admit that enlightenment
(2:55:42) principles uh were definitely pushing um you know towards abolition as well I
(2:55:48) fully admit that that is true But a lot of the um enlightenment principles were
(2:55:53) based around men who were Christians and the credit a lot of them actually give
(2:55:59) credit to their faith for this and reference God multiple times as being the informant for their moral So it's
(2:56:05) like you can you can kind of judge that how you want but Christianity was definitely at the spearhead of abolition
(2:56:12) especially in England This is a case in England especially This is uh I even said that they didn't
(2:56:21) think their question was answered So I'll read it again They said Malich didn't answer my question You answered
(2:56:27) it with existing infrastructure Who built your offgrid cabin women or men
(2:56:34) can women build from zero and survive without men in other words they mean like with no buildings no campers
(2:56:42) They're saying just dropped in the forest They can women build infrastructure
(2:56:48) So where this uh offgrid is So we went there to check out like other people are building their cabins and stuff So we
(2:56:53) went around and I met two women actually They were in both in their 60s and 70s and I was shocked to see them Both of
(2:56:59) them were there by myself There was another woman and she was about 70s something years old with the help of her
(2:57:06) daughter They literally had built a cabin and this this is I'm talking about like you have to bring all this lumber
(2:57:12) in You have to bring it up there and do all this and I was shocked cuz I probably won't be able to do it but they
(2:57:17) actually did create it was about like 10 by 10 those women are doing it and see
(2:57:22) you this whole competition has to stop Can you do this can you do this can you do this you won't be you're coming out
(2:57:29) of like a woman Come on You know you're coming out of a woman This competition has to stop That's is why women are not
(2:57:34) having kids anymore because the same kid is going to get up and be like "Well we built this for you You better submit and
(2:57:39) serve to me." It's like "No it doesn't work that way." So women are saying "No we don't want to have kids." Rachel
(2:57:45) Wilson says "I'm not better than anyone Lord have mercy on me a sinner I just told the truth Feminism failed to
(2:57:51) protect women and I won't lie about that."
(2:57:56) It did It failed in its promise to women No buddy It saved me I'm good I'm happy
(2:58:02) There's a lot of women that are out of relationships There's a lot of women that were able to get out of abusive
(2:58:09) relationships because you know where the abusive relationships go Again Andrew she asked me you can talk
(2:58:16) to her at home or she doesn't talk to you at home This one from I don't know I can't understand you I just hear
(2:58:21) clucking noises What were you saying pink Panther says like right there Your
(2:58:27) your wife is right there You can talk to her right there Let me talk to her Right She asked me a question Let me
(2:58:33) answer Is that okay yeah But well you take forever to answer
(2:58:38) Cuz you keep interrupting me right yes we get it Do you want more time cuz
(2:58:45) would you No no I was answering He interrupted answering for his wife So let's go on I guess you should ask all
(2:58:51) him question Give him the time cuz he seems like he's not getting enough Thank you
(2:58:56) So sometimes you interrupt Andrew as well you guys interrupt each other but
(2:59:02) like all the time that you use when you say like "Well Andrew interrupts me." It's like that's a great time slot where
(2:59:10) you could just say whatever you want to say to Rachel Like cuz it's true that I
(2:59:15) was right like but when you have a thought in your head and somebody interrupts you it goes away It just disappears So what do you want me to say
(2:59:22) i don't even remember now what she asked Pink Panther it's gone It's lost in the ether It's gone forever Pink Panther
(2:59:29) says "You're bragging about men that you don't even want." Much laughing my ass
(2:59:34) off I think he's talking about "Are you bragging about these like fat greasy old
(2:59:41) men that are sliding into your DMs and that you don't even want like why brag
(2:59:46) about them if they're like these fat greasy smelly?" Bragging about them I I didn't even have to mention it here when
(2:59:52) somebody but some when when you were going to come up here Oh like she's phasing out or she's hitting the wall then I have to show you the reality
(2:59:59) right like you're you're just in delusional land thinking that women are if if it was a for us to just go have
(3:00:05) sex and we can't find a man to have sex with or hold somebody down you're you're delusional Yeah they'll [ __ ] you but
(3:00:11) they ain't putting a ring on it Oh they will I've got three sitting upstairs You want me to show you yeah show me the
(3:00:16) ones that put a ring on it I don't believe it You have three men sitting upstairs right now This Zachary rings
(3:00:23) Rings I will next time when we do Andrew Actually this is the first use So you use men to buy you rings You use men to
(3:00:29) buy rings This is one of them And then I'll show you another two upstairs They are upstairs Next time when we debate
(3:00:36) Why are you Why are you taking rings from men when you say that women don't want to get married including you you just using men for their money yeah I
(3:00:42) just kind of changed my mind Uh you know when So you're just using men for money didn't work out Didn't work out I I
(3:00:48) could have married them and then divorced them Why didn't you give him the rings back why didn't you give him the rings back you didn't want it back
(3:00:54) Didn't want it back But I'm just saying that I could have married three times I would have gotten
(3:01:00) divorced three times and taken all their money but I didn't Thank you Oh wow You
(3:01:06) deserve a medal I do I do because you guys claim all
(3:01:11) these women are getting married because they want the money Oh my god Seriously I did it He kept the wig lady He kept
(3:01:18) the legs He didn't want it back We'll move to the next one Zachary G says "Wait if prostitution is in person it
(3:01:24) sounds like Malich prostituted herself The move to Canada makes
(3:01:30) sense I don't understand I don't even know That must be like the most intelligent alpha man out there to ask
(3:01:36) that question I don't even I don't even know what to say to that." Yeah I prostituted myself from Pakistan to
(3:01:42) Canada to Canadian Leo Whitmer says "Malich how many kids
(3:01:47) do you have if it's under three then your argument of Muslim converts is moot to my question of Muslims replacing you
(3:01:53) in the next generation." I would argue with you I
(3:01:59) have one kid but I would argue with you because the thing is you guys are in your own circle You don't know the
(3:02:05) circle of people that are ex-Muslim and how fast people are leaving Islam And
(3:02:10) the people that are leaving Islam and these are Pakistani Muslims their kids are not Muslim their kids are becoming atheists or they're going to another
(3:02:17) religion But again like I'm telling you even in Iran if you take away the law 50% of the population has already left
(3:02:24) Islam It's an old ideology Is getting exposed everywhere Believe me it's
(3:02:29) getting exposed everywhere And uh people are leaving faster like more than you guys actually think No that but don't
(3:02:36) you understand that doesn't contend with what he's saying so he's saying like listen nobody's saying people aren't
(3:02:41) leaving Islam in droves I agree right they're only keeping a sustainment rate due to new converts I completely agree
(3:02:47) with this But if it is the case that if you become a secularist you don't reproduce at the rate that they do it
(3:02:53) doesn't matter because you're a genetic dead end So even if all of you are leaving and you don't reproduce at the
(3:02:58) same rate that they do they still beat you Do you understand that like math it's just math right i totally
(3:03:05) understand But like I'm telling you even in Pakistan even with Islam the reproduction rate is dropping It's not
(3:03:12) how it was And if those people don't have babies cuz they're not following Islam then they're going to be
(3:03:18) reproductive dead ends and the Islamicists will continue to have babies Lady you're not understanding me Andrew
(3:03:23) I'm talking about even the Muslims are not having as Yes they are as they did
(3:03:29) before I know but they're having way more than the secularists Let me finish
(3:03:34) At least in Pakistan an average family will have two kids Don't talk about the Muslims in Western countries that are
(3:03:41) sitting on all these benefits that keep popping out kids because they know they're having five six kids because
(3:03:47) they know they're going to get welfare for it I'm not getting welfare That's why I don't have 10 kids That's another
(3:03:52) story what you're talking about that they're going to replace here Oh yeah I'm pretty sure that if the UK and the
(3:04:00) next one and I don't know about us but if they didn't So they win Your ideology is poison They win Your ideology is
(3:04:06) poison They're going to outproduce you They win You see that do you understand they
(3:04:11) win Like why don't you get that they win Hey Rod Alich what do you got what what's up
(3:04:19) go ahead I'm just saying what do you mean my ideology you know you atheism
(3:04:24) Atheism Then again see he's not going to let me talk If you don't want them you ask me a question If you don't want them
(3:04:31) to take over you need to have better laws I don't understand why people can
(3:04:36) come into Catholic countries or I will say secular democratic country but again against under secularism everybody's got
(3:04:43) to have free rights and stuff right you got to treat them the same way they treat you in their countries yeah I'm going to explain
(3:04:49) yeah okay fine you go to somebody pathy though it is you know there we have to
(3:04:57) kind of I'm just trying to like really quickly get through that I'm just telling you just a quick response it
(3:05:02) doesn't matter the math ain't math nothing because you're an atheist You can't make moral law claims for any of this You want equality egalitarianism If
(3:05:08) we have people who come in who are Muslims you got to treat them exactly the same with no religious distinction And you can't bar them You can't by your
(3:05:15) own ideology bar them So because of that they're going to come in They're going to outproduce you They're going to take over your [ __ ] nations is what
(3:05:21) they're doing right now They said their most powerful weapons of the womb It is What do you have you can't even tell
(3:05:26) women they have a duty to have kids Mach Go ahead
(3:05:32) See this is the thing Yes you can No you can You just have to have a strict laws and orders You know uh your I'm sorry to
(3:05:40) say your political leaders whoever they're just bending their asses backward You just treat them how they
(3:05:46) treat you in their country They don't give you all these You can give them right Yes you have the right to your
(3:05:51) mosque and to your home Don't pray outside you know Don't be giving them you know all these incentives Like why
(3:05:58) why do you think they're they are having more kids in the western countries than in Pakistan and because nobody's there
(3:06:05) the government's not giving their money to have kids but they have this here and oh my god this is perfect and this is
(3:06:10) the last thing I'll say the whole debate last thing I'll even say the whole debate so that James can get through this this is perfect you what you just
(3:06:16) did was you gave us a case that based around the fact that we could have bad results with certain people groups that
(3:06:22) we can bar them from doing things like voting and having participation in our nations that's the argument you just
(3:06:28) made against Islam It's perfect I love this [ __ ] Thank you for your concession
(3:06:34) lady Thank you for the concession Do you have a brain you're just like putting words in my mouth Like you're answering for me and understanding whatever you're
(3:06:40) saying Seriously that's not what I said I said you have to have certain restrictions That didn't mean that they
(3:06:46) couldn't vote They couldn't I'm talking about public display You have to go to You should not be You should not be
(3:06:52) incentivizing if you're going to be giving somebody like for example they're coming here They have three wives one
(3:06:57) legal wife the other two will claim single mom and then collect whatever uh child benefits that they are going to So
(3:07:04) these are the things that you need to look out for You guys are [ __ ] We've been on the same question for like 20
(3:07:09) minutes Let's go to the next one Less says "Not sure why you think it's some kind of quote unquote own to talk about
(3:07:17) to talk [ __ ] about Andrew debating 304s." Uh for those of you who are boomers like
(3:07:24) me that means these internet hoes the only fans girls on whatever they say
(3:07:29) After all he is debating you and Rachel would annihilate you No question Okay so
(3:07:35) two things One is like why are you criticizing Andrew because at least he's not being all uppety and saying he's not
(3:07:42) willing to debate the online uh prostitutes whatever you want to call them Oh no I have a huge respect for all
(3:07:50) these women uh that do that kind of work Okay but about Andrew and sex workers We know you respect prostitutes Great What
(3:07:57) about Andrew that's the question It's about Andrew Why are you criticizing Andrew for debating the people that you respect so much criticize him I said
(3:08:04) that you should bring all kinds of women but he hates those women That's what I'm saying He brings them to shame them
(3:08:09) there That's what he brings them for No I don't I don't I don't listen Unless you attack me I don't attack you Unless
(3:08:15) you attack me I don't attack you You're you're you're only doing that show is only for views This is what I don't like
(3:08:21) about that show is the same thing that you're criticizing You never watched anything but clips Admit it If all women
(3:08:27) if all women started being like "You want You will have no whatever show You will have no podcast You guys will go
(3:08:32) broke." Do you think I give it listen listen Do you think I give a [ __ ] my show on my podcast right I get massive
(3:08:40) views I have 6,000 live right now I'm not debating with some Only Fans 304 and
(3:08:45) I run high numbers whether I'm on whatever or not I'm a guest on that show If the whole thing was phased out and
(3:08:50) there was no more whatever podcast me and Brian would give each other a big high five Our work was done
(3:08:57) No but I'm just saying I have no problem with you talking to them but you bring them to insult them and that's how you get clicks We We both know how interest
(3:09:03) I insult people who insult me I insult people who insult me No you came here
(3:09:09) first thing you said was like "Oh my god this is you You go on attacking people You purposely attack you until you
(3:09:15) attacked me I didn't attack you till you attacked me You did This one from Jr
(3:09:20) Patriot Question for James Why do you fate your microphone to keep it from
(3:09:25) going soft very funny Hot dogs for sale says Ma Malich Where when in Canada did
(3:09:31) you take any public assistance for the business how much government money or grants did you take that white men are
(3:09:39) excluded from
(3:09:44) i have a mortgage If if you're talking about mortgage I did have to put money down but yeah No I didn't have to take
(3:09:50) any loan Not yet But if I do I'm eligible for it
(3:09:56) Did you come into Canada as a refugee i sir did Yes My mother Yeah So you were
(3:10:01) already a tax burden immediately Right away No I would say why am I a tax burden i've worked because the refugee
(3:10:06) process requires it Let me clear something out for you When we came here as a refugee it wasn't a free-for-all
(3:10:12) that's going on right now My mother got only for 6 months $700 to survival until
(3:10:18) she got herself Oh is that all hang on a second Hang on a second Okay We lived in
(3:10:23) a bachelor Then she went and did her studies and then she got a job It's not like the It's not like 3,3500 these
(3:10:30) refugees are giving now you know And since then I've worked All right we got to go to the next question Adjusted for inflation $700 when your mom was working
(3:10:36) A lot of money realize ma ma leachch asked if we could wrap up about this
(3:10:42) time So fudge Let me just read more Can't get to them all James You can't get to them all
(3:10:49) you know Let me just read this last one Spyro uh appreciate it They said "Malich
(3:10:54) between your voice and your utter idiocy I went and bought a ring to put around my neck and hang myself cuz holy hell
(3:11:01) there is one thing and Islam got right But be right back Got to go
(3:11:06) self-terminate this one from one and sell off this planet." Thank God
(3:11:11) I mean thank thank God Andrew JMP34 says "Mia Khalifa also just bragged about
(3:11:19) collecting rings." Just saying Is Mia Is Mia one of your friends
(3:11:26) no but she also shows men's hypocrisy Well no The ring thing was because you guys keep saying "Oh we hit the wall Oh
(3:11:32) we had this." Well then we show you that we're not We still have desperate people I'm not going to call them desperate We
(3:11:38) still have men interested in us Yeah You don't want to call them desperate That makes you look bad right now You don't want to call them desperate No no I'm
(3:11:44) not going to call them desperate Everybody wants somebody right and then again you just keep saying that oh women
(3:11:50) are not finding anybody And that's not that's not true You know it too This one from That's not true Anita Ben Patchy
(3:11:58) Apache says "Weird how people like this lady flee their country to come and immediately start scolding people because they are not more like the
(3:12:04) people she fled from in the first place." No seriously You think that I want
(3:12:11) people like Pakistan here i don't even know where this woman got it got this from Like did you even watch the show i
(3:12:17) don't want Andrew to turn into a Muslim Hell no That's This is why when I see so many similarities on women's rights in
(3:12:25) religion that's why I'm saying like no religious don't give any rights to women They don't like women's right It's a
(3:12:31) patriarchal system in there Yeah it is a patriarchal system to enforce women's rights It it does actually enforce
(3:12:36) women's rights The only thing that enforces women's rights is that you have men who can use force by your own
(3:12:42) admission It was like you're going to live in a patriarchy Like it or not sweetheart This one coming in from last one
(3:12:48) Appreciate it Ivan Jr says "Malich you're dumb ass You're you're like you're dumb as a
(3:12:57) grain of salt." Okay pardon me You went to exiting infrastructure in all caps
(3:13:05) running from the question because women have zero chance at surviving this harsh world When chaos erupts you will be
(3:13:12) seeking men for safety You still didn't answer No I will answer it again It's not only
(3:13:18) women It's men these days too that will also not survive given that half of them can't even cook because they want women
(3:13:25) to cook for them right because they can't even survive How are you guys going to survive you can't even feed yourself right you need women to cook
(3:13:31) for you So no this again it's the best cooks in the world are men not women Again again you're interrupting You're
(3:13:36) assuming that women won't be able to survive There's a lot of women that will be able to survive And if they won't do
(3:13:42) that you won't either The best cooks in the world are men not women The best The very best are men Then why do you have a
(3:13:50) problem cooking at home exactly my point No men don't have a problem cooking at home I grill constantly I love it I
(3:13:55) think it's great I can feed myself fine What are you talking about why is there such a big deal about making me a sandwich get in the kitchen Why you guys
(3:14:02) are the ones coming up with it It's because of the practicality of the skill set when applied to society You at the
(3:14:09) same time you [ __ ] about how oh my god you want women to get in the kitchen have a whole job where your job is to be
(3:14:14) in the [ __ ] kitchen It's ironically hilarious Yeah
(3:14:20) So my job could be something else too Why Why can't I be an owner of a restaurant just because I own a
(3:14:26) restaurant ask me but you're not Telling women that they need to stay The thing that's so funny about this is like when
(3:14:31) you look at women's occupations the same [ __ ] that they gravitated towards pre-suffrage it's all the same stuff
(3:14:37) School teachers and nurses and healthcare and cooking it's the same [ __ ] Bartendes it's the same stuff Yeah
(3:14:45) The only difference is our wages go to us now not our husbands Thank you I do want to let Malach I know does have a
(3:14:51) time limit where she did want to make sure that she got out of here by about a few hours So I do want to keep that promise So I do want to say uh we do
(3:14:58) appreciate both guests for real I know that I s I probably seem pissed off tonight but we really do appreciate them
(3:15:04) Click on their links folks Even if you disagree with them you might as well go harass them then at their links but you
(3:15:11) could also learn just by going to their links because there's a lot of value where you get to read it or hear it

(3:16:41) little Zoom call here so you can see me again And I want to say thank you for your support of Modern Day Debate We uh
(3:16:46) it was a lively one tonight and it was uh Wow I don't know what to say That one
(3:16:52) was like uh more controversial than usual more lively more but I'm excited and I just
(3:16:59) appreciate your support Thank you guys So I'm going to quick update the description box as our guest asked I
(3:17:05) basically asked if I could put any links in there for them additional links and I do want to keep that promise But in the
(3:17:11) meantime want to say thanks for being with us Uh if you haven't yet we do hit
(3:17:17) it We appreciate hit that like button Seriously it means more than you know As
(3:17:23) if you thought your side was more persuasive tonight you're like "Hey yeah I actually did." Well a great way to
(3:17:29) make more people see your side be more persuasive tonight is by hitting the
(3:17:34) like button for real because that means YouTube will recommend it to more people And I do actually believe it makes a difference I've looked at the YouTube
(3:17:40) analytics for years It's been about six uh and a half years that Modern Day debate has been going So it's close to
(3:17:47) this fall will be seven full years a number of uh completeness and I'm not
(3:17:52) hinting at anything like being done We are just getting started at modern day bait which means you should hit that
(3:17:59) subscribe button as we have got big things planned for the future We are excited about the future We are doing
(3:18:05) big things including in Los Angeles Starting this summer we are planning our own Jubilee style
(3:18:12) debate series called Outnumbered And we
(3:18:18) are planning on having the first guest one of which will be surrounded by
(3:18:23) 50 different critics be Andrew Wilson So
(3:18:29) hope you're excited for that as we are excited to launch this new type of video series And thank you guys for your
(3:18:36) support And Daniel J says "Have you made arrangements for ancient day debate yet
(3:18:41) heard you're going to have a debate con in the fall." Ha that's funny Thanks Tyler Conway for your prayers I
(3:18:46) appreciate that That means a lot I know I looked uh maybe a little bit brooding tonight
(3:18:53) but I can assure you we are going to persevere We are excited about the
(3:18:58) future Modern Databate has a bright future So like I said we are grateful that we have hit 200,000 subscribers
(3:19:05) 217,000 to be exact Thank you for your support Thank you for being subscribers
(3:19:10) This is just the beginning of our story We are determined to provide a neutral
(3:19:16) platform so everybody can make their case on a level playing field We are a barreling locomotive
(3:19:23) going down the tracks and no matter what gets in modern day way we are going to keep on barreling through So want to say
(3:19:31) thank you for your support Thank you guys for everything I do appreciate it We do have a Wednesday debate Uh this
(3:19:38) one is going to be hosted by Ryan So we do appreciate Ryan Uh huge help to the
(3:19:43) channel He's going to be back for the first time in like a month Um it's just been so busy that I've been Yeah So uh
(3:19:51) let's see Even Lord says "Are you still looking for a leftist debater between Chicago and Detroit?" Uh well unfortunately that we probably aren't
(3:19:57) going to do that as we had planned We are probably going to instead do that
(3:20:02) event in Los Angeles We were going to do that in that area between Los Angeles or sorry between Chicago and Detroit But
(3:20:10) then we got to a point where we're like you know what we should just set up our hub in Los Angeles Especially because I
(3:20:16) just moved to Las Vegas So it's like a three-hour more like a 4h hour drive to
(3:20:21) Los Angeles from here And so for me it's like hey that's actually pretty convenient and it's a major metro area
(3:20:28) And so yeah we're going to start doing our own debate series called outnumbered It's going to be a lot like
(3:20:34) Jubilee's surrounded series and Andrew Wilson's going to be the first guest So
(3:20:39) we're excited about that It's going to be the summer and it is going to be so big you won't even believe it And we're
(3:20:45) actually going to try to sell some very affordable economical tickets So something like uh if people want to
(3:20:51) watch something cheap you know like 20 bucks and they can come watch the filming and it's going to be epic We're
(3:20:59) really excited about it We're also going to make it in my opinion better than
(3:21:04) Jubilee We are kind of adding some gamification uh just some kind of cool things that
(3:21:09) like kind of like Sports [Music] Centerish touches to the show So we're
(3:21:15) excited about that But want to say thanks for your kind kind words Tyler Conway says "Let's go MDD." Thanks for your kind words Tyler Seriously if I'm
(3:21:21) ever cranky toward anybody in the chat I know there are a couple people that I was like bringing the hammer on pretty hard tonight
(3:21:27) [Music] Um please don't take it personally and I'm going to try to be a little bit more
(3:21:34) friendly in those rare cases where I'm sometimes not super friendly Daniel J says "Soon MD is going to have millions
(3:21:40) of subscribers and we'll be able to say we've been we've been there when it was just a couple hundred
(3:21:47) thousand." I believe you're right Daniel J For real I love Modern 88 and actually right now though I'm teaching uh this is
(3:21:54) my last semester as a professor So I'm teaching remotely for M's level uh
(3:22:01) students And while I love the students and I love
(3:22:06) teaching I love modern day bait way more It's way more fun So I'm actually planning on going full-time with modern
(3:22:12) day debate and I'm no longer going to be a professor So that's going to be great I'm excited about the future And I want
(3:22:19) to say though again thanks for all your support and we will see you at the next
(3:22:24) debate This Wednesday it's going to be Jake Oh have I put this event up yet yeah Yeah Yeah Jake of Rattlesnake TV
(3:22:31) He's going to be debating Craig the Atheist on secular humanism versus
(3:22:36) Christianity What is better for society and then probably in a couple weeks out First Amender will be taking on Rachel
(3:22:43) Wilson Maybe we can set up Rachel with uh Malach That'd be an interesting one
(3:22:48) But yeah Yeah Want to say thanks guys Uh thanks for being channel members as well Even Lord thanks for being a channel
(3:22:54) member And Jeff Bros and Wilar thank you for being channel members Hannah Anderson thanks for being a channel mod

(3:23:14) being subscribers Appreciate you guys Batman Inc Thank you for being a based
(3:23:19) moderator in addition to Hannah and Yeah Yeah So yeah uh this is uh my professor stint
(3:23:30) is being it's shortlived because I'm just there's like so much opportunity with modern day debate We've got to go
(3:23:35) for it So that's why I'm taking the leap and burning the votes Not really burning
(3:23:41) I could go back to being a professor but I I just don't want to Thanks everybody
