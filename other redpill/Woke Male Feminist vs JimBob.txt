(1:31) good for society each of the debaters will have a five-minute opening
(1:36) statement and then the rest of the show will be open conversation and there will be some breaks for messages from the
(1:43) audience uh Oliver you get the opening statement so go ahead awesome well thank you very much Brian for having me on the
(1:49) show and thank you Jim Bob for uh being here and agreeing to have this debate and I look forward to having a productive exchange of ideas um so the
(1:55) resolution we're debating as Brian uh mentioned was um is feminism good for society and I'll be arguing in the affirmative that yes feminism has been
() 
(2:02) good for society and will continue to be good for society before we dive in I think it's important to clarify how
(2:08) we're defining feminism or how I'm defining feminism in this debate since definitions matter in any productive conversation to ensure we're not talking
(2:15) past one another uh the version of feminism I'll be defending is the belief that individuals should have the same
(2:20) rights opportunities and basic respect um and should be given equal opportunities to succeed and not be
(2:26) prevented from doing so on the basis of their sex or gender now notice what this definition does not say it doesn't claim
(2:32) that there must be equal outcomes in every field one common straw man of feminism is that feminism demands strict
(2:38) 50/50 representation in every field plumbers electricians brick layers garbage collectors doctors members of
(2:45) Congress and so on that's not what I'm arguing for and that's not really what any feminist is really arguing for
(2:51) feminism doesn't seek to erase all difference and disparities but what it does seek to do is remove the unjust
(2:57) barriers that often prevent women from entering or advancing in certain fields due to bias discrimination or certain
(3:03) expectations of what a man or woman's proper role is another term worth defining because I think it's going to
(3:08) come up a decent amount is patriarchy patriarchy is typically understood as a system that advantages men over women
(3:13) granting them primary power across nearly all domains of society so political leadership moral authority
(3:19) even epistemic authority the idea that a man's knowledge or judgment should be inherently trusted more and control over
(3:25) things like property and wealth as with feminism there are many straw man arguments surrounding patriarchy so let
(3:30) me address a common one some argue that if men are suffering whether it's because they dominate in dangerous jobs
(3:36) or are more likely to be victims of violent crime or of higher suicide rates just to name a few examples then
(3:41) patriarchy must not exist but this misunderstands what patriarchy means the existence of male suffering does not
(3:47) disprove patriarchy because patriarchy refers to who holds power not who experiences hardship while men are
(3:53) absolutely harmed by many aspects of the patriarchal system the people in positions of authority and control over
(3:59) remain overwhelmingly male so yes patriarchy can and does harm men as well but it systematically privileges men in
(4:06) ways that it does not for women i have several concrete examples of how our society functions in a patriotic way or
(4:11) patriotic patriarchal way and I'm happy to share those if needed but from what I understand of Jim Bob's previously
(4:17) articulated positions although maybe that's not what we're operating under he doesn't deny that patriarchy exists in fact he appears to embrace it as a good
(4:23) and natural thing so at least for the purpose of this debate it seems unnecessary to spend time proving that patriarchy exists so we can instead move
(4:30) on to a more substantive question which is rather should it exist um so and this
(4:35) is going to be the claim of this debate I think largely is whether patriarchy should exist in some capacity um
(4:40) something I've seen Jim Bob do in previous debates is embrace what I view to be another straw man of patriarchy in
(4:46) which it defines he defines it narrowly as the idea that men serve as the enforcement arm of society that only men
(4:53) can uphold law and order and because they are on average physically better equipped for physical enforcement they
(4:59) must have this authority but this view is not only reductive it's historically and sociologically incoherent patriarchy
(5:06) is not simply who can win in a fist fight it's about who writes the laws sets the norms controls the institutions
(5:12) and decides whose voices are taken seriously reducing patriarchy to brute strength is like explaining corporate
(5:17) power by saying CEOs have authority over their companies because they can beat up the interns in reality power is much
(5:25) more upheld by um it's upheld by much more than muscle it's reinforced through
(5:30) tr through tradition ideology religion economic control and legal structures
(5:35) the force doctrine idea here strips patriarchy of its complexity and reimagines it as this caveman logic of
(5:41) might makes right which is not only inaccurate but pretty intellectually lazy the major point I want to make in
(5:48) my opening is this you're going to hear a lot of claims made from Jim Bob about how feminism has supposedly led to a
(5:54) wide array of disastrous outcomes declining birth rates labor market saturation and wage wage stagnation
(6:00) rising divorce rates initiated by women and much more for every claim he makes I urge you to ask has he actually
(6:07) demonstrated that feminism caused these outcomes or have they merely occurred alongside the rise of feminism because
(6:14) one of the most common fallacies I see from anti-feminists is treating correlation as causation yes feminism
(6:20) has grown so is the gap between the rich and poor yes feminism has grown and the birth rate has declined but that's not
(6:26) evidence of causation to those who accept that line of reasoning I'll remind you that there's a strong correlation between per capita margarine
(6:33) consumption and the divorce rate in Maine or between the number of Nicholas Cage films released in a given year and
(6:38) the number of accidental drownings in swimming pools my point is this the burden is on Jim Bob to prove that
(6:43) feminism caused these trends not merely that they happened alongside one another and I will argue against this that these
(6:49) societal shifts are are a result of broader economic cultural and technological forces that are caused by
(6:55) a combination of many other factors but feminism is not one of them i won't just
(7:01) refute Jim Bob's claims that feminism has has been an overall negative for society i will also affirmatively make
(7:06) the case that feminism has been a force for tremendous good higher GDP in countries that have greater labor force
(7:12) population driven in large part by expanded opportunities for women which can be directly linked to more people
(7:17) using their talents to contribute to the economy and society countries like Norway Sweden and Finland which have
(7:23) fostered more egalitarian systems and removed many barriers women face in both work and public life consistently show
(7:29) higher levels of prosperity and innovation and we see similar gains in productivity output numerous studies
(7:34) have shown that gender diverse teams perform better a Princeton University study examining over 6 million research
(7:40) papers found teams that composed of both men and women produced more novel and influential work specifically
(7:46) mixedgender teams were nearly 10% more likely to publish novel research and over 30% more likely to be highly cited
(7:54) compared to single gender teams and that's not just this you know feel-good rhetoric about diversity it's measurable
(7:59) concrete benefits of greater gender inclusion in the sciences and society at large i'll wrap it up here as I'm sure
(8:06) we'll explore many of these specifics further as the debate progresses but I will as I will continue to demonstrate
(8:11) the case is abundantly clear feminism has has had a profoundly positive impact on society and we must push back firmly
(8:19) and unapologetically against those who seek to drag us backwards thank you all
(8:24) right Jim Bob all right go with your open thank you so much all right the debate is is feminism
() 
(8:31) good for society uh Oliver uh defined feminism as individuals having the same
(8:37) rights equal opportunities in the world uh so on and so forth um I would argue
(8:42) that society we have to define society real quick society is an aggregate of people living in an ordered uh system an
(8:49) ordered community i want to focus on that word ordered for a second because without any order uh without any force
(8:57) without any threat of force you really don't have a society so when when Oliver says equal rights equal this equal that
(9:04) well it's descriptively the case that it's not equal because women uh
(9:09) regardless of how much they want inequality it's always enforced by men which is an inequality so there's an
(9:16) irony there that feminism uh fights for equality but relies on inequality um so
(9:22) looking at some key components of what makes a society uh if you argue a society is good because of this reason
(9:28) it needs these components law and order is one of the components which I can't stress enough um without it you have
(9:35) nothing uh if you don't if if he assumes rights that assumes law if you assume
(9:40) law that assumes force so when Oliver says he reduces it to force everything
(9:45) Oliver listed in his opening whether or not you thought it sounded good the only
(9:50) thing that's operating ultimately is force if men decide not to give those
(9:56) things to women they can do that if men decide to give those things to women they can do that uh essentially feminism
(10:03) is a set of grievances and requests a lot like a child in the room asking for more toys and then arguing for equality
(10:10) and calling uh the moment where the dad gives them the toys they call that equality it's pretty much like a a LAR
(10:17) um obligations and duties is a key one oliver even uh in his uh counter to my
(10:23) reduction of the force doctrine he included something called traditions right well uh obligations and duties is
(10:30) not something that feminism can provide at all um feminism just has this major assumption of equality that is in fact
(10:37) an outcome um so there is no equality of opportunity even among men so why would
(10:42) there be equality of opportunity among men and women obligations and duties is a key feature because the vision that
(10:49) Oliver has and many feminists have for society they have a vision that the world's a certain way where women and
(10:56) men are doing all of these things together but the reality is the operation of the world the society
(11:01) itself including the hardest manual labor jobs which he listed uh building bridges tunnels uh managing the sewer
(11:08) system suddenly the feminist assumes that the men have a an obligation to
(11:14) keep these things going let's say the men decided to stop all of that work for a second they actually do it during
(11:19) strikes that's leverage right so the men actually descriptively do have the power
(11:25) i am not one of those oppositional uh uh people to feminism arguing that the
(11:30) patriarchy doesn't exist the patriarchy does exist because it's descript it's descriptive of reality it can't not
(11:36) exist uh in other words for feminism to do what it wants to do it actually
(11:41) appeals to the patriarchy it doesn't negate it so for instance if feminism is
(11:47) a movement away from men in power let's say power is this this is men and women
(11:52) are here the idea is that we lower the men's power or we elevate the women's
(11:58) power the problem is it's a request it's a request so if feminism is a movement away from the men in power and women's
(12:06) rights let's say is a feminist movement why is it the case that women don't give themselves the rights it's men who give
(12:14) them the rights so if everything they're asking for under this feminist movement is a request from the power they're
(12:21) actually affirming the patriarchy um so that that's a good question for Oliver
(12:26) to ask uh answer during the back and forth why don't women just give themselves the rights why don't they
(12:31) just give it to themselves well because they can't because collectively women can't uh take rights and they can't
(12:37) protect their own rights but yet in the same breath they're they're demanding these rights but they have no obligation
(12:43) that's not equality so if feminism is about equality um I'm pointing out one very uh important aspect of society
(12:51) where equality can't possibly exist nor would I want it to exist i would I want
(12:56) the men in power and if you press uh especially women you'll see on this podcast a lot of times when you press
(13:02) them on this issue they actually concede that they'd rather have men in these power positions keeping society going uh
(13:08) I want to go back to leverage for a second um what does the woman have for leverage
(13:14) for instance let's look at voting for a second so when men collectively vote
(13:20) they're basically saying something they're saying "I'm not going to group up with other men and overthrow the
(13:26) government." They're basically communicating I'm forfeiting my will to
(13:31) gather other like-minded men get our guns and throw a rebellion in exchange
(13:37) I'm going to vote well when a woman votes what are they leveraging what are they exchanging there's nothing on the
(13:42) table for them to exchange i would argue the the only leverage women actually
(13:47) have in a society is their chastity is their ability to have children which is
(13:52) an extreme value i would argue it's one of the most valuable things women could
(13:58) uh appeal to in their in their political exchanges uh which leads me to the third
(14:03) part people you need people for a society yes uh reducing birth rates is a
(14:09) a very uh important topic whether you blame it on feminism or anything else it's right in front of us so the
(14:15) question I would have if feminism was good for society how is it that feminism doesn't advocate for children for women
(14:22) to be mothers for for women to be in the home raising the next generation of children after all a society is made of
(14:29) people and what good is a good society if it doesn't have good people so the question tonight um is for for Oliver to
(14:38) confront these fundamental issues the core issues and I would argue that there's uh feminism is essentially in in
(14:44) a kind of a performative contradiction it says in one hand that they want
(14:49) equality right but they have no obligations they say they say in the same sentence that they want rights but
(14:56) they have no obligation or ability to even defend their rights so to claim you want these things and this is fair
(15:02) you're already smuggling in that there there is a group of men who have to or
(15:07) should be obligated to protect you defend you so I'd ask Oliver uh and it'll come up tonight do men have an
(15:15) obligation to protect women do men have an obligation to enforce law do men have
(15:20) an obligation to fight even in wars to defend so-called rights well the same
(15:26) obligation can't be made for women because they're collectively incapable which is why you'll never see in the
(15:32) history of humanity a time where women gave themselves the rights if they could have given themselves the rights they
(15:38) wouldn't be asking the patriarchy to do it um so yes I affirm the patriarchy of course but the question isn't whether a
(15:45) patriarchy is good for society because societies can't exist without the patriarchy it's a necessary argument
(15:51) whereas uh Oliver is tasked tonight to tell us me and you and Brian and
(15:56) everyone watching why is feminism good for society i would say it's overall not
(16:02) good for society for a variety of reasons one of which is the messaging for feminism has largely been uh sexual
(16:10) liberation for women women acting more like shitty men honestly like that that's liberating um promiscuity um that
(16:18) that's some sort of liberation policy for for feminism they're right about one thing though their leverage is sex their
(16:26) leverage is birth the the ability to give birth and be be a mother the the
(16:31) problem with feminism is that it's inverted the power that women have their sexuality their womb it's inverted it
(16:38) and used convinced them to use that uh advantage against themselves and we're
(16:44) looking at it you know women are more in debt was it a good thing to shove all the women to the workforce you think
(16:50) you're empowered until you're 40 and and you have three cats and wine stained teeth and you have no husband or
(16:55) children or legacy and then you're you're dying to be invited to a wedding so you can talk to some groomsmen this
(17:02) is not empowering we have to reverse this we have to reverse it soon it's not just a an issue of uh societal collapse
(17:09) but it's a it's a it's an issue of morality as well which I hope we get into of course yeah absolutely okay well
(17:17) open conversation now yeah just open conversation so I'll just go ahead absolutely i'd love to kind of get into
(17:22) this idea of the force doctrine kind of I want to like just kind of make sure we have a mutual understanding there so is
(17:28) your view that um that the force doctrine is the idea that the patriarchy itself is inevitable because because men
(17:34) possess greater physical strength generally than women that they can at any time impose their will upon women
() 
(17:40) yes they can impose their will on women and men sure okay okay so I'm I guess I'm wondering even if we grant you know
(17:47) this idea that men are stronger than women generally um does like potential equate to actual like do you think that
(17:53) that is kind of a general like idea that we can operate off of like what could be the case is what should define how
(17:59) things are right now well I would use more of like induction it's always been the case and it seems to be always the
(18:05) case similar to the sun rising okay um that men overall are going to be the
(18:11) ones enforcing and defending um offending defending and there's never
(18:16) been a case where women actually grant themselves the so-called rights that they're asking for or take those rights
(18:24) so it goes both ways men can activate their force take things from people men
(18:29) could activate their force and defend that people have things too now feminism is the latter so the question is can
(18:36) women collectively overtake the patriarchy i mean I think they
() 
(18:41) technically could i mean so I think when we're talking about what could happen we're talking about hypothetical things
(18:46) so the entirety of men I don't think will ever agree on like enslaving women
(18:53) just like every single person there's always going to be some men that oppose them of course there's going to be you know maybe those men might win out in
(18:59) certain scenarios but there's always going to be some men that are against them so we're never going to have a situation where all men are trying to
(19:05) enslave women so when I'm thinking about this and I thought about this hypothetical and I think it was brought up on a previous podcast episode women
(19:11) could hypothetically um as you talked about leverage the fact that they give birth and either kill themselves or kill
(19:17) their male offspring and if they did that and if they collectively did that then they would have that power right
(19:23) they leverage that well if if they can do that men could hypothetically counter that by using force to stop that from
(19:30) happening right i'm not sure i you know I I I think that if people want to end end a pregnancy if people want to end
(19:35) their own lives they are very determined to do that and I would be I don't I don't think but if it came down to force
(19:41) right oh if it came down to force sorry yes if it came down to force the woman would have a tougher the collection of
(19:48) women who you convince to uh you know work against their own existence and their children's existence which is
(19:54) pretty close to feminism already um men could actually step in right and and and
(19:59) reverse that for instance uh you know abortion is a perfect example of it women are fighting for the right to
(20:07) terminate their own children right legally safely is that a good thing i mean not in my view yeah i'm pro-choice
(20:12) that's a good thing so it's already a good thing so your hypothetical was well there could be a moment where women
(20:17) start terminating their own children i'm saying they're already doing that in the millions wait no no they they do they do
(20:22) that legally but what happens when abortion is illegal what's legal though no no no but that that that goes to my
(20:28) point Oliver what does what does legal assume though well that it is permitted
(20:33) by society and permitted and if it wasn't permitted women would do it anyway so hold on a second no no that's
(20:39) not that's not the point the point is when you say legal you're appealing to force doctrine i'm not I'm not denying
(20:46) that there is some role of enforcement in society nothing anything legal
(20:51) assumes the patriarchy so that's the this is what I'm this is what in my opening statement Oliver I want you to get is anything you think is good for
(20:58) women as a permission of behavior is going to be permitted and allowed by a
(21:04) collection of men with guns sure so my question would be because you're defining patriarchy as the that is the
(21:10) fact that men will always need to enforce things that men always need to I think that is a poor definition of
(21:16) patriarchy because what else would it be though okay well I I kind of gave a a a definition at the beginning here this
(21:22) idea that it is a general um general idea that men hold more societal
(21:28) institutional power things of that nature they they write the laws they create the norms and the systems that
(21:34) goes beyond just mere brute force it really is because think think about this
(21:39) why don't the workers of a company just on a whim all the time overthrow the CEO
(21:45) because it's illegal because of men well sure but they could if every single or do you think there are more people technically of the working class that if
(21:52) they got together they could overthrow the CEO if there was no uh legality to
(21:58) it like when you say CEO and company hold on hold on when you say CEO and company you're already assuming law
(22:04) again so you're using these terms I know but Oliver you're using terms and distinctions that are that necessitate
(22:11) that law already exists right that the force application already exists i'm arguing from your from your perspective
(22:17) it's better for you to say the patriarchy is good for feminism why
(22:22) because whatever you call feminism requires the patriarchy so this would be an argument that's equivalent to saying
(22:28) like having a like militaristic authoritarian government is good for
(22:34) democracy well that's that's a good thing well no democracy democracy is democracy itself
(22:41) actually could produce authoritative governments well no no it can i'm correct but would you say that because it is technically possible for the
(22:48) military to overtake the democratic government that democracy itself doesn't exist no I'm saying democracy itself
(22:55) requires the force sure but the will people voting doesn't actually matter
(23:00) it's here i'll ask it a different way can you give me a hypothetical of where a kind of feminism could exist in the
(23:07) vision you have but doesn't require the collective of men using force to protect
(23:12) it um I think there could be examples where women have superior technology
(23:18) where the ones that they're able to you know if if they have a majority of the weapons we can imagine this builds weapons I mean mostly why does it matter
() 
(23:25) who necessarily I just hold on it matters Oliver because I asked you can you give me a hypothetical where women
(23:32) could express their feminism and exist in a feminist society or whatever you are envisioning without the the men the
(23:39) men are building these weapons because the men have always built the weapons No because No no it's not because you're
(23:45) appealing to the past to justify what's happening there do you own a weapon what do you own a weapon like a firearm okay
(23:50) yeah no I don't have a firearm okay so larger weaponry even a firearm uh the
(23:56) majority of a a large portion of women can't even [ __ ] a gun they can't clean a
(24:01) gun they can't hold on they can't break Hold on they can't break down a gun okay and they can't carry larger equipment so
(24:08) if you're arguing that the great equalizer is military equipment from small to large that takes brute strength
(24:15) not only to make but to ma uh maintain and to transport and you're basically
(24:20) granting yourself that you're just saying like look Santa came it wasn't the men who actually engineered and and
(24:26) moved these large things around for us to use right uh remote control bombing and whatnot all these missile silos and
(24:32) whatnot this requires massive amount of brute strength right you're just granting yourself the fruits of the
(24:39) brute strength in the hypothetical and saying "Well it could be the case that women could just find a pile of missiles
(24:46) in the woods and then it's the great equalizer." That's not the argument i'm saying without men how what does a woman
(24:53) What does a collection of women do to sustain their What does a collection of weaker men do without stronger men no
(25:00) that's I'm arguing for the stronger men okay so then your argument is basically that whoever is the strongest man out
(25:07) there who whoever has the most brute power right there they are the ones who dictate society dictate society so you
(25:15) are grateful then to men who are stronger than you you are grateful to men that are stronger than you for
() 
(25:20) enforcing it so why should you necessarily have rights i don't believe
(25:25) in rights okay i mean so why then why should your to vote be protect why should I don't believe in vote i don't
(25:31) think I don't think I should vote necessarily but certainly not women because if you remember in my opener would you agree that when a collective
(25:38) of uh very strong men stronger than me and you right the big the big burly ones with the crosseyed
(25:43) right if they don't vote would you agree that the alternative to voting would be
(25:48) just rebellion or brute force if they didn't agree with the government the government i mean I think it still is they can vote and they can still use
(25:54) brute force voting is kind of I'm saying that when I'm I'm not saying they could vote i'm not saying they can't vote and
(26:01) then suddenly be like you know what I know I voted but I'm going to still do this i'm saying generally speaking the
(26:06) act of voting for men collectively aren't they saying I'm not going to
(26:11) rebel i don't think they're necessarily saying they're not going to rebel they're saying that I would prefer not to i think I think I can get what I want
(26:19) by not using Fair enough i'll grant you that it's just that if they prefer not to I'm saying that the alternative is
(26:25) that they could right sure okay women if you switch it over to women if women
(26:31) they all start voting right mhm what are they forfeiting what do you mean what are they forfeiting if the man is
(26:37) forfeiting I don't think he is he is he He's basically saying "I'm going to vote and I'm going to hope that the
(26:44) outsourced uh force application uh which is the military and the justice system
(26:49) and everything else included right they're outsourcing their brute force now if they disagree and they decide
(26:56) voting isn't for you anymore and you're going to start a rebellion they could do that what I'm asking you Oliver is can
(27:01) women do that i don't necessarily think that I don't like most women can but I
(27:06) don't think most men can either i don't think most men can what you're what you're doing is you're ascribing the
(27:12) quality of brute force to all men because they're a member of the category no it's um I am actually appealing to
(27:18) categories i'm saying when it comes to categories right it's like saying this like are you in a category of of beings
(27:25) that can think and do logic can all human beings do logic not
(27:31) necessarily no but I'm appeal I'm appealing to to to the ones that can are in a certain category what I'm saying is
(27:37) that category Oliver is men no no not necessarily it's never a collection of women no no it could be young men why
(27:42) should old men get rights because young men are the ones that are defending them no no it's not it's not that who gets
(27:48) rights i You're You're making an argument you're the one affirming rights i'm not right your whole view on
(27:54) feminism my counter to feminism isn't about rights i don't even believe in rights okay your view is that women have
(28:01) rights that's good i'm asking you well why isn't why isn't it the case you think Oliver that women gave themselves
(28:08) the right to vote why did they appeal to another body of people to get the right to vote because they're the ones who
(28:14) controlled society like I don't really know what but I don't you're basically making a ma like a massive just is ought
(28:21) distinction is the case therefore I didn't say ought i didn't say ought then I can agree with your entire descriptive
(28:26) claim and say yeah then that's how we should yeah but if it's descriptively true that the ones you're going to be
(28:34) appealing to from the woman's perspective is always a collection of strong men then your argument that uh
(28:41) that you're making the norormative statement that we ought to pursue feminism that it's good for society what
(28:46) I'm saying is that anything you call feminism actually affirms the patriarchy no because you're defining patriarchy in
(28:53) terms of the enforcement arm that could be it's not because it's not because patriarchy as I talked about before is a
(28:59) is is a bunch of different things together okay I'm happy to go up one at a time okay I'm happy to do that um it's
(29:05) it's it's typically understood as a system that advantages men over women granting them primary access across all
(29:11) domains stop there one at a time okay is brute strength an advantage over women
(29:17) it not necessarily it can be but it not always is the case okay is it a
(29:24) advantage over women it can be but not all men are stronger than all women i understand but generally speaking if
(29:30) there's a collection of men and a collection of women and there's the same amount of each it's going to be the case that the collection of men even if
(29:37) they're weak men are going to be stronger than the women right true however No no but you're next on the list no no but you're This is important
(29:43) you're assuming that all the men will necessarily agree to impose their will i'm not talking about what they're
(29:48) agreeing i'm saying they could not whe whether they agree women could kill their children it doesn't matter that's
(29:54) not That's Then you don't have a society okay cool so everyone could pursue their own self-interest society would implode
(30:00) and where are we that's we're at liberalism that's what feminism is pursuing your own self-interest and your
(30:05) wants that's what you trained women to do under feminism pursue your individualism there's no greater
(30:11) obligation for women like for instance under feminism is there any obligation to have children uh no there's no
(30:17) obligation for men to have children either having children is not an obligation it depends on the worldview but generally just being a man yes
(30:24) you're not obligated this is why the ought which is your affirmative tonight does require a metaethical position
(30:31) right okay that's what I'm getting to so under your view if it's the case that feminism doesn't have an ought to have
(30:37) children yes is it a society better let's say there was a society without feminism but it had the it it didn't
(30:44) affirm your idea of feminism but it produced an ought statement of obligation to have children is that
(30:50) society better than the feminist one no well if it survives is it better not
(30:55) necessarily i don't think a society surviving in which women have zero rights and or zero you know are not well
(31:01) off what's a right what can you define a right um an entitlement entitlement so
(31:07) are there any um if an entitlement is that given to someone a large sense yeah
() 
(31:13) men and women it's given to them who gives women entitlements society well that's pretty vague well it
(31:20) is society we as a society decide on which hold on let's give it let's look at the let's look at the 19th amendment
(31:26) for a second okay when women started screaming some of them the minority by
(31:31) the way were started screaming for the the right to vote right who were they screaming to to give them the right to
(31:37) vote people in who were in power were men but you you're just making a statement that that was the case I'm
(31:42) asking you why do they appeal to the men in power and not just give themselves rights because those are the people that
(31:49) are in power you're asking they were excluded from being in power so when is it where women will be in the power
(31:55) position where men are asking women for rights uh when there are women who are
(32:00) in power do you think wait a second if if if there is a female CEO and a and a man walks into her office and it's like
(32:06) I would like a raise is he not asking her to grant him some sort of privilege
(32:12) or some sort of benefit absolutely yeah but this is this is not the same category as a raise because the raise
(32:19) doesn't depend ult well actually it does it depends ultimately on force which has which appeals to men so the question for
(32:25) you Oliver was this on people it appears to people who have the ability people who have yeah people have the ability to
(32:32) force to to enforce unjust or just laws so when you want a just law when when a
(32:39) bunch of women right when they wanted the right to vote they were asking other
(32:44) people to give them the right to vote that's how all rights work i understand rights work because they're enforced by
(32:51) brute by brute force every time yeah the there requires enforcement so I don't So
(32:57) all men don't enforce i know it's not about all men it's that the fact that the people enforcing are going to be
(33:03) predominantly men and if they were predominantly women they couldn't enforce it let's switch it for a second
(33:08) hold on let's switch it again men want the power the right to vote right let's switch it switch the history right men
(33:14) want the right to vote mhm the enforcement are are women as you see them today not as we say today if we
(33:21) want to flip the entirety of history no no wait a second if we We're not changing We're not all us equal no no no you can't do that because that's not how
(33:27) society develops that's how a hypothetical works no but you can't change the hypothetical and not change the relevant variables we would have to
(33:32) have society exist so that women over the entire course of history had built everything had excluded I didn't say I
(33:39) didn't say men are women i'm I'm saying in this instance in this instance okay
(33:44) right well that's the thing is you're actually agreeing with me that throughout history why is it that men
(33:49) with the brute force built all of the things like everything you see right all of the big skyscrapers the tunnels the
(33:56) bridges underwater welders all of these things are you going to are you going to say that it just happens to be a social
(34:03) construct that it happened to be men or is that a feature of biology so first off I think that there's this general
(34:08) idea that men built societ society and that that that that we should that that women did not play an integral or
(34:14) fundamental role to say that no no but hold on just let him finish yeah no you're good it's fine it's I'm I'm fine
(34:20) with the back and forth but yeah so it's all good yeah so I'm what I'm saying here is that there there were women who
(34:26) made very important advancements in almost every part of a um every part of
(34:31) advancement of infrastructure advancement of industry that you just don't know about have some examples you'd like me to bring up wait no no an
(34:37) advancement is that a an idea i mean sure we can talk about individual
(34:42) there's a straw man no I didn't say they're not important i didn't say women can't think of cool things all right
(34:48) we're talking about society let's say this city we're in right now it's maintained it's erected maintained by
(34:56) mostly men sure operating on what brute force not just brute force organization
(35:02) and SIPs and ideas it's based on ideas that's fine but without without the
(35:07) brute force you can't have the management of the roads for instance this is why I talk about leverage okay
() 
(35:13) men who run the city who actually use their force and their will to get under in tunnels and get dirty and die doing
(35:20) these things right to maintain if they suddenly said "No I'm not doing this." Do you really think women could just
(35:26) step in and do all the same work no and I think that if women collectively decided they're not going to have children and kill themselves men could
(35:33) and have the children so then this is an equivalent thing women and men can both withhold something that is essential
(35:39) that they provide to society oliver you agree with me the the opening statement that I that I made was this the leverage
(35:47) women have the important aspect of women in society is being mothers and raising
(35:54) good human beings first and foremost no yes no that is one of the things that they can do that's the most What's the
(36:00) most important thing then under feminism though the most important thing people having the choice to do what benefits
(36:06) they don't have the choice what do you mean they don't have the choice what person has full choice in doing what they want none of us have choices then
(36:13) we don't we are all a slave to the person who's stronger than us that's right so then where does this get off
(36:19) the ground all you're claiming is might right no I didn't say right i'm saying descriptively it's the case i'm asking
(36:24) you from your perspective if it's not if we agree that the leverage men have is brute strength such that they could
(36:32) basically hit a button called I'm not going to work tomorrow and the city collapses and I asked you point blank
(36:37) could women do the same job immediately and and get the city moving again you
(36:42) said no but then you said women could but women could leverage their bodies
(36:48) right women could kill their children i don't know but what do you you're talking about people have been put into
(36:53) spheres women have been designated to the domestic sphere and men have been designated to historic is that a construct what is that a construct i
(37:00) think largely it can be no is it i think in a certain sense it is but there is I
(37:06) I'm not denying that men are stronger than women generally and thus they have
(37:11) developed on different paths you're just claiming that because women are I mean in a certain sense women h having to be
(37:18) pregnant is a burden upon someone's body that that affects their ability to contribute to society in the same way if
(37:24) men if women weren't sidelined by pregnancy then so there's a biological aspect I agree with okay we both agree
(37:30) there the biological aspect of men collectively not every individual man but collectively generally speaking men
(37:37) are geared towards certain behavior certain work certain kinds of things high-risk things women are geared more
(37:43) towards something else and so if that's true this is what I'm asking you Oliver under your feminist view that you're
(37:49) advocating for saying feminism is good for society if it's not the best thing
(37:54) for women under your vision of feminism if it's not the best thing for women to
(37:59) be at home raising good human beings using their top leverage we both agree
(38:05) one of their top leverage uh points is I don't think I don't think every man should become a boxer and beat the [ __ ] out of people i didn't say that you
(38:11) don't need boxers for society you need people with brute with brute hold on you don't need boxers for society you need
(38:17) humans okay you You do need humans but you do need You're saying that every man therefore would be better off utilizing
(38:24) their brute strength at all times this isn't my positive position i'm asking you under your feminist view which
(38:29) you're affirming tonight so you're under cross-examination so what I'm just asking you a simple question mh if it's
(38:36) not motherhood and raising the next generation of good humans what is the
(38:42) higher obligation for women from a feminist view from your view no one has an obligation to necessarily raise the a
(38:49) generation the reason is because no wait a second i want to explain this because I think this is important and it's brought up a lot feminism has no obligations is something I've heard you
(38:55) say before i don't think that's true one of the obligations and one of the things that's not an obligation under feminism
() 
(39:01) is to raise children because no one has an obligation to do that however you
(39:06) will always have people who have children in a society because people want to have kids that's just something
(39:12) that happens so what we should do is we should incentivize people to have children by giving them the most
(39:18) economic resources available the most personal freedom available so that the people can make those decisions we
(39:24) should not go straight to let's force women to be in the home nobody said nobody said force okay well you were using the force doctrine no no for just
(39:30) because I appeal descriptively to force doctrine is something that you cannot avoid in any paradigm it doesn't follow
(39:36) that I'm advocating to force women to have children i'm asking from your perspective if feminism is good for
(39:42) society and society requires both force and people i'm asking what's the
(39:49) obligatory position from your view that men and women have and are they different they don't have distinct
(39:55) differences okay so if there's no obligations under feminism not true there's not gender specific obligations
(40:01) so when a so when a um so there's no Okay so there's no obligation for men
(40:08) under your feminist society to no to to enforce rights there's not an No wait
(40:14) there there is not an obligation is that gendered no no no there is not an obligation for individuals to enforce
(40:21) anything you don't have to become a police officer so what how could you argue what's good for society x is good
(40:28) fori society society has preconditions do you agree when we refer to society we're talking about an aggregate of
(40:35) people living in an ordered community right i don't think society necessarily has to be ordered but I would say that
(40:41) are the definition you're providing but I don't think the society has to be ordered there can be a society in chaos
(40:47) well to say it's in chaos means it's bordered you could actually look at it and say that societyy's in chaos and
(40:53) this one's not sure i guess no you're defining order then is just distinct
(40:58) that's fine sure societies are distinct and separate from each other that's fine so but if if you're saying would you
(41:05) aren't you arguing tonight that feminism would assume uh if you thought it was
(41:10) good that it would be ordered sure so feminist Okay if feminism is
(41:16) good for society and society the way you're referring to it is ordered it
(41:21) requires force which is gendered and it requires duties that are tied to that
(41:27) force which are gendered why yeah because you're arguing for women's rights no I disagree with the first part that that that this idea of enforcement
(41:34) is inherently gendered give me a counter example men don't have to enforce the
(41:40) law that's right is that the society you want to live in men will enforce law and women will enforce the law people step
(41:46) up no because you you're arguing that if we don't tell people you have to enforce the law you you have to become a police
(41:52) officer then no one will step up and do that i think we can incentivize people and give them the most freedom possible
(41:57) and individuals will gravitate towards the or towards the towards the industries okay let me ask a different
(42:04) way is society is a society better let's say society A has built into its
(42:11) metaethical position that it has that that men have the obligation to keep order with force and then another
(42:19) society that doesn't have that obl obligation which society is you think is better well you're assuming in the first
(42:24) one that that metaethical obligation would therefore entail that those people would follow that right well yeah well
(42:29) the obligation would include um potential uh legality but more so maybe
(42:35) social pressure of obligation um if that's exists let's say let's say it's it was a society that appealed to
(42:42) women's rights and there was an obligation for men to defend women and protect their rights versus your
(42:48) feminist uh you know hypothetical society that doesn't have any
(42:53) obligations ultimately what's one obligation i think people should defend those who are more vulnerable than they
(42:59) are general no no no women aren't just those who are more vulnerable because of course we can see that there are women
(43:05) who are stronger than men we can see that there are young men who are stronger than older men we can see Yeah
(43:11) of course we should talk about particulars you are talking about you're making you're kind of making men and women out to be this homogeneous group
(43:16) that they're all kind of exist in separate domains and that's just not how it works no it does h it is how it works
(43:22) and I'm demonstrating that generality is a perfectly fine thing to do i mean you can take a bunch of particulars add them
(43:30) up and come up with a generalization that's just basic induction so inductively isn't it the case that it's
(43:37) best it seems to be the best uh uh way to do it that men it just so happens to
(43:43) be the case that men are in the positions to enforce and defend and go to war you know why is it that men and
(43:49) women have different prison systems why do men and women have different prison systems i'm fully in favor of the I know
() 
(43:55) but couldn't you say couldn't you say your honor um you're just there are women who are some women who are
(44:00) stronger than men and there are some men you know and vice versa and stuff and appeal to these particulars but isn't it
(44:07) the case that a prison system is a perfect example of the generality that I'm actually arguing from sure but now
(44:13) you're making ugh claims on what basis are you making ought claims that I didn't make an claim well you're saying men and women ought to be indifferent i
(44:18) said descriptively the case there's a reason why they are but that reason is based in an ought claim of course it is
(44:24) do we have a duty to keep women away from outside of men's prisons do we have a duty
(44:30) i mean I think a society I from your point of view I don't I don't think that I don't think I think what you're doing is you're specifying duties really
(44:36) specifically the duty is not to keep women out of men's prisons the duty is to um keep um vulner people who are more
(44:44) vulnerable women not always necessarily i don't I don't like I don't I don't think we should who commits more
(44:50) aggressive acts against of course it's men i'm not arguing that it's not men but I think that in principle we should
(44:56) keep um a very you know a man that is weaker away from a woman who is a serial
(45:01) killer well that's a particular I'm talking about prisons though so why is it in your ideal feminist society why is
(45:09) it that if you're fighting for equality why is it you still have separate prisons what do you mean i'm not Well
(45:15) here's the thing that I put in my feminism thing we're not denying that there are disparities or differences we don't deny that there's disparities or
(45:21) differences between groups of men that doesn't mean that we think that I still ask you why though i I the question was
(45:28) why in your society are you obligated from your perspective you're arguing tonight to keep prisons separate wait
(45:35) who is obligated society as a whole is your is your ideal society look it's Oliver's world right now oliver is
(45:42) saying feminism is good for society that means there's a type of society that appeals to feminism and practices it i'm
(45:48) asking you from an outsider pretend I'm like uh like I'm visiting and I'm like
(45:54) why do you guys separate your prisons what's your answer uh we should I think we should largely separate prisons
(46:00) because yeah there are differences between men and women and I don't think and I think that men you know if men are especially men who are violent
(46:05) especially men who are in prison who have shown a lack of care for the safety of those around them I think we should
(46:11) also ensure that men aren't hurting other men in prison either like I don't I I don't know like I So now I'm going
(46:18) to ask you if you argue that women are generally collectively more vulnerable than men and that's why there's good
(46:23) reason i'm not arguing that there aren't some weak men that uh could be protected from stronger men but we're talking
(46:30) about male female here why though why are we talking why don't we go weak because because you are you are creating
(46:36) two categories and I'm saying that they exist of course the categories exist but you are making the claim that because Y
(46:43) is weaker than X right general rule as general rule why is we therefore we have an oblig No an obligation we should you
(46:50) know have separate I don't know prisons or something like that why can't we do that inner in intragender if that makes
(46:56) sense well the if you agree and if you agree that there's a good reason to have
(47:02) women and men's prisons separated then I'm going to ask you where where's the
(47:08) threshold where you no longer follow that rule outside of the prison what do you I'm asking where else in society are
(47:17) you willing to separate the women for the same reason willing to separate women for the same reason yeah i don't I
(47:23) don't I don't know like for instance let me give you a particular example is it better in your ideal feminist society
(47:29) that a weak woman is at home with her children and her husband at 11:30 p.m or
(47:35) signing out of her penthouse office with her lanyard coming down the elevator at
(47:40) 11:30 p.m potentially uh the the victim of a of a male crime i think you are
(47:46) reducing what is best for women like a homogeneous level or group that's going to be best
(47:53) no I don't I better Well you you're saying what's better because you're assuming that this woman is going to like be assaulted or something like that
(48:00) and I don't And yeah I would rather not have a woman get assaulted of course the solution though no no but the solution
(48:05) to that problem is not to say "Okay we need to keep all women in the home because men can't stop graping them." Like that's not really how we should
(48:12) operate well no well actually the fact that it's mostly men graing women goes
(48:18) to my point that the specific the the specific argument tonight it it comes
(48:24) back to the force doctrine every single time it's never the case where you're going to be collectively writing rules
(48:31) and and um basically making society around this view that that women that we
(48:37) should protect men from women ever right we should protect men from everyone but no no I'm saying generally speaking we
(48:44) don't structure society in a way that gears toward the concern of uh women
(48:49) aggressing men it's usually the other way around right i mean I think we should do both like I don't know i feel like a consequence of the patriarchy in
(48:56) these norms that we have is that men can't be victims of abuse men can't be physically abused by women and I think
(49:02) that's a problem we should not have that if a if a man is persistent to p is is subject to persistent physical abuse
(49:08) that should be taken seriously by a woman do you think that with enough manpower we can take down the patriarchy
() 
(49:15) with enough manpower i think with enough societal organization with enough like I don't
(49:21) know yeah work we can do it of course we can restructure society of course we can restructure society so with enough
(49:27) manpower we can restructure away from the patriarchy with enough change we can we can get away from the patriarchy i
(49:33) don't know like you're arguing that like because men have to do it therefore it's invalid or something like Well that's
(49:39) kind of what I'm asking is like if I ask someone with enough manpower and
(49:44) resources could you take down the thing that's literally going to be mirroring
(49:49) what you're aggregating in resources in other words to take down the
(49:55) patriarchy you need to find a bunch of strong people to fight against this bunch of strong people
(50:02) people are going to look like the collection of people
(50:13) this this this tyrannical body of men who are impeding on our rights you never
(50:18) go out and knock on the doors and grab the women first i mean in order to fight
(50:23) or Yeah sure what what but you also wouldn't grab weak men like Well no you would you would why not no why because
(50:30) they're still stronger than the women not all women no no no you're saying I I think there are I think the the echelon
(50:36) of like weakest men out there would absolutely be less strong than than the average woman i'm not sure if you take
(50:43) the same body frame if you knock on a door okay and it's like the same height right and even weight if you're going to
(50:50) go go to war you're going to grab the the dude it's not just because of force though would you agree that men are are
(50:58) more likely to exert aggression even for bad reasons than women
(51:04) sure yeah okay so if you're going to war you would want someone who was who is
(51:10) able capable and willing to exert their aggression on another aggressor whereas
(51:15) if if it's generally the case women are a little more timid why are they though why are they more like likely to
(51:22) exercise their aggression i think this is biology i don't know i don't I don't necessarily think that's the case do you have a son do I have a son no I don't i
(51:29) do okay so are you saying that um Well you're raising your son though well no
(51:34) i'm saying that um your son's going to reflect your world view well no no no a
(51:39) three-year-old and even beforehand you're going to notice when you become a father God willing which is
(51:44) anti-feminist um you're going to see that there's a clear distinction between
(51:49) boys and girls in their very uh instinct and and the way they even behave and
(51:54) express themselves and the aggressive ones the males are aggressive you just see it right in front of you that is not
(52:01) necessarily the case for all boys whatsoever not all generally speaking wait but you're also raising your son
(52:07) specifically everything you do is in a gendered sense you're raising your son to be what your version of You don't
(52:12) think we should affirm gendered uh gendered uh society i don't necessarily
(52:18) think we should tell people that there's a correct way to be a man or a correct way to be a woman so no I don't think
(52:23) that we should raise our sons to be aggressive to show their you know like like I don't know like that that
(52:29) aggression is a good way to get what you want or something like that well I'm not saying that but ultimately aggression
(52:34) and violence is an excellent way to get what you want um it works better it's it's more critically uh it's a critical
(52:42) rather would you rather your son uh primarily when he has a disagreement with someone like at school or something
(52:47) like that get into a fist fight with the kid or would you rather have him have the communication skills to be able to
(52:53) talk that disagreement out well in that instance the in that instance the ideal is to keep them uh in in a system right
(53:01) than to fight we're not talking about whether or not violence is useful every time now or not change it more often
(53:09) useful or we're talking about maintain the reason this came up is we're talking about maintaining society for instance
(53:15) the like let's take another thing would I rather would I rather the security guard at my school use force to stop an
(53:23) aggressor or talk to them nicely like the teacher does so wait it would depend on the situation because I do no no but
(53:30) I do absolutely think that in a lot of these situations deescalation can be effective and be more effective than
(53:36) just violence is great deescalation no it's not yes it is you're you're wait a
(53:42) second you're one assuming that the violence will be successful in its in its aim and two that it won't have other
(53:47) ramifications i think a society that always deals with its problems violently
(53:52) will actually have worse consequences i don't think we should encourage kids to beat the [ __ ] out of each other every
(53:58) time but but that's what you're saying that's what violence is a very effective way to get what you want i didn't say the ought i described that it is you
(54:05) keep confusing ought and and description first off I actually don't think it is because it can become self-defeating if
(54:11) your way of always resolving conflict is resorting to violence people will be less likely to associate with you people
(54:17) will be less likely to you yeah really okay so but if you extrapolate that out because we're talking about societies
(54:24) right now is society better with feminism is is is feminism good for society right the reason this is such an
(54:31) important topic this this violence and force aspect is because society itself
(54:36) no matter how you try to um poetically describe your vision of of feminism it's
(54:43) always going to be reliant on the threat of force and so at this mass scale level
(54:50) Oliver you're going to be an advocate for a pointing gun right at the society
(54:56) and saying if you aggress over here force is going to come in that's what the violation of a right is right i
(55:03) don't think that's how I would want society to you don't want if you want society with rights which is in your
(55:08) opening feminism individuals having the same equal rights equal opportunities if you want that you have to enforce it of
(55:16) course you do if you want that and you have to enforce it you need you need to appeal to inequality it's a
(55:23) contradiction what do you mean you have to appeal to inequality everyone has to appeal to inequality all the time in order to specifically with sexes no no
(55:31) wait a second no because then every man has to appeal to someone who is stronger
(55:36) than him un Yeah but unless Okay then then all men are at the mercy of the man
(55:42) who is stronger that's right patriarchy that's descriptively placed now now that you admit that that's actually true and
(55:48) I conceded that that's true why does that matter i'm saying it matters because if you advocate for a feminist
(55:54) society you're advocating you're actually I would argue that rights themselves uh feminism is actually
(56:01) sexist ironically because feminism assuming rights assumes there's a body
(56:06) of men who are going to defend those rights they don't have the obligation to do that of course people have an
(56:12) obligation to defend those under feminism why why i just think in general everyone should have an obligation to
(56:18) defend those who cares what you think sure if you don't have any sort of empathy or care for anyone else other than yourself no but empathy isn't it
(56:25) dude empath I've seen a video you did empathy empathy is an involuntary signal
(56:30) that is perhaps what someone else is experiencing that doesn't tell you what you ought to do you're in a debate now
(56:37) arguing feminism is good for society i bring in what's necessary to keep the good in society and highlight force i
(56:44) ask you point blank under your feminist view do men have the obligation morally
(56:50) ethically to uphold law that provides the playground you call feminism
(56:56) feminist freedom men society in general has an obligation I guess to maintain
(57:02) itself but it doesn't follow from that that every man has an obligation to
(57:07) uphold society well then then this doesn't have any bearing it does bear it does have bearing because we're talking about a
(57:13) collective right we're already we're choosing the people who already exist right now let's choose the stronger men
(57:19) let's choose there's a bunch of strong men let's choose the men that can actually enforce there's a bunch of men right now who are really strong they're
(57:25) in uniforms yes yep yep they have to be trained they're in uniforms hops probably too unhealthy for my my taste
(57:32) but let's just say they're all fit okay they're in a position where they come in
(57:37) and there's a there's a a man or a woman being aggravated assaulted by someone
(57:42) okay under your system of feminism because it has to be from a feminist view why does why does the collective of
(57:49) mostly men who are the enforcement arm why do they have an obligation to defend anybody
(57:55) because you shouldn't want to see people hurt like I don't know how to I don't know i don't know how to appeal that's like saying like you should like
(58:01) licorice ice cream no I don't because I don't I think I think seeing someone suffering and wanting that not to exist
(58:07) is different than ice cream flavor what do you like i I think you're appealing to an
(58:13) ultimate ultimately morally relativistic No no you are you're appealing to moral this idea of moral
(58:18) relativism that No it's not my view i am not a moral relativist no I don't have to be absolutely not okay how do you
(58:25) Would you would you like me to tell you how I I have Why is feminism morally good why is it morally good so we can
() 
(58:32) appeal to for example I think that moral objectivism can be defended on the basis
(58:38) the same way that like um what is it called epistemic objectivism can be defended basically this idea that I know
(58:44) that the world around me exists how do I know that the world around me exists do I really know that the world around me
(58:49) exists no I wouldn't grant that but go on okay okay well so we don't we don't really we're trusting our senses to tell
(58:56) us that the world around us exists i'm intuitively trusting that you're sitting in front of me with a microphone i have
(59:01) a microphone i have my iPad glass of water here all of that i could be wrong
(59:06) i could indeed be wrong i could be a brain in a vat but I'm trusting my intuitive sense that my senses are
(59:11) telling me correct information i'm going to I'm going to grant you an escape from soypism i'm going to grant you your
(59:17) sense data how do you get a moral statement from sense data because moral statements largely are
(59:24) sense-based i can't I can't give you a You can't really give me moral objectivism either wait wait wait my
(59:30) view is not on the chopping block you're the affirmative you're the affirmative we can get into it but the affirmative
(59:37) is feminism is good for society that's what you came today right it leads to people let's say my view Christianity
(59:44) let's just what if it was just terrible for society it still wouldn't change the the position you're in you would have to
(59:50) argue why a feminism is good for society so if you're going to sense data and you're saying "Well I use sense data to
(59:58) navigate the world and I evaluate the sense data and murder." It also tells me unjustified killing is wrong no it
(1:00:05) doesn't yeah why not look why doesn't it does your eye tell you that this is black um yeah it does okay so black has
(1:00:13) a frequency a reflective uh aspect of light sure I could be wrong yeah right
(1:00:18) right but the frequency exists right the same frequency of having an intuition on a moral level no no no hold on hold on a
(1:00:25) second the reason I asked about the microphone is that black red the spectrum of colors the frequency of
(1:00:31) light that all comes from white it reflects differently and so that maintains even if you and I see things
(1:00:37) slightly different the thing that maintain what if I say it's not black that maintains well I would say it's I would say it's a light a dark gray okay
(1:00:43) then what if I say that it's white you could understand well if you said it was white if you said it was white then we
(1:00:49) would appeal to some other people's uh views so we can appeal to other people's views so if one person No no if one
(1:00:55) person says that murder is okay and everyone else disagrees and says that it's wrong we can appeal to them and say you're wrong so in the same way that I
(1:01:02) would say that that's what are you arguing so wait how is that not subjectivism from your position what do
(1:01:07) you I think that it is as objective as we can get oh so you're saying it's not objective i because I don't think we can
(1:01:14) have a 100% certainty this is what I'm asking you we didn't have 100% certainty on anything where in the instance of a
(1:01:20) person deleting another person did you where in the sense data itself the
(1:01:25) person is a size they have hair they have a shirt on or not these these are all features of reality that you're
(1:01:32) pointing to the external world where in that are you perceiving morality where am I perceiving morality the sense that
(1:01:39) I get the intuitive sense that I get out of it but it's not the sense data though it can be absolutely i would see it wait a second no hold on i would see it is
(1:01:45) this moral wait what is this moral um having water this cup can you determine
(1:01:51) this cup is it moral or not uh if you were to throw it at me I could no it wouldn't be the cup that was immoral
(1:01:57) sure it wouldn't but what what would matter about that so what I'm pointing to is you said because now we're in
(1:02:02) metaeththics because if you're saying feminism is good for society if you're saying it's good for society you're
(1:02:09) making a metaethical statement about the good i'm asking from your view where what what grounds the good and you said
(1:02:16) sense data but the thing is you can't point to anything in the world that occurs as an event and look at the event
(1:02:23) itself and get and retrieve empirically the good why not well you're claiming it
(1:02:29) how where is it i see something happen and I and I have an intuitive sense about it okay someone sees something
(1:02:35) else and they have an intuitive sense that it was justified and you disagree okay absolutely and No wait a second but that's the same problem empirically if I
(1:02:41) say that's white if I say that's white and you say how how are they how are they different that's not the same but how are they different because this is
(1:02:48) this is actual sense data no no no this is actual sense data the opinion about
(1:02:53) what this is is not whether or not it's good or not this is ought this is is
(1:02:58) this is a guil this is Hume's guil guillotine this is like this is like describing things into the good right
(1:03:05) this is a philosophical problem that you can't bridge no isought I get the isought for why would if you know that
(1:03:12) of that because wait at some point you have to assert a moral claim that you
(1:03:17) can't further back up they have to bottom out somewhere so they have to bottom then Oliver why would you even
(1:03:22) use sensa why don't you just say regardless of seeing anything I have a feeling what if someone described
(1:03:28) something you didn't see anything and you got a feel wait a second but that's still sense data you hear it from them you hear their story you hear that it
(1:03:34) evokes a response in you so yeah and then that's a response okay so the same way I see that okay then how do you
(1:03:41) argue with let's say a nation predominantly held like a Christian view
(1:03:46) that women that feminism was immoral and they out they outnumbered you would you
(1:03:52) just submit no you can't well you can't you just make fine then yeah whoever has the most power automatically You mean
(1:03:57) force but that's a descriptive claim of course whoever has the most power is in
(1:04:02) holding all else equal mind you we have to hold everything else equal in that scenario because just having brute force doesn't necessarily mean you are going
(1:04:09) to win well not necessarily if someone's better organized if they have better access to resources they would still
(1:04:15) need some aspect of force to but it's not ultimate it's not like you know it's
(1:04:21) we don't add up the who has the most strength and least strength and then determine that's what if you agree if you agree that if you have a feminist
(1:04:28) view and I have an anti-feminist view the ultimate descriptor I'm not saying might is right i'm saying might is it
(1:04:35) just is and I don't disagree with you so if might just is and we both agree that
(1:04:40) might is is in fact a gendered statement I'm arguing that feminism itself relies
(1:04:47) on a view it relies on a a part of reality that's antithetical to the ideal
(1:04:54) of feminism that that feminism itself in practice rights privileges all of these
(1:05:01) things you're adding to women right in their in their in their life that they are granted are granted by stronger
(1:05:08) people that are merely allowing them to have them fine then that's the same thing you that's a patriarchy no wait a
(1:05:14) second no wait that's you can make the same argument within a gender you are separating it into men and women why
(1:05:21) can't I divide men up and say that yeah stronger men okay well then I don't see
(1:05:26) that's in favor of a patriarchy though if men look if men win against other men it's still a patriarchy i But we
(1:05:33) shouldn't base it on the enforcement oliver let me just I just want you to concede if men take over other men it's
(1:05:38) still a patriarchy that's not what defines patriarchy because it's not the enforcement it's not what men could do that defines whether it's a patriarchy
(1:05:45) the same way we are not a militaristic state authoritarian state just because
(1:05:50) the military could if they want overthrow democracy well no they're allowing it not to be sure so then are
(1:05:57) we allowance wait a second no fine then are we would it be correct to describe our country right now as a militaristic
() 
(1:06:04) authoritarian regime potentially i would say that rights themselves are fairly
(1:06:10) authoritarian just to assuming them like like for instance people say often maybe
(1:06:15) you've argue with the Oliver where you're like I'm totally fine with what you believe just don't force your
(1:06:20) beliefs on me right have you said that to someone no I haven't you heard someone say that right i have i think it's stupid right do you agree that you
(1:06:27) would It's actually probably good thing to force your beliefs on people no if I I think Oh it would depend on what you
(1:06:32) mean by force but I think I I I think saying if if someone believes something I don't know why they wouldn't want to if they believe it to be correct i don't
(1:06:38) know why they wouldn't want to share that belief and have others adopt what they view as the true well not even share let's say let's say I agree with
(1:06:44) you if if you understand if someone held a belief and they truly believed it not
(1:06:50) only would they want to share that belief uh and have other potentially believe it but meet others who already
(1:06:55) believe it the next step would simply be why wouldn't they I don't know take
(1:07:00) positions of of government and legislative uh office seats and say well
(1:07:06) I love my view so much and I've I've I've gained so many people around me who love my view why wouldn't I just use the
(1:07:13) enforcement arm isn't the ultimate goal here like even in this debate even in this debate like pizza or if I love
(1:07:19) pizza I want to bring the government into superficial no it's not because it's the same similar type of view you
(1:07:25) could extrapolate it that far if you want and and that would be ridicul would would you say it's ridiculous for someone who's like I like pizza this
(1:07:30) much i like cheese pizza i would like everyone to like cheese pizza if people don't like cheese pizza because I think
(1:07:36) it's correct and I think it's the best type of pizza i'm going to enforce everyone to eat cheese pizza no regardless if I want that I'm saying
(1:07:42) that that's actually possible yeah but we would look upon that person is why that's fine if you would be weird it
(1:07:49) would be weird yeah but call I I understand we both agree that would be weird i'm not debating whether or not we
(1:07:55) agree on things that are weird what we're debating tonight is like the foundation of feminism rests on
(1:08:01) something that's counterescriptive to feminism no yes if feminism look I'll do it again
(1:08:08) feminism is the movement away from men in power is that better than patriarchy
() 
(1:08:14) it's the movement away from men in power men men inherently having power dominant
(1:08:20) yeah the dominant collective because there are men women being excluded from that women's rights is a feminist movement
(1:08:28) it's Yeah sure okay so if women's rights is a feminist movement away from the
(1:08:34) movement of men in power why does women's rights were require the thing that they're opposing
(1:08:42) wait because you can just because someone has power doesn't mean they're exercising it against you like I don't I
(1:08:47) don't see like you're you're saying like there's always going to be a man in charge therefore there's going to be a collection of in a society that's
(1:08:54) ordered that has any kind of law or or say rights which are which are privileges or entitlements without any
(1:09:01) duties in this case feminism is a movement away from men in power women's
(1:09:07) rights is a feminist movement supposedly against this power structure and yet
(1:09:14) their opinion against men though i know but it's a No it's not against No no you got to follow this line though i'm not
(1:09:19) saying they hate men or whatever i'm saying that the actual movement to affirm and defend and protect rights
(1:09:26) they're asking daddy they're asking daddy for an allowance no they're asking society in general no society's opinion
(1:09:34) doesn't matter when the force comes in sure the force does come in but what the only thing we're talking about agree but
(1:09:39) here's the thing that I'm I'm running into the problem is you are assuming that men will act this way that men will
(1:09:46) do this that men will act as a collective to enforce their will necessarily i think I'm saying that I
(1:09:54) think if I think I think socialization look I don't think we automatically tell our I don't think we should and I hope
(1:09:59) you're not raising your son to say if someone has a toy and you really want that toy go over there and take it from them to mends what the toy is that could
(1:10:05) be good for them actually you know what I mean like it could be good for you and me as like look look let's just
(1:10:11) hypothetic generalizing making generalizations all the time Oliver is it possible that there's an instance
(1:10:16) that of necessary growth of boys battling it out sure of course but we're talking in generalities because you're
(1:10:23) you you're saying that I can't appeal to the fact that there are men that are weaker than women to invalidate the claim that like this forced doctrine
(1:10:30) wasn't the question wasn't your question well just because a collective of men could take over doesn't ma doesn't mean
(1:10:37) that men will take over they won't you ever debated anarchists i have not i mean I've I've heard their Okay i just
(1:10:43) want to I want to put this on you pretend pretend you and I are debating against a third person who's an anarchist for a second we're we're on
(1:10:49) the same team for a second and I say I ask them "Why do you think anarchy is possible?" And they say "Well because
(1:10:56) most people are passive and don't want to you know use their force and their will to control people." Yeah and then
(1:11:02) they ask me "Why do you think anarchy doesn't work?" I I answer the same exact
(1:11:08) thing because most people don't use force but the the small group that does
(1:11:14) that does want to use their force they will why can't there be another group that uses their force contrary to that
(1:11:21) in support are they made up of men sure some of them can be and some of them patriarchy for the win no but it but
(1:11:28) that's not how we should define what a society is just by who makes up the majority society
(1:11:35) whatever whatever ordered thing you talk is that fine with you can come up with one that you like better I don't find it can be ordered but I agree that there
(1:11:42) has to be some sort of order to society I'm not disagreeing with you now would you agree that order suppososes force
(1:11:50) I guess the threat of force sure I but the threat has to be able to be actualized right ultimately Like if you
(1:11:57) call their bluff over and over sure yeah fine it has to be actualized this is what I'm saying and I don't know how
(1:12:02) many time more times I can drive this home is that your vision of feminism being rights equal opportunities you're
() 
(1:12:10) basically saying society is in a place where females should be more liberated
(1:12:16) to be in all sorts of different areas okay that's what you're really arguing you're arguing that society is
(1:12:22) essentially which I kind of agree is an amusement park that's already been built and maintained largely by men right
(1:12:30) you're just adding a police element and what you're saying is feminism is Disney World they should be able to ride on
(1:12:36) every ride and then I go "No everyone should have access to the rides." I know but who enforces that everyone has
(1:12:42) access to the rides men it's society in general and you are right that it is primarily going to be men so would you
(1:12:48) concede would you concede that your vision of feminism actualized requires
(1:12:53) something antithetical to feminism no it is not antithetical because just saying that men should do the right thing and
(1:13:00) men should be in favor of these things is not against feminism i don't see how that's against No I didn't say should i
(1:13:05) said well that's your other problem is do they have an obligation but the bigger problem is is it actually a
(1:13:10) necessity that men collectively defend women's rights i think it is it is it is
(1:13:16) a necessity that society defends the rights of those who are less vulnerable keep saying it can't be random people in
(1:13:23) society stronger you're right that those sure will you concede for the audience
(1:13:28) then that your vision of feminism requires by necessity the actualization
() 
(1:13:34) and the threat of stronger people who are predominantly
(1:13:39) men sure okay so feminism requires men in power feminism requires men to
(1:13:47) support feminist goals in power it's an allowance system everything is an allowance system like I
(1:13:54) don't we're bargaining with people who are stronger and have more power than we do in order to get what we want so that means feminism the way you're describing
(1:14:01) it relies wholly every aspect that any kind of cherries you want to put on top
(1:14:06) like any amenities extra extra whipped cream on the feminist boat ultimately
(1:14:11) you're asking and women today are still asking please stronger collection of men
(1:14:17) allow us to do xyz right I think it's it's ask yeah it's asking society not to
(1:14:23) hurt them what do you yeah but that that's an that's an inequality I'm not
(1:14:28) arguing that women are as strong as men I'm not trying to argue that as a collection that they're that they're
(1:14:34) equal in every aspect yeah but you said equal opportunities of course do women
(1:14:39) have the equal opport opportunity to defend or take other people's rights
(1:14:46) if you're talking like all everything all else equal or are we talking like they they can have certain abilities to
(1:14:52) do that in terms of the weaponry that they have in terms of of the organization of society that they have like I don't I think that you're
(1:14:58) assuming that we live in a state of nature which we don't currently live in a state of nature no I still think that
(1:15:04) nature bleeds in i I know what you're saying that we live in a state of luxury are you saying like decadence a little
(1:15:10) bit it's not like it's like brut It's not like brutality of the wilderness right sure because of
(1:15:16) men because that's men built structures built concrete jungles you know they
(1:15:23) they built underground a lot no but okay but a fair amount of that was the only
(1:15:28) reason we're not in the jungle is because of men you do realize that a collection of men together without like
(1:15:34) knowing like how a building is made you can't just pull like a bunch of men together and say build this building
(1:15:39) they're not going to know how to do that i understand you need engineers but that's irrelevant because if without if
(1:15:45) you say without the engineer you can't build a building well there are people who've built buildings without insane
(1:15:51) levels of engineering i'm not saying that but I'm saying to build the society that we have right now you to maintain it you need brute force you can't fix
(1:15:58) anything what does it have well well we're back to the leverage if men can
(1:16:03) leverage their brute force so I I gave the example of voting that when collective of men vote they're basically
(1:16:10) saying I you know what I'm going to vote even though the alternative I don't want to do the alternative but the
(1:16:16) alternative could be that I get my all my friends with our guns and overthrow if we can we'll start a war or whatever
(1:16:22) why can't women get together with all their friends who are men and do that wait what you're saying men can appeal
(1:16:28) to other men to enforce their own rights why can't women do the same thing men can collectively do that without women
(1:16:35) women can't do it without men i don't think that's necessarily true it is absolutely true there's no women There's
(1:16:40) no collective of women who could if that was true uh some of what you would think
(1:16:45) are the worst uh places in in the world in regards to a woman's experience the
(1:16:50) standard middle can't take over the men i think that they could as you're
(1:16:56) talking about leverage you know the power that they do have against that system i'm not denying that there's
(1:17:02) biological differences between men and women i don't see kind of what argument you're getting i think that women are
(1:17:08) largely in a sense many women are complicit in the patriarchal structure that we have and help to uplift it there
(1:17:14) is a war yeah but but but I'm saying that that it is not all just brute force there's an ideological component here
(1:17:21) there's women who believe in this system and will back men up on it i understand that i'm not I'm not saying that doesn't
(1:17:27) exist i'm saying if you had all of that stuff exists they just wouldn't do it no none of it matters uh if if you don't
(1:17:33) have force enforcing it if every woman in society collectively all of them which is an impossible hypothetical
(1:17:39) because all women are not going to agree on something and all men are not going to agree on something if all women you know decided immediately to disagree
(1:17:45) with all men y do you think all men would stand strong in that disagreement and be like "No you're my slave now." Or
(1:17:51) would some of them be like "Wow my wife is coming to me and saying she doesn't like disagree about though like the way
(1:17:57) the way societyy's structured." Yeah I would say you know what the men would say what that I would get all the men to
(1:18:02) collectively get together no no I No look if all the women collectively got together and screeched into the ether
(1:18:10) and went "We don't like it anymore." That's basically every women's march by the way um what men like to do from the
(1:18:17) sidelines in the houses that they built is say "What are you going to do about it?"
(1:18:23) Hold on but then that's just being like "Fuck you i don't give a [ __ ] about you." Well in a funny way no no it's not saying we don't give a [ __ ] because the
(1:18:29) people we're talking about are misguiding and they're misguided with what their their uh their leverage is so
(1:18:37) women's leverage is not marching in the street holding signs until things change even though uh let's say the 18th
(1:18:43) amendment before the 19th amendment before they could vote they did have a moral leverage so I actually agree with
(1:18:49) you that women do have some sort of uh I don't want to call it manipulation in in a pjorative sense but they have the
(1:18:56) ability back then by the way they had the ability to point out let's say moral
(1:19:02) uh issues right point out degeneracy point out things that were indecent
(1:19:07) women have a sense about we call we call them karens now right back in the day before they were given uh the right to
(1:19:14) vote the 18th amendment they actually used their moral leverage within society because men still uh
(1:19:21) revered women and their opinions about certain things because they had a specific place in their in their home
(1:19:27) and in society men still do that you're never going to get all men to ignore the interests of all women i understand i'm
(1:19:33) not saying I'm saying no i'm saying that without men actualizing whatever the
(1:19:39) request is it's just a grievance i'm not denying that if a society does not follow through on what the grievances
(1:19:46) are then sure you keep Oliver you keep swapping i understand why you're doing this it's fine but I'm going to correct
(1:19:53) you every time you can't swap out when you what we really mean is a collection
(1:19:58) of men specifically and you keep saying society to ambiguate it i'm going to keep disambiguating it because it drives
(1:20:05) the point home if there's a collection of people who think society should be XYZ and they want to actualize it that
(1:20:13) is force they're going to develop laws they're going to develop all sorts of systems you're going to require brute
(1:20:19) force what I'm saying is that's descriptively inequality why because in
() 
(1:20:25) your opening as you move away from feminism God willing um at least take
(1:20:31) out equal opportunities because that's not even true for men no I'm not but I'm not saying that everyone like because
(1:20:38) everyone should be given the opportunity to given by who dude why don't say
(1:20:43) society again but why society but it's not I don't see how that's relevant though it is relevant look I look at the
(1:20:50) world through a descriptive lens that it's a pat it's patriarchal and it's hierarchical i'm not saying it's an it's
(1:20:56) a ought that might is good always might sometimes is good but let's look at it as a house right let's say you're the
(1:21:03) father again God willing I'm throwing this out there oliver the father you have five kids beautiful wife big old
(1:21:10) house from being a lawyer okay the kids are the women in this instance i don't
(1:21:16) just just just it's just an analogy okay yeah okay the kids are screaming "I want the house this way i want They're
(1:21:23) screaming loud they made signs they march every morning in front of the breakfast nook." Okay okay right you're
(1:21:28) like "Sit down have have breakfast." um if they equal the the the protesters
(1:21:34) right in this instance isn't it ultimately who is it ultimately going to be up to in the house whether they
(1:21:41) change the house or not if they change the house if they change they're screaming to change the house right
(1:21:47) who's ultimately going to going to decide whether it's going to happen or not sure the the person who has the power i'm not disagreeing so you agree
(1:21:53) in the analogy it's a good analogy because the women in society don't have the equal opportunity or power to change
(1:22:00) society they need to get the ears of men they need to somehow use other forms of
(1:22:06) leverage but it's never going to be identical to power what I'm saying to you I think we agree men's leverage is
(1:22:13) brute force do they use it correctly or not that's a whole other debate right is it just or not women have the leverage
(1:22:20) of being the potential mothers and wives and and the the childbearsers and the people raising the children my view is
(1:22:28) that women's high the the best place a woman a collection of women I'm not saying all of them and I'm not saying
() 
(1:22:34) force i'm saying the best thing for to advocate for women the truest form of
(1:22:39) real feminism would be to appeal to the feminine nature and what they're really good at which is not fighting and making
(1:22:45) people bleed it's raising children why are you Why are Why is that not feminist why are you dichomizing those though
(1:22:51) because you're saying that society is is fundamentally dichomized into fighting and killing each other and raising
(1:22:57) children i don't think that those are the only two things can do but but then why can't women and men I think women
(1:23:04) and men should pursue other things that aren't just fighting and killing people and raising children because there is so
(1:23:11) much in between there that both men and women can't do i'm not saying they can't do these things i'm saying I'm trying to
(1:23:16) prioritize that's why I'm going to I'm going to try to You have to be a little charitable with the dichotomy because
(1:23:22) I'm looking at urgency and priority okay i'm not saying that there isn't a list of things underneath that they can't
(1:23:28) want or might want to do and not do or whatever i'm saying ultimately for a society to exist you need two thing
(1:23:34) three things law and order which we already establish requires men primarily
(1:23:40) for the most part obligations and duties still a little bit blurry on your side of how what provides obligations and
(1:23:46) duties but then people human beings do you know that we like I know that you mentioned we do we do have a fertility c
(1:23:53) we do have a a birth rate okay would you I'm not going to blame everything on feminists but would you concede that
(1:23:59) you've at least witnessed pretty high octane um uh propaganda from a feminist
(1:24:07) view against mothering and being a mother in the as a requirement yes not as a
(1:24:14) requirement yes as a requirement as an obligation that women have and if they don't do it they are failing as women
(1:24:20) yes i have never I have seen very I have seen very little of feminists saying you
(1:24:25) can't have kids a majority of feminists and people do have children i'm not saying can't i'm saying what's being
(1:24:31) presented as strong fem do you see mostly mothers or do you see girl bosses
(1:24:37) just answer that fine i And I think the reason we see it as girl bosses is because for so long being a woman has
(1:24:45) been defined as being a mother so what this is is it's a reaction to the to the
(1:24:51) prescriptions that have been put on women for so long what does it mean to be a good woman you raise a child you
(1:24:56) raise children you're in the home it's still correct it's still correct though i don't No not necessarily you don't
(1:25:02) Women don't have to do that men don't have to if you want a society you have to do that you do there has to do you want a feminist society or not i do want
(1:25:08) a feminist society then you need those things no no you do but you don't need to obligate people to do that people
(1:25:13) will do it on their own you don't have to tell them they're not doing it why aren't they doing it it's because they
(1:25:18) can't [ __ ] afford to do it no that's not true it is why do the poorest people have the most Why do the poorest people
(1:25:24) have the most kids why do poor poorest people have the most kids generally largely because they don't have access to contraception they don't have a
(1:25:29) second because they don't have access to Hold on a second we don't have a moderator you just said cuz people can't
(1:25:35) afford it i just pointed a counter i just gave you a counterpoint that the poorest people are having the most kids
(1:25:41) mhm yes so that's not a good reason hold on just because poor people are having children more poor people have more
(1:25:48) children than the wealthy released from the fully liberated uh fem fot right the
(1:25:55) feoids are in Western luxurious countries i would argue that it's not
(1:26:00) because they don't have money it's because they're they have a materialist worldview well no i think they have a
(1:26:06) worldview that says you have the option to have children or not i think no people people who are poor I think
(1:26:12) largely I think I think you're in college dude yeah I am in college wait a second are you saying that you don't hear every from every angle not just in
(1:26:20) media not just in in movies not just in education you're not hearing the messaging that says women we got to
(1:26:28) fight against this whole like you being at home being a mother thing you need to be a strong independent woman right go
(1:26:34) out there and be a a girl boss right and what I and I don't I don't know what women you're talking to i don't think
(1:26:39) and I look I we can ask women this question when you hear that do you hear I should not have children or I should
(1:26:46) not center every aspect of my existence around being a mother and instead prioritize some of my own well-being
(1:26:53) over that and I don't think that is antithetical to having a society that has children people will have children
(1:26:59) if they if they have the Forget the odd for a second okay I'm going to grant you that the ought claim isn't being made
(1:27:05) but are you saying the power the power of media in today's age you and me are
(1:27:11) not going to agree that that doesn't influence the way women see childhood
(1:27:16) like I see birth look every sing look dude every single image of childbirth in
(1:27:22) media for the last 20 years has been like an emergency screaming fest where everyone's like it looks like they're
(1:27:27) about to die dude and what happens after that what do you mean what happens no in the scene what happens after the
(1:27:32) screaming and that all that well they they give them the baby and if it's not poorly written well they get a shot of uh endorphins there you go so it's not
(1:27:39) anti- having children it shows that and then have they love their children and it's a beautiful baby fair enough but
(1:27:46) when you're looking at the overall propaganda from feminism right i don't think you're the representation by the
(1:27:52) way i I don't I don't really think there is a representation you don't think there's a you don't think there's a
(1:27:57) central throughine of nar um of u of narrative through from the general
(1:28:03) feminist like even all every every phase of feminism there's a through line there's I think I think there is a type
(1:28:09) of feminism I think there is a picture of feminism that gets amplified by the media and people who no and people who
(1:28:16) are sympathetic to your view because of the way that algorithms are structured and the way that media structure you get presented yeah of course yeah women hate
(1:28:23) having children they view being mothers is inherently oppressive and they yell that i'm not saying that's not a
(1:28:28) narrative i'm just saying I don't think it's actually something that most people and even women subscribe to i think most
(1:28:35) women ideally want to be mothers they just don't want to be defined as
(1:28:40) childbearers they don't want to be because they want to be able to have other because just like men aren't
(1:28:46) defined as as as fathering children i know but like
(1:28:52) okay like like I don't what what else what else would you define a woman
(1:28:58) as in her lifetime right i'm not saying all women have kids it's like they could
() 
(1:29:03) live into different futures especially women who can't have kids but ultimately we're looking at what what should be
(1:29:10) advocated right right i'm here i'll put it simply from your view of feminism why
(1:29:16) isn't feminism pri uh prioritize motherhood because because
(1:29:22) your side of it prioritizes motherhood in such a way no no wait because it prioritizes motherhood in such a way
(1:29:28) that is oppressive no dude it's total opposite let me let me tell you why it's opposite you want women to be in the
(1:29:33) home you don't want women in the home let me tell you why it's opposite what do you What let me tell you why it's opposite are you really telling me right now you don't use Let me tell you why
(1:29:39) it's opposite the vote is it more is it more oppressive on a woman to be in the home or to be in debt um I think that it
(1:29:48) depends first one on who the woman is and what she wants i think it's more oppressive to force a woman to be in the
(1:29:56) Yes you do who how do you force a woman to be at home uh don't allow her to go to work use the exact force document
(1:30:02) apparently what are you talking about of course it's No that's that's some type of uh that's some sort of emotional
(1:30:07) coercion the threat of violence aren't we Aren't we all Aren't we totally You say everything bottoms out in violence
(1:30:13) you say everything bottoms out in No no no you use not everything no when it comes to When it comes to right No when
(1:30:18) it comes to rights which you're advocating for when it comes to when it comes to um engagement let's say man and
(1:30:24) woman okay uh both the man and the woman have different forms of uh let's say
(1:30:29) manipulation co type of coercion some type of like if you ultimatums this kind of thing okay women and men can both do
(1:30:37) that but the reason when you said women are more oppressed when they were in the home okay look when they started the
(1:30:44) suffrage movement right do you think that it was most women who wanted the vote no I know a lot of them were against it because they were against it
(1:30:50) because they thought it would um require them to also be conscripted into the military and they did not want that as a
(1:30:56) thing and that they would also be uh uh subject to debt as well but mostly the
(1:31:02) first thing you said um did you know that the the the m minority that was the suffragette movement actually shut shut
(1:31:10) down and made it hard right thwarted these women showing up in a type of primary votes to vote against their own
(1:31:17) vote hold on i mean I feel like that's not that surprising though i know but how look dude hold on wait no no wait if
(1:31:22) if a bunch of Hold this is going to be a poor analogy but it's coming to mind right now imagine that I guess black
(1:31:28) people wanted to be free from slavery and they knew that there was a faction of black people who would outnumber them
(1:31:34) and I guess had been convinced that slavery was good and they tried to stop those people from coming in and keeping
(1:31:40) them in chains would it would it be ridiculous for them to do that i don't think so i think it would make sense we
(1:31:45) don't want these women voting against us having the analogy actually comes back
(1:31:51) to the force doctrine because these people used force and other techniques to stop the women from actually showing
(1:31:56) up you know what they said who who did that who thece who used force well they would actually physically isn't is it
(1:32:03) obstruction force well sure but who was do using the force then oh it was probably a collection of men men okay so
(1:32:08) then men were the ones who unfortunately were against women having the right to vote because it doesn't matter what
(1:32:13) women want because they can't enforce no no you're you're confusing me you're confusing me i'm saying the people
(1:32:19) pro-women voting shut down the majority of women who were going to come to vote
(1:32:24) right against their own vote why do you understand i I get it then why were men
(1:32:30) advocating why were men using force to stop women from advocating against them voting there were men on either side who
(1:32:37) didn't who were like "What the hell's going on?" But what what I'm saying is that when it comes to the reasoning though Oliver the the whole group of the
(1:32:45) suffragettes they basically were like they gas lit the women right this is
(1:32:50) what's so ironic is that they said they said "Oh these women who are the
(1:32:56) majority they're just so docel from being in the home that they're not thinking right in their opposition to
(1:33:03) voting so we have to figure out a way to stop them from opposing it they were
(1:33:08) literally looking at the women like the women didn't have the right mind to say no uh being in the home is is best for
(1:33:16) society best for motherhood best for children uh it's best to not get conscripted it's best to not hold debt
(1:33:22) and it's best for men to manage all these other things there's this gendered system that they were they that they
(1:33:27) were living in these radicals basically were saying "No we got to change the world." Right it's always this
(1:33:33) revolutionary movement right but the thing is the revolutionary movement ironically still requires the thing that
(1:33:40) they're opposing they're asking daddy for the force fine I can be against
(1:33:45) violence and realize that in order to actually be against violence there must
(1:33:50) be some threat of violence to back that up but that doesn't make it contradictory to be against unjustified
(1:33:58) violence well no I'm talking about violence i'm talking about feminism no no no you're saying that feminism is a contradiction because they are against
(1:34:05) men and their power and in order to be against that you have to appeal to men
() 
(1:34:12) so in order to be against violence you have to have some sort of violence
(1:34:19) opposing that well no it is it is a No no i'm saying it's actually worse it's
(1:34:25) it's like it's like to specifically the feminist I understand the violence
(1:34:31) paradox this is this is more than that it's it's that that women them because you could have a violence paradox with
(1:34:36) two groups of men right sure but I'm saying that the if you switch it to a group of men and a group of women the
(1:34:43) women don't have the leverage of violence at all so it's not even violence against violence it's literally violence against uh a bunch of uh people
(1:34:51) who can't fight right they're going to annihilate them so what the what the feminists need and they still need today
(1:34:57) they're saying down with the patriarchy down with the patriarchy the reason that they're chanting is because they know
(1:35:03) they don't have any power hold on wait do you do you deny that like
(1:35:08) protests can be effective and protest can help change hearts and minds and things of that nature yes it it changes
(1:35:14) the minds of men and therefore men do that but like I don't but I don't see how that's like I don't know trying to
(1:35:20) change the minds of people who have more power and I agree men have more privilege in society because of that i'm
(1:35:26) saying that with a certain amount of privilege comes a responsibility to defend those who are more Hold on okay i
(1:35:33) grant that and I agree with you from my worldview men because of their ontology
(1:35:39) and their nature they have different duties than women right now even if you find some alternative and some
(1:35:45) exceptions I know your brain goes to exceptions right i'm granting all the exceptions i'm just saying generally speaking there is a a pretty clear
(1:35:52) threshold between what would seem to be the duty of men from both of our perspectives you're saying well men
(1:35:59) given that they have the ability maybe they should have the duty to protect these things what I'm asking what I'm
(1:36:05) asking for is the counter um the counter deontology the the what
(1:36:12) is the duty and the obligation of the women if we you and I both agree that
(1:36:18) the duty and obligation of the man is to protect not men people who are people who are stronger than others and I agree
() 
(1:36:23) generally men fine but it's not virtue why do you do this because it's not in virtue of the fact that they're men I
(1:36:28) would think that a stronger woman would have that same duty that the men has to
(1:36:35) defend a someone who is weaker than they are regardless of whether they're male or female so ju you're right that there
(1:36:41) are differences between men and women that generally result in men being stronger but it's not necessarily the
(1:36:48) case look you're like 61 2 61 i'm like 5'11 5'11 okay okay so let's say let's
(1:36:55) say you uh are walk dating a woman who can beat you in arm wrestling and it's
(1:37:01) kind of funny like sure it's just people know about it it's like they make funny or whatever you're walking down the street yeah
(1:37:07) there is someone being aggressed by a strong man let's say it's a a smaller woman who's aggressed by a man and
(1:37:13) you're across the street does she now have the obligation above you if she's stronger than me yeah so
(1:37:19) you send your stronger who just she can beat you in a fight like a like arm wrestling she's she's beefier than you
(1:37:25) she can break something that you can't and you're going to say because of her strength only she's going to you send
(1:37:32) her to fight off the aggressor send her if she wants to go do that then yes what
(1:37:38) do you mean send her i don't have I don't have dominion over my house i understand we're talking about obligations i'm saying when I say she
(1:37:44) has the obligation fine then she would have the obligation stronger if I'm not stronger than the other person who's
(1:37:49) beating the person up no no you don't know if you're stronger than the other person but you know that your girlfriend in this case is stronger than you did
(1:37:56) they she has the obligation yeah how is that ridiculous if she I didn't say it was ridiculous i'm just I mean I feel
(1:38:02) like you're trying to I'm just saying I'm just saying to something I'm I'm pointing to that um that whoever's
(1:38:09) generally stronger you're saying in your ideal society of feminism has the obligation Okay yes okay i'm just going
(1:38:16) to grant that generally men have the obligation to defend and protect the
(1:38:22) less because they are strong yes because they're generally strong now um what does wi do women not not the exceptional
(1:38:30) woman your girlfriend in this case not her most of the women are are frailer they're petite u they're they're not
(1:38:37) prone to fighting they don't want to fight they run from a fight okay what
(1:38:42) what is their obligation to society uh pay taxes follow the laws provided
(1:38:47) they're just like I don't what do you mean everyone has obligations so just exist yeah what do you what do you think
(1:38:53) dude you Look I have it right I have it written right here individuals have the
(1:38:58) same rights equal opportunities and so on right you're trying to even the play the playing field we agree that men have
(1:39:04) the obligation they they are the force okay they're going to determine what ends up being law not they might have a
(1:39:11) war about it whatever men fight men if we accept that there's a duty aspect
(1:39:16) there this is the biggest crucial element of feminism as a as a general worldview i don't know if it's a fully
(1:39:22) fleshed out worldview but this is where it really thwarts people that I've debated is like if we agree on that part
(1:39:28) with the men i asked you what's the obligation for women if you think there
(1:39:33) should be some equal play here and you said guess what you said they just exist how is that contrary women just exist
(1:39:41) and get all the benefits of society that men provide and but yet you're going to
(1:39:46) fight against men being in power yeah how is this ridiculous i don't expect women to reward me for doing the bare
(1:39:54) minimum and not oppressing them like I just don't see your like "Women please reward me please like I'm I'm protecting
(1:40:00) you you should really be grateful cuz I could hit you at any moment." Like what the [ __ ] femin Yeah women should be grateful to men not trying to tear them
(1:40:07) down tear down the patriarchy why because I've already explained to the audience and you feminism and everything
(1:40:13) you think it includes as entitlements relies on the patriarchy you should act
(1:40:19) feminists should be proatriarchy they're pro- men not hurting women that
(1:40:24) is propatriarchy you're still appealing to You know if you're defining patriarchy I don't you Yeah men in power
(1:40:31) sure no power i mean what's men men having primary positions and not just physical power in in institutions of and
(1:40:38) they can change that with power with their force they could and women can't women could change it too by killing every one of their offspring well no
(1:40:44) that wouldn't that would just change that would just change the number of people that existed it wouldn't change the fact that men and men would die and
(1:40:50) then men would die out and civilization would so women could kill off so okay so here's we finally got to an obligation
(1:40:56) okay men under his feminist view men have the obligation to uphold uh law
() 
(1:41:03) society hold on defend rights defend the country because they're stronger generally women have the obligation to
(1:41:10) not kill their offspring well women have an obligation not to kill people generally the same way men
(1:41:16) don't have an obligation to kill people hold on a second is feminism mostly pro- killing your offspring or against it no
(1:41:21) you want to get into abortion no I'm asking you a question is feminist the nar the the feminist view is it is it
(1:41:27) sold as an empowering thing a right to kill your offspring or not um I think it's considered a right to have bodily
(1:41:34) autonomy yes okay so let's talk about it so if the men in this society we agree
(1:41:40) have the obligation because of their strength collectively to defend rights and I ask you what does a woman have the
(1:41:46) obligation to do it sounded like before they have the obligation to not off their offspring and themselves and yet
(1:41:53) feminism under your own view is men defending women to have the right to to
(1:42:00) have an abortion yeah to kill their offspring even though you just admitted that their obligation is to not kill
(1:42:05) themselves shouldn't kill their born offspring they shouldn't they they they shouldn't kill people who are outside of
(1:42:10) the womb we're not reliant on So when a woman's pregnant So when a woman's pregnant a man has the obligation to
(1:42:17) defend her rights to walk around and do anything and not get aggressed and defend her when she's aggressed by
(1:42:23) stronger people right and the obligation in return is that she can still
(1:42:28) annihilate the baby hold on so if we want to get into a conversation about abortion because I think it's very interesting no one has a right to use
(1:42:34) another person's bodily organs without their consent that's unt when does that happen what do you mean that's how our
(1:42:40) society structured okay cool so a woman who basically um So a woman who's
(1:42:45) sleeping and the baby rolls over and and suckles on the teeth what is that informed consent or what what are you
(1:42:51) What are you talking about the woman sleeping she didn't give consent to the baby rolling over and feeding on her okay fine what does that have to do with
(1:42:56) anything you just then if the woman doesn't want if a woman doesn't want to breastfeed her child then obviously
(1:43:01) parents both men and women have an obligation to feed their children and if a woman doesn't want to use her body in order to feed her children then she can
(1:43:08) find other ways to do so and if she doesn't want to feed her child she can put it up for Does the woman who's pregnant uh get the consent of the the
(1:43:14) fetus when it gives it her necessary stem cells what do you mean well it's
(1:43:19) not an autonomous being it can't do oh so it just can't decide at all but it's but the woman is still uh gaining types
(1:43:27) of nutrients for itself from the baby what does that have to do with anything well you're saying no it can't be
(1:43:32) otherwise you said no living being would you say living being has the right to take it without the consent because the
(1:43:38) baby's not capable of giving consent well baby's not capable of giving consent when it's when it's one week old
(1:43:45) either sure and I don't think you should I guess like So feeding a baby without its consent is wrong no why would I say
(1:43:52) that it's wrong you just said you have no right to violate one's consent you don't have a right to use someone's body
(1:43:58) bodily organs without their consent their bodily organs so yeah so kidney
(1:44:04) donation someone cannot forcibly let let's say that you know someone else needs your kidney to survive let's even
(1:44:10) say that you put them in a position where they require your kidney for survival as a society at least currently as we
(1:44:16) have structured it now it's not legal for them to take that from you without your consent if you hit someone with your car let's imagine and you know
(1:44:23) because of that you were driving recklessly and now they require you know your kidney in order to survive the state can obligate you to to donate your
(1:44:30) kidney to them you mean men sure yeah so again we're in a position where even
(1:44:36) your argument for consent being the ethical norm is still wholly reliant on the disparity of force and power between
(1:44:42) men and women when have I ever denied that that's like factually how things are but there's a difference between how things are and how things should be i
(1:44:49) want to get to the should how do you determine how things should be under feminism under feminism yeah because
(1:44:54) that's what's being defended tonight sure i'm defending feminism on the view that I think it leads to better outcomes for everyone okay so why
(1:45:02) ought Okay who determines what a good outcome is under feminism under feminism I don't society in general like I And
(1:45:09) what do you what are you saying like we're trying to appeal to universal moral standards here of like Well I'm
(1:45:14) not saying all feminists agree on outcomes you probably debate other fe feminists but it's like the if you're
(1:45:19) coming to the table and saying here's my idea of feminism and here's how I think society should be structured from a
(1:45:25) feminist position right um we already agreed that uh society can
(1:45:31) only be structured in in in a way that actually creates disparity it's descriptively so between men and women
(1:45:37) like that's the only way a society functions but what else are you arguing ought to be the case men should not use
(1:45:44) their power to oppress women i don't know how this is so hard for you to understand what do you mean oppress
(1:45:49) women to exert their will on women with force just because you're stronger than someone doesn't mean that you should use
(1:45:55) that power to make them submit to your will like I don't see why what how does
(1:46:01) that I mean that seems to be happening more more with men what do you mean yeah men should not also kill or coersse or
(1:46:09) cause violence against other men i mean women get a vote that not directly but indirectly uh a woman's position uh
(1:46:16) through a vote could actually um result in men getting drafted sure i'm against
(1:46:22) the draft okay i'm against the draft entirely i think it violates the 13th amendment's clause of involuntary servitude okay but you would Yeah okay
(1:46:28) so you would agree that that was that would be a violation of of the man in that case and it shouldn't exist the
(1:46:34) draft shouldn't exist exist okay but that here's the thing is like if you're can you think of an instance where the
(1:46:40) draft should exist no really i don't so I think you can always incentivize
(1:46:45) people to fulfill that basic need so for example if people don't want to go to
(1:46:50) war um pay them more um have have it so that when they come back from war they are provided better maybe it would be
(1:46:56) less of an incentive to go to war if you don't know whether you're going to have a fighting force honestly I think that the scenarios in which to draft the dire
() 
(1:47:04) situation that a draft would be necessary it was Vietnam i don't think money would be the the last one was
(1:47:10) Vietnam though like that was a war that was a terrible decision to go to war over yeah well I mean if you don't if
(1:47:17) it's I mean I'm fine with you just opposing the draft because some people go they basically ask well you know when
(1:47:23) is you know where's the disparity in equality between men and women you know descriptively i've already established
(1:47:29) that but that's one thing that we can always go to where they're like well well then make it legal to draft women
(1:47:35) and we're arguing you shouldn't draft anyone like we we shouldn't want I I don't want that either now let's talk
(1:47:41) about um um standards like if equal do you agree that when you argue
(1:47:47) opportunity we are you agree that uh opportunities require capability right
(1:47:54) sure and if some people can't meet a standard then yeah they should not be in that position should people lower the standards for equality uh lower the
(1:48:01) standards let's say firefighter police officer Navy Seals no I don't think so you should not lower standards however
(1:48:07) it doesn't there there is not a standard of brute strength in order to occupy most positions in society that aren't
(1:48:13) enforcementbased yeah I wouldn't I'm not arguing the counter to feminism isn't necessarily arguing keep women out of
(1:48:21) things by force it's it's that it's countering one a descriptive claim
(1:48:26) that's false that assumes women have the same uh duties or even power as men um
(1:48:32) and two the um what should the question is a should versus a should should we
(1:48:39) prioritize women uh doing what they're really good at well if it's the case that women are not homogeneous grouping
(1:48:47) women but I'm going to reject that every time if it's the case that women are mostly good at certain things I don't I
(1:48:55) don't think that's necessarily true i don't think women are inherently better at taking care of children than men
(1:49:01) no they're not inherently better no men can do men can do that too well I'm
(1:49:08) not saying it's not capability like one or the other it's that is that is there
(1:49:14) a better scenario is it a better scenario that men are put in certain um
(1:49:20) no duty positions than than others than than women is it better that we have a
(1:49:26) fighting force that is comprised of these strongest individuals yes and if it turns out that the strongest individuals because of facts of biology
(1:49:33) are overwhelmingly male then sure here's the thing is if if the men we agree that
(1:49:40) if collectively men are best used um to be like the the general
(1:49:46) enforcement arm in one aspect sure yeah but what's that for women because I'm not not even talking about duties
(1:49:52) anymore what is that for women there isn't necessarily symmetry here you're really not going to say that perhaps the
(1:49:58) equal um the equal parallel to men raising kids no okay i'm not so So
(1:50:05) you're okay i don't think it's the case women are not I just I just don't understand how from your feminist view that you're defending i'm not I just
(1:50:11) don't understand how you could look at what's needed right now um as far as
(1:50:18) human beings and looking at it and and obviously coming to the conclusion that what's demonstrated in the past is that
(1:50:25) women in the home raising kids is a functional let's even go pragmatism it's
(1:50:32) extremely pragmatic for women in their nurturing uh in their nurturing trait to
(1:50:38) they're not more nurturing than men inherently biologically no collectively uh because society socializes in such a
(1:50:44) way yes oh they're socialized to do that yes so women weren't nurturing before societies had like I don't know modern
(1:50:51) propaganda and all stuff hold on societal norms have existed without mass
(1:50:56) media wait a second just happens to be the case that almost every society that we look at happens to construct women to
(1:51:03) be nurturing mothers so I think the reason that women are often given that role is because of the proximity to
(1:51:10) children that they have considering they grow them i'm not but that that it's not that that ought to be the case just
(1:51:15) because of that i didn't say ought i said is it better no not necessarily why can't men men could raise the kids too
(1:51:22) okay so do you think that a woman has a child it's better for her to stay in the home or do an equal swap with the with
(1:51:28) the Let's say let's say a husband and a wife Hold on hold on let's say a man and a wife have the same exact skill and
(1:51:35) ability to to work a job yes a woman just has a child right yes all right and
(1:51:42) you're saying it's an eitheror situation that he goes that she goes back to the job and he stay home correct what
(1:51:48) whatever is whatever is best for their preferences if if the man wants to work um it would also depend on who's who is
(1:51:54) better at raising a child and I don't think it's always the case that the woman would be better there are some men that are more nurturing than women so if
(1:52:00) the men man is better capable of nurturing that child then the man should be the one to stay home well how would
(1:52:05) you know i mean what if it what if the preference is to do it but he's not as good then I think that there there's
(1:52:10) always going to be a trade-off between what's best for the child and what's best for the parents i don't think that always we must do everything that is
(1:52:18) completely in the best interest of our children to the utmost degree okay i'm going to ask you a hypothetical how
(1:52:23) would you know that your view of feminism was realized what do you mean realized you know like actualized like
(1:52:30) right now for instance you agree if there weren't people calling to abolish uh women having the right to vote that
(1:52:35) would be a good start abolish the Yeah but Yeah but I we already went over this like to get the
(1:52:42) right to vote they had to suppress and silence women okay so what if women what
(1:52:47) if women collectively said we don't want Hold on hold on what if women cuz you're talking about what what your standard
(1:52:54) right now is that the actualization one one instance of actualizing your view of feminism is that um women uh outright
(1:53:03) have the right to vote what if women went against you and they said I don't want the right to vote as a total then
(1:53:09) sure then I don't if if if collectively women all come together and say they don't want the right to vote I'm not
(1:53:15) going to stand in their way there there's a reason we don't we don't there's a reason we don't see that right now okay so why why would then you be
(1:53:22) against a bunch of men getting together and saying that women don't have the right to vote because they're taking
(1:53:28) away rights that aren't their own wait no hold on if there's a group of women who got together and they dominated uh
(1:53:35) collective there was like 75 80% of Then hold on hold on then maybe hold on then
(1:53:40) maybe I misspoke i don't think that I Yeah then then I I don't think that people should be able to like vote away
(1:53:46) rights of others yeah but why should why if you don't think you should vote away the rights of others why do you think
(1:53:52) you should be able to vote in the rights of others what do you mean those things could change it you had a right to you
(1:53:58) had a right to own a slave at one point you're saying you don't think you should have vote away the right for something
() 
(1:54:03) hold on you don't believe that hold on the right to own a slave and the right to vote are two very different a right is simply an allowance that's given to
(1:54:10) people as an entitlement with no obligation that groups of men with guns
(1:54:16) allow or don't allow so was there a time where technically you had the right to own another person are we are we talking
(1:54:22) morally are we talking like descriptively sure if you want to if you want to talk about rights in the sense of what was the case and and was just
(1:54:29) the case then and yeah sure there was a there was a society recognized right to own another human but you said you said
(1:54:36) you don't have the right to take someone's right away fine then if you want to argue that I'm being sloppy with
(1:54:41) language that's fine then sure then what's happening though if people do something and they take it away and they
(1:54:47) call it a right then they call it a right i can't tell them not to call it something i can still say what they're doing is wrong they shouldn't do that
(1:54:53) understand yeah Oliver I understand you're you're basically bound to the
(1:54:59) language we have but if the thing you're appealing to is rights and we can point to rights that are unjust I'm not sure
(1:55:06) what exactly you're rights then I'm I'm appealing to people's individual autonomy and well-being to make decisions about their own lives i don't
(1:55:12) I don't think other people should be the dictators of what other people's lives are yeah but if if you don't think that
(1:55:20) other people should dictate how other people's lives are if there's a whole group of people who don't agree that
(1:55:27) rights exist you're going to count you're going to contradict that too what do you mean if there's a bunch of people
(1:55:33) right now in the US who say "I don't believe rights exist." Okay you are
(1:55:39) going to be on the side that says "No we're actually going to still use force." And you could try to behave as
(1:55:44) though rights don't exist and you could believe that but that's actually we're going to force the belief of rights onto
(1:55:49) you right yeah we're going to force good things good things over bad things cool if I think it's a good thing like this
(1:55:56) is the thing this Yeah you're right it's just a whoever has the most power dude if your entire ethical paradigm just
(1:56:02) reduced here right now in the moment to whoever has the power and their
(1:56:07) preferences rule out as long as you have the power to rule it out you agree that under even your own standard that if a
(1:56:14) bunch of men got together and uh went back on giving the women the right and they thought it was good that they could
(1:56:21) argue that it was good it was even better for women than than they thought then you wouldn't really have uh it's
(1:56:27) totally consistent with your ethical position right sure i guess I'm not fully understanding i'm I'm asking whether
(1:56:34) it's consistent under your ethical system where the majority of people decide that what's best is well we're
(1:56:41) going to actually go back on the 19th amendment and women don't realize it at the moment right but it's actually going
(1:56:46) to be better for them it's going to it's going to make them safer it's going to make them happier if they really thought that I think they're wrong i I don't I I
(1:56:53) don't think we should be infantilizing people on the basis that men know what's best for women i think that's just not
(1:56:58) No I didn't say that that it is like it could be or couldn't be i'm just saying the activity of doing it is consistent
(1:57:05) with your ethical paradigm that it wait that it would happen or that it should happen no that it could it wouldn't be
(1:57:10) counter to your view what do you mean counter to my descriptive view or normative view your standard your
(1:57:15) normative view is this if a a bunch of women decide we they don't want the vote
(1:57:21) and they overpower overpop populate the women who think they want the vote they should then fine no then they shouldn't
(1:57:26) vote if they don't want to vote don't vote no no they don't even want other women to vote well no then why why are
(1:57:33) you trying to take away other people's ability to vote well no they just want they believe that it's not a good thing
(1:57:38) okay then don't vote i don't I don't I I don't care if you don't think it's a good thing i don't know why if someone
(1:57:44) is subject to the laws if someone is subject to how they are being governed then they should be represented in that process yeah but that why why don't
(1:57:50) people under the system have the right to establish a majority view that
(1:57:56) informs law that removes entitlements how does it remove entitlements how
(1:58:03) men's entitlement to have dominion over women no dude any entitlement you look
(1:58:08) at is provided and it can be overturned right sure what I don't I don't really
(1:58:13) see you're just saying I get it whoever has more power is able to do what they want what do where do we go from here uh
(1:58:19) well what's interesting where we go is if we both agree that the descriptively it's the case that whoever has the power
(1:58:27) does what they want the only question between everybody in the political spectrum whoever you debate libertarians
(1:58:34) Christians Trumpers progressives commies the only question from my view is whose
(1:58:41) ethical paradigm is informing the force is that fair i guess okay
(1:58:49) okay cool yeah whoever has we we we've established a conclusion over and over whoever whoever can do what they want
(1:58:55) can do what they want we're at a tutology here and I don't disagree with you that whoever has the most power can
(1:59:00) do what they want the question isn't what can they do it's what they should do i know that's why I'm saying
(1:59:06) ultimately all of these debates come down to including the feminist debate
(1:59:11) who should have the power and whose worldview should inform the use of force sure so under a feminist view being that
(1:59:18) here's here's another aspect of feminism that I've debated against that it doesn't have it doesn't have a normative
(1:59:24) authority or or standard to say you're being a good feminist or a true feminist right or a false one for instance I mean
(1:59:32) feminists disagree on so much that I don't really I don't know I I I also wouldn't claim to be the like authority
(1:59:37) on feminist that's fine just go out on a ledge like if if if a feminist if a woman is like I think that a woman's
(1:59:44) proper role is in the home and I don't think that she should have the right to vote and women who do that are going against being a woman i would say that
(1:59:50) that's pretty counter to every single what if they said that was what I'm pointing to is there's that feminism
(1:59:55) itself is um is basically pluralism like even among feminists like so if if a
(2:00:02) woman came to the table a tradition a trad mom right she can live in the home she can say that's feminist right
(2:00:09) sure it kind of is because she's asserting her own choice and autonomy to do with what with her life what she
(2:00:14) wants right so that is I guess yeah you can be a feminist and want to be a stay-at-home Those two things are not so
(2:00:21) it could happen in the next 20 years where feminism the the last stage of
(2:00:26) feminism as we know it could be back to the home right if women collectively
(2:00:31) decided that that is what they wanted to do and they didn't think that other women who didn't do that were somehow
(2:00:39) failing in their womanhood then sure could it be feminist to be submissive to
(2:00:45) your husband if a woman wants to make that decision sure but it would depend on what you mean by submissive would it
() 
(2:00:51) be okay first would it would it would it mean that he you are kind of giving away some permanent kind of stake that you
(2:00:58) have like so once you decide to be submissive to your husband would that entail that you can never not be submissive or could you go back on that
(2:01:04) arrangement and be like "No you know what i've been submissive to you for a while i've decided that this is not a paradigm that I like i'm not going to do
(2:01:10) that." Yeah well that that's why probably there's so many divorces is that um I want to blame it fully on that
(2:01:17) but I would say individualism both from the men and the woman perspective i think I think feminism is rooted in
(2:01:22) individualism and I think individualism is actually uh uh ba basically a net
(2:01:28) loss for society because what you get is people pursuing their own individual preferences wants desires above the any
(2:01:36) view of a collective and I would call the family one of the more local collectives and so I think that
(2:01:42) individualism in the home for instance um I don't think people should be individualistic in the home i fully
(2:01:48) agree with you people People should if they have children especially if they have families you should absolutely prioritize the well-being of your family
(2:01:53) to an extent okay what if the man What if the man decides what's the best well-being for the family is X and they
(2:02:00) vote this way and the woman having the right to vote cancels out his vote well then yeah that's how it should be people
(2:02:07) it should Yeah they should just cancel each other out yeah what What do you What What How is that counter two people
(2:02:13) voting oppositely do cancel each other out i know but it they represent the same house and people who represent the
(2:02:18) same house can disagree now granted is it better that the heads of two houses are in disagreement i actually would
(2:02:25) agree that I don't think it is which is why I think certain political differences that if you have them you should not marry someone who contradicts
(2:02:31) your core values well I'm just wondering why would it why would it be an advantage uh um to give the woman the
(2:02:39) vote inside the house and not just give it to the man anyway like what would be the advantage what do you what the
(2:02:45) advantage what's the advantage of giving women the right to vote inside a house where it splits the vote it splits the
(2:02:51) because the man could be wrong the man could be wrong about what he wants we should not assume that men know
(2:02:57) what's best because they don't a lot of the time well I know but that you could just reverse that and say the woman was wrong but but I'm saying what's the
(2:03:03) advantage though because because to me there's an advantage there's even an advantage for the man being wrong and
(2:03:10) there being a consequence to him being wrong what's the consequence of him being wrong well if he if he votes on
(2:03:16) based on the House he's he is the representative of the House right right no he's a representative of himself i'm
(2:03:22) sorry you just You're claiming that No hold on you're claiming whatever he does is therefore representative of the House
(2:03:28) that doesn't mean that he's voting in the best interest of the House i didn't say the best interest but he's certainly not representing just himself when
(2:03:34) you're a father you're going to realize this right even voting voting at the local level you're going to realize that your influence and your your voice to
(2:03:41) vote at the local levels i completely it's going to reflect on you like you're basically speaking on behalf of your
(2:03:48) children sure and I don't think that adults should inherently or like spouses
(2:03:53) should inherently speak on behalf of their spouses and take away the ability for their spouse to speak for themselves
(2:03:58) yeah but why should let's give women then then the woman should be the rep
(2:04:04) this should be the representative of the house the woman only women voting i mean I under what why can't we do that
(2:04:09) instead well I what I would argue that women only voting like um I would say if
(2:04:14) women only vote then women only fight wars no why does that necessarily have to Well I would say that the the vote
(2:04:21) and you can go back to even Lord Chromemer uh who voting to conscription is stupid well no I'm saying that I use
(2:04:27) that as a hyperbole i was just saying that um even very early on when when
(2:04:32) women's votes were started to be the talk of the town very early on men realized and vocalized that that um that
(2:04:41) women because they can't enforce the policy that they're voting for they
(2:04:48) can't do it right they can't they can't enforce the policy they're voting for u certain weaker men can't no but men
(2:04:54) collectively can and women collectively can't okay than weaker men collectively can so why they should they shouldn't be
(2:05:00) able to vote i fine i concede but then you're conceding that that why should
(2:05:06) women vote right if you understand this logic I'm not advocating for everyone who's a man biologically should have a
(2:05:13) vote i would be the first to say maybe I don't think should have I should have a vote so So then who do we determine has
(2:05:18) the right to vote well we in the past there was actually a set of variables you were white and you were slave land
(2:05:25) owner it doesn't have to be just that it could be it could be uh yeah it could be landowning it could be like it makes
(2:05:30) sense though like look look look at it this way does everyone in the company who works for the company
(2:05:37) uh get a vote on the board well some people actually do believe that in terms of like you know democratizing does it happen though i mean ultimately no right
(2:05:45) no it doesn't because that's not not the economic system and and the reason that is is because the people sitting at the table actually put skin in the game
(2:05:52) right so there's risk well but they what risk are they putting forward well they sometimes they put money they put
(2:05:57) resources and what happens if they don't well if if they lose they lose that money that they put and then what do they do well they could vote or get
(2:06:04) kicked out or whatever no no i mean if they if if if someone puts forward risk Yeah in in terms of starting a business
(2:06:09) and something like that and it fails yeah and their business fails what do they do start over start over or get a
(2:06:15) job as as a labor so they're not risking anything that the other people who are already laborers are not already forget
(2:06:21) it there dude there's already a loss the fact that they can do something else doesn't remove the fact that there was a loss i'm not saying what they're not
(2:06:27) losing i'm saying what's the loss for uh the the person who has no skin in the
(2:06:32) game skin in the game is a phrase you know the phrase right why don't you think women have a skin in the game in the society that we live in they don't
(2:06:38) have a skin in the game because they don't have to enforce anything i and this is the I think maybe this maybe
(2:06:43) this comes down to disagreement we're getting at i don't think that shaping society even fundamentally or primarily
(2:06:50) comes down to who is stronger i think ideas are so much
(2:06:56) get a vote because she lives in a society and is subject to the laws no if
(2:07:01) the society determines that she shouldn't have a vote that doesn't that's just circular i'm saying why is it the case that Hawkua why should
(2:07:10) Andrew Tate have a right to vote if maybe he shouldn't okay so then what yeah you agree with me with the inquiry
(2:07:16) why is it that you have an immediate defense to voting isn't it Oliver possible that our voting structure
(2:07:22) currently so then you're just collapsing this into monarchy then monarchy I think monarchy is pretty cool okay well but
(2:07:29) but voting itself like certainly if voting meant that you were going to influence policy both both domestically
(2:07:35) and foreign you would perhaps understand the system perhaps understand some level
(2:07:41) of policy most men don't i understand that that's why dude you already got me to concede that I don't think most men
(2:07:47) should vote but certainly the men who have skin in the game no collectively
(2:07:54) men I would say collectively men who who offer their body in service that they
(2:07:59) could die whether women offer their body in service of birthing these men yeah that's the only leverage they have no
(2:08:05) hold on but that seems like pretty powerful and important leverage right well no they can't enforce the rights
(2:08:10) though cuz voting no cuz voting Hold on voting is their kids no that's not enforcing rights how what do you mean
(2:08:17) how is not having a kid enforcing right i absolutely think it can be a very powerful leveraging tool if we talk about it and what is it if like if if
(2:08:23) women all collectively say if you don't give I mean some people are saying if you don't give us the right to do this then we're going to not have children
(2:08:31) yeah 4b yeah they're all ugly no one wants to have children with that wait a second that's not I mean it's true well but what does that what does that prove
(2:08:37) that doesn't It proves that just like the suffragette movement who are a bunch of goblins who couldn't find men okay
(2:08:43) just seriously okay what does that do it's just what it just properly identifies the actual problem which is
(2:08:49) which is women who actually uh put themselves out there with the hopes and the desire to be found by a man to be
(2:08:56) taken care of will in return give them children raise their kids for them and then return be respected and be taken
(2:09:02) care of largely society was this in fact what's so crazy about the feminist movement is
(2:09:09) that before all these goblins came on the screen the scene is that women were actually revered they were protected
() 
(2:09:15) they were they were let out to be in the home and guess what guess what benevolent benevolent fine it's fine
(2:09:21) benevolent slavery yeah benevolent slavery beautiful okay well could be i don't know how we I don't know how we
(2:09:27) come to an impass where you think that certain people having their autonomy restricted is how we should operate look
(2:09:34) it's not even there's only certain things that are restricted by the way a society of rights and entitlements your
(2:09:40) autonomy is restricted all the time all of course I'm not saying it's not so what's the difference between in the street and in the home dude what do you
(2:09:47) mean what's the difference between your autonomy being restricted right here out on the street and a woman's being
(2:09:53) restricted in the home what is the difference between if mine is restricted in the home why shouldn't mine be restricted in the home if a society is
(2:10:00) based on restrictions of course it is then I don't understand why you're picking and choosing between one and the
(2:10:06) other what's the threshold what's the what's the what's the um what do they call it yeah i think you should have to pay taxes but I don't think people
(2:10:12) should be able to steal your bodily organs okay like I don't I don't you know what I mean like this this gets
(2:10:17) down to the whole libertarian argument taxation is slavery because taxing your labor okay but then there are certain
(2:10:23) therefore then there are certain entitlements that are fair entitle over things that you are that you owe such as
(2:10:29) a portion of your income to ensure that society continues but you don't have to donate bodily tissue or you don't have to donate your blood or something like
(2:10:35) that i mean I I myself I know this is a feminist debate but I myself might
(2:10:40) actually violate uh consider violation of autonomy for for certain things but I
(2:10:47) don't know exactly where that is but I'm willing and and it is ambiguous but what we can we at least hopefully agree on is
(2:10:53) there seems to be some line there there we don't know exactly where the line is but there there is a certain balance
(2:10:59) between freedom and autonomy that exists that society has to be at okay but here's the thing what is being
(2:11:06) ultimately violated if you repeal the 19th amendment what do you mean what
(2:11:12) ultimately is like what's ultimately being violated like what's the big their right to have representation in
(2:11:19) the society in which they live and that they are affected what do you mean representation
() 
(2:11:25) they should be represented in the government why should Hawktua be represented in the government pay taxes and follow the laws wait a second wait a
(2:11:32) second hawk Tua can spit spit on that thing and and because Hold on and
(2:11:38) because she can spit on that thing and we live in a shitty degenerative society that prioritizes garbage your view is
(2:11:46) because Hawk Tua I don't have to agree with that hold on hakua can spit on it and because she made some money on
(2:11:53) spitting on it that she should be able to no inform with her vote things she doesn't understand most people it's not
(2:12:00) about understanding it's so you're saying it doesn't matter to understand no because and I agree with you democracy is a fundamentally flawed
(2:12:06) system it's pile of trash okay but and this is what Churchill said is democracy is the worst form of government except
(2:12:13) for all the others there is not a better system there's not a better system out there no i mean you're saying
(2:12:19) sympathetic to monarchy then you were saying that you were sympathetic to one person making those determinations well no uh you could have a monarchy and the
(2:12:26) one person making the determination requires some external uh view or paradigm that's higher than them as a
(2:12:32) person who has preferences wait what do you mean like a Christian monarchy okay the the person at the top the king um if
(2:12:38) he went outside the normative authority of of his ethics and he started to run
(2:12:44) around with his preferences which would be an individualist uh view um then they
(2:12:49) wouldn't they he like that's how you get rid of those people it's like you can have that right and it's not uh locked
(2:12:56) into this view that you're just sitting on your own throne of preferences the way it's always depicted right isn't it
(2:13:02) possible that a monarchy could exist that's informed by something larger than the individual sitting in the seat
(2:13:08) ideally yes okay but I'm saying that there's no way to know that that's not going to collapse into that individual
(2:13:14) they want and that's what largely happens in in dictatorship i think it also depends on how long it takes to
(2:13:19) collapse for me because the topic is feminism what I've seen since the
(2:13:25) feminist movement started in all of its phases and there are people on the right wing the conservatives they're actually
(2:13:30) classical liberals who think well no the feminism we have now is trash but the the early phase no I'm saying it's all
(2:13:37) bad it's not good for society because it results in more individualism and it
(2:13:44) collapses the integrity of what makes a society and the the integrity that makes a society is families okay if you are
(2:13:51) against individualism which frankly I could say to an extent I am against as well you should be against it for men
(2:13:57) and women i Well yeah it doesn't okay so then if men don't have the right if women don't have the right to vote and
(2:14:03) exercise their preferences in that way then then men should not have that right i I'm fine it's just when you get to
(2:14:09) voting I'm totally fine with listing some sort of uh components or or
(2:14:14) attributes like on a baseball card like Yeah so then some of it would have to be in form informing things
(2:14:19) time if some women were sufficiently informed and could pass a citizenship test which I'm sure many can um do you
(2:14:25) think that Yeah then then they should have the right to vote no okay well then it's not based on that well it' be first
(2:14:31) it would be first the prerequisite is to be a man okay well then that's just why
(2:14:38) uh because they're a part of the category where it could be the case where they're going to actually um you know risk their bodies so the well women
(2:14:46) also risk their bodies children yeah but I I would make it a duty they don't have a duty to though this is where this is
(2:14:52) where they don't have a duty to have children no no sorry from my point of view
(2:14:57) Christian ethical paradigm the duties for men and women are different and because the duties are different their
(2:15:03) place in society and what they're uh expected to do and where they find themselves are are they they vary from
(2:15:09) your perspective which is largely sort of like a liberal um sort of like a like
(2:15:15) a individual it's still individualism though it's like you want people to pursue their own personal wants and
(2:15:20) desires regardless of what other people find uh appalling or like as long as
(2:15:26) it's legal you you go and do it right no not necessarily i think there Well I I mean I think there there are certain
(2:15:32) things that can be legal that I don't think people should do but I'm saying the result of that liberalism that that
(2:15:38) free liberalism the result of that like I think that feminism is largely
(2:15:43) intertwined with that that view like like for instance feminists aren't all
(2:15:50) um like Iron Rand fans or whatever but but the thing is ultimately ultimately
(2:15:57) the thing is do as thou wilt right regardless of your duties that's why the biggest criticism when you match up
(2:16:03) feminism with any other view especially religious views that they don't have any
(2:16:09) duties and obligations there's zero for men and women there's nothing that
(2:16:14) grounds your duties well I think it's because in our society we don't have to
(2:16:20) specifically ground duties in what people ought to do especially with regards to reproduction people want to have kids
(2:16:28) that is a innate biological desire of both men and women and men and women
(2:16:33) will have children if they are given the opportunity to do so if they are given the financial resources to do so you
(2:16:40) don't have to force them to do it that's just not how Nobody said force yeah we're talking about duties you don't
(2:16:45) have women do not have to be relegated to the home in order for there to be children wait a second in order for you
(2:16:51) keep using this force as if people are going to force people we're talking about you're going to take the right to
(2:16:56) vote away take the right to you already agreed that that could happen and still be consistent with your view no it
() 
(2:17:02) wouldn't yeah it would you already you already conceded that under your view if it were the case that women
(2:17:07) collectivized and they said you know what we don't want the right to vote you said well just don't vote no if the
(2:17:12) women voted to have it completely repealed that would be fair under the democratic system you can vote yeah of
(2:17:19) course democracy can lead to authority how's that inconsistent with your your view though it's not It's not
(2:17:24) inconsistent of course they vote their own rights away yeah well absolutely okay cool so so if women disagree here
(2:17:31) so well that's what I'm saying if women could vote their rights away to vote if it happened men could vote their rights
(2:17:37) away yeah so you should be fine with that right so I mean the ideal I'm saying in defending democracy you don't
(2:17:44) have to defend every part of what could happen in a democratic system dem
(2:17:50) democracy is the best version of government it can sometimes go astray and it can sometimes lead to bad outcomes and we're not it's just saying
(2:17:57) that's that's part of the reality that we live in unfortunately unfortunately that could happen yeah but even democracy itself is in a type of a
(2:18:04) contradiction is what democracy itself is in a type of contradiction if it
(2:18:10) can't produce something that's not itself what do you mean i'm saying that if democracy can produce all outcomes
(2:18:18) except for ridding itself of democracy i mean it can okay it can but can it hear it could the question of whether it
(2:18:24) could still democracy yeah people can democratically vote away their power that's how Hitler got into
(2:18:30) office okay so if it's still democratic right sorry maybe I shouldn't say that that's I I think you can say that okay
(2:18:36) if if uh if that's the see I don't understand that seems to be like
(2:18:42) something that's crucial to the view itself because every feminism is all downstream from uh you have the
(2:18:49) entitlement and entitlements are down you know are rights and then rights give you this uh voice and then the voice
(2:18:56) gives you a vote and the voice and then the vote gives you a policy and so on and so on okay i I don't understand why
(2:19:04) we're under the assumption that this is something like worth defend like would you would you die to defend this system
(2:19:10) defend what democracy voting just the whole system uh against anything
(2:19:16) alternative that you didn't know the outcome of sure yeah i mean in terms of like authoritarianism yeah okay and
(2:19:22) authoritarianism you would define how do you know you're in an authoritarian system how do I know I'm in an
(2:19:29) authoritarian system i guess when people's constitutional rights are being violated um when uh you know individuals
(2:19:35) are not respecting the checks and balances of the government that are currently being set up or are in place
(2:19:41) but aren't those things authoritarian what do you mean they're authoritarian those structures how are they authoritarian you can have democracy
(2:19:47) with safeguards I'm not saying do democracy is not direct when we talk about democracy it's it's always a trade-off between absolute complete mob
(2:19:55) rule will people and some safeguards to ensure it doesn't go ary that's kind what a constitution and that's kind of
(2:20:01) what the Bill of Rights is that's what the Supreme Court that's what I'm saying is like everything is authoritative in the end and all everything every view
(2:20:08) you balance it I know but that's that's where it comes into play is that if the
(2:20:13) topic of the debate is feminism is good for society or not i'm not I'm still not sure how feminism
(2:20:21) produces an ethical framework that anyone should appeal to at all feminism doesn't produce an ethical framework
(2:20:28) feminism is just a description of it doesn't produce an ethical framework it's based on an ethical framework okay
(2:20:35) but it just doesn't produce it feminism is not a metaethical theory okay so there is there is a framework that's
(2:20:40) judging feminism sure and you're saying feminism according to this view is good
(2:20:47) what's that view feminism like what what is determining that feminism is good at
(2:20:52) a certain point some type of moral objectivism but I don't know exactly what kind of moral objectivism that is
(2:20:58) so wait a second i I can't hold on Oliver i can't justify the axioms of logic oliver if you're coming to a
(2:21:06) debate and saying feminism is good for society feminism feminism is a type of
(2:21:12) an apparatus and the thing that's judging it in this case you are holding the metric view is saying this is good
(2:21:18) for society so you are the metaethical view right is it just your preferences
(2:21:23) no it's not i could be wrong and other I could I'm not this this doesn't collapse into relativism because what what your
(2:21:30) what any other kind of objective view I mean one that appeals to God one that appeals to this just says "Yeah that's
(2:21:36) right because God says it's right and therefore I'm going to ground it in it being right because of that." So it's it's masking this isn't that still
(2:21:42) better than a pluralistic feminism where uh two feminists could coexist having completely counteractive preferences and
(2:21:49) still be called feminists well you can have counteractive preferences but what they would agree on is both of them are living valid expressions of womanhood
(2:21:57) well I mean that that would the agreement if one of them believes that the other should be legally prevented
(2:22:04) from doing that or something like that then yeah they then they would not be a feminist okay so it sounds like you're
(2:22:09) now I I don't want to say shifting as like a like like you're dancing i'm just saying it sounds like what you're saying
() 
(2:22:16) now is feminism is about the expression of w womanhood i mean it's the expression of
(2:22:24) I don't know it's it's the expression of saying that that people should not be defined by their sex or gender that they
(2:22:30) should not be that they should not have their rights they should not have their privileges like taken away because of
(2:22:35) Oliver if all of the men in power we agree it's a collective of strong men in power they can do that they shouldn't i
(2:22:41) don't why are we No no no hold on hold on if all of those men declared that
(2:22:46) they were women would it still be a Would it still be men in power would it be still be men in power do you want to
(2:22:52) get into the woman question is that what you want to do well I'm I don't know your view i'm just wondering if there's
(2:22:57) a group of of biological males who hold a position of enforcement and power in a society if those you point to them right
(2:23:04) cuz the feminists are saying we're being oppressed that's the whole point it starts with the assumption that they're
(2:23:10) being oppressed well what are they being oppressed by by a patriarchy okay those are men right yeah well if men
(2:23:17) can be not men we we can get into that i So I mean I don't I'd be happy i wrote a lot about this idea of like what a woman
(2:23:24) is and and the reality is I actually don't think that it is possible to uh provide a set of necessary and
(2:23:31) sufficient conditions for womanhood or manhood or what is a man or what is a woman that includes all the people we
(2:23:36) would normally think of as women and all the people that we'd normally think of as men so how would you and this is a really interesting question how would
(2:23:42) you define a woman a woman someone who has the uh developmental pathways uh
(2:23:48) toward having ovaries and and giving birth even if they didn't fully develop okay so there are certain individuals
(2:23:53) who don't have that because the the No the pathway is always there the pathway isn't necessarily Have you heard of something like there's something like
(2:23:58) squire syndrome so Sawyer syndrome no the the pathway is always tilted one direction or the other and that one is
(2:24:04) tilted towards male in that case i can provide the case of Sawyer syndrome for you because I had it down as as an
(2:24:10) example so um Sawyer syndrome these individuals have XY chromosomes but during development the SRY gene
(2:24:16) responsible for sex differentiation doesn't activate meaning these individuals have external female genitalia and have present but
(2:24:23) underdeveloped uterus and fallopian tubes puberty will not occur in these individuals unless they are given hormone replacement are you pointing to
(2:24:29) the um XY as the No I don't I don't appeal to that i understand that people
(2:24:35) have I don't feel some people would be some people who are some people who are XY would be classified as women under
(2:24:40) your view well no they we're looking at the pathway of development not XY sure
(2:24:46) so then because even though they have XY there is a pathway because of the lack of the down to categorize yeah to
(2:24:53) properly categorize yeah it's a B it is a binary in the end they'd be categorized as women okay i mean I I'm
(2:24:59) I'm still working out my exact view on the But the thing is the thing is I know you've you're probably debating this
(2:25:04) stuff a lot it it is relevant to feminism because we're in a phase now where if everything you thought was
(2:25:11) oppressive that was based on a binary of male and female but you call that binary
(2:25:16) ma men are oppressing me you those people would have to remove the term men and say males are oppressing me only
(2:25:23) right well I think that men can still track something about about males yeah
(2:25:29) sure like I don't I think it can still track something without it exactly Do you think that there's actually a difference between a female and a woman
(2:25:37) i think society there can be I because I I for example I think there's different definitions we can use for words so I
(2:25:43) think that we can consider woman like almost every definition or every word that we use um has multiple definitions
(2:25:49) to it like that that just is the case but the question is when someone says
(2:25:54) "Oh they're a female but they're not a woman." You accept that i think that it would depend on what they mean by
(2:26:00) because woman and man can also be like gendered terms and someone is more manly or less manly i think women and men are
(2:26:06) are Yeah gendered terms i think you're referring to like feminine and masculine
(2:26:11) because you're referring to a reference but if someone says it's a construct like completely yeah my criticism of all
(2:26:19) of that stuff uh you know the Matt Walsh guy started the trend by just saying what is a woman whatever but in
(2:26:25) ultimately I'm pointing out that there's not really a reference for it what do you mean like a reference out in space
(2:26:32) that you can point to that's this thing called woman the thing that you're pointing to ends up being biologically
(2:26:37) informed like traits femininity daintiness it is well I I I think there
(2:26:42) can be some ambiguity there but it doesn't mean like nothing exists for example like I don't I I I don't think
(2:26:48) that just because we can't pin down like exactly kind of what it like essentially means to be but someone should be able
(2:26:54) to because if they said and you're not taking this position hard by the way um
(2:26:59) is that um if someone said no female is not the same as woman you're talking
() 
(2:27:05) about sex we're talking about gender that's the common on all the Tik Toks right I asked this question I'll ask you
(2:27:10) just because I I'm not I'm being charitable with you because it doesn't sound like you're you take a really hard stance on this but just to answer the
(2:27:17) question because it's funny um can a female be a transw woman can a female be
(2:27:25) a transwoman i'm I'm not I think largely my understanding of trans women are
(2:27:32) individuals who are biologically male who identify as as women so I guess no in a sense
(2:27:38) well yeah because if they were different it should be yes right like if if female
(2:27:44) wasn't identical to woman the answer to the question can a female be a transw woman the answer should be yes well no
(2:27:52) can a female be a biological male who identifies as a woman no because she's
(2:27:57) female well then we're reducing this is my point is that it reduces back to sex that's the thing that you're looking at
(2:28:03) as a reference not the If it were true that uh neither male or female is equal
(2:28:09) to man or woman they they can be swapped each of those because they're not identical to each other at all they're totally different categories then it
(2:28:17) would follow that a female biological female could be a trans woman they just simply declare it so they declare they
(2:28:23) identify as a male who became like I don't and look and this are the rules
(2:28:29) well this I and look I don't I don't claim to be an authority on this and I don't really my understanding of it is I
(2:28:34) don't and I I I think people who say like sex is changeable like I don't agree with that it's not it's not well they're starting to say that they didn't
(2:28:40) always say that but now it's and I I think there are people who are saying like sex is mutable or something like that i don't I don't I don't agree with
(2:28:46) that i think that so so I don't think that someone can say that like I identify as a biological male because
(2:28:52) that's not a category that relates to identity like those are kind of fixed
(2:28:58) biological facts and I don't I don't think it is I think someone can identify more or less with being a man or being a
(2:29:05) woman the reason I asked the reason I asked is that if you're coming to the table and arguing for feminism and the
(2:29:12) argument for feminism necessitates that there's an oppression happening and we've established that um then once you
(2:29:20) get into the territory where there's ambiguity of what a man and a woman is Mhm then you don't have much to argue in
(2:29:28) regards to correcting feminism i don't think that's true because you're basically arguing is because we can't
(2:29:34) point to an exact definite line between you know man and woman or exact
(2:29:39) definitive point therefore the difference is meaningless kind of right is that kind of what you're getting if
(2:29:44) there's no distinction soiety's paradox if there's no distinction are you familiar with the society's paradox this idea that for it's it's kind of the same
(2:29:50) thing of like the fallacy of the pile in a heap or something like that like how many grains of sand make it yeah like a
(2:29:56) wave yeah make a heap versus a pile and you don't have to say that oh exactly this many grains in order to say there's
(2:30:02) a difference between the two so I think there's a difference between women and men and I don't know if I and I don't
(2:30:08) think we have to necessarily go down to like an anatomical level in order to kind of I understand I know you're
(2:30:14) saying that you don't have to but I think that if you're going to claim that there's a thing called feminism
(2:30:21) and feminism doesn't apply to men or males that's specific to what you're
(2:30:27) calling feminism and feminism is this counter to this other power structure
(2:30:33) what's ironic and kind of wild is that the the whole like um you know I guess
(2:30:39) Peterson would be like the postmodern people are changing all the things you know that is leading people to not being
(2:30:46) able to argue for the injustice because the distinction doesn't exist i don't sure and I don't look I'm not you know
(2:30:53) you you have to ask other people this because that's not a position that I necessarily hold but here here's what I would here's what I would say in
(2:30:58) response just a little bit is when we're talking about like I think it's still possible even if maybe you don't agree
(2:31:04) that trans women ought to be classified as women in the sense that like I don't how how we ought to consider a woman I
(2:31:11) think that if people consider them women they could experience a type of
(2:31:16) oppression that women face because they're well because because they're viewed that For example here here's a really good example no someone someone
(2:31:22) can um experience um um discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation even
(2:31:27) if they aren't gay so let's assume that at work someone assumes you're gay because you got a margarita shirt on or something like that and they're making
(2:31:33) you know bad like let's even someone fires you on the basis of that they're like you're wearing a margarita shirt it must mean you're gay i hate gay people
(2:31:39) i'm going to fire you it's true that you could face that would basically kind of be you as I'm assuming you're straight
(2:31:44) or you straight you would be experiencing actually homophobia as a straight person so it could actually be
(2:31:50) possible that a trans woman would experience misogyny i understand what you're saying but there's a truth of the
(2:31:56) matter though sure of that of that scenario that's that's where it gets
(2:32:02) into trouble like for instance there are people who were who have this uh experience that they don't have a limb
(2:32:08) right i forget what they call it yeah alien yeah alien limb syndrome or something so they have this right and so if they have this experience let's say I
(2:32:16) discriminate against a person who actually doesn't have a limb right okay
(2:32:22) over there I just like don't ask them for help that's like a form like maybe they want me to ask them for help cuz
(2:32:27) they don't want to be like a burden or whatever but I don't I discriminated i just said "Oh the legless person i'm not going to ask them to help me." Okay
(2:32:34) there's a person next to him that believes they declared it so that they identify as not having a leg and they're
(2:32:40) offended that I didn't affirm okay see that's the I use that i I fine and look
(2:32:47) I and I'm going to probably say something that people on the left i think I I I I think there is a level of
(2:32:52) kind of like I don't know if craziness is the right word but I don't know accepting people expecting people to
(2:32:59) accept things that they intuitively see as just not the case immediately without question and just like just if you and
(2:33:07) if you don't accept that you are a bigot and you are bad i I'm against I'm don't
(2:33:12) and I don't think so and look I the the trans issue is something that frankly I
(2:33:18) try to stay away from mostly because I don't it's not that I'm like scared to speak on it because I think that I'm going to get cancelled by the left it's
(2:33:24) rather I don't I don't really think that there's much value I can provide to the
(2:33:30) conversation in terms of like what I don't I don't know like is it possible that biological males can feel like they
(2:33:37) are women i don't know be I don't know be sorry about that i I don't know because I'm not a biological male who
() 
(2:33:43) feels like a woman so I don't have that experience so I think I think gender dysphoria is a real thing this is what
(2:33:49) this is what this is what I have a problem with okay okay so there are people who say my son feels like a girl
(2:33:58) yeah okay yeah i I don't Yeah I don't agree with that okay but then I would ask even the the s person who's young or
(2:34:04) the person who's old they could be wrong i would ask how do you know what it feels like to be a girl
(2:34:10) um I think people look I don't I I think if people like know what it feels like to be a girl I think especially at those
(2:34:15) younger ages kids say stuff that like oh yeah I thought I was a I thought I was a monkey i I told my parent and I think I
(2:34:22) think it's possible also that if boys are expressing they want to be a girl they might just actually be expressing I
(2:34:27) like girls and I like girls they could be yeah so I so I'm a I'm I guess not of the view that like if a if a young boy
(2:34:35) expresses anything a desire to be in accordance with anything that is typically associated with the female sex that we should start treating him like a
(2:34:41) woman or start start identifying him as a woman right but that's the thing is like um to bring it back to feminism at
(2:34:49) least you acknowledge in order to have feminism you at least need uh a little
(2:34:55) bit more of a rigid position on categories between men and women because otherwise you couldn't argue that women
(2:35:01) are being oppressed if you can't tell me what any of those are well I don't I I I can understand the kind of
(2:35:08) appeal of that kind of like framework like how how can you be a feminist if you don't even know what a woman is but
(2:35:13) I think that it's also true that you can acknowledge that there's there is ambiguity between categories that there
(2:35:19) kind of is and there maybe might not necessarily always be a fact of the matter that we can like know like I
(2:35:25) don't know like how many how many grains of sand does it take to make I don't I think I think because you can point to a
(2:35:32) some threshold where you might find ambiguity i don't think that's what's going to inform all of our decisions
(2:35:39) it's more so that we're going to be informed by typical things right we don't we like like it might be the case
(2:35:46) we all see the red green and uh yellow lights at the stop sign differently but
(2:35:51) all some thresh uh some some frequency of those reflections but that wouldn't
(2:35:57) it wouldn't follow that we suddenly have to come up with names for each of the different ways and we see the yellow for
(2:36:02) everybody right sure so that's why I'm thinking like well my view which is counter to feminism is based on uh
(2:36:10) what's typical and what's typical um that's why force doctrine is argued so well is because you're arguing for
(2:36:17) what's typically the case descriptively you're not making a claim that it ought to be that way but feminism if it
(2:36:25) counters how it actually is I think the the strong statement I make is that feminism is actually a lie it's actually
(2:36:32) lying to women I no I I don't look I I don't I really I really don't see and
(2:36:39) you know you can try to explain it to me again how you're getting from the descriptive claim that you know because
(2:36:44) men are stronger they will like always be appealed to with force or like
(2:36:50) because they have force they will always need to be appealed to that that is like that that that in and of itself means
(2:36:57) that women should not have like the same opportunities to certain things i'm not look I'm not saying that women should
(2:37:03) have equal access to the military and we should completely absolve all standards to include them like that's not that's
(2:37:09) not what I'm getting at but I think there are certain fields for example like I I don't buy the idea that there
(2:37:14) are significant scientific differences between the intellects of men and women
(2:37:19) that justify excluding them from fields like the sciences so some of the data I was bringing up that I thought was important was that when there are mixed
(2:37:26) gendered teams it leads to more innovative research novel research and it leads to the the research being more
(2:37:32) influential and I think that's a good thing and that's why I think we should encourage more women to be involved in
(2:37:37) science men to be involved in science collaborate together do you want the smartest women to multiply themselves
(2:37:43) smartest women i think people in general Yeah i think I think I I think it's good for individuals to Okay well that's the
(2:37:50) thing is like even if you No one's arguing women we should stop it and they stop them from doing all these things
(2:37:56) it's just that what's happening is that the culture has reached a point where
(2:38:02) there's been so much shoved down the the men and women growing up in in uh public
(2:38:08) school that there's this like equality thing and then and then women should go pursue their dreams and they're they're
(2:38:14) steered away from childhood absent the parents at home countering what they're
(2:38:21) they're they're learning in school but let me just finish this is that if you just said well there's a bunch of smart
(2:38:27) women that were exceptions and I think they should be in the STEM fields and I think I don't think there exceptions though whatever it Well no there's
(2:38:33) there's smart people are exceptions for men and women in those fields the question I'm having is it even if you
(2:38:38) found the smartest people wouldn't it wouldn't it be beneficial for them to have children instead of Yeah to not
(2:38:44) instead No not not instead uh up to a point you're going to have to figure out what's more important for a women men
(2:38:50) and women are different in they're in different positions the reason is it's not just the force doctrine it's that
(2:38:56) women for them to fulfill uh on what let's say want to have kids for
() 
(2:39:02) them to fulfill on that there is a time period for men there's not as much well I think I think it's would be beneficial
(2:39:08) to society impose that type of time period so for example I think paternity leave should be something that is more
(2:39:14) widespread i think that What about permanent oh paternity oh no i'm saying
(2:39:20) I thought you meant maternity no paternity i think men should take time off work to be with their kids as well i
(2:39:26) think that's important i think men and women should spend time with their kids in their formative years i think that's beneficial so no you're just permanent
(2:39:33) maternity leave no I mean yeah you don't want women to work i I want Yeah i think I think I think there should be a
(2:39:39) massive cuz you think it's all force and I'm not arguing that most of the people I argue with uh who are on my side of
(2:39:46) the this uh argument aren't talking about force they're talking about
(2:39:51) reinstating massive levels of of propaganda essentially right that that
(2:39:58) shows the beauty and the joy and the fulfillment of mothering for women to
(2:40:04) see in opposition to what they mostly see why are they seeing that right now
(2:40:09) seeing the opposite yes what what do you mean because the arm of propaganda is
(2:40:15) left-leaning and progressive that's Sure but but why here why is that the push back why are they seeing messages of you
(2:40:21) can be whatever you want you can go out you can do because of Disney because of Disney why are why are people doing that
(2:40:28) why would people I guess on my who are sympathetic to my view feel it is necessary to tell women hey you can have
(2:40:35) a career you cannot center your life around your children and that's okay it's because before that and I guess you
(2:40:41) want to return to that is a view where it is very you should center your family i'm saying that's inevit I'm saying that
(2:40:48) the return to that is inevitable because you run out of people so yes we're
(2:40:54) running out of people why is it possible Oliver hold on is it possible that
(2:40:59) people like you and the whole bullhorn of academia and Hollywood coming down on
(2:41:04) the women and saying "Go be a boss babe don't be a wife that's so weak."
(2:41:10) Portraying Hold on portray Hold on let me finish no portraying them portraying these women as dumb weak right uh uh
(2:41:18) submissive this is bad right well maybe it's a good thing for women to be submissive you never hear that feminist
(2:41:23) argument wait why is that the case hold on because if women want to be submissive they can why is it missing
(2:41:30) from the feminist machine propaganda machine that being submissive could be femin empowering i don't actually think
(2:41:36) it is it's Oh really yes absolutely i think that from largely from feminism
(2:41:42) what it says is that women should have agency in the choices they make here's a really good example of it and I don't
(2:41:47) know how much we can talk about this because it kind of gets runchy but I think a big um a big part of this is kind of like fetishes and things like
(2:41:54) that and things like people like so for example some women you know like to be degraded in that type of sense in a
(2:41:59) sexual setting we don't view that as anti-feminist because they're making a choice to do something that they enjoy
(2:42:05) which is engage in a type of fantasy however it's entirely still based on
(2:42:11) their consent and based on what they want so in that sense this is exactly
(2:42:16) the point is that feminism uh you're calling it an apparatus that's judged by an ethical paradigm right now you're
(2:42:23) talking about your ethical paradigm about feminism your own ethical paradigm that's judging feminism would would
(2:42:28) allow for basically postumous sex with a cadaavver so long as it was consented what do you mean postumous after death
(2:42:35) like like like if someone consented to their body being used afterwards and there was no harm that would be fair
(2:42:41) game that actually I mean that that kind of is my philosophical worldview i do take a very harm-based approach and it
(2:42:47) does have some counterintuitive implications you know I I think that there are instrumental reasons I've
(2:42:52) actually had a lot of conversations within philosophy just about this in particular there might be instrumental reasons why we don't want to do that but
(2:42:57) I don't think there's something inherently wrong with it great so if your if your worldview that's telling
(2:43:03) the audience why feminism is good includes maybe large amounts of companies renting out cadabvers and that
(2:43:10) being totally fine in the same paradigm uh why would what do you mean like you people renting out dead bodies basically
(2:43:16) you some of some of the worst atrocious behaviors whether it's after you know you a cadaavver stuff or um the rise in
(2:43:24) pornography with young girls basically one out of 10 women from like 25 to 30
(2:43:30) have an Only Fans account because they're told it's empowering dude I I think the reason No hold on i think the
(2:43:36) reason that they're told that it's empowering is because it is it is what it is it's a push back against Is it
(2:43:43) empowering what is it empowering i don't I'm not them i don't know it depends on the woman should we How it depends on
(2:43:48) the woman look Oliver what if you're gonna look Look I'm a new I'm I'm a
(2:43:53) father right you're treating women homogeneous hold on i'm a father here i'm talking to you to a single model
(2:43:58) hold on i'm a man i'm coming to you i'm Hey Oliver i heard your feminist views i
(2:44:04) want some uh want some advice when should I tell my daughters to if it's
(2:44:10) empowering to them when should I tell them about their option of being Only Fans hold on what when did we say that
(2:44:15) it was necessarily empowered i asked you you didn't answer not because it isn't because you can't say should we teach it
(2:44:23) it should be an option for women it When should we teach that as an option you know why you know why I asked
(2:44:29) this hold on Oliver because you just said three minutes ago you said people like me are coming in and saying "You
(2:44:35) can do this you can do this." You're a bunch of snakes on the on the on the tree right in Eden so you're going "You
(2:44:42) can do this you can do this think about this why don't you include pornography if women want to do pornography that's
(2:44:48) fine yeah but why don't you advocate for it i think we should teach it as a legitimate form of you know work
(2:44:54) absolutely cuz cuz cuz my kids my kids Hold on my kids ask me what I do for work they ask uh what does other people
() 
(2:45:01) do for work right at what age you should You should be honest with them like I don't If you're on these shows and for
(2:45:07) example like the Whatever podcast and you're on the show and your kids ask you "Hey what do a lot of these girls do?" What do you tell them no I'm not
(2:45:13) answering that question okay so I mean I in a sense I guess then you're lying or withholding information uh I'll withhold information because I have to protect
(2:45:20) the my my kids right i think so so So the question is when when mommy comes
(2:45:25) home from work right and they have school day right because this is what you're actually advocating for i don't
(2:45:31) think so mommy goes to school with with kid day and they get to talk about what
(2:45:36) they do for work okay you're totally fine with the mother going to school at whatever age let's say it's like fifth
(2:45:42) grade no we're not taking off all her clothes jesus Christ no no no telling the kids what they do in explicit detail
(2:45:49) no well what do you mean why not what do you Because we No why not Oliver what do
(2:45:54) you The girls need to know how they could be liberated no but I'm not saying that's inherently liberatory for women
(2:46:00) it doesn't inherently liberate them but it also doesn't inherently make them not li a No here we go let Let me say this i
(2:46:06) do think that it is a problem of people being pushed into these fields because it's an easy way for them to make a
(2:46:11) dollar and probably a lot of them don't find it fulfilling i would agree with you on that however I would disagree in
(2:46:18) making this generalized statement that none of them find it fulfilling or it being a thing i don't care what they
(2:46:25) think is fulfilling or not the question is you're deciding what's best for them over over them yeah yeah is it possible
(2:46:31) is it possible that it's possible for that they're wrong it is also possible that you are wrong so when it comes to decisions about someone's life I'm going
(2:46:38) to defer to them instead of What about when they're children what i'm not saying that you should let people say
(2:46:44) these things oliver I didn't ask about tell saying it to children you said when you are talking about what other people
(2:46:50) should do with their bodies or not you're going to defer to them i asked about children what does a What do you
(2:46:56) mean about children what does a father do of course you can protect your kids i'm not saying don't protect your children okay but the thing is if being
(2:47:01) a father of your home means um guiding and intervening on the path of your
(2:47:07) child then the best thing about about being a father is is actually the
(2:47:12) intervention part on what they quote want right i'm not going to tell my kid to be a porn star i'm not trying to bite
(2:47:18) that bullet i I didn't ask you that because the the the question is right you are making the claim that when
(2:47:26) it comes to other people and they what they want to do I'm not going to come in and say they shouldn't do it i'm not
(2:47:33) here here's here's how I would view it i am not a woman and I don't I would not view sex work as something that I would
(2:47:39) want to do because of that and because I don't understand it i would not tell my kids to do something that I don't
(2:47:45) understand it and isn't if for example I don't know if for example I don't know I have a family member and they are in
(2:47:51) that industry and we have conversations about that and they tell me and my kids want to learn about that from this
(2:47:57) family member I would I would I would I would want to be present in that conversation so that I can you know okay
(2:48:02) I think what you're saying is not true in this way and we should have a full holistic picture about this but I don't
(2:48:07) think that like we should withhold information from like children in in the
(2:48:13) sense that they should we can teach kids about sex to teach kids about sex and
(2:48:19) and about you know the importance of consent the importance of that we don't have to teach them to be porn
(2:48:25) I didn't even say like I'm I'm asking why in your view why wouldn't you say
(2:48:30) why wouldn't you teach that if you were to say if you were to advocate for a young girl to go into STEM would you do
(2:48:36) that okay why I'm not I'm not I'm not trying to and this is you're not going to pin me into this corner I'm not I'm
(2:48:42) not trying to argue that all forms of work like society are seen as like
(2:48:49) equally liberatory dude it's sim it's so so simple your view of feminism is women
(2:48:54) having the choice to do anything that's quote legal right no no no that's not true why not what do you mean legal
(2:49:00) how's that not empowering from your view wait hold on i think there are some things that are legal that women shouldn't do like what um I think that
(2:49:06) for example that people can have moral obligations so for example I would say that um if my if if a woman in my life
(2:49:12) had a family member who had a very serious condition and they needed a blood transfusion in order to survive
(2:49:17) and the woman in my life was uniquely qualified because of blood type or something like that I would probably tell her you should you should you
(2:49:23) should help them out you should do that you should you know help them out in that way it wouldn't be legally it wouldn't be legally they could should
(2:49:29) not be legally obligated to do that but I think morally they would have a should they shouldn't do that no no no what
() 
(2:49:35) about give me an example of a should something women shouldn't do or I but I I would apply it to men and women so I'm
(2:49:40) not making like the women shouldn't do this like because they're women it's women shouldn't do this because they're people and people in general should not
(2:49:47) do this so for example I don't think doing hard drugs is a good thing i don't think doing heroin is probably a good
(2:49:52) thing for most people um so I would I would advise women and men to not do that that doesn't therefore follow from
(2:49:58) it that I think it should be illegal for a lot of other instrumental consequences that I think would follow from laws of
(2:50:04) that nature i think it would make the problem worse so yeah there's an example wait is that the same reasoning you you
(2:50:10) were against you were against making post death cadaavver sex illegal because
(2:50:16) there's some other things that might make it worse like I mean so this is this and it's it's really hard to have
(2:50:23) like like like metaphilosophical conversations on these types of podcasts because what's going to happen is if I
(2:50:29) try to defend my philosophical view on its merits you're going to blow it out of proportion and be like he supports
(2:50:35) people [ __ ] dead people and it's just like no I don't say support i'm saying
(2:50:40) allow I don't I didn't say it i just asked you under your view if it's based on harm
(2:50:47) principle I don't think people should do it and and here and the reason I would you make it illegal though what i think it I probably would be illegal and the
(2:50:54) reason for that and the reason for that is because I think there is a very very very high likelihood of instrumental harm um for example I don't think people
(2:51:01) want their dead loved ones to be That's true but unless they made a lot of money
(2:51:07) and and then the harm was countered in their view because if they're alive well yeah if the family got together and said
(2:51:14) "Hey grandma's coming over you know she's on her way out and she wants to talk to us and she says "I want to I'm
(2:51:21) going to do this for the family." Uh basically give her body out after death
(2:51:26) for a week to for anyone to rent it out or whatever and the family goes "Cool we'll be rich." Like Hakua
(2:51:32) it's kind of weird i'm weird isn't isn't really a counter to whether it's consistent with your ethical paradigm
(2:51:38) yeah and and here's the thing is I don't use weirdness as a criterion for what I think should be prohibited like I don't
(2:51:44) I don't I don't know there's a lot of cases of what is called moral dumbfounding where we think something is
(2:51:49) wrong but we can't point to a specific reason as to why it's wrong so yeah this
(2:51:54) this is this is weird i don't I don't know i'd be like okay let's put it another way do you think under your
(2:52:00) ethical framework people can act against themselves and it be morally wrong doesn't harm anyone else just just
(2:52:09) all self-contained i I would say yes but it's because what they do I don't I
(2:52:16) don't believe it is like like possible to live in a universe where what you do like self-regarding actions i think
(2:52:21) everything you do has an effect it's like doing drugs okay oh should you be able to do these hard drugs it's like well probably maybe you shouldn't
(2:52:27) because it will still have these effects well that's that's why I asked about the the what I call an epidemic of young
(2:52:35) girls and by the way men are still part of this uh the consumption element of it
(2:52:40) but girls think these young girls are being basically trained through feminism first right this is this is the result
(2:52:46) these are the fruits of feminism teaches feminism early on uh you're going to have a radical change you're going to
(2:52:52) have the the sexual revolution you're going to have the drug revolution and then you're going to part ways with the
(2:52:59) traditional lifestyle of Christian values and ethics in the home then what happens is you get this mass amount of
() 
(2:53:06) technology you know to express yourself you run you run head first hold on fair
(2:53:12) enough head first into it and now they think because of all of the the the
(2:53:17) propaganda the pop stars they're all they're all disgusting right and so now
(2:53:22) the little kids the the poor little girls go "Well that's how I have to be now." Right think no and that's all
(2:53:28) feminism dude that's not traditionalism that's feminism and I think you're doing a very good job at portraying feminism
(2:53:36) in its worst possible light thank you where's the good Where's the good one hold on the good one is encouraging
(2:53:42) women to be doctors the good one is encouraging women to go into those careers why would that be a Why is that
(2:53:48) better than pornography from your view why is that better than pornography i don't know so So what why are we
(2:53:53) listening to then well no because look if a woman wants I don't here's the thing and here's the reason maybe why
(2:54:01) I'm able to say why I think it would be good for a woman to become a doctor but maybe not to do Only Fans it's because I
(2:54:08) can I can conceptualize of the good of me being a doctor i really can't conceptualize the good of me being on
(2:54:15) Only Fans okay but I don't know i I I would I would have to talk with certain
(2:54:20) individual like certain individuals who were involved in this industry like I just I don't know i don't want to make these blanket statements that we have to
(2:54:27) choose between women being in the home or being sex workers i think there is a dichotomy i think there's so much great
(2:54:33) ideas i'm not presenting a dichotomy i'm doing it no it's not if we accept feminism we have to accept that every
(2:54:39) single woman whenever they you know it doesn't actually it it's not actually reduce you
(2:54:44) to absurdity though you're actually consistent that you would say "Yeah uh teaching young girls that that's an
(2:54:51) option to get into pornography would be empowering and in line with feminism." I think you you could teach them that it
(2:54:57) is something that people do but be honest about it and I'm not I'm not a fan of the porn industry i agree it's
(2:55:04) incredibly exploitative and I agree that it has a lot of problems but so like I don't I think there there is a reasons
(2:55:10) to be instrumentally against the porn industry and how it targets and exploits young girls but I don't think that that
(2:55:17) that we should like pretend for like people that it doesn't exist yeah but is don't you ever think about uh internally
(2:55:25) i know you said you can't really put pinpoint what it is about it but why is it that even you yourself who's
(2:55:31) advocating for just like sort of like liberated woman um you still advocate
(2:55:37) for more wholesome uh useful because that's what I'm
(2:55:43) familiar with dude i'm arguing only from my worldview and perspective and the reality is is there's a lot of things
(2:55:49) that I see sorry yeah sorry there's a lot of things that I see and that I don't understand that yeah my first
(2:55:56) response is I don't get that that's weird and my initial response to it is it's weird i don't understand it i don't
(2:56:02) like it therefore it shouldn't be something that we allow and I think that's a bad basis for basing a moral
(2:56:10) framework i think disgust is a very poor metric of determining what is good and what is bad it might be uh not
(2:56:17) sufficient but I don't think it's entirely in invalid i don't think it's entirely invalid i agree with you but
(2:56:22) like I don't know like one could uh like for example I don't know like let's say some one person thinks seeing like
(2:56:28) people who are overweight having sex is disgusting they'd never want to see that that just I don't want that's not
(2:56:34) evidence whatsoever at all that there's anything wrong with people who are overweight having sex like whatsoever
(2:56:40) like it's not it's not like what like you I don't know about that i I would I might argue that um that being
(2:56:48) overweight or like super obese might be an ethical issue if you hold a view that
(2:56:54) uh your own body is uh let's say like like an icon of God or an expression and
(2:56:59) people and people should should take care of themselves would you agree that also there are certain at least conditions and body types that it just
() 
(2:57:05) some some people are are just bigger you know what I mean no matter how much I agree no matter how much diet they just
(2:57:11) they shouldn't be allowed to have sex are you are you I'm just kidding well I mean it's if you're going to say that
(2:57:17) women shouldn't have the right to vote and then you say like fat people shouldn't have sex it's not too far off from what you women voting is way more
(2:57:24) harmful to society what the things they vote for is this is how men and men this is how I know this is how I know that
(2:57:31) there's a specific difference is that again you're going to be able to find exceptions okay you're going to have to
(2:57:37) just use some charity here what women vote for since like I don't know the 50s
(2:57:43) since onward right they vote according to their sort of nurturing traits and
(2:57:49) what they do is they turn the this is the irony hold on this is the irony of specific examples I I will They they
(2:57:55) expand this is the irony you're arguing against this authoritative power right the the man coming down right on freedom
(2:58:02) and liberty for women women vote in with patterns that expand authoritarian
(2:58:08) government and uh basically examples you you very big generality gun gun gun gun
(2:58:15) laws they vote in protection they they vote for let's say generally safety over
(2:58:20) liberty they they vote safety over liberty uh gun laws is a perfect example okay um a lot of them vote uh
(2:58:27) pro-abortion okay right what What is that well that's that's What do you mean that's against them how is that against
(2:58:34) them they're they're annihilating their own kids what do you mean how is that against you i don't think that people
(2:58:39) should be pregnant against their will what do you mean they had sex what are you talking about i mean first off there's a big jump to say that just
(2:58:45) because someone consented to sex they consented to pregnancy it doesn't No it does follow no it How How does it follow
(2:58:50) that follows the same way getting into a car you consented to possibly get into an accident okay and if you possibly get into an accident does it therefore mean
(2:58:57) that you should have to use your body to sustain the life of the person that you got into an accident with by law what do
(2:59:02) you mean you're saying it's not a person i'm not No I'm not saying that actually no you can't no no no you can you can
(2:59:08) make a bodily rights argument for abortion that doesn't deny fetal personhood it's something that Judith Jarvis
(2:59:13) Thompson in her paper she can't tell me what a person No who cares about Judith she doesn't even know what a person is what do you What do you mean by that how
(2:59:20) she she grants to you whatever your view of a person is she says we don't even need to discuss that in the abortion debate we can have a conversation
(2:59:26) directly surrounding bodily rights really so why does the doctor uh save the the non-person then what do you mean
(2:59:33) the doctor save the non the surgeon the woman gets in an accident right and a feminist says "Well I'm not denying it's
(2:59:39) a person." No but why is the doctor obligated to save the non the person well what do you mean if it's not a
(2:59:45) person i I'm not saying it's not a person you're ascribing to me this view oh oh I see do you know you so see the
(2:59:52) person who's about to abort their baby doesn't see it as a person but you do so some people some people don't and some
(2:59:57) people they're they're very different they're meant a lot to decide on the spot there are a lot of aspects of the abortion debate one of them So so so
(3:00:04) it's like this dude there's there's two women who are pregnant right same same level of pregnancy they both get into an
(3:00:10) accident and the doctor doesn't determine it doesn't determine it's not dependent it's not dependent on what they think it's not dependent on what
(3:00:16) they think it's not dependent on what they think personhood is not a doctor the surgeon saves both of them right i
(3:00:23) mean ideally sure they should yeah what if they decide not to what do you mean what if they determine that like that's
(3:00:28) not a baby so this is basically the argument of why is uh abortion a double homicide if it's not a person type thing
(3:00:34) or I mean that could be used so think about it this way if we're talking about this idea of like rendering life-saving care if for example you agree to allow
(3:00:40) someone the use of your kidneys for a period of time and you you're willing to save their life let's say you're generously you're like "Oh you know what
(3:00:47) this is either a family member or something like that i'm gonna generously allow this person to do that and a gunman comes in and kills both of you
(3:00:53) they've still done something wrong but if you were to say I don't consent to my body being used in this way it's very
(3:00:58) painful i don't want to do that anymore and you quote unquote unplug from them or something or no longer you cease the
(3:01:04) consent you haven't you haven't murdered them yeah but you're you're including there's another body sure but just I'm
(3:01:11) not denying that there's another contradiction i'm not denying that there's another body i'm denying that other bodies have a right to use your
(3:01:17) body without your consent that's what I'm saying the look if abortion is
(3:01:23) getting rid of the other body and your argument is you can't violate this woman
(3:01:28) using her body right like the way she wants to use your body sure you can't use the body autonomy and leave out the
(3:01:36) other body wait you aren't you're agreeing that there's two bodies it's the same reason you can't be forced to donate your kidney against your will
(3:01:42) even if you get into an accident that requires someone the use of your kidney you're not denying that two bodies exist
(3:01:48) you're saying that one body doesn't have a right to the other body there's no rights
(3:01:56) okay i don't know i don't know why you keep appealing to these things i'm appealing to societal intuitions that we largely hold if you want to reject
(3:02:02) everything that we base like society on and go off on your own tangent then I I don't know how to engage in this conversation well I'm saying like you're
(3:02:08) assuming there's these you're because you're using metaphysical terms societal norms but do you agree generally people
(3:02:15) if those change under your do you agree that generally people should not be forced against their will to donate an
(3:02:21) organ it depends on the situation oh my god fine well you were talking about generalities right you're talking
(3:02:27) constantly about generalities generally speaking should it be wrong for someone to have an organ taken from them or used
(3:02:33) without their consent yes or no generally yeah okay cool so that's a principle under which I'm operating on
(3:02:39) so once we get that principle out of the way and we can say but a baby's not an organ dude the baby's not the organ in
(3:02:45) question the uterus is the organ in question and the baby they're not getting rid of the uterus no they're
(3:02:50) using the uterus you're renting you're evicting them i mean I guess so you invited So you
(3:02:56) invited a person in to your home and then you're like I just I want to I just want to eat the person exactly i'm just
(3:03:03) going to kill the person who I invited into my home by opening my legs no first of all it's not actually I I think there
(3:03:08) are and this might get there really interesting literature on this specifically i think an analogous
(3:03:13) scenario to pregnancy and of course you're probably going to reject this is imagine that you are having lunch with
(3:03:19) someone um and and you're eating and they start choking and you give them the himlick maneuver and save their life and
(3:03:24) in the process you rupture you know their their kidney you puncture their lungs something like that and then they
(3:03:30) require your body to continue living in that scenario do you think that you have some sort of like you should be legally
(3:03:36) required to use your body in that scenario I wouldn't be opposed to Right really
(3:03:43) okay i mean I I just I I I would not share that thing whatsoever because you generously tried to save their life well
(3:03:49) the thing is it would be to me it would be awesome to live in a society where someone would be so willing to do that
(3:03:57) i mean one could argue it would be super derogatory but that's but that's for saving a life that's what's so so dis
(3:04:03) different about this view is that we're talking about saving lives and what you would do or what's required which is a totally different um system of thinking
(3:04:11) than whether or not women like for instance let's just let's forget let's shift to just this this question because
(3:04:18) to bring it back to feminism how is women being able to destroy the baby
(3:04:25) that's growing inside of them how is that how is that good oh there's water
(3:04:31) down here i didn't see it sorry over there over here sorry about that sorry would you mind repeating how is it good
(3:04:37) for women to yeet their offspring because I think women should have a
(3:04:42) choice when and where they and what situations they get pregnant i don't think people should be pregnant again i
(3:04:47) don't think people should be pregnant again would you guys mind taking a brief uh pause here yeah that's fine i want to do a uh we can come right back to it
(3:04:54) though if you want to just uh make a note on that i want to read a couple chats here uh we have just by the way

(3:06:10) rate your dad who what the [ __ ] who produced such a weak offspring on that scale also can you explain why a woman
(3:06:16) would choose to get impregnated by him to produce useless garbage in Wow okay do you want to brutal i mean you know I
(3:06:24) mean I think it's kind of pathetic he wasted $100 to to kind of send that in so I mean good for you emotional damage

(3:06:57) i should probably remove that sorry i thought he was going to do it no is there a There's not a number is there
(3:07:03) any circumstance in which you would If someone was going to die if I didn't wear a MAGA hat sure sorry if someone
(3:07:10) were to die if I wouldn't wear a mag I don't know i'm not going to wear a MAGA hat it doesn't is antithetical to almost everything that I stand for like I'm not
(3:07:16) No I don't know what about for a million dollars i don't I mean sure we can make these like comparative claims that like
(3:07:22) like would the good of me getting a million dollars and then donating that money to a cause that I'm in favor of offset the harm of wearing a MAGA hat
(3:07:29) maybe but like I'm not going to wear a MAGA hat because you get money donated to your show like sorry that's not
(3:07:35) that's not how that's going to work i got to remove the goal he I thought he would go for it nope i thought he would be a sport but um okay we also have

(3:08:29) discord.gg whatever we got merch shop.whatever.com tts has been lowered
(3:08:36) $69ts um do you guys want to switch the prompt or
(3:08:41) um I mean I don't really know what there really would beat it well one of the ones I had proposed was uh and I sort of
(3:08:47) switched it a little bit uh are what was it are men more privileged i don't I
(3:08:53) don't really think that like or are I feel like Jim Bob would just like agree that they are and they should be right so this isn't there really wouldn't be
(3:08:58) much Okay dis well I mean wouldn't that be Jim Bob would say it was good I imagine and you would say it was bad but
() 
(3:09:04) that just goes back to the whole conversation we were literally having sorry yeah and that that would just go back to the whole conversation we were
(3:09:09) already having so I don't think this is a separate question yeah it would probably come back i mean I would say men are privileged for good reason um
(3:09:16) because force is privilege and then um if you said women are not privileged it
(3:09:21) probably be because descriptively men are privileged and to correct it what do
(3:09:27) you do how do you correct the privilege problem how do you correct the privilege
(3:09:32) problem i mean it it largely would end up you're you're not denying that certain people are stronger than others
(3:09:37) i just think that if you are stronger if you have certain privileges if you are endowed with certain traits that are of
(3:09:44) no fault to your own I think you do bear some sort of responsibility to help others out and not use that power to
(3:09:52) hurt others and use that power to advance their interests and not Well
(3:09:58) well well well hold on i was up I was with you to a point yeah the interest but then you're like well not really
(3:10:04) like like if it's an interest to for women to to yeet their potential children I don't think they've earned
(3:10:10) the right of men collectively to protect their rights at all i think we should I think I think we should come down harder
(3:10:17) on women for yeing their children because they're in a state of luxury like they're they're in a state of
(3:10:23) absolute decadence right now what do you mean i mean that the privileges they're provided wholly dependent on men
(3:10:30) allowing them to to be like this you're you're arguing well men being that you have force you should really be nicer to
(3:10:36) these women who are horrific well hold on i mean if you want to go back to the abortion discussion you are begging the
(3:10:43) question which is you are assuming the thing you are trying to prove which is that women getting abortions is is is a
(3:10:49) is a bad thing it's something that we should legally prevent i think if if it's the case continue that conversation
(3:10:54) well if it's the case that we need human beings it's and we both agree it's a
(3:11:00) good thing to fix the problem of having human beings in society then that doesn't mean anything that mean doesn't
(3:11:06) mean anything to fix that problem how does it how does it follow that eating 1 million kids per year is a good thing um
(3:11:12) I think it I will go back to this argument i don't think that anyone should be obligated by law to use their
(3:11:18) body to sustain another person or what did I ask you i don't know ask me again
(3:11:25) you asked me many things i don't You ask me ridiculous question i didn't ask what you think it justifies that they eat
(3:11:30) their kids i asked you what is good about it what is good about it it's good
(3:11:37) that people are not pregnant against their will that's what's good about it people should not be forced to gestate a
(3:11:44) fetus why should they be forced to to uh breastfeed their child at at one week no
(3:11:49) they they shouldn't be forced to breastfeed if if they don't want to take care if they don't want to take care if they don't want to take care of their kid then they can give that child up for
(3:11:55) No no no hold on a second hold on a second if someone is not obligated to do
(3:12:01) anything and not hold on take care of a child yes hold on a second they had a
(3:12:06) child it's the first week it's like cabin in the woods like the child can survive by No the mother has no
(3:12:12) obligation you heard it here mother has no obligation to breastfeed her child that she brought into the world
(3:12:19) according to Oliver but he skipped to an alternative that he likes which is to give it up to for adoption she has no
(3:12:26) obligation to do that either that takes more resources for her as well what do you mean i'm not saying that you don't have an obligation to ensure that a
(3:12:32) child in your care does not die it does not mean that you Yeah but why is why why is that an obligation if your whole
(3:12:39) entire ethical view is no one is owed your labor no no no that's not what I said no one has owed your body no no no
(3:12:45) those are two different things right would you say that there's a difference between people paying taxes and being
(3:12:51) required to pay taxes and being required to donate their bodily tissue to the government would you say there's a
(3:12:56) meaningful distinction there that at least most people would you know it's at least defensible it makes sense you can
(3:13:02) tax your money but you can't really request that I donate a pint of blood that's kind of a little bit too far um I
(3:13:08) mean I could grant that they're different scales but they could they could be closer together than you'd think i I and and and yeah one could one
(3:13:15) could make the argument that you know your money your your money is an extension of your labor i get that but but I want to point out something before
(3:13:21) we move on with this hypothetical is that for my view taxation as it originally existed was an obligation and
(3:13:28) a duty it wasn't based on some sort of rights or or anything like this it was there was a social contract there was a
(3:13:34) social component that rich people they actually wanted it was it was like a an elite status to be able to help others
(3:13:42) what happened to that well what happened uh people started entering the workforce and and people made more money and then
(3:13:49) it got uh weaken the middle class people got rich and then decided they actually didn't want to keep being altruistic
(3:13:55) well no no it wasn't just that it was that as pe more people got rich because there were less rich people right
(3:14:00) there's there's more rich rich people now than there was before it was that rich people were were less um available
(3:14:08) and so there was like this essence of like well we're rich this is what we do we take care of the little people right
(3:14:14) this is great I'm sorry I was not paying attention I'm just this is great I just think it's really funny that that he's spending $100 to insult I'm I'm I'm
(3:14:21) impressed that he thinks that I'm worth $100 to tell me that I mean I think it's a compliment almost I mean he thinks
(3:14:28) apparently it's his his opinion is so valuable that he wants to spend $100 to do that Okay hey you know keep keep them
(3:14:35) going you know what here's what we're going to do we're going to actually lower the TTS we're going to do a $30 we're going to just do a roast session
(3:14:41) to wrap up the show uh I'll let I wanted to maybe do a little rapid fire segment here at the end just some of your like
(3:14:48) prompts on TikTok if you're fine with that we won't like linger for too long but No go you guys see this vibration
() 
(3:14:54) that's crazy okay uh we do have emotional damage i'll pull it up does this guy realize that he's going to be
(3:14:59) the kind of man who gets affected the most by what he's advocating for he will
(3:15:05) realize it when his blue-haired husband makes him a stay-at-home mom breastfeeding his kid who questions i do
(3:15:12) think men can I think men can breastfeed because they have nipples
(3:15:19) right so if you have nipples you produce milk right that's how it goes now yeah
(3:15:24) you just produce I think I I don't know look I don't know enough about the like the science of it but I at least to my
(3:15:30) understanding like if you induce certain types of hormones or if you give men certain hormones they will they will lactate it's probably not a no natural
(3:15:38) like no hormones i don't think so because I mean the reason that women lactate when they give birth is that there is a certain hormone that's
(3:15:44) released that you know indicates that I I'm forgetting exactly what it's called I think or I don't know something is it
(3:15:49) prolactin yeah I think those men who try to force breastfeed their child pretending they're a woman are just
(3:15:55) giving their child some sort of puss isn't it i mean I think that's kind of weird i don't I don't I don't know i
(3:16:00) don't What I don't like to do in that situation is kind of like paint a whole demographic or group based on the
(3:16:06) actions of some select few so I don't I don't know i think there are I think there are perfectly fine individuals who
(3:16:12) don't identify within the gender binary i'm not going to claim to have some ultimate epistemic knowledge on what it
(3:16:18) is to be either of those things but I don't want to demonize those groups of people just because some people are
(3:16:24) doing something yeah I don't think that men should be putting their nipples in their kids' mouths that's weird don't do that but I don't think it follows from
(3:16:31) that that all automatically men who are uh you know choosing to express their gender differently or is deciding to not
(3:16:38) identify as men are somehow like equivalent in that group i don't want to I don't want to you know I don't I don't
(3:16:43) think it's fair to paint people like that we should not judge the the individuals like a monolith so well I
(3:16:49) mean go ahead Brian oh okay yeah yeah yeah uh excuse me guys i'm a bit sick so good
(3:16:57) uh oh okay you're you're there was maybe like three or four that I thought were interesting that could perhaps prompt
(3:17:03) some conversation why women choose the bear so this isn't the man versus bear thing yeah do you guys want to have a
(3:17:09) quick little 5 10 minutes actually I switched my position on this the impulse
() 
(3:17:14) from the pro-male side is to say "You're crazy men can protect you and bears are
(3:17:20) ferocious and they'll kill you." I kind of thought about swapping and just being like "Yeah men are dangerous." That's my
(3:17:25) point i mean I'm horrified by your conclusion but I guess I admire your consistency
(3:17:31) but it's true like like maybe it's the right thing to say "Yeah women you should be afraid of men cuz you don't
(3:17:37) know what they're going to do." That's why you should rely on and hope to rely on good men who can actually defend you
(3:17:42) from the bad men because you know you can't from the man or the bear sure and I guess my whole thing with that is I
(3:17:49) still do not see how any of that is contrary to a feminist worldview well a feminist worldview is simply this right
(3:17:56) you have you want to get rid of the power of men feminism is a movement away from men in power i think it's a way of
(3:18:02) movement away from men in power somewhat at the expense of women and their autonomy i think there has to be some
(3:18:08) element if men are in power and only doing like and are being egalitarian in
(3:18:13) the way that they govern alongside women that's not like I don't think something that feminists would be against it's not
(3:18:20) that men have power it's the way that they wield that power that is the problem men can't look it's a
(3:18:26) performative contradiction for men to be solely in power and wield their power to
(3:18:33) produce some sort of Sims simulation of egalitarianism what are you What are you talking about it's literally not
(3:18:39) egalitarianism what do you There can be I don't know what you're talking about there can be egalitarian outcomes that
(3:18:44) still give people as much autonomy and ability as possible like I don't you think because men hold this power that
(3:18:51) therefore they will always inherently like I don't know dominate it's not what they will do it's the fact that the
(3:18:57) necessary component to your egalitarian vision is something that's not
() 
(3:19:02) egalitarian it's a literally a necessary component of it it's like it's like the thing you that you are arguing against
(3:19:10) is literally you utilized to produce a fiction of the thing you think you have against men holding power so then it's
(3:19:17) not egalitarianism if egalitarianism or feminism requires an arm that's uh that
(3:19:23) is the manifestation of the disparity between men and women then it's not egalitarian it's not arguing that we
(3:19:28) should have an egalitarian structure of society where men and women are represented equally in every field
(3:19:35) participate equally in every single realm it's that especially in the fields
(3:19:40) where there really aren't relevant differences i will 100% concede that women can't probably and probably most
(3:19:47) men actually can't meet the standards that it takes to be a Navy Seal so it makes sense that Navy Seals should be
(3:19:52) men that doesn't apply to being a scientist that doesn't apply so because
(3:19:57) of that we should not exclude women from STEM field you because you would rather
(3:20:03) have a woman you would tell a woman that her she she you would be more happy being in a home with children than being
(3:20:09) a science that's not excluding her problem no that's not excluding her that's just telling her and guiding her what what she should do even and we've
(3:20:16) already agreed that even the smartest who end up in the STEM we would want them multiply because they're smart we
(3:20:22) want smart women and I don't think that those two things are mutually you have to choose at some point of having a career and having children of course I
(3:20:29) don't think No I I don't I I I don't think that's the case no really so you think it's better for children to be
(3:20:34) raised by strangers in the public school system that's um I think that in a certain sense I do think public
(3:20:39) education is a good is a good thing oh my gosh are you kidding me i I think Come on it's not Wait wait a second no
(3:20:46) no wait i dump a beer on my head after that one no I don't think Did you just say the public education system is a
(3:20:51) good simple Oh my god i agree that there are problems with it and I agree that there are many issues with it however
(3:20:57) the alternative which is parents educating their children in their own worldview necessarily with there being
(3:21:04) no counterbalance to it will lead to people with entiring differing ideologies that never converge i think
(3:21:11) people should encounter ideas that differ from what they've been taught i think people should I think school
(3:21:17) should provide do you think pluralism is better than like homogyny and and and
(3:21:23) like cohesive inroup thinking yes but I don't I don't think that
(3:21:28) they're mutually excl you know what I mean i don't think that like I think you can have a I think it requires some of both you can't have where the whole idea
(3:21:33) of you can't be so open-minded your mind falls out but I do think that you should be open-minded enough that you're not
(3:21:38) dogmatic in your conclusions that's very dogmatic okay fine right if if you're going to
(3:21:45) argue that Yeah then like if if I claim that it's like an o anti-d dogmatic dogma i'm
(3:21:52) I'm arguing Oliver that dogma is not always bad like what if there's good
(3:21:57) dogma so well I think there's a really interesting argument that John Stewart Mill makes in his thing called um on
(3:22:02) liberty and the reason that truth ought to be challenged even if we know it's true is because it risks becoming dead
(3:22:09) dogma that we don't know why it's true things that are true you know retain their value by remaining true in the
(3:22:15) face of objections because they're challenged and they remain true and they test like traditional families are good
(3:22:21) for society and women going into porn instead of having children is just not good i don't think that I think that's
(3:22:28) going to be Oliver i think you're going to come back in due time and you're going to go you know that that Jim that
(3:22:34) wacky Jim Bob guy with the gay shirt he was right and he he actually uh his
(3:22:40) statements align with John Steuart Mill's view that the truth actually prevails but that's not I'm not saying
(3:22:47) but you you were saying dogma is good dogma No I said dogma could be good dogma could be good i don't think so
(3:22:53) because I don't think that uncritically accepting things is is is really so so
(3:22:58) crit not critically accepting women's rights sure yeah i'm not saying I don't
(3:23:04) think you should be Yeah i don't think you should be dogmatic about anything if someone says you know I Yeah like I don't I don't I'm not selling people
(3:23:10) that like if a woman says like I have a right to an abortion you should just like if you don't know what it is then yeah research it what about What about
(3:23:16) Are you dogmatic do you think it's a good thing to be dogmatic that rights exist just generally I don't think you
(3:23:22) can because I agree with you that rights fundamentally don't exist don't exist what exists if that what is what is it we're
(3:23:29) calling a right that actually does exist that's not a right like like when we say you and I agree rights don't actually
() 
(3:23:36) exist there's some sort of construct what's the only thing we're really pointing to that does exist
(3:23:42) i don't know i think I I mean sorry i think like I think pain and pleasure suffering humans have the capacity to
(3:23:49) suffer that is something entities have the capacity to suffer it is bad when an entity you know I'm gonna suffer well
(3:23:55) it's it's linked to that i'm going to say force okay why why why do people I
(3:24:01) mean I think we can bottom out why do people exercise force um well uh they have a worldview that
(3:24:08) informs whether they should exercise force or not they have a sense that it was justified it's a type of justified
(3:24:15) true belief in a lot of senses um but um ultimately on the wide on the grand
(3:24:20) scale of things when we're talking about a society people execute force because it's either counter to force or it's the
(3:24:27) maintaining of an order which with the threat of force and I consider those things uh se two sides of the same hand
(3:24:33) the threat of force is the use of force i mean I can keep going why do we care about order well if you want a feminist
(3:24:39) society I'm just asking you I'm I'm trying to build order what what I'm basically trying to build it down to is like it kind of just comes down to a
(3:24:45) combination of like pain like like just suffering like if a society is not ordered you know people would be suffering people would die things would
(3:24:52) not be optimal it would be suboptimal because of you know there would be a lot of suffering if there's disorder no I
(3:24:59) mean that's not that might be true in some sense but you can have a fair amount of order and there's still
(3:25:04) suffering you can have ordered suffering true and I think there's ordered suffering the it the fact whether it's
(3:25:09) ordered or disordered doesn't make it good or bad is whether there's suffering that makes it good or bad go ahead i do have to move it on uh did you want to
(3:25:16) give your position though on the what's your position on the man versus bear i mean I I I think my position and I I've
() 
(3:25:22) stated this a bit in the Jubilee video that I was in and I think it is the case is um I think that the point of the
(3:25:29) comparison that was made and my understanding of it was it was originally a man who actually like brought it up as an example um and it
(3:25:36) and it it seems to be pretty ubiquitous that men and women alike especially with men if you frame it like with their
(3:25:42) daughters you know would you rather have your daughter encounter a random man or a random bear in the woods men almost
(3:25:48) universally choose choose bear so I think that men who kind of get offended by it it's like I mean if you're not
(3:25:54) part of the problem then why are you why are you offended you know you shouldn't be offended that women don't want like bad men so I I don't know i I think we
(3:26:01) should defer to women i also think it's true and this is something that I really hadn't considered that for I mean certain women they would consider things
(3:26:07) to be there are things that are worse than death you know like being like you know assaulted and and and tortured and
(3:26:13) you know whatever you know a man could do is just worse than being mowled by a bear and dying so I think in that sense
(3:26:19) it it could be just I just want to be killed painless oliver this is what I ask instead of that I I just move it
(3:26:25) forward i say you encounter a man in the woods and uh you have a sense that
(3:26:31) they're that they're um not they don't have good intentions right
(3:26:36) do you ask for another man and risk that it might be another bad man or a good
(3:26:42) man right or a bear what do you mean so like like it's man and bear except
(3:26:47) you're already in the instance of a of a man so you I don't know i mean I think women would probably just do their very
(3:26:53) best to get out of that situation i also reduced it to a uh an elevator and how
(3:26:58) that changes things a little bit in an elevator because there's a ton I'm staying at a hotel and uh twice now I
(3:27:05) was in the elevator with a woman yeah like alone and so um this I think it's a little different though because Well but
(3:27:11) that's what's that's what I'm pointing to is like what makes the Yeah but what makes it different i'll different it might not be different let's assume that
(3:27:17) it's an elevator that you can't get out of i think it's very different than like most elevators you know you get in the
(3:27:23) elevator you click a floor and the door's going to open like you know what I mean like a woods is like a isolated
(3:27:28) place you know anything can happen there's no supervisors or people around and an elevator Are you saying an
(3:27:33) elevator is worse to be isolated with a man than a than a woods no because I'm saying fine if we if we stipulate that
(3:27:39) maybe it's a broken elevator or it's an elevator that can like be prevented from being opened i still think the man it's
(3:27:46) like you'd be able you might be able to get a couple shots in with a man in an elevator and if you're in a room with a
(3:27:52) bear it's pretty much over i'm not so I look and I I think I I I think getting into these a lot of these specifics kind
(3:27:59) of like misses the whole point of it but I do think that it is also important to note that like a lot of wildlife too
(3:28:04) it's like usually if you leave it alone it's going to leave you alone depending on the bear you know there's like grizzly bears or something like that
(3:28:10) that are more provocative bears of color uh commit more attacks okay it's just true yeah good job no it's literally
(3:28:17) true yeah yeah but you're making a thinly veiled rhetorical point what do you know yeah okay you're really smart
(3:28:22) yep mhm there you go okay all right we have a super chat here
(3:28:28) from emotional damage he says "Brian can you give him this $100 $100 to this guy
(3:28:34) to get a shot of testosterone?" Yeah you can i bet his views will change if we balance the estrogen content produced by
(3:28:40) his ovaries on second thought don't give it to him screw this kind of indecisive i mean not being decisive i don't you
(3:28:47) think decisiveness is something that kind of is like important to manliness seem to be kind of indecisive i don't know how masculine you really are okay
(3:28:54) emotional damage are you gonna let him Are you gonna let Oliver talk to you like that emotional damage uh thank you
(3:29:01) for that emotional damage appreciate your super chat guys we're doing a roast session can I comment on one of these yeah sure because I think the 499 was
(3:29:08) really interesting it's like I'm wondering like when people like kind of call like men who they like view who
(3:29:13) disagree with them as like not real men i think it kind of enforces this idea that like there is a very gendered
(3:29:18) aspect to manhood you know what I mean man isn't only used in the biological sense like it very often is used to you
(3:29:24) know substitute the stereotypes that people often associate with male and female so stereotypes are very useful
(3:29:30) though okay yeah that's true but there is there there definitely is such a
(3:29:35) thing as gender and it exists socially and like you know what I mean like you can't like if that wasn't the case then
(3:29:42) no one would use man or woman as an insult because it wouldn't have any social connotation if which it does so
(3:29:47) thank you for acknowledging that there is a social component of gender that isn't just purely biological going to let uh we got some roasts coming in here
(3:29:54) we go thank you Sons of Liberty sons of Liberty donated
() 
(3:30:00) $29.99 will there ever be a time when we realize what these leftists advocate for is evil like evil this isn't to debate
(3:30:08) and agree to disagree and live happily ever after with them they are evil jim Bob
(3:30:14) uh yeah well evil i don't call people aren't evil people can be wicked if they
(3:30:20) know what evil is and they continue but I don't think Oliver here um holds a
(3:30:25) theological view or a Christian view so he's operating from what he's got but um
(3:30:31) yes I believe feminism ultimately comes from a denial of truth and I believe
(3:30:36) that a denial of truth ultimately is evil yeah all right i think denial of feminism comes down of the humanity $210
(3:30:45) i'll have you come did you get new mics sounds different no also does this guy
(3:30:50) not realize that mainstream equality has literally morphed into equity even his
(3:30:55) definition of feminism is wrong from the majority opinion so I mean that that actually is an interesting point that I
(3:31:00) do want to get into i'm not really defending the like prevailing view of like I don't know there's there there's
(3:31:07) this idea that like all outcomes have to be equal there's this kind of idea within critical thought that like all
(3:31:13) disparities are a result of some underlying like systemic issue and I actually don't subscribe to that i think
(3:31:18) there can be benign disparities i think differences between groups don't always call out for the evil of the system um
(3:31:24) there can't just be differences um and so I would I don't always agree that like equity and as it's like advocated
(3:31:32) for is the best thing we shouldn't always strive for equal outcomes we should subscribe for people to have
(3:31:37) access to opportunities and not be you know denied things arbitrarily how is an
(3:31:42) access to opportunity not an outcome because you might not necessarily do the
(3:31:47) same thing with that opportunity i agree they're they're very much linked because the opportunities that you have depends
(3:31:52) on the like outcome of your family or something like that yeah like if you look at a scenario and you summarize it
(3:31:59) and you say look there's equal opportunity if you wanted to produce equal opportunity the equal opportunity
(3:32:05) on the table is now the new outcome you produced so I feel like that you know I a lot of that came from like I don't
(3:32:11) even know 10 years years ago rhetoric from the right you'd get Ben Shapiro be like I'm I'm not for equal outcome and
(3:32:17) me for half and you'd be ranting that around but I realized that in a different debate that you actually can't
(3:32:24) separate those two you're always arguing for some type of outcome equalizer
(3:32:29) basically some type of artificial I mean and I don't necessarily think that I would entirely disagree with that like for example I don't think that poverty
(3:32:35) should be a reason why someone should be and are two different things but I don't think it should should be a reason why
(3:32:41) someone receives either a worse education or less opportunities we should do what we reparations against
(3:32:46) reparations like like specifically like regarding slavery and things like that i haven't given a ton of thought to the
() 
(3:32:52) issue um you're a lawyer right you're gonna be a lawyer oh no i' I've thought about it um and I think what we should
(3:33:00) do regarding that is try to alleviate the injustice that's been done in terms of like I don't think we should give
(3:33:06) like cash payments or something like that like I just don't especially because of the way the system is set up and how fast a dollar circulates
(3:33:12) throughout like low-income communities if you just give them an influx of cash it'll just immediately go to the top so it's not actually going to solve the
(3:33:18) systemic issue goes right to Amazon yeah so I think instead we should do invest that money more effectively to solve a
(3:33:24) lot of those further systemic issues than just give people a bunch of money i don't think that's really gonna do much good so uh some people in the chat
(3:33:31) saying the audio has been low chat is the audio okay or am I also just not
(3:33:37) like sometimes close enough so low for me too or it might be that I'm not sure yeah sorry if I'm too far away from the mic we have Lulu here with a message
(3:33:44) thank you Lulu lulu donated $29.99 killed i teach Bob this was easy
(3:33:51) for you women hate you Oliver really you want women to go fight wars while you hide in the closet getting fisted brian
(3:33:59) would you pay for Oliver on a first date uh what here I got to play it watch what
(3:34:07) all right Lulu thank you for that um would I pay for Oliver on the first
(3:34:13) date he's not my type no offense wow no offense no offense no offense it's okay
(3:34:18) you weren't either damn but I just don't like podcast hosts so dagger to the heart um okay so if you guys want $30
(3:34:25) roast uh moving on to the next thing uh Oliver you in one of your Tik Toks why
(3:34:32) men should not be the leaders in relationships i don't know if that's like your position or
(3:34:38) like I don't think like I mean one of the prompts in the Jubilee video was like men should be the leader in like romantic relationships and I think that
(3:34:44) relationships are fundamentally a partnership between two people some people have strengths some people have weaknesses i think to say that like
(3:34:50) there ought to be a one-sizefits-all when people are so different um I think just I mean there's going to be some
(3:34:56) relationships where the man is more dominant and the woman is more submissive there's going to be some relationships where the woman takes a
(3:35:01) more dominant role and the man is submissive um and people will you know adhere to those preferences as they like
(3:35:06) but I don't know i think I think it reduces the complexity of people so much by saying that like men should be this
(3:35:12) and this relationship how do you deter determine who's a leader because you're getting you're getting into law right so
(3:35:18) isn't it the case that um when you like have a partnership in like a like a firm
(3:35:23) or a company someone has to take 51 and someone takes 49 i'm not I don't know i'm pretty sure that's the case and
(3:35:28) there's a pragmatic reason for obviously legality is that there has to be a guarantor and someone who actually has
(3:35:34) to say this way even if they're wrong you have to have someone pushing the button in the end and I feel like from a
(3:35:40) secular view which I assume you're secular um a relationship let's call it a marriage even a legal legal marriage
(3:35:48) it seems that you would probably um um determine one of them was the 51% leader
(3:35:56) why would we have that well because it's a legal it's a legal um contract so no
(3:36:01) the marriage is the company in But marriages aren't companies because they're not trying to turn a profit or make a I don't know well they kind of
(3:36:08) are trying to survive they're trying to They can be red they can be red line and black line so like sure i don't No I I I
(3:36:14) don't think there should be a 51% and 49% if that's the case if you want it to be that way then sure when people get
(3:36:20) married they should designate one of those people as it i don't think you know of course now you're going to make the argument it should oh it should be
(3:36:25) the man i don't I don't think there's necessarily a reason for why that should be the case that should be up to the individual in question who or
(3:36:31) individuals in question who are getting married if for some reason we decide that that should be the way that marriage should are you going to be the leader in your relationship no I'm not
(3:36:37) going to be the leader i don't think there should be a leader i I I I will lead sometimes i will i I I assume that
(3:36:43) my partner will lead sometimes what if she says "I want you to lead." Yeah then I will it depends what you mean by like
(3:36:49) lead i I don't I would never want my girl girlfriend to like take the backseat on everything what if she
(3:36:54) wanted to then I wouldn't date that person because I want someone who's also assertive who matches my intellect who I
() 
(3:37:01) feel is an kind kind of my intellectual equal whoa whoa whoa whoa you're this
(3:37:06) close to being gay no I don't no dude listen everyone listen in the audience look look look i don't want to date a
(3:37:13) man look I'm I'm 44 okay okay i'm assuming authority by age okay well
(3:37:22) so Bernie Sanders has authority over you then he's very old yeah he's he loves
(3:37:30) choice yeah i think that everyone should have an
(3:37:36) abortion that That's your guy you You voted for him i can't vote for Bernie Sanders i'm not a I'm not in Vermont oh
(3:37:44) um what was I asking you oh oh you said
(3:37:49) that you want an equal intellectual right what I'm I'm telling you men
(3:37:54) collectively generally are not they're they're more philosophical they're more
(3:38:00) they can do this yes no not inherently no I'm telling you not inherently no you're you're basically looking for a
(3:38:07) dude i'm not looking for a dude you are No I you are reducing you you're going to find a woman who can do everything
(3:38:12) that that that that provides you let's say being a wife being a mother of your children and because she's not going to
(3:38:18) get some stupid ass obscure philosophical [ __ ] school of thought you're going to be like she's not really
(3:38:24) philosophically no no you You are reducing just find the little Sally you are you are my you are reducing my
(3:38:30) preferences in a partner to a checklist like oh it has to be this it has to be this it has to be this it's not that way
(3:38:36) and that's not so she doesn't get your uh John Stewart Mill references is that a check is that a is that a actually a
(3:38:42) little bit I mean I it's um I I I do think it's the case so here here's an example of it and I think that I don't
(3:38:48) know this is what's wrong with men today no it's not they're looking for women to be men no they aren't because you're
(3:38:53) assuming that being smart and being intellectual are manly and I don't philosophical and new logic of course it
(3:39:00) is it's been historically manual historically why because they've been excluded from No no that's not it that's
(3:39:07) not it no even when you even the playing field right i think some Nordic country even the playing field it turns out like
(3:39:13) you just said minutes ago that the disparity ends up being a function of choice do you think that people exist in
(3:39:21) vacuums and are still not socialized into certain fields and thus the entire
(3:39:26) historical backdrop disappears once you go do what you want no generally women
(3:39:32) are not interested in philosophy and all this [ __ ] okay generally yeah that's true i don't I don't What do you mean no
(3:39:38) I don't find Okay cool i don't I don't care though then I'm going to find a woman who sat I I know plenty of women i
(3:39:44) have a philosophy i have a very I have a very good friend who's her um she she's at NYU and she's getting a PhD in
(3:39:50) philosophy and she's one of the smartest individ okay and so you're just going to find a
(3:39:57) woman who doesn't have kids who you can have masturbatory philosophical conversations here's the thing is then
(3:40:02) you are you are reducing types of intellectual conversation as to that look men I'm talking to you in the
(3:40:08) audience if you go on a date with a girl and she doesn't get your weird philosophical thing don't fret i think
(3:40:14) you're intimidated by women who might be smarter than you no it's that's not it i think it is are you intimidated Jim i
(3:40:19) think so are you intimidated the woman generally when you say
(3:40:27) stupid they should look at you with a blank stare no you want women to be dumb no i want them to be interested in what
(3:40:36) they're valued at what where they're valued yeah okay then you It's not dumb it's a It's an disinterest okay you
(3:40:43) called it dumb i'm calling it generally a disinterest more manly and intellectual
(3:40:49) well yes men and women are geared toward different things you just admitted this just minutes ago and now and now you're
(3:40:55) finding what and not inherently these are entire you are you are basing generalizations are not wait steady i
(3:41:01) don't think that women are less interested in philosophy and highbrow
(3:41:06) things because inherently they are women i think that society pushes them in a
(3:41:12) different direction and how would you know that because I've had conversations with women oh anecdotally look how look
(3:41:20) at I see Oliver if we did a poll for all the women and the answers came back I'm
(3:41:26) not interested in philosophy you would just say well you're just conditioned to be not interested
(3:41:32) all of us are i don't think men are inherently more interested in intellectual stuff than women if men are
(3:41:37) like yeah we're more in interested and I'd be like "Yeah society is structured in that way that makes sense." No I
(3:41:42) don't think so i think it has to do with the way men think is uh they think in in
(3:41:48) terms of like uh like systems and operations and doing stuff and activity
(3:41:54) and women are geared and I know women are geared toward systematizing people
(3:42:01) and no systematizing versus empathizing brains i've heard of this what study does it come from it comes from Simon Baron Cohen he did a not Yeah yeah Simon
(3:42:08) Baron Cohen that's a comedian no that's Satcha Baron Cohen they are related though um it comes from a study it comes
(3:42:14) from a study in which he did the primary study on toddlers and he determined that
(3:42:19) because the boy toddlers picked more masculine things and like and wanted to play with trucks and things like that
(3:42:25) and the girls Yeah it is and the girls wanted to play with dolls and things of that nature that therefore boys are more
(3:42:31) geared towards systematizing things and because it assumes that toddlers at that point are blank slates and are not
(3:42:37) already imbued with all of these gendered ideas no that's not it no no that's not the study the study was a was
(3:42:44) a was Nordic or Switzerland or one of those countries where he's the one who coined the term systematizing no they
(3:42:50) basically said "Okay everyone we're going to reset women get to do anything we're going to do a whole big big great
(3:42:57) social reset on expectations of men and women you think you can do that one hold on one year in one year how do you do
(3:43:03) that the women women it evened out that the women went toward for their own free their own free will by the way that's
(3:43:08) even example they no they went if you if you allow women to choose they choose uh
(3:43:15) fields geared like uh nursing administration
(3:43:20) teaching motherhood because their entire life No you're going to say they're conditions you don't you don't know
(3:43:26) because they're entire because that's how our society is oh you mean the history of all of humanity has it geared
(3:43:32) that women are are are geared toward those kind of behaviors and men are geared toward the other ones it's just
(3:43:38) societal construction right society has chosen Wait society has chosen to codify
() 
(3:43:45) physical realities into social realities because absolutely you couldn't wait you
(3:43:52) agree that it is you just think they also are biological you think they're biological and they're social and the
(3:43:58) social stems from the biological yeah it's informed yeah okay and I'm saying that just because something is ordered
(3:44:05) towards something if you didn't want to use that word I don't like that word because it invokes this type of arisatilian uh titlotoy look look it's
(3:44:12) simple look Oliver you couldn't use the social programming to supersede the
(3:44:18) biological presets of course you can no you can't how can you not how wait a
(3:44:23) second men would you agree are biologically more predisposed to aggression yeah okay then how can you
(3:44:29) socialize men so that they don't go on you know they don't go on mass murder sprees what do you mean that that's a
(3:44:36) way no the someone men could have a predisposition to aggression and express
(3:44:42) aggression without going on murder sp and you can but can you socialize men to be less aggressive you can try but it
(3:44:47) doesn't work what are you talking about the the the the public school system is a perfect example you know what you know
(3:44:52) what happens when you do that you then you psychize them and say "These boys
(3:44:58) are being very aggressive they're they're misbehaving." As opposed to "Uh no they're just boys let's give them
(3:45:04) let's give them rolin and give them drugs right because they're acting so boyish." That's crazy i I'm not
(3:45:09) advocating for overmedicalization if you're saying you can if you're saying you can socialize them out of
(3:45:15) being boys out of being boys but you're assuming that being a boy means expressing your aggression in a certain
(3:45:21) type of way i don't I think a lot of men know a language of violence and this
(3:45:27) comes back to the force doctrine type thing sure at the fundamental level
(3:45:33) violence is the way that power happens wait you don't you don't have older brothers do you um you have a younger
(3:45:38) sister i have no biological siblings oh okay that makes sense you should have been beaten up as a as a kid oh wow okay
(3:45:45) well from your brother i have three older brothers this makes a lot of sense why you hold the view no it's necessary
(3:45:50) mhm it's why big families are better is because they beat each other up well yeah it actually is a pecking order
(3:45:56) that's necessary for you to understand a place in the world now it's not an accident that you're an only child and
(3:46:02) you hold a female view of the world okay all right sounds good i mean I'm just
(3:46:08) saying you know if you want to dude you have the cap capacity to use aggression right of course I do okay when's the
(3:46:14) last time you used it use aggression yeah violence i didn't need to no when's
(3:46:20) the last time you did [Music] um I mean someone I can remember this I
(3:46:28) mean this is an example I brought up in one of my videos was I was on the subway in Washington DC and this guy sat down
(3:46:34) next to this girl and was being very creepy and inching towards her closer and I stared this dude dead in the eye and I would not take his eyes off him
(3:46:40) and literally like moved closer to him and he got up and left so that's an example of me using a male presence to
(3:46:47) get this and the presence is the conveying of the potential the potentiality of violence right yeah in a
(3:46:54) sense yeah right yeah so that's what's interesting is that the justice that you
(3:47:00) wanted to deploy rests wholly on the potentiality of force which is a woman
(3:47:07) couldn't do a woman couldn't do that there are different yeah absolutely men and women are viewed differently in society but go patriarchy hold on hold
(3:47:13) up no there are different ways to resolve certain conflicts i'm saying that you shouldn't resort to aggression
(3:47:21) when there are methods of communication that can lead to a more mutually understandable outcome like I don't if
(3:47:28) two people are having a disagreement is a fist fight usually the best way to solve that wait a second but Oliver in
(3:47:33) the example you gave me your communication was violence is next so it's still pointing to violence in Wait
(3:47:40) I'm saying in some Yes i'm not saying that viol I'm not saying that aggression is
(3:47:45) always wrong or that it should never be used you're saying negotiation first but even what I'm saying is that even if you
(3:47:52) go to negotiation first right this is like argumentation ethics it's like yeah you can use that and maybe lower the
(3:47:59) risk of being hurt yourself but ultimately you're making an or else statement what do you do this or else no
(3:48:08) if two people have a disagreement on something I don't think it has to escalate into violence no I'm not saying
(3:48:13) that i'm saying even if communication fails yeah you're going to know when violence is necessary
(3:48:20) and I think very often men believe violence is necessary and employ it when it is in fact not necessary someone said
(3:48:28) something mean about your mom and you decide the right response is to go beat the [ __ ] out of them no it's not it's
(3:48:34) not that's not You know what I think i think that's if you want to talk about I think it's men not knowing how to manage
(3:48:39) their emotions no I think the management of the emotion is conveyed through the fist i think that that is an incorrect
(3:48:47) uh management of emotions that causes much more harm and doesn't lead to any mutual understanding of hey let's not
(3:48:52) degrade women in order to kind of prop ourselves up as men you know what I mean that's what that type of thing is you
(3:48:58) know making insults towards people's mother so yeah I don't think you should do that
(3:49:04) and I don't think you should use violence to solve that well I think you should fight more okay well I'm not
(3:49:09) gonna uh Okay we're going to let a few more chats come through one more thing we'll do closing statements then we'll get this wrapped up we have uh Brett
(3:49:16) here thank you for the message Brett brett Shrivives donated $30 jim Bob W
(3:49:23) paradoxical Man Fighting on behalf of Feminist Mail uh Brett thank you for the message
(3:49:29) appreciate it we have Kit here thank you Kit coming in in just a moment i lowered TTS to 25 donated $30 W oliver for
(3:49:37) debating this guy did you guys ever agree on a definition of feminism
(3:49:43) uh pretty much i mean I pretty much accepted your term i I still kind of
(3:49:48) reduce it to power itself ends up being the the the thing that's really there
(3:49:55) like you can say like oh there's a structure and then there's people in positions of power and administrative
() 
(3:50:01) positions and all this but in the end it's like a bunch of dudes in a with guns are going to take over so I mean
(3:50:08) and I think the issue that I largely have with that is I agree on a base level that's you know yeah you know I I
(3:50:14) I actually agree with you that might makes you know whoever has it does however I think that might often has to
(3:50:20) be combined with some sort of strategical element you know what I mean it's not it's might might makes feminism
(3:50:27) you need to have some sort of enforcement mechanism i'm not deny so can you say it might look in the camera and say might makes feminism oh you're
(3:50:33) trying to to enforcement makes feminism enforcement fighting for stuff you believe in makes feminism men fighting
(3:50:40) makes feminism people fighting alongside each other and men fighting alongside women to defend their rights does make
(3:50:46) feminism you heard it here all right we have Ka thank you K also Kicker donated
(3:50:55) $29.99 can you honestly say feminism hasn't majorly caused gender wars lack
(3:51:00) of meaningful relationship and increased divorce rates i find that disingenuous
(3:51:06) if you think it's anything else but go on saying sure I can respond really quickly um yes you can i was there's a
(3:51:12) couple different things there I forgetting now it's like gender wars i don't think it's led to more gender wars i think it's led to women um not
(3:51:20) tolerating shitty behavior and not tolerating being put in a position where they are told what it means to be a
(3:51:25) woman and that they must adhere to this rigid set of social norms and if that pisses men off and men get mad at women
(3:51:31) for not wanting to submit to their demands uh that's not women's fault for
(3:51:36) you know you know demanding something different um and in the sense of like higher divorce rates this one always is
(3:51:42) really interesting because it's like oh you know when women make more money they get divorced more often as like oh
(3:51:47) that's a terrible thing it's like when women are financially independent when individuals are financially independent and not you know dependent on the other
(3:51:54) spouse uh yeah they might leave if they feel a relationship is unfair but if the relationship is unfair and they're not
(3:52:00) happy with the terms and uh they're not financially independent they don't have that financial luxury to leave that
(3:52:05) relationship so I don't think that's a counter whatsoever at all okay we have Selena thank you Selena selena Gomez
(3:52:13) donated $3210 he just made the female I've dated guys
(3:52:18) that met all my standards argument by pointing out how he's friend-zoned by the smartest girl he knows poor guy i'm
(3:52:26) not going to go into the details of that because I don't want to that is not actually what happened um
(3:52:34) no all right thank you Selena and then we have uh Oh wow sons of Liberty okay
(3:52:40) sons of Liberty donated $19.99 listen [ __ ] if my girl and I are in
(3:52:48) 1653 America I'm going out hunting and checking on threats at night she
(3:52:54) cleans/organizes the house garden and fixes i'm a little confused why you don't do that now natural states of men
(3:53:00) and women i'm confused i want to I want to add to this this is key i wish I brought it up more is that I did mention
(3:53:07) that what that chat is pointing to correctly saying is that uh feminism itself in its in its ideals is um a
(3:53:15) function of modernity and luxury and decadence in the instance where [ __ ] hits the fan no no listen just like
(3:53:22) gender uh pronouns and [ __ ] the I call it concerns that go with food shortages
(3:53:28) the moment the moment the scarcity hits and [ __ ] hits the fan these things are gone this makes total sense i don't see
(3:53:35) this is a bad thing at all no no wait a second it's called the fallacy of relative probation i don't know if you're familiar with it it's this idea
(3:53:41) that larger problems or larger injustices or larger pertinent needs diminish the severity or importance of
(3:53:47) smaller ones there's no injustice okay but then but then you're just making the No your fallacy is you're making you're
(3:53:54) making a circular argument hold on hold on you're saying these concerns aren't valid because you already don't agree
(3:53:59) with the concerns no even if I granted the concerns if I granted the concerns that there's there's this problem where
(3:54:06) where men are oppressing the women and there's all these like accepted expected um gender norms that are contrived and
(3:54:13) constructed what the what the person who just super chatted uh just basically demonstrated is that the argument that
(3:54:20) that gendered roles are constructs of modern modern times or whatever the
(3:54:25) society is goes away as soon as the society breaks down and you're back in the woods what happens when you're back
(3:54:32) in the woods dude yeah I agree but what were it kind of advanced beyond that
(3:54:37) right no no the point is the advancement that feminism and this sort of
(3:54:42) delusional take is a symptom of decadence and luxury the moment that's
(3:54:48) removed like there's if there's a bomb dropping on some chick's head so you know and she she gets bur buried in the
(3:54:55) uh rubble and someone goes "Let's help her." The last thing on their mind is correcting the pronoun same thing with
(3:55:01) feminist of course I don't disagree with that that's just the that's just the factual claim that you should focus on
(3:55:07) larger problems over smaller ones actually wait i want to probably agree with you here a little bit i think the
(3:55:13) left and this is a mistake that the left often makes is they hyperfixate on infighting and over who's right over
(3:55:20) winning power i completely agree a lot that you know it doesn't matter how right you are if you don't have power if
(3:55:26) you don't have the ability to enforce what you you know want to do so it it you know all of these all these people
(3:55:31) on the left who are like you know we need to you know correct this person on this or we need to completely shun them from our movement because they express
(3:55:38) this one view that differs slightly from us they're hurting our cause so I will call that out any day as saying we need
(3:55:44) to have a bigger tent and not a smaller tent and I think that this idea of you know shunning people or like you know
(3:55:51) saying that these things are I don't know irredeemable like just like insane
(3:55:56) I don't I don't agree with that so okay we have two more coming in selena Gornz
(3:56:01) thank you selena Gomez donated $2345 of course that isn't what happened
(3:56:08) poor guy i honestly feel for you but I can see you're smart so I think you will
(3:56:14) come around eventually i think this is in response to the something about being
(3:56:19) friend-zoned or something yeah I don't I'm not I'm not going to I'm not going to divulge the details of a personal situation sir but what the Oliver's
(3:56:27) mother donated $20 brian could you move that dumpy i can't see Jim Bob's
(3:56:33) shoulders thank you slowly but surely that's crazy uh thank you uh thank you
(3:56:39) for that message all right uh final thing here from you Oliver then we'll do
(3:56:44) closing statements uh there was this prompt on your TikTok is mis misandry
(3:56:49) more loud than misogyny mis or misandry yeah misandry yeah what What's your position on that yeah I kind of already
() 
(3:56:56) did we already go we didn't talk about that specifically but I into Sorry we didn't talk about that specifically but
(3:57:01) I mean we that's what I talked about in the Jubilee video that I was a part of i mean I do think misogyny is much more
(3:57:06) prevalent than misandry hatred of women is much more prevalent than the hatred of men um you know all a lot of these
(3:57:12) things that we conceive of as hatred I just fundamentally don't think are actually hating men can you give us some
(3:57:19) examples of that sure like examples of like so for example if women express I hate men um I think very often we
(3:57:25) understand we we very often understand people's nonliteral use of language so for example if I say oh my god I'm so
(3:57:32) mad I'm going to kill him but you never actually kill someone it's plausible to say you don't actually want to kill this
(3:57:39) person and same thing with kill all men same thing with with uh with like I I hate men these women obviously don't
(3:57:46) hate men considering most of them have men in their lives that they love they have uh you know uh many of them can be
(3:57:52) in relationships when they're saying that they're expressing a dissatisfaction with the way that society is structured and how a certain
(3:57:58) portion of men are treating them so I don't think that is indicative of the hatred of men it's the hatred of how men
(3:58:05) are treating them so I don't I don't see an example of misandry that is brought
(3:58:12) up that can parallel the fact that like three women die a day in this country due to intimate partner violence at the
(3:58:18) hands primarily of men so except for lesbian relationships they're pretty aggressive i don't I don't pretty high
(3:58:25) rate of uh pulling each other's hair okay i I have not looked into the I don't I don't have anything to comment
(3:58:31) on that because I have not looked into uh I actually I mean I kind of agree with you generally that like the hate I
(3:58:37) don't this term hatred of from either side is very hard to judge i just think there's uh I think there's
(3:58:45) misinterpretations of uh of how women think of men and how men think of women
(3:58:50) i think the MIGTOW thing is a little bit you can kind of isolate that i think
(3:58:55) exploring some of that MIG Tower are you aware of what that is it's like men going their own way kind of thing i
(3:59:00) think that's a misstep for men and like like abandon women yeah the whole like Yeah like that's I think that's a
(3:59:07) mistake um and that's the closest thing I could get to like you know misogyny as
(3:59:13) far as their rhetoric but men who want women to be in at the in the home I think that's a value of women and I
(3:59:19) think people who are in your view perhaps need to consider that maybe the person who's arguing for that is
(3:59:26) actually thinks wholeheartedly that the best place for them for women is
(3:59:31) actually is actually I think I think relegating a whole subset of human
(3:59:36) beings who are so diverse in their wants desires and needs i don't care about their desires yeah thank you for
(3:59:43) expressing that you don't care about the Why would they No dude my own obl Look but my own obligations as a father isn't
(3:59:50) based on my desires either so it's not like it's not like men are saying we get
(3:59:55) to fulfill our desires and we don't want women to you are fulfilling what you believe are the ideal desires of women
(4:00:02) against their wishes well no men have to do that too because not all men men
(4:00:07) don't generally wish to put themselves in the line of fire to defend this this
(4:00:13) weird abstract idea of women's liberation either what are you talking women expect men to hold the obligation
(4:00:20) to defend their rights women expect men to use the power and privilege that they
(4:00:26) have to defend and men expect women to fulfill their obligation of having
(4:00:31) children being a mother that's not how the obligation goes why not who says who hold on no because this I don't think
(4:00:37) that there's this somehow reciprocaless because what you're saying is basically because you are in need and
(4:00:44) I can help you I'm going to leverage the fact that I have more power over you to
(4:00:50) get something out of you and I think that's really leverage yeah yeah it is no it's it's not even used as leverage
(4:00:56) is basically just stating the fact if men have the obligation and the fulfillment of using their bodies and
(4:01:02) and protecting women and upholding the the the literal the the actual nation in
(4:01:07) its logistics and how it operates from the from bridges to to [ __ ] everything else dude hold on so So women get to
(4:01:14) float around in this perfect society a Sims made just for them and and they and
(4:01:20) feminists like you and other women say "Well men you know you guys have to defend our rights right?" And then we go
(4:01:27) men are obligated to be good yeah but what are we getting in return you shouldn't you shouldn't need something in return to be to be a good person so
(4:01:33) to maintain society we shouldn't expect from women to participate in the procreation of society they absolutely
(4:01:39) should participate in the procreation of society should we expect them to um I think that if a man wants to marry a woman and wants to have sex Absolutely
(4:01:47) how no no wait a second i'm not at all i'm claiming No no no wait i am claiming that Okay what are we going to do this
(4:01:53) okay if Are you going to let me make my point yeah one more time okay sexist yeah you're going to say it again okay
(4:01:58) if if we're expecting men to um have you men are allowed to have preferences men are allowed to say "Look I don't want to
(4:02:04) marry a woman who doesn't want children cuz children are important to me." There's nothing sexist about that there's nothing sexist about that what's
(4:02:10) sexism what's sexism define it i'll let you have your definition of it sure my definition of it I would say that it would be um contempt for or you know
(4:02:18) double standards double standards on the basis of sex sex cool so isn't it a
(4:02:24) double standard that women and society at large depend and expect i didn't
(4:02:30) didn't add something to my definition like unfair or like ungrounded so unfair I don't know who's determining fair but
(4:02:36) isn't it the case that it would be sexist which I have no problem be people being sexist yeah no surprise there well
(4:02:42) no it's not a wrong thing if if sexist means simply to assume obligation or
(4:02:48) expectation from one sex based on sex alone mhm yeah no is that sexist uh yeah i know you should do that inherently on
(4:02:54) sex hold on do you accept do you expect men being the collective body of force
(4:02:59) to defend and uphold the the justice system and law and order and not because they're men but because they're stronger
(4:03:04) and those things are different they are different wait a minute it's not because if there are women who are stronger they
(4:03:12) also have the obligation to protect those who are less vulnerable than them it's not because they are male it's
(4:03:19) because they are strong okay oh and and women are capable of having children so
(4:03:25) how is it that you're deriving how is it you're deriving an obligation for men and women based on their strength which
(4:03:31) is an immune like some characteristics of their body and being able to have children is another characteristic of a
(4:03:37) body but you're not applying obligations to that wait I think that people in general h I I don't because I don't
(4:03:42) think there needs to be reproductive obligations because I think we can get to the society well not really the now
(4:03:49) which is like 1.2 you're under replacement we are under replacement and this is some stats and stuff that I
(4:03:54) brought up we see and I I closed my iPad so I'm not going to bring up the exact stats right now we see a large return to
(4:04:01) replacement in societies that emphasize having stronger social programs and economic programs you mean immigration
(4:04:07) no not immigration i was not even talking about immigration i'm talking about social programs i'm talking about making it financially more feasible to have children having things like
(4:04:13) universal health care making it more easy for people to receive educations and things like that we see people willingly and voluntarily start families
(4:04:19) because it is easy to do so so we don't have to tell women they have to be in the home instead i've already debunked
(4:04:25) that because there are poor people who don't have any social programs and they're having a lot of more kids what happens is it a good thing or a bad
(4:04:31) thing it's fine for them cuz they have What do you mean why is it is it a good or a bad thing to have cuz you I assume
(4:04:37) Wait hold on do you think it's a problem of there being a I started having people who are dependent on the government like
(4:04:42) all the people people Oh these people are poor and they're having children and they're just like on welfare argued "Dude you just contradicted yourself you
(4:04:48) said "Let's start a welfare system that aids people to have kids and then you're
(4:04:54) saying and I go I point to poor people and right I point to poor people having more kids and you go "Yeah but welfare
(4:05:00) is that's not a good thing." And a lot of you you guys on your side of the aisle wherever that is um don't want you
(4:05:07) know like you know if you can't afford to have a kid don't don't have a kid maybe maybe you're not arguing no I had
(4:05:12) a kid when I was poor as [ __ ] okay no I think that I think I don't think that
(4:05:18) like that's just a preference it's like you think you're ready uh when you have money to have a kid but having a kid
(4:05:24) isn't reduced to materialism and providing only there's this whole other set of having a child right financially
(4:05:30) take care of a child do you think it's responsible for them to have a child yeah they can still raise a child who's
(4:05:36) poor i grew up poor sure dude dude I come from a family of five and we're dirt poor so I don't understand okay and
(4:05:42) do you think it on balance is better if people sometimes it's worse if they're rich okay i I don't I I think that were
(4:05:49) you rich holding all else equal was he rich um trust fund what no no trust fund almost i mean my dad was a trumpet
(4:05:57) player in the orchestra so he was a musician for a long period of time so he was poor they make bank the trumpet oh
(4:06:02) do they the trumpet first no not really is there a first second chair in trumpet he was he was first but you still don't
(4:06:07) get that much in the arts yeah that makes sense yeah it's the arts i mean he's a virtuoso right he's he's a very
(4:06:14) He was a very good trumpet player i mean he was the only guy I've gotten into Giuliard the year he graduated so good guy did he force you away from music he
(4:06:21) was like "Be a lawyer." He didn't force me away i actually It was funny i tried to take trumpet lessons from him and he was like "Well why would I why would I
(4:06:28) uh why would I teach you No why would I teach you trumpet lessons you don't listen to me with other things as a
(4:06:33) parent i You don't listen to other things I say." I'm like "Yeah Dad but when it comes to trumpet you actually know what you're talking about." So He
(4:06:40) didn't like that like are you more of a saxophone guy i'm not really i'm I mean I did musical theater for a while but I
(4:06:47) could see that performing arts this is a type of 5,7,600 you were in Rent weren't you

(4:11:37) get Bob another beer and a Shirley Temple for the Froot Loop oliver was getting turned on watching Bob
(4:11:43) obliterate him he's hoping to go him with him or Brian tonight dude don't
(4:11:48) don't spoil it i was trying to make donated $20 oliver if I was the youngest
(4:11:55) you were the oldest time he felt his response was worth 20 bucks i think it's really Thank you Wi-Fi uh we have a big
(4:12:01) super chat here chef Dylan by the way guys so anytime you see a soup chat and
(4:12:06) it's like uh 99 cents usually that means that you sent it through uh Apple iOS so
(4:12:13) you sent it through like iPhone iPad whatever so apparently I just learned this%
(4:12:20) yeah Apple takes 30% and then YouTube after that takes 30% oh so if it's if
(4:12:26) it's $100 40 they end up taking a total of uh 51 so you're left with 49 so it's
(4:12:33) already bad just doing it through YouTube they take 30 but if you do it through YouTube on iOS so Apple iOS yeah
(4:12:42) I'm uh I'm challenged english is my uh second language what was your first French oh yeah so that's why I butchered
(4:12:50) misendry misandry earlier if you caused an accident you would have to give up your autonomy to pay the person with
(4:12:56) your money earned through your body's actions i mean sure but then this kind of just breaks down to the distinction
(4:13:01) of is there a meaningful distinction between your money and your body and you know there there's you know the libertarians till they're blue in the
(4:13:07) face will say that taxation is slavery because you're taxing my money which I get through my labor which is taxing my
(4:13:12) labor i don't know i intuitively there intuitively to me there's a difference between someone taxing money um and like
(4:13:19) demanding that I donate a pint of blood to cancer research or something so I I I
(4:13:24) don't think they're necessarily equivalent and I think there's an argument to be made that there is a difference between the two that the reason we're justified in having someone
(4:13:31) pay damages if they're in an accident is acceptable but like giving up their kidney would be like a massive bridge
(4:13:38) too far and so speaking of that guys if you're watching and you're using uh iPhone iPad to send in the super
(4:13:46) chats YouTube and Apple have taken $100 of this so you know you want Streamlabs
(4:13:53) Venmo Cash App here you can uh cuz you know you these woke mega corpse you want
(4:14:01) to support the whatever podcast don't give it to them you know so anyways uh okay thank you Chef Dylan for the soup
(4:14:08) chat though much appreciated and uh all right so we're going to do closing since
(4:14:13) uh you went first uh Jim Bob you're going to go first with uh your closing statement and Oliver you'll go last all
(4:14:19) right well first of all thanks Oliver for coming out and uh Brian for powering through this um so yeah feminism you
() 
(4:14:27) know the main the main thing with feminism is it's often argued that it's the just thing to do it's what we should
(4:14:34) we should move forward toward something but when we ask the the person the proponent of feminism what it looks like
(4:14:40) it every time it ultimately relies on men um uh fulfilling this duty of
(4:14:46) upholding this society so that women could pretend that they have liberty really it's just an allowance so if the
(4:14:54) if if uh feminism is merely an allowance from men the question is okay if men are
(4:15:00) allowing you liberty what is the exchange that we get from women which
(4:15:06) comes down to obligations ultimately so from the uh affirmative position tonight
(4:15:11) there is no real obligations uh he prefers that men hold an obligation to
(4:15:16) defend society defend rights um even though uh it's a sexist view because it's it's an expectation of men um to do
(4:15:25) things that you don't expect of women collectively because you know that there is no society that upholds its rights
(4:15:32) its justice system its law without the collective of primarily men even if
(4:15:37) there's some butch chicks who can join the squad it doesn't matter ultimately the reality
(4:15:43) is females want liberation but they ask for it and the reason they ask for it is
(4:15:48) because they can't give themselves liberation they they aren't collectively capable of giving themselves liberation
(4:15:56) men are capable collectively of giving themselves liberation and taking liberation so the question for feminists
(4:16:03) is always the same thing do you expect men who hold the enforcement arm to
(4:16:10) provide for you to have your liberation and they say yes we ask them what are you going to do with it they said "We're
(4:16:16) going to work for Nike and abort our own kids that's what we get in return for giving women liberation we're going to
(4:16:22) vote for uh basically expanded welfareism we're going to turn the government into a daycare
(4:16:30) system this is what you get from feminism feminism takes what's powerful and
(4:16:36) beautiful and right and good about women sex their sex their ability to procreate
(4:16:43) and their ability to be mothers it inverts it and sells it to them to to
(4:16:49) waste it away in their most fertile years uh by starting Only Fans account
(4:16:54) and uh and adding their body count to upwards to 50 to 100 it's garbage it's
(4:17:00) trash uh no man should support uh female liberation or feminism it has failed
(4:17:05) it's at its its uh peak it's at the end glory to God and uh the next phase is
(4:17:11) back to the home and no it's not oppressive when women were back in the home when when women were were raising
(4:17:19) children they were revered they were protected they were seen as um as as the
(4:17:25) class of people that nobody messed with and they said "Well against the rest of
(4:17:31) the women can we just get ourselves into to these high-rise offices and give me a
(4:17:36) lanyard i can't wait to acrue debt it's amazing i'm liberated." You're not liberated you're living a lie feminism
(4:17:44) is a lie and like I said before feminism requires the patriarchy anyway and uh
(4:17:52) with that thanks again for coming out okay Oliver go ahead all right well I had a prepared closing statement but
(4:17:58) since this really didn't go according to any sort of a you know guideline that I
(4:18:04) thought um I'll just kind of say my final thoughts here um I think there still is a massive is ought claim that
(4:18:12) is being made you know you can you can say till you're blue in the face that this is how society is this is how it fundamentally will be if we're left to
(4:18:19) our own devices but I think one of the beautiful things about humans is that we have the capacity for reason and we have
(4:18:25) the capacity to better our society against our biological impulses and I
(4:18:31) think that that is something that feminism advocates uh feminism does not say that you know denies the difference
(4:18:37) between men and women denies that you know men are on average stronger than women it says to men look you you do
(4:18:43) have this power you are stronger um you know you ought to use it in such a way that does not hurt individuals and
(4:18:50) there's a element of paternalism here i mean you heard Jim Bob a lot compare you know like treating women to treating
(4:18:57) children and you know I I think it's a problem is these people fundamentally and he's nodding right now view women as
(4:19:02) infants view women as infantilized and I think that that is why feminism is so
(4:19:08) necessary and continue to fight against these ideas where you know that these people do not view women as you know
(4:19:15) rational human beings i mean we had this whole conversation surrounding intellect and I think that you know it's really unfortunate that this is the type of uh
(4:19:23) ideas that are becoming more and more prevalent um and I think that as long as these ideas are continuing to be uh
(4:19:28) spread it only proves the further need for feminism um I really wasn't able to get into a lot of the empirics of the
(4:19:34) good things of feminism um but there have been many uh advancements and benefits since the uh arrival of
(4:19:41) feminism and can be directly attributed to it um society works better when men and women work alongside each other not
(4:19:47) um you know one person designated to the home one in the workplace but alongside each other as you know definitely
(4:19:54) intellectual equals and realizing that physical reality uh does not is not
(4:19:59) determinant it does not determine things necessarily you know the strong ought not rule the weak um and the strong even
(4:20:07) if they have the power to um make others submit to their will i think one of the most you know defining things about
(4:20:14) masculinity is um using your you know power effectively and using your power to benefit uh the less welloff and um
(4:20:22) those who are at a disadvantage um and not using it to further oppress them so in that sense I think that's why
(4:20:28) feminism is necessary and you know I hope that we will see um more uh views
(4:20:35) of this nature um proliferate and less of a slide back towards this view that women uh you know have this role that
(4:20:41) they ought to be in so um I think a society is better when um we trust women and it is in the virtue of trusting
(4:20:48) women that I um affirm that feminism has caused great benefits to society and is
(4:20:53) overall a good for society so that's all I got all right thank you both uh thank
(4:20:59) you to both of you for uh doing the debate i thought it was uh I thought it was really good uh Oliver we actually
(4:21:05) have you back in I think about two weeks you're going to be facing up against uh Andrew Wilson for a sort of similar
(4:21:12) debate uh a couple final things here i'm going to read super chat christopher if
(4:21:17) you're saying men have an obligation to protect because they have the bi biology to do so but women don't have an
(4:21:22) obligation to bear children even though they have the biology to do so where is the equality quick answer on this if
(4:21:28) you'd like i can give an answer i've given this before um one there might be
(4:21:34) some sort of parallel here if the empirical claim was correct that if women are not in the home they
(4:21:42) fundamentally will not have children and there's no way to rectify that through societal programs and economic
(4:21:48) enhancement i don't think that's the case so it is true that those who are stronger have an obligation to protect
(4:21:55) those who are weaker use that um to their um benefit i do think that society
(4:22:01) is better off if people reproduce and I think there are ways in which it doesn't have to be a trade-off women do not have
(4:22:08) to give up their autonomy and their liberty and their freedom in order to be you know breeding stock um we we can
(4:22:15) have our cake and eat it too actually um and it doesn't have to be one or the other so I think this unfairly falsely
(4:22:21) dichomizes an issue that um in which we can have both at the same time got it and we have two uh Streamlabs messages
(4:22:28) coming in here i apologize my mic was turned the other way i was just saying that Oliver will be joining us in about
(4:22:34) two weeks for he's has a one-on-one debate with Andrew Wilson so that'll be
(4:22:39) good be sure to tune in for that we have Selena here thank you Selena Gour
(4:22:44) donated $2345 are you live tomorrow will Jim Bob
(4:22:50) be there too he's pretty funny i really appreciate how unapologetic him and
(4:22:55) Andrew are all three of you are dope don't stop doing what you do you're
(4:23:00) needed yes Selena thank you we will be live uh tomorrow should be a a good
(4:23:06) panel with our dating talk total bluff donated $20 what the [ __ ]
(4:23:12) the feminist sounds like such a kitten trump would probably grab him by the mouth
(4:23:17) this is the environment that's cultivated just want to say that
(4:23:24) you mean people like [ __ ] posting in the chat you mean the internet the the internet the internet at large um I mean
(4:23:30) have you seen chicks what they say i mean are they making comments about
(4:23:36) grabbing people's genitalia i mean yeah i think largely that's not a societal
(4:23:42) epidemic of women assaulting uh one question for you on that when it came
(4:23:47) you you mentioned Trump's statements as it relates to like the grab them by the you know Yeah um when you were talking
(4:23:54) about the differences between misogyny and mis um misandry you were saying when
(4:23:59) women say for example uh kill all men or men are trash men suck or what whatever
(4:24:06) what was the other one uh I don't know i hate men i hate men uh I mean if if you're sort of I guess if you're uh
() 
(4:24:14) dismissing when women say this then couldn't you also apply this to basically any negative statement towards
(4:24:21) women or minorities because the power differential is not there it's it's here we go if we take take a look at this um
(4:24:27) in general do you think it's kind of like I you probably will bite this bullet but do you think it's morally
(4:24:32) equivalent when like a white person calls a black person the n-word versus when um like a black person uses the
(4:24:38) word cracker to refer to a white person do you think uh don't use that but I can't use that word yeah just say like the C word it's okay just the C word is
(4:24:44) not that but All right well just for the sake of the stream it's YouTube and Twitch okay fine do you think those two
(4:24:50) things are like a like equip like we could argue that maybe like neither of them is great but like you think they're
(4:24:56) like historical context the n-word was the last word that a lot of black people heard before they were like I don't know
(4:25:02) how can I say lynched like you know lynched yeah so like that has a much bigger societal connotation than that
(4:25:10) word the cword that just gets like just do do you think uh sexism can exist
(4:25:16) towards men well that's the idea of Missandrea i think it can exist um and I think a lot of examples of misandry are
(4:25:22) almost kind of like manifestations of misogyny so the idea is that like men can't feel emotions or that men just
(4:25:28) have to man up or that male victims of abuse aren't actually valid because or like if a man is abused by a woman it's
(4:25:35) like dude you should feel lucky like I like the whole like school teacher thing like if a guy sleeps with uh his teacher
(4:25:41) it's like oh you know he's he's really lucky for that it's like no he's groomed he was groomed by that and I think that
(4:25:46) like that type of dismissiveness of male trauma could be categorized as a form of misandry like unfair but I think that is
(4:25:53) an example of the societal standards we have and how they negatively affect men so yeah so but just to be clear like
(4:26:00) hateful statements said towards men it's okay because it's not the power
(4:26:06) dynamics i think when we're talking about statements like I hate men i and this is I don't know if it's something
(4:26:12) I've revised my position on um doesn't always fully have is it probably ideal
(4:26:18) for people to say what they mean um when they're saying stuff i think so i think
(4:26:23) it is probably best clear up confusion um you don't want like anyone to get the wrong message however I think people use
(4:26:30) nonliteral forms of language all the time if someone says like "Oh my god I'm
(4:26:35) going to kill him i'm so mad." No one literally interprets that as like they're going to kill this person
(4:26:41) especially if they've never killed anyone women are not in mass numbers or even really any significant number
(4:26:47) offing men that's just it's not something that's happening men are not a serious systemic risk of violence from women yeah it might hurt some feelings
(4:26:54) and maybe it's not like a great thing to do especially maybe if you're trying to get people on your side but the way that I view that type of discourse is women
(4:27:00) have been asking politely to be treated better by men for so long hey we'd like it if you stop doing this and this is
(4:27:06) actually getting men's attention it's like oh my god you say you hate me now I'm listening and I think in that sense
(4:27:12) it is you know somewhat like you know pjorative and it might turn them off but it at least gets them like having their
(4:27:17) ears open instead of just completely that stupid feminism stuff what you hate me I'm going to listen i'm going to listen even if it is with a critical eye
(4:27:24) at least they're engaged in some sort of conversation i mean don't you think that in terms of the there's like I don't
(4:27:31) know if you've seen like that adolescence show i've seen it you know there's all these criticisms of uh you
(4:27:36) know Manosphere stuff or this this uh young
(4:27:42) boys finding an interest in Andrew Tape for example yeah um seems
(4:27:48) like this narrative of just sort of open uh manhatred
(4:27:55) that's kind of pushing people in that direction i mean maybe so I I guess I I would I would I would ask you then I mean this is really interesting
(4:28:00) conversation what are some examples of like misandry that you see or like hatred of men that you see are like
(4:28:06) prevalent in society h I mean just utterances okay individual
(4:28:12) utterances i mean and do you think that like always
(4:28:17) people's words should be understood literally if I say "Oh my god slay." Do you think I'm going to kill you slay i I
(4:28:25) don't think that's fair though i think that's totally different than Why well I think there's a difference between
(4:28:30) hyperbole that is hyperbole i hate men women do you do you really think that a majority of women genuinely hate all men
(4:28:39) of course not well perhaps they don't hate all men they have like perhaps a generalized Well okay for example if a
(4:28:44) white person said uh the same thing about black people would you like take them at face value or to be like eh
(4:28:50) they're just joking well first off the hatred of white people towards black people has historically throughout
(4:28:55) history been designed to like it was not in any way like rooted in like a reality
(4:29:02) you know what I mean like that that's just that's just racism it's not like it's not they're not they're not it's also a little bit like if if if a black
(4:29:09) the correct response was like if a black person says like I hate white people because of racist experiences that they'd experienced like I don't I think
(4:29:16) that just in general is that okay like I just I think there are black
(4:29:22) people to hate white people black people do hate white people or youth no hate i don't think you should women hating all
(4:29:29) men there is this type of like biological essentialism which says that men because of who they are are
(4:29:35) inherently evil i've seen this in like very few corners of the internet that's just like you don't want to go there
(4:29:42) that's not a good place that's that's wrong those women are doing something that is bad you should not genuinely
(4:29:47) think that like men because of their biology or their genetics or their Y chromosome are somehow like evil that's
(4:29:53) not the sentiment that is largely being expressed in my view when women say I hate men and the reason is because it it
(4:30:01) it's never the behavior does not match the words which makes me which makes it
(4:30:07) an insincere form of hatred you're not you don't actually hate these people would you give this same grace to men
(4:30:13) who said the same thing towards women no because women act Wait a second because men Wait a second men know Because men
(4:30:18) actually take out their hatred on women by killing them well women poison men all the time well okay i need more
(4:30:26) examples of like who do you think kills Do you think men kill more women or women kill more men what do you think is a more systemic pervasive issue men kill
(4:30:32) more men though do they hate men no using the same logic because they're men because they're Do men kill men because
(4:30:39) men no they kill women because they don't view women what you're talking about is violence by proximity you're
(4:30:45) saying it's not it's violence that occurs because No you're using You're using the reasoning that if men kill
(4:30:50) women it's because they hate women but when they kill men it's just wait because they don't in a lot of these cases it's because they don't view women
(4:30:58) as full people or worthy of respect yeah i think about it all the time the stalker case a woman turns down a man's
(4:31:03) advances he follows her home and he kills her that's not an uncommon thing that unfortunately happens so that is
(4:31:10) that's pretty uncommon i mean in the grand scheme of things yeah it it does i mean in terms of in terms of like in
(4:31:15) terms of like intimate partner violence three women per day are killed by men
(4:31:20) yeah but partner the the domestic violence um for lesbian couples is I
(4:31:25) don't I don't higher so do they hate women do are they killing are they are lesbians killing each other they're not
(4:31:31) if they were cap if they were stronger they would i don't think that's true i think if someone wants to kill someone they they would be able to do I mean
(4:31:36) women women can't even successfully off themselves okay yeah they do they f they
(4:31:43) Yeah they they attempt at similar rates men do more because they're use more useful methods they're just better at it i I think saying men are better at
(4:31:50) killing themselves and that's a good thing about men is crazy but um No I didn't say it's good i said they're better at it doesn't make sense it's not
(4:31:56) a good Well and and if we're talking about why that's the case I think the male suicide rate is a problem and I
(4:32:02) think that we should and we should encourage men to instead of like bottling up and never talking about
(4:32:07) their like feelings you just have to man up you have to get through it emotions are just a woman's thing and you should
(4:32:13) not I don't know about that i actually wonder how many uh men ended up you know
(4:32:20) taking themselves out of the equation that um at the tail end of looking too
(4:32:26) introspectively about all that i don't think that's the case i mean there are specific studies that I found and this was one that I found when I was
(4:32:31) preparing for the other debate that I did and it was men that hold particular views such as you know a lot of more
(4:32:36) traditional views like you hold you know this idea of like depression isn't really a real thing or like it's like a weakness of the mind and you know that
(4:32:43) you know they just need to man up and grit and power through and that men have you know this role to be like super
(4:32:48) aggressive they're more than two like two times as likely to kill themselves that there's a study i can actually
(4:32:54) provide you a study if you'd like un alive or unive oh my bad sorry alive yeah on alive themselves who hold those
(4:33:01) views i mean there's a study out there so I better understand can you further explain the whole like okay when women
(4:33:07) say uh I hate men all men suck whatever it is you give them a bit of grace on
(4:33:13) that statement but if a man says "I hate all women," or whatever it is why do women Why do women What teaches women to
(4:33:20) be afraid of men answer my question well I But I think this is instructive i think I'm I'm going to answer your question so what's your question well my
(4:33:26) question is why do you think women are afraid of men or might express that as I hate men why maybe uh sure either uh
() 
(4:33:34) they've had a specific poor or bad incident with a particular man they've heard from a friend that this person has
(4:33:40) had a bad experience they've they have a society and culture that uh pushes forth
(4:33:46) certain messaging when it comes to this there's the perhaps you might even agree with this uh the the news cycle
(4:33:52) basically has people on high alert all the time because they're just f
(4:33:57) hyperfocusing on these otherwise pretty rare occurrences and it's just a constant flow of like here's a terrorist
(4:34:04) attack here's sure you know whatever it is and and from talking with the women in my lives and you know what and like
(4:34:12) at least from what I've heard women I've listened to you know these types of experiences especially like you know
(4:34:17) unwanted sexual encounters or sexual assault or sexual harassment are scarily
(4:34:22) common like really common like it's like every I mean I I I'd encourage you guys you know to talk to the women in your
(4:34:28) life just like ask them hey have you had type of experience and and it's like it's it's fairly common so I think
(4:34:34) women's fear of men and sometimes their what what they express as hatred is a
(4:34:39) hatred with how they're being treated and I realize they're not being perfect with language and one could argue that
(4:34:46) instead of saying I hate men they should say I hate the way some men treat me and I totally understand that you know look
(4:34:53) I I struggle with this a lot too i'm a man when you say you you hate all men I'm offended because I'm a member of
(4:34:59) that category and I feel that you're somehow imputing me for the actions of this shitty guy that I had nothing to do
(4:35:04) with but I think what happens is when we do that we're focusing on tone policing
(4:35:11) women more and make we're making it about ourselves in a sense we're making it we're saying like I hear what I
(4:35:17) instead of looking and listening to the message you're giving me I'm going to immediately get on the defensive and
(4:35:22) make it about me you know what I mean so maybe actually Brian in an ideal world you're right women in a perfect world or
(4:35:29) like in a way where like you know if if I were to advise a woman what should she say she should say you know I hate the
(4:35:36) way that some men treat me but I think that as men we should use our big brain reasoning ability to say that look okay
(4:35:42) women say they hate men but and all those women who go to the women's marches that you know Jim Bob thinks are
(4:35:47) facades um and say that you know we hate men you know blah blah blah and then they go home to men in their lives and
(4:35:54) then they go you know have men in their life that they love they don't actually hate men what they're doing is they're
(4:36:00) expressing a type of discontent and albeit probably imperfect language in language that is less than optimal
(4:36:08) whatsoever at all but I just I I think fixating on this idea that like this is
(4:36:13) systemic hatred of men just like it's it's it's it's really bad can you can
(4:36:19) you repeat that yeah what what specifically i'm just kidding i was just kidding no uh you're going to make a
(4:36:25) great lawyer yeah i mean but the thing is though is that I don't think I I I actually don't
(4:36:32) dispute that uh many women uh have had bad encounters with men yeah I don't
(4:36:37) dispute this um I've had bad encounters with men i've had bad encounters with women i think though when you're going
(4:36:43) to make statements like this uh one I just it's blatantly sexist but the other
(4:36:49) thing I would say is that like again if if we sort of shift things a little bit
(4:36:54) and we replace men with a racial group you'd be like whoa okay that for example
(4:36:59) if a white person anecdotally they had multiple bad experiences with uh a
(4:37:07) racial minority who who in that racial minority what do you mean cuz I hear his talking I I hear his talking point a lot
(4:37:13) it's like oh black men are violent this type of thing i'm not saying I'm not saying you're saying that i'm saying that but It doesn't matter who it is i
(4:37:19) think I think it can be i think it can be but the common denominator there would be a man so if someone were hating like um like I guess like like oh yeah I
(4:37:27) have a prejudice against African-Americans because like an African-American like man once caused
(4:37:32) this it's it's the male component that's doing the work there because I don't think they would be afraid of like black women necessarily if they had a let's
(4:37:39) just say they just had a blanket uh they've had bad experiences with black men and black women and they have they
(4:37:46) they make certain negative statements about I hate exracial and I think it's
(4:37:52) because throughout society that statement has never been understood to
(4:37:58) mean we have we don't like the way I had this bad treatment or that there is a systemic problem of the way black people
(4:38:04) treat white people that's that's not like there is there is a already like connotation it's like I don't what's the
(4:38:10) right word what's the way you put it there the the statement I hate black people i don't I don't really want to say that on the podcast clip it clip
(4:38:17) clip there we go there we go i'm sure it'll be um that statement has already had a meaning ascribed to it people
(4:38:23) already have a connotation it's like a similar thing of like people who like take the swastika canal and fly it and want to be like no it just means a
(4:38:29) symbol of peace in my religion and it's like well no that statement has already been so tainted by this previous meaning
(4:38:35) that it it can't mean something else because of how common it is the phrase I hate men has never been accompanied by
(4:38:41) the systemic extermination of men it's never been accompanied by the systemic subjugation of men it's never been been
(4:38:47) accompanied by any actual like tangible harm against men you don't think there's
(4:38:52) any harm i think there is harm in I think there is harm in the case that
(4:38:57) like maybe it's not the most effective thing because it does turn men off and I'm not like turn men away from the movement and I'm not trying to make a
(4:39:03) claim that like that's the way that women ought to do it do you think it would cause transgender people harm if
(4:39:09) they if somebody said uh like I hate trans people or uh kill all tea people
(4:39:15) do you think that would cause harm yeah but are tea people like offing like what I don't are tea people offing cis people
(4:39:23) it's the other way around i don't see how but what do you what's the mean like what's the that's already a thing it's
(4:39:28) like transphobia and like the hatred of like trans people is already a a prominent Yeah we also have a word
(4:39:33) called sexism and that would also apply to men sorry I'm the moderate actually no no it's fine it's post no well I think what
(4:39:41) what Brian was pointing to is like if you're if it's fine to uh extrapolate or
(4:39:47) generalize based on certain experiences and it's understandable he's just taking another group and from those experience
(4:39:55) or say statistics or something that why would it be wrong to statistics statistics wouldn't back up white people
(4:40:01) being afraid of statistics wouldn't back up white people being afraid of black people because majority of violence is intraracial so intraracial 90% of black
(4:40:10) people are killed this is often killed by other black people 85% of white people are killed by other white people
(4:40:15) why would that preclude a white person being fearful or scared of a racial minority what do you mean because
(4:40:21) they've had like a singular instance or a bad instance isn't it the case that like the comparative rate so if you look
(4:40:26) at like Asian on black versus black on Asian crime there is there's disparity but it's still drastically low if if
(4:40:33) you're talking about who is an Asian mo like overwhelmingly more likely to be um like hurt by it it is someone of their
(4:40:39) own race because people live almost entirely around domestic violence but like stranger danger like on the street
(4:40:45) violence well you who do you usually live around you're not usually just randomly going into communities that you
(4:40:50) don't inhabit or like like white people live around and work primarily around
(4:40:55) white people and so you're saying like if I go into a neighborhood where there's a high rate of black-on-black
(4:41:01) crime that I should be more I shouldn't be worried
(4:41:06) about I think you should be worried but just cuz it has a high rate of crime like on a I mean I don't know I think
(4:41:11) that I think a lot of this stuff like I just I don't I'm not denying that like I understand where the sentiment that
(4:41:17) you're expressing comes from Brian like I I get that like it's like like look we should oppose generalizations of any
(4:41:22) group on any basis because it's just you know it's wrong and I think there's a claim to be wait why is that wrong i
(4:41:30) mean you would say it's I wouldn't say making determinations but generalizations general generalization
(4:41:35) saying all all blank or blank but like Oh blank oh like Yeah except for you all
(4:41:41) women should be in the home but Well I guess they could be okay i guess uh just one question on the bear thing then um
() 
(4:41:50) you would say if somebody picks the bear over men that would not be like sexist
(4:41:56) no you understand why a woman would pick I mean sure my question is let's say if
(4:42:02) we kind of and would you say that comes down to safety i mean factually yeah right women pick bear because they are
(4:42:10) afraid that the man might essay them and kill them or whatever it is whereas the bear might just kill them or not but
(4:42:16) they're not going to like essay them right so it's like a safety assessment it comes down to safety but so if
(4:42:22) somebody for example if the question changes and the question becomes would you rather come across a random black
(4:42:28) person or a random bear in the woods and they pick bear over black person would you say they're a racist
(4:42:34) well it would depend who are they afraid of in the woods who is committing it wouldn't matter if it was a black woman
(4:42:40) or a black man they'd still pick the bear i think No wait a second i think it's weird though because like How's it
(4:42:45) weird because black women aren't committing like massive rates of violence or crime i'm not going to deny
(4:42:52) the majority of men aren't like it's a very small Sure i would agree if we look at the overwhelming majority yeah right
(4:42:59) but you're saying black women are uh immune to committing violent crime not immune they're much less likely i'll
(4:43:06) even grant it but this person we would have to we would have to math it out we have to mask it out well who cares if
(4:43:12) that Well I mean wouldn't the math in the original example when it's a uh a woman preferring the bear over the man i
(4:43:18) think the math even in that because you're only assume you're only including killing you're only including being killed i would include essay in that you
(4:43:24) think a bear is more likely to sex no that's No no that's not what I'm saying that's not what I'm saying at all but
(4:43:30) here but that's what women are is it Would it be racist to pick the bear over
(4:43:35) the black person yes I will this is not a contradiction whatsoever at all if it
(4:43:40) is wait a second wait a second wait a second if it was would you rather pick a bear or like a black man yeah pick pick
(4:43:47) the bear that's fine because it's the man that's doing the operative work there it's the man that's doing like I
(4:43:53) don't like I don't I think black women largely should be more like afraid of
(4:43:58) like in terms of the male thing black men and white women should be afraid of white men because that's the people who are most likely to harm them but in this
(4:44:05) black scenario it's not just it's not the the real like there's just no lived reality of like white people a majority
(4:44:14) of white people like being victims of like terrible awful crimes at the hands of black people or black women i mean
(4:44:21) there's it would be lar it would be largely black men i mean there's that guy at the track meet who just got stabbed but I mean we don't know the
(4:44:27) details of that and we talk about that are we talking about that said hold on but you said there there's this group of people doesn't have the lived experience
(4:44:34) of being victims of Hold on there's crime perpetuated by black people are you saying black people don't commit
(4:44:40) crimes i'm not saying they don't commit crimes i'm saying that black people committing crimes against white people is not a pervasive issue it's not it's
(4:44:47) not pervasive it just doesn't it's not a majority an overwhelming majority you can look at the statistics and I already
(4:44:53) said it was it's over it's intraracial even then if you're going to say that if
(4:44:58) they pick the bear over the black person that must be racist then surely black man no just do not well the the question
(4:45:05) that I posed was not black man it was just black person so it could be a woman it could be a man now the is it is it
(4:45:13) racist but then for you to say well it wouldn't be sexist to pick the bear over the man i just I not really following
(4:45:19) yeah it's like he's just all he's doing is swapping out the choices and if it's if it's sexist in one instance but it's
(4:45:27) not but it's or let's say it's racist but it's not sexist he's saying like why is it racist you should be consistent i
(4:45:34) don't but I don't think there's an inconsistency here because it's not like and I see this a lot like why can't white people fear black people if men if
(4:45:41) women can fear men and I I don't think that there's a I don't think that I don't think the parallel holds because
(4:45:47) the the demographic committing violence regardless of race is men so if you're
(4:45:53) afraid of black men over white men it's you're not you're not more likely as as
(4:45:59) a I don't if if you want to if let's say you oppose this as like a as like a would you as to like a black woman like
(4:46:05) would you rather encounter a bear or like a black person in the woods i mean then maybe she would be like "Yeah I want the bear because it might be a
(4:46:10) black man." And because men within a society are more likely regardless of race to be Why can't Why can't you make
(4:46:18) a subcategory okay we've established men but then why can't we just make a subcategory to say like okay there's
(4:46:24) groups between a white man and a and a black man who would you rather find be in the woods with if you're if you're a
(4:46:30) white man you would or if you're a if you're a white woman it's more likely that you are to be it doesn't really m
(4:46:36) it's just a man it's just men in general are more likely to assault it's not it's not only like a a racial demographic
(4:46:43) thing it's just that then there's no basis for that like I don't there is a basis for women fearing men that that
(4:46:49) makes sense but it's not like like there's nothing about a black man that makes like like him more scary than a
(4:46:55) white man other than if you think black people are scary and I don't know if this was what you were asking Jim Bob but what if the question shifts to this
(4:47:02) uh a white woman in the woods and she's given an option of spawning in she either comes across a random white
(4:47:09) person or excuse me a random white man versus a random black man and she picks
(4:47:14) the white man is that racist no I don't you don't think it's racist i don't I
(4:47:19) don't know i don't But I thought Hold on but didn't you just say that the rates of like interracial violence are it's
(4:47:25) like within your same race it's higher right it's it's going to happen if there's a man there it's But you said
(4:47:32) because when I gave you the Asian example you're like "Well okay the rates of Asian on Asian crime sure are higher
(4:47:38) i I feel like we've extracted this hypothetical so far that it just doesn't track reality anymore like I just don't think it's I I don't I don't think it is
(4:47:44) right i don't think it is at all well then we didn't even get into like per capita like the percent of crime and
(4:47:49) convictions versus white and black if there's not an argument there's not I'm not saying that like black people don't
(4:47:55) commit a disproportionate rate of crime that's not the claim i would make an argument that that largely stems from socioeconomic factors and historical
(4:48:02) factors that have you know impoverished a community for you know generations upon generations and leads to a gang
(4:48:07) culture emerging that we've seen over and over and over again throughout history even among white individuals when they came to this country so I I
(4:48:13) don't know i just I don't Well I'll just I guess I can only reframe it one way so
(4:48:18) the woman who picks the bear over the man the reason she does this is she had
(4:48:25) uh let's say two to three poor experiences with uh and all the women around her have similar experiences too
(4:48:31) sure and and she's also consuming content on Tik Tok in the algorithm and she's seeing news stories about the
(4:48:37) incident of violence against uh women and she goes to university and there's like a freshman orientation tutorial
(4:48:44) where they're like "Okay the grape rate is like half or something or whatever whatever they perpetuate." And then you
(4:48:51) have a white per you have a white person who they're asked the bear or black person question and they've had two or
(4:48:59) three negative uh encounters with black people maybe one of them will PTSD
(4:49:05) response fine like I don't you know fine that's fair I don't like I don't if that person in this in this hypothetical if
(4:49:11) they want to ch if they want to choose to not be around a black person also in your little the little story you said um
(4:49:17) you said there's this there's this narrative that needs to corrected over and over again where it's like there's this big story about poverty and then
(4:49:24) the poverty justifies the crime it's actually the case that crime causes more poverty than poverty causes crime well
(4:49:32) sure it's a cycle i was disagreeing with you right but the narrative is always they it's always said in this way where
(4:49:38) it's like oh they're in a they're in a terrible whoever it is they're in a terrible position they did what they did
(4:49:44) it causes crime and then it's a cycle of poverty but it's there there are people who don't commit crime who are in
(4:49:50) poverty there's also rich people who commit crime so I'm not sure what the cycle is actually blamed on i think
(4:49:56) there's a cultural aspect when we look at uh crime or even any degenerate behavior um itself that um there's even
(4:50:05) legal things that aren't crime that I consider degenerate but um it's all plays into it but I don't think that uh
(4:50:12) there's this like narrative where it's like certain groups of people it's not their fault that they're behaving the
(4:50:18) way they're doing i'm not I'm not trying to remove individual responsibility here i'm you know absolutely I don't like I think that it is also true that majority
(4:50:25) of people who are subjected to bad conditions don't perpetuate those bad conditions so that is true however it is
(4:50:31) true that statistically they are more likely to um in general so that's kind of the old the only claim claim that I'm
