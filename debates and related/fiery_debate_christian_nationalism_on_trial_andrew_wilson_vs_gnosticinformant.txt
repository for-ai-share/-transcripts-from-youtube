(3:38) it these are approximately five minute opening statements nastic inant the floor is all yours wait a second James
(3:44) just very quickly um I'm concerned ban woo may have touched one of these water bottles can I have a different bottle of
(3:53) water we'll work on that okay thank you now sticking forward the floor is all yours all right so
(4:00) I uh I'm a last last minute fill in um the other one I was at least I had some
(4:06) weeks to prepare from yester this one was like two days ago I found out that I was going to fill in for this one so I
(4:11) got a few notes put together in the last hour or so but I think we're going to do good I think the back and forth will be
(4:17) good so Classical liberalism in my opinion has been so
(4:22) effective for society that that's the reason why so many countries have followed suit after
(4:29) obviously the French and American Revolution and then it just completely took over the world basically most
(4:37) modern countries have some sort of constitution some sort of uh list of
(4:42) civil rights that are protected by the state and it's led to the thriving of
(4:51) different areas not just science but uh the Arts I mean I was in Egypt and they
(4:59) do have Lo local music there but I couldn't believe how much I was hearing American music there we had we're
(5:07) dominating in uh in media and and and film and and music because we live in a
(5:15) society where people are free to express themselves and put out that type of uh
(5:20) literature or film or whatever it is that other places don't really have the
(5:26) ability to do and so the the reason is is because when in
(5:32) order to have scientific advancements you have to have a environment where there is no Dogma
(5:38) putting pressure on people where there isn't a a state controlled theocracy if you
(5:46) will which is what Christian nationalism is theocracy that is getting in the way
(5:51) of people doing things that are you know exploring areas that are considered to
(5:57) be uh Blasphemous or or whatnot and so
(6:04) Classical liberalism also offers people who are religious to be religious so it
(6:09) sort of covers the other end too I don't know if you ever heard of rajn spum it
(6:14) was like this cult out in Oregon a bunch of new age bunch of new age weirdos out
(6:20) there I think it was like in the 80s or 90s they had their own commune it was a disaster don't get me wrong I'm not like
(6:26) saying this was a good thing is that the people [ __ ] guy I I know I was that Usha was that yeah OSHA the point is
(6:33) they had the ability to do that in under this constitution they had the ability to go and build their own community
(6:41) and and have you can have homeschool no nobody's stopping you from homeschooling and setting up your own community of of
(6:47) a church um in fact During the bulvik Revolution we had floods of refugees
(6:54) from Russia that came here because this was the best place to go that they could
(6:59) fre set up their church and started a Orthodox community in
(7:04) America so Classical liberalism doesn't just give atheism to people it gives
(7:09) them the choice to choose a religion um do we do have one example
(7:17) still around today of what could be considered Christian nationalist nation
(7:24) and that's Armenia I'm interested to hear what he thinks about this because Armenia
(7:30) has a state religion the government is um pretty much tied to this state Rel
(7:39) the church The Armenian Church Orthodox church but they also score on the CPI
(7:45) corruption's perception index 47 out of 100 which is
(7:51) 62nd worst out of 180 behind sa behind Saudi Arabia and
(7:57) behind Costa Rica just in front of Jordan and Kuwait so they're sitting
(8:03) right with their buddies that are all theocracies and then at the top 20 you have all of the classical liberal
(8:10) Nations Denmark number one with a 90 score Finland number two with 87 United
(8:15) States I don't think anyone here disagrees there's some corruption in the United States but we're still in I think 20 or 21 with a score of 69 well above
(8:25) Armenia and then there's other areas other nations that aren't necessarily Christian nationalists they do actually
(8:32) have um constitutions but are majority Christian as far as the culture goes
(8:38) like Argentina and Costa Rica or Brazil where you know Rio Rio de
(8:44) Janeiro with the giant Jesus is just staring over sitting over the whole city and these are places where poverty and
(8:51) unemployment and lack of Labor violent crime drugs CRI um gangs are just
(8:59) rampant so Christian culture isn't really doing much about that
(9:07) um and I and so you know I was thinking since I'm you're the one on trial here I
(9:13) just wanted to ask you how would you enforce this how would this even go about when we already have a
(9:20) mostly I mean even people who don't consider themselves liberal whether you're libertarian or center right would
(9:27) probably align bet more with con tion Republic ideals than Christian nationalism I mean I don't know what I I
(9:34) I don't even know what the percentage might be I would probably say 90% of the country would align with what I'm saying
(9:40) right now not this room for sure though but that's okay um how would you enforce
(9:47) that what and also what's which Christian denomination obviously you're Orthodox so what about
(9:54) Protestants who I was I was at a Protestant church for six years
(9:59) okay uh who said the Catholics were all going to hell and so are the Orthodoxy how do you what about them that's that's
(10:06) it we'll kick it over to Andrew for his five minute opening statement as well Andrew the floor is all yours well first
(10:12) and foremost uh thank you to The Crucible crew for uh drinking way too much with me last night I'm
(10:20) trying trying trying to to uh to hair the dog here a little bit and get through this debate with my dignity
(10:26) intact um it's so to kind of uh dive into a few of these
(10:32) things Christian nationalism if you wanted to give a broad definition I think this one would be fine uh it's a
(10:37) form of religious nationalism focuses on promoting the Christian views of its followers in order to achieve prominence
(10:42) or dominance in political and social life so often the criticism that you'll hear from your opponents when you're
(10:48) talking about Christian nationalism is about enforcement how do we enforce this are we going to imprison the gays right
(10:55) and that always comes down to imprisoning gay people for some reason um are we GNA oppress the women are they
(11:00) not going to be allowed to vote which even though I prefer probably most of them didn't um no it's about prominence
(11:06) and culture so what we're what the ideal of Christian nationalism is is the the idea of Christianity being The prominent
(11:12) force in the social order of culture doesn't have much to do with law I think
(11:18) that laws will be just and justly created when the morality of the people who are making them have a Christian
(11:25) foundation and a Christian ethic so that's what it's promoting it's not promoting a takeover of all lawmaking
(11:32) systems that's in many ways unimportant we're talking about the found foundational ethics of the lawmaker
(11:38) themselves so if the foundation ethics of the lawmaker prominently work around this ethical system the theory anyway is
(11:46) that it should create a more ethical Society right doesn't mean that you couldn't make laws which uh were good
(11:52) for secularist or that secularist would need to be tortured with Chinese water torture except maybe Neil um all it
(11:59) means is that it's the promotion of the prominence of Christianity as a cultural force that our voices also get to be
(12:06) heard and if our voices end up coming out on top good good why is it everybody
(12:12) else's uh theories and ideas get to come out on top except for Christian ideas and theories and that's what we're
(12:19) really pushing for that's what Christian nationalists are actually pushing for so Neil he makes and this uh debate the
(12:26) reason I wanted to do it is because I'm often attacked for uh always being on the
(12:32) attack always hitting which is true uh but I'm actually happy to be on the side that's getting grilled to answer these
(12:38) questions because so many people have them uh Classical liberalism he says good for society because of arts and
(12:44) media and a few things like that but Neil forgets there's a double-edged sword that without that foundational ethical system media has turned into a
(12:51) promotion for Mass degeneracy which hasn't been helpful for anybody massive promotion of degeneracy
(12:57) in most Hollywood films massive promotion of degeneracy uh which is coming out of most forms of media now
(13:04) how how would Neil compensate for that well he can't because if you have these kind of unlimited freedoms of expression
(13:11) you're going to have to have a moral population or else you're going to end up with degeneracy how are you going to
(13:16) instill those morals in the population with secularism like Neils he can't uh
(13:21) Society where freedom to express as important Christian ethics doesn't say that you can't express yourself where is
(13:27) that happening nowhere he says scientific advancement requires no Dogma I would argue it kind of is a
(13:33) Dogma but uh science is evolving now into sociology and psychology being a
(13:40) dominant cultural Force so the thing is is like is psychology and sociology even
(13:45) science I don't even think it is I don't even consider psychology to be a form of
(13:50) legitimate science but that is what is becoming the dominant force in culture
(13:56) not real science it's not like people who are building rocket ships are getting beat up by Christians they're
(14:02) not like oh no we no more rocket ships they're what they're saying is no more sociological studies which say that we
(14:08) can rearrange kids uh genders and rearrange their autonomy and their Anatomy right that's what they're
(14:15) saying uh he's he brought up the Oregon commune which is funny this was under a
(14:20) a lunatic named OSHA but here's what's so funny about it because of the
(14:25) weakness of the laws in in the United States for these kinds of fre these people were actually able to take over
(14:31) this entire town put in their own police force right and turn it into a hell hole where they ended up all getting arrested
(14:37) because they were trying to poison the local population right that great job there
(14:43) Neil right great job there uh he says well what about these areas that have
(14:50) Christian ethics or they have Christian nationalism like Armenia where corruption is really high corrupt
(14:56) Christian ethics themselves are designed to reduce corruption that's true but pointing out a place where uh it is
(15:03) corrupt and um and Christianity happens to be the dominant Force for the religion doesn't mean that it's
(15:09) Christianity causing the corruption 15 seconds so and then lastly uh well we can get into it from there anyway Neil
(15:16) I'm happy to open this up whenever you're ready thank you very much gentlemen floor is yours oh is there a
(15:21) rebuttal thing too or open dialogue all right let me just ask you something let me just robot one thing you said the
(15:26) about the the commune of the people I brought them up and I did say it turned into a disaster but they broke
(15:33) the law so the law is still there the ideal the idea of someone lawfully
(15:40) starting their own commune is possible is what I meant yeah I know but but listen they broke that's a terrible
(15:46) example they broke the law later they broke the law later when they were trying to poison everyone but they actually work within the confines of the
(15:51) law take the entire town over take over the entire police department and literally begin the enforcement of their
(15:57) cult in in because they didn't share the same value structures or virtues as the
(16:03) local population right but you and your entire community of Orthodoxy could do
(16:09) the same thing and then not break the law and then live in your ideal situation that you're looking to do
(16:15) anyway what which is what Orthodoxy raising your children under Orthodoxy
(16:21) having having a church that right you know having people around you who have the same ideas as you yeah but what what did I say that Christian that Christian
(16:27) nationalism is it's the movement towards Christianity becoming a prominent social
(16:32) Force social Force for good so the idea here is social force not necessarily
(16:38) taking over government positions though there's going to be an entailment I don't think you're worried about degeneracy well not just de degeneracy
(16:45) but that's a big part of it when you look at uh government structure now I don't think church and state can be
(16:51) completely separated because people are informed by their religious values when they're in office AG so they're going to
(16:57) rule and govern based on those values so they can't be completely separated we have 60 86 Christians in the Senate
(17:06) right now yep and I I mean most of them are Christians so you would think yeah
(17:11) kind of weak a lot of them are pretty weak Christians and that's what I'm that's what I'm trying that's another question I have for you most people are
(17:17) weak Christians I mean I agree how do you get that's how we know that Christianity is not the dominant
(17:23) social forces how do you get people to think the way you think without like like extremely harsh
(17:29) law why would we need extremely harsh law people does it seem like I'm having trouble convincing people to think like
(17:34) I think that the truth is is that that's a good point is that just through debate just through debate dialogue right and
(17:42) uh the differences and clashes of ideas it's very easy for me to promote that
(17:47) Christians should be the dominant force of culture well here's what what are Christians promising to do bad to you oh
(17:53) we're going to eliminate we're going to eliminate pornography we're going to eliminate only fans we're going to promote nuclear family we're going to
(17:59) try to bring the birth rate back up what is it we're trying to do here to you what is it that Christians are trying to
(18:04) do that's so bad to you guys so you know I think obviously the States play into
(18:09) this Florida passed uh a bill where you can't log into porn websites unless you
(18:15) have ID I think it's good I'm not I'm saying the law can work for your favor
(18:20) sure and I'm and and also on top of that you just saw the last election completely sweep in your in your favor
(18:27) so classical liberal ISM can be a good thing you can have bad ideas win out but
(18:32) then people get tired of those bad ideas or they realize I was wrong and they vote the other way can Christianity exist in any system communism it can
(18:40) exist there it has it can it's not that it's optimal but it can it can exist in capitalism it can exist in Classical
(18:46) liberalism it can exist in libertarianism the structure of the religion itself is a social Force
(18:52) necessarily that is going to start conditioning laws that's true but the types of laws that you're talking about were uh that pushing are what the
(19:00) reduction of degeneracy the the biggest Force the reason Christianity is making such a social comeback and why Christian
(19:07) nationalism will win you can look at the odds markets even on this the it's Christian nationalism is winning because
(19:15) of the backlash towards degeneracy which Classical liberalism allows through art and culture other than this room where
(19:21) is Christian nationalism winning what I didn't you just give didn't you just give an entire case for Christian
(19:26) nationalism sweeping the entire off uh uh government Christians not
(19:31) nationalists though so I'm I'm not saying that there's a difference between Christian nationalism and then just having a bunch of what's the difference
(19:38) that they're not enforcing like they're not enforcing laws that are ex the one that they just passed in Florida well
(19:44) that's fine yeah that's not Christian is that your idea of Christian no I think that you you brought it up as an example
(19:50) of how Christian social force can lead to law so that would be part of Christian of of Christian nationalism
(19:55) sure but that's also what the point of a republic the Democratic Republic is is that you have representatives in there
(20:01) who have different ideas 86 of them being Christian and they are going to be why do we need guys in there who have
(20:07) the idea that we need to legalize Point that's not Christian nationalism that's just that's just Republican Democratic Republic
(20:13) working yeah just happen to working in your favor at this point yeah yeah so great but what is Christian nationalism
(20:19) it's the idea of promoting the social Force towards the ideas of Christian ethics it's not necessarily the idea of
(20:26) taking over government that's just an intent once people become ethical they move towards Christian ethics take over
(20:31) government anyway so it's really just Christian populism is that probably a better term yeah that's a term that I
(20:36) often interchange with Christian nationalism is Christian populism it's the idea of the social force of
(20:42) Christianity being the dominant Force for culture period And so like I the question I was
(20:48) asking where do you go into like okay Church State let's go there you said the church should have
(20:55) dictation over certain areas like what like marriage marriage okay and what
(21:00) happens when Buddhists want to get married they don't get married what if
(21:06) they want to they can go uh to a Buddhist nation and get married what do you mean I'm kidding I'm kidding
(21:12) relax um if it comes to secular marriage things like this if Buddhists want to
(21:18) get married if we keep the state out of it then who cares why why marriage though marriage was never just a thing
(21:24) for Christians though yeah but what is it it's not going to still be a thing just for
(21:29) Christians okay so why does the state need to be involved in marri still get the benefits of being married without having a religious what are the benefits
(21:35) of being no I'm saying you can take this the state completely out of
(21:40) marriage why why does the state need to be involved in marriage because you know some one person makes a bunch of money
(21:45) the other person doesn't and then there's you know there's all these weird there's all these laws on what happens
(21:52) when they divorce all that stuff yeah so so the state needs to come in and govern your personal life huh that's what
(21:57) you're saying no no that's but you're you I asked you why the state needs to be involved in marriage and you said
(22:04) because of money because one person could make more money than the other person or some nonsense well there's like tax benefits all types of benefits
(22:10) for people getting married that's just part you know obviously yeah you can literally just reform the tax laws that
(22:16) takes care of that I don't even have a problem with that but why does the state but isn't that way let's say that we took the state out of marriage Al
(22:22) together okay and now churches have the authority over who they're going to marry or not you a secularist and
(22:28) atheist what's to stop you from just declaring you're married I'm married right but then there's no there's no tax benefits you don't get anything there's
(22:34) there's there's not really much in the way of tax benefits now and the earned income child credit you get it whether
(22:39) you're married or not so like what are you really taking away from people I'm that's all I'm really saying is that the
(22:44) benefits of why people get married is that's what people that's nobody gets married for a [ __ ] tax break dude I I
(22:52) would bet could you even imagine that hey baby I can't wait to marry you I thinking that uh I'd save a couple
(22:57) thousand on my income taxes this year last thing on the marriage thing CU this is dumb I don't know if you want to keep
(23:04) going on this but what's the difference between getting married in your preferred church and then not and then
(23:11) someone else doing it somewhere else what do you say well so right now there's someone goes to Vegas and get
(23:17) married what's yeah right now there's a forcible recognition as to what marriage is I think if the state is out of
(23:23) marriage that uh the social order of Christians the force the force of that order we would recognize proper
(23:29) marriages which would lead to social shame for the types of marriages we don't like without ever needing to use
(23:34) the prescription or power of law for dis discrimination okay what else would the
(23:40) church do have powers in as far as right now you have your three branches of government where where is the church
(23:45) going to play into this what do you mean they would just apply in a synergistic relationship okay what's the logistics
(23:52) of that of a synergistic relationship yeah it just means that they have power over culture and culture has power of
(23:58) the dominance of governance that there's a lot like what's the degree of that that's the
(24:04) that's very to me that's very vague like what are they going to be able to stop a movie from coming out that it's de they
(24:10) could through social pressures yes but they can do that now through social pressures right so social pressures is
(24:15) something that anyone could do but I'm say that's right what can the church do as far as can apply social pressures
(24:21) just like anybody else could to stop a movie from coming out why do you need the why do you need theocracy for that then who's who the [ __ ] advocated for
(24:27) the I'm sorry Christian Christian nationalism then because what is Christian nationalism what is Christian
(24:32) nationalism it's the movement towards Christianity being the dominant social force in society okay so if the idea
(24:39) here is that Christians are are getting rid of things like abortion smut movies things like this they can do that
(24:45) through Social Power it's just the realization that Christians have the social power to do it like let me give you an example you remember you remember
(24:51) during covid-19 that almost every place shut down they told them to shut down except what churches they went no we're
(24:58) not yeah that created actually a huge social push back that no nobody else was
(25:04) defying the government except the church except churches right who said no we're not doing it we're not going to do this
(25:10) no way not going to happen that created a social Dynamic of kind of fighting back you know what I mean it's the first
(25:16) time people had seen in a long time where churches were able to socially hit back and so that created a kind of
(25:23) dominant force or or some some sort of inertia towards something so what we're looking to to do is create that same
(25:30) social force in society towards what it is that we want necessarily thinking that will at some point inform laws but
(25:36) we don't have to change the entire process I postulate the entire process will change over time anyway a if the
(25:43) social Foundation is predominantly Christian
(25:49) um my other question
(25:54) was like okay the the eracy thing you really
(26:00) thought he had some of that theocracy I care about freedom of expression I'm not pro degeneracy but I know there's levels
(26:06) of what people consider degeneracy and what some people have higher tolerances for things yeah I'm trying is it
(26:12) perfectly acceptable for you inside of this kind of government theory that you have in your head if Christians as a as
(26:22) individuals use the force of social shame and the force of kind of where we
(26:28) put our money things like this in order to uh stop companies from releasing
(26:34) products we don't like to stop companies uh from doing things we don't like even to stop governments from passing laws we
(26:41) don't like is is there any actual objection to that through through the
(26:46) system right now no no so like I don't have any issues with but but Christianity agree with the politics
(26:53) yeah the the last election is the last election people voted and that's that's what it is sure but that's that's the
(26:58) that's Democratic Republic that's the uh yeah that's just the structure of government but I like I said
(27:04) Christianity can exist in any type of government structure yeah what I'm saying to you is that that doesn't mean
(27:10) it gets to be the predominant social force and it's not right now if if Christianity was truly the the the
(27:16) dominant social force in society porn wouldn't exist right it wouldn't exist
(27:21) we would have laws against it we would we would have laws against transgender
(27:27) uh you know doing reassignment surgery for kids we'd have laws against these things but it's not just Christianity
(27:32) that has ethical um dispositions against porn for
(27:38) example other other faiths do the same thing can't wait for them to join us in our in our fight for social supremacy of
(27:48) Christianity great so what's the difference between what's going on right now and then just people are becoming
(27:55) Christian what do you mean like what's the difference between what what you're saying and because right now
(28:01) Christianity is not the dominant social force of the United States the aim of no and the aim of Christian nationalism is
(28:07) to make it so my evidence is I thought you said it was just realizing that they have the power no what do you mean
(28:13) realizing they have the power I thought you just said it's them realizing that they actually do have the power because
(28:18) they're the most dominant group in no that's not what I said yeah I think you were talking about when I was talking
(28:24) about churches themselves realizing they had power to fight back against yeah
(28:30) that which was a thing where people realize wait the church so when you when you talk about institutional power in
(28:35) the United States the left Wings institutional Powers through media right I don't think we would disagree there
(28:41) right it has been through through media for the last 60 years and uh through the various tech companies until recently
(28:48) that's been a a huge source of their power too for propag intoa this and that the all the right really has is just you
(28:55) know the largest institution we could have which is church is but for a long time they've been very silent on
(29:00) political issues haven't really pushed too hard on them except for maybe abortion what Christian nationalism is
(29:06) proposing is that the social order inside of society be shaken up where Christians become the dominant force and
(29:11) stay that way for social cohesion adherence and then eventually policy
(29:17) shaping will be in the image of those ethics it's not a radical overhaul it's
(29:22) not a it's not necessary for there to be a radical overhaul of the C current laws
(29:27) and reg ulations because if people follow those ethics and their constituents follow those ethics those
(29:33) things will be demanded anyway and what happens when different denominations and when the Protestants start arguing with
(29:40) the Catholics and the Catholics start arguing with the pro or the Orthodoxy what happens then what happens then is
(29:46) that we have theological differences and then we start arguing about which which one becomes the social Force which has
(29:52) always happened but the kind of uniform ethics of those who believe in the night
(29:58) an Creed right they don't change not kind of the universal grounding we're going to agree on a lot more than we
(30:03) disagree about yes we'll fight over theology that's true but atheists fight over all sorts of different things when
(30:09) it comes to science and harm principles and stuff like this it seems to still be okay they can still unite over some
(30:15) issues and it seems to be all right for them and I this is just kind of a joke but the Methodist types that are you
(30:22) know that obviously you're not a fan of yeah uh what about them what about them what are they they're Christians right
(30:28) what do they do they have a a say in your Christian National as far as a
(30:33) dominant force in society I still think that even Protestants even Protestants
(30:39) bring more value to the table than secularist and atheist and and people
(30:45) like this now yes I agree with you talking about some Protestants are problematic that's true okay and you have some Churches which have the lgbtq
(30:52) stuff it's disgusting this type of thing right right but if you were to have Christianity become again a prominent
(30:58) social force in society those things would begin to be be Whitted away they're already fought and resisted at
(31:04) every single metric at least within within I mean
(31:09) most Christians for instance if you have an lgbtq flag in your church they don't consider you a Christian I mean they're
(31:15) just going to walk away from that right I guess the thing I'm hung up on right now is what we just saw in the last
(31:20) election yeah was people coming out to vote mostly the Christian right and
(31:27) winning in every single all winning all the swing States winning the house winning the Senate what is wrong with
(31:35) this how is that not working that needs like that seems to it is working so what so what do you need
(31:41) Christian nationalism for because we here's the the reason it worked is because Christian nationalists like me
(31:46) were pushing Christian ethics to be the the dominant social form in society by pointing out that hey these Progressive
(31:53) values the things that these progressives want to do and this mass degeneracy is not working well for society and so it was through tens of
(32:00) thousands of men like me even to some degree like you Neil who were saying look enough of this is enough of this
(32:07) right mostly pushed by Christians though mostly pushed by Christians enough of the SMUD enough of the degeneracy that
(32:14) really helped uh sweep Trump in why do you think order one day one was there's only two genders right signed into law
(32:21) there's only two do you think that that was Trump's idea or do you think that that was the fact that um his advisers
(32:27) went look you're Christian Base they've been fighting for this for a long time and it's time for you to put this in
(32:33) place yeah I think it's I think it could be that yeah yeah that is the idea of
(32:39) Christian nationalism Christianity as a social force can have serious uh political
(32:44) ramifications and ultimately if we're the social dominant power we can get rid of a lot of this stuff that's causing
(32:50) problems in society and for and and passing laws is one of the ways right like can you give
(32:56) me an example of a law that you would enforce that gets rid of degeneracy sure I would I absolutely ask them to or or
(33:04) want to push towards the overturning of the interpretation that gay marriage is
(33:10) um is a thing that's not up to the states so I think that that should can be completely left up to the states like
(33:15) it was and that state should have actual voting done on whether or not
(33:20) homosexuals should be allowed to get married and then when that happens guess what they never are like even California
(33:26) failed right really yeah even in California it failed so when it's left up to the
(33:32) states to actually vote on these things and the people in the states vote they say no right now under the propaganda
(33:38) they say oh people are so accepting of lgbtq it's like well how come when it comes to time for the people to vote
(33:43) then they don't vote for it they don't want it it's because it's all propaganda so Christianity as a social force can do
(33:51) a lot to dominate these areas of propaganda and do a lot to push forward social issues that we find valuable
(33:57) that's what postulating dominant social force one of the things I brought up
(34:03) when I opened up was this the how important it is for
(34:09) universities to be free from any sort of dogma of any sort of ideology whether
(34:14) it's some politics or religion or whatever to and be able to make to do
(34:21) studies on things and make breakthroughs or whatever um I didn't really hear anything about that from you like what
(34:27) do you you I think that psychology has become very dogmatic not just talking about psychology yeah but I think that
(34:33) the dominant social force of Science in uh the West is psychology and sociology
(34:39) I think that that is the dominant social Force when people say you don't believe in science they mean my studies you
(34:44) don't believe in must studies you don't believe that uh you know studies show that due to gray matter in the back rear
(34:51) of the Abdullah ablang you kid could be trans right this is the idea of modern
(34:57) sociology in Psychology which I consider to be pseudoscientific and an extension
(35:02) of progressive uh it's it's like an extension of the power arm of
(35:07) progressives is to use pseudo science package it as though it's real science
(35:13) and then put it out as propaganda right studies show XYZ most studies are not even
(35:21) reproducible because they pseudo science so it's like no science itself has now become corrupted because what's passing
(35:27) for science sence is in science let me ask you this nice nice you got a clap
(35:32) out of that let me ask you this what would you prefer you didn't get a clap yeah that was you that was you uh would
(35:37) you what would you personally prefer I'm curious would you prefer this constitutional republic like right have
(35:43) right now or for example like the Byzantine Roman Christian state where there's an emperor and a patriarch and
(35:51) they can kind of control everything what would you prefer you or yourself oh for my personal preferences which well I
(35:57) would prefer uh to to stay under a constitutional republic for now yeah for now I think
(36:02) that that's what would work yes interesting because that would be a
(36:07) completely a Christian nationalist system in my opinion and the reason why I brought that up is because I just
(36:13) don't think it could work right now in modernity yeah right me neither yeah yeah I don't think it could work right
(36:18) now in modernity that doesn't mean that there's not going to be a time for it because I think there will but that takes societal conditioning like serious
(36:27) long longterm conditioning Christian nationalists are postulating a 300-year plan just like the great churches which
(36:33) were built in the past that took hundreds of years this is going to be a fight that takes hundreds of years it's
(36:38) not going to be what's the end game of that 300 year plan I'd love to hear that the what's the end game of Science of
(36:45) your scient AME of science there's no such thing as end game for S so here's my end game here's my endgame for you
(36:50) same as your end game for me the whole world becomes Christian that's the end game has it ever been that way well I
(36:57) don't know I don't think so no now now I want I don't want to get too much into
(37:04) like Theology and stuff but I more clapping by the way I got more clapping yeah that was good you got you got you got the crowd right now so that's cool
(37:10) you know some of the stuff in like Paul talks about the rulers of this age um you know there's
(37:18) the the rulers of this age are going to be swept away by the powers from heaven
(37:24) and Jesus getting getting the point of Caesar on it and he's asked like what
(37:30) about this image of Caesar basically he says give to Caesar what is Caesar's give to God is what is God's there was
(37:36) this there was this idea in the gospels and in Paul's Epistles that this world
(37:43) is is evil it's going to do what it does carry your cross be a Christian
(37:49) despite what's around you yeah but I'm seeing from you that forget about that
(37:54) we need power I see a more Nan approach we should be in power we should be controlling uh
(38:01) culture well no it's not a n look at the it's it's neither it's not a nian
(38:07) approach or I'm not saying I'm just saying when you say when you say pragmatic you're not talking about
(38:13) philosophical pragmatism you're talking about we'd say in the Commons like um practical you mean like kind of
(38:19) practical when you say pragmatic yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah sure it's practical um but because it's practical
(38:26) doesn't mean that that's what the meaning of it is just to say that I I live in this Society too Neil these guys
(38:32) all live in this Society too right because we're Christians we're not supposed to be devoted to suffering for
(38:38) suffering sake right and if we can make these positive changes which we call
(38:43) these sins of omission if you can help if you can do something you don't that's sinful yeah okay that's a sin of that's
(38:49) a sin of omission so it's like why shouldn't we be making these sort of adjustable changes that we can make to
(38:56) the things which in condition which are going on around us to the benefit of not just us but everybody else because we
(39:02) know Christianity is true we know it's righteous we know it's real we know it's something that benefits everybody even
(39:07) if they're not Christians why shouldn't we be trying to re this stuff in utilizing our own Social Power right and
(39:14) what are we talking about by Social Power are we saying show up with cudgels and beat people to death the opposite
(39:19) we're saying hey boycott them stop buying their stuff or we're saying put a
(39:25) significant amount of pressure on this uh this company so they stop doing XYZ or uh hey put some pressure on your
(39:31) elected officials right to say hey why don't you pass something that says you got to be 18 before you can go on a porn
(39:38) site but what you just said is there's nothing that now needs to change to to do what you're talking about there is
(39:44) something that now needs to change that through the there is what needs to change right now is that Christians need to become and move towards and continue
(39:51) to stay in when they achieve it the dominant Social Power which they can do through voting and
(39:57) I totally agree they can do all that through voting and everything else so if we say a Christian Nation like what did
(40:03) you think we thought we we what did you thinkr that we were going to bring in the Byzantine Empire declare Trump the
(40:10) emperor and then like what did you what did you think we were trying to do when I hear Christian nationalism I think of some sort of Theocratic system where the
(40:17) church is in is has actual powers that can it can dictate certain things in in
(40:23) in society power is a strange thing because power it what can be an
(40:28) institution that you give authority to even if it's not elected like this happens now okay uh there are certain
(40:36) like let's say the World Health Organization right I didn't elect anybody in the world World Health Organization neither did you but you're
(40:43) not going to argue with me that they're not a very powerful group true and it's because when they release their mandates
(40:48) documents things like this people give it a lot of adherence they like wait these are experts we should listen to
(40:54) what they're saying right they we have a lot of trust in them they exercise a lot of power right power is not always
(41:00) exercised through just voting and through things like this but also through the trust of Institutions or the
(41:06) trust of value structures that people have so you could have an idea of like
(41:13) uh a Christian social order which has a lot of power just because they say things like look we're going to put
(41:19) significant pressure on you to put in Christian ethics from the from the top
(41:25) down using democracy using voting using your systems and aren't we allowed to do that under your
(41:31) system aren't we encouraged to do that under your system so why shouldn't we be just going full bore to grab as much of
(41:39) that power as we possibly can so that we can make those changes I'm just trying to figure out what the difference is
(41:44) then between between what between the system we have right now that just worked that Christians aren't the dominant Social Power that's the
(41:51) difference and when Christians become the dominant Social Power then you'll have true Christian Nation that like to
(41:56) you when they when they have this the dominant power what does that look like to you that significant pressures are then put on government institutions and
(42:03) NOS to become an arm of Christianity rather than uh operate with Independence
(42:09) against Christianity okay an arm of Christianity what does that mean what are they doing
(42:14) like so like right now NOS will give money to groups to infiltrate churches to give them counter training towards
(42:20) lgbtq right bunch of documents just recently released on this you I'm sure you read them okay little bit yeah yeah
(42:26) so the NG they non-government organizations give out tons of money uh to various groups
(42:32) who go in and say hey look you guys are having trouble with lgbtq people getting the correct Counseling in your church
(42:38) don't worry we have a special counselor Faith Counselor come in and help assist train you uh away from things like
(42:45) conversion therapy this type of thing right so these are special interest groups by secist organization and
(42:52) atheist organizations which trying to infiltrate the church to exercise power we're just offering do the same thing in
(42:58) Reverse okay how about we send in our non-government organizations and we say hey look only fans people let us give
(43:04) you some training on how to get the [ __ ] out of only fans right let us let us do the same thing just in the opposite
(43:11) direction let us push forward the values and ideas that we have and if you're willing to use Force for your ideals you
(43:18) can't then be hypocritical and say we can't use Force for our ideals let's talk about that for a second okay people
(43:23) start to rebel and you get even if it's not the majority let's say you do you
(43:28) get there yeah the the majority of of people in power are Christian but the
(43:34) people aren't and people start to Riot and destroy cities what are you going to
(43:39) do yeah so you would do the exact same thing you would do right now under your constitutional republic you martial law
(43:46) right so there's no difference again that's what I'm kind of getting at like what you're no there's a difference what
(43:51) am I telling you the difference is you're going to enforce it yeah so listen so let's let's do an experiment
(43:57) social experim just like right now so we can see if if um well let's try it this
(44:03) way do rights exist I mean they they exist because
(44:09) something makes them exist yeah yeah they exist inside your mind right yeah it's metaphysical if you think about it yeah sure so they don't exist in reality
(44:16) you can't touch them you can't touch them smell them this and that but they re they exist in reality somebody
(44:21) violates my rights you going to use force uh could you get someone to use
(44:27) Force for you sure yeah right you're going to use get someone to use Force for use the court system whatever so you're willing to use Force for a thing
(44:32) that doesn't exist because you believe in it right what's wrong what's so so hang on so a Christian you think
(44:37) Christianity is not true right I yeah yeah okay so so we believe in something
(44:43) also that is not true according to you but if you violate it we'd be willing to
(44:48) use force in order to do something about that like you would for my rights so what's the difference you saying I have
(44:53) a thing which does I I have a thing that doesn't exist but I'm willing to use force in order to enforce like it does
(45:00) exist how's that any different than you saying Christianity doesn't exist but you're willing to use Force as though it
(45:05) does exist how's it difference but there's a there's big difference here let me and let me explain it I can't
(45:11) wait to hear it with with rights we're talking about a system that is made up
(45:16) it doesn't matter if it's made up yeah I know right exactly the the the the Constitution is what makes this entire
(45:22) thing work which is made up doesn't matter it's the you're country that doesn't have a
(45:28) constitution so if Christianity isn't true doesn't matter what happens if I go to Saudi Arabia and I start saying that
(45:33) Muhammad is BL whatever and just think of something crazy they're going to behead you probably and put your head on a spike I can do that here why yeah you
(45:40) can do that here because no one can enforce anything against me for saying that yeah right so there's a reality
(45:46) behind it something's actually working because well the reality is the force you're willing to use for the thing that doesn't exist doesn't matter and you're
(45:53) going to act as though it does exist and use force in order to reinforce it right it's it's like saying knowledge doesn't
(45:58) exist but obviously there's databases of information that are real it's not like saying that what do you mean you agree
(46:04) with me rights themselves don't exist they they do metaphysically where where's where metaphysically even do
(46:10) they exist well okay Bill of Rights Constitution what do you mean you mean the piece of paper but their constructs
(46:16) of the mind is my point exactly that's what I said it's metaphysical they exist okay got it so that's what you mean by metaphysic yeah okay so these constructs
(46:23) of the mind they're not actually true like you don't it's not true that you have a right to freedom of speech
(46:31) right that's not a that's not true but but here's the thing nothing would happen to me here where we have fre
(46:39) disagree in comparison to somewhere not dise because the use of force so you see how there's a reality the reality is
(46:44) exactly the same I if I make up something exactly the same I'm not getting beheaded if yeah I know if I
(46:50) make up something in my brain like let me this is god let's say yeah this is
(46:56) God uh and its properties are if you say K's light is better than Bud Light you
(47:01) get beheaded right now I'm willing to use Force um on behalf of this thing
(47:06) that you don't believe is true okay but you use Force right now on behalf of things you don't believe are true right
(47:12) but it makes it's it's the it's the process behind the whole entire system
(47:18) is that there's a Bill of Rights there's a constitution everyone has these things in common it puts I'm not disputing that
(47:25) force that you using Force has results right but if you don't have those met metaphysical things think of how
(47:32) different things would be yeah they would be very different so there there's a real that's what I'm saying there's a
(47:37) reality that is a result of the fake um just like the reality of me believing
(47:44) what you consider what you would be consider to be fake God has huge benefits for guys like you right I agree
(47:51) I was I was hoping you would we would go there because so if that so if that's the case like we're we're basically religion people right we agree on that
(47:58) religionis Christianity and other religions too I've looked this up I've actually brought some studies some more than others uh University of California
(48:05) did brain scans to determine brain my brain scans well there's other ones too I'm
(48:11) sure it's good science bro uh there there's report there's studies from Duke University about
(48:16) meditation um improving cognitive performance University at Wisconsin did
(48:22) did studies that showed both of those two are correct um point is people who are religious do
(48:29) have better lives yeah but that's why I'm agreeing with you that there's a even if it's metaphysical not real
(48:34) there's a reality behind it but the same thing exists for rights right no there's
(48:40) no reality to rights I just explained it I no no no what you here's you're you're confusing the truth with the effect the
(48:48) idea is like here's what's actually true what's true is the effect is the you pretend the effect is the truth though
(48:54) yeah the effect is true yeah I agree with that's all I'm saying yeah yeah I agree with that I agree same religion yeah yeah I agree that the effect is
(49:01) true so neither of us are going to dispute that the effect is true on both ends right what I'm saying to you is
(49:06) just simply this that you can't criticize people for using force on
(49:11) behalf of their fictitious Sky daddy if you use force on behalf of your fictitious piece of [ __ ] paper right
(49:18) what you're doing is you're just saying here's the values that I have and I'm willing to kill on behalf of them those are the values they have they're willing
(49:24) to kill on behalf of them if it's all subjective and not nonsense I'm confused if it's all subjective and nonsense
(49:30) right you're both applying the same standard I don't even know how you could criticize him for that's what I was saying you just came back around to what
(49:36) I was saying I'm saying even though I don't believe it doesn't matter if I believe in Christianity or not there's a reality behind is what I'm saying the
(49:42) same there's reality to the effect for you yes and so that's so what I'm saying what I postulate is that our social
(49:48) order right the social order of the United States should move towards Christian ethics that would be much
(49:53) better for the United States I mean come on Dawkins himself wasn't Dawkins a guy recently he like oh I really miss the
(50:00) Christmas carols because I was able to waar I Love Christmas gay sweaters and uh I just miss them I also I also really
(50:08) enjoy when I'm studying ancient Greek and Roman religion well like I there's
(50:13) things about religion that are great and I don't think it's necessarily just this push for so the social order being
(50:19) dominantly Christian and the dominant Christian effect in society that's what Christian nationalism is proposing that
(50:25) we move so far away from those values that now we have other values which are beginning to overtake them hookup
(50:30) culture degeneracy of all types like for instance you can't even really talk to a
(50:36) secularist now Neil and ask him a basic question like this why should we even have monogamy like why should we and
(50:43) they they're like I think most people prefer it over anything else well I think most people I think most people who have Christian inclinations would
(50:51) yeah but not even but the truth is is like the open the open marriage thing and the open relationship things
(50:57) becoming more popular right there's no real reason why I think non-christians enjoy like if you say two men can get
(51:03) married why can't 20 men get married Neil that's polygamy though we're talking monogamy yeah what's wrong with
(51:10) polygamy I you're asking me about my preference is yeah is that it a
(51:15) preference I don't like it yeah it's my preference right I don't like it no but but as far as monogamy goes that goes
(51:21) outside of just Christianity people prefer to be with one person have a family with one person people prefer
(51:26) that life yeah they could be but if the dominant social order is Christian right
(51:31) we want to normalize that as much as possible is the point so that would be like positive positive forms of I would
(51:38) say rhetoric you could say propaganda propaganda is a negative connotation but we would want to have real propaganda
(51:44) towards one man one woman not towards alternative Lifestyles towards things like this that's what Christian
(51:49) nationalism would propose right I I believe that the social power in the United States is even more more
(51:56) important than the political power because ultimately I think the political power is influenced by the Social Power
(52:02) we've seen this with the Trans movement right the legislation which has happened from the various powers from lgbtq
(52:08) groups who have social authorities kind of given to them and social sciences which grant them these authorities I'm
(52:15) saying Christians can do the same exact thing and need to be doing the same and we haven't been we haven't been so we've
(52:21) lost that dominant Edge in society and we need to get it back we didn't talk about anything about education which I think would be probably the force behind
(52:29) your what you what you would need to get done what you want because you mean indoctrination schooling yeah growing up
(52:36) in school and learning how to live or whatever what would you propose on that back like obviously Catholic schools and
(52:43) then we have public school I would propose a movement which is gaining a lot of steam thanks to co finally which
(52:48) is homeschooling homeschooling the idea is to move people out of public schools as quickly as not Orthodoxy in control
(52:54) of the school no that would be well listen that would be a bad idea for a lot of reasons okay that would be a bad
(53:01) yeah it' be a bad idea for a lot of reasons it has to it has to at least have a semblance of it can work right
(53:08) for me to promote it or propose it here's what can work I think that so that Orthodoxy itself will begin to
(53:14) overtake other denominations just by you seeing the result of the people who follow it and the pushing of the social
(53:21) needle because the people who follow it are doing that pushing people will gravitate towards it anyway we don't
(53:27) have to use Force I can use rhetoric I can use things that are at my disposal to convince people one thing that is
(53:33) very convincing to people though is when they take their kids out of school and they homeschool there's no indoctrination sure there's no
(53:40) indoctrination and right now you can do that you can get you can do homeschooling yeah and I Pro I'm I
(53:45) promote everywhere that people should attempt as quickly as possible to do it even if it's only half the time you know
(53:51) the problem is is that schools have become babysitting they schools are designed to babysit kids not to educate
(53:58) them what about parents that can't homeschool they're just like dead beats they can't do it yeah unfortunately like
(54:04) one thing that was proposed to fix this was school vouchers you know what I mean so that you could take the money that
(54:10) you would normally be paid to the public school for the you know your child's seat so they get like you know 20 bucks
(54:17) a day or 30 bucks a day or whatever instead that goes to the parent to pick the school so they could set them to a
(54:22) private school that did that didn't have that sort of indoctrination Public Schools do however that was resisted
(54:28) right right this kind of goes back to what I was saying you do have to have some sort of public not well whether
(54:34) it's private or public whatever you have to have some sort of state school system in place for those people no private
(54:39) schools could accommodate that private Christian Schools basically what you're saying is just get rid of public schools
(54:44) then everyone else can choose between private public schools aren't producing people who are very very educated man
(54:50) most of them can't read they can't write our literacy levels are are low pull I mean you can Google it on
(54:57) your phone go ahead look at the literacy rate it's not great you know do you feel like our schools are cranking out
(55:03) educated people Neil well I'll take your word on that but do you do you think so Neil do you think they're cranking out
(55:10) educated people yeah you do I went to a public school and I know plenty of people who are lawyers and doctors and
(55:15) and high positions that went to the public school school with me yeah yeah okay I'm just I'm not everybody
(55:20) obviously yeah a lot of [ __ ] who are coming out of these Public Schools right that's all right I'll give you that there's lot of dip shits in public
(55:26) school so the thing is is like look um we can you can give parents the choice to utilize that money to move into a
(55:32) school district which is good for them right yeah so no Neil the Orthodox
(55:39) aren't here to say we're going to take over the entire government but with use of force and machine guns we're here to
(55:44) say through social and gradual change right we want to produce the results that we want by becoming a dominant
(55:50) force in society by the way that's how Communists got where they're at with us
(55:56) yeah doing the exact same thing right I just propose it in reverse and that is Christian
(56:02) nationalism invade their stupid little ngos wreck their little safe spaces get
(56:07) right in their stupid little faces and tell them no what was your reasons when I brought I brought up the uh Oregon
(56:13) thing and I also brought up the refugees from Russia coming here they were they were actually setting up because they
(56:19) speak russan they didn't speak anything else and they came here and set up little communes in certain places in America and there some of them still
(56:26) exist to this day yeah what's what was your I I don't think I don't think I heard you say anything of why you don't
(56:31) think that would be the a better route for someone who's someone like yourself
(56:37) and a whole community of people that wanted to start a community of whatever
(56:42) communes exist right now Orthodox communes especially they're called monks right they they live in literal communes
(56:49) that are supposed to be self- sustaining not everyone is not saying everyone has to be a monk I'm saying you have but that's what but that's what how they
(56:55) live build a brand new like like little com like you know a city basically yeah
(57:00) for what for what purpose I don't want some of the society I want all of it Neil yeah we don't want a few Souls we
(57:06) want all of them Neil um it's like Pokemon right you got to catch them all that's true that is kind of the end
(57:15) game that you mentioned earlier so we want them all um you don't get to you don't you
(57:20) don't get any we yeah right it's all our pizza and universities
(57:27) they start you know universities are Tech uh mostly liberal
(57:32) mostly sometimes go as far as being Marxist as you might know yeah what about that what about it how do you how
(57:39) do you get inside that what's what's the what's the Communist guess that's kind of what I've been getting at this whole
(57:44) time is what's the logistics behind yeah so I've always said and I've always said this on stream from the very beginning
(57:50) and I just said it to you a few minutes ago it's not a 20-year plan it's not a 30-year plan it's a 3 100 year plan the
(57:58) idea is you start 10 20 years the same way Marxist did right you encourage
(58:05) Christians the dominant force in society to enter into those types of Institutions which they're beginning to do right you do the same thing that the
(58:12) Marxist did you just give reverse propaganda it's the same thing you we don't need to go in with a barrel of a
(58:18) gun to change the culture of a university we just infiltrate it like they infiltrated it so I guess what I
(58:24) would I almost don't object to what you're saying of course not it's completely reasonable because what what
(58:29) you're you're saying is we're going to do it through the system right now and we're just GNA Christianity has always
(58:34) done this we've used Martyrs to do it what did the martyrs were our Martyrs
(58:41) going in suicide bombing no our Martyrs were saying hey because the system is so
(58:46) corrupt right we will peaceably non-violently die on behalf of our
(58:51) beliefs right that's what they were doing well what I'm saying is the reason why I'm not I'm saying I don't OB what you're saying cuz it almost sounds like
(58:58) you're just hoping that everybody starts converting to Christianity no no what
(59:03) I'm saying is that Christians need to be a driving force in society to convince other Christians to become a social
(59:12) Powerhouse convince their churches convince their pastors it's time to become activated but if nothing
(59:18) systematically is changing as what I'm trying to systems will necessarily change to find out what systematic the
(59:23) culture necessarily changes the system sure I know that's that's the point of the uh of of a Democratic Republic
(59:31) things change the culture is necessarily going to change that could this could have happened already but people are are
(59:37) actually going in the opposite direction yeah and I'm trying to stop that that's the point that's what so if it keeps
(59:42) going the opposite direction then what then I mean we'll do what Christians have always done we'll continue to fight
(59:50) an uphill battle against the absolute Madness of the world the best way that we possibly can but but what we're
(59:56) talking about with Christian nationalism is what we're talking about with Christian nationalism is not going
(1:00:03) kicking in your door Neil and dragging off your gay brother because we don't like his face very much what we're
(1:00:08) talking about doing is using the um kind of using the system which is in
(1:00:16) place and doing a counter indoctrination utilizing it for our purposes instead of
(1:00:21) just allowing secularists to use it for their purposes I believe that that's actually better but that's just for
(1:00:26) political power that's just liberal democracy working in your favor great that's all it is yes and that was just
(1:00:34) liberal democracy working in the favor of the Communist I problem with that is I'm not saying so you're a Christian nationalist no
(1:00:41) yes no no no no let me let me explain let me explain I don't have a problem
(1:00:46) with the system working in your favor I just it's the system that I'm that I'm supporting yes right great so the system
(1:00:54) you support so supports the system I propose but it can go in any direction though so that's yeah but I want it to
(1:01:00) go my direction it might go in a direction of complete degeneracy and it's still the system that I I still prefer I know but let me ask you a
(1:01:05) question yeah if by supporting us right in the system that you already love and
(1:01:10) it leads to less of that degeneracy which you don't like shouldn't you support
(1:01:16) us it depends on there's a lot of things a lot of factors that I would have to be depends on who's the president what's
(1:01:22) the what the policies are it depends yeah but if our goal if our ultimate stated goal is to eliminate that
(1:01:28) degeneracy like if you're saying and doing it inside of the very system you propos if you're talking about just the
(1:01:33) result blind to how it happens then sure yeah great you don't want degeneracy you want people to be happy Christian
(1:01:39) nationalist agree on everything like that Christian nationalist NE I just don't know if I I don't I think you should Rebrand it until populism or
(1:01:45) something we should call it christianism yeah there you go christianism all I'm saying is my I guess what I'm getting at
(1:01:51) is I was trying to dig and to find out like what major dra IC systemic changes
(1:01:57) you would do like maybe I don't think you realize how I don't think you realize how major and drastic those changes are really I didn't I didn't
(1:02:03) really hear much so yeah I don't think you really so like imagine this that we've been living your whole life you've
(1:02:10) been living where things like a pornography were legal you've been living your entire life where the you
(1:02:15) know the Playboy at the gas station was there right or you've been living your whole life where these things were
(1:02:21) readily available to you you imagine you say well this just a moderate change
(1:02:26) that porn is gone it's like no that's a major change that's a major societal change one that you've never even lived
(1:02:32) without right and like for you to say well well these just sound like really moderate changes like in a way that's
(1:02:37) great for me because I can go well yeah we're just barely tweaking the system so just don't don't look over here go go
(1:02:43) over there and do your thing right but what I'm I'm seeing it happen through the Democratic process
(1:02:49) of Democratic Republic yeah that's the system yeah that's how the system's in place like what did you think we were
(1:02:55) going to do like ride our chariots in Rebellion against the United States well I guess when you hear the term Christian
(1:03:00) nationalism you think that we want a Christian Nation you want a Christian Nation and how to do that you you know
(1:03:06) might there might be some drastic system there's not even another way to do it you have two choices with any system
(1:03:12) system one you use the system to change the system system two you burn the system down that's it right you don't
(1:03:19) you don't really have any other choices so I don't want to burn the system down I'm glad you hear that I want to U ize
(1:03:26) Christian Force right in in culture in order to make these effective changes
(1:03:32) and the best way for us to do that is to remember that we have the power of the boycott that we have various powers of
(1:03:37) social shame that we can use our freedom of speech in ways that don't seem very nice remember this it's so powerful in
(1:03:43) fact what did tech companies do for 20 years all they do is they go well I don't like what you're saying gone
(1:03:50) you're blacklisted you're nobody can hear your speech nobody can hear what you're saying nobody can nobody can you
(1:03:56) can't even bank right so they use a um they use a form of like non-force to
(1:04:03) just deerson you right what I'm saying is that instead of allowing them to deerson you right we can use the same
(1:04:10) type of social structures to basically deerson them to say no you know uh under
(1:04:16) our system since most people agree with me and the social shame is there maybe the prostitute can't come into our
(1:04:21) Bakery maybe the prostitute doesn't want to because people give her the dirty looks and the this and the that right
(1:04:27) I'm glad you brought that up who determines who's how what if you just want to use that person's a prostitute I
(1:04:32) don't want to serve them even though they're not you know yeah I mean that's I'm saying like the reason why you don't you
(1:04:38) have those discrimination law but that's I mean that but that happens now like that happens now they just hide it right
(1:04:44) like God I want to serve this person based on this or that you know what I mean they have all sort they just don't admit what the what the motivation well
(1:04:49) I don't even think people should have to serve someone yeah exactly so that's not even against your value structure anyway
(1:04:55) it's libertarianism right if I don't like the color of your eyes I don't have to serve
(1:05:00) you um no it's it's more it's not my I not I would not a Libertarian it's more I just believe in free market capitalism
(1:05:08) okay as a so then if you just suspect a person's a prostitute don't want to serve them totally up to you right yeah
(1:05:14) if as an owner of a of of your own company I man it's Christian nalism really that's the thing it's going to
(1:05:21) happen going to happen I mean I this isn't much of a trial Neil no I mean look look what I'm hearing does the
(1:05:28) prosecution rest well what I'm hearing is I don't want to change anything I just want to get people to agree with me
(1:05:35) and get into places of power and then you so what you heard from me is I don't want to change anything really well no
(1:05:40) no no I don't want to change anything as far as the structure of Democratic Republic or just like the Communist I
(1:05:47) don't the Communists used and subverted the structure of power I'm saying Christians are also going to use and
(1:05:52) subvert the structure of power but then once they has once they had control they completely went into complete power
(1:06:00) where where was control where it was a control a command economy and directly from the state in control of everything
(1:06:07) and that's what I that's what I was trying to figure out if that's where where your Christian nationalism was heading but what hang on hang on back up
(1:06:15) back up I'm talking about communist in the United States communist in the united stat just the United States have
(1:06:20) already subverted power UC system yeah they didn't need to change the Democratic structures because
(1:06:26) the same weapons they use we can use you're talking about like Marxist and Academia stuff like that yeah not just Marxist and Academia but I mean Marxist
(1:06:34) and propaganda and media okay cuz I was I was thinking you're saying the propaganda and media means more than anything you need to understand this
(1:06:40) right it's like if everybody ignores a law it's it's not a law why this happened during the mass mandates if
(1:06:46) everybody in an area ignored the mass mandates they didn't exist the law was completely useless and worthless as long
(1:06:51) as people ignored it it's the social power that matters it's the media power
(1:06:56) that matters the propaganda that matters you can also choose you can also choose between Fox News and CNN you have
(1:07:03) there's different different media Outlets that say different that push different world the media landscape has changed which makes this possible in a
(1:07:09) way that it didn't used to be possible yeah no I I actually I actually think that's good the media landscape should
(1:07:14) change and be more diverse yeah but it makes this this idea actually now possible and
(1:07:21) viable it's actually possible it's actually viable where now okay we got X
(1:07:26) we have other other public platforms we're not getting thrown off for saying hey uh we have alternative ideas about
(1:07:32) transgender lgbtq uh we we have alternative ideas uh when it comes to immigration we have
(1:07:39) alternative ideas when it comes to who we're going to important to our nation who have different uh foundational
(1:07:45) ethics than we do right we have all sorts of different ideas now and so it's like now though we're not just being
(1:07:50) deerson for them because the land the landscape of the technocrats has changed
(1:07:56) last thing I want to ask you about and then um because I think we're getting towards the end um to have a free market
(1:08:04) system you sort of you sort of need there to be some free reign on what you
(1:08:11) consider degenerate what what's not what do you do to sort of monitor the market
(1:08:17) so that it can it continues in your ideal Christian uh way do you agree that there
(1:08:24) were sex robots which were designed for to to be to be like in the likeness of a
(1:08:30) child that there are sex robots that were designed I did not know that they're restricted in the United States
(1:08:35) they won't but what about my free market Neil all right good point all
(1:08:42) right you got me on that last one all right you got me so you okay okay yeah I
(1:08:47) think I let me just sum up when I what I've heard I guess you can can say something right back it doesn't sound
(1:08:53) like you really want to take over the system and turn it upside down I think
(1:08:58) you no I do I do let me let me let me explain myself you you sound like you want to use the system as it is now to
(1:09:06) enforce to slowly get to a place where people agree with you and then then they
(1:09:11) get in those places of power and then they enforce laws the correct way which is just normal de it's just normal
(1:09:18) Classical liberalism for Christians basically yeah no I think that we can we
(1:09:24) can make our own propaganda we can make our own form of and uh and
(1:09:30) movements towards the things we want like the Marxist now how fast the marxists do it 60 years something like
(1:09:35) that way quicker than you think right even in your lifetime since you were a kid right now life's changed a lot
(1:09:41) hasn't it things things go back and forth I I just just social interaction
(1:09:46) yeah just social interactions with people have changed it's like this can happen way faster than you think and
(1:09:51) opportunity is here where Christians can begin to seize power and I think that that's a way better
(1:09:57) system than what we currently have it's not perfect right it's not perfect and you're right there's going to be
(1:10:02) denominational issues and things like this but it's way better than this idea of she just got out of high school and
(1:10:10) now she sells her butthole picks on only fans for $250 a month that's a really bad system bro and a system that allows
(1:10:17) that is a really bad system so yeah that would be that would
(1:10:23) be what I would do is subvert the system and that's what we're trying to do good on time we can go into the Q&A my guess
(1:10:30) is that there are going to be a lot of questions if you want to line up folks we'll have the Q&A right to my left right here 40 minutes not
(1:10:38) long oh wait yeah we'll back up just a bit to
(1:10:43) that piece of
(1:10:49) tape all right so I'm going to hold on to the mic as usual just to be sure your questions are short and P
(1:10:55) here you go sure two quick questions for Andrew uh one um how important is the religiosity of Christianity versus
(1:11:02) alignment with Christian ethics uh and then the second question is uh we sign
(1:11:08) our names and date them to a date measure all time relative to Jesus's birth globally not just nationally so
(1:11:15) you can't cash a check you can't have a document up in court so uh to what extent have you are we not already
(1:11:22) winning a 2000 plus year old game and we just have a mi mismanagement problem
(1:11:27) that we got to overcome yeah so uh a couple things the uh T to answer to your
(1:11:34) second question yeah we have a mismanagement thing we need to overcome uh does Christianity ultimately always
(1:11:39) win yes is it always going to yes it's always going to uh I fully believe that that is the case the Gates of Hell will
(1:11:45) never uh Prevail against the church then ask your first question can you just tell me real quick what it was again um
(1:11:52) how important is the religiosity of Christianity can you repeat it yeah without the without the enforcement remember the
(1:11:58) it's enforcement arm right it's like so you can be in Andrew can you repeat the question just so they because oh yeah yeah it's how important basically he's
(1:12:05) asking how important is the belief in God rather than just the alignment towards Christian ethics I would say
(1:12:11) that your alignment towards Christian ethics doesn't mean very much without the belief in God because that's the
(1:12:17) thing in which you're driving the morality directly so otherwise you can just change your ethics right and we
(1:12:22) want that unchanging standard yeah and I suppose I me no all right we're done oh
(1:12:27) you got two questions yeah for Andrew thank you um is the Christian activism
(1:12:33) that you suggest vulnerable to corruption without genuine Revival yes
(1:12:41) okay hey uh do you think he'll be uh coming over to the dark
(1:12:46) side I don't know we'll see yeah hope so we we have the best pizza
(1:12:53) question no pineapple question for Andrew so Marxism
(1:13:00) took about what 60 years until it becomes in effect how long would Christian
(1:13:05) nationalism be like realistically it can happen very rapidly it can happen within
(1:13:11) uh just a few years especially when you have a birth rate crisis like we do it doesn't take long especially if you're
(1:13:16) uh bringing in uh immigrants from Nations which are far more uh kind of
(1:13:21) traditionally Catholic and things like this than the Protestants which are here here it can actually happen very
(1:13:29) rapidly two questions uh first question is for Neil Neil um how easy was it for
(1:13:34) Andrew to just change your complete worldview right then I didn't change anything I I feel the same about uh
(1:13:43) before as when I got up here I I was actually happy to hear that he doesn't want he likes classical liberal system
(1:13:50) of voting and having a senate and rep uh House of Representatives andent president never said I liked it I'm just
(1:13:57) saying you you you don't seem like you want to change the system very much except you want to take the system and make it work in your favor and I'm fine
(1:14:03) with that that's the way it works yeah so good question though second question
(1:14:08) Andrew how did you remotely tell Rachel to bring you a beer she just
(1:14:15) [Laughter]
(1:14:20) knows excellent what's your question um I actually was just curious
(1:14:25) on uh both your guys view cuz I'm one that I'm actually agnostic uh but I am
(1:14:31) rooted in Christian ethics like the the principles um so what would you say to
(1:14:37) people who are sort of in that balance where you do believe in the higher power and the gist of most of Christian
(1:14:43) principles but still sort of pull away from the general stories that uh people
(1:14:49) are are told then there's no real rooting because you can just simply change your opinion and you have no
(1:14:56) unchanging standard from which to rely on to not just kind of change your opinion right so it's not that that
(1:15:02) Christians get they don't get to pick and choose their ethics right they have to follow their ethics from an
(1:15:07) unchanging standard even if they don't like in fact most of the time they don't like it right like think think of the
(1:15:14) idea of having Mercy for your enemies it's like I hate that part you know I
(1:15:20) hate that part Hey so uh if since Neil doesn't really
(1:15:28) seem to take much offense to what your plan is if Christian nationalism or
(1:15:36) culturalism became dominant how would Neil and how would you Andrew feel about
(1:15:41) doing things like repealing the 19th Amendment Li limiting suffrage uh rolling back some of the gay marriage
(1:15:48) stff Rachel that's just how the system works right Neil that's just how the system yep it is
(1:15:55) theoretically people came out and voted for those things and it works it works that's just how this is so when I say
(1:16:03) things like I'm not I'm not wavered on that so when I say things like we're going to repeal the 19th what what
(1:16:09) you're saying is that's just how the system works totally viable it's totally viable and reasonable as long as
(1:16:15) Christian nationalism gets a foothold in and we use the social powers in order to change the ideas of the politicians like
(1:16:21) much like the marxists did that they could like I don't know the 19th like they did maybe for abortion right right
(1:16:28) I actually was surprised that happened I didn't think that was going to ever happen everybody was surprised it happened but like I said it can happen very rapidly it's like let's not pretend
(1:16:35) that this is not viable right it's just that we get to pervert the system back right we get to do it back to them the
(1:16:42) same thing they did to us so you were saying that in a
(1:16:48) Christian nationalist framework that when you get to the point of being in
(1:16:53) power Protestant Catholics Orthodox they they have dialogue and they decide which becomes
(1:17:00) the power base which becomes the base of the social Force but you can't really Ally with Protestants though because
(1:17:07) they don't have that unchanging ethic they don't have a central Force MH like
(1:17:13) Catholics do and Orthodox do to almost the same degree but Protestants there's
(1:17:18) 40,000 churches so how can you Ally with Protestants well you wouldn't be allying with them but they would be Ling with
(1:17:25) you how how can they be a part of your movement those they would be outlying with you so they would just have the Sim similar aims for the universal portions
(1:17:32) of the ethics right so the universal portions like probably abortion uh
(1:17:38) lgbtq uh kind of marriage reforms things like that those would be things that they'd be moving towards too remember
(1:17:43) here in the United States we've always had tons of Protestant denominations right long before uh the 20th century
(1:17:51) that was still the case right and they still had kind of universals that they all consider to be a constant now I'm
(1:17:57) not saying that uh theological infighting is not going to happen because it is but it's like yeah but
(1:18:03) it'll happen after we get rid of a lot of these things like only fans etc etc so like let's have the fight
(1:18:15) then what rights are taken away from you as a Christian what's that what rights
(1:18:21) were taken away from you as a Christian did I say rights were taken away from me as a Christian you're kind of talking about rights being taken away from other
(1:18:28) people and sound what right what right the 19th Amendment okay so gay marriage wait wait
(1:18:35) my position yes so hang on I'll answer each one my position on voting is not
(1:18:40) that it only women shouldn't vote but that mostly men shouldn't vote either and remember that at our foundation
(1:18:47) people couldn't vote it was not a thing universal suffrage wasn't a thing and by the way let me ask you a question why do
(1:18:53) you want stupid people vote like why do you think that's a good idea that's a really bad idea that we have stupid
(1:18:59) people who can vote and nullify the vote of informed people it's a terrible idea hang on second when you're talking about
(1:19:06) uh repealing gay marriage complet what are you talking about I all I'm advocating for is that is complete
(1:19:12) fairness if I can only marry a woman a gay man can only marry a woman totally
(1:19:20) fair but where is that fair because you're not gay what does that have to do with anything you're not guay so what I
(1:19:26) can only marry a woman he can only marry a woman that really makes I don't understand that argument well it's fair
(1:19:32) I don't understand if I break cookie and half I get half the cookie you get half the cookie right okay sure but but I
(1:19:39) also have the decision if I want the cookie or not yeah well here's the thing why does the state need to get involved for gay marriage anyway why can't we get
(1:19:46) the state out of marriage and then gays can have what they called civil unions or they could go get married outside of
(1:19:52) a church or not be recognized by Christians because Christians don't recognize their marriages now so the
(1:19:57) reason why we need these unions is that so Partners can make Health decisions
(1:20:03) for others in case of they can do it now you can put it somebody in charge of your health right this second why can't
(1:20:09) you I have already yeah you can't you can do it right now you don't need to you don't need to be married to put
(1:20:15) someone in charge of your health decisions but there are then laws that come in place if you happen to not do
(1:20:22) that like like when you're in a relationship that you're not able to
(1:20:28) then have these legal documents saying yes this is my NEX ofin this is the person who is going to be able to make
(1:20:33) these legal decisions and that sounds like really bad planning so your only
(1:20:39) objection here is if gay men get married then they instantly enter into a status
(1:20:45) of he gets to make medical decisions on my behalf that's your objection even though he can not get married to him and
(1:20:51) that person can still make medical decisions on his behalf if it's just he's too lazy to go draft the
(1:20:57) documentation so that he can make the the medical decisions on his behalf do I got this
(1:21:02) right I hear you I hear where you see my FL the flaw and what I am saying yeah
(1:21:08) however it is then also scary when we go to take away rights why do you find it
(1:21:13) scary when you take away people's right to own a oh I don't know machine gun is that scary for you you mean like an
(1:21:19) AR-15 yeah no no no like an actual machine gun I know I live with guns yeah I know
(1:21:25) but an actual machine gun that's my question it's like people don't seem to find it too scary to take away all sorts
(1:21:30) of Rights oh no that was not okay Ma about that what's that we should all
(1:21:36) machine gun sure yeah I mean if we take that if if he said no we shouldn't isn't that taking a right away then like this
(1:21:43) is always reducible same thing with the First Amendment like if we had hate speech laws would you be okay with
(1:21:49) that Define what you mean by hate speech laws like you said something like the fur to a gay man uh that would be hate
(1:21:57) speech and so you're saying you're asking would you be okay with that being a a hate speech law is my
(1:22:04) question I think it then comes down to common decency that's not my question would you
(1:22:11) be okay with that being a hate hate speech law I don't think somebody should go to
(1:22:17) jail for words okay got it so then my freedom of speech should be able to entail me being able to call people the
(1:22:23) F slur right then becomes some human decency yeah
(1:22:29) you're your objection is you're just a jerk if we want to go back to Christian yeah whatever you want yeah sure go
(1:22:34) ahead wasn't it Jesus who said he who he who is without sin casts the first St
(1:22:39) yeah but do you know what that means he who has not had sin mhm is able to now
(1:22:46) go and persecute someone no it doesn't mean okay what does it mean it doesn't
(1:22:52) mean that persecution can happen from perfect right so what Jesus is pointing
(1:22:58) out here is hypocrisy uh but there's righteous judgment when when you're talking about the Bible right we can read about
(1:23:04) righteous judgment Christians are actually to judge this idea that Christians aren't to judge is not in the
(1:23:10) Bible we're not only allowed to judge but especially judge each other that's how we keep each other on the straight and narrow that's how we keep each other
(1:23:16) on the right path when you're talking about judgment for the immortal Soul that's the territory of God but human
(1:23:21) beings have to make judgments we have to make value judgments about each other all the time we have to there's no
(1:23:28) choice comes into confirmed consent sorry
(1:23:33) okay that 99 that was crazy no uh my question is for you Andrew and we're
(1:23:39) talking a lot about how to touch this water that wo touched up here I think you why did dude this trans vagina all
(1:23:46) over um okay real quick transaminated or no trans contaminated there we go go ahead all right go ahead okay but Andrew
(1:23:53) I've heard you talk a lot about how Christian nationalism would be good for the country but if that was the case
(1:23:58) what would that do to Christianity don't you think that that would kind of hurt Christianity if like we had a Christian Nation then you'd have all these fake
(1:24:04) Christians right trying to fit in and isn't that worse than being like a sinner isn't it being a fake Christian like one of the worst things you can do
(1:24:10) so wouldn't that dilute the Christian religion and theoretically could
(1:24:16) potentially hurt Christianity by making it a Christian Nation the problem is you got tons of fake Christians now but if
(1:24:21) we're gonna have tons of fake Christians then at least we'll get rid of the only
(1:24:27) fans right so it's like that's the status the status right now is that most
(1:24:32) people's self ID as Christian don't actually practice the faith that's the truth but but do you think that I guess
(1:24:38) my only question is if we became a Christian nationalist country and I could see the benefits of that does it
(1:24:44) help Christianity overall or I think it does overall yeah sounds good I think it does that's my question thank you okay
(1:24:50) thanks Alex appreciate it I think that's it for
(1:24:56) questions last ones otherwise we're going to do our vote and that'll give us
(1:25:01) plenty of time for dinner too in case anybody's traveling off site did I even get one person to switch to my side or
(1:25:07) no we'll find out I think so and remember that that normally I would have
(1:25:12) devastated poor Neil over here and he would have deserved it but this was the opportunity for my my worldview to be on
(1:25:19) trial so I thought I did a pretty good job of not attacking yours so
(1:25:29) this is a the time when we'll vote if you lean more towards Andrew's position
(1:25:35) that Christian nationalism you're like yeah it's fine or maybe you're
(1:25:40) pro-christian nationalism maybe I should put it that way and then remember only vote if you
(1:25:46) voted in the first one and then well actually sorry Bob you done Cy all right keep keep your hands up
(1:25:53) please again if you're watching online you can vote at the manifold Link in the
(1:25:59) description on who you think will be most persuasive in this debate determined via our hand pole all
(1:26:07) right you can goad put your hands down and if you lean more towards Gnostic informance position where you think that
(1:26:14) Christian nationalism is bad you slide your hand up
(1:26:20) nice I got a couple
(1:26:25) that's not fair they weren't here earlier I think so I think you're right all right

(1:26:39) 10 after the debate Andrew went up to 28 ntic dropped to
(1:26:45) five I win with that think you did

(1:27:04) Neil it was fun appreciate Neil jumped in last minute to tough job do this
(1:27:11) debate so we do appreciate that Neil and with that we'll let you go to dinner so Bob you'll see in the back can you raise
