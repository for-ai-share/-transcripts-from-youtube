(0:00) with the W.
(0:05) Did you just let someone up? Andrew Wilson. Andrew Wilson, how you doing today?
(0:10) I'm doing great. Andrew Wilson, who why why do I have to let you up? Who Who are you?
(0:16) I'm nobody from nowhere. Um, but I did I I do like the prompt and I I thought I
(0:21) would talk with you about it if you got a few minutes for me. Oh, of course. So, why uh why do men need women?
(0:28) for things such as reproduction and for the continuation and prosperity of sight. Most women uh do you do you agree with
(0:35) me or do you think that most women right the second can't reproduce?
(0:41) Most women right the second cannot reproduce? No, I don't think that's the case. Okay. So then what ages do you think
(0:48) women uh can reproduce normally anyway that they can like can not should are
(0:55) capable of? Well, that would just be from pubert. So, well, not really, right? So, like
(1:01) usually it's 20s and 30s is a is the window. Once you get into the 40s, it basically starts to really dry up for
(1:07) most women, right? So, can is different than like should. I didn't say should. I'm not talking about normative ethics. I'm not talking
(1:14) about normative ethics. I'm asking the word can as in as in can actually do it. So, we're not
(1:20) discussing normative ethics here. So when you when you say can so how do you think that more women are uh you know
(1:27) between the ages of uh oh I don't know like uh 1 to 10 and then from uh 40 on
(1:34) or more women who are in the reproductive range sorry
(1:39) do you think there's more women who are outside of that reproduction range who are alive right now uh meaning one one
(1:47) year old to 10 let's say preubescent and then let's say 40 years old on. Don't you think there's more of those women in
(1:53) totality than women who are in their reproductive years? Uh, probably. Yeah.
(1:59) Okay. Then most women can't reproduce. You see how that works? Uh, yeah. I I understand.
(2:07) Great. So then if that's the case, you're saying that men don't need most women, right? Isn't that what you're
(2:13) actually saying? That men don't need most women. We only need women who are in their reproductive years. Andrew,
(2:19) that is just addressing reproduction. Okay. And other point, but we'll get to the other.
(2:24) Well, let's just start with this one at a time. Men don't need most women for reproduction, right?
(2:31) Uh if we're doing the numbers, there's more women that are between the ages of
(2:37) 1 and 10 and what? 40 and older. Uhhuh. Yeah.
(2:43) So then most Yeah. So then most women 11 to 39, I don't know the math on that.
(2:49) Yeah. Yeah. Well, we'll just assume it. But at least half like we don't need at least half of women for reproduction. We
(2:54) can at least say that. Um currently. Okay. But you know the the women that you know
(3:01) are no or turn 11 and now are capable of reproduction would then enter that that zone, right? So it's not like these
(3:08) these people that you're taking out of the equation are are going to be permanently non Yeah. after they've reproduced, what do
(3:13) we need them for? Well, like I said, continuation and prosperity of society. That includes, you know, the different industries that
(3:19) women are, you know, dominating. They're half of the workforce. Um, but that, you know,
(3:25) that wasn't that wasn't always the case. And society prospered just fine when women weren't in the workforce. And
(3:31) there's there's soiety. Yeah. It prospered. Society was prospering at the the same rate that it is right now. And I'm
(3:37) referring to society right now. Uh I think it was it like for instance if you if you look when women were out of when
(3:43) you look when women were out of the workforce do you think that the United States did not still have the top GDP
(3:49) like that would just be compared to other countries during that time? I'm sure they did but doesn't mean that it would better GDP than right now.
(3:55) Yeah. So well the thing is is like when you look at the gross domestic product by the way you also have to look at the
(4:02) incurrence of debt. And so when I look at whether or not uh men need women,
(4:08) you're need here being the the thing which is in question. You really the only claim you can make is that they're
(4:14) necessary for reproduction. But even then I have an issue there. Do you agree that with me that women to be a woman it
(4:22) takes more than just physical characteristics? You're not just your body. There's something more to you than that.
(4:28) uh in order to be a woman. There's something more to being a woman than just them their body.
(4:34) Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, then really we just need women's bodies. We don't even need women, right? For the purpose of
(4:41) reproduction because that goes on No, that goes into like the argument that I was making before about different industries, industries that women dominate, but we
(4:47) haven't really they're not necessary though. You could say that maybe it would hurt or we wouldn't like it or there would be a
(4:54) contraction, but need is the word here. They're not necessary for those industries. And we know that from a
(4:59) historic standard because men worked in all those industries and we prospered fine. You may not say we were as
(5:06) prosperous, but need is a mighty big word here. That's that's saying it's necessary. How's it necessary when all
(5:13) we actually need is the bodies of some fertile women. We don't even need them to be conscious. In fact, like we could
(5:20) just labbotomize them, right? And then make them pump out kids, couldn't we?
(5:26) No, because like I said, I I disagree with like the the standpoint of the jobs, right? So obviously I'm not going
(5:31) to say that we are able to lobomize women because I value them beyond reproduction. I'm not saying No, no, that's a
(5:37) normative ethical claim. We're talking in a hypothetical. We could do this, right? Like
(5:43) all men and just pump out sperm. Well, yeah. I don't know if you could. I see that's the difference, right? It's like I don't think you could labize all
(5:50) men because if you lose all men, industry would collapse. But if you lobottomized all women, I don't think it
(5:55) would. My evidence for this is the historic standard of when most women were out of the workforce industry was
(6:02) fine. It was fine. You may not like the fact that the economy contracts, but need is a big word here. You haven't
(6:08) demonstrated we would need women for these jobs. Yeah. Um, so do you have any like
(6:14) historical evidence that men are necessary for society in terms of like jobs in different industries? Yes. And I'm glad that you bring this
(6:21) up. So let's start with just bone density, muscle mass, and their uh characteristics of being able to repel
(6:27) things like the heat, internal body regulation. Women are unable to do this. That's why they don't enter into these
(6:34) construction jobs because they overheat and die. Unable. Yes, they are actually unable physically. Yes, there's studies on
(6:40) this. Would you like for me to show you them? On average, women are unable to do this. Yes. On average,
(6:45) do what? Repel heat physically incapable to No, that's not what I said. I said on
(6:51) average they're physically incapable of internal body regulation to the point where they can do most of these outdoor
(6:57) jobs without having serious significant problems to them physically. Yes,
(7:03) that's correct. Wait, where's the Can you give me the source for I can in fact give you the source for that?
(7:09) Yeah. And do you can find this? By the way, this is a feminist talking point. I don't even know why you would refute it.
(7:14) Why do you think women are always complaining about the air conditioning in in the building? It's always so cold in the building for the woman.
(7:21) It's a big point of contention. But here, I asked for the scores. Yeah. Yeah.
(7:28) This will be a female body regulation of temperature. Give me a second. I'll pull it up.
(7:37) So, women perceive cold more intensely and they experience heat more intensely. They have trouble due to hormones with
(7:43) regulating body temperature, especially when they're post-menopausal. In fact, you can find hundreds of
(7:49) sources for this. This is not like uh locked down information. Just a cursory Google search on your behalf will show
(7:54) this. Same thing when it comes to bone density. A big problem is bone density and muscle mass differences which
(8:01) required for like some of those big heavy construction tools. Just on average, women do not have the bone
(8:07) density nor muscle mass capable of even wielding such tools.
(8:13) Oh, okay. What's like the the necessary bone density for wielding? I don't know, like like pulling a lever.
(8:21) Oh, really? That's what they do? They pull levers. Well, I mean, if we're talking about like Do they p levers or do they use
(8:27) jackhammers? And do they Yeah. Do have you have you ever used a jackhammer?
(8:34) Different machineries. There are things cranes and there are things like jacks,
(8:39) right? What is the necessary bone density required to hold a Uh, that's a
(8:44) threshold fallacy. I don't need to know the exact density to know that on average women don't have it. And I don't
(8:50) need to know what they don't have if you don't know what the requirement you want. Oh, wait, wait, wait. I'm
(8:55) sorry. Uh, do you think that there's a specific lifting requirement for me to say on average men can lift more? It's
(9:02) like, well, what is more? Is that is that an average one or two pound? It's like, it doesn't it doesn't need to be regulated that way. It's not necessary.
(9:09) What is necessary is that you need to demonstrate the need factor. Why do men need women? Why do we actually need them
(9:17) in these industries? Why is that necessary for for humanity to survive if we if we don't have women in these
(9:23) industries? Yeah. I mean, I I feel like we're jumping from point to point. So,
(9:29) no, that was the point and you jumped off the point, but why do we why are they needed?
(9:34) Why are women Well, like I said, different industries, right? I mean, if you want to get into like the the biological differences between men and
(9:40) women, we could talk about how uh women on average are more nurturing than men um when it comes to specific jobs like
(9:47) teaching, early education. So, what that doesn't mean necessary? Well, I don't think that lifting 200 lb
(9:53) is necessary to be in construction. Okay. But but you're saying that men need women. You you're asking me now to
(10:00) refute whether or not women need men, which isn't even the prompt. Why do men need women? And if we can just lobomize
(10:06) them, turn them into breeding factories, why do we actually need them? Why what's what's the necessary component here?
(10:14) Yeah. So, like I said, things like being more nurturing on average is necessary for the prosperity and continuation of
(10:19) society for industries such as nursing, early education, teaching. Um, I think that if we took that away, these
(10:25) industries would suffer to the point of detrimental effects. Uh, maybe and maybe I can concede that
(10:30) the effects could be detrimental, but that doesn't mean that they're necessary. You see that that word need
(10:36) is like we have to or else. Yeah. Or else society will regress. So
(10:41) when I say things such as the prosperity and continuation of society, that means
(10:47) that we're not going to do things that would regress society because then societyy's not going to be the same one that we want that we want.
(10:52) Says who? Says who? Well, your your version because you you don't like because you don't like because you don't
(10:58) like regression. Like that's your standard, but who cares? You haven't demonstrated why it is that men need
(11:04) women. Hang on. Listen. You haven't demonstrated why men need women. You just say that if it's the case that
(11:10) women move out of certain industries, that could hurt our economic prosperity,
(11:15) but that's not demonstrating that we need you for anything. Yeah. So, I can restate what I've said a
(11:21) million times, which is men need women, right? Men collectively need women collectively for the continuation and
(11:26) prosperity of society. Society is something that men are a part of. Um, so the continuation and prosperity of
(11:31) society obviously is not going to include regression of society. Are you saying that society cannot
(11:37) progress under the model that I give you? It's impossible for society to progress under a model where women hang
(11:43) on hang on let me finish the question. Let me finish the question. Are you saying it's impossible for society to in
(11:50) any way progress? If it is the case that we lobbotomized all the reproductive aged women, right, used them as breeding
(11:56) factories and then men just did all the work and ruled anything, it would be impossible for society to progress. Is that correct?
(12:02) Okay. So, before I answer that, what do you what do you mean by progression? Whatever you Well, uh tech technological
(12:09) innovation, uh society, yeah, society being able to make money, markets working, the fact that we still have
(12:15) industry uh and industries develop, but you know, societal progression, the same thing that you mean.
(12:20) Okay. Yeah. to like continuing in like a positive manner. Yeah. Would you say that? Yeah. No, I don't I don't think that's
(12:25) possible. Demonstrate it. Demonstrate it logically. Yeah. So, women bring unique uh
(12:31) properties, characteristics, etc. to the table. Um and because they are a part of society already and because they are
(12:36) contributing in such a manner that is so positive, if you were to remove that, society would not be able to progress.
(12:41) That's just restating that's just restating it, not demonstrating it. Taking away an extremely impactful part
(12:47) of society. you're regressing it and there's no way to bring that back once you lobomize and why couldn't you why could but why
(12:54) couldn't society still continue to progress with just men even without women being involved even if you
(12:59) regressed all Hang on hang on hang on even if you regress all of society from the female standpoint right you
(13:06) regressed all those jobs why couldn't society still progress and flourish under just men why is that impossible
(13:12) you haven't demonstrated that at all I've demonstrated it right so like I said men we can both agree men and women
(13:18) different, right? They have different strengths, different weaknesses, both unique, bring to the table, blah blah blah. Yeah.
(13:23) If you take away those strengths and those weaknesses that women provide, you are making it you are handicapping
(13:30) yourself to the point where society can no longer progress in a positive manner. You just keep stating that that's not a
(13:36) demonstration. Like here, I'll give you a demonstration. I'll get I'll give you a logical demonstration. Now is one group of people. You're
(13:43) lacking diversity. Societyy's not going to be able. So what you don't need to have a diversity to have a progressing society. That's insane. And not only that, let's
(13:49) point this out. Hey, let's point this out. You are just, you just continuously restate that if we pulled back, if
(13:56) society regressed because you no longer had women's empathy in the workforce or something, all progression, all social
(14:02) progression of society would just halt. That's the part you haven't demonstrated. I have no reason to
(14:07) believe that men would be unable to make scientific discovery, make inventions,
(14:12) uh, uh, continuously make progress in markets, make progress when it came to all sorts of scientific pursuits. I have
(14:19) no reason at all. You've provided zero reason why I should believe that without women around, women could or men could
(14:26) not do these things anymore if women were just loized. Yeah. Because I think men and women
(14:32) complement each other, like I said, um with their positives and their negatives. I think that if you take away
(14:37) an entire group of people and you just leave, um a bunch of the same people in a group together, um I think that
(14:42) there's going to be, especially with men, um a lot of fighting, a lot of disputes, a lot of problems. And I think
(14:48) that just putting men together in one big group uh is going to hinder the progress of society. And without another
(14:53) uh h now you're saying a different thing. Before you said it's impossible for society to progress. Now you're just
(14:59) saying, "Oh, it would hinder it." It's like, "Okay, so I want you to actually actually answer to what I asked you,
(15:06) which is this. Why should I believe that if women were completely lobtomized, looking at history and seeing how women
(15:12) had no rights anywhere and were basically looked at as as property, but still somehow we had philosophy,
(15:18) science, economics, all sorts of social pursuits, all sorts of uh modernism
(15:24) which came out of industrialization before women had a single right. Right. Why should I believe that if women were
(15:30) lobbomized, suddenly all progress in those domains would just halt because we
(15:35) don't have enough empathy no more? That's what I want an answer to. Yeah. I mean, obviously, it's beyond
(15:41) empathy, right? Um but yeah, like I said, and I think you also agree with me that there would be um severe regression
(15:47) within society if we did this. I'm saying that um
(15:52) and prevent like prevention, right? things that hinder progress. I think that it would hinder it to an extent that society would not be able to
(15:58) progress. That's not telling me anything though. Why should I believe that science Why would science stop? Why would science
(16:04) stop? Why would men stop suddenly going, "Oh, we're not going to do science anymore because we don't have chicks
(16:09) around to bang." Can you explain that to me? So, obviously that's not what I'm saying right now.
(16:14) Yeah. Why would science stop? I don't think science would have the ability to continue if society crumbles.
(16:20) Philosophy. Would philosophy continue? Uh, sure.
(16:26) Okay. So, would and would academic pursuits continue? Would industry continue? Would all these things
(16:31) continue? Uh, I don't I don't think so. Okay. Why? Yeah. But you see how you
(16:36) just say you just keep saying, "Oh, I'm incredulous, but you but you can't tell me you can't actually tell me the process in which you're incredulous. You
(16:44) you think all these things would continue, but somehow all progress would just stop." The There's no demonstration
(16:49) from your end as to why, though. just incredul. Yeah, I I already explained to you why I
(16:54) think it would stop because you're taking away an entire section, an entire population um that provided valuable
(17:00) things to society. Um and now you're just left with one group of people. There's no diversity within this group
(17:07) of people in terms of of the differences between men and women. Um you're taking away very valuable members of two very
(17:14) important industries. Um, and I think that in terms of education, which is an industry that's dominated by women, and
(17:21) health care, which very specifically nursing is dominated by women, those two industries have the power to impact all
(17:27) other industries um to the point where society would not be able to progress.
(17:32) Yeah. But no, it wouldn't. First of all, no, it wouldn't. If you took all women out of healthcare tomorrow, right, why
(17:40) should why in the world would I believe for a second that doctors wouldn't still be doctoring, right? that nurses wages
(17:46) wouldn't height or heighten and increase in order to incentivize men to go into nursing. Why in the world would I
(17:51) believe for a second if you took 50% of the the necessary people for healthcare because they're lobbomized from doing
(17:56) bad habits, right? That suddenly these industries wouldn't actually soar. Why is it that I should believe that all
(18:02) pursuits in all academics, science, philosophy, everything else suddenly halt because women are lobbomized? You
(18:08) say, "Well, because there's not enough diversity." Well, like what what are all the philosophical pursuits of women and
(18:14) the scientific pursuits of women? What diversity did we need for 2,000 years
(18:19) with the contributions of women for the progression of society? Can you explain that to me? Well, that's the diversity we needed to
(18:25) get to where we are today. I think it would be incredibly different if women didn't contribute in the meaningful ways that they did. I mean, if you enjoyed
(18:31) society 100 years ago, that's great. But I enjoyed the society I'm in right now. How do you know? That's a presentism
(18:36) fallacy. You don't even know that. You don't know that. You have no frame of reference for that. The society I'm in right now versus the
(18:42) society. If you were to map all technology that's currently available to you into the social dynamic of 100 years ago, you
(18:48) have no idea which society you would enjoy more. This is a theory of presentism based on a modernistic
(18:54) outlook of access to technology, not necessarily when it comes to rights and
(18:59) things like that between men and women. Liberals do this often. They they conflate these two categories because
(19:05) they're silly. But you I just want to point this out to you that you have now
(19:10) a half a dozen times been completely unable to back up with any historic standard how progress stopped when women
(19:16) were secondass citizens. It didn't. Uh or how progress would stop if women were just uh basically [ __ ] machines for men
(19:23) and we did what we wanted with them and we still continued all other processes in life. How exactly does that stop all
(19:31) progress? That's just insane. I already explained to you how I think
(19:36) that would be the case. I don't know if you want me to say it a 12th time. Yeah, but you just keep restating as though it's factual. Based on what, but
(19:43) like what could you ever base this on? I have 2,000 years of history showing women as secondass property of men. And
(19:51) literally progress not only didn't stop, but it led to industrialization. It led to the field of science. It led
(19:59) to philosophy. It led to all of these things which were the u massive technologies and innovations of men even
(20:06) as women were not able to be involved at all. Why should I believe that that stops? Because suddenly you guys are
(20:11) lobomized and you're just baby making factories. That's that's crazy to me.
(20:17) Like I said, society today is different than it was 100 years ago. Um, I don't think that it's it's comparable to to
(20:23) compare the technological process or like the innovations that we created 100 years ago versus the innovations that we
(20:29) required to society today. I think Yeah, they were harder 100 years ago. They were way harder. What do you mean?
(20:37) I think it's harder to progress today than it is 100 years ago. What do you mean? How? So, it was Listen, it was way harder. The workload
(20:43) that men had to do 100, 200, 300 years ago for societal progression was a was
(20:48) like a hundreds of times harder. You know, they had to pound things with a black with an anvil and a hammer in
(20:55) order to, you know, in order to to uh uh you know, pound out swords and uh musketss and
(21:02) things like that. They didn't have electricity. They had none of these modern conveniences. It's like right now
(21:08) uh men having progression in the sciences would be easier than it's ever been ever in history. Why would it be?
(21:14) Why would why would women be some necessary component to this? No, I I completely I completely disagree
(21:21) with that. You think that progression's easier now? I think that like we have microscopes and we have
(21:27) electricity and we have ways that we can look at germ theory and we we have all sorts of things we never had. Of course,
(21:34) it's way easier now than it's ever been. Yeah. So, we have technology, right? Just how 100 years ago we had different
(21:40) kinds of technology to discover different things, right? So, now we have better technology to discover things that would be uh just impossible 100
(21:49) years ago. Yeah. But that makes my point for me and yes, discovery discovery has become way
(21:55) easier for people uh especially with the advent of things like electricity and cars. Just cars, just the vehicle makes
(22:01) scientific pursuits a million times easier. Just being able to drive from point A to point B without having to
(22:08) ride horse for 4 days makes scientific discovery easier. Almost every aspect of
(22:13) life makes is easier now. Complex things. You're not disco you're not reinventing the wheel again, right?
(22:18) You're curing cancer now, right? So, no, you're not just curing cancer. You're looking for other planets. You're
(22:24) discovering new philosophies. You're you're honing in on different forms of germs. You're mapping out genomes.
(22:30) You're studying taxonomy. You're doing all sorts of things, not just curing cancer.
(22:36) Yeah, I know. It's not just curing cancer. Yeah, but you went for like the hardest thing you could think of to make your point. And it was a silly point.
(22:43) I mean, I think it's still incredibly difficult to make it to Jupiter, but that's not something we could even fathom doing 100 years ago. But we have
(22:48) the technology now, but it's still incredibly difficult, probably comparably difficult, um, arguably more
(22:54) difficult than inventing the wheel. Um, so the wheel, we didn't invent the wheel a
(23:00) 100 years ago. We're talking about a distinction technology of industrialization. I'm pointing out to
(23:05) you that scientific pursuits right now. And even if it was the case, let's just grant it just for the sake of argument
(23:10) that it was harder to make scientific or easier to make scientific discoveries 300 years ago than it is in modernity.
(23:17) That still has no answer for why it is that men need women. why it is that if they were all the bottomized and set in
(23:23) secondass status that the society wouldn't continue to thrive and men wouldn't socially still pursue all of
(23:28) these academic fields and we wouldn't still continue to make progress. All that you say is well I'm just
(23:33) incredulous cuz something about empathy. It's not just about empathy. I think
(23:38) you're being disingenuous. Um so like I said women and men are different. They have different strengths and weaknesses.
(23:44) Women bring extremely valuable things to the table. They've contributed very val valuably to society. If you were to take
(23:50) that away, society would regress. Um, and then we're talking about a society of only men and men participating, which
(23:56) has its own problems like interconlict, etc. Women are lobbomized. Why do you think interconlict leaves?
(24:01) Because women are involved. That's insane. That's silly. Women can vote. So women women right now are 50. They're
(24:09) 50% of the voting block in Western nations. They can vote to send men off to wars that they don't even have to go
(24:14) fight because they're not eligible for the draft. Why do you think that conflict is suddenly reduced because
(24:20) women are involved? That's not the case. You don't think interpersonal relationships with the opposite sex that
(24:26) you're attracted to doesn't reduce things such as like interpersonal conflicts? No, it creates interpersonal conflict.
(24:31) What do you mean? Like are you saying the opposite sex? Yeah. The opp Yes. Yes. Interactions
(24:37) with the opposite sex tend to create interpersonal conflict. Yes. Yes. Yeah. I think that
(24:43) Yeah. Women are assisting men with things such as like reducing violence etc. Right. With interpersonal
(24:49) interpersonal relation. Yeah. Against who though? Women. Right. Right. So when you talk about violence
(24:56) reduction, isn't it really that the most amount of reduction that women want violence from men is against women.
(25:02) Right. But if we took that off the table because now women are just labmomized sex objects. Why would we care about
(25:07) violence? Men love violence. They think it's great. Yeah. Just because men love violence doesn't mean it's beneficial to society.
(25:13) And societyy's going to progress. It doesn't mean it's bad for society either. Boxing is great for society. UFC is great for society. Sports fighting is
(25:20) great for society. Organized sports great for society. Duel, by the way, dueling I would argue
(25:25) dueling is good for society. Dueling is good for society. Sure. Okay.
(25:30) Yeah. What's wrong? What's wrong with the fact that if you have your honor slighted and you were say to call a person out to a duel and one person died
(25:37) as a result of the duel, don't you think less people would be involved in sliding other people's honor? Don't you think that would make for a better society?
(25:45) No. Well, then I got to ask you, why was there so such a gentleman's code just a couple hundred years ago uh where it was
(25:52) the case that male-on-male violence was so low inside of Western nations, especially among gentlemen, where they
(25:58) would call each other out to dus. is because if you did you got slighted you might run the risk of well you know
(26:04) dying right uh I don't know much about the history
(26:10) of of duels or anything else is or yeah right anything else um I do
(26:17) know that uh a progressive good society at least in my eyes is not one where you can just I don't know you're working in
(26:23) the office and your coworker says that you're fat and then you just challenge him to a duel and unalive him I don't
(26:29) see how that could be that's actually why why don't you see that that's that's good. The idea here
(26:34) is if you wanted to have a reduction in uh people doing honorific slights to you
(26:39) if there was repercussions which could potentially cost them their lives or not. They could always turn the duel
(26:45) down. It just really hurts their honor, right? It just hurts their honor. I think that could that could u end up
(26:51) being a little bit of a slippery slope, don't you think? in terms of subjective subjective ideas of what's an honor
(26:56) slight. Um, what's stopping you from just pulling out a pew pew and shooting a guy that says that you your pants
(27:02) don't look good today? Yeah. So, when you talk about when you talk about hang on murder itself, murder
(27:08) itself, the idea of murder itself is subjective, right? The idea of what that is, whether it's defensive or
(27:14) non-defensive or justified, even that is subjective. So, you're just saying, well, honor be subjective. It's like, so
(27:20) everything in your postmodernist progressive fanfiction of society is all subjective. Who cares? Why is that a
(27:26) problem? Yeah, subjectivity when it comes to honor duels is important because it's a
(27:32) slippery slope to things just like unaligning people just because you felt like your honor was, I don't know,
(27:38) disrespected. Um, are you are you saying there's going to be some sort of like legality behind it?
(27:43) Of course, there always was. There was there are certain ways in which duels sure there's certain ways in which duels
(27:50) were to be uh conducted so that they were fair. They had to be witnessed, right? This type of thing. But slight to
(27:56) people's honor. Well, that went down. Oh, hey, you're tired of fat shaming. You're tired of all this type of stuff.
(28:02) Guess what? I bet if people could call somebody else out for a duel, those things would greatly decrease. Greatly,
(28:08) greatly decrease. But not only that, leaving that alone for just a second. I just want to know this. Okay.
(28:14) I just want to know this, right? You would lose. But I just want to know this. Uh you still have not it's a it's a
(28:21) joke. It was a joke, lady. I'm joking with you. Uh you still have not actually Just so you know, all that you said is
(28:26) this. I believe that there'd be such a regression in society that society would never socially recover from this. But
(28:32) you didn't actually make the case for why we needed women. Because if it's the case that society would then begin to
(28:38) progress just in a different way, it sounds like you're just making a case that the society that you want just
(28:44) looks different. Not that it even looks better. Um,
(28:52) no, I don't think I don't think that it would be a better society if women were lobotomized. Um, and I think that
(28:58) Well, not for women. It wouldn't be better society for them, right? And I'm not even looking at it like
(29:04) that. I'm just like looking at it from an outsider perspective if I was just like a like a spirit looking in on this
(29:10) society, not even from the perspective as a woman. But I I couldn't see how society would be better with just men.
(29:17) Well, the the argument actually is not whether or not society would be better. The argument is whether or not women are
(29:23) necessary for the progression of society. And the answer over and over again from you has basically been no.
(29:29) that if it were the case we loized all women that men would still be able to pursue all of these scientific things,
(29:36) we'd be able to reproduce this way, pursue all the same scientific pursuits, still pursue philosophy, still pursue
(29:41) technology, and you haven't demonstrated we would have a bar from any of those things. None. What would be the bar?
(29:49) I I've already demonstrated uh my thoughts. I've already explained to you how Yeah. What would be the bar? Just tell
(29:54) me in simple language. What would be the bar for men continuing to do all of those things even with women
(30:00) lobotomized? What would be the bar? Why why is it that they could not do that anymore? Regress to the point where we wouldn't
(30:05) even be thinking about those things, right? Society would regress to a point um where we're not capable of focusing
(30:11) on things, right? The healthcare industry would be basically I I won't say destroyed, but regress to the point
(30:16) of like dire straits um more than it was in countries for like postworld wars where they had no
(30:23) hospitals. the whole things were destroyed. I mean, come on. About society today, right? So, society
(30:29) today, the way that today's society is structured, what society is used to um I
(30:34) don't know what would happen if we entered a world war today. I'm saying um what we have right now, if women were to
(30:42) be lobbomized, yeah, it would be detrimental to the healthcare and education industry.
(30:47) Um that's true. I I can concede it would be detrimental. And I think it would be to the point
(30:53) where society would regress. That's what I need demonstrated. I need the to the point that men could no
(30:58) longer pursue and fix all these problems, nor do academic pursuits towards progress. I can concede a minor
(31:06) point that you would have instant regression from your standard. But I can't concede the point that that would
(31:11) be necessary. It seems like all you haven't actually told me why even after
(31:16) this big regression happens, men can't go, "Oh, okay. Well, we'll go ahead and fix those problems and we'll just
(31:22) continue to progress in science and philosophy and all these other different things like they do and have done for
(31:27) 2,000 years. Um
(31:34) I I don't know. I just think I I think it's it's opinion based in my opinion. I
(31:39) just I don't think that it's possible to eliminate um the entire second half of the I mean basically eliminate the the
(31:45) entire second half of the population um and then just have like this cute little
(31:50) recovery period and then keep going. Well, I guess I guess if it's opinion
(31:55) based um I mean but you have seen how it's possible. You you yourself have conceded multiple times that it's not
(32:02) only would this happen. It's the most likely thing that happen. Yeah. Why? Well, yeah. I can show you
(32:08) societies where they're secondass citizens right this second. Have no rights, no nothing. They might as well be lobbomized. Are you saying all
(32:14) scientific progress in those societies are gone? Cuz they're not. Well, no. They're not basically
(32:20) lobomized. They're still contributing to society, right? Yeah. You can contribute to society if
(32:26) you're lobomized. You can you can lift boxes and [ __ ] I guess you could lift boxes from point A to point B, right?
(32:33) What do you think these women in these countries are doing? They got working hard, laborious jobs. No, of course not.
(32:39) Of course not. So the thing is is like I you wouldn't even need to necessarily lobomize them. You just chain them up if
(32:45) you wanted to, right? You just chain them up. That's it. Right? They're just there for reproduction only like they do
(32:51) in half the world. And you're saying, "How is it in all these other countries where they just chain women up? They're
(32:56) like, hey, you got no rights, no nothing." None of these scientific pursuits have been abandoned. None of the ideas of weaponry have been
(33:02) abandoned. None of the ideas of defense, philosophy, science, none of these things have been abandoned. You're just
(33:08) totally talking out of your ass. Um, well, I don't think that it's
(33:13) entirely fair to say that these countries have like single-handedly done these progressions. I think that a lot of those countries that have women as
(33:18) secondass citizens rely heavily off of like first world countries like the US, etc. for their technology. But
(33:24) well, okay, you're all you're doing there, you're not even making an argument. You're not even saying no,
(33:30) they've abandoned all those pursuits. You're just saying, you're just saying they have they have not only not
(33:35) abandoned those pursuits, but they've not not abandoned them so much that they're stealing technology from other
(33:41) nations cuz that's how much they care about those pursuits. It themselves, right? So they're still pursuing those things.
(33:47) So they're still pursuing those things. Then the society itself is not capable of producing it themselves. Uh what what
(33:54) society is not capable of producing any sort of technology by itself that's
(33:59) maledominated with women who are second-ass citizens? China. Uh China. Is China not capable of
(34:05) technology? Are women secondass citizens in China? Uh I think you better look.
(34:11) More like more like Iran or Afghanistan? Are you Wait, I'm sorry. You think that
(34:16) Iran has no such thing as scientific pursuits because women are second class?
(34:22) They were building a nuke and got bombed for it. Literally what they were doing
(34:27) was pursuing science. Lady, that's what they got bombed for. What are you
(34:32) talking about? Believe that they were actually but that but I mean they were definitely
(34:38) building uh nuclear centrifuges for the purposes of nuclear energy. That's called a scientific pursuit. They were
(34:43) they were they had all their top sc the first thing we did was assassinate their what? Top scientist.
(34:49) their top scientists, right? That's the first thing we did. Huh? Where was their top scientist?
(34:55) In Iran. That's who Israel assassinated. Very first thing they did was assassinate their top scientists working
(35:00) on Iranian centerfuges for the purposes of nuclear energy is what Iran says.
(35:05) Clearly, they're working on innovative technology. They had enriched uranium up to I think it was 35 or 40%. Right,
(35:13) which is way higher than what they needed. That's why they thought that there was a nuke going on there. Clearly all these secondass women who are there
(35:19) did not bar the men from pursuing science. Did they? That's interesting. Where did they get
(35:24) this uh technology from? Where did anybody get it from?
(35:30) I don't know. I'm just wondering where Iran do you think that I'm Where did Russia get it from? Where did
(35:35) China get it from? Where did India get it from? Where did Pakistan get it from? Where did Israel get it from? You're
(35:40) making an argument. You're making an argument for the source being one source. Does that just mean then that uh it's due to the fact that
(35:48) we have free women that we were able to make a nuke as though the the nuke wasn't being made in the ' 40s when
(35:54) women were still very they couldn't even have a credit card? You know what I mean? What do you mean? Women were still contributing to society
(36:01) even when they didn't necessarily have the same rights they have today. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Sure. They were
(36:07) contributing to society. has nothing to do with the fact that absent women that if it were the case that women were all
(36:12) secondass citizens and were all chained in like little cages for reproduction and that's it that all of these academic
(36:18) pursuits would fail or that society would collapse in any way. You've you've not demonstrated that one iota. He just
(36:24) said, "Well, it's my opinion that it would regress so much that somehow all all of society would collapse and men
(36:31) would just be completely incapable without women's uh benevolent guidance of empathy and showing them how to
(36:37) pursue the very same academic pursuits that they're already pursuing." It's a big brain argument from you, I must
(36:44) admit. Thank you. Yeah, you did. You did well. I appreciate the convo, though. You were
(36:49) very, very kind. It was a very spirited debate back and forth, and I wish you a good day. Thank you, Andrew. Have a good day.
(36:55) You too, Drew. Have a good day. You, too. Time for the cope.
(37:01) Time for the cope, baby. Time for the cope.
(37:07) [Applause] Anyways. Oh, yeah. World view.
(37:13) Who's next?
(37:18) Roxy wants to be let up. Are you in the request? See you. Where's my cope?
(37:26) I want my cope. I want my cope. All the compliments. I appreciate it.
(37:33) Hello, Roxy. I can't stand that stupid [ __ ]
(37:38) Seriously, I can't. The laughing like just the idea of of of labbotomy like
(37:45) the the society could not move forward without women reproducing.
(37:51) reproduce. He was proposing that we we reproduce with the labbotomized women.
(37:57) Yeah. Okay. Well, I'd rather lobomize men cuz they're the they're the ones that have ruined society and the
(38:03) country. Yeah. Yeah. It is men. Men who are the
(38:09) aggressors, men on men violence.
(38:15) Like I I don't know where he gets the audac. This is what smuggness looks like, ladies and gentlemen. smugness. This is
(38:21) what it looks like. Yeah, I'll drink it because like men like him are idiots and they get these
(38:27) platforms and they spew such [ __ ] that it's impossible just even to show
(38:34) them how dumb they are. Wait, actually, that does bring up a good question. I
(38:40) don't know if he's still here. I do have a a a genuine question for him. You had your chance. I don't know if you had your chance.
(38:46) Um you had your chance. Um, I wonder what he thinks of like the ethics of
(38:51) reproduction with lobotomized women. Like does he think that that's ethical? Is that something that he would want?
(38:59) I don't know if by saying it out loud, he thinks that it's a that that it would be uh good for society, but like like
(39:07) there's so many things like who held up the [ __ ] country while men were in World War II,
(39:14) right? Who held up the society? It was women, you dumb [ __ ] It was women.
(39:21) Women held up the collecting the silver to make them.
(39:26) Just chill. He's He's back. Did Did they Did they Did women hold up society when they were putting screws in
(39:32) a pack? They were putting screws in packs. They were holding up society.
(39:38) I don't want it I don't want it to be like that. What do you do you think like that would be like what do you think of
(39:43) like reproducing with labized women? Well, you're talking about Yeah. Yeah. So, you're talking about now normative
(39:49) ethics. So, I'm a Christian ethicist, but what I was delivering was a hypothetical based on your worldview
(39:54) that men need women and giving an internal critique to that worldview. It does not represent in any way what I
(40:00) consider to be righteous normative ethics. Of course that would be uh unholy, ungodly, uh horrific and every
(40:08) other kind of like uh nefarious thing you can attach to it. But ultimately that has nothing to do uh with this
(40:15) position of the necessity of the thing which is your position. That's why now it's funny you understood that credit to
(40:22) you right that you can understand how to have arguments inside of a hypothetical devoid of these kind of like um
(40:29) emotionally charged claim. The chick who came in could not. She actually attributed all of those positions to me
(40:36) as though I hold them as a normative ethical system because she's really stupid and I just wanted to let you know
(40:42) that. Do you want me to bring Do you want to talk to her? Sure. All right. All right. Where is she? No,
(40:50) but I did want to clarify that because I I think if you obviously if you find that to be unethical, you'd obviously
(40:55) understand that we should never have a society where that's the case anyways. Um, Roxy, are you here? Oh, yep. She's
(41:02) here. Sorry. So, but in my view, if you are proposing
(41:08) such nonsense, then somewhere in your mind, you hold that view. Oh, I see. How would you feel if you
(41:14) hadn't eaten breakfast this morning? Hungry. Okay. I just wanted to make sure that
(41:20) you could actually maintain in your head a hypothetical. If I'm doing an internal criticism of somebody's worldview, what
(41:26) does it have to do with me having those positions? Okay. Because her because you you I don't really feel that you're
(41:32) critiquing her worldview. Oh, really? She's saying I mean she first of all she also holds lives where she says the
(41:40) opposite. Okay. That women need men, right? So what what what she proposes to
(41:46) everybody is that for our society to flourish, right, as a whole
(41:52) that it it needs both men and women. Yeah. So what? Right. So,
(41:57) so I think that your the view that you're pointing out in this one particular case doesn't hold to what she
(42:05) believes. That has nothing to do with anything you just said. If I'm crit doing an internal critique on somebody's logical position
(42:11) for the necessity of X thing, why would that facilitate that? That is my view.
(42:16) dance. Because you're allowing
(42:21) because you're allowing for things that would destroy society. And
(42:26) I'm not allowing for anything. It's a hypothetical argument based on a worldview within her.
(42:32) I didn't propose anything, do I'm giving a hypothetical based on her position.
(42:40) No, I'm giving Listen. Okay. Let me ask you, let me ask you a question. Uh if it
(42:46) was the case, if it was the case that right this second there was two buttons in front of you. The first button you
(42:52) could push and Yeah. Yeah. And all women all women.
(42:57) Are you going to let me Are you going to let me ask the question? No. Why is you're not going to let me ask the question? Yeah.
(43:03) You're not going to let me ask the question. You're scared. You're scared. Okay. So, the first the first button you push
(43:09) and women will live the most luxurious life that they've ever lived and ever will live. All women collectively on
(43:14) planet Earth if you push button one. They're fine, luxurious, whatever it is that they ever wanted and
(43:19) their standard of living would be higher than it's ever been. Find the want. Uh they desire it.
(43:27) Yeah. So anyway, they get all that. That's button one. Okay. Then button two, they get less than that, right?
(43:35) Maybe half of that. But they have to reproduce and have childbearing pain and this and that. And reproduction is a
(43:41) duty to society. So they that not every woman has to do it but society moves towards that like it's a duty right now
(43:48) if you push button one the only caveat is that's the last generation of women which will ever live right but they will
(43:53) have lived the best life they could ever have lived button two women will continue to live but they'll be living
(44:00) in a society in which there's some duty for them to move towards reproduction. Which button would you push?
(44:08) Uh probably button one. Right. Exactly. Why? Because you have an
(44:13) anti-natalist mindset and you think there's no duty that women have towards reproduction. She's an actual
(44:19) complimentarian and you're just a [ __ ] idiot. That's the difference between the two of you. I don't think Yeah.
(44:25) I I I don't think that women women owe anyone children.
(44:31) I didn't say that they owe anybody anything. You're proposing that they would have the responsibility.
(44:37) No. Yeah. They would have a duty towards reproduction. Yes. what your analogy. Yeah, they don't have to reproduce.
(44:43) There would be a duty towards reproduction in society. Meaning that women would be actually glorified for reproduction.
(44:48) Semantics. Yeah. Semantics are important because you're having an argument. Doofus. You have a duty to reproduce.
(44:54) Yes. Not a duty to reproduce. A duty to move towards reproduction. Yeah.
(44:59) Yeah. That's not the same thing. You understand? That's not the same thing. Reproduction is reproducing. No. Yeah. No. I mean, I'm not saying
(45:05) reproduction is not reproducing. I'm saying a duty to move towards a duty for society to move towards X thing is not a
(45:12) duty that each individual needs to do X thing. Dummy,
(45:17) do you do you get it? I'm sorry you don't understand logic. I'm sorry. I think that you do not know how to
(45:25) articulate what you're trying to I just think you're too dumb to understand it. Yeah.
(45:30) There's nothing There's like nothing I can do about that. You're just not smart enough to understand what I'm saying. It's not It's not my fault. It's not
(45:36) your fault. Well, it is your fault. That's true. That's true. We can't all be as smart as you.
(45:43) That's true. I agree. Way above everybody else. Not everybody else. Just you. Proved absolutely nothing.
(45:49) Just you. Well, I proved you're an antiatalist by nature. You proved absolutely nothing. No, I proved you're an anti-natalist, I
(45:56) think. But we'll let the audience decide. That you're just an idiot that wants to lo
(46:01) Oh, got him. Got him. I want to lobomize women. Oh, brilliant argument.
(46:06) Was that's all you can think of, right? No, because I gave a hypothetical in order to test logic. Genius
(46:12) into play is how women were held back and repressed, but they were from they were repressed by men. Men who refused
(46:20) to acknowledge their rights as a person. And and that's the side that you're on.
(46:26) That's the side. Yeah. So what? Yeah. Exactly. So what? Yeah. But what would that what would
(46:32) that have to do with anything? You right. She brought you into this world. Did she not? Would you be here
(46:38) without your mother? I wouldn't be here without my father either. How do you know?
(46:44) Well, because I'm pretty confident that semen is required as part of the reproductive process. I'm pretty
(46:50) confident semen is a necessary requisite for reproduction. Down the block. You never would have
(46:56) known. Oh, I'm sorry. Are you would have known. You're right. You should be praised for your digestion.
(47:01) I know who your mother because your body can just do it. Even know who the father is. Remember that.
(47:07) Okay. Except we have DNA testing. Remember that. Yeah. Now you do what you have 100 years ago.
(47:12) Yeah. So I guess a 100 years ago it was pertinent for men to marry virgins and keep them away from men. Huh?
(47:17) You had nothing. Are you done? Is that everything you
(47:22) wanted? Can reproduce with sperm? And and in today's day and age, you dummies have
(47:29) donated so much so that if I snap my fingers and you disappear tomorrow,
(47:35) women would be able to reproduce for the for centuries to come. You should see how many eggs we have on
(47:40) ice. And the thing is, it's an artificial womb is right around the corner. And to tell you the truth, um, not all
(47:48) eggs can be implanted where they will uh, grow into a
(47:53) Well, this would be a great argument if it wasn't the case that I can look at.
(47:59) Am I am I allowed to respond to any of this or you just going to go on an endless diet? Just an endless diet tribe. Okay. Yeah.
(48:05) So, anyway, uh, half the world right now can impregnate women whether they like it or not. So, I'm just pointing that
(48:11) out. Really? Where is that? Oh, well, let's see. Uh, the entire Middle East. If you look at laws inside of many of the Asian
(48:18) nations, why don't you go to the Middle East? What does that have to do with the point of the argument? What does that have to
(48:23) do with the point of the argument? Men feel the need. Oh my god. Oppressed women because
(48:28) why don't you go to Europe where they have the most progressive feminist laws. Just go to Europe then. Go to You see
(48:34) how dumb that argument is? You're not even You're not even arguing anything. You're just a stupid person. Yeah, I
(48:40) know. You're just a stupid person. even begin to to debate with a [ __ ] You can't lady, you couldn't debate with
(48:46) anybody. I don't know what you're talking about. Debate is not a thing.
(48:51) Excuse for a human. Yeah. Give me more. Come on. Hit me with more. You're a disgusting excuse for a human.
(48:58) Anything else? Your mother should have swallowed. That's it. That's all you got?
(49:04) That's enough. Are you on your period? Is that what the problem is? Yeah.
