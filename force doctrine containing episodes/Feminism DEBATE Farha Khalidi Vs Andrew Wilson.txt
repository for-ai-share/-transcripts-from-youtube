Title: Feminism DEBATE: Farha Khalidi Vs The Crucible

(0:01) all right what up guys we are live apologies for delay we had some tech issues but we are all good now so this

(0:06) is going to be a juicy debate potentially YouTube debate of the century here because we're bringing two totally opposite people together we got

(0:12) Barbara who's definitely much more on the feminist side Andrew who's a hardcore feminist hardcore JW now Andrew

(0:18) who's on the conservative side so we're going to be discussing uh feminism and just uh you know gender Dynamics and

(0:24) stuff like that it's gonna be pre-forming debate um I am going to be enforcing Interruption so if anyone is

(0:31) consistently talking over another person I will mute them and then I will uh you know so there's equal speaking time

(0:36) other than that pretty much anything else is fair game um I think we'll do just a quick opening statement by both parties and they'll

(0:43) just be a free flow so you guys can go back and forth and I will only step in if it's one person is unable to talk so

(0:50) that's the only time I will step in uh okay so yeah so we're gonna be discussing feminism so I know far why

(0:55) don't you start off by saying why you think feminism is a good thing um I mean there's like a million

(1:01) different shades of feminism I think obviously the mainstreamed version of it can uh

(1:06) feel more like virtue signaling than actually having like material consequences in society but I think

(1:12) uh Cardinal reason why feminism in its purest form is good is because it's trying to just reassociate traits that

(1:19) are associated with women with productivity uh because usually when we think of women we think of like agreeableness and a lack of

(1:24) conscientiousness and we think about productivity and like social values we think of more masculine traits so I

(1:29) think feminism is just a good philosophy for trying to just reintroduce feminine

(1:35) virtues and just I don't know give them more credit in society I guess that's

(1:42) the biggest way of putting it okay exactly how we're going to be talking about feminism yet but yeah fair enough

(1:47) Andrew you don't think feminism is a good thing do you I don't uh so here because what Pharaoh

(1:54) just said doesn't actually tell me much I actually went to uh her Instagram to

(2:00) try to figure out what her positions on this were but it just kind of looked like she trolls doesn't that I didn't

(2:05) really see anything as far as feminism went so I I wrote down a few things here so pharah we can go after women's

(2:12) suffrage and women's right to vote why it's bad for democracy or we could do all of women's rights come from men or

(2:18) women are less competent generally in positions of Authority or power women's equality is laughable and absurd we can

(2:24) do Christianity treats women better than secularism Progressive values for women lead to less fulfilling lives for

(2:30) Progressive women on average and if literally none of those sound good then I'd really like to know how you're a

(2:35) feminist do any of those sounds good sounds good too far

(2:41) um I guess we could talk about why you think women's equality is a bad idea in the idea of like

(2:47) what was the thing after that you said Progressive Progressive values for women lead to less fulfilling lives for Progressive

(2:53) women on average yeah we could uh focus on those two

(2:59) okay so you wanna you wanna focus on uh women's equality is laughable and absurd

(3:06) yeah I guess you could let's start off with that and then we can move on to the next one when you guys are done with that so why don't you just give your

(3:12) opening thoughts on that and then we'll get into it yeah so women uh women can't

(3:17) make decisions about their own rights because they can't enforce their own rights so since they have no enforcement

(3:23) mechanism other than men all their rights come from men so they can't actually be equal there's always going

(3:29) to be a differential and that's a necessary biological truth it's not saying that uh women can't be uh equal

(3:37) in the eyes of men as far as um you know if you can't murder room abuse them things like this uh within

(3:45) the commons that you would do with men but there can't actually be egalitarianism it's not it's not even

(3:50) possible because women have no enforcement mechanism so since there's no enforcement mechanism there's there's

(3:56) just it's it's a laughably absurd idea I have no enforcement mechanism because

(4:03) women's rights are legally created by men is that what you mean what do you mean well no they're

(4:09) enforced by men so if so in other words if men collectively tomorrow say you have no rights you don't have any

(4:15) anymore and there's nothing you can do about it there's nothing anybody any woman anywhere can do about it

(4:21) um that that's just the truth of the world uh if men collectively and and we do sometimes men do anyway I'm not I'm

(4:28) not grouping myself as a monolith but men do do this and in some Nations they just say hey women don't have rights and

(4:34) they don't have rights and there's nothing that they can do about it how would that happen in America where

(4:41) we do have democracy and we're not just led by I don't know men using their physical strength to Domino's like how can men

(4:48) tomorrow collectively say you know what like half our population you no longer have rights you're like well if men

(4:53) tomorrow say there's no Democracy in America there's no Democracy in America tomorrow either if men tomorrow say that

(4:58) we're going to have a communist Nation tomorrow there will be a communist Nation as well so if men as far as a

(5:05) monolith go let's say you don't even need 50 100 but let's just say 30

(5:10) something like this say we don't want democracy anymore there isn't going to be a democracy anymore they say they

(5:16) don't want communism there isn't going to be or they want communism that's what it'll be if they say they want socialism that's what it'll be so essentially men

(5:23) are the the holders of what Society is going to look like what the economic status is going to be what everything is

(5:29) going to be because they're the enforcement mechanism okay so if that's true if men are the

(5:34) enforcement mechanism why does that then mean that women's equality is a bad idea well I didn't say it was a bad idea I

(5:41) mean it is but what what my position is is that it's laughable that egalitarianism is even possible because

(5:48) women have no way to enforce their rights they have to use men to enforce their rights so since they have to use men to enforce

(5:55) their rights they don't really have any rights because all the rights come from Men guys one quick thing the whole chat is

(6:01) complaining I don't know which one of you guys is typing but the typing noise is really really loud uh I don't know if yeah I hear it I hear it too I don't

(6:07) know if you can tone down the noise or just uh keep your computer a little bit far away from your phone it's just a lot

(6:12) of people she's on it hang on she's on a cell phone and I'm not typing so far are you using your computer to

(6:19) take notes yeah I'm on my I'm on my phone and computer but oh okay maybe you can just uh like yeah move your computer

(6:25) a little bit further from the phone so the audio doesn't come in okay okay

(6:31) continue oh that's that's the that's my position it's it's absurd to absurds have any

(6:39) belief in egalitarianism on its face because uh it's not actually possible except through the graciousness of of

(6:45) men it's absurd to have egalitarianism because women cannot physically enforce

(6:51) their own rights you mean yeah yeah so egalitarianism is not it's not true it's not real it's false

(6:58) it's only possible through uh men in other words it's not possible through women women can't be equal unless men

(7:05) allow them to be equal which means it's paradoxical because

(7:11) um this means that they're never going to be equal because men are going to always be the Arbiters of what that

(7:17) equality is because women can't enforce it so but why does the notion of

(7:23) egalitarianism have to be predicated on physical strength they're like who gets to enforce it well what else could it be

(7:29) predicated on principles of like what's best for society like what happens if somebody

(7:36) violates those principles like why would it be based off the enforcement what happens if somebody violates those

(7:42) principles what do you mean well so if you have a society in which you have laws in

(7:47) government and things like this and whatever social social contracts you come up with what happens if one side

(7:53) violates those principles or a person or an individual or group violates those principles what would you do with them

(8:00) you would well I would think arrest them maybe or punish them or do something

(8:05) punitive or put them in prison or something like that and so you're right back to the enforcement mechanism again

(8:11) so there's really no way around it the enforcement mechanism is from men will

(8:16) always be from men and so it's paradoxical to say that women can have equal rights because even if they do

(8:22) have equal rights it's just because men have allowed them to

(8:27) but does that make women's equality laughable or like an absurd idea well it's paradoxical on its face so it has

(8:33) to be laughable because there is never going to be such thing as women's equality Just an Illusion thereof

(8:38) because if it's decided by even a small minority majority of men minority

(8:44) majority being like 10 15 20 they just won't have it anymore and there's nothing they can do about it so uh

(8:50) essentially always they have to defer to men for this

(8:56) I guess would you apply the same logic to race like if someone's a racial minority and then a larger racial

(9:01) majority just decides like we're going to overpower you physically and with important mechanisms nope it wouldn't

(9:07) work the same way it would just be the same man Paradox so if men decided to take rights away from a single group of

(9:13) men they could do that yes but let's say if it was a racial

(9:18) minority of women um or something like this that wanted to take away rights or even if it was a

(9:24) racial majority of women who wanted to take away rights from a minority of men they likely couldn't do it

(9:30) without using men as enforcement so it's always it always comes back to this no matter what so it'll be in this

(9:36) particular case if you're talking about race it would be yes groups of men can take away rights for whatever reason based on whatever proxy they have from

(9:43) other men and have always been able to do so okay I guess I just disagree that that

(9:49) makes women's equality laughable because we would need a minute well then explain how you can be equal

(9:57) because I don't think equality is predicated on physical strength I don't think equality is necessarily predicated on whether you're able to enforce it

(10:04) yourself the what's it predicated on what's a right predicated on where do

(10:10) you think a Right comes from absent enforcement of the right

(10:15) I mean conservatives will argue that you know a lot of you know fetuses in the womb have rights

(10:21) even though they can't physically defend themselves if they're still worthy of Human Rights so what you're saying there fend for

(10:27) themselves so does that mean that like you know fetuses shouldn't be deserving of Human Rights if you are pro-life

(10:33) because women could just decide to just abort them like well so this is this is this is question begging right so I'm

(10:40) asking you where do rights come from and you say well conservatives will say that uh children in the womb have rights well

(10:46) that may be true or maybe false but that doesn't actually answer my question which I'm asking you where do you think

(10:52) rights come from well I guess what I'm saying is where they don't come from is physical strength I don't care where they don't come from I want to know

(10:58) where they do come from where do they come from um

(11:04) I guess it's subjective like some people think it comes from just a religious sense of

(11:09) you're a person you're deserving of Human Rights you're deserving of

(11:15) prosperity and happiness or you could argue that I guess it depends what you think are fundamental rights like which

(11:21) right well that's that's the question I'm asking you is if you don't have an explanation or grounding for why you

(11:27) think that people should have rights at all or where rights even come from then what else could they be other than an

(11:32) enforcement mechanism by groups of people for what they think other people should be allowed to do or not do

(11:38) I don't think because I don't have a clean definition of where rights come from that means that I have to just

(11:43) defer that rights should just come from who can physically enforce them where else could they come from then

(11:51) if there's no clean definition it means that tyranny is what dictates rights well no well in your case for democracy

(11:59) you might say it's a tyranny of majority or you could say uh that it's not a tyranny because it's the majority it

(12:05) wouldn't really matter which way you framed it the truth of the matter is though is that you have to at some some

(12:10) point contend with this issue which is if you don't think that there's a grounding for rights and they're just

(12:16) all subjective based on cultures and people groups and things like this all over the world that's fair enough but

(12:22) then you would have to also say in that same breath if they're all just subjective then who's giving them to who

(12:28) and who can take them away from who sure so I guess rights are established

(12:33) within a civilization it's or within a usually within National borders it's decided like what

(12:41) what do people need in order to have a prosperous life or to have like an equal opportunity

(12:48) I'm just saying usually the physical enforcement is there to ensure that like to ensure a bottom line to ensure that

(12:53) people at the bottom even if they're handicapped like I just don't understand why this example is uh you're using it to apply it to women well the Greeks

(13:01) said that uh without law there can be no

(13:06) freedom and what they're saying there is if you don't have an enforcement arm for

(13:11) what keeps you free being like things like a military um things like police things that are

(13:17) enforcement laws in other words uh you can't actually enforce any of these rights how could you how could you

(13:23) possibly do it so since men are the enforcement arm there's really no way

(13:28) out of the fact that you get your rights from them whether you like it or not you could say that egalitarianism is as a

(13:35) principle is great but that really is just begging the question again as to who's giving you your rights you're not

(13:42) giving them to yourself so in other words pharah you didn't wake up one morning with rights of which you gave

(13:47) yourself you have rights which other people allow you to have and can easily

(13:53) take away if they so chose and there wouldn't be anything you could do about it that's my whole point sure your

(13:59) entire neighborhood one day can just decide we hate Andrew he's annoying he's not mowing as long let's go kill him

(14:04) does that mean your rights are lost not if they were women not if they were women they could do that if they were men though I agree I

(14:11) would agree that men could likely 20 women could come and just decide we're gonna overtake Andrew because he's not

(14:17) mowing his lawn I think it would be far more difficult for them to enforce it than 20 men wouldn't you agree

(14:23) and I think that they would probably appeal to men in order to uh exercise the enforcement which is what they do

(14:29) right now which is what women do right now they they appeal to men to exercise all enforcement of all of their rights

(14:36) and all of the things that they want they can't appeal to women because women can't force their rights and never

(14:42) happen five women or like three women two men come tomorrow kidnap you tie you to a chair and start beating you and I

(14:48) say oh well he can't fight back right now we're the one who decides if he eats or sleeps or gets water does that mean

(14:54) your rights are laughable the basis of your rights are laughable that makes no sense so what's your no no listen listen

(15:02) objective so if I decide hang on hang on a tyrannical situation and torture you actually you're making my point you're

(15:09) making my point for me so if my rights are being violated and I'm unable to physically do something about it so two

(15:15) men and three women have tied me up they're now depriving me of life liberty and Happiness by doing this and I can't

(15:21) physically do something about this who would I appeal to to do something about this

(15:28) if you can't appeal to someone it means the basis of your rights are laughable yeah unless you can tell me what the basis of rights are

(15:35) which is what I've asked you in the beginning the legal basis of your rights yeah I know but what is the the legal

(15:41) basis of the rights come from what in America it comes from the Constitution which came from

(15:49) currently the Constitution will only be amended legally like I don't think men can just

(15:55) overpower that right now really they tried to uh before in the Civil War

(16:01) currently currently what's the difference between between now and then they tried to once before what do you

(16:08) mean so if they don't like if men don't like the hand that they've gotten they don't like the nation that they're in they don't like the government that they

(16:14) have they don't like the circumstances they're in collectively they seem to be able to do something about that they can

(16:19) overthrow the entire nation for instance can you point to a country in history you can ever think of where women have

(16:25) collectively overthrown the nation with Force

(16:32) okay so by enforcement mechanism you don't mean through like legal or civil measures you mean through like

(16:38) Revolution and those are both physical measures a legal measure is a physical

(16:43) enforcement how else could it how how else could it work like what would what

(16:49) stops you from breaking the law it's a penalty right doesn't somebody enforce the penalty

(16:55) I'm just saying revolutions could be spearheaded by anyone I just don't understand why this is like such a gendered idea for you that like women's

(17:02) rights are laughable because a majority could overtake them like that's the case with any larger group of people it's not

(17:10) the case so for instance let's say you had a dynamic where you had 20 percent men to a 80 female ratio the men would

(17:19) still be in charge we know this that's true well not only can I demonstrate that this is true by showing you Nations

(17:26) post-war where a lot of the men up to two-thirds in some cases were completely

(17:31) wiped out and the men were still in charge the reason is because even then

(17:37) the power Dynamic is so it's sloped uh such in the favor of men that women still need them to enforce their rights

(17:43) women are unable to physically do this type of work themselves at least collectively there might be individual

(17:49) women who are able to be police officers uh great military officials things like this I'm not disagreeing with that I'm

(17:55) talking about on average and in generalities here and in general no women can't enforce rights and have

(18:02) never been able to their rights collectively come from Men okay so women's rights are laughable

(18:08) because men if needed can use enforcement mechanisms whether legally or just purely physically to overpower

(18:14) them our children's rights also then laugh hang on back up because you're well you're actually straw Manning right

(18:20) remember I said the word egalitarianism meaning equality equality is laughable

(18:26) not women's rights not giving rights to women in other words but egalitarianism

(18:31) and equality is laughable because it's paradoxical and the great Paradox of it

(18:36) is that you would be appealing to the same group of people who can then take your rights away while it's a shame time

(18:43) considering yourself equal to those people it's laughable it's a paradox

(18:49) I just don't know if that's a good basis like I don't think you're less than of a human because you are missing a leg or

(18:55) because you're of older age and you probably can't fight back against the younger generation Genji can decide today we're going to kill off Gen X does

(19:02) that mean there's a terrible terrible argument too because I'm not you're

(19:07) again straw Manning I'm not talking about a person who has a disability for instance being a lesser or greater human

(19:13) being that's no there's no that has no merit to the argument yeah I'm saying to

(19:19) you that it's not that women are lesser human beings in fact I consider them the the same as far as

(19:25) um you know how they should be treated uh they should definitely be treated with respect and dignity and all those

(19:32) wonderful things that we would expect in society for everybody to treat everybody that way but that's not going to change

(19:38) the grounding fact that um that their rights come from men and are enforced by men our senior citizens

(19:45) rights laughable is there a quality laughable not not saying that not strong money by saying that you're assuming

(19:50) they're less than is there a quality laughable because they could be physically overpowered by gen Generation

(19:58) Y Generation Z

(20:09) listen you're actually you're you're making a pivotal mistake here if you're saying to me like can men take

(20:17) rights away from other men the answer is yes yes can uh men take rights away from women

(20:24) the answer is yes can women take rights away from Men the answer is no no they

(20:30) can't yes Millennial women can't take away rights from senior citizens no not unless men allow it

(20:38) because if men decide collectively not to allow it there's nothing you can do in other words you can never decide to

(20:45) take a right away from an older generation co-gendered like I sort of wear this like yes men can still take

(20:50) rights away from men this has been established 50 times but women can't take the rights away

(20:55) from men that's the problem that you have is that even if all of you collectively came together tomorrow like

(21:01) let me ask you this just reasonably think about this say the entirety of the human race decided one day that they

(21:08) were going to go to war with each other all of the men and all of the women who do you think would win

(21:15) all of the men I'm not disputing the fact that men could overpower women I'm

(21:21) no hang on hang on for the rest of thought exercise pretend for a second the entirety of all of women went to war

(21:28) with 20 of the population of men and all the other men stayed out of it who do

(21:33) you think would win honestly I don't know I think war is

(21:40) more about phys is more is about other things than just physical strength it's about like Weaponry it's about how you

(21:45) can strategize so I I don't know are we are we assuming a world without like

(21:51) modern weapons of modern technology just like kind of even in a world with modern weapons and modern technology

(21:57) okay even then 80 I would honestly in that

(22:02) case I'm being honest I genuinely think women in that case why we're using modern technology yeah so why do you

(22:08) think that women uh who are generally speaking inept with technology generally

(22:14) we're not saying all women but generally speaking they're inept we know this because of who goes into the

(22:20) technological and stem Fields when we have egalitarianism guess who it still is it's men they overwhelmingly are the

(22:28) engineers they are overwhelmingly the people who fix everything in society they're the ones who create and operate

(22:34) that very same technology I don't think that highly specialized Tech like that

(22:39) even then would be something that women could easily deploy against even 20 percent of men you're talking about

(22:45) something here if you scale it up you start to kind of recognize how how lopsided the power Dynamic really is and

(22:53) always will be there's not anything that can be done about it that's what makes this a great Paradox to appeal to men

(22:58) for rights and at the same times say that you're equal to men is laughable sure you didn't say

(23:05) all of women and all of men in this instance use it 80 women 20 men even then yeah even then there could still be

(23:11) even though less women go into stem in that 80 pool there could be more women who are technologically inclined I still

(23:17) think they would lose I still think if you were I still think they would lose but the thing is the point being is is

(23:22) that um even if they wouldn't in that particular case just that one particular

(23:28) case maybe just took 30 percent of men whatever whatever the collective was okay the power Dynamic is ridiculously

(23:36) senior citizens are also technologically inept if you put all of them men can take rights away from menial women

(23:42) against all of senior citizen men I think women would win in terms of

(23:47) warfare technologically okay only okay listen listen hang on hang on a little

(23:53) finish yeah but she's straw Manning the entire thing I don't know doesn't understand it she's not interrupting you just just just just let her friends

(24:00) okay listen you're straw Manning their position I think you don't understand it you can have great monoliths of One

(24:06) Versus the other and possibly overwhelm them that's really not the point it's that if women were to all the millennial

(24:12) women were to decide tomorrow that the senior citizens needed to lose all their rights they would still have to appeal

(24:18) to men in order to allow that to happen so if all the other men were like nope they still have rights women still

(24:25) couldn't do anything that's my point while we have to kill some thought experiment involved Warfare

(24:31) if you're at War who are you appealing to you're just again you're a technological or whatever the dispers the the uh

(24:39) disbursement is okay let's say it's like 200 to one right so men can take out

(24:45) like 20 women to one woman it's fine or let's just say it's two to two two to one it doesn't really matter right what

(24:51) I'm saying is is that as long as men are involved in governance as long as men are involved in society you and your

(24:59) rights and your appeals to take rights away or give rights to any group of people at any time has to necessarily be

(25:06) an appeal to men so even within the confines of the thought experiment if we took all of that out who I could just

(25:11) yield the entire thing to you and say sure maybe in that instance I'll just give it to you it just doesn't really

(25:17) matter though I'm not refuting that you have to appeal to other people fear of Rights I'm

(25:22) refuting that that appeal means that your equality is laughable same way you

(25:27) probably wouldn't argue that just because of senior citizen again has to appeal to the general public most of whom are younger most of whom are more

(25:33) technologically inclined than them like I said even a millennial woman is more technologically inclined than a senior citizen man probably at this point that

(25:38) doesn't mean their equality is laughable listen the senior citizens who are men

(25:46) understand just like all men do that other men are in a position to take

(25:51) their rights away anytime they choose unless you have some type of collective that can stop that that's why we have a

(25:58) military that's why we have all these different things to enforce the rights this is well understood

(26:05) you claiming wait a second what if a bunch of women got together to take the

(26:10) rights away from senior citizens well they could do that but you would have to

(26:15) bank on all of the other men outside of that external to that allowing you to do that because if they said no you

(26:21) couldn't whereas if the roles were reversed and a group of men were to

(26:27) decide to do that they could and if you opposed it you couldn't stop it that's

(26:32) the difference okay I still don't see the equivalency

(26:39) between needing to appeal to majority and meaning that your rights are laughable but I guess if your basis of

(26:45) Rights is based off physical enforcement then no listen this is fundamental and

(26:51) pivotal to any argument you'll ever make in your entire life all of your rights

(26:56) are based on enforcement unless you can give me a basis for them outside of that

(27:03) that just can't be the case because the notion of Rights wouldn't need to exist we wouldn't need to establish rights for

(27:09) people if each person could physically enforce it themselves the whole point of establishing Baseline of Rights is

(27:14) because you're assuming people are fundamentally different physically and intellectually so how can you say your rights don't matter because you're physically

(27:20) inferior when that differentiation is what justifies your rights in the first place that's

(27:25) why we even establish rights you haven't Justified rights at all you just say this is what justifies them the fact

(27:31) that there's inferiority between different people okay is that the justification that the justification for

(27:37) rights is based on inferiority is that is that what you're saying is your justification for it

(27:43) right it's a differences the difference is just the justification it was as uh intellectually and physically capable as

(27:50) the person next to them I don't think we would need to establish human rights okay so probably so you think that

(27:56) rights then come from your mind they don't come from any external Source just people make them up

(28:03) what did I what do you mean well I mean if absent something for you to ground this Axiom on some unless that's all it

(28:12) is just like a a pure Axiom to your own preferences you'd have to tell me what

(28:18) you're justifying having a ride on where it comes from where does a right actually come from

(28:24) other than your your mind you made it up if that's the case then you have then you have a big problem so did it did it

(28:30) come out of out of the people's minds or does it come external did they come from God like our our Founders said or where

(28:36) do they come from I'm asking you where do rights come from for you because I'm saying God I think

(28:42) right I think I think that uh well as far as innate human rights the way that

(28:47) you perceive them we don't perceive them the same way but I would say that I would ground I ground all of my

(28:52) epistemology and ontology on my faith so all the things that I think are informed

(28:58) by faith and would be informed by God but from your perspective your secular

(29:03) perspective you're just saying that rights are just something that people made up one day and then you say but

(29:09) enforcement isn't necessary which is really bizarre and makes no sense and I'm trying to get you to square it

(29:14) necessary I said a forcement is crucial to rights then rights come from men if so if enforcement is crucial to them and

(29:21) of the enforcers of those rights not women so therefore you're you're basically begging them for rights what

(29:27) the majority establishes is those rights but I'm saying just because you're rights can be taken away how does that

(29:32) make the basis of equality laughable because it means that you would always be appealing to people who can take your

(29:38) rights away as being equal with you when you can't take theirs away you can take them away but doesn't feel

(29:45) Justified nope you can't take them away men can take them away but not but not women women can't take men's rights away

(29:52) not monolithically if a majority of Voters decide to change the basis of

(29:57) rates again they could take it away from the minority of senior citizens well first of all we're not in a democracy we're in a republic and it takes more

(30:04) than a simple majority of which women do outnumber men but it's only slightly so they would still need even men in that

(30:10) coalition to do so so women as a singular entity can't do anything outside of voting uh but even with

(30:16) voting they would need men but absent voting they certainly can't enforce their rights whereas men can enforce

(30:22) their rights even absent voting so if we don't like what's going on the ballot box or in the nation or in the country we can physically do something about

(30:28) that we can change the regime we can change the president we can change whatever the [ __ ] we want and um Society

(30:35) basically just has to deal with it there's nothing that they can do about it they're at the mercy of men so men

(30:40) are at the mercy of men and women are at the mercy of men but that all of them are appealing to men for rights okay so

(30:46) you said you're a Christian right so you believe in a theological basis for rights so what do UCS rights then since

(30:51) you have a more objective understanding of them

(30:56) um I don't think that we have innate rights the way that you think that we have innate rights

(31:02) I think that we have an obligation and duties to follow certain virtues and

(31:07) that those virtues might oftentimes run contrary to what you might consider an innate human right of which I don't

(31:14) consider an innate human right so examples of this might be I don't know discrimination let's say against

(31:20) transgender people using the bathroom or something like this I don't consider that to be virtuous and so I would be

(31:27) against such a thing even though a person like you might say well wait a second this is a fundamental human right

(31:32) or something like this the difference is is that all of my positions on that are

(31:37) informed and I'm basing all of it grounding all of it on the Bible and on

(31:42) God you're grounding all of everything you believe is right just basically out of your own brain what you think

(31:48) subjectively is a right and what isn't okay so what do you then see as

(31:53) fundamental human rights fundamental I don't think for instance

(31:59) that people have the right to murder other people I don't think they have the right to steal from other people

(32:04) um there's kind of an inexhaustive normative list of things that I think we would likely agree on but on the other

(32:10) hand I don't see egalitarianism as being a fundamental human right never have I

(32:16) think it's like I said in many cases it's laughable like this one I certainly don't see uh only fans as a right I

(32:23) don't see speech as being necessarily a right I don't see any of those types of things as being fundamental to The Human

(32:29) Experience or a human right so I think uh I think you and I would

(32:34) see rights very differently but unless you have a criticism of those things which I'm happy to get into you

(32:41) still are kind of question begging with the with the whole idea that well wait a second no it's the majority that gives

(32:48) rights it's not the majority that gives rights it's men that give rights men are the ones who can bestow them upon you

(32:54) and they're the ones who can take them away we know this because collectively women cannot and have not ever been able

(33:00) to do this ever I was saying that because you were using the thought experiment of Imagine 80

(33:07) percent you're at War and then if 80 of the people at War women and 20 of men who do

(33:13) you think would win and I was saying in that instance I think it's not completely out of the realm of possibility that the women would win but

(33:19) you were just agreeing with that but let's say they did win do women now have a basis for rights

(33:25) if if women were able to physically uh overpower and take their their rights

(33:32) and give them to themselves somehow sure all you have to do is show me where that's ever happened and I'm happy to

(33:38) say hey sometimes they do that but they don't ever do that and have not ever been able to do that and the reason they

(33:44) can't do that is because uh well men are way [ __ ] stronger and way more

(33:50) aggressive and have higher testosterone and it seems to bother them far less to

(33:55) um kill things than it does women so that's why essentially uh women are

(34:00) completely under the thumb of men um and everything outside of that is basically just an illusion it's an

(34:07) illusion that we tell ourselves but you're always appealing to men for your rights there's no way around it

(34:13) okay I guess I'm still trying to wonder why you're only applying this idea that

(34:18) if you can't physically enforce the rights that means it's laughable just to women again if you're not applying it again that's not what I'm saying I'll

(34:25) say it again handicapped maybe I'm missing them I'll say it again say it again pretend for a second that there was a

(34:33) god a God not the God right we'll just pretend that there's a God and the god comes down and says you and

(34:40) I are now equal you can do everything I can do except all the things that you can't do that I can do

(34:47) but we're totally equal would you agree if the God says to you

(34:52) you are now me you and I are now equal you just can't do all the things I can do right I'm gonna make you a God just like

(34:58) me but you can do all the things that I can do except certain things that you can't

(35:04) are you equal with that person or are you not equal with that person or that entity

(35:13) I don't know if having the same strengths again is the basis for rights like I'm saying I

(35:19) think we establish rights because we're accepting that people yeah but just to the thought experiment would you say

(35:24) that you were equal with that being or not no I don't think right you don't you

(35:30) don't think right yeah you don't think that because that would be absurd and laughable and paradoxical

(35:35) that the being who says to you now let's say the being says now all the things I just gave you I can also take away if

(35:41) you displease me but we're equals would you do you think that do you think that uh you would actually be equal with that

(35:48) being or no okay wait so you're saying the idea that women's equality to men is laughable but

(35:53) are you saying the basis of women's rights is laughable or just the equality

(35:59) well I've already said this that I think that women have the same rights as men do uh in this particular case whatever

(36:06) men decide to give them it'd be the same thing that men decide to give other men that's how traditionally it's always

(36:12) been done in every single society that we've ever been in um so I mean nobody nobody in any

(36:18) society that I'm aware of isn't as normative uh frame is able to just like murder women because they want to that's

(36:25) uh that's that's pretty absurd so as far as fundamental rights go because you and

(36:30) I see rights differently yes I think that women would have the same kind of Rights I would Express that men have but

(36:36) it still would be a truism that men are the ones who are granting those rights

(36:42) okay so then to kind of pivot slightly given that like

(36:47) I'm guessing you don't support feminism or do you still support feminism even

(36:52) though you think or you think feminism is useless because well that's why I asked your definition well I didn't really have to ask because

(37:00) you you kind of let me let me know what you thought feminism was in the opening and in the opening what you said that

(37:06) feminism was was a move towards egalitarianism and equality between men and women so if that's the basis of

(37:13) feminism then feminism would indeed be laughable because again you would just be calling this grouping and monolith uh

(37:21) and saying that they have equality with uh the very people they're appealing to for equality who can then take it away

(37:26) whenever they so choose I don't think I gave a sameness definition of feminism at all I didn't

(37:33) say you did and I said you said it was about equality what you said it was about equality yeah

(37:39) that's what Samus feminism is I think I was saying that modern feminism is about not devaluing feminine traits

(37:46) I don't think I said that feminism is about uh propagating that men and women are equal Andrew can I very quickly I

(37:54) want to really quickly clean up your position for the chat because uh Rachel your wife was saying what your position is so I'll make sure this is accurate so

(38:00) you're talking about the uh what is right but what about in terms of R2 do you all do you believe that women ought

(38:06) to have rights rights as well or you're just talking purely about the what is I've already covered that right so yes

(38:13) of course I think that they're they ought to have the same rights okay uh ordinarily that I would describe in a

(38:20) Christian virtue ethic to anybody sure okay God okay cool yeah I don't think that that's um that's in any way

(38:27) contrasted anything I say no I'm just saying that even then that even then

(38:32) I still understand on the is front that those rights whether I think they come

(38:38) from God or not um I still I still believe that men would be the ones who are going to

(38:44) ultimately uh be the enforcement arm for them and the ones who could take them away from me or give them to me whenever

(38:50) they so choose to do so which historically they've done many times

(38:55) okay so if men are the enforcement arm what do you think they ought to be enforcing then

(39:01) like what rights do you think should be taken away from women or do you think you should still extend equal rights to

(39:07) women even though you could theoretically take them away you mean as I'm trying to figure this

(39:13) out what are you what are you asking me I guess I'm asking what your point is like I guess you're saying that men can

(39:19) take my point is that you're not equal to men that women aren't equal to men because you can't force their own rights men have to enforce them for them so

(39:25) they're begging at the altar for men to enforce their rights while at the same time saying that they're equal to men it's absurd they're not equal to men

(39:32) they they're never going to be there's never going to be an egalitarian society because of this one fact that men can

(39:38) collectively whenever they so choose even in a small Collective just snatch your rights away and there's nothing you [ __ ] do about it that's what I'm

(39:44) saying that's why feminism is absurd that's why the girl power shits all [ __ ] absurd it's all stupid it's all

(39:50) [ __ ] makes no sense because you're appealing you're appealing to the people who take your rights away for your

(39:57) rights and saying you're equal with them absurd that's not and if if that's not the position then that's not feminism

(40:02) because that's what feminism is it's a push towards the egalitarian nature of

(40:08) men and women saying they were equal in every way we're almost interchangeable widgets

(40:13) that's that's what it's saying that's what its proposal is I think feminism or at least in like the

(40:19) girl power strand that you were just describing is saying that even though women are physically

(40:25) inferior to men I don't think most women are the average feminist is going to argue that women

(40:31) uh are physically equal to men or could physically overpower a man typically I

(40:36) think they're more so saying that they're uh generally it's intellectually capable

(40:42) obviously in the most extremes I think if you're comparing extremes I think the most intelligent people are men and then

(40:48) also the dumbest people are men but just in general the average pools of men and women are generally equally as smart so

(40:54) I think like the girl power strand of feminism is just saying that women are just capable in the workforce they're

(41:00) just capable of making decisions I so what how does even what you were saying

(41:06) relate to that to those virtues of feminism so this is this is a pivot to kind of a whole

(41:13) different topic which I'm willing to get into but before before I do jump into that with you uh can can you make the

(41:20) concession that women's rights come fundamentally from Men

(41:30) I would make the concession that rights are established by

(41:37) the by the government uh in the nation you

(41:43) live in and then that the government is usually spearheaded by men yeah

(41:50) if you don't that's not what I'm asking can you agree or do you still disagree that your rights women's rights

(41:57) fundamentally come from Men do you agree or disagree with that because if you agree with that you can

(42:04) concede and we can move off of this point

(42:12) yeah yeah hey we can hear you okay I was looking at my phone sorry repeat that one more time I said so

(42:19) again I need to ask you one more time can you make the concession that women's rights come from men if you make that

(42:26) concession and concede that that point we can move on to the next point I don't think I can I think I would I

(42:34) think I I'm not extremely religious so I can't give you like a clean theological basis

(42:39) for rights but I I don't think I would agree with that yeah right but I wish this is why we

(42:46) keep on this wouldn't make that concession right this is why we keep on going round and round on this right because I make an argument you you would

(42:54) end up inevitably agreeing with what I'm saying but you still won't make the concession on the point because it

(43:00) collapses a large portion of your world view this is very common with feminists you see what I'm saying hang on uh who's

(43:07) able to enforce those rights is an equivalent to the basis of those rights so saying just because rights can be

(43:14) violated by men I don't think that means the basis of those rights is male determined does

(43:22) that make sense nope it doesn't it's still you're still within the the realm of the Paradox so let me try this a

(43:28) different way let me try this a different way um this what I'm saying to you the reason I

(43:35) often make this just normative statement to a feminist that their rights are dependent and reliant on men and men's

(43:42) benevolence because if we're malevolent if we're acting in an evil way we tend

(43:48) to subjugate enslave and things like this right but the reason I make this point even

(43:54) even though it's very normative is because I think most people who are rational agents would just have to kind

(44:00) of agree that it's true on its face there's really no way to argue with it but the reason we end up going round and

(44:06) round and round in a circle and you look more and more absurd every time we Circle it again is because you won't

(44:12) concede to it because it collapses a portion of your world view men are the enforcers of your rights not women do

(44:20) you agree or disagree with this statement I agree that your rights can be

(44:26) physically infringed upon but I don't know if that's the same as saying

(44:32) that because it can be infringed upon or violated that means the basis of the right doesn't exist I guess that's my

(44:38) contention well who gives you these rights other than the agents who are enforcing them

(44:43) on your behalf you're not giving them to yourself so you didn't wake up one morning you

(44:48) didn't wake up one morning I guess political rights are given by mental concede on that in terms of Human Rights

(44:54) I guess I would have to probably research more and think about where I think human rights fundamentally come

(44:59) from I guess I do see human rights as slightly different than

(45:05) politically afforded rights okay so where do human rights come from like I said I think I would have to

(45:11) probably give it a lot more thought I think that that's a fair answer so I don't

(45:16) um I don't expect you to have it that's a like that's a difficult question so I think that that's a fair answer uh maybe

(45:22) we can revisit that sometime down the road but uh the second thing uh that you had

(45:28) uh going off of my list here was um Progressive values for women lead to

(45:35) less fulfilling lives for Progressive women on average that was the other one that she took contention with my am I

(45:40) right there or I would just like I guess I'd like to hear you elaborate more on it I've heard conservatives say that uh women

(45:48) fulfilling traditional roles tend to be happier is that kind of the Crux of your argument well it depends on what you mean by a

(45:54) traditional role so I think people get these confused a bit I think that

(45:59) um a lot of times Progressive women are thinking like 1930s or 40s utopian

(46:04) nuclear family Dynamic household Leave it to Beaver style but that's not actually correct we're talking about

(46:10) tradition we're just basically doing everything within the frame of the religious so when we're talking about Progressive

(46:16) values they're all based on secularism so they have nothing to base anything on except their own subjective preferences

(46:22) and so they end up in this kind of Quagmire of contention but if you want to just go off of empirics the mental

(46:30) illness for women is off the charts in comparison to men uh it's in fact even

(46:35) seeking Professionals for women is off the charts in comparison to men so is the rates that they attempt in

(46:41) adolescent suicide in compared to comparatively to men um as the society in other words has

(46:47) become more egalitarian across the board women seem to be suffering more not less in fact there's a paper here which I can

(46:54) link you and this um this paper cites it pretty good it's called an evolutionary

(47:01) I'm sorry it's a uh the Paradox of the um the leadership gaps and the Paradox

(47:08) of the gaps when it comes to mental health and women uh it asks the question how come gains

(47:14) and women's rights haven't made women any happier how come that hasn't actually done anything to produce these

(47:21) happy women that feminism promised us when feminism first began uh through the

(47:28) suffragettes like what's the um you know what's what's what's the aim

(47:34) here what is the aim of feminism if not a happier better Society for women why

(47:39) are they all so [ __ ] miserable the more egalitarian they get

(47:44) um I guess it depends whether you value Hedonism or not I don't know if a lot of people consider happiness and pleasure

(47:50) as like the ultimate goal of life like I think a woman could say maybe I'm

(47:55) happier like less happy in this situation but I don't necessarily regret it I think a lot of people do like

(48:01) pursuing something that gives them a sense of purpose um but I don't know if necessarily a

(48:07) percentage that gives you purpose leads to more pleasure in your life yeah but what would be your explanation for uh

(48:13) women having more trouble with mental health and Reporting in almost every single individual aspect of their life

(48:20) that they're more miserable than when the polls that came before uh pulled

(48:25) them in years past where they're saying that they were much happier and Society had a much larger gap between men and

(48:32) women with what women were allowed to do including things like bank accounts things like this I mean we've definitely

(48:38) come a long way with feminism especially in the last 40 years but the miserable index for women is at an all-time high I

(48:46) I just I can't fathom how that could be possible as we close this Gap if feminism is accomplishing its goal why

(48:52) women are more miserable under it um I don't know if this is necessarily the answer but I would say that if you

(48:58) asked me 10 years ago when I'm like 13 years old if I have anxiety I would say no because

(49:05) I don't really have necessarily the self-understanding of what that means versus if you ask me now I'd say yes I

(49:12) don't think that necessarily means that I have more anxiety or that my life is worse than it was 10 years ago I would say by

(49:17) every metric my life is significantly better and that I'm significantly more fulfilled so I think likewise if women

(49:24) are kind of relegated to the household into traditional roles and they're kind of isolated and they only they can't

(49:30) really A B test what life is like outside of it then I think it's easier to

(49:35) dismiss negative feelings like I think you need to have um so wait hang on I just want to make sure

(49:42) I got this right I want to make sure I got this right I want you to understand that the argument you just made was you said it's

(49:49) because those dumb Housewives haven't experienced anything outside of being dumb Housewives so basically it's

(49:55) Blissful in their ignorance that's what you're saying um I don't know if I would say dumb I

(50:02) would say sometimes hmm

(50:07) for instance I think they uh I saw a statistic that says in some countries like in uh less developed countries

(50:15) people there also report more happiness but I don't think the

(50:21) average Western person would say that they have a better life necessarily

(50:27) like I think we could look at them and say okay there are ways in which they have no problems in some ways a lower quality of life right so that's why I

(50:34) don't know if just the self-reporting on happiness is a good enough indication well no that wouldn't be but I have the

(50:41) information right here more than a quarter of American women 26 percent take drugs which include antidepressants

(50:48) 26 percent that more than a quarter of all women take antidepressants

(50:55) what is it what is it 26. what's that what is that number for men just so we

(51:01) have a comparison varies between 12 to 15 percent okay got it so it's much lower okay much much lower same thing

(51:08) with antipsychotics okay women aren't doing so hot and all this egalitarianism

(51:13) that you've been pushing for that has been going Full Throttle you've been getting everything that you feminists

(51:19) have wanted and uh when it's delivered unto you you seem to go batshit [ __ ]

(51:24) crazy isn't that weird isn't that odd to you

(51:29) I think the number of people on antidepressants has gone up in general even for men right slightly yes but the deviation between

(51:37) men and women uh male usage of antidepressants too I

(51:44) would say it's due to male oppression the fact that men have been systematically oppressed inside of the

(51:50) United States under these horrific egalitarian laws where we don't have

(51:55) egalitarianism at all but rather we get raped in divorce courts the laws are

(52:00) fundamentally unfair and for the same crime that a woman is charged with men are unfairly punished the suicide rates

(52:07) if men are Sky High in comparison to women they get the job done it's not that women don't attempt it but it's

(52:12) mostly a cry out for help because they take pills and then they call somebody and say I took some pills come save me they put that up to a suicide attack or

(52:19) as men just get the job done right they just take a gun and that's the way that they end up handling that so all of

(52:26) these things I would say that men are unfairly oppressed in society and that's led to a slight uptick and there seems

(52:32) to be enough correlates there for me me to make such a bold claim but I would like to still know because we seem to

(52:38) just be begging the question why in the world do you think that women who have

(52:44) more egalitarianism now than ever before have more of these gaps closed than ever

(52:49) before are more [ __ ] miserable than ever before wait I first have a question something you said so if men kind of

(52:55) established the framework of Rights and happiness why is it the men are the ones

(53:00) disproportionately uh facing oppression in society well remember what I said earlier that men

(53:06) also oppress men that men are the mechanism for that as well I don't blame

(53:12) women for this that's not the Crux of my argument I still think that men are the

(53:17) responsible party when it comes to the oppression in general of other men but in this particular personally affecting

(53:24) men more than women if men are the ones who are like you said it's not disproportionately affecting women more

(53:30) than it is men it's just that in this particular case when you're talking about the uptick that's the slight uptick in things like suicidality and

(53:37) things like this is because the laws which are on the books tend to favor women because women are a great consumer

(53:44) arm for Corporate America they're in charge of most of the money literally they're in charge of almost all consumer

(53:50) spending so laws are kind of tailored to kiss their ass corporations and lobbyists have gone out of their way

(53:56) under feminism to make sure that women's asses are kissed and Men seem to suffer greatly because of that

(54:03) okay so men create a framework that oppresses men so that they can make more

(54:10) money off female consumer spending is that what I said is that honestly what you think I said I need to know is

(54:17) that honestly what you think I just said I'm asking yeah I know you're asking but you're asking a question that's not in

(54:24) relationship to anything I just said so the question doesn't even make sense so what just happened would be like if I

(54:29) walk over to a guy and I say what color do you want me to paint your fence and he looks at me and he says margarine hat

(54:36) be like what the [ __ ] are you talking about right you might be asking me a question but it's not in relationship to

(54:42) anything I just said so if you if do you want to ask me a question relationship to something I actually said

(54:49) sure can you summarize what your point was then yes my point is that again as countries

(54:57) have become more and more egalitarian under feminism under and this is

(55:02) feminist women and feminist men who are coming together under the same Banner of

(55:08) I heart women's rights it's become more egalitarian why is it that the index for

(55:14) all of these mental illnesses and problems for women are through the roof when feminism made the promise that

(55:20) these things should necessarily decrease

(55:27) feminism made the promise that mental illness for women would go down

(55:35) that the quality of women's life could greatly increase it has not seemingly

(55:40) done that unless you think that a woman's quality of life's not impacted by mental illness which I would say it

(55:46) is especially if 25 are on an antipsychotic antidepressant or some variation thereof

(55:53) I don't know if that's necessarily feminism's fault like you just said we're in a framework in which

(55:58) sometimes laws are created to that like disaffect people mentally like

(56:05) you just pointed to the divorce courts I guess I'm just trying to wonder why are you attributing the uptick in

(56:11) women's mental illness to feminism singularly like how could we don't think it's just an effective just I don't know

(56:17) other consequences because because women are the ones who have pushed and

(56:24) feminist male feminists as well have push-free egalitarianism and across the

(56:29) board in Nations we see that become more egalitarian we see this huge gap increase between men and women when it

(56:37) comes to women a wanting to do things that are more in line with their gender which is a bizarre side effect feminists

(56:43) never want to talk about but also that their state of mental happiness and mental health seems to rapidly

(56:49) deteriorate which is [ __ ] bizarre these are we can link this because we

(56:54) can look at other countries that have way more egalitarianism than even the United States and we see similar numbers

(57:01) yeah I guess I should probably read more about those studies and then we can

(57:07) reconvene at a later time I don't want to okay yeah that's all I I mean that's all I

(57:13) really had to be honest I don't I don't know where we go from there let me uh actually do you mind if I ask you a few

(57:19) questions Andrew and then we can uh move the couple forward so I was as you guys were talking I was just taking some notes there's a few things I wanted to

(57:25) ask you I was researching the whole uh you know like men's happiness woman Staffing what is that [ __ ] clicking

(57:31) dude oh no it's not a Maya are you doing something oh yeah sorry I'm like fishing okay so I

(57:39) was researching and so it seems that the cases that men's and women's happiness have been going down well immense

(57:45) happiness has been going down more so you do have a point there but however what's really interesting is that in the last 10 years actually the happiness of

(57:51) both men and women has gone up right so it was kind of going down down down down down and then started going up so I

(57:57) guess my question would be for you if you know we are more egalitarian now than we were 10 years ago then why is

(58:02) women's happiness actually gone up from what from what to what from what

(58:07) years to which years it starts seems to it's like started going up in like 2010 or something like that right we'll link

(58:14) it over to me because I don't have the data in front of me to look at okay do you want me to just pull it up on the screen yeah well link it to me

(58:21) okay yeah just put in the private chat and then I'll take a look at it okay there's multiple charts you have to

(58:27) look at I'll send you both of them by the way did a decrease again did it go like this in other words

(58:40) you're probably going to come into another downward slope because that's how things like this generally work so

(58:45) you'll see it go like this always on almost every single graph where the happiness index or any index it goes

(58:51) like this Alex it'll start going up then it'll decline it'll go slightly up then it'll decline then it'll go slightly up

(58:58) then it'll decline so the reasons there could be any number of reasons for this including just which

(59:04) poll you're looking at at which time it seems like there is well this only

(59:09) goes up to 2016 so I don't know what happened after 2016. but it seems like there's no decline that I'm seeing on

(59:15) these charts is there like a specific chart that you're referencing that we can take a look at uh yeah I do have some data handy if you

(59:23) want to take a look at it especially on the gender gap in in mental health so just more about like overall happiness

(59:29) baseball gender yeah but my point my point isn't even based around the overarching happiness

(59:35) or overall happiness but whether or not women have gotten more miserable as they become more equal or more egalitarian

(59:42) with men and the appearance is yes and that men themselves seem to do a lot better there seems they seem to be doing

(59:48) even in the worst of circumstances uh better than women who now have better

(59:53) circumstances than they've ever had that's the point regardless of what the external chart even if it showed the happiness index

(1:00:01) going slightly up or slightly increasing I don't even think that that would contend with the point really Alex well

(1:00:06) if if around 2012 Women's happen to start progressively going up wasn't that kind of mute the whole argument no well

(1:00:12) no it still wouldn't uh unless you can point to a bunch of uh feminist uh [ __ ]

(1:00:18) that got passed between 2010 and 2022 that led to massive egalitarianism I

(1:00:24) doubt it oh I don't know I don't think feminism makes women happy and that's not the point I'm arguing I would expect in almost any chart yeah and almost any

(1:00:31) chart that you would look at for a happiness index or drug taking index or anything else it would always there

(1:00:36) would always be a point of decline where it hits bottom and then begins to gradually go up begin to start to

(1:00:41) stabilize and then maybe start another long drop so it's hard to say exactly why that was

(1:00:47) a possibly far you gotta stop typing it's super loud and like the whole chat is going crazy uh do you think that was

(1:00:52) possible that maybe it's a non-secretory meaning there's other things that have caused women's happiness and that's happiness too but to a lesser extent go

(1:00:59) down between like 1950 and 19 2000. do you think there could be anything else I could have done that

(1:01:05) oh there's tons of factors nothing's ever one-sided

(1:01:10) um or has one faucet to it it's probably a multi-faceted issue of course there could be tons of other factors that come

(1:01:16) into play but that still just kind of begs the question for this factor which we do see a high correlation with in

(1:01:23) almost every nation that has feminism and egalitarianism in the first world that as they become more egalitarian

(1:01:30) this bizarre split begins to happen where not only do women start doing more traditionally womanly things when it

(1:01:36) comes to their jobs which is bizarre you would think that they wouldn't but suddenly they don't want to become trash collectors suddenly they don't want to

(1:01:43) become dump truck drivers suddenly they don't want to become electricians they don't want to become any of those things they fought so hard to to become so

(1:01:50) weird but they actually move towards the opposition when they have full egalitarianism interestingly enough

(1:01:56) yeah like intuitively when you first made the argument I was actually like agreeing with you because intuitively it

(1:02:01) makes sense but then when I saw like the data change around 2010 where it started going up that does kind of make me question how important I actually can't

(1:02:08) see this this chart because it just it just gave me an image so yeah it's an

(1:02:13) image yeah yeah but it doesn't actually pull the image up in the URL do you want

(1:02:18) me to just share the screen so you just see it real quick yeah what's it called what's it called

(1:02:24) uh what do you mean what's it called what's the chart called it's called Uh I

(1:02:29) know it's like a women's men's happiness comparison or something like that here I'll just share the screen you can take a look at it okay

(1:02:35) but I still want to I want to look at the source myself to see if there's information you might be not overlooking

(1:02:40) yeah we can do that who the [ __ ] prove that where did you get this this looks like it was drawn by a 12 year old this

(1:02:47) is from Vox oh Vox very Progressive Source box

(1:02:53) I know but you would think that but that's kind of most of the sources I've seen is they're saying that basically something show me another one show me

(1:02:59) another source okay okay that I can actually pull up and so I can look at the data myself

(1:03:05) okay uh one second

(1:03:11) because everything I'm seeing shows that single moms more likely to be in poverty all the risks for fatherlessness kids

(1:03:17) goes up because of that basically all of these things in egalitarian Nations greatly increase this is the UK but I

(1:03:25) think UK is also following the same time come on man what's so bad about give me a chart for

(1:03:30) the United States that's making your point for you so I can look at it don't just make it a chart that doesn't have

(1:03:35) any information because that doesn't help me I can't actually look at anything I can pull up I can pull up the original argument yeah do that

(1:03:44) anxiety the report reveal so okay so where do you want me to go well link the article start with that

(1:03:50) okay so this is this is the charging question here

(1:03:56) both men and one blue orange have increased since the service in 2011 they both have leveled off and grown closer

(1:04:01) together 2015-16 so basically it's saying that in the last decade men and women have been doing no it's not saying

(1:04:07) in the last decade it's saying through the what 2015 and 2016 but where's the

(1:04:13) data after that now at last I checked we're not in 2015 2016. well do you have

(1:04:19) that's why I'm asking you do you have any data about like something more recent because I haven't been able to find it so all I always see is that it

(1:04:25) kind of started going up but like for instance you can intuitively know that this can't be true because just during the lockdowns you would you would see

(1:04:33) something more akin to a dip down right just because of that one factor you would have to see that in modernity so

(1:04:39) and we would have to compensate and account for that as well sure so but no I don't I don't have a chart off the top

(1:04:45) uh or you know like at my disposal any more than you did I didn't know which topic we would actually go with so I

(1:04:51) didn't have it prepped anymore you don't have to get defensive Andrew I'm just bringing up a point I'm not trying to debate you I'm just uh making a point

(1:04:56) you know maybe to get you the question you're not being defensive okay uh I'm responding to what you're saying okay

(1:05:03) the second question I had for you was more of a hypothetical uh I'm just curious to hear what your answer on this

(1:05:08) is if women collectively started taking Mass amounts of steroids and became as strong as men would you then change your

(1:05:13) position on having a legitarian society or no if what now say that again

(1:05:18) hypothetically speaking if woman collectively started taking massive amounts of steroids and became as strong as men would you then change your

(1:05:25) position on the illegalitarian egalitarian society now I think that there's also uh

(1:05:31) intuitive things that men are better at they're naturally better at um and even then I think that men would

(1:05:37) still have an advantage even if the strength somehow in this hypothetical monolithically was equalized I still

(1:05:44) think that men would have an advantage though I would have to rethink the entirety of the position than of where

(1:05:49) rights came from because the advantage would be significantly more limited I would agree that that's true but I still

(1:05:55) think we'd have advantages in other domains okay fair enough all right anyway so let's uh I'll just add those two questions let's just get back to the

(1:06:01) initial debate I don't want to like story like debating myself so um I'm sure you guys have plenty of all their

(1:06:06) points of contention uh what were some of the things that you mentioned you gave me a list of six things in the beginning we did two and three what was

(1:06:13) number one what was number four was number five yeah so the first one is that women's suffrage and the women's right to vote

(1:06:19) has been bad for democracy and bad for women in general do you disagree with Alan Farah oh sorry

(1:06:24) have you muted let me unmute you there we go I wasn't typing by the way I think it's just my

(1:06:31) yeah it was like well as soon as I knew there's a finger chat or I think you got your finger next to your phone tapping

(1:06:36) yeah as soon as I mute you the clicking noise you're good now right now there's no noise

(1:06:41) yeah there is oh yeah there's ah [ __ ] I don't know what it is it's okay you're good yeah

(1:06:48) this is let's just ignore them uh so yeah did you do you agree with what he said or no I'm assuming you

(1:06:53) don't agree with that is that women say it again well with

(1:06:58) suffrage in the women's right to vote has been bad for democracy and women

(1:07:06) disagree I guess if we have these specific topics I guess if we were to talk about feminism and

(1:07:12) a Broadway it's harder to read and think about it but I guess if we have specific topics in mind like if you want to talk

(1:07:18) about women's happiness and feminism and then the basis of Human Rights we can always reconvene and I can like read more about

(1:07:25) it and then come to a more concrete opinion on these things I guess right now that sounds fair yeah I'm fine with

(1:07:32) that Alex you can always bring on guests if you want to from you know kill 40 minutes with q a or something yeah sure

(1:07:38) I guess the second thing I would bring up which I think you guys might uh you might be you might be better so discussion is gender role so uh I'm

(1:07:46) assuming Andrew believes in very strong traditional gender roles uh I'm assuming farther you do not or am I wrong yeah

(1:07:52) that would be incorrect I think the construction of gender is false and that there's only sex and sex roles and that

(1:07:59) what you would consider to be gender is actually conflated with sex and that

(1:08:04) gender gender in and of itself is nothing more than fashion it's that's all it is it's just a Here and Now

(1:08:09) fashion statement essentially I don't I don't think that gender as you understand it and as I understand it I

(1:08:16) think are completely different things I think that you when you think of gender you're just thinking of behaviors that are feminine uh and when when I think of

(1:08:24) gender I think of sex roles and that the sex roles themselves are what contributes to the behavior not choices

(1:08:30) necessarily okay sure so just rephrasing from gender roles to sex roles you believe that biological males men should

(1:08:38) act like men you don't believe that they should be the caretakers for example or they should be like you believe they should work they shouldn't ask them [ __ ]

(1:08:44) and the woman should stay home with the kids believe that man should act in a way that is virtuous under the confined

(1:08:50) Paradox of deontological Christian ethics and virtue ethics yes so under

(1:08:55) that would would you would say that masculinity uh in and of itself which is part of the nature of a man should most

(1:09:02) definitely be pushed not restricted not confined but with that should come the

(1:09:07) virtues things like Temperance self-control all of those things that allow the bigger stronger sex to control

(1:09:14) themselves from being a bunch of rabid uh you know disgusting animals

(1:09:19) essentially so yeah I think that masculinity is extremely important to society but that men need to have their

(1:09:27) behavior tempered a bit in their judgment 10 a bit uh with virtue do you

(1:09:33) believe there's such a thing as toxic masculinity um

(1:09:39) I it depends on how you mean it if you mean like can some of these red pill idiots go too far with this [ __ ] yeah I

(1:09:46) think that Andrew Tate can go way too far with the [ __ ] that he says I think that I might draw the line at like

(1:09:53) touring another Nation for a 14 year old bride or something like I think that that gets Beyond toxic and into just

(1:09:59) insane to be honest with you but generally I think you would be hard fought or I would be hard pushed to say

(1:10:05) that any kind of real masculine trait is toxic in any shoe way shape or form I think almost every masculine trait's a

(1:10:11) good trait women love us for having them so yeah I agree with you on that so the one that I

(1:10:17) always reference in debates is one aspect of what I think I would consider toxic masculinity is the stigma for men

(1:10:23) to get mental health help right there there's just a little bit of a stigma about it right it's much more socially acceptable for women to go to a

(1:10:28) therapist that is for men so that's what would be something that I would personally consider to be quote-unquote toxic masculinity so that's that's an

(1:10:34) example why is that why is that toxic though why do you think that that's toxic I think that psychologists which

(1:10:42) are psychology in general is overwhelmingly saturated with women and um I don't think that men going to

(1:10:50) women for their issues is necessarily the best idea and I think a woman you can go to male therapists but I think

(1:10:56) that a lot of psychology in and of itself is [ __ ] guesswork I think it's just [ __ ] guesswork I don't

(1:11:01) think it's particularly helpful I don't think that antidepressants in the over prescription of them has been good for

(1:11:06) Society at all and I think it's much smarter that men don't generally go out

(1:11:12) to try to seek uh mental health professionals to help them out with their psychological profile I think the

(1:11:17) reason they don't seek it out nearly as much is because they have what women never seem to be able to have which is

(1:11:22) friends they have actual friends and they hang out with them for hours and hours at a time and have lifelong

(1:11:29) friendships with them and confide in them and things like this and I think that their friends tend to help them out quite a bit so all right we

(1:11:35) fundamentally disagree on that point do you think men have more friends than women I think that they have more real friends

(1:11:41) than women think that women can easily get a lot of Associates but that when you're talking about long-term

(1:11:47) friendships I think men are generally better at being friends with each other than women are and I think that women

(1:11:52) value male friendship as much as men do and value women's friendship about as much as men do which is not very much

(1:11:58) that's just my take though I don't have any I don't have any empirics for that that's just my intuition kind of as

(1:12:05) we're going off topic I'm sure that I could dig that up though if you want me to come back for a debate

(1:12:10) this one is true I just want to explore your thinking father do you disagree with any of what he just said uh well I

(1:12:17) have a question for him he was saying psychology is kind of oversaturated with women I was going to say then do you think psychology is a good tool for

(1:12:24) women or would are you against I think psychology is a bad tool for most people at most times and that it has a history

(1:12:30) of being directed by people who are kid diddlers and Psychopaths themselves and

(1:12:36) that the modern uh transgender phenomenon in many of the modern phenomenons that we see is a social

(1:12:41) contagion in Society come from an overt amount of psychoanalysis from people who

(1:12:47) are trying to basically MK alter your [ __ ] mind that's what I think I think that

(1:12:52) psychology and and the prescription of antidepressants wide and in Mass has been terrifically bad for society it's

(1:12:59) not good for us at all we shouldn't be taking these [ __ ] drugs uh and we never should have been we never should

(1:13:04) have started on this Mass prescription campaign to just dope down the entire public that's a terrible idea

(1:13:13) um I guess I'll speak specifically to like gender are you just against that type of like

(1:13:19) psychological treatment like do you think there could be a healthy form of psychological treatment that addresses the social contagion of what you see as

(1:13:26) gender dysphoria or do you think all of it is what's causing it psychology is it as a field I think that it's definitely

(1:13:33) helped with a mass push towards it including uh we give so much credit to

(1:13:39) these organizations like the APA the American Psychological Association for instance and they have things that are

(1:13:45) on the books that are clearly mental illnesses and due to the lobbying campaigns of various groups they will

(1:13:50) take those things off the book as a mental illness and basically capitulate to the Mob even though quite clearly

(1:13:56) it's a mental illness for a person to be screaming in their head that they have to get out of their body or dismember

(1:14:04) their body to become the opposite sex that's [ __ ] insane but to with the

(1:14:09) move to classify this is other than mental illness is bizarre to me and this

(1:14:15) happens due to lobbying from these groups with tons and tons of money and they're able to leverage organizations

(1:14:21) like the APA I have a video of the pre the former president of the APA talking about conversion therapy where he says

(1:14:27) it was never really tried before the homosexual Lobby came in and began to massively Leverage The APA

(1:14:35) um to drop homosexuality as a mental illness so I don't have a lot of faith a lot of stock in psychological

(1:14:42) institutions it's a soft science it's never been a hard science nobody's ever classified it as a hard science the

(1:14:48) empirical data can almost never be replicated it's what it's the top at the

(1:14:53) replication crisis under the sociology Banner so yeah I have a lot of problems

(1:14:58) with psychology and psychoanalysis and I think that the overprescription of society is terrible for us and I think

(1:15:05) that Alfred Kinsey who started the trans movement in general was a sick kid diddler yes

(1:15:11) I like agree with all the things you said my only critique would be I feel like you're throwing the baby out of the

(1:15:17) bathwater meaning like trans like uh whatever confirmation therapy or the [ __ ] it's called It's a small small part

(1:15:23) of therapy like most people are not going to there for that I think for some people including myself I've been very public about the fact that when I was

(1:15:29) going through a hard time I went to therapy and it was like very very good for me right like it prevented me from becoming an alcoholic prevented me from

(1:15:35) even potentially doing something worse right so I think it can be very good if you go to the right therapist though that's a key precondition let me ask you

(1:15:43) a question did they put you on any antipsychotics no I've never taken an antipsychology

(1:15:48) right so that's the thing when we're talking about this remember that um a response to therapy or things like

(1:15:55) this a lot of this is the issuance around um antipsychotic drugs

(1:16:02) yeah but these are all things that begin to move your State of Mind into a

(1:16:08) suggestive State of Mind where you can you can then through heavy suggestion be

(1:16:13) led to do all sorts of different things it's a mass gumming down of the public from psychologists honestly

(1:16:20) from that entire field yeah but I think you have to separate antidepressants from antipsychotics right antipsychotics

(1:16:26) I fully agree with you cannot be prescribed to anyone who isn't like full-on straight up psychotic right I do

(1:16:32) agree those are over prescribed and you agree with you that antidepressants are also over prescribed just like you know

(1:16:38) um whatever like just like Valium is just like Ritalin is just like all that [ __ ] is over prescribed so I agree with you on that but for certain people ssris

(1:16:45) can actually be very very beneficial like for example again with me when I was going through a hard time I was having panic attacks me getting

(1:16:52) unnecessary stop that from happening and it didn't dumb me down my intelligence level stayed the same it was just

(1:16:57) something that like you know when you have a dream imbalance that could be useful in the right circumstance

(1:17:04) I'm sorry you were you you were breaking up really bad there for some reason I'm having a bad hiccup or did you where did

(1:17:11) you lose me I'm still I'm still losing you here kind of intermittently and I'm I'm not really sure why that's happening

(1:17:17) hang on just give me a second maybe it'll correct itself Laura can you hear me yeah okay so this is it looks like

(1:17:24) maybe a correct corrected itself yeah go go ahead man so the point I was trying to make is I do agree with a lot of the

(1:17:29) stuff you're saying I agree with you that antipsychotics should never be used unless a person with like straight up psychotic I do agree with you those are

(1:17:35) overuse I do agree with you they can lead to disastrous side effects like shootings and uh suicide uh but I think

(1:17:42) that ssris while they are over prescribed not as often they are can be very beneficial to certain people at

(1:17:48) some point in their life like that's going to be true about everything even bad things there you could say that it

(1:17:53) could be true that a person being an alcoholic could be better than the alternative of him not being an alcoholic in some limited cases so I

(1:18:00) would concede that in some limited cases this may be a helpful thing for some people however I'm going to maintain

(1:18:06) that you may have been able to have gotten the same exact help from spiritualism or from your religion which

(1:18:13) is something that's absent in your life that you may have gotten from this over-the-counter drug and I think that

(1:18:19) as we've replaced religion in society would just give them drugs we kind of see this trend don't we of over

(1:18:25) prescription people on antipsychotics antidepressants everywhere it's disproportionately of course affects

(1:18:31) women especially since women generally seem to adopt the religion of their husband and as we become more and more

(1:18:37) religious uh you see that there's less and less women again who have any type of real staunch religious values

(1:18:44) so this is uh I think that this kind of goes part and partial that we have outsourced

(1:18:49) um any form a spiritual fulfillment to people psychoanalyzing us and giving us drugs man I'm not sure that that's the

(1:18:56) best idea I I do agree they should be prescribed more seldomly but I do think in the rights I don't think it's an equivalent

(1:19:02) to like alcohol like alcohol maybe in very extreme cases it could potentially somehow benefit you I don't think ssris

(1:19:09) are like even close to that I think they're three degrees different I think ssris again poor person who has not

(1:19:14) directly look it's not nothing I'm saying as a comparison it's directly analogous it's why it's just it's just a

(1:19:20) comparison of the extreme I'm just looking at the extremes and saying of course there there can be cases where

(1:19:27) drugs like this I'm sure can help people but on average and by and large I think it's been pretty much disastrous and you

(1:19:32) seem to agree with that um I think they're over prescribed I do think they've also saved a bunch of

(1:19:38) people's lives who who would have otherwise committed to yeah but they might have ended up uh greatly destroying other people's lives due to

(1:19:45) the over prescription so it's like you know you have to be you have to be very cautious when you make a statement like

(1:19:50) that right it's like maybe they have but maybe they've also destroyed more lives than they've saved like we don't know well like every brand new phenomenon

(1:19:56) well like everything moderation is the key I mean you someone who's like recreationally drinking whiskey on the

(1:20:01) weekend that's totally fine if someone is drinking 12 glasses of whiskey and then getting behind the car like they're both drinking alcohol but they're not in

(1:20:08) the same category you know moderation is always the key you know for the people if that person for example is taking certain prescriptions you should not be

(1:20:14) drinking if that person is like really young you know he should not be drinking because that will [ __ ] up as like well Alex I don't disagree like I'm not going

(1:20:21) to disagree with any of those normative claims I think they're all true of course that's true like moderation is

(1:20:26) necessary for the success of any human being anywhere in life doing anything and uh any activity you can do too much

(1:20:34) of an it can be bad for you like even drinking water like you do excessively even that can be bad for you and yeah

(1:20:39) this is Cava for God's sake okay I'm just saying right even that could be bad for a person I don't even think we have

(1:20:45) a disagreement here to be honest with you no I would just be arguing we'd be arguing kind of just some Nuance at the

(1:20:51) fringes and who cares really I was just curious about your position on that because that's something that I always believed people about I'm far we so I

(1:20:58) think what we can do next is just bring on people from the chat I think quite a few people have questions for you uh or

(1:21:03) did you want to discuss something else father before we do that um well I do have a question hearing

(1:21:09) that discussion okay so if you View Florida as as a mental illness but then you're also kind of opposed to like

(1:21:15) the institution of psychology of what would be the best way to trade just through like spiritualism or religion because I don't feel like that would

(1:21:20) work in cases of other mental illnesses like why not that's how it always traditionally worked traditionally

(1:21:27) mental illness was treated by spiritual people spiritual fathers it was treated even in localized tribes by shamans

(1:21:34) people like this and by the way before there was mass amounts of psychologists all over the place and and we were

(1:21:41) psychoanalyzing everybody and their brother if we go back uh 90 80 years we

(1:21:47) find that the trends in depression and suicide and things like this are greatly decreased they're they're much less it's

(1:21:54) much much much less okay so as religion was very when when religion when any society is highly

(1:22:01) religious you see those issues greatly decrease even psychologists will say that that's true that that people who

(1:22:07) live spiritual lives seem to have much less cases of uh or less cases of mental

(1:22:12) illness depression things like this the numbers bear that out the more religious they are generally the lower that trend

(1:22:19) is there's a lot of people who pay lip service and say they're religious who aren't so when you look at the stats you

(1:22:24) have to really dive into them but the more on the side of the religious that you are seemingly the less likely you

(1:22:30) are to have those types of issues and historically that's been the trend as well I guess I was asking whether that

(1:22:36) extends to other types of mental illnesses like schizophrenia or do you think that's more particular to depression anxiety yeah the the Catholic

(1:22:43) Church especially uh but Protestant churches traditionally had hospice cares

(1:22:48) that they would privately fund for people who had conditions like that which are completely irreversible and

(1:22:54) psychologists can do very little about them now they can do very little about those conditions now except create care

(1:23:00) facilities to put people in that's it okay so you don't believe medic like

(1:23:06) same way you're saying that medication isn't typically the best solution for depression so you feel

(1:23:11) similarly for those other mental illnesses as well it probably just more harm than help generally for things like schizophrenia

(1:23:18) well I mean yeah we we haven't been able to cure any of these we haven't been able to cure dementia or schizophrenia

(1:23:23) or the decline in cognitive ability we just create facilities to put these people in I do think that it's a good

(1:23:29) idea maybe to continue with drug development to try to treat some of these things but an overprescription of

(1:23:34) them is terrible just like an over prescription of antibiotics would be terrible that's how you end up with antibiotic resistant diseases right

(1:23:42) trying to govern the mind with drugs is a great New Frontier and great new

(1:23:48) experiment and it's not going very well so far we don't really know what the ramifications of it all will be yet

(1:23:55) and I'm very cautious about that so just saying okay that's fair so the way you see a

(1:24:02) transgenderism is a social contagion you fill out wafer also uh depression anxiety schizophrenia no I didn't say

(1:24:08) that those were social contagions no I'm asking no those aren't social contagions those are biological

(1:24:14) conditions dementia is a biological condition schizophrenia is a biological condition

(1:24:20) these aren't just mental conditions at this point these are actual physical conditions they're physical ailments

(1:24:26) so these these transcend just the mental these aren't just there's people there's people who have sudden onsets of

(1:24:32) dementia who didn't before have it who were completely cognitively perfect and

(1:24:37) had no depression of any kind no mental illness of any kind these are physical conditions you're alluding to those aren't social contagions a social

(1:24:44) contagion would be something that's all in the mind but because it's been pushed out in the general public through mass

(1:24:51) media indoctrination and things like this people begin to believe that that

(1:24:56) thing is true or that they should participate into it just like with propaganda that would be a social

(1:25:02) contagion that's a whole different categorys
