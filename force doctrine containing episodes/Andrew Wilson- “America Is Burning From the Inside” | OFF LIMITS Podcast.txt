Title: Andrew Wilson: “America Is Burning From the Inside” | OFF LIMITS Podcast

(0:00) you're talking about the dangers of revisionism uh when it comes to to certain social categories based around

(0:05) the fact that there could be political agendas behind it or things like this i agree but I'm also reminded of a

(0:11) Napoleon Bonapart quote that history is an agreed upon set of lies and so when

(0:16) you talk about consensus right this is what Napoleon Bonapart was was saying here he was saying well there's a lot of

(0:22) consensus when it comes to history they agree on a whole lot of things that just aren't true right

(0:27) [Music]

(0:33) you know the world has changed since the last time we spoke and some would say for the better some would say for the

(0:38) worse some would say there's a it's a mixed bag which is usually what I say um

(0:44) what are your thoughts man what are your I wanted to kind of talk about We can talk about whatever you want to talk about i'd love to talk about what's on

(0:50) your mind what you're worried about and what you're optimistic about but um one of the things I've been kind of talking

(0:56) about a lot is this this new sort of phenomenon of the power of podcasts and

(1:02) the power of there are a lot of people out there that love to get on a podcast and say you're being lied to i've done

(1:09) the research and everybody else is wrong and I'm right and that can be about

(1:14) vaccines that can be about uh Gaza that can be about Ukraine that can be about anything but I'm I'm interested in your

(1:22) perspective on that so um I have a good buddy of mine he's a

(1:27) he's a a podcaster his name is Made by Jim Bob he's uh he's a pretty well-known

(1:33) uh satirical artist [ __ ] hilarious guy and uh he calls it he calls it the

(1:38) files right he says "These guys always have a file right they're going to pull out the file and they're going to

(1:45) elucidate for you the truth the hidden truth they're going to reveal it in all

(1:51) of its entirety yes and also pay me money right but I mean that's the like that's the whole the whole game right

(1:58) and the thing is is that there's so much truth that just isn't so right so much

(2:04) truth just isn't so but here's what's happened in the market nobody trusts the mainstream media and it's dying and it's

(2:10) not like remember uh 10 years ago people were like "The mainstream media is dying blah blah." I mean now it's really

(2:16) [ __ ] dying it's not like it was when we were talking about it before and the ratings are down and this I mean they're

(2:22) laying off everybody they're laying off everybody the Megan Kelly's of the world they're podcasting they're not going on

(2:28) major news networks anymore pierce Morgan is drafting people out of the podcast world to debate geopolitical

(2:35) issues the world has changed okay it has completely changed because of that as a hole in the market the old news

(2:42) paradigms they knew how to regulate this right they've been running broadcast news for a hundred years they were running it on the radio and then they

(2:49) moved over to I think it was CNN who started the first 24 hours news network um long before Fox News ever came along

(2:57) and uh they we we know how to regulate the news right there was like some kind of checks and balances which was in

(3:04) there and you could get hit with liel and get sued and all sorts of different things right this is the wild [ __ ]

(3:09) west okay this is the wild west nobody knows what the regulations are youtube can't even tell you when you're

(3:15) violating the toos they'll just remove your channel maybe if you're lucky uh if you're lucky they'll just demonetize it

(3:21) right uh these these tech companies don't seem to uh give you any particular

(3:26) rules so nobody even knows what rules they're all playing by right and so uh that's what you have you have and it

(3:32) feels a lot like the Wild West now with this big massive hole right so Elon Musk

(3:38) tries to address this and he's like "Look there's going to be a lot of fake news if you're going to have a an open market

(3:45) of ideas right and you're not paying for the moderation anymore there's going to be a lot of fake news and you're going

(3:51) to have to actually be able to put your thinking cap on again so that you can sift through what's nonsense and what

(3:57) isn't in some ways I think it's actually good for society that you have to now think instead of just having it spoonfed

(4:04) to you and then you point it to the source and say "See the source is legitimate so it's good." Right now that

(4:09) those days are over so um you know there's there's goods and bads with it but that's what's going on man it's the

(4:15) Wild West and in in the age of influence and this is what it is in the information war the there's two forms of

(4:23) combat the first form of combat is a reputation of lies right and the second form of combat is debate that's the two

(4:30) forms that you have and it's like right now uh both of those are in full effect and the progressive left is losing

(4:37) ground in a big way because of it so well the progressive left doesn't have

(4:43) their mistake was not having anything to anchor into there was no real bedrock and I'll give you an example if your

(4:49) feelings were reality and if your feelings were sacrosanked then um then I

(4:54) had to that's what you you were leaving me to anchor into so if a man is a man

(5:00) because that I feel like a man or a woman's a woman because I feel like a woman and I can't really define it i

(5:06) don't know what to anchor into so you you really can't you can't mount a

(5:11) credible defense uh when that is your philosophy it's just going to crumble because you can't

(5:17) apply it at the level of detail we're not orientated around not even not only just a a truth but even a reality at

(5:24) this point and so the rest of us are going to work and trying to make a living and going I all right whatever your pronouns if you and what happens

(5:31) immediately is oh you have pronouns on your resume cool i'm not hiring you and

(5:37) the reason I'm not going to hire you is I'm I'm just don't want to deal with somebody who Yeah i just don't I got I

(5:43) gotta shoot a commercial or I've got to shoot a movie or I've got to run a restaurant i I I just can't stop for

(5:50) your feelings cuz your feelings don't matter results matter and that's what's quickly happened I think and I I think

(5:56) it's not surprising that at least young men are swaying at least more practical and traditional all right let's be

(6:02) honest i don't know if you're a human being living in this world but you ever uh experience I don't know a 3pm crash a

(6:08) mid-m morning crash your energy just isn't there your brain fog you're having trouble finishing sentences you're

(6:14) staring in the fridge you don't know why just that lack of energy well guess what

(6:20) there's something called Vinnie out there so your circulatory system is literally a highway system and right now

(6:25) most of us are stuck in traffic but get this if you don't feel the difference in physical energy and mental sharpness

(7:03) middle of this i'm loving it let me know what you think let's get back to the podcast do you do the old man groan i

(7:09) have So I have this old man groan it goes like that like when when I hear nonsensical [ __ ] like you know

(7:16) pronouns in a resume it's something like oh you know like it just well I'm beyond that it just like it's it's it's this

(7:23) completely defeated old man grown of like this [ __ ] again again aren't we

(7:28) past this now are we done with this [ __ ] yeah i don't concern myself with that anymore because I don't even think that's the threat my my issue is that

(7:36) what's way more difficult in life is not drawing comparisons but it's understanding the meaningful difference

(7:42) between things um and having a consistent and we've talked about this battle tested stress- tested philosophy

(7:49) that can withstand an attack from any front at any angle uh that is much more

(7:54) difficult so it so so I worry now really about the fact that you have powerful

(8:02) platforms that can showcase different people who get rewarded for amplifying a

(8:09) monologue that says you're being lied to i'm right i went to medical school i

(8:16) learned nothing seed oils are killing you uh vaccines are dangerous uh we didn't go to the moon and here's why etc

(8:23) etc and my my worry is that I kind of say to myself look look you can say

(8:30) we're being lied to and you can say and it's true it's true that you can point to when the scientific community and the

(8:36) experts let us down it's true that trusting the science unless you're talking about trans stuff trusting the

(8:43) science unless you're talking about maybe COVID uh uh a bunch of faceless bureaucrats uh saying that the lab leak

(8:49) is racist okay I get it of course the legacy media did not behave well both

(8:55) can be true we've got to learn as Americans that both can be true but that at the end of the day there is something

(9:02) called acumen there's something called expertise if you want to get your spine

(9:08) uh uh operated on you want somebody who's been through the what's called the

(9:13) traditional medical schools and has been steeped in the scientific method you

(9:20) don't want a guy who says "Hey I've done all this research on spinal surgery i'm the guy who knows how to do it differently unless he's been steeped in

(9:27) all of that as well." So that's kind of what I worry about well I think Well I

(9:33) mean I think you bring up a valid point but then maybe I can give a little push back here so the idea of like something which has

(9:40) an an application something that's applied in this case medicine where you're going to do open heart surgery or

(9:45) something like this right the reason that you trust those people is because they interned under other people who did

(9:51) open heart surgery for years and years and years and they have tons and tons and tons of hands-on practice with that

(9:57) right with that but let's say that there was another country somewhere I don't know where um where the person was not

(10:04) they didn't do medicine in a traditional sense like we do they don't do alopathic medicine they do some other type of

(10:10) traditional medicine but they also do open heart surgery but their success rate was way way way higher than the

(10:16) alopathic success rate um wouldn't she still go to them to get your heart worked on i would I would I'd be

(10:22) responsible to the evidence and that makes Yeah that makes And that makes total sense right the success so I'm

(10:28) just saying that credentialism itself is something which is pretty easy to reject because there's so many educated [ __ ]

(10:34) idiots running around don't know what the hell they're talking about and they just regurgitate right so when you're talking about something which has an

(10:39) application like that like medicine remember that one of the leading causes of death in the United States is medical

(10:45) malpractice one of the leading causes right misdiagnosis botched surgeries you

(10:51) know the list goes on and on and on so you're literally putting your hands in experts who kill an awful lot of people

(10:56) there's not a doctor I've ever met who hasn't killed somebody by accident and they're pretty open about it how could

(11:02) they avoid it it's like it's basically impossible but I don't want to be that guy i don't want to be the guy they you

(11:09) know that they kill in order to see how many times have you done this operation yeah yeah yeah exactly so so the thing

(11:15) is is like I think I think an application you may have a point but what if we're just talking about knowledge like when somebody's just like

(11:22) a an expert in a field based solely and completely on just the idea of knowledge

(11:29) with no application like how do you apply history how do you apply you know

(11:34) like how do you apply those things other than through a prism of opinion what makes the expert then that's the

(11:41) question well I would say the I would say the answer to that right now would be the consensus so So as a I studied

(11:49) Nazi Germany in in college i was a history major i don't know a lot i mean you know you could you could quiz me and

(11:54) a historian would make a mockery of me um but but but I do have some core

(12:00) tenants one of the things you you get from studying history for four years and if your area of focus would be say Nazi

(12:06) Germany is that there are certain agreed upon facts from which we contribut there

(12:12) there's a mothership of of ideas and and let's call them truths uh based on what

(12:18) actually happened so we know that Trebinka and Awitz were death camps we know that a lot of Jews were killed you

(12:25) want to you want to parse 6 million or 5 million whatever you want to do but for the most part we know it was an an unacceptable amount and genocide was

(12:33) something that was coined probably for the first time we know the Nuremberg trials happened we know the Nazis kept

(12:39) very careful records and when you get this scient this historical consensus

(12:44) based on historians from France and from the Soviet Union and from Germany and from the United States etc they tend to

(12:52) agree on the core facts and then from there there's

(12:57) some dispute right and then when you get some um rogue historian who comes along

(13:04) and says you know actually all these guys are wrong and this is what really

(13:10) happened well that's quite the challenge sometimes those people you know end up

(13:16) changing everything right they have a scientific discovery and they say like Freud or I'm sorry or or um um Darwin

(13:23) says "Hey guys it's really not about Aristotle in the Bible there's something called natural selection." And we go

(13:28) "What the fuck?" And here's here's the evidence right but for the most part we kind of know to ignore that rogue

(13:35) historian when they're coming out with an outlandish thing based on some their own research that seems to buck against

(13:42) this massive body of evidence right so maybe that's the answer to how we can know who

(13:51) to listen to when it comes to history after the dust is settled versus who not to does that make sense napoleon I I get

(13:57) what you're saying i understand you're talking about the dangers of revisionism uh when it comes to to certain social

(14:03) categories based around the fact that there could be political agendas behind it or things like this or it can it can

(14:09) definitely be something which can be adopted for a portion of political agenda i agree but I'm also reminded of

(14:14) a Napoleon Bonapart quote that history is an agreed upon set of lies and so

(14:19) when you talk about consensus right this is what Napoleon Bonapart was was saying here he was saying well there's a lot of

(14:25) consensus when it comes to history they agree on a whole lot of things that just aren't true right um let me give you a

(14:31) counter example right i think that your example here when it comes to the Holocaust is perfectly acceptable but

(14:36) perhaps a counter example of where uh historians got it real wrong for a long time and agreed uh basically 100% with

(14:45) each other even though they knew they were wrong and that's the pyramids of Giza that these were tombs that were

(14:50) designed for mummies even though no tombs are ever found in any of these places they were obviously some type of

(14:56) machine that's built or they have some other purpose that we don't know about but clearly clearly they weren't tombs

(15:04) and the outside historians were the ones the revisionists saying "No this this

(15:09) can't be the case this is absurd we know where all the mummies are buried they're in the uh you know they're 100 miles

(15:15) that way you know what I mean in the tombs of kings that's a great example." And they were totally right they were

(15:20) totally right a great example and it's like well you know so we got to you got to be kind of cautious here when you you

(15:27) know when you when you categorize this because now I does one of those have more impact than the other ultimately

(15:33) yeah i get I suppose especially in modernity right but it's still a massive

(15:38) discovery that we're that we're talking about and whole generations were taught something which was obviously false and

(15:46) that they knew was obviously false you know and so so like um and and that

(15:52) comes into the play of like we're being lied to it's like well yeah we kind of are and there's a lot of agendas behind

(15:58) lying to us and so um I think I've always been of the mindset that sunlight

(16:04) is the best disinfectant so it's like okay if you have a bunch of Holocaust revisionists then debate them you know

(16:10) then put the sunlight on it and let's see you know who But the problem is they go well you can't do that because then

(16:17) you're propagating like genocidal lunatic ideas right and so well or

(16:22) sometimes like someone like David Irving who's been debunked you know to a pretty large

(16:28) degree so that no historian really wants to get up there and start kind of dealing with a guy who has these sort of

(16:34) fringe ideas that you know that that are not really being made in good faith maybe so that that would be one of the

(16:41) issues that that that I see you know misinformation having said that though where Daryl Cooper who I'm actually a

(16:47) fan of cuz I listen to his to a lot of his podcasts um and he's not a he's not a Nazi apologist by any means but but

(16:54) having said that there is there is with this free flow of ideas there is a lot

(17:00) of push back and now we're having this conversation Dave Smith and I don't know if you watched the Dave Smith Douglas

(17:06) Murray um debate i know Dave and I love Dave i've had many conversations with Dave and and uh what I thought was

(17:13) interesting about that was Douglas Murray is a guy I admire and Douglas Murray is a guy I'm going to go to when I want to know what's really going on on

(17:19) the ground in Gaza or whatever however it didn't it didn't disqualify the fact

(17:25) that Dave Smith was saying "Hey dude i've not been there but I can see pictures of a leveled northern Gaza and

(17:32) I know that an unacceptable number of children have been orphaned and killed i

(17:38) don't I you may be right in in what you're saying in terms of how bad Hamas

(17:45) is or how they fight i'm still dealing with children trapped under rubble and I

(17:50) just don't want to live in a world like that and I'm outraged by it and again both can be true right where you kind of

(17:56) go I get where he's coming from he's coming from a good place right and in

(18:02) that sense I thought Dave was extremely good faith in that debate i thought that um I thought that Murray was was not

(18:09) nearly as good faith as uh as Smith was and the thing is is like I you know I've debated with Dave you know what I mean

(18:16) and I will always enjoy crushing Dave Smith's ideas his crazy libertarian

(18:22) ideas under the boot heel of the Christian nationalist prism but the thing is is like I still I still like

(18:30) this guy i still like this guy and I still think he's a great I still think he's a great debater i talk to him in

(18:35) DMs all the time you know and I think that he's starting to really come into his own but where Dave Smith went right

(18:42) and where Murray went wrong is Dave Smith realized after many many debates

(18:47) debates are about structured arguments for a worldview right and it doesn't matter what you're debating right if

(18:54) you're if you're debating about something that has empirical backing empirical backing doesn't give us it

(18:59) doesn't tell us what we should do it only gives us descriptors right that's it just descriptors that's right dave Smith said "I see your descriptor what

(19:07) is your argument?" And Murray didn't have one and that was that was that he

(19:12) said "What they're not making arguments i want arguments that I can really contend with." And Murray was making

(19:18) them yeah douglas Murray's argument was for kinetic force actually because that was the only thing bringing the the the

(19:23) hostages home and the kinetic force that Israel was applying to Gaza was all on

(19:29) Hamas's doorstep i can accept that argument to an extent wait what about when he said though that the there

(19:36) should be some kind of like prerequisite requirement for you to go to these countries before you speak out about any

(19:42) of the things which are happening in them that's a descriptive claim right it is a description backed by what what is

(19:48) he backing that by like there's so much information that I I've uh learned about

(19:54) all sorts of states I've never gone to right all sorts of places I haven't gone to where I still understand what the

(20:00) laws are and what what's going on on the ground i you know what I think that was i think that was Douglas Murray who's

(20:05) paid a price being a war correspondent in what he's seen i'm talking about the emotional trauma of what he's seen and I

(20:12) and I think then he has some guy who's never done that and he's been "Hey dude i've been sleeping on the floor seeing

(20:17) children die and you you can understand where a guy goes listen you pleb." I I I've been in the trenches you know and

(20:24) you're talking about it and I think that got the best of him you know i I think that he was also talking about if you're

(20:30) going to talk about checkpoints and if you're going to talk about trade routes and you're going to talk about uh it being an open air prison it would be

(20:37) better to be there to see what daily life is like and talk to the gazins and see actually where it's not that it

(20:45) might give you a different perspective so we don't so we don't fall into the trap but doesn't that also infer bias

(20:50) like because you have seen this from a single perspective especially and have dealt with this kind of trauma that you

(20:57) have some bias in this uh entire thing when you are reporting about it in this

(21:02) type of thing right it's like this this happens often if you have American correspondents during an American war it

(21:09) dug in and entrenched with the troops they're almost always going to have the pro- US perspective on this those are

(21:15) the people that they're friends with those are the people who are dying around you'd still want to get your information from the embedded journalist

(21:22) probably to know what's really happening right because if they're responsible journalists they're also seeing the

(21:28) battlefield and and and in touch with the battlefield on a tactile tactile way

(21:34) that you wouldn't be otherwise right so we would we we just naturally as human beings go it's a different thing to be

(21:41) there you're going to get a different perspective it's a little bit like I listen I agree with that you're saying

(21:46) that everything in the military and from the government to military level including for war correspondents is

(21:53) designed specifically to push out a message a narrative and the narrative is always going to be friendly to the side

(21:59) you're embedded with it's all that's always going to be the case where the political pressure is uh for not not

(22:05) just war correspondents but for anybody who's on the ground it's going to be a positive message towards that side

(22:10) nobody wants to embed journalists with their troops so that they go back and report badly on their nation right so so

(22:16) they're always going to put them in this in in the situations they they they

(22:22) possibly can for the best possible publicity and press towards their side so there could be an implication there

(22:27) of bias as well it's not it's not nearly so one-dimensional you know it's not onedimensional i would say the the there

(22:33) are two liabilities i think podcasts on the whole especially like Joe Rogan's podcast and stuff has

(22:39) been a good thing for all of us because we have been exposed to some of the best that's been thought and said we've been

(22:46) exposed to just great ideas people who write books nobody has time to write a book but you get a sense of what the book is about in three hours etc etc i

(22:53) think where the liability is is two things one as podcasters we don't have the attention span to hold on to

(23:00) something to its completion in terms of like don't rely on podcast only as your source of information but the second

(23:06) thing is this if a if it's a guy like Joe Rogan it's a guy like myself it's a guy like you know um whoever it might be

(23:14) uh if you have somebody on there who says something like and I'm and I'm using this as an example because I don't

(23:20) think it's fair to Daryl Cooper but if he said uh actually you know the Nazis were were provoked into uh into this war

(23:29) the Russians were given no choice but to invade Ukraine uh etc etc you need

(23:36) somebody who is very familiar with that argument and where it came from to stop

(23:42) it in its tracks or at least to push back before we get any further that is the only liability I see in terms of

(23:49) like sometimes if you don't know that David Irving is that historian if you

(23:54) don't know enough about math and Terrence Howard's talk saying 1* 1 is two you're you're not going to

(24:00) understand why that's a destructive idea and why it's a ridiculous idea if you don't know that the Sinai Bible the

(24:06) synoptic gospels are a forgery um then you're going to go "Hey hey you know

(24:12) there there's a lot of evidence that Christ wasn't crucified." But then you get a guy like right you get a guy like Wes Hala goes "Uh excuse me you dude who

(24:20) says he's traveled everywhere you're a fraud and you're talking about a known fraud." You didn't even know that once I

(24:26) heard that I went "Oh this guy's a complete idiot." And that's good to have right that's expertise uh people who are

(24:32) real mathematicians should be uh should be debating against a guy like Terren

(24:37) Howard all due respect great let me ask you this because you bring up you bring up this good point uh with with Weshoff

(24:44) who did this uh incredible debate where by the way very composed very kind the

(24:50) entire debate did not he never blinked he never even blinked

(24:57) no he was a a blank slate and he all he simply did was ask a few very very like

(25:04) um nonchalant style questions and led this guy right into the abyss right

(25:11) where his all of his skin melted off his bones were disintegrated there was

(25:17) nothing left it was what's that guy's name it was I don't remember but it was an accidental it was an accidental in

(25:24) many ways master class on how you can really deliver a coupigra in a debate if

(25:30) you're armed with knowledge the other person which is what you're alluding to like he was the right guy at the right

(25:37) place at the right time to contest this but here's the thing doesn't this in some ways give you a good

(25:42) counternarrative for this which is if these people proliferate the idea and build it up and build it up all it takes

(25:49) is one expert to come in and just completely destroy it down to its roots

(25:55) and isn't Isn't that what sticks with people 100% you know like so so in some ways isn't it its own checks and balance

(26:03) you know what I mean like uh like sure you run the risk that you could get some misinformation or people out there who

(26:08) are delivering on a a bad message i'm sure there's all sorts of people who disagree with you on the provocation of

(26:14) Germans whether or not we were responsible for Pearl Harbor ourselves due to the various policies the US was

(26:19) implementing against Imperial Japan there's a million different thoughts that are going around here right yes yes

(26:24) but all it really takes is one guy if the wrong narrative gets prolifer proliferated to just destroy it so

(26:32) deeply into its roots that there is no recovery and you know to piggyback on

(26:37) that I thought that Dave Smith made the expert look uh a little callous because

(26:43) in fact in fact as much as I admired Douglas Murray I didn't hear any

(26:49) solution other than more kinetic force more destruction more death and that was

(26:57) that that was a tough pill to swallow now maybe he's being real politic about

(27:02) this and maybe maybe that's the reality on the ground but I hate living in a world like that at least Dave Smith said

(27:08) "Does it not does it not bother you is it not worth talking about that children

(27:14) are are trapped under rubble and screaming and nobody's coming?" That's a real question as human beings we should

(27:21) be asking that question maybe it's a Christian not only do I agree but you know I have one of the things that I

(27:27) have a lot of uh respect for Dave uh on he reminds me a lot of me in this way right the not one step back so Dave he

(27:35) goes into the lion's den outgunned all the time and he frankly doesn't give a

(27:40) [ __ ] in fact more and more he's seeming to be right at home in that environment right because he because I think Yeah

(27:46) he's coming in there with with at least how he believes there's a right and a wrong mhm right he's trying to give he's

(27:52) trying to give an association here and just say look if nobody else is going to speak on this and from this view I will

(27:59) and I'm going to do the best job you know now maybe I'm just a comics somewhere right now I argued uh I would

(28:05) say fairly successfully on X on behalf of comics after that debate and said look when you if you want to really look

(28:11) at social change right I would argue that comedians deliver social change

(28:16) better than any think tank could ever dream of and any social progressive NGO could ever think of as much as they

(28:23) love social engineering the truth is is that a wellplaced joke can bring society to its knees for a week and I've seen it

(28:29) i've seen it a hundred times where the entire discourse of the nation changes over one guy's joke yeah right and why

(28:38) because it's delivering so much truth otherwise it wouldn't make you laugh right it couldn't make you laugh if it

(28:43) wasn't true so true and so there you know the the half of the nation is dying of laughter and the other half is

(28:49) cleaning their rifles thinking how to get them to shut their mouths right and this this is uh I would argue um one of

(28:58) the key points for social change is through satire men respond really well

(29:03) to satire and it's a easy way to break down barriers between men self-deprecating jokes assist with that

(29:09) as well but also kind of brutal cutting jokes if you want to look at um John

(29:14) Stewart of the Daily Show he was a master of changing political discourse through through cutting rhetoric of the

(29:21) rightwing you know what I mean now this new guy this new guy Oliver he sucks at it right but but Steuart was good yeah

(29:28) yeah john Oliver he annoys me but but uh that's I I love doing that with my new

(29:34) special I kind of I what I what dawned me about the trans movement was you one

(29:39) of the things that's was fun to hold on to was that if you wanted to be a minority if for minorities like black

(29:45) brown and indigenous people to be minorities they had to go through hundreds of years of colonization and and uh and slavery but you now could be

(29:53) white as the driven snow you could be a you could be a white biological male and

(29:58) be a more threatened and larger minority than a black man ask Dave Chappelle and

(30:04) you didn't have to go through slavery or anything else you could be a white person could be a bigger minority than a

(30:10) brown person a indigenous person or a black person because they felt like one that's the the root of it you you

(30:17) literally could just feel like a man or a woman regardless of what your biology

(30:23) was and now we had to treat you not only as the most vulnerable you might because

(30:28) you could take your your own life you just turn yourself into a minority that's it that's what you can do you

(30:34) just turn your you just magic wand yourself what do I mean think about this and you go why you have a beard and a dick no but I feel like Oh well

(30:41) everybody now we've got a you know don't name him apparently his name is is is Andrina and not Andrew anymore holy [ __ ]

(30:48) well it's really it's really funny you make a good point here right but sometimes it's in what's not said so I

(30:53) when I was growing up I always heard it said this way by the left women and minorities whenever they were making a a

(30:59) political reference to you know somebody's going to get [ __ ] over here it was always women this is going to

(31:05) disproportionately affect who women and minorities well who the [ __ ] left okay

(31:11) well well who's left right if it's women and who's left there's only one group that's left that's right that's exactly

(31:18) right sometimes it's like what's not said sometimes it's like what not what's not said kill all the white men yeah

(31:24) exactly what's not said is what you're actually saying you know what I mean it's like there's only one group left

(31:29) here guys you know so you might as well just say the quiet part out right right

(31:35) right just just talk about passive aggressive man yeah so bad so so so do

(31:40) you worry about misinformation and and and do you worry that misinformation keeps the average American from the

(31:46) truth or is there no way i don't worry as much about it um without institutional support and so that's the

(31:54) that's another key part right is like the the Fouchy misinformation that was going around for the jabby stabbies

(32:01) during C19 and all of this madness where tech censorship was at an all-time high i would argue at the the most all-time

(32:08) high I've ever seen it in my life people were getting banned for saying the word vaccine that's it then banned your whole

(32:14) channel's gone yep that had real institutional authority behind the

(32:20) misinformation uh to the point of of legislation talking they were talking and the left

(32:26) wants you to conveniently forget this but they were talking about co passports and not for you to travel to other

(32:31) countries but for you to go to [ __ ] work okay for you to go to work they wanted you to have your papers you know

(32:38) and you were going to get checkpoint stops you know on the way on the way to your job and this type of thing and it's like now I could see some sense in this

(32:45) If you had a pandemic where it's like this is a 50% mortality rate you know what I mean 25% yeah if you

(32:52) patriotically need to stay at home because otherwise you could kill your whole family here in a big way that was

(32:57) not the case okay that was just simply not for a while we were told for a while well it all fell apart the second they

(33:04) were like well yeah you know Black Lives Matter can burn everything down and be in close proximity because social justice is more important than grandma

(33:10) and it's like get the [ __ ] out of here get the [ __ ] out that collapsed the entire narrative for everybody that was

(33:16) it it was over the left lost right then and there the second the newspaper articles came out and said "Social

(33:22) distancing for thee but not for me because this whole social justice thing

(33:27) that takes priority over the fact that grandma's dying and you can't go see her you disgusting non-patriotic piece of

(33:34) human garbage." Yeah so but but ultimately to kind of to kind of back it up misinformation right now from

(33:40) podcasters has no institutional power except on the left what we found and

(33:46) discovered and recently we've also discovered that there is a a little bit of corporate sponsorship from uh

(33:52) right-wing NOS's on right-wing commentators remember the whole uh you know soft drinks welfare soft drinks

(33:58) debacle right where a bunch of right-wing influencers came out and said "Well I'll be damned if I'm not going to

(34:04) allow people to use their food stamps on Coca-Cola products." And it turns out they were all getting the same marching orders right that's no bueno but real

(34:12) government top down institutional authority left-wing podcasts have been getting paid from all sorts of left-wing

(34:17) think tanks who get government kickbacks and to push the Biden agenda and everything else that's right that's been going on for a long time i didn't know

(34:24) that until very recently by the way yep and tech companies artificially also prop up many of the left-wing messengers

(34:30) now we knew about this years ago the the Crucible we we'd be in other uh creators

(34:36) discords watching them go over their like little think tank discourse you know what I mean here's how you refute

(34:42) this and here's how you refute that and here's what we're going to do with it and I'm like where are you getting this [ __ ] where's this stuff coming from well

(34:48) and Legacy Media had the same script they they'd all be saying the exact same thing so it was coming down the wire

(34:54) from I don't know the AP or whoever it was that was amazing they'd literally be reading the they'd be saying the same

(35:01) thing in unison so it's Yeah and it would be disseminated just like that and it's like you know from the from the

(35:07) bottom up we found out that Briana Woo with um with a with a progressive think

(35:12) tank went to Twitch politics and bought up every single tw left-wing Twitch

(35:18) political streamer they could possibly find including ones that had 50 live viewers and put them on the payroll and

(35:24) we're paying them a,0002,000 $5,000 a month in order to shill on behalf of

(35:29) this organization called Progressive Victory right so an agent provocator by the way completely against Twitch's toos

(35:36) so what did they do they said "Ah they're just consultants right they don't work for for us they're they're

(35:42) you know they're consultants." So complied with the tool story breaks on this right and they just kind of shrug

(35:48) it off it's like well you know no big deal and it's like look it's a big deal so there is I think misinformation with

(35:55) institutional authority that can be very dangerous but misinformation from a guy in his basement right well

(36:02) here example of the biggest biggest misinformation

(36:08) podcast or radio show I've ever heard it was called Coast to Coast AM by ArtBell

(36:13) okay whole thing was misinformation and he the ArtBell was smart he knew it wonderful entertainment right everybody

(36:20) was enjoying themselves listening to that show you would be hearing about the gray aliens as you were driving down I5

(36:26) at 1:00 in the morning with Art Bell's silky smooth voice telling you how it is

(36:32) that the gray nymph are going to come back in time in order to assassinate your grandparents right wonderful

(36:38) misinformation totally entertaining right uh but but you have to have context you have to have context right

(36:45) and this is the thing is like right now we don't have context but I think that'll come in time yeah I think that

(36:52) you make a great point i never thought of that that's that's very true the amount of misinformation that was coming

(36:57) out of the left from Russian collusion to for that matter trans ideology to

(37:02) COVID misinformation um all of that and and they won't recover from that the legacy media will

(37:08) not recover they just won't and they shouldn't frankly they shouldn't um so

(37:13) they did the too big to fail too thing but by the way they really tried it's also funny that all of that all of that

(37:19) effort to buy up all those Twitch streamers and things like that didn't work it just didn't work did it

(37:26) oprah Beyonce none of them none of them they they launched it they threw everything i had the benefit my friend

(37:33) oh it was it was the most wonderful thing i wish you could have been having a drink with me right here in my

(37:39) basement studio you would have had the time of your life as I tuned in election night I called the election early the

(37:45) second I saw the blue wall topple I was like "This is over." And we got to put on a live stream of a very famous

(37:51) streamer named Destiny who had all of his entire coalition of progressive victory bought and paid for shill

(37:57) [ __ ] scumbags all in the same room right and all of them in a shocked state

(38:05) of absolute disbelief crying and hugging and I just couldn't take it to the

(38:12) laughter of Andrew Wilson who just I could not contain it it must have been an hour straight of just pure laugh and

(38:20) the chat that nicotine that nicotine laugh and the chat was laughing and everyone was laughing and we just have

(38:27) not stopped laughing but the thing is is you're right it didn't work it didn't work ultimately right but that was with

(38:34) some institutional power behind the uh the messaging and it still didn't work

(38:39) so do like regular podcasters who have folders full of [ __ ] we're going to go over the grassy null today boys and

(38:45) here's all my evidence do like is that really going to be earthshattering or earth changing for misinformation i

(38:51) don't think so i don't think so either i think we're all right i And by the way for the record I think Destiny is at

(38:56) least Destiny takes on people at least he debates at least he's in the mix you know we got one live in uh in in uh you

(39:02) know two weeks live at university oh I can't wait yeah i mean I've been debating with the Kummer Gremlin for

(39:09) [ __ ] years like that's it's always going to be the case um there's like a I don't know who's Batman and who's Joker

(39:16) in the dynamic but we've been we've been fighting for years it's always been above board you know what I mean we take

(39:22) a couple of pop shots at each other but it's always been pretty much above board he's the only He's He's the only

(39:27) worthwhile [ __ ] on the left to debate anymore he's the only one who's even worth debating i wish I wish I'd been

(39:33) there when Wes Watson was threatening you cuz uh I would have uh I would have had to um stepped up in your place and

(39:42) uh I would have been like "That's my friend he's smarter than you but if you

(39:47) want to smack him you can try to smack me and we can see what happens it's not going to it's going to be a bad day for

(39:52) you." Well he's in you know he's back in prison he's back in prison i know i

(39:57) didn't like that that really made me mad because you're my buddy and I was like "All right this is this is that's not Andrew Wilson's thing he's But he did

(40:04) you know what though he did me the biggest service ever in in a way right?"

(40:09) Because there was never a need There was never a need for me to engage with any of the physical stupidity right all I

(40:16) needed to do was it was so crazy inappropriate it was so it was so the

(40:21) distinction here's the distinction in messaging right what I'm I'm not trying to give you materialism i'm not trying

(40:27) to give you all the and none of that shit's going to make you happy look I run in circles now at this point in my

(40:32) life tons and tons and tons of rich people [ __ ] miserable okay by the way and yet and yet all my working class

(40:40) buddies right who are finally get their vacation 6 months in you know what I mean or kicking back and you go to their

(40:46) house they're floating in a pool with a beer get the [ __ ] in here get in here you know what I mean it's like it's not

(40:53) just the material the materialist message has been a failure it's always been a failure it's always going to come it's always going to go before Wes

(40:59) Watson there was prosperity gospel preachers telling you the same [ __ ] god's going to heal you with the

(41:05) millions god's going to make sure that your slice of pepperoni pizza after this is blessed with the Lord's wealth right

(41:11) they would go absolutely ballistic with this stuff trying to fill this void with

(41:16) materialism which can't be filled by anything other than two things family and purpose the tilos the the the noose

(41:24) and the tilos coming together the family and purpose and that's teology it's Christian ethics is the ability to

(41:30) understand teiology the tilos the purpose of man itself that is the

(41:36) driving force of all virtue and all claims of goodness in the world and that was the opposition message which was

(41:42) given you can't compete with that you there's no competition with that you get

(41:47) destroyed in seconds because because everybody loves their mama right

(41:53) everybody even Badman as they say love their mama and even Wes Watson probably loves his right and the second mama's

(41:59) under threat that purpose right kicks in and it's like all that materialism doesn't mean [ __ ] anymore does it you'll

(42:05) give all Dave Ramsey used to say it's really funny he used to say "A man will

(42:11) sacrifice his health for wealth and then spend all of his wealth to buy back his health." That's so great you get caught

(42:18) You become a snake eating its own tail it's very true that's very true are you are you

(42:25) um what are you worried about with are you are you concerned with the chaos that is the first uh I don't know how

(42:32) many days three months of the Trump um administration i mean here's the thing

(42:38) we knew it was going to be chaos right and some of the things that uh Trump said he wasn't going to do he

(42:44) immediately did but they were all things that we wanted him to do like for instance political revenge okay in my

(42:50) heart of hearts in my you know in my sneaking evil heart of hearts I wanted

(42:56) Trump to get as much political revenge as possible well they were trying they were trying to literally put him in jail

(43:02) for the rest of his life so that's murder that's murder yeah because of the the rhetoric of the left assassins came

(43:08) out to blow his head off at a rally and ended up killing an innocent person they ended up killing an innocent person fire

(43:14) chief hero horrible horrible what they did and all it took was a head turn the

(43:20) guy barely got away you know what I mean and so yeah he woke up the next morning and he went "Fuck this [ __ ] this they're

(43:28) all going down we're getting them all come hell or high water we're getting them all." And people love that [ __ ] we

(43:34) wanted to see it do more of that you know what I mean now on the tariff stuff he gets a lot of [ __ ] for the tariffs

(43:40) they're like "Well why would you put tariffs on Canada why would you put tariffs on Mexico?" It's like "Well if they have free trade agreements with

(43:46) China and we put 100% tariff on China they just access the back door right they can go through Canada canada sells

(43:52) our goods to us io facto they have now bypass the tariff." Like that's obvious

(43:58) stuff right we have these massive deficits with these other nations these trade deficits primarily and China is a

(44:05) huge one right and on the export import front it's like yeah we have an opportunity right now to [ __ ] their

(44:11) emergent economy a future known enemy of the United States of course we're going to do that of course we are and if you

(44:18) need to leverage the entire world stage with economic uh you know doom and gloom

(44:24) if they don't come to the table to assist you with that that's exactly what you're supposed to do that's exactly

(44:30) what we need you to do and that's exactly what he's doing so he gets a lot of [ __ ] right because people are like

(44:35) "Well I don't want to pay more for my you know $15 uh you know uh strap pack

(44:40) or whatever that I go hiking in that was made in [ __ ] China by you know uh third world sweat shop kids now it's

(44:47) going to go up to $17 right?" And it's like well the thing is you don't even know what the uh costbenefit analysis

(44:53) ultimately of these policies will be could be that Chinese factories have to necessarily lower their prices you might

(44:58) get those goods for cheaper in order for them to compete against the tar like you don't know either way a deal will be made right i mean either way it it

(45:05) sounds like something there there's a symbiotic relationship here something can be worked out um and uh that's what

(45:12) it feels like there's been a lot of intellectual property theft from the you know from the United States by China

(45:18) with no consequences there's a lot of that stuff so I'm hoping Well they said what did they say on Joe Rogan's podcast

(45:24) i don't remember who the guest was he made a great point i looked into it he was right he said "Look if you go to a

(45:31) world court okay and than the Chinese do and they want to sue a US company that's

(45:36) US companies showing up for the suit okay they're going to show up they're going to have to defend themselves it's

(45:42) going to go through the court system they have standing it's going to happen you can't sue a Chinese company from America no they don't give a [ __ ] and

(45:48) they don't enforce it." I've got the world who went through that yeah yeah how How's that playing by the rules man

(45:53) how is that coming to the table for you know for for us to be able to even get back intellectual property from our

(46:00) inventors those are our countrymen our blood who invent these wonderful worldchanging products and some little

(46:07) [ __ ] over in China just rips it off right and just dismisses the entire uh

(46:13) reciprocity of being able to like uh go after them for for redress for for

(46:18) stealing this from you and often times here's why that's so dangerous too it's not just the idea oh well they stole the

(46:24) property and they're making it for cheaper it's that you can actually take a product that could be world changing

(46:30) make it so poorly that you destroy its [ __ ] reputation forever forever well

(46:36) but by the other thing is the number of Chinese nationals in AI labs who are de

(46:43) facto spies for the CCP because they don't have a choice when the CCP comes to you and says "Hey you're doing this

(46:50) for us you're not saying no you can't say no so you know the and I've had a

(46:55) couple of people who were whistleblowers in the whole AI thing and worked at uh Open AI for a while and there are it's

(47:03) so competitive among different American companies that they're hiring whoever's the best and a lot of them are Chinese

(47:08) nationals but it's not surprising that Deep Seek and these things have disrupted our whole AI industry because

(47:15) and now you can say open source is good and what I I I don't get into that i do think though that that was probably a

(47:22) result of the fact that they had access to our labs and had access to our technology and and took it took it so

(47:31) you know well and let me make another really rudimentary argument that I also

(47:36) found to be very convincing even though it's so rudimentary you and I would agree that power and the dollar are

(47:43) intertwined that generally if you're a wealthy person you tend to have a lot more power than a person who's not

(47:49) wealthy yes especially if you're in an industry that controls some type of product that people want that's going to

(47:55) necessarily accumulate power well if I have to pick between American moguls who

(48:00) are you know in some way they have to answer to the American people and have to answer to our court system I

(48:07) definitely want them to have the power over any Chinese national who who you

(48:13) know who like if I have to pick between American Bill Gates or you know [ __ ] Chin Woo uh I'm picking Bill Gates right

(48:21) because please don't please don't mock uh Chinese names by saying Chin Wooi there's nobody named Chim Muzie out

(48:27) there for God's sake for God's sake Andrew yeah for what am I thinking what am I thinking i I mean I'm sure that

(48:33) they would be like um no you're 100% That's a great point though that's a great point that's a That's at least at

(48:39) le if if if I have to choose in other words the great evils here for the for like who's going to have to control all

(48:45) of this uh versus who isn't it's like if power necessarily is going to create

(48:50) influence and is going to create power over you know certain infrastructures and certain technologies and this and

(48:55) that I still want it local okay i still want it to be my king right let's go

(49:00) back to your Christian nationalism because your nationalism would mean America first right somewhat

(49:07) protectionist or you still believe in the world market and the open market protectionist protectionist as far as

(49:13) any necessity towards putting America first so if protectionism is necessary

(49:18) for us to get the best deal for our people if protectionism is necessary for us to uh control our own borders if

(49:25) protectionism is a necessary precondition for doing these things then protectionism if uh getting into global

(49:32) you know global markets for some reason perhaps to keep the American dollar very strong or something like that is

(49:38) necessary for the security of the American people then I'm fine with uh with opening up a bit for for global

(49:44) markets and trade and things like that as well so whatever whatever works whatever is best for the prosperity of the American people yes the prosperity

(49:51) of the American people always needs to be the center point so all other the way

(49:57) that I view it through the prism of what America first is supposed to be that all

(50:02) other social ideologies and political ideologies always start with this question is this good for us before it's

(50:10) good for anybody else right it's not good enough that it's equal it's not even good enough that we have a deal

(50:15) where it's good for you and good for us we need to always come out on top of the people first i I go further than that

(50:21) Andrew i say to myself I think the founding fathers solved a political problem and I think of the people for the people and by the people is is and

(50:28) and the great checks and balances the bicameal legislature the the um the fact

(50:35) that we have an executive that we have a judicial branch that we have you know

(50:40) the legislature these are these are and by the way the fourth estate who speaks truth to power these are all great

(50:47) checks and balances these these all are there so that power does not sit or

(50:52) reside or can't be factioned into one particular group so in a lot of ways

(50:58) what I love about the American experiment is that it allows human beings regardless of who you are and

(51:03) where you are it allows Americans and they can be of Chinese descent they can be of Ashkanazi descent they can be of

(51:10) Swedish descent it allows Americans people to realize their potential

(51:16) there's no other system that allows someone to be what they can be what they can imagine themselves to be and most of

(51:23) the world has to deal they they they have to forgo who they could be for who they have to be and that's directly

(51:29) related probably to a lot of factors but mainly that they got it wrong back when

(51:35) and they're holding on to something like a monarchy an oligarchy or whatever it is so in my opinion if you look at the

(51:43) constitution it's it is and even the separation of church and state

(51:48) regardless of how religious you are it is the great document it is the greatest

(51:54) idea in political philosophy far and away and it is because it is so it

(51:59) dovetales so well with the best human nature has to offer and but there was a pre there's a precondition for it to

(52:05) work which was stated by the founders precondition is is that yeah it has to be for a moral population or it can't

(52:11) work yep we didn't we no longer have moral population and you see all western

(52:16) nations which have piggybacked off of constitutional ideas including Mexico who drafts a constitution directly off

(52:22) of ours many European nations also borrowed from it um even even um you

(52:29) know even 150 years ago they were still borrowing from it the problem is you don't have a moral population if you

(52:35) have no moral population what's going to happen necessarily is that we're going to shift in faction into groups and it's

(52:40) exactly what we've done we do not think we have a moral population i think we are I think Americans are are are

(52:46) filling churches back up and everything else i think that we are they're leaving they're leaving the Protestant churches

(52:52) in droves they are moving a little bit more towards traditional churches but look just just 60 70 years ago it was

(52:59) 90% plus who identified as Christian and at least went to church occasionally but

(53:04) whether or not they were going to church they were still at least adopting Christian ethics as being the standard of universal for which all people needed

(53:11) to abide their lives at least to some degree define those define those

(53:17) Christian ethics for us well Christian ethics is going to be broadly uh based around the idea of the

(53:25) covenant laws including the ten commandments the laws that Jesus Christ put down and the general teachings of

(53:32) Jesus Christ into a single ethical system the ethical system itself is

(53:38) going to be in relationship to how human beings both treat each other and how they do a process of law when it comes

(53:45) to an ethical purview everybody's everybody's of the same moral worth due process inherently inherently yes uh

(53:54) things like slavery would be and this is why Christians were so adamant against slavery right and why they were the

(53:59) first to the table for for for abolition especially in Europe and here in the

(54:05) United States even the District of slavery they hated it they

(54:12) thought that it was a kind of black eye uh but that's the way the world worked and a lot of these guys were you know

(54:18) you're at the mercy in some ways to how uh the traditions of the world have operated up until that point up until

(54:24) abolition the whole world operated on slavery for thousands of years and there wasn't I mean that was just the mo of

(54:31) everything but what Christian ethics provides is it provides universal basic ethics universalized in a way that you

(54:38) can justify so you can base the the reasonings behind the things that you

(54:44) ought to do uh along the lines of what the divine commands from almighty God

(54:49) himself were and so now you have uh both justification and an accounting right

(54:54) and when this is applied we get to see something else that's really great the effects and the effects of a Christian

(55:00) and moral populist are fantastic the effects of a secular populace are communism their socialism their secular

(55:08) humanism there are all of these other isms which lead uh towards uh great decadence in society and towards but

(55:15) also also creativity also also creativity yeah in other words well I

(55:20) don't I I would I would argue that creativity when you think of things like beauty and creativity and things like

(55:26) this the inspirations for those things almost always come from love of family

(55:32) from love of family and from or the divine of some kind right the idea that I'm but but that's but that's that's

(55:38) part of the family structure too like with absent family right absent the the idea of uh you know brothers sisters

(55:46) moms dads kids cousins things like that that absent that purpose gets driven out

(55:52) like I I couldn't agree more I mean I think the the the the absence of fathers

(55:57) has been one of the most destructive things in maybe the most destructive thing in this society um but how do you

(56:04) how do Do you um I guess factor the are

(56:10) individual rights and individual liberty is that great against your Christian

(56:15) national philosophy well I so let me I'll untangle it for you i don't believe

(56:22) that rights exist they're not an objective material thing that a

(56:27) conceptualization they're not they they exist nowhere except inside the mind so absent the

(56:33) mind rights are not there anymore but what is left is force even absent all minds the force of nature the force the

(56:40) forces that be are still very much in effect and uh this is a material reality

(56:46) and when you reduce rights down you really are reducing them down to just force the idea is just force and here's

(56:51) why it has to be that way and our founders must have known it because they said a well-regulated militia being

(56:57) necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed right so they're putting in a safeguard

(57:03) here saying that ultimately all of your rights come down to force because if you

(57:10) if you can't enforce what you consider an entitlement to be you don't have an entitlement it's only as strong as the

(57:18) barrel of the gun this was a nation state this is the point of a nation state very important to have a nation

(57:23) state that you can defend you've got to have borders you can defend and that you can identify and collectively agree upon

(57:29) because and a people and a people who belong in those borders that's right otherwise you will you will turn into

(57:35) Cheschna or or the Kurds or the Tibetans or whatever it might be yeah or now modern-day UK where it's being

(57:42) completely invaded in a way which is um which now the the whole multicultural uh

(57:48) project all you have to do is point to the UK and the left shits its pants rightfully so and boy they tried to keep

(57:54) all of the essays under wrap they tried to keep what was going on there for years oh yeah for years and now there's

(58:01) just no more keeping it under wrap because people there are so pissed off that they're speaking out whether you

(58:07) like it or not whether the government likes it or they don't care if you wake the Brits up if you wake the Brits up they there's they they come alive when

(58:12) it comes to soccer and war and uh you want to wake

(58:18) those boys up in uh in the north you know in in Birmingham and Liverpool and

(58:24) all those areas good luck man it's going to be ugly cuz Oh yeah i mean and the Irish too the Irish [ __ ] have been

(58:31) getting into drunken fist fights in the street since they were 13 they don't yet they love it they love it it's their

(58:36) favorite thing in the world no strangers to violence and good at it and good at And by the way and they even incorporate

(58:41) their own rules they're like "All right lads you know you can't stab them right you can't kick them too much while they're down it's just a good

(58:47) oldfashioned bloodying of the nose and then you let them on their way they learned their lesson you send them home

(58:52) to mama right they even the hooligans have even enforced their own decors of how to properly hooligan right so it's

(59:00) like there's a proper way to be a hooligan and an improper way to be a hooligan it's rather unsightly yeah it's

(59:06) rather how dare you yeah yeah yeah yeah so but yeah so but ultimately the point

(59:11) is is like um the the multicultural experiment has failed and it shows you just what the limits of rights are there

(59:17) aren't any there aren't any other than what what it is the push back on that though would be the strength of the United States has been we're we're a

(59:23) nation of immigrants but people forget that we are a nation of immigrants that assimilated around

(59:30) uh a singular way of life right uh um the the Constitution freedom of

(59:36) speech and and the right to bear arms and all these things right i mean well it wasn't I mean yeah I guess you can

(59:43) make the argument it was a nation of immigrants but it was mostly just English and French right it's mostly the Italians i mean the Jews that was later

(59:50) though Italians Irish all that still contributed to a great deal of innovation and the the ethnic Chinese

(59:57) there was this has worked for the most part because people went this is where I

(1:00:03) can become a business owner I can make money I can use my own ingenuity my own effort my own risk-taking and become

(1:00:10) fabulously wealthy or anything I want to be and so the universal ethics the universal ethics right so you take

(1:00:17) Italians just Catholic right you take uh Irish Catholic Right you take the

(1:00:22) universalization and by the way there was shared communities of uh you know Irish and Italians and uh various

(1:00:28) immigrant groups like this who did rally behind uh religion now you but you could

(1:00:33) also take you know good examples of like the Irish and the Dutch who absolutely hated each other because uh you had the

(1:00:39) Irish Catholics and the Dutch Protestant reformers they just they just loathed each other right but they weren't

(1:00:44) arguing over the universals of right and wrong they were arguing mostly over uh

(1:00:51) you know who's in charge of the church do we have you know these are theological baseline theological disputes and they do carry down into

(1:00:58) like people group hatred of the Dutch and Irish still having this rivalry even to this day in Michigan but the

(1:01:04) universal ethics were still there where are they where are they coming from now India you know what are the universal

(1:01:09) ethics from India exactly that are that are going to incorporate in to the ideas

(1:01:15) of a Christian nation what are they going to be I mean these are But I I don't worry about that i don't

(1:01:21) think that somebody from India who comes in and puts education at a premium and starts a startup or a business and takes

(1:01:27) over Google or whatever i I I don't think that's the threat here i think that's our strength because again we've

(1:01:33) got to preserve innovation innovation really is that's probably why the

(1:01:39) separation of church and state makes sense and was put in there because you you you want people your God and

(1:01:47) yourself are a private matter to to quote George Washington loosely um more

(1:01:52) importantly is that you that the potential to be who you want to be uh

(1:02:00) economically especially seems to be the strength of our country to a large degree yay or nay nay i would say well

(1:02:07) here's my here's my argument i lost picture for me by the way um Oh for God's sake i lost picture it's

(1:02:13) outrageous all right yeah outrageous unbelievable yeah i I have to yeah I do I do have to kind of push back and

(1:02:20) disagree on this so at our founding um every every single uh state basically

(1:02:26) had a state religion the 10th amendment is put in to say that any of the

(1:02:33) authorities that are not given to the federal government go to the states respectively the federal government is

(1:02:40) not allowed to make a law governing a national religion that was always supposed to be up to the states and the

(1:02:46) states did that they created a haven uh through religiosity in fact and they

(1:02:52) continued to have state religions uh passed the signing of the constitution

(1:02:58) of the United States and they were well within the rights to do that and they still are within the rights to do that

(1:03:03) so yeah Congress can't make a law which governs uh you know one religion over

(1:03:08) another it can't give a preference to one over the other that's true via the First Amendment but states definitely

(1:03:13) can they're 100% within the rights to do that's what the 10th Amendment was there to do wouldn't that Wouldn't that great against the Constitution and and and

(1:03:21) what Congress says though couldn't really I mean no that it specifically wouldn't right that's what the 10th

(1:03:27) Amendment was there for if the Cong if the federal government doesn't have the authority so Mississippi says we're a Christian state and you've got to adhere

(1:03:34) to Christian rules well they do it now like people people forget about this but they do it now like isn't Utah run by

(1:03:41) Mormons really yeah yes isn't it really the case that the Dutch in Michigan uh

(1:03:46) who are uh Dutch Calvinist reformers hold a lot of the keys to the power yeah it it sure is it's like ultimately

(1:03:54) you're you're you're kind of playing a song and a dance in a way and turning away from the from the obvious right

(1:04:00) which is they're in power anyway and they're going to continue to be in power uh the only distinction What was your

(1:04:06) What was your question they're not public about it they should be so what would your Christian nationalist nation

(1:04:12) look like what would be different uh what what would be different would be the idea that Christians can rule with

(1:04:18) the authority of Christian ethics and that that would be completely totally acceptable and governing laws should be

(1:04:26) formed around those ideas so So abortion would be illegal gay marriage would be illegal yes um um what else

(1:04:34) transgenderism would likely uh take a a rear seat going into the idea of a uh

(1:04:41) social contagion a public health crisis you know the Christians would probably say "Look but say I'm a man and I want

(1:04:48) to wear a dress get up on stage and be a rock and roller i want to wear makeup like David Bowie." What do we do with

(1:04:53) that you don't want to think that localized so this is the beautiful thing about the 10th Amendment right if you

(1:05:00) want to have localized degeneracy you can but other regions right inside the

(1:05:05) United States they may not want that they may not want you to dress in [ __ ] girl gear and go up on stage and

(1:05:11) so it'd be like we'd still have Mississippi Bible belt in San Francisco yeah well I mean what the hell was wrong

(1:05:17) with that you know like honestly what was actually wrong with that did it need to get polluted with degeneracy like did

(1:05:23) we just have to do that were we like "Ah those people over there with their [ __ ]

(1:05:29) morals." It's more about freedom it's more about freedom of expression right that's this is what it comes down to i

(1:05:35) want to express myself the way I want to express myself i want to dye my hair purple and and get breast implants then

(1:05:42) as a as a man then that's what I'm going to do well what are your social obligations do you have any of those though do you have any social duties or

(1:05:48) social obligations where it's not just me me where maybe uh for the purpose of

(1:05:54) social cohesion and for society at whole uh you can express yourselves in ways that don't [ __ ] with the social cohesion

(1:06:00) of everybody else like what about that idea we're always so focused on need well that that's been that was that was

(1:06:07) parsed out with uh with with rights and as long as your rights don't trample on

(1:06:12) my rights uh but then we have to protect against the tyranny of the majority right yeah but those are impossible

(1:06:18) those are impossible to delineate when that's even happening you know what I mean like uh here's a good example you

(1:06:25) you buy a a plot of land and it has a a little river running through it and you dam it up you know what I mean are you

(1:06:30) [ __ ] with everybody else's rights or aren't you right you know I here's and there's the But that par that'd be par

(1:06:37) in the court right yeah well you can sure you can go parse it out in court but you're still just deferring judgment of

(1:06:43) interpretation to when that happens to some other body in authority and it's like ultimately it's almost an

(1:06:50) impossibility to make the delineation of of well my rights begin where yours end

(1:06:55) or yours end where mine began it's like but we we also have duties and obligations we talk a lot about

(1:07:01) entitlements which are rights rights are are going to be an entitlement absent a duty well what duties do you have absent

(1:07:07) entitlements that's my question to you what duties do you have absolutely and I I think what I hear you saying as I

(1:07:12) think about it is that regardless of whether you want to live under Christian ethics you're going to live under some ethics and you're going to live under

(1:07:19) and those ethics will be enforced and you will you will you will engage in a social contract so you're going to be

(1:07:25) forced to do something you may as well choose Christian ethics because that seems to have worked historically

(1:07:31) actually beautiful summary beautiful summary to say the idea is is that

(1:07:36) there's going to be somebody's going to take the sword of power whether you like it or not it might as well be you

(1:07:42) especially when you're dealing with the other side who are a bunch of murderous leftist lunatics uh who focus 100% on

(1:07:51) the degradation social destruction of the core of the family unit and it's like they're also so reductive they're

(1:07:56) also so reductive it's oppressed oppressor it's powerless they're just binary as it gets for a bunch of

(1:08:03) non-binaries they're incredibly binary aren't they though they really [ __ ] are and nuance nuance is always so hard

(1:08:09) oh and and how you what you meant doesn't matter it's what you said they're they made it [ __ ] impossible

(1:08:17) to have discourse yeah yeah through deconstructionism but you know what you can use that weapon back against them

(1:08:23) and I do it often deconstructing their ideas the same way they've attempted to do to us and they're way more absurd

(1:08:29) than anything you could ever say about sky daddy right they worship earth daddy like that's some big you know some big

(1:08:35) revelation they certainly do but the question just becomes this it just becomes and this is a question you I

(1:08:40) would challenge you to do this i would challenge you to get with your closest friends and just ask them this question

(1:08:45) i know what all your rights are i know what all of your entitlements are i know all the things that you deserve and I

(1:08:51) feel like I deserve all those things too but what are your social duties absent in the entitlement what are they and I

(1:08:58) bet you most of them will will tell you they don't have any and if you want to know why society is really as [ __ ] up

(1:09:05) as it is why everything is completely destroyed it's because inside of your home you know that that's not true you

(1:09:11) have tons of duties to your kids and to your wife and to your community even locally you know that right it doesn't

(1:09:17) even have to be spoken about but for some reason when it's applied socially

(1:09:23) uh we just dismiss it we're like "It's all about entitlement it's all about entitlement it's all about entit it's not there's a book there's there's an

(1:09:30) answer to that question that and we'll we'll wrap the with this because I could talk to you all day and and my my

(1:09:35) producer is saying we got to rap because Okay but but this is I could do this all day i enjoy it i love it uh but um so so

(1:09:44) Jonathan height in his book The Righteous Mind would say that your social obligation a liberal would say my

(1:09:49) social obligation is to make sure it's fair and does no harm a conservative has

(1:09:55) a broader moral pallet which is not just does it do harm and is it fair but um

(1:10:00) there's something called sanctity there's something called uh respect for authority uh and there's loyalty um and

(1:10:08) those those are also things so patriotism is a form of loyalty uh you

(1:10:13) you you get a lot from this country whether you know it or not and it behooves you to know what you get and

(1:10:19) know what you would be missing if you lived in another country which is what makes me such a patriot about I I lived

(1:10:25) in all over the world and I know I would just add the one qualifier that all Christians universally have a duty to

(1:10:32) resist evil a duty to resist evil and so when you ask the question what if I want

(1:10:40) to be a rock star and come in and sniff cocaine off of a woman's [ __ ] boobs in a dress right isn't that my god-given

(1:10:46) right it's like no no it's not and I think that Christians universally can resist that by saying that's demonosis

(1:10:53) and we're going to resist evil that that is a core foundational principle that we've forgotten we're supposed to resist

(1:11:00) evil you know uh I think it was Paul who said temptation and evil is like a roaring lion always circling it's always

(1:11:07) there the apple's always there you always want to take a nibble at least a little nibble and I I'll quote Jordan

(1:11:13) Peterson i think about this all the time including us we do you and I% you and I do i might be the worst it's a constant

(1:11:20) I'm I'm constantly white knuckling but that's why we say in Orthodoxy chief of sinners right here chief of sinners the

(1:11:26) chief the worst it's You can sniff cocaine off the vagina of a of a lady or

(1:11:32) whatever you can It's not going to work out though and Jordan Peterson said "In my 35 years of of you know being a

(1:11:39) psychoanalyst I've never seen anyone get away with even one thing even once at

(1:11:45) the end of the day you're going to twist the fabric of reality but when you're when the [ __ ] hits the fan I'm going to

(1:11:51) be able to trace it all the way back to this decision you made when you try to take a shortcut and I and if I could go

(1:11:56) back in time and talk to myself I would have said "Brian you're not going to get away with a [ __ ] thing even once

(1:12:02) you'll pay in full for what you have done and what you haven't done and especially what you haven't done work

(1:12:08) harder with interest tell tell the [ __ ] truth all the way across the

(1:12:13) board and do what's hard do what you're supposed to not what you want to good

(1:12:18) luck with that by the way good luck with that but hey this this is that's probably my argument for at least the

(1:12:26) things that you you uh you are behind which would be Christian ethics um I

(1:12:31) think it'll work out for you in a better way doesn't mean we shouldn't be uh creative though and a little bit naughty

(1:12:39) andrew Wilson as always great to uh great to see your beard great to see some color in your face looks like

(1:12:45) you're working out your shoulders are looking a little more rounded your traps your neck i'm impressed we're getting

(1:12:51) there man we're getting there and uh thank you so much for having me on Brian i really appreciate it you have a standing invite i love having you on

(1:12:58) anytime [Music]
