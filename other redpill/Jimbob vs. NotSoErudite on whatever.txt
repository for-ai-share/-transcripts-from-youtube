(1:02) further ado I'm going to introduce our two debaters i'm joined today by Jim Bob he is a political commentator and

(1:09) political cartoonist for the Washington oh my Washington Examiner also joining us

(1:17) today is Kyla or as she goes online not so aerodite she has a undergraduate

(1:24) degree in psychology and a graduate diploma in psychometrics she's a content creator streamer and political

(1:31) commentator thank you both for joining me today the topic of today's debate is feminism and we've kind of uh

(1:38) spontaneously possibly added a few other prompts to uh you will each have a five

(1:44) up to a 5minute opening statement the rest of the show will be open conversation with a few breaks for

(1:49) audience messages at the end you will each have up to a fiveminut closing statement and Jim Bob we're going to

(1:56) have you do your opening statement first sure go ahead all right well feminism at

() 

(2:01) least broadly stated is the advocacy of equality of sexes um definitionally that

(2:08) would be a movement away from uh a society that has men in power i would

(2:13) call that uh patriarchy men holding the power and women are largely excluded from those positions um I see an

(2:21) immediate contradiction um it would be up to my opponent tonight to redefine feminism to maybe uh get away from this

(2:28) contradiction but if feminism is some type of movement away from male power or

(2:34) a patriarchy then any form of feminism that I can point to or I think my

(2:39) opponent uh my opponent can point to relies on that same power so for example

(2:45) if we go back to the uh even the 18th amendment before they had voting they appealed to men right um when the 19th

(2:53) amendment came along they were actually still appealing to men so the question is well is that a movement toward

(3:00) feminism or is it just affirming the power that men actually have and sort of asking like a parent can they have a

(3:07) larger allowance this week i think it's the latter um the funny thing about feminism is that while it's rooted in

(3:14) this sentiment that the patriarchy is this authoritative oppressive regime um

(3:20) if we look back maybe maybe around the 80s and and onward the voting patterns

(3:26) ironically uh from women are highly tilted toward expanding authoritative

(3:31) government power which is kind of a funny irony the sentiment again is men

(3:37) oppress we got to break the oppressive uh uh patterns of society and yet all of

(3:42) their voting patterns actually points to the opposite expanding government authority which I another irony is that

(3:48) that government authority is mostly men um the feminist screeches about liberty and autonomy then votes for more

(3:54) government intrusion um now while we heard uh plenty from Andrew Wilson on the force doctrine it is definitely an

(4:02) undefeated argument even if you got a gorilla to deliver the argument in sign

(4:07) language it would still be better than any feminist argument I've ever heard however we won't uh beat that horse to

(4:14) death but I do want to include it in the in the debate um I also want to include

(4:19) that uh that feminism largely defined today the metrics for feminism the

(4:25) metrics for liberty the the metrics for well-being is often placed on just mere

(4:30) uh maybe economic liberalism or or some sort of outcomebased u system that's measuring materialism

(4:39) um some type of wealth um some type of mobility economically

(4:46) um and it's rooted in consumerism which is kind of funny because uh the movement

(4:52) uh that feminism made throughout the last couple hundred years coincided with

(4:58) uh a predominantly malrun industriist um um part of society um the industrialists

(5:06) uh maybe they looked at the women and said "Huh that's a whole other taxable

(5:11) uh income right there they're just sitting ducks right?" in you know safe in their home raising the children we

(5:17) got to get them out of let's get them in the workplace let's get them with debt and lo and behold uh many years later uh

(5:23) women I think now the percent is about 75% uh women hold 75% of the consumer

(5:30) debt now so you know my opponent might uh define feminism as a good thing

(5:37) because it produces well-being i would argue even with the debt um holding debt

(5:43) even the stress of debt uh as a man holding debt uh the kind of stress that could put on you I don't think that

(5:48) would add too much to your well-being there's other metrics you could look at to argue that the well-being is actually

(5:54) not great with the pursuit of pure materialism um so if my opponent tonight

(5:59) offers a metric for the good rooted only in material outcomes uh consumer

(6:06) outcomes buying purchasing power uh this type of thing I would just point out

(6:11) that the goodness of a society cannot be reduced and should not be reduced to strict materialism um let's see what

(6:19) else um the other question is what's the payoff so when we uh advocate uh the the

(6:26) the basic feminist talking point is liberate the woman from this terrible

(6:32) home uh situation that they're in they're they're a slave to their man they're a slave to their husband they're

(6:38) a slave to their children i don't see many alternatives the alternative that I've seen in the last 30 years is mostly

(6:45) uh being a slave to uh more of a stranger of a man who's a CEO um and

(6:51) your home becomes the office and uh I'm not sure what the trade-off is because what what happens with feminists is they

(6:58) basically forfeit their fertile years and then you know 20 years later they

(7:04) wake up they're 44 they have wine stained teeth they have seven cats and they're wondering where all the men are

(7:09) where are all the good men well I'll tell you where the good men are they're already married and they're married to women who rejected feminism and lucky

(7:17) for them they have children they have a legacy they have something bigger to live into than strict material uh wants

(7:24) and desires um so with that said I just want to point out one more time the

(7:30) contradiction that's in feminism and I don't know if my opponent will be able to get out of this if feminism is merely

(7:36) the advocacy of equality of sexes but it depends on a structure that is

(7:42) demonstrable inequal it's it demonstrates inequality of the se the sexes um that is the society we live in

(7:50) so in a weird roundabout way any concept or application of feminism appeals to

(7:56) patriarchy so in a rhetorical sense feminism is still patriarchal it's it's

(8:02) it can't avoid it patriarchy is a natural description of reality to argue

(8:08) for feminism is to argue with reality and I think uh the way feminists

(8:13) generally argue uh the way they generally live seems to be consistent with a constant rejection of reality

(8:21) okay Kylo what about you for your opening statement awesome so I'm super appreciative uh Jim and I talked

(8:27) beforehand just to make sure that for the viewers we gave them a slightly different conversation cuz I know this is like feminism two for people who

(8:35) watched the previous debate um so maybe what I'll try to do in my intro is maybe

(8:41) outline where my feminism maybe differs from others um and we can kind of get into that um and kind of break down

(8:50) basically what I would view as like good feminism versus bad feminists so feminism to me is a like a construct and

(8:57) an idea um and so within the idea there is people there are feminists and some

(9:02) of them are great like Simone Deavois love her um and Dichi is an incredible writer and

(9:09) there are bad feminists um just like any movement and any idea the idea to me of feminism um I think it started out as

(9:16) this idea of equality for sexes and I think that that was important for the first initial waves i don't I don't

(9:22) think feminists are being super honest with themselves if they say that that's what it's for now because I think we've achieved a lot of equality women by and

(9:29) large have the same access to opportunities as men there are a couple of like soft cultural limits that I

(9:35) would agree to there's some certain cultural patriarchal elements that I think might still inhibit women a little bit um but by and large women can go to

(9:42) school they can get a job they can apply for any job that a man can um they essentially have all the same freedoms

(9:49) of opportunities that men do which is awesome um I think what feminism is doing now and should be focused on is

(9:56) essentially what I label feminism as which is a um hold on I'll pull it up

(10:02) empowerment of women um and a promotion of femininity and maybe for this conversation we can focus specifically

(10:09) at least for me on the promotion of femininity um because I think that that's the area that needs the most work

(10:14) um I think third-wave feminism did a really good job at stretching the boundaries of what it meant to be a

(10:20) woman i think it opened up a lot of more masculine traditional w roles for women that women couldn't really occupy before

(10:28) um but I don't think that feminism's done a very good job of building its own

(10:33) table um and that's what a lot of fourthwave feminists kind of advocate

(10:39) for is this kind of building of a new table and a promotion of femininity that isn't reliant on just like engaging in

(10:46) hyper masculine structures um feminism that I don't stand by there's a lot of

(10:52) feminists for example that um basically dismiss all male- related issues they think bisandry doesn't matter um I

(10:59) reject those feminists we don't agree um there are certain kind of dorkanites for

(11:04) example who um I would say just Missandry feels like

(11:11) not even enough to describe the level of hatred she has for men i am not a dorkanite i don't apply to her ideas and

(11:17) like Gloria Steinum um she's a classical thirdwave kind of lib feminist she's

(11:23) very fixated on just like women getting into careers and that's kind of it she's um yeah very fixated on women in careers

(11:30) and I don't care about that other than if women want to go into careers that they can um so that would be my form of

(11:37) feminism i know that I didn't address a lot of your opening statement but I did write it down so if you want to go back to anything we totally can um but yeah I

(11:44) I think the feminism that focus focuses on promotion of femininity would be the most good for women now okay so you said

() 

(11:51) empowerment and femininity so let's do empowerment first could you define

(11:58) empowerment from your perspective yeah so for me empowerment of women would be like removing obstacles for opportunity

(12:06) okay mhm so from your feminist view of empowerment plus femininity would you

(12:12) say it's empower empowering for women to stay home and be mothers it can be if that's what they choose yeah okay and so

(12:20) is it if it's empowering for women to choose and they're choosing based on

(12:25) their femininity if it actually produced uh a large disparity where women

(12:30) actually found positions in society that were maybe lower in power um

(12:36) administrative helping teaching mothering if that was the outcome of pure choice um you wouldn't you wouldn't

(12:45) declare that there's some inequality or injustice between the disparity of men in power and women in lower positions i

(12:52) think you bring up a really good point in more egalitarian societies we actually often see women trending towards more fem traditional roles like

(12:59) women tend to want to be nurses and teachers more often you see this in like Scandinavian countries and I will say for the caveat some people dispute that

(13:06) evidence um the evidence when I look at it seems pretty robust so yeah I think women will often still trend towards

(13:12) some of those traditional gender roles which I'm totally for i just want to make sure that they're choosing it and that the women who wouldn't be choosing

(13:19) that have the opportunity to choose something else okay and then is there any reason from your view choosing to be

(13:25) a mother at home and a wife is there any reason you could see that that's actually more empowering than an

(13:31) alternative for instance let me give you a strict example sure if a woman that you knew and loved for instance relative

(13:39) or friend said "You know what i'm really drawn to being a mother i really am drawn to the traditional structure of

(13:45) life uh I could just really see myself raising like five kids but there's this

(13:51) other impulse of me that wants to just start an Only Fans i don't know what it is about it." like from a feminist view

(13:58) that you're defending today is it is it either or is fine or is one better for

(14:04) her and better for society i think that's a good question so when I think about like what's the best choice for

(14:09) somebody I break it into three things which is the choices you make should be something that your past self your

(14:15) present self and your future self will consent to and like right and so I think when you're posing this question the

(14:21) only fans option has a lot of potential acute short-term gain a fuckload of money obviously but the important

(14:29) question is will your future self consent to that and like it and I think that's a really big question and I think

(14:34) the answer for some women is yes i have met like a girl is a good example of somebody who I think has said yes to the

(14:40) only fan sex work thing and it seems to genuinely bring a lot of fruit to her life but I think for like a lot of women

(14:47) that kind of get romanticized into sex work they forget about their future

(14:52) selves because they think their future selves will be grateful for all the money when in reality most women that do do Only Fans don't make that much money

(14:59) and also you have to deal with the fact that your sex and body is is okay from

(15:04) the answer it sounds like the lens you're using to determine your answer is purely individualistic

(15:11) uh it's it's decently individualistic i would agree with that so if it is mostly

(15:17) individualistic and if your position in this debate anyway is you're taking the

(15:23) affirmative that feminism is good for society which is beyond individualistic right so now you have to add in one more

(15:30) variable when you're coaching your friend here um because what they determine they might like or not like in

(15:37) the future may not be uh tied directly necessarily to what's best for society

(15:44) yep I would agree the the caveat to that that I would basically poke is if individualism doesn't lead to a

(15:50) flourishing society then why is it the case that the most individualistic country i.e america is one of the most

(15:55) predominant countries in the world and so I understand what you're saying there's a certain level of responsibility we should have to our

(16:00) community essentially um I just think that individualism often seems to

(16:06) somehow I'm not even sure exactly the process uh do this to some degree um which is why we have most

(16:12) individualistic nations being the the strongest most kind of happiest highest

(16:18) GDP all all the all the factors of goodness for this i mean if you define

() 

(16:24) good as merely productive um you could definitely do counterarguments of like

(16:30) let's say Epstein Island got off the ground and uh it's actually logically

(16:35) and practically possible for you to do horrific things in a society and still

(16:40) produce a high GDP GDP but the other aspect of what you just said is um that

(16:47) individualism if it produces all of these goods but what's best for society

(16:53) uh as a necessity is replacing your population would you agree that we're not doing good in replacing our

(17:00) population uh yeah I think birth rates being low is it's very tied to kind of

(17:06) like liberal financial success uh and it's it's harmful i just don't think

(17:12) it's fundamentally tied i think actually going to Israel and seeing all these like liberal left-leaning Jewish people

(17:17) having 90,000 babies um is a very it's very interesting it's a very big counter

(17:23) to the standard liberal of like the more money a country makes the less well the reason I brought that up is if the next

(17:30) generation of children and the generation after that is a necessity a a necessary component for a good society

(17:36) regardless of what we agree on good is if that's necessary I would argue that

(17:42) every form of feminism that I've seen which is largely tied to individualism

(17:47) um doesn't actually have a way of advocating for that in a meaningful way so the philosophy itself is missing what

(17:53) I would call deontology or in simple terms any duties so any feminism you

(18:01) don't like that I also don't like there's no duties there's no real true duties to say you're a feminist and even

(18:08) in the the version that you're proposing that's anti those other crazy ones right you're against these crazy ones even

(18:14) your position there's no act there's no real duty for a woman who's a feminist

(18:19) to produce the next generation and so this is why I I measure it up against other cultures or other uh uh worldviews

(18:27) in this case Christianity has a built-in not that this debate is feminism verse Christianity I just want to bring it as

(18:33) a a reference is the missing element of duties there's no obligation for you to

(18:40) influence another woman to have a child in in a meaningful nudging way right you

(18:46) know like nudging i'm not talking about force i'm not talking about punishment for not promotion of it yeah yeah super

(18:51) propagandized right it you would agree that feminism largely from the start

(18:57) until now is not only I wouldn't say indifferent to family but actually

(19:03) advocates against it the one you're arguing for as I as I understand it you're like "No I've met a lot of

(19:09) feminists who want to have kids they're ant they're not this anti-natalist like group

(19:15) you'd have to concede that the most part the propaganda that we see the dominant the dominant narrative is basically

(19:22) anti-f family anti-child pro boss babe go get it girl sell your body girl you

(19:28) if you got it flaunt it this kind of thing right and the the reason I bring this up is that that kind of narrative

(19:35) that kind of worldview is purely self-centered and doesn't actually produce what's necessary for a thriving

(19:42) society so even if I granted you I don't concede to your metrics of what's good but even if I granted you the whole

(19:48) thing like oh well-being happiness this everything you could add right money

(19:54) housing whatever you whatever you want to add in there it's all fairly meaningless if there's not a

(20:01) component that values uh reproducing society itself as a virtue even so

(20:07) feminism itself has no virtues uh I wouldn't say feminism has no virtues it

() 

(20:13) definitely has virtues i think there's a I think there's a valid critique which is saying feminism doesn't celebrate

(20:19) motherhood enough i agree with that i think it's complicated when you look at

(20:25) antiatalism because antiatalism isn't a purely feminist thing there's a number

(20:30) of different philosophies and worldviews that are antiatalist right um communism would be another example of one that

(20:36) tends to be often be very antiatalist um and I think antiatalism is is death

(20:41) culty behavior i think it's it's very hard can I interrupt you i want to ask you why do you think it is that feminism

(20:47) I agree there's antiatalists that maybe aren't feminists but why do you think it is that most feminists and the history

(20:54) of feminism is largely inextricably tied to an anti-natalist sentiment that's a

(21:00) really good question so this might be where we first uh differ pretty significantly i think a large reason for

(21:05) why feminism has been so anti-natalist is because the family and the duty of

(21:11) motherhood has been weaponized historically as a chain to enforce women

(21:16) stay home not be able to work and not be able to basically like autonomy sure

(21:22) before uh and during the suffragette movement do you know that primarily the

(21:27) women who were uh being challenged to maybe grab their vote they opposed it

(21:33) yep willfully yep happily and they they weren't uh under the impression that

(21:38) they were chained to their husband's uh lazy boy right they took a position that

(21:46) not only one they didn't want the um the guarantor position of let's say credit

(21:52) um they didn't want to be able to be also drafted and put into dangerous situations they also had a a nice uh

(22:00) hearty moral uh lens that they all shared they were sort of like the moral

(22:05) barometers of the time and so they were actually I would argue that prefeminism especially during that time frame where

(22:12) the let's face it the really ugly women who couldn't find husbands were like we need power right they have power these

(22:20) other women are getting married all of the married women that you say are chained to their husbands right they

(22:26) came out and said "We don't want the vote." The suffragette movement actually stopped tried to physically stop them

(22:32) from showing up to vote against their own vote so why is it that the majority

(22:38) of women at that time didn't share the sentiment that they were enslaved if they were enslaved wouldn't they be

(22:44) coming out and saying "Free us free us from this terrible atrocity called motherhood." Well it's a little bit of a

(22:51) misnomer to tie their aversion to getting the vote to them claiming that

(22:56) they're not chained necessarily right their aversion to the vote was specifically because of drafting and

(23:02) some concerns about debt however as the suffragette movement started taking off and women realized that black men were

(23:08) going to get the vote they began flocking towards the suffragette movement and became largely embraced and

(23:13) so while I would agree that the early suffragettes were some of the most dislikable women on the planet that

(23:19) doesn't change the fact that as time goes on it very quickly becomes a deeply

(23:24) subsumed belief that increasingly most women across North America desired okay

(23:30) and I put it in my opening the increase of women voting uh the sentiment is more

(23:36) power um challenging the man equal equalizing the power offsetting the

(23:41) disparity of power do you find it a bit ironic that every that predominantly

(23:47) what women vote for enhances the power of of of man essentially because you're

(23:52) talking about big government essentially getting increases like welfare state i just think it's disanalogous to compare these two things i don't I don't think

(23:59) that um like social safety networks for example is in any What about gun laws

(24:06) yeah I would agree that gun laws are are more controlling the issue is that regulation the reason that people like

() 

(24:12) desire regulation is not necessarily in in in confluence or in um sorry I'm

(24:19) getting tired so I'm losing my words it's it's not uh in dissonance with wanting freedom right there's this idea

(24:26) it's actually popular within the church that to have true freedom you need some level of like structure and like systems

(24:31) around you and so most liberals who are pro institutions and pro welfare states

(24:38) are also very pro- freedom these two things aren't inherently disanalogous do you do you think that there's something

(24:43) about the nature ontology of women females uh that they're drawn to voting

(24:49) for more safe things uh against liberty against um basically

(24:55) like here's a way of putting it rhetorically when women vote largely they're voting for basically a daycare

(25:02) center they're like vic they're they want society because it's their nature to to basically look like a safe room

(25:09) where no one gets hurt because they see the world as kind of their their children and that's actually a good

(25:14) trait it's just that it's misdirected this is why the the question of the nature of men and women uh which we'll

(25:21) get into gender roles uh in society that the nature of men and women actually

(25:26) directs and informs where they end up in the world in society and so I think the feminist movement is some type of

(25:33) reaction that um tries to compensate for some perception of like uh inequality

(25:40) but then overcompensates and throws women into situations where they really

(25:45) they wouldn't end up if if the choice was there anyway for the most part yeah but the key part of the key element is

() 

(25:51) the choice right like choice and free will and ability to self-determine is

(25:57) like one of the most fundamental it's one of the most fundamental things to our faith as well is this idea of free

(26:02) will and salvation can a blind person use their free will to get the pilot job

(26:08) no okay so there are limitations right yeah of course there's biological limitations but that's what I'm talking about it's not the will if I could just

(26:14) answer you just a little bit at length because you said a number of things so to respond to your like care orientation in voting I would agree that in general

(26:21) women tend to vote left and seem to be very careoriented i just think that that's a good thing about society i

(26:27) think a society that takes care of people who can't take care of themselves very well is good right i I believe in

(26:33) social safety networks I think that they're valuable to society and I think the fact that women brought that into

(26:38) our policies is good while I'd also grant you that there are elements of major overstep for example gun laws i am

(26:45) not actually opposed to gun laws i just think what happens with gun laws for example is the people that advocate them

(26:52) have no sophistication in gun technology okay so the well yeah women generally uh

(26:57) speaking don't have knowledge of how to operate the a gun or have the strength to even operate a gun for the most part

(27:04) and they're voting for gun laws and they don't know anything about guns so that's what I'm pointing to is that their

(27:10) nature is actually towards safety but they're actually asking men to uh

(27:16) basically legislate the safety and enforce the safety well they're asking authority is men well if feminism is if

(27:24) feminism is is a thing right that you're arguing for definitionally like I talked I asked you

(27:31) before the debate is there a correction going on so if feminism exists it starts

(27:36) with the assumption that there's some sort of inequality something that needs to be corrected or even lightly that

(27:42) there's a disparity of power in the balance right a balance of power can I ask you a question let's go back in the

(27:48) 1920s could women own land i don't think so could they uh go to school of their own free choice um I'm not sure about

(27:56) that one i know that uh some of them could work there's a myth that they couldn't work i'm not sure what year um

(28:03) but leading you know as time goes on they didn't even get credit cards until 1970 sure i guess maybe a follow-up

(28:10) question to that would be you probably don't think it's good that women can work or have land i don't want to put

(28:16) words in your mouth is that I don't even think it's good that all men uh uh uh

(28:21) necessarily uh should vote if like cuz land and voting all these things were tied together back then and so um the

(28:29) land question is should women have land well if you bought the land what do you

(28:34) have land for it's like you're you're not going to be the one defending it ultimately it's going to be a man defending it so it's going to be fiat

(28:40) defending it right and I I I don't What do you mean wait what do you mean by that well what I mean by that is this idea where what you'll you're talking

(28:46) about the enforcement arm and we've talked about this before i think it's a very silly idea to basically steal the

() 

(28:52) valor of a small select group of young able-bodied men who have a penchant for

(28:57) violence who are willing to enact order as saying that this is like men doing this thing so it's like well sort of but

(29:03) it's specifically it's the same men wait the same you're relying on do you get any of your feminist policy passed

(29:10) without the young strapping group of men with a pension for violence yes most No you don't no you don't yeah most policy

(29:17) isn't passed through violence uh no it's enforced with violence u all policy is enforced with vi violence so no hold on

(29:24) hold on if you pass if you pass a policy men don't get to steal valor from other men hold on a second there's no valor

(29:30) we're not talking about valor the point is that there's a difference between a group of men and a group of women we're

(29:36) not saying that because a group of men uh hold this position of power that these other men get the some type of

(29:43) privilege right we're saying that men collectively descriptively that you're you're trying to say "Oh a pension for

(29:50) violence." As if that's a bad thing like it's not a bad thing so it's like hold on just to be clear I don't think that's

(29:55) a bad thing well it it it sounded like a porative no that that would only be because if you think that I think

(30:01) violence is inherently evil which I don't i like cops and soldiers so you agree that when a if a woman had the

(30:07) money to buy land you would agree that she couldn't actually defend it from intruders well with guns she probably

(30:14) decently could but the reality is that the man would be able to defend it pretty similarly especially with guns okay here's my question if the

(30:21) landowning situation is a microcosm of society does the man in your view of

(30:28) feminism have an obligation to defend anything if he owns is he the land owner any man any man in society whether it's

(30:36) at the land level or a stranger a stranger walking down the street this is a really good clarifying question most

(30:41) men don't have the obligation the men that do are the the individuals who join the enforcement arm as your authority

(30:46) that's actually not true well typically the police are required to respond no well no respond to a crime the police

(30:52) actually have no obligation in the US to defend your property or your body well they they do to an extent right like

(30:59) most cops Well most cops don't intervene because it's No it's a Supreme Court case Colorado um there's another one

(31:06) it's the whole protect and serve thing this is like uh people conflate this they think the cops are legally bound or

(31:14) somehow obligated to protect you and your property they're actually not their job is to respond to a violation of law

(31:22) or or something else so the violation could be someone hurt you the violation

(31:27) could be someone stole something but as far as defending it the obligation is for you and your family to defend your

(31:34) life and others and so that this is why I asked question to be clear though this is really muddy right because depending on the state that you're in the your

(31:41) ability to defend your land is actually very criminally questionable because in some states you can't really defend your

(31:46) land right and so this idea that you're saying like cops don't have to defend you why is that well hold on hold on just let me finish my thoughts right in

(31:53) the case of cops you're right they you can't call them beforehand well actually you can a lot of the time a lot of times

(31:59) say you have a trespasser you don't even have to defend your land you can often times call the cops as long as you have a sign up and they can show up and kick

(32:05) you off the land that's when they show up be the cop protecting your land you protect that's if they show up well they

(32:12) usually do it no no no look anytime there's an Do you know how many self-defense instances are reported in

(32:18) the US alone i'm sure super high which is why there's lessions yeah I'm not opposed to self-defense hold on a second

(32:23) no but you are opposed to self-defense well why is it that if you're defending feminism and that that includes females

() 

(32:30) voting and females vote with patterns that lead to people's inability to use

(32:35) their own weapon is that a good thing this you're just creating like this no no no i want to ask you a question is it

(32:41) a good thing if the government passes legislation where a man or a woman uh

(32:47) has constrained ability to defend themselves it's it you would have to give me the exact specific is it a

(32:53) generally a good thing for society to restrict one's capability of using a gun

(33:00) in their pocket as self-defense again there's I actually can't give you

(33:05) a super clear there are going to be instances where I think using a gun for self-defense is bad like I don't like Florida's stand your ground policy but

(33:12) there are also where you should be able to if there's over a million and that's only the ones that are reported uses per

(33:19) year of self-defense with a gun in the US okay if that person wasn't allowed to use

(33:27) their gun in those instances would that be a good thing or a bad thing that would be you for most of those cases a

(33:32) bad thing okay if women voting results mo progressively in those instances not

(33:39) being able to to to occur because of restrictive gun laws is that a good thing or a bad thing this is just too

(33:45) reductive to say it's not it's it's not reductive because the stats show it women vote in favor tilted highly to uh

(33:54) higher constraint of liberty and uh especially regarding guns they're like guns scary yeah but so do like black men

(34:01) at a higher level and black women and older generations especially this last election also tend to like vote in this

(34:07) direction so when you're like reducing these voting things which are very multi if you could just let me finish my

(34:13) thoughts no the disparity with men and men is not the same as women though if you don't mind just let me finish my thoughts what you're doing though is

(34:19) you're taking these extremely complicated multifaceted policy things and you're reducing it down to man verse

(34:25) women when that's not really the lens by which you should be analyzing things like self-defense law why not be-

(34:31) because it it's not helpful in any Why are you saying it's multifaceted if I can demonstrate statistically that women

(34:38) collectively voting vote toward uh gun legislation and other things that

(34:44) restrict your ability to defend yourself and men even if you found men that didn't the disparity between men and

(34:50) women is is is astounding as far as those laws sure but that would then be

(34:55) presupposing that the women voting that way are specifically because they want to reduce your self-defense things where No it's their nature i'm not blaming

(35:02) them for nature to reduce self-defense no no no their nature is to uh vote and

(35:08) act in uh defense in nurturing and protect in protection kind of thing sure

(35:14) most women would actually probably be like most feminists for example I think the gun is like the greatest feminist equalizer ever right a lot of feminists

(35:21) are very pro- self-defense for pretty obvious reasons yeah but the that doesn't deal with the fact that when

(35:28) women vote even if I granted you those awesome women they're not voting for self-defense they're typically going to

(35:33) be voting for things like abortion policy and like why is it that they vote in favor of policies that restrict your

(35:40) ability to for self-defense they don't vote in favor of policies that would restrict your self-defense they typically vote for Democrat uh

(35:47) politicians who embody their values more at a broad caretaking okay so got it so

(35:52) women vote not based on particular things that they look into but a general feeling of the person who's talking

(35:58) embodies their value that's even a worse argument for I don't know why you're stronging me like that like what is it

(36:03) they're discerning from the what's an embodiment well when you look at a politician and

(36:09) you're deciding to vote for them most people are like one to three main things that they vote for it's usually for

(36:15) women some level of women's rights economy and housing crisis especially in the last election right and so when

(36:21) they're looking at a politician that they're deciding on those are typically the top three things that they're deciding to vote for they're not like

(36:27) going down the line and being like "Man does this person let me do self-defense or not?" In fact a lot of women will rail against Democrats when they try to

(36:34) I know but this is really bizarre because the narrative from women is that men are dangerous and they you know you

(36:40) got to watch out for men and I agree men are dangerous you should watch out for men but the thing is it's bizarre to

(36:46) have a narrative that uh primarily is uh women need to be be protected men are

(36:52) dangerous uh we got to look at this assault stuff uh people are essayed all the time and then to prioritize voting

(37:00) based on what like if the outcome of voting is that not only you as a woman

(37:05) can't prop legally use a gun but also men can't use a gun to even protect you

(37:11) properly what are they prioritizing above that uh things like housing crisis

(37:16) and economy that's what women voted for i thought feminist I thought feminism sorted that out

(37:23) what when when has feminism had always economic policy your argument for

(37:29) feminism being good is based on uh the economy yeah but that's not the same

(37:36) thing as women voting for the like using feminism as an economic analysis let's

(37:41) do it this way what do you think from your view of feminism is the most important issue given that you have a

(37:48) vote the most the single most like the top the top of the top sorry can you say

(37:54) that again what's the most important thing from your feminist view not the one not the way i don't feminism is not

(38:00) the main thing that makes me vote it's usually economic policy and foreign policy i vote for foreign policy mostly

(38:05) foreign policy yeah i care a lot about foreign policy okay yeah so like sovereignty i care a lot about

(38:10) sovereignty okay so if there was something to vote for for feminists

(38:16) you're going to say vote based on uh foreign policy uh I would be most for most women I would say probably feminism

(38:22) shouldn't be your number one priority i think like the housing crisis and the wealth disparity is a much bigger issue than like cultural patriarchy and I

(38:28) think you've got like your your your being a gender opportunist you're fixating on the wrong thing i think feminists voting for like purely

(38:35) feminist stuff um isn't even that common again most women this election voted for

(38:41) uh housing uh economy and then after that was abortion rights okay so I guess

(38:47) I'm going to ask you what is there a correct feminist view no feminism is

(38:53) like a a constant moving concept that's developing through conversation like

(38:58) most philosophical concepts so if concepts there's no correct concept for

(39:03) feminism meaning that means that there's no correct application for feminism

(39:09) there's no when you say correct I guess I'm answering it in like there isn't a perfectly fixed idea of what feminism is

(39:15) because feminism is fundamentally a dialogue like most philosophies right okay but dialogues don't uh make

(39:22) societies run so like I obviously think my version of feminism is the best version of feminism but that doesn't

(39:29) mean it like is there any standard that determines your version of feminism is

() 

(39:35) the best or the correct one i think it's the most uh consistent i think it leads to the highest level of like opportunity

(39:41) and flourishing for both like men and women but mostly for women okay yeah the thing is if you say it's just a concept

(39:48) like premise one is feminism is just a concept premise two it's a dialogue like

(39:55) the follow of those two right if it's just a concept and just a dialogue then when we ask what the application is that

(40:02) means like let's like use an analogy um I design a car that's just a concept in

(40:08) the computer and then I go okay it's a concept but it can be turned into

(40:14) reality and so what I'm asking asking you is what is your concept of feminism

(40:21) and how is it accurately or appropriately applied to society because if it's just a

(40:27) concept just concepts do we agree concepts themselves don't make reality function right yeah I no I totally

(40:34) disagree with that I think like social normative concepts are like the backbone by which zeitgeist emerge like I think

(40:40) the way that we view the world is rooted in concepts does a concept act on matter

(40:46) uh through people sort of yeah like like it depends on what you mean by act on matter right me sitting here talking

(40:52) about feminism am I acting on matter okay look are you a concept or are you a material body i'm a person okay are you

(41:00) a material body yes okay so concepts do concepts knock over cups

(41:07) are you familiar with Plato i'm not I'll just ask you a question does a concept knock over a cup

(41:12) um it depends on what you mean by sort of no my hand does but like the idea can

(41:18) you knock over a cup with a concept no it's it's immaterial gotcha so if concepts immaterial

(41:24) um concepts being that they can't knock over a cup a concept can't actually build society that I I'm sorry what's

(41:32) What's democracy like concepts democracy is force no it's not yes it is democracy

(41:38) started as a as a political philosophy right con I I don't know i don't I don't know what you do with philosophy if you

(41:44) think that concepts don't emerge and affect reality i didn't say concepts don't have a relation to reality i'm

(41:51) making a distinction because you said feminism is just a concept if it's just a concept it's a dialogue it's an action

(41:58) if it Well that's what I'm trying to ask you what is the action of feminism sure just just to be clear because I don't

(42:04) know why you're making all these like weird distinctions a lot of times what happens and the way that I think that how people create and this is honestly

(42:11) like platonic forms at this point is we like understand a concept of a thing so maybe the concept of the thing that you

(42:16) care about is women are being unfair to men and that's a concept just in your mind but what happens when you hold that

() 

(42:24) belief is that it shapes how you view the world it shapes what information that you take in to reinforce that and

(42:29) it shapes how you act we agree that concepts inform action but concepts are not actual things that do anything so

(42:37) that's why I'm asking you if feminism is just a concept sure what's this bridge

(42:42) between the concept and its application like for instance what does it look like for you to apply feminism in your ideal

(42:50) Okay so you just want policies anything yeah anything what does the family look like uh probably in North America by and

(42:57) large nuclear uh seems to be the best structure uh I would prefer more intergenerational than what we have i

(43:02) think intergenerational homes tend to be better um but I would also be open to like more commune style living village

(43:10) families so a a family a family unit are you saying a mother is it best for a

(43:15) mother a father uh by and large or at least two parents that like occupy those types of roles okay so basically a

(43:22) traditional looking reflective of a traditional Yeah family so that's good for society by and large yeah and you're

(43:28) saying from your view that's feminist uh I wouldn't say that that's feminist i would just say that that's like what's

(43:33) good for society okay but if not everything has to be feminism right okay so if that's good for society is that

(43:39) counterfeminism can I actually ask you a question just to see if you understand me how on my list of like top five ideas

(43:47) and things that I care most about where do you think feminism falls like do you think feminism is like number one just

(43:53) take a guess what do you three it's not even on my top five i think it's like not that important i'll debate with you

(43:59) on it because I'm interested in it feminism is not that important for society uh no because I think we it's done most of what it needed to do

(44:05) there's little elements left what did it do it just it convinced a bunch of chicks to kill their babies or to to

(44:11) delete their babies well some of it did that right a lot of it did that yeah abortion obviously which is like a

(44:17) tragedy but it also did things like let women have access to the workplace allow them to access education allow them to

(44:23) self-determine allow them to own land hold on women foriet even before to have

(44:29) the vote you have to let me finish my thoughts it says is a paddle hold on a second you can't call everything that I say i didn't say the I didn't say the

(44:35) word paddle once this whole time you literally just said I just said it yep you said every time i didn't do it every

(44:40) that Sorry you're right i'm having flashbacks from our last and Jay's debate sorry to interrupt you i just

(44:45) want to cuz I don't want to forget what you're saying is that it's actually not true that feminism produced working women women

(44:53) could work before largely what you think feminism is yes no this is a this is a

(44:58) major myth audience I want you to know this the feminist always comes in with this story that feminism saved the woman

() 

(45:06) from the home and then they're allowed to work that wasn't actually the case women could work it just happened to be

(45:12) the case that traditional values were the norm and rightly so that women valued in their society and in their

(45:18) home the position of the mother as one of the most important still today one of the most important uh uh roles to play

(45:26) for women in society they just held that belief they weren't chained not working

(45:31) they could work they just chose the value correctly to stay at home that the best thing for society and their family

(45:38) is to raise good children to be present with their children to uh organize the

(45:44) house to make the house a small type of organized government if you will and

(45:49) this is what happened feminism came in and smeared what motherhood is it smeared what the role in the family is

(45:56) it basically poisoned the well and said "That's icky you want liberation you

(46:02) want freedom." And guess what it resulted in more debt for women uh more

(46:08) sexually transmitted diseases for women higher body counts for women and ultimately the thing that they that what

(46:15) what do you think the biggest leverages for women what's your what is your biggest leverage point in society if if

(46:21) men's leverage is force brute force aggression what do you think women's

(46:26) leverage is uh probably sex sex can I go back to your narrative though can I one

(46:32) more i promise i promise I'll let you respond okay sex though largely I know you're you take a very

(46:38) particular unorthodox feminist view but largely if we're generally arguing against

(46:44) feminism has feminism perverted and sold women's leverage which is their sex and convince

(46:52) them to completely make it for free as as if that's liberation i would not fully uh the sexual revolution I think

(46:58) is like kind of [ __ ] but I I would not fully agree with that statement is it empowering for women to o uh to collect

() 

(47:05) body counts uh no uh can I go back to actually responding to your entire thing no i I don't think this idea of like

(47:11) collecting body counts is good the issue is that like most women don't think collecting body counts is good i think

(47:17) it's a very niche yes you deal with a lot of Only Fans models but that's obviously not the average woman you are

(47:22) dealing with a high selection bi so just to go back to like this narrativizing that you did so women work you said

(47:28) women didn't were able to work they just chose to be in the home well actually women always worked they just did farm

(47:34) labor and also domestic the main thing is that they never received any ability

(47:40) to convert that work into anything leverable within society like money or ownership why would they do why would

(47:46) they why would that happen because being able to have money and able to like liberate some level of autonomy is like

(47:52) one of the foundations to be able to make a choice for example if a woman is in an abusive relationship with a husband who is harming her and her

(47:58) children back in the 1910s when her farm labor would never translate to any goods and to anything that she can claim as

(48:05) her own she can never leave that situation stay there stay there in this in this situation let's say she was

(48:11) liberated and she was working do you know who's going to abuse the kids then the man is still abusing the kids no the

(48:16) people who are watching the kids because the mother's not home watching the kids so it's like you're like you're like you

(48:22) you you set up No you set up this hypothetical where if the woman could work then she can set up this like sort

(48:27) of like dowy escape dowy right but the thing but no hold on the thing is if the

(48:33) woman's out in the workforce she's not at home getting abused jim you have to engage with my points right you have to

(48:38) engage with what I'm saying that's literally what you said that's not what I said and if you keep erecting straw mans of me then we can't talk what did

(48:44) you say then what I said is that what happens when in the back in the 1910s era is that they were working women have

(48:51) always been working through all of history just as hard as men just doing more domestic uh agrarian style jobs the

(48:58) main thing just as hard as men a lot of times they're working all day taking care of the children and then also like

(49:04) milking the animals helping plow uh doing like just as hard as men yeah I would just say it's different work like

(49:10) men are in the mines but that doesn't mean Oh just as hard though uh it's more like uh physically destructive on the

(49:16) body um but like in in converse women just as risky i didn't say just as risky i'm just asking no it's not just as

(49:22) risky yeah um I don't know why you keep doing these well I'm talking about like well what's the risk and rewards but I'm

(49:28) asking you to just engage with me like just talk to me talk to me about my I understand i'm trying to summarize what

(49:34) you're saying you're saying back in the day women are working on the land and sweating and taking care of the kids and

(49:39) cooking and all these things but what's the problem with it wait yeah yeah well what is the problem with it well I said that do you not remember you said the

(49:45) problem is in the instance where they're beaten they they what what's the alternative i don't understand okay so

(49:52) the beaten was an example of why it's really important to have something like purchasing power it's really important to have some level of ownership of like

(49:58) goods so that you can like exchange and move and like autonomize within the world like the exchange of goods and

(50:04) basic economics is like one of the most fundamental things that bring like peace and freedom globally it's very very

(50:11) important to be able to own goods to be able to exchange those goods for other goods and to have some level of choice

(50:16) as a result of that women would work and be barred access to ownership of these

() 

(50:22) things that sounds like you're arguing for a norm based on an exception nope yeah you are if you're assuming that

(50:28) there's enough women in that scenario who are going to be in a situation that justifies that they have some sort of

(50:34) escape plan your entire uh foundational argument is this women should have

(50:40) purchasing power and be able to have money to do things in the event they have to leave their husband or their

(50:46) family whereas you're basically presenting one scenario that's and making a rule based on one potential

(50:53) scenario where a woman needs a an escape route well it's it's a decently common scenario that's one of the reasons why

(50:59) it's important for women to have rights another one if we connect it to the vote one of the reasons why it's so important to give the society the ability to vote

(51:07) is because it transfers your autonomy and authority to an elected to an

(51:12) elected individual and that individual makes choices ideally on your behest and as a woman you until you have the right

(51:20) to vote you don't have any ability to have a say in what policy societies have over historically of course you do

(51:28) unless you just don't believe in democracy i will tell you right now why you don't have a say oh can you let me I'll tell you why hold on jim you don't

(51:33) let me finish no you said a lot there one at a time no one one time jim you interrupted me as I Let's say 40 words

(51:39) per 40 words okay okay let's one cuz cuz then I'll forget what you said and then I won't be able to respond to you okay

() 

(51:46) so you just said do you want to You could just write down rather than Women need voting because they need to be able

(51:52) to influence policy and have a say in the society right that's one of the values of voting yeah okay so women have

(51:59) a say in the society but women aren't obligated to uphold and to def to defend

(52:05) the policies with force uh nobody is obligated to got it so nobody is

(52:11) obligated so you're arguing for women to be able to vote and from the from the

(52:17) allowance from the allowance of men men permit you to vote nope yes they do not

(52:22) really yes they do no small group of able but well first of all again you're going down the enforcement arm are you a

(52:28) police officer a military no so you are reliant on the same men they're men that

(52:34) doesn't matter they're not you don't get to steal the val you don't get to turn to women as a man who's not in any of

(52:39) these enforcement arguments how am I taking giving you the right how am I taking valor because what you're doing

(52:44) is you're looking at policemen and soldiers who are doing a duty to their nation by protecting Well no you said

(52:50) it's not a duty well once they sign you contradicted I'm not it's not a contradiction when Hold on do not

(52:56) interrupt me this time when men or women join the police force they take a whole bunch of promises and solidarities just

(53:02) like when a doctor joins the doctor force they have to take a whole bunch like the hypocratus hold on oath and so

(53:09) the idea of duty yes once you enroll in a job voluntarily and agree to both the

(53:14) responsibilities and the benefits and the power and the wage that is conferred by that now you have duties police

(53:20) officers have a duty to enforce the law what when you vote what's your duty

(53:26) to be an informed voter you're you're Okay cool so Hakua who's not an informed

(53:31) voter could vote cuz she's a woman right yep okay you just said she has a duty to be an informed voter yeah but that

(53:36) doesn't mean that like you would take away Hold on if you if is there any consequence to not fulfilling your duty

(53:42) in your worldview uh like not being an informed citizen yeah hakua votes yeah

(53:48) you get a situation where the politicians increasingly don't represent you and then you [ __ ] and whine about how bad the politicians are but they're

(53:54) bad because you're never actually voting for who you want okay would you agree that the act of

(54:00) voting for men collectively the act of voting is an agreement that they're not

(54:06) going to rebel no you don't you don't agree with that uh just for men well no

() 

(54:12) i'm saying men first i'm saying when a when a bunch of men vote and they say I'm going to vote they're basically

(54:19) they're they're signing something and and checking something off that might become policy and they're outsourcing

(54:26) the force in my case I'm not the force right when I vote I outsource the force right stolen valor right to police got

(54:33) it no police and the and the military and everyone else right sure when I outsource the force by voting I'm

(54:41) basically agreeing with other men in my position that we're not going to take up arms and rebel we're not going to start

(54:47) a civil war it's an agreement correct uh this is like not the way that is the

(54:53) basis for voting representation right if you don't have representation and your your your basically representatives

(55:00) don't represent you and and they get all wonky right that's why there's a militia that's why men can take up arms and

(55:06) actually have a revolutionary fight right this is historical right what the problem yes the problem hold on no the

(55:13) whole I get to respond now 40 for 40 right the issue that you're doing here is you're again you're creating this

(55:19) like simplified narrative to work to like your argument when things are not simple it is simple it is that simple

(55:25) the when you vote all you're saying is that I'm willing to participate to be a citizen whatever that looks like got you

(55:31) but participating as a citizen is an agreement to not rebel right uh I suppose more like to break the rules

(55:38) it's not about not No not just breaking the rules taking over the government with force with other men it's an

(55:44) agreement right sure great that's all I needed from you so when men collectively vote and they say "I'm forfeiting my my

(55:52) ability to get collectivized with other men." Hold on a second you're literally hold You can vote and then be

(55:59) dissatisfied with the government and Rebecca forfeiting it that's right why are you saying this no because you can

(56:04) do that at any time men can do that at any time look hold on a second hold on a second if I vote and I feel

(56:10) disenfranchised or lied to I could still do two things right i could either rebel

(56:15) or I could vote again the next time right mhm there's two choices every I'm saying every time

(56:22) you vote you're choosing not to do violence i'm not saying you can't do violence the next time around i'm saying in that instance you're choosing to vote

(56:28) instead of violence right uh again hold on hold on hold on let me

(56:34) run the argument for 40 line i I I can't because all you're doing is building this like really strong i am building a

(56:40) strong argument against you you're trying to stop it you're trying to block it well this is the issue right we get to like dialogue means we both get to

(56:46) talk the line of argument if I don't get to respond to anything and you just keep like prattling I'm you can I can leave

(56:54) and you can talk to stall go ahead do you want to talk to my chair or do you want to talk to me try to stall the line of argument okay the issue is that when

(57:01) you're simplifying this to like voting is just a agreement not to rebel is a massive reduction of what voting is

(57:07) doesn't make it not true it it what it actually does is it it bakes a halftruth into something to do what's the true

(57:13) part the true part is that to some degree you're conferring your authority as an individual to the to like the

(57:19) broader society but the issue is that it's not like every single time you're saying I'm not doing violence uh no

(57:25) every time you vote whether you know it or not you're making an agreement that you're not going to rebel and you're

(57:30) actually trusting that the government with its force and its processes and its legislative branch and and all of that

(57:37) is going to do its thing in favor of your vote when it doesn't you either vote again or you throw a fit and

(57:43) sometimes that starts a war right that's hap that happens in history the reason I'm asking you to accept this this

(57:49) premise is because if it's the case even from a reduced view that men when they

(57:55) vote forfeit their collective potential to overthrow the government or even try

() 

(58:02) i'm asking you what do women forfeit when they vote the same thing no they don't yes they do women can't overthrow

(58:08) a government of course they can no they can't tell me one time a w a collection of women overthrew a collection of men

(58:14) ever that that is not Hold on you're you're you're making a false dichotomy you're making a false dichotomy if

(58:20) you're going to engage in fall you're going to say make a claim and then I'm going to ask you to justify it's not a You're making a false dichotomy tell me

(58:25) one time collection of women overthrew a collection of men false dichotomy i can't engage what do you mean a false

(58:31) dichotomy you're b making it sound like I am saying that women are overthrowing men and that it's this zero sum game

(58:36) between the sexes when in reality when it comes to civil war especially with guns as the great equalizer civil war

(58:42) means a participation typically of men and women it's oftentimes women in support roles like a but they can also

(58:47) participate in the front lines do you need them as support roles or can you have men as support roles it's usually going to be better to have women in

(58:54) support yes you do this is why women are always used as nurses because men are better at the front line and so it's

(58:59) better to have the support roles filled by women cool so can a cool can a bunch of nurses overthrow the government uh

(59:06) yeah if they all collectivized sure theoretically of course they could of course a bunch of nurses can a bunch of

(59:11) nurses can collectivize and take over a bunch of military expert men you heard

(59:16) it here that's how delusional feminism is again false dichotomy this is not what it is can a collection of women Can

(59:22) a collection of people overthrow the government yes yes can a collection of

(59:27) pure women who are nurses overthrow a collection of men again are we doing a zero sum game where you're saying can

(59:33) you answer the question it's it's it's it's can 100 women who are nurses

(59:39) overthrow 100 men who are not nurses you're this is like a 100 men versus gorilla at this point no in in a bear in

(59:45) a bear fist fight to fist fight women are weaker than men this is [ __ ] jim Bob this isn't how the world works when

(59:52) it comes every major historical event is always a combination of effort from

(59:58) everyone it's not equal it I'm sorry the reality is that everyone is participating when it comes to civil war

(1:00:04) oh really is that why men are drafted yes no because of the man are women drafted what the [ __ ] are you talking

(1:00:10) about nobody is drafted anymore the draft still exists not really yes it does not really the draft still exists

(1:00:18) it's not war we basically overthrew the draft no you can absolutely just elect out of the draft at any time no you have

(1:00:23) to sign up you still have to sign up first of all and women don't so the fact of the matter is there's never a time in

(1:00:30) human history that you can point to where solely a collection of women took

(1:00:35) over a collection of men whereas hold of course I'm advocating Jim Bob i'm not

(1:00:40) holding on when all you're doing is making a straw man is there a time in history where a group of men collectively took over a group of men

(1:00:48) cool what's the What's the symmetry breaker between the two this is This is an on point what is the symmetry breaker

(1:00:54) you're acting like gender is this zero sum game and it's just not this isn't how history has worked ever yes it is

(1:00:59) all of history is based on force all of it all of it if you do you think that

(1:01:04) when the military men go off that women just have no role in any of their moral nobody things nobody said for 500 alex

(1:01:11) wow that's amazing okay no I didn't say that i'm asking you this is why I asked

(1:01:16) you if men collectively being that men can collectively take over other men because it's happened in the past and

(1:01:22) it'll happen in the future when we vote we forfeit we're basically agreeing

(1:01:27) we're not going to collectivize and take up our AR-15s and take the government or try to even right cause a ruckus if

(1:01:34) that's a trade-off when that men have I'm asking you what are women forfeiting

(1:01:39) you say the same thing no it's not the same thing because women can't collectively do the same thing so what

() 

(1:01:45) is your leverage the issue is again you're making this a zero- sum game

(1:01:50) where you're acting like men and women are these separate classes that are working independent they are unless

(1:01:55) you're a feminist like me they can't men and women are separate classes like demonstrated right now they're separate

(1:02:01) classes do you would you agree that this city we're in is largely dependent on

(1:02:07) the on men doing all of the service uh needs and all the brute uh strength work

(1:02:13) uh sewage plumbing fixing roads that what makes this society actually function would you would you largely

(1:02:19) agree that it's mostly men no no okay cool when if you want to say well hold

(1:02:25) on Jim Bob if you when you said do you think it's men that make society function and I would say of course not

(1:02:31) of course this is why this gender zero sum game is so toxic the reality yes is

(1:02:36) that another concept that has no basis in reality the same [ __ ] that feminists who are being gender opportunists are doing which is where they're trying to

(1:02:42) act like if men reality is toxic are doing good one if men are doing something and women are doing something

(1:02:48) it must be a zero sum game and they're just taking from each other when the reality of all of history this is what

(1:02:54) you were saying the reality of all of history is it is a collection of people working together fulfilling different

(1:03:00) roles to make society feminist Oliver that I debated kept saying "No you have to let No I won't i don't need to let

(1:03:06) you finish." Oliver said the same thing when I distinguish the class between men and women their ontology their nature

(1:03:11) and how they are different historically different what they do in society is different the roles they play in society

(1:03:17) are different the roles they play in war are different when I point this out Oliver and Kyla is that your name kyla

(1:03:24) do you want me to respond at this point i don't even know they said they they make it ambiguous what do they say

(1:03:29) people society no that's not actually how it works the leverage that men have right

(1:03:37) now right they could just take over towns if they wanted to women can't the

(1:03:42) leverage that men have right now it's not you if they didn't if they didn't show up to fix it's not Brian I said men

(1:03:50) this is what I'm calling stolen valor right this idea that young able-bodied

(1:03:56) men with a penchant for violence can do a thing like violently overtake a city

(1:04:01) can I join in you could but you're not going to all rights all of the values that you care about you're not going to

(1:04:08) be necessarily joining the civil war disabled men are suddenly just not

(1:04:13) pilot this is not a counter this is why Yes it is when you're treating men as a class how would you feel if you ate

(1:04:19) breakfast this morning all your what how would you feel if you didn't eat breakfast this morning oh

(1:04:25) god uh I'd be hungry okay cool so you're capable so the the the counterargument

(1:04:32) that Brian or myself won't or probably won't that's just you're just making [ __ ] up you're not I'm not You're not a

(1:04:38) police officer you're not in the military brian is not in the military brian's not a police officer talking about that yes you are because you're

(1:04:44) talking about violent pension men willing to do it and that's not you are you listening that's not you and you

(1:04:49) don't get to steal i'm not listening i moved it off of the violence and I moved it into the working sector okay um hold

(1:04:57) on underwater welding tunnel building uh road laying uh erecting massive

(1:05:05) buildings with air conditioning so Kyla can go you know go go number two in a nice uh environment this kind of stuff i

(1:05:13) the leverage for men is still actually right there present if they stopped working do you think a collection of

(1:05:18) women could take up all of those hard labor jobs and maintain society no i've never advocated for that so they So they

(1:05:24) have leverage can I respond at any leverage that women don't have well women have tons of leverage because they're the ones having your children

() 

(1:05:30) they're the They're not They're killing off their children because of feminism they are having your children you obviously need women to have children

(1:05:36) not feminists you obviously Jim do you need I need non feminist you got to you got to engage with me here do you need

(1:05:42) women to have children yes okay great so women are the ones raising your children they're having your children they're

(1:05:47) taking care of all of like the nursing they're taking care of the elderly they're doing the dominant amount of Christian feeding feeding the poor for

(1:05:54) free they're doing the dominant work are they feminists uh some of them no the ones having most of the children are

(1:06:00) feminist get out of here what that's what is the debate about feminism point Jim Bob is the debate about feminism

(1:06:07) you're now Now watch she conceded before that the best thing for the family is a traditional looking family right that's

(1:06:13) more reflective of a Christian view Christian practice not a feminist one that's anti-feminist when I asked her uh

(1:06:20) should feminism push against that traditional family value she moved over to another topic now when I ask her

(1:06:26) about the roles in upkeeping society right whether or not they're equal between men and women she conceds that

(1:06:31) they're not right but then she points to duties right i agree duties hold on

(1:06:36) duties of Yes oh so it's not Okay cool ing the sewer is not a duty it's not a duty okay no it's not a duty but it is a

(1:06:42) job that some people unfortunately elect in having a being a mom is not a duty it's a good thing to do how do you

(1:06:48) advocate for rights whether it's men or women and not advocate for the duty to defend those rights you don't I've never

(1:06:56) disentangled these two things what the what I want listen I want human rights i

() 

(1:07:03) want women women's rights but there's we have a duty let me respond to that do we have a duty to give people rights you

(1:07:09) got to let me respond do we have a duty to give women rights um you from your view you personally don't no does anyone

(1:07:15) have a duty to grant you rights uh what do you mean by that rights are a set of

(1:07:22) behaviors that are permitted no yes they are rights are not behaviors that are permitted they're behavior no they're

(1:07:28) prerequisite behavior that we think that everyone should have access to rights are they're permitted

(1:07:34) can you use force to not permit a behavior uh yes give me one right that the government couldn't actually uh

(1:07:41) prohibit uh faith faith you have a right to believe in something in your head you

(1:07:47) have a right yeah you have a right freedom of of religion the government no matter what can't take your ability to believe in God to think yeah to think

(1:07:53) great that's one thing that you call a right i would say that's more of a duty or an internal working what does duty

(1:07:59) mean to you then like an obligation well this is the thing you're you're unironically equivocating because duty

(1:08:05) started as like specific things that you must do is believe in God a woman's right

(1:08:11) it's religion it has nothing to do is look look I'm you're coming to the table specifically with feminism so you're

(1:08:17) pointing to rights specific to females that maybe men have and and women don't so when I'm asking you the question

(1:08:24) should women let's say voting is that right is voting a right uh yes okay can

(1:08:29) men take away your vote to your vote uh yes okay so they can take away your right but again it's not men it's the

(1:08:35) enforcement arm can the enforcement arm Well this is an important distinction unbelievable no this is this is a

(1:08:41) fundamental distinction because every single time you say can the enforcement arm be made up of rabbits every single time can the enforcement arm be made up

(1:08:47) of rabbits do you think so say for example you've got a society and the entire enforcement arm is made up of a

(1:08:53) slave cast maybe it's it's a society where it's all black people does that mean black people run the society

(1:09:00) why Why can only black people be slaves this is a weird world in Narnia where only black people weird it's not weird

(1:09:08) it's not weird Jim Bob to reference black people being slaves that's like one of the most standard historical things that doesn't mean it's good nice

(1:09:15) try though well if they serve as the enforcement arm it might be good okay so if if say we have a world and white

(1:09:20) people have all of the control they're in the governance but the entire enforcement arm is a slave cast of black

(1:09:26) people would you say then that black people run society in that society uh I would say black people have a chance and

(1:09:32) they actually demonstrate that's not what I asked you do black people run the society uh not currently but they could

(1:09:37) actually fight it so in this world do black people run society uh no but they could fight and actually run it but

(1:09:43) couldn't the white people just fight and yeah that's white and black we're talking about men and women duh okay so

(1:09:48) you realize talking about men versus men you prove my point if you swap out the blacks and they're and they're women

(1:09:53) slaves guess what can the women actually change the nature of the world no but the group of black men couldn't yeah

(1:10:00) they Oh you're going to fight a bunch of men no they get to sexually select who they're going to be with they get to progress that's not true women don't get

(1:10:07) to No not in a slave situation what are you talking about we're not talking about a slave situation you just brought

(1:10:13) up a slave situation and then you moved on beyond that to go back to the Yes because we were talking about blacks and

(1:10:18) whites and then you moved on to men at a broader category i kept the slave situation replace the black slaves with

(1:10:25) women right in your example you said "Who's who's running the show?" Well the

(1:10:32) one who has the most force that's who's running the show hold on a second black people hold on a second in a scenario

(1:10:38) where there's an oppressor a strong arm and a a group of men who are the weak arm the winner is the one with the most

(1:10:46) force correct mhm so the black people right in this in this scenario or the best tactics can take over with Well

(1:10:53) actually that's a really good point right when you look at for example wars it's not always just the one that has the best force that wins israel and the

(1:11:00) uh six- day war is a really good example of a country that was positioned against all of the Arab nations they technically

(1:11:06) had less force but they had superior mind and so they won right right so this idea that it's just blunt force that

(1:11:12) wins out in these things is the most that is what you are saying you just said Jim Bob pause you just said between

(1:11:19) these two arms whichever one has more force wins the answer is entirely true

(1:11:25) it's actually who's most Can I fix this for you if there's two groups of of uh

(1:11:31) two military groups and they're both equally smart if the one who's smart

(1:11:38) just as smart as the other has superior force who's going to likely win yeah sure in the case where like tactics are

(1:11:43) identical so force is the actual decider no because in You just agreed you just agreed give me an actual real life

(1:11:49) example where force is perfectly equated what do you mean perfectly equated you're you're saying if if tactics was

() 

(1:11:55) perfectly equated then force wins give me a situation

(1:12:00) power is never perfectly equated in boxing you just said "Give me a potential example where it's equated and

(1:12:06) then the the the more powerful one wins over the tactics." No typically in boxing it's often times like like most

(1:12:12) of the greatest boxers a lot of times are people who are incredibly talented and tactical right like Mike Tyson

(1:12:18) wasn't just good cuz he punched really hard he was also really good because he had the weave he had good footwork and

(1:12:23) he also could win it without the power uh yeah I think like Floyd Mayweather is a good example of somebody who doesn't

(1:12:28) have a super strong punch he'sing Hold on you didn't let me finish floyd Mayweather is a great example of

(1:12:34) somebody who doesn't have a high level of force they're not the strongest guy out there but they have incredible footwork and they're insanely fast and

(1:12:40) so he still wins all of his fights one thing really quick here guys we got to take a brief break for for little chats

(1:12:47) to come through if you want your chat to be read we're doing Streamlabs streamlabs.com/wever we're going to do

(1:12:54) $99 and up for those we have uh Intel Wild here thank you Intel appreciate it intel wild donating your friend w Jim

(1:13:02) Bob dos in the chat and not so bright stop showing us your armpits gross okay

(1:13:10) this guy do you know the armpit meme about me no no so I have a neck injury so when I was streaming I would often go

(1:13:15) like this cuz it relieves like pressure in my neck which means Intel Wild probably watches me because it's like a

() 

(1:13:22) niche it's a niche meme about me wow there you go he's There you go we we discovered it and you made like 300

(1:13:28) bucks from him tonight so something like that he's a he's a Kyla enjoyer okay we have Chef Dill Pickles thank you man

(1:13:36) chef Dill Pickles donated $100 erodite you said that women should

(1:13:41) have barriers removed to allow them to choose what they want tell me do you

(1:13:46) think we should have listened when the majority of women said they didn't want suffrage

(1:13:51) you want to respond to that one uh yeah probably then we shouldn't have been like forcing women to have the vote they

(1:13:56) should have won it through like persuasion i I think the suffragettes were kind of shitty i just think that that we inevitably we would have

(1:14:02) resulted in a situation where women have the vote all right and then we have Giovani he's back also giovani thank you

(1:14:09) man appreciate it giovani Jade you donated $100 can Christianity knock over a cup

(1:14:16) no then Christianity can't build a society two gay sophists in a row that's

(1:14:22) woman sucks and you dodge the substance of the convo this hard gay and cringe wow okay giovani is a hater he's he's an

(1:14:30) equal opportunity yeah that's that that's actually false christianity actually has applied duties the the the

(1:14:36) worldview of Christianity dumbass is actually expressed in matter in fact

(1:14:41) without the matter uh binding it to the philosophy and the worldview and the practice it doesn't exist but that's why

(1:14:48) I'm pointing Giovani you [ __ ] is that feminism doesn't actually have a

(1:14:54) practice that's correct and Christianity does correct but that doesn't mean that it doesn't have practice it doesn't have

(1:15:00) anything of course it does it led to women having the vote you You mean You mean patriarchy platonic floor your

(1:15:07) pract Your practice is patriarchy shadows on a wall your practice is literally patriarchy okay feminist

(1:15:13) practice is patriarchy the shadows on the wall i won't look at them they're not real oh okay it's a

(1:15:20) platonic joke okay oh got it okay we got Brian S here thank you for the big $200 soup chat women were always able to vote

(1:18:30) now i would lose oh okay yeah i'm not like the type of woman who's like testosterone is not real i realize it's

(1:18:37) real all right sorry go ahead um I wanted to point to this i think it's an

(1:18:43) issue with with your worldview is that I know that your worldview isn't solely feminist right but if you're arguing for

(1:18:50) a feminist view do you agree that you would need to borrow from another view to apply feminism at least like uh from

(1:18:57) an ethical position i know Jay pressed you on your ethics and your epistemology i I'm not going to go into that but the

(1:19:03) reason I'm asking is if you held a view that says feminism is good and this is

(1:19:09) how I'm measuring it and you think uh women should have rights let's say I'm

(1:19:14) not sure how you could make the argument that we ought to give women rights if you don't simultaneously argue that men

() 

(1:19:22) ought to give them to you uh because again it's it's conflating men with the

(1:19:27) enforcement arm well if men collectively whatever you want to call the enforcement arm right the enforcement

(1:19:33) arm yeah so it's just what is an abstract collection of men mostly predominantly men but there are women in

(1:19:39) it too and the mo the most important thing is that the enforcement arm is given legitimacy from the ruling class i

(1:19:45) understand okay so which can be men and women so do you agree that there's an enforcement arm let's say the enforcement arm in this scenario is 96%

(1:19:53) men and 4% women i would I just wouldn't The issue is that the enforcement arm

(1:19:58) doesn't get to do wanton violence because it's a bunch of men that can do violence no then they would be a rebel

(1:20:04) group and they would be They could be a rebel group yeah but that's not what either of us are that's called a rebellion yeah but nobody neither of us

(1:20:11) are talking about rebel groups right now we're talking about one because what legitimizes are because if if that

(1:20:17) enforcement arm that's mostly men decided you don't get the vote what leverage do you have please pretty

(1:20:24) please that's it that the enforcement arm doesn't ever get to decide that in our societ it doesn't who gets is the is

(1:20:31) the government if they don't if they if the government decides X and the enforcement arm says we're not enforcing

(1:20:37) that is there any decision on X so do you think that Trump is answer i'm answering your question with a question

(1:20:43) it's not stupid have you never engaged with Socratic method no that's not how it works it is the Socratic method is

(1:20:49) asking each other questions in exchange question unless you want to just be like why do I have to answer your question if

(1:20:54) you don't answer mine I've answered all of your questions if someone passes a law the ruling class passes a law over

(1:21:01) here trump if they pass a law and the enforcement arm doesn't enforce it is

(1:21:06) there any power in in this uh no no but the enforcement arm it's not the

(1:21:12) enforcement arm unless you're going to tell me that police officers have more power in this country than Trump which

(1:21:17) would be crazy it's not just police officers okay of course it's not just police officers then why would you say

(1:21:22) police officers okay sorry I should have also added soldiers military Navy Seals everything else i'm obviously meaning

(1:21:28) the entire enforcement arm which is decide to not go to work does Does the policy or law have any power do you

(1:21:34) think the enforcement arm is weaker than Trump what do you mean Trump as an individual yeah our president yeah the

(1:21:40) enforcement arm could take over Trump if if they wanted to interesting so the enforcement arm is actually the one in control of our our country not Trump

(1:21:46) when it comes down to it if the enforcement arm decides we're not doing this right we're changing our minds

(1:21:52) we're dropped you know like for instance the same principle holds when someone does a like like they uh a boycott or

(1:21:58) they they don't come to work right a protest mhm that has power right leverage it's like a soft power yeah

(1:22:04) yeah yeah but if the if the if the job they're doing is actually enforcement for instance if police stop showing up

(1:22:11) police have the power to stop showing up hold on dude do police have the power and the will to stop showing up to to uh

(1:22:19) crime scenes yeah but then all of their livelihood would be taken away i understand but if they risk that for

(1:22:24) something good right if they thought well that's a risk but if it was an

(1:22:30) ethical view right they could actually do that and that's leverage right uh the the issue is that in reality the reason

(1:22:36) why Trump is more powerful because I'm sure you actually agree with this than the enforcement arm is because he has

(1:22:42) for example the ability that if the enforcement arm decided to rebel against him he could immediately cut off all

(1:22:47) funding to any enforcement arm and immediately strip them of the ability to have arms he could lock up facilities

(1:22:53) that they wouldn't otherwise have wait hold on hold on listen to what you're saying lock up facilities and take their

(1:22:58) arms right with what wait dot dot dot drum roll with what what do you think banking is do you think banking is the

(1:23:04) enforcement arm you want to focus on the one that works for you but you don't want to engage with the debating do you

(1:23:09) think banking arm it's not dodging look you just ran into he would have to lock it up with his private secretary instead

(1:23:17) all force okay so if you said uh a bunch of people rebelled against Trump the the

(1:23:22) enforcement arm he can do XYZ and everything you listed would assume that he also has this other set of people

(1:23:29) that are forced banking would not insist that he could he could cut off all of their money immediately yeah you can cut

(1:23:35) off ground all their flame yeah you can you can physically uh uh thwart uh you

(1:23:40) know the internet and banking and electronics and all that stuff ability to do that yeah but the thing is that's

(1:23:47) not force right yeah but look I the do you think my argument is that you can't

(1:23:52) do different kinds of warfare no what I'm saying is that even if he did that what's going to ultimately decide

(1:23:59) things in over time is going to be a body of over time especially is going to be money i'm sorry money oh really so

(1:24:07) where money is meaningless what what where have you ever been to have you ever seen a situation where money is

(1:24:13) literally on the ground everywhere that's called inflation that's not related to the situation so when when so

(1:24:19) money you think money is the determining factor i think money is probably one of

(1:24:24) the most important like systems of leveraging power on the planet yes I understand but if it comes down to money

(1:24:30) or or pure military force let's say a country is really rich but they don't have a military and there's another

(1:24:37) country that's that hold on i'm not presenting these things as mutually exclusive right well I'm pointing to the

(1:24:42) deciding factor that you keep trying to avoid every scenario you give ultimately the deciding factor is muscle i'm not

(1:24:49) really understanding so like I've already granted you that muscle is really important the enforcement arm is very important the issue is that I'm

(1:24:55) trying to say it's a more complicated story than you want people to believe because it doesn't work to your narrative which is that for example

(1:25:01) banking is obviously one of the most powerful things in the world is it more powerful than force in an acute sense no

(1:25:06) of course not but I'm well in a long term for example which a war is long term you can't feed people you can't do

(1:25:13) any logistics you can't do any coordinating do you need an enforcement arm in the threat of force to have a bank yeah but these things are Hold on

(1:25:22) like Jim Bob none of these are winning to your thing you're trying to act like force is like the number one it's the

(1:25:27) most important thing it is the deciding factor no it's not when what's another deciding factor if it's not force

(1:25:32) tactics what tactics of what of of warfare warfare is force yeah but it's

(1:25:39) it's not just force force is violence right force is like going pew pew look look look you can't say force is now

(1:25:46) just all of these other things so that you can like make your argument work if two bodies of force have equal tactical

(1:25:54) skills and knowledge and one has superior force who's going to win between the ones who

(1:26:01) are equal in tactical knowledge i already answered that can I add on to that well no what's the answer for the whole audience i already said the one

(1:26:06) with superior force here's the next question say one they're equal in those ways one has to higher force but the

(1:26:12) other one has four times the amount of money which one wins now the force not necessarily what do you mean how How

(1:26:18) does money beat a gun because you can hire other additional Isn't it weird ladies and gentlemen when I get robbed

(1:26:24) on the street I can't throw my money at the person to defend i'm not saying I'm not saying that money is

(1:26:30) force i'm saying that when you're pretending like this idea of force in the enforcement arm is so simple it's just like muscle makes right like

(1:26:36) unironic i didn't say right i said it makes you saying No you're doing master morality don't lie you're doing master

(1:26:42) morality yes you are no I'm not stop lying what is master morality i don't know but it's not might is right so

(1:26:47) you're saying that you're not doing a might is right i never heard the term but if you're saying might is right

(1:26:53) that's not a gotcha i'm saying might is this is why it's an important question

(1:26:58) if you agree with me that might is it's not right it just is it could be the case it's right it could be wrong right

(1:27:05) if that's a case that we both agree that might just is that's descriptive doesn't exist it's no it no it's descriptively

(1:27:12) the case that force wins that's that doesn't say it's right it wins

(1:27:17) yes uh yeah in like a one to one again stop no the world is notable i know it I

(1:27:23) know it would be Hold on every time I get one premise out you you you basically take us to Wall-E world like

(1:27:29) look just follow follow i have been following the issue Jim B that means stop that means be quiet for

(1:27:35) a second i don't have to I don't have I don't have to if we agree that force wins no one said it's right if we agree

(1:27:42) that force wins isn't the next logical question is what philosophy or worldview

(1:27:48) informs the use of force if pure force wins is descriptively true

() 

(1:27:56) concentrate it's not that's what I'm telling you oh it's not now no because you're now moving to a philosophical

(1:28:02) system of how you set up for example maybe nation states we can maybe use force in the state of nation states the

(1:28:08) moment that you go to that this idea that just force wins is devoid of any of the complications of reality right the

(1:28:15) reality is that if you have a super strong force but you don't have logistics you don't have means to feed them you don't have caretakers for them

(1:28:21) to take care of the wounded you don't have a GDP to be able to fund them and make them strong and uh have like more

(1:28:27) disagreeing with that you you are fundamentally eroding these things so that you can just say force really

(1:28:33) matters but I've never said that force doesn't matter i'm saying you're painting a really simple other things

(1:28:39) when this is complicated i never said those you want to make it complicated so you don't have to deal with the entailments but no I want to make it

(1:28:44) complicated cuz I would love for a discussion to slightly map on to reality just slightly all right cool so if you

(1:28:50) have two groups of uh uh two different armies right fighting out there in the field do you think it's uh better for

(1:28:57) one or the other to um to be able to deal with the harshness of the elements in long periods of time

(1:29:05) uh is it better to be able to to be in like the heat for a long period of time to be carrying a lot of weight for a

(1:29:10) long period of time yeah of course this is why men are better at the front line gotcha okay so if that's the case it still comes down to brute force

(1:29:16) collectively even in the incense where you have to Yes it does you have to carry food right so for example if brute

(1:29:23) force was sufficient Germany would have a much better time taking over Russia because they were [ __ ] dumpstering

(1:29:29) they had way more force on their hand the problem is that they had a failed logistics system and that they couldn't they had no way of managing the winter

(1:29:36) particularly because their their uh tanks got stuck in the mud this is why logistics and things like nurses all of

(1:29:42) these things matter they try to reduce the world to force all you're doing is just pretending no

(1:29:48) even in that instance did they lose to concepts or did they also lo did they lose to another body of force what did

(1:29:56) they lose to another body of force they mostly lost to technology failures and

(1:30:01) winter is that does that uh technological failures does that require uh no men no okay to avoid developing a

(1:30:10) tank does not require men oh really it requires science listen guys developing a tank doesn't require men it requires

(1:30:19) science science is a method what's the scientific method the scientific method is the process by which you use No

(1:30:24) what's the method what steps yeah I'm going to walk you through what's the first step do Okay I can walk you

(1:30:30) through it what's the step the first step is going to be hypothesis no that's an observation wrong no yes it is how do

(1:30:37) you do a hypothesis on something you don't observe dummy uh okay you're talking about basic science yeah you

(1:30:43) can't even tell me what the scientific method is science built tanks no engineering built tanks and men had

(1:30:49) engineering tanks made of uh various things there's like steel bodies are

(1:30:55) they again have you ever seen Do you think you could do you think you could hammer

(1:31:01) in one of the the bolts of the Let's just go back let's just This is hilarious let's just breathe and go back

(1:31:06) you guys engineers men don't build tanks science does do what are you Neil Degr

(1:31:11) Tyson what's wrong with you do you think that we would have tanks without science nobody said that men build tanks and use

(1:31:19) heard a guy's science builds tanks because you were saying concepts don't of course men build tanks women don't

(1:31:27) build tanks women just can build tanks oh can they yes really yes we have the

(1:31:32) science and technology for it oh you have the brute force to carry all of those heavy pieces of equipment typically you're going to have like a

(1:31:37) carrying equipment yeah you can use like forklifts and all the other [ __ ] that they use do you think that like men by themselves are just like brute carrying

(1:31:44) still yes they are no they're using factories and robotics what are you talking about they're not pure by the

() 

(1:31:50) way who manages and builds robotics men and women no mostly men engineering

(1:31:56) metal smithing machining all of these things large scale it's disproportionately like occupied by men

(1:32:02) but this is this is more of the feminist argument at this point it's not it is because like by and large uh women were

(1:32:08) barred from education and that like these disciplines didn't reinforce look look your own army let's say you have your own army right and I just can't

(1:32:14) believe you said that science doesn't build tanks that's the most wise engineering builds tanks science

(1:32:19) engineering is science my friend science is science is natural dude no it's yes it is it's study of the natural world

(1:32:26) tanks aren't natural dummy do you I'm sorry do you think that science didn't contribute to the development of tanks

(1:32:32) no I didn't say that i said science itself the natural well science it dummy sc can you engineer without science no

(1:32:39) yes you can no yes you can not very well I didn't say well if you can engineer

(1:32:45) without science then it it demonstrates that you can do engineering without science the argument isn't the argument

(1:32:50) isn't whether or not science contributes the question isn't I never

(1:32:55) said science doesn't contribute to engineering I'm saying science itself as

(1:33:01) a methodology which you don't even [ __ ] know The method doesn't you haven't even let me speak you didn't even start with an observation because a

(1:33:07) lot of science doesn't start with observation for example basic science just hypothesizes free willy and then it

(1:33:13) tests it like what uh basic science for example would be one person was like just pretty sure that our gut biome uh

(1:33:19) the ulcers that they did that without obser knowing and observing what a gut biome is they just imagine a gut biome

(1:33:25) without observing and knowing what it is no the main actually thing is that they hadn't been able to observe the bacteria

(1:33:30) in there and but they proposed any ways that it was a bacteria in fact it was viewed as a very very conscious so they knew what bacteria was

(1:33:37) bro did they know what bacteria was yes cool so they observed bacteria before so they they started with an observation to

(1:33:44) know what bacteria is they know what a gut is that's an observation you can't posit hypothesis without You can't do it

(1:33:51) without an observation i'm sorry you out of the depth do you know what the difference no I'm not you don't even know the scientific do you know what the

(1:33:56) difference is between basic and applied science yes what's the difference well applied science is basically that's what

() 

(1:34:02) engineering is it's taking the conclusions the regularity the inductive reasoning from the scientific method and

(1:34:08) applying it into making [ __ ] what's basic science basic science is natural science what is that you observe natural

(1:34:15) phenomena in the world you have a hypothesis of what's causing the natural phenomenon you introduce an independent

(1:34:21) variable you remove it you'd repeat repeat repeat and then you come up with a hypo a conclusion which is what

(1:34:27) produces a scientific theory okay so you don't understand this so basic basic tell me one thing I said was wrong dummy

(1:34:32) i will just breathe don't do this [ __ ] passive aggressive [ __ ] where you don't understand this tell me what I

(1:34:37) got wrong me all the time tell me what I got wrong do I will but you stop gaslighting me you have to stop you're a

(1:34:43) professional gaslighter brian I Brian daddy help me patriarchy help me i win i

(1:34:49) do do you want me to get your question i will answer if you breathe if we can let's try to avoid the uh ad homs and

(1:34:56) the insults okay go ahead so basic science is typically where a hypothesis

(1:35:02) can be generated with without observation it's something that essentially a scientist theorizes and

(1:35:07) then they create a hypothesis to test it and then they test it applied science is using observations from nature or from

(1:35:13) the world around you and building off of these observations to create a more like targeted hypothesis of what we expect it

(1:35:19) to become and then testing that out most science that you're familiar with is part of this applied science branch

(1:35:25) because basic science is like more like what 1800's philosophers got to do where

(1:35:30) they just like whimsically were like I wonder if I lick metal if it'll cure cancer and then they tried it right

(1:35:36) that's what basic science was where you just like try like hocus pocus [ __ ] to see if it works whereas applied science

(1:35:41) is going like well whenever I drop this ball I notice if it hits this and so I'm going to test and see if I drop different things of different weight if

(1:35:46) it changes the velocity of dropping and which one of those built a tank uh I have no idea the history of science but

(1:35:53) I'm assuming I which part uh gunpowder I

(1:35:58) suspect probably wasn't science at all the Chinese did it i have a feeling that they kind of noticed these things like

(1:36:04) igniting one another maybe it was applied science but for example a lot of medical advancements come from basic

(1:36:10) science yeah do you think you could load a cannonball into a Me personally yeah i don't know

(1:36:16) how to work tanks no I mean just a cannonball into a cannon oh uh yeah probably you could load one in yeah I

(1:36:22) think they're about like 5 lbs can you pull back uh the rail of a clock uh like the inside gear mechanis [ __ ] a

(1:36:30) gun can you do that okay can you break down a gun uh no clean it okay i don't That's not a dunk

(1:36:38) i've I've never Well no it it kind of is a dunk because a part of managing weaponry even not just a tank but even

(1:36:45) small weapons you have to be able to clean it effectively and you have to have to be able to you have to be able

(1:36:51) to use brute strength and be able to hold it firm and so I've never that

(1:36:56) having some like I've never denied that frontline soldiers are better served typically by men or by women who can

() 

(1:37:01) achieve the same like physical standards that erected for men what I've what I've actually done is said that science is

(1:37:07) the concept by which tanks emerged and then labor was used to build these things but to act like it's men is again

(1:37:14) it's just this reductive narrative of diminishing like how again you just get to steal valor because like men were in

(1:37:20) these roles that there's a really complicated question of like why were men in these roles and maybe not women and also there's a why is every answer

(1:37:26) to your philosophy it's complicated because the world is incredibly [ __ ] complicated so do you understand it or

(1:37:32) it's complicated but you understand it I understand elements of it but it seems like I understand maybe more than you well no it sounds like what you're

(1:37:39) saying basically every time I have you cornered you say it's very complicated which is a very common tactic with

(1:37:46) nonsense machines I don't just say it's complicated I say it's complicated and then I go on to list out the like squellle and multiffactorial elements

(1:37:53) that make it complicated nobody in this nobody in their right mind would look at the world look at like taxes or debt or

(1:38:01) banking or central banking nobody should look at these things and be like "Yeah it's really [ __ ] simple." No it's not

(1:38:07) well in this central banking very complicated tanks very

(1:38:13) simplicity the thing that's being reduced is not complicated it seems to be only complicating for for you

(1:38:19) honestly is that the descriptive element of this debate that's true that holds true that you even agree with is that

(1:38:25) it's primarily men who are applying force to maintain a society whether it's law or the world itself or erecting

(1:38:32) buildings and maintaining all this [ __ ] yeah i mean I've just agreed with that the issue is that like we then got into which we you didn't really allow me to

(1:38:38) which is like who gives the legitimacy to those like young able-bodied men to enact violence in a legitimate way a

(1:38:44) group of people who have superior force no yes no government what that's that's

(1:38:50) what a government is it's superior force trump is just stronger than No the body of the government which has an arm the

(1:38:57) branch of force is the government it's all inclusive it's all one big thing

(1:39:02) right the military is not part of the government no not necessarily the government rules over the military the

(1:39:08) military is not an arm of the government when when when the president has is the leader of what the the Yeah he's the

(1:39:15) leader of it it's underneath him it is it a part of his governance

(1:39:20) yes but that doesn't mean that it is the government right the military is not the government the military is not part of

(1:39:26) the government i That's not what I said i said that it isn't the government right the one that confers the authority

(1:39:31) to the violent pension is this hand a part of my body yep is it my body uh no

(1:39:37) it's your hand and it's part of your body okay so so it's not my body well it is your body and it's your hand right

(1:39:43) there's like a level of specificity that you can apply to cool so so this isn't my body it is your body it's just also

(1:39:51) your hand so if this if I'm the government and this that's analogous to the government yeah if I'm the

(1:39:56) government and this is the enforcement arm of the military is this the government by the same logic uh I'm sure

(1:40:04) why are you Why are you wincing i'm I'm wincing because again it I makes me wonder if you understand your branch

(1:40:10) what is wrong with your brain does your Do you understand i use your logic what are the three branches of the government legislative uh [ __ ] Sorry finish it

(1:40:18) for me executive executive judicial judicial gotcha yeah none of those are military if you might notice the

(1:40:24) executive branch needs the military well it's under the executive branch yeah it's part of the It's What are you talking i'm saying if you can't execute

(1:40:31) a policy there's no executive branch yes so the military is under the president right

(1:40:39) yeah the president's what the what the leader of the country yeah the

(1:40:44) military's under him right he gives the military the authority to do the violence he legitimizes it that's what

(1:40:50) I'm saying that's cool that's in my in favor of my argument u you know what that that that body can determine right

(1:40:59) even if you think it's unjust it can actually determine and take control it could literally tomorrow could take your

(1:41:06) rights to vote right i don't know why you're talking about the government when you don't even know the three branches look I know you're going to hold on to

(1:41:11) that forever but this it that's pales like like what you've said tonight do you know what the legislative role is it

(1:41:18) doesn't matter it kind of does it doesn't matter no cuz the argument is feminism this is No this is the same thing well we've obviously moved pretty

(1:41:24) far away from it this is the same thing when we debated last time and we were talking about G what good is the legislative body that passes you're

(1:41:30) fighting me about concepts you don't even know i'm not talking about the function of the government just to be

(1:41:36) clear it's fine if you don't know these things the problem is when you weaponize your like

(1:41:42) ignorance all you have is gaslighting please let me finish all you do is gaslight and gaslight and gaslight

(1:41:47) that's all you do i don't know why you're That's literally your career you're like a Tumblr girl right now what good is like cutting your being sad too

(1:41:54) kyla focus what good is legislating policy if you can't execute it with

() 

(1:42:00) force uh it's no good i I'm This is not the argument is the legislative part of

(1:42:05) the uh is that a part of the the government the legislature yes okay cool so if the legislative branch is a part

(1:42:12) of the government that uh informs policy and makes policy and passes policy or whatever if it's no good without force

(1:42:19) right mhm if passing policy that gives you entitlements like voting or anything else you call liberty under under under

(1:42:26) feminism if the if it's the case that the body of force could literally not enforce it at all okay you're at the

(1:42:34) mercy just like me of a body of predominantly men therefore rights as you argue them

(1:42:40) this is this all branched from this very simple argument is that you made an argument that women should have

(1:42:47) rights i gave you the entailment of that if you say women ought to have rights

(1:42:54) which is a normative claim about what should happen right you're

(1:42:59) simultaneously saying given that there's a legislative branch branch that writes

(1:43:04) that out and does it you're simultaneously saying that people in the

(1:43:10) legislative branch in the enforcement arm ought to defend and uphold that policy

(1:43:17) right uh sure i guess here's my So now there's an obligation for men primarily

(1:43:22) and from your feminist view you cannot produce an obligation feminism has zero

(1:43:28) obligations okay again obligations men are not obligated to be police or or soldiers soldiers and police are

(1:43:36) obligated to be police and soldiers because that's what they agree to right so this this obligation again feminism

(1:43:42) it doesn't obligate anything but feminism isn't a doctrine of political governance right it doesn't have to

(1:43:47) obligate things in the way that like a government system does for example the government obligates you as a citizen to

(1:43:53) listen to the rules of the country right it's important and I know you're going to be like "How do you enforce those rules?" It's force but after that after

(1:44:00) we've gotten into that it's really important for you to understand that when you're talking about feminism it's

(1:44:06) not a political philosophical structure and so when you're asking what the obligations are underneath it it's not

(1:44:12) proport you're you're basically measuring like a truck uh when we're talking about rainbows you be like "Why

(1:44:17) doesn't this rainbow work like the truck does?" How do you make How do you put that many words out and say nothing jim

(1:44:24) Bob I'm sorry if you didn't understand that that might explain why you don't know the three branches of the government just to be clear I was pretty

(1:44:32) simple in what I just said there okay cool so the question is you don't understand what I said just to give it back you agree that under your feminist

(1:44:39) view that you're you're arguing is better or good for society that there actually are no obligations it's not a

(1:44:45) governmental system what that's what makes of course it's a governmental system feminism is not a government the

(1:44:50) moment you say women should have x rights it becomes a governmental system

(1:44:55) it's part of a You're appealing to the government no that mean appealing to the government is not the same thing as

(1:45:01) being a government system it is obvious that feminism is not equable in any way to like a democracy or monarchy which is

(1:45:08) how like power gets i I understand that well the issue is that you're pointing at feminism and being like "Look at it

(1:45:14) it has no obligations." And it's like you're comparing that but you're comparing that to government system but

(1:45:20) world most worldviews don't have obligations necessary to them so what's better for a society a society that has

(1:45:27) obligations or none none a society that has obligations is obviously better because that's how you make nation

(1:45:32) states that's how you make society got you so does feminism have obligations uh again it depends on what you mean by

(1:45:39) obligations does your view of feminism values or no any obligation that means you're compelled to act a certain way

(1:45:47) you're compelled to do certain duties in the world you're compelled to act no feminism does not have obligations with

(1:45:53) not a government system i got you premise one a a worldview that has

(1:45:59) obligations and duties is better than one that doesn't prem Hold on let me finish premise two trucks are way better

() 

(1:46:05) than rainbows oh god you She doesn't want this to hit these are These are just analogous stop interrupting well

(1:46:10) you're doing a fallacy stop what's the fallacy the fallacy is that you're being disanalogous what that's not What are

(1:46:16) you talking about what's this analogous that that you're comparing feminism to a governmental system it's not a

(1:46:21) governmental system i didn't say government you did because you said it doesn't have a way of enforcing obligations but the only thing that can

(1:46:28) enforce obligations is a level i didn't enforce obligations with government i

(1:46:34) didn't say that that didn't come out of my mouth okay okay premise one don't interrupt me premise

(1:46:40) one a society that has a worldview with obligations and duties is better than

(1:46:46) one without right feminism doesn't have obligations and duties in its

(1:46:51) worldview conclusion any worldview that has obligations and duties is better

(1:46:57) than feminism okay

(1:47:03) uh would you like to respond to that yeah it's just it's it's it's no premises don't don't meta Yelp review

(1:47:09) just get to the premises uh uh sure society with obligations is better than a side society without yeah I'm not

(1:47:15) pro-anarchy feminism does not have obligations in the case of like statehood yeah it doesn't it's not purporting to be a governmental system

(1:47:21) this is again just a false analogy well no it's not an analogy it's literally a premise views that you and I both would

(1:47:28) agree might be good things that don't have necessary obligations that you are compelled to do for example religion

(1:47:33) that's a contradiction religion is a worldview that has duties and obligations you are not forced to do

(1:47:38) anything nobody talked about force what's wrong with your brain that's what you said no one said force then what

(1:47:43) does obligations mean if you're not compelled to do it what do you mean it's it's a it's basically like you said

(1:47:49) you're a Christian right yeah how else are you compelled are you do you have an obligation uh as a Christian to to what

(1:47:56) tell me any obligation on your mang mangled Christian view that's that you hold uh I suppose to uh be honest before

(1:48:04) God got you do you go to jail if you're not honest before God no but now you're changing what obligations

(1:48:10) i just demonstrated you could hold an obligation without any sort of force then why the [ __ ] were you talking about compelled obligations because we're

(1:48:16) talking about worldviews right if you as a feminist present feminism against say

(1:48:22) Christianity tonight and I counter with Christianity that is has tenfold

(1:48:27) obligations and duties baked into it by the argument that you just agreed to christianity which is patriarchal is

(1:48:34) better than feminism it's the end of the debate just another false dichotomy you're unironically making it seem like

(1:48:39) if Christianity exists then feminism can't and it's just like nobody said that you're just Yes you did look I How

(1:48:46) do you not know what a defeater is all I'm doing all I'm doing Jim Bob is I'm walking your own thoughts to their nth

(1:48:52) conclusion right uh yeah you're not dealing with that do I need to do it slower i am the issue is that you have

(1:48:57) changed so what you're doing is called equivocating you're muddying a definition so obligations you started by

(1:49:04) talking about like state obligations things that you were compelled to she keeps bringing the state in and I didn't

(1:49:09) bring the state in the argument you explicitly did because you were talking in my argument we were talking about

(1:49:15) military where is it in my argument uh do you find it there no sorry sorry

(1:49:21) are you just using obligations as a different word what like why are you using obligate well just before you were

(1:49:28) talking about obligations as a compelled thing from governments which the enforcement arm right you have a duty to

(1:49:33) your nation that's an obligation you can be compelled to do it now you're talking about obligations but I think what you

(1:49:40) mean is values these are not the same thing hold on a second so when you say obligations do you mean things that you

(1:49:46) can be forced to do that are punished if you don't do i'll give you another one that's answer my question when you are talking about obligations are you

(1:49:53) talking about things that you if you don't do that you ought to do you can No not ought that you can be forced to do

(1:49:59) well no i just demonstrated okay then feminism does have obligations of what you ought to do i Okay cool so you're

() 

(1:50:05) making moral ought claims right well now because remember you went Remember you went here with Jay are you sure you want

(1:50:10) to go there with me yeah of course because I [ __ ] dumpstered Jay on that too you couldn't tell me you couldn't

(1:50:15) tell him or the audience or me why from a feminist view we ought to do anything i did multiple times he just didn't

(1:50:22) accept the premise uh as a feminist you should so specifically the ought is that we should try to empower women and uh

(1:50:30) promote feminist that's not an argument that's an assertion do you know what an argument

(1:50:36) is okay buddy um premise one we should do the thing in question the evidence for this the evidence for this of why we

(1:50:42) ought to do this is that it is good for a society it is unavoidable and uh necess necess a necessity to maintain a

(1:50:49) competitive GDP in a global foreign nation it is also a morally good thing to basically uplift your sisters in

(1:50:56) Christ um and I think I got into another one wow so it's a Christian you're using

(1:51:01) a Christian paradigm or is it mixed you're doing like a sort of like uh Chipotle mixed burrito theology well

(1:51:08) there's going to be like moral claims there's some certain Christian cuz we share like a similar uh Christian value

(1:51:13) obviously we don't hold secular people to Christian moral systems right cuz they're secular this is obviously true

(1:51:19) okay so how is feminism Christian then i've not said that it's Christian necessarily i'm saying as Christians

(1:51:25) it's a good view you just said we should elevate women in Christ you're smuggling in a Christian view into your feminist

(1:51:31) view yeah i'm I'm arguing why I as a Christian think that like these feminist values are good but I'm not saying as a Christian you should be a feminism you

(1:51:38) should be a feminist sorry well I mean okay so back to the argument if it's the

(1:51:44) case that any worldview that has obligations and duties is better than

(1:51:50) one without and feminism actually doesn't really have any it does have obligations if we're just talking about

(1:51:56) things that you ought to do as a result of the world view right so like feminism for example would say that you ought to respect women you ought to give them

(1:52:02) consent you ought to allow them to like self-determine you ought to like treat women respectfully you ought to like

(1:52:08) look at feminine things and view them as good things these would be oughts that feminism would make ought you not as a

(1:52:16) feminist start and only fans uh that's mixed there's some feminists that are very uh No you you're the one debating

(1:52:24) tonight i don't think that I ought No I don't think there's any feminist who would say that you ought to I didn't

(1:52:30) talk about any feminist you're the feminist in the seat right now ought we from your view ought ought your friend

(1:52:38) be an only fans chick no I don't think it's a moral good to be an only fans chick okay so ought she ought not uh

(1:52:44) feminism would be pretty neutral on that by and large she my feminist view would be that you get to self-determine right

(1:52:50) so you get to make that choice so if you ought to self-determine and she determines that she ought she she should be online prostitute then she ought be

(1:52:58) an online prostitute this is no longer an ought statement at this point what the only ought statement is that woman

(1:53:03) should be allowed to self-determine after that what she chooses to do isn't necessarily morally good or morally bad

(1:53:09) we have to look at the actual behavior itself to evaluate if her choice in that behavior was morally good or morally bad

(1:53:16) the of feminism is just letting women make choices so so when is it in the behavior you determine that it's bad uh

(1:53:24) sorry I got distracted by that person's PFP because it was funny uh say that again when in the process of an action

(1:53:30) do you determine it's bad uh super uh complicated depends on your

(1:53:36) like moral system what a surprise yeah well of course like the moral system so like if this feminist for example is a

(1:53:42) utilitarian then we might like look at something like does porn negatively impact men and does sex work negatively

(1:53:48) impact you and I would say like for the majority of men and women both of these things are negative so that a

(1:53:53) utilitarian level that individual might decide you should not do wait this is this is contrary with your first ethical

(1:53:59) system which is merely that you should have a say in what you're doing is ultimately the prim the primary ethical

(1:54:06) view is that you have a choice in the matter that you can will your own behavior no this isn't super complicated

(1:54:11) you asked what are some of the odds of feminism one of the odds of feminis is that women should be able to choose what they do but that doesn't mean that all

(1:54:17) of their choices are morally good or morally bad let women have children if they can uh again uh I don't think it's

(1:54:24) a moral good to have children no it's not a moral good to have children no okay so how do you determine it's not a

(1:54:30) moral good to have children how do I determine that it's not a moral good yeah cuz that's a pretty affirmative

(1:54:35) statement that it's not a moral good to have children i didn't say it's bad right i didn't say it's not moral it's amoral it's neutral yeah i think having

(1:54:41) children's pretty neutral you can pretty much anyone can spread their legs and get sperm dumped into them i don't think it's like a particularly meaningful

(1:54:48) thing okay and you and you call yourself a Christian uh do you or not are you just laring or

() 

(1:54:54) what is it sorry well I'm assuming that there's an attack here right so the the the whole night is an attack why Why are

(1:55:00) you now that we're talking about trying to get your worldview it's all over the [ __ ] You're not You're not really trying to right like are you a Christian

(1:55:07) is a question well what you're doing is you're equivocating you're pivoting you're asking me a bunch of questions you're not really giving me any space to

(1:55:13) ask you questions back what you'll notice all the affirmative is you have not made a Who's the affirmative i don't

(1:55:19) know because there isn't actually a premise feminism is good for society is the affirmative that wasn't even what we

(1:55:25) agreed to to debate what do you mean we talked about just fleshing out the idea of like different branches of feminism

(1:55:31) neither one of us like made the same because you and I both agreed that it would be a little silly to rehash the

(1:55:36) same argument for the third time you call yourself some sort of Orthodox Protestant i don't even know if it's a meme i'm trying to get from your view

(1:55:43) it's called radical orthodoxy radical Orthodoxy okay for so revolutionary

(1:55:49) orthodoxy nope what's radical about it it's radical because it like aims to go back to like the way that the ancients

(1:55:55) engaged with the original scripture ancient who the ancients who like wrote it like the oral traditionists and stuff

(1:56:02) who are those uh that would be like 1200 BC to like uh probably like 30 AD oh so you're arguing that the

(1:56:13) original Orthodox church and the church fathers it's not Easter sorry I know Orthodox is confusing it's not like

(1:56:19) Eastern Orthodox term it's closer to Protestant oh Protestantis oh that was

(1:56:24) around then nope oh interesting protestants can still engage like again

(1:56:30) you're just doing the thing where you're like this word wasn't made so you can't like and analyze it from history like

(1:56:35) obviously as a Protestant you can look back at what the ancients did and try to divine some like meaning thing but again

(1:56:40) I want to be really cautious i'm not a spiritual leader i don't actually need to go into length about like talking about theology well that's fine i I

(1:56:47) don't I'm not uh super uh well-versed in it either but I just wanted to get the the peripheral basics because when you

(1:56:53) say it's not a moral duty a moral good into my religion then when we're talking

(1:56:59) about broad feminist because feminism like if once you get into ethics and morals you're actually going to have to

(1:57:05) pull in a theological view there's no avoiding it sure but like my main theological view is that like we should

(1:57:11) try to do well by others and treat them well and allow them as much as possible free choice and I think feminism is one

(1:57:17) of the means by which you offer women free choice right which I think is really free choice to act against theirelves yeah unfortunately God allows

(1:57:24) us to sin right okay but calling it sin you could make sin illegal right god

(1:57:29) does Hold on does God allow us to make laws yep but he is it sinful to murder

(1:57:35) yep so why do we put Unless it's self-defense why do we put No that's killing that's not murder um so if it's

(1:57:42) totally consistent under your worldview to make something that's sinful illegal why do you advocate That's not what I

(1:57:48) said is it okay under your worldview to make something that's sinful illegal uh by and large I think that like like what

(1:57:55) you should determine as a nation of what's legal and illegal should like at the most broadband work to capture

(1:58:02) multiple like uh ethical systems that people are bringing in because especially in America you've got this amalgamation of Protestants and

(1:58:08) Catholics and Eastern Orthodox uh and atheists and so I don't think like the government should bring a branch of like

(1:58:14) God do you think that something that's a sin can be made illegal can be yeah

(1:58:21) under your view is it okay under your feminist view right now that you're defending which is advocating for

(1:58:27) liberation the ability to choose and do things do as thou wilt essentially I don't think all sin should be illegal

(1:58:33) like for example cheating is a sin but I don't think it should be illegal i don't think you should be put in jail for cheating oh interesting okay so how do

(1:58:38) you determine which sins or transgressions from your uh ambiguous

(1:58:44) Christian Orthodox Protestant view um by the way is your Christian view informing

(1:58:50) your view of your feminism or is it uh probably yeah that's probably why for example okay so why is it that you would

(1:58:58) put uh someone in jail for one thing that's uh misaligned with your moral

() 

(1:59:03) code or from you're deriving from your Christian i'm not using my moral code to determine like what's legal or illegal

(1:59:09) what I'm doing is like looking at the dialogue of society to determine like which policies make for the best type of

(1:59:15) society so for example murdering being allowed is really bad for society because then you're not guaranteeing

(1:59:21) your citizens uh like individual safety which means that no citizen is ever

(1:59:26) going to buy into the government if the government can't guarantee their safety so murder is bad obviously but I don't think what's legal like legal or illegal

(1:59:33) should be our measures for what's morally good or morally the reason okay the reason I asked because if you agree that murder is bad and you you would

(1:59:41) actually make it illegal and there's a penalty um one of the elements is that it's not good for society it removes

(1:59:48) people from society and society is composed of people and you need people right for society that's not why I think

(1:59:55) murder is bad in But but you need people for society sure so having people for society is a good right sure i just Okay

(2:00:01) so if having good if having uh people for society is good under your view how

(2:00:07) is it that having a child is amoral uh because again I think anyone can spread their legs and have come dumped into

(2:00:13) them i don't think that it's meaningful to dump [ __ ] into a woman or to like and create a leg is it moral to feed your

(2:00:19) child uh to like a good parent yeah okay so this So I don't understand you're reducing the act of sex to be something

(2:00:27) mechanical and because it's mechanical and anyone can do it it's not moral but what's just as mechanical literally is

(2:00:34) feeding your kid food but that's moral what's the what's the symmetry breaker there uh the symmetry breaker is that typically when people have sex there's a

(2:00:40) lot of like self- serving hydonic like elements to it i don't think that like most sex that results in children I

(2:00:46) don't think is oriented towards having children i think it's having sex so it feels good whereas when you're caretaking your child you're like doing

(2:00:52) something by taking care of another person which is a good thing to do okay so you agree then even from your view which is antithetical to most feminist

(2:00:59) view that uh promiscuous sex is probably not a great idea no I think it's u

(2:01:04) pretty much bad for everyone okay but but you should be allowed to do it okay you should be allowed to do it but would

(2:01:10) you argue against it like uh saying don't do promiscuity yeah by Would you

(2:01:15) shame women uh shame women would not be what I would do it's just super ineffective shame's ineffective did you

(2:01:22) live through the karuna thing i don't know what that is uh I can't say

(2:01:27) it on the the co the cough cough the Oh the kof oh oh vid okay yeah yeah I got

(2:01:33) you uh did I live through it yes I did would you say during that time you you would argue that shame was ineffective

(2:01:41) uh yeah really i think force was more effective right people were getting No actually no force people were getting

(2:01:47) fined people were getting fired from their jobs right there was like more coercive pressure applied to people to comply there was that rather than shame

() 

(2:01:54) i don't think most people like put on a mask because they felt shamed they put on a mask because they knew they

(2:01:59) couldn't go into their workplace or travel from the person who's arguing there's a complexity and everything

(2:02:05) can't be reduced to force appeals to force here but doesn't appeal to the complexity of social shame and and the

(2:02:11) ability to structure society from actual pure shame so yeah because I think like

(2:02:17) when it comes to promiscuity for example right I don't want people to not be promiscuous because they're worried that like some that the like the unironic

(2:02:24) Iranian uh uh morality police are going to come into their home and beat them to death i think that that's a really bad

(2:02:30) strategy i also think it's a really bad strategy to be like we'll just [ __ ] hate you and no one will be your friend if you have promiscuous sex i also think

(2:02:37) that that doesn't work because they'll have sex they'll just be they'll just do it in secret what's more effective than

(2:02:42) shame is when people come to embody the values themselves right so if promiscuity is bad for women I want to

(2:02:47) advocate for that from a lens of like it is good for you to not be promiscuous not you're a bad dirty [ __ ] if you're

(2:02:53) promiscuous because I think it leads to a heart change and I think the heart change is fundamentally better for society i will grant that that's also

(2:03:02) uh might be effective um but to say that shame's not effective I wouldn't say that's either or i think there's a I

(2:03:08) should have specified shame is not effective at changing hearts and I think changing hearts is what matters because when it comes to promiscuity the reality

(2:03:14) is that it would work a little bit people would have less sex overall but you know what's been way more effective than like the Christian shaming for not

(2:03:20) having sex giving people phones and social anxiety gen Zed is having way less sex than ever before because they

(2:03:26) won't talk to each other right that's been way more effective than shaming people because if you look at Texas which was a state that was very

(2:03:33) religious very shamed didn't give a lot of sex education they're like the number one state for teen pregnancy so this

(2:03:38) idea that shame was effective at making all these teens not have sex not really they just do it in secret i want to go

(2:03:44) back to this one question is if

(2:03:49) a bunch of Christian women come forward and they hijack the term feminism and they redefine it to be fully submissive

(2:03:57) to a patriarchal system that's a Christian ethics system and fully backing it and defining feminism as the

(2:04:04) ultimate femininity is motherhood and uh being in the home from your view is

(2:04:11) there any standard you could argue that that's not feminism that's not my feminism that's not the feminism I'd be

(2:04:17) fighting for no so there's no true feminism i No like in the same way like there isn't any true like what's another

(2:04:24) uh uh uh anti-racism there isn't like a true anti-racism it's always like

() 

(2:04:30) morphing and shifting in a dialogue over time it's not operationally defined because it's not a scientific context okay that's the case could there be a

(2:04:37) type could there be a form of feminism that you couldn't possibly say isn't feminism that it was actually fully

(2:04:42) restrictive of women's liberties uh yeah i think for example if like people like this is feminism but all it is is like

(2:04:49) basically putting women in hijabs cutting off their clits and not allowing them to walk around outside I think

(2:04:54) everyone would agree that's nothing to do with feminism wait wait wait we're not talking about what people agree cuz

(2:05:00) uh throughout time people have agreed on some wacky [ __ ] the question is from your view as a feminist if you argue

(2:05:07) that there's no correct feminism there's just your feminism and I posit a counterfeminism that's inconsistent with

(2:05:14) your feminism what's the ultimate standard it's not whether people have a general intuition or they agree with it

(2:05:20) the question is do you have an absolute standard that's unchanging to say no that's not feminism i think as long as

(2:05:26) like the goal fundamentally is that we're like trying to lead to the betterment for women i think that seems decently foundational for to feminism is

(2:05:32) that's why that's what my definition is the betterment of women what if that form of feminism argued that from their

(2:05:38) model from their ethical system from their metrics that was the better that was better for women they can there's like an entire like tradife movement

(2:05:45) that's like very uh fe it's a feminist fourthwave wife movement so you're

(2:05:50) agreeing that from your own system which is completely subjective to your own opinion you have your own feminism right

(2:05:56) it's like a it's like a it's like your own innovation if if that's the case my

(2:06:01) own innovation yeah but there's no there's no standard do you know what like a social dialogue is like how zeitgeist emerge i'm saying there's no

(2:06:08) standard by which you can determine that something i understand but do you agree

(2:06:14) there is no standard for determining what feminism is in the same way that there's no standard by which you

(2:06:19) determine humanitarianism other than essentially there seems to be some precept which is that it should be for the betterment of women that's the

(2:06:25) standard right but no that's just pushes the standard of what's better no but the orientation of the people advocating as

(2:06:30) a feminist should ideally be advocating for things that lead to good outcomes for women i know do you understand when

(2:06:36) you say good outcomes now the new thing you're calling feminism is good outcomes and if it's not No but if you just said

(2:06:43) you asked me to like somewhat operationalize it the issue is what you're doing is again is that when it comes to zeitgeists they're always

(2:06:48) popular social dialogue they aren't operationalized fundamentally that's their nature this is why for example the

(2:06:54) skeptical is there any st I'll just ask liberalism I'll ask a different question let me finish I'm not done talking I

(2:06:59) know but you're not answering the question I am answering the question liberalism is a great example there are a whole bunch of ideas that are what

(2:07:05) liberalism is and liberalism is interesting because it's developed beyond that it has a couple of fundamental precepts that if you don't

(2:07:11) really value these things you're probably not a liberal so for example if you don't value women having some level

(2:07:18) of greater level of choice you're probably not a feminist I don't know why you would use that word you just

(2:07:23) contradicted yourself i just asked you if there's any standard by which you can tell someone they're not a feminist and

(2:07:29) you said no i said I said broadly yes i said it should be or no i said it should

(2:07:34) be oriented towards the betterment of women so is it possible that someone else has a standard for feminism that

(2:07:40) their betterment for women right cuz you're you're actually assuming that you've established a standard for better

(2:07:46) now if there's if it's the case from your own view no you're being semantic what do you mean semantic what does

(2:07:51) better mean how do you define humanitarianism i don't give a [ __ ] about humanitarianism i reject it it's an analogous satanic but what is it how

(2:07:59) do you define it's satanic that's how you define humanitarianism humanitarianism is a totally broad

(2:08:05) secular view of healing the world it's basically like a Talmudic uh basically worldview sure but I'm sure you would

(2:08:11) agree that if you're going to call yourself a humanitarian there's a certain level of like uh zeitgeist performance and thought that you should

(2:08:17) probably adopt well not really because that's why I debate them too and what I bring to the table is isn't it possible

(2:08:24) you can be a humanitarian and off twothirds of the population uh yes what you know what I hear

(2:08:31) humanitarianism utilitarianism so are at this point are you just mad because Loki

(2:08:36) mad Loki's wager exists for most zeitgeist or like ideological how is telling me I'm mad a counterargument to

(2:08:43) what I just said i Okay it's not i'm making fun of you stop okay making fun of me is not going to work you could

(2:08:48) make fun of me in addition to an argument like I do yeah that's what I'm doing right argument first just just to

(2:08:53) go back okay make fun of you you're big mad second second point um when it comes to ideological concepts they typically

(2:09:01) aren't that operationally defined but there's some level of collection identity that we tend to form around that like all of us kind of agree is

(2:09:08) some concept of feminism which is what Yes so you can Okay so you can agree

(2:09:14) something completely antithetical to those agreements right and it's still feminism no because none of the other feminists would agree to it right

(2:09:20) there's no collective the question is if you don't agree with previous feminists nobody would label something as feminist

(2:09:26) if it was like we should cut off women's clips and put them in jail everyone be like "That's not feminist aren't there

(2:09:32) existing feminists of different waves that would say you're not a feminist?" Yeah of course cool that I'm sorry good

(2:09:38) job you pointed out how ideologies work well no i'm pointing out that when I ask you is there a form of feminism that can

(2:09:46) be presented and aren't there Christians that could point at you and say that you're not a Christian they could try

(2:09:51) but there's actually a standard by which you can actually refute that yeah there's some level of standards as well for feminism it's not as Yes there is

(2:09:57) it's not as organized as something like a religion which is an institution what's the ultimate standard from which

(2:10:03) you're going to use when someone comes along and says "I'm a feminist and my form of feminism argues that the best

(2:10:10) thing for women is to limit their liberties." How do you counter and say you're not a real feminist because I

(2:10:16) would say broadly feminism is for giving women uh greater access of choice and

(2:10:21) equalizing them as far as like opportunity no you're defining that but I'm asking you that is broadly true is

(2:10:27) that objectively true nothing about this is objective you're talking about a Loki's wager concept so if it's the case

(2:10:34) that your description of feminism is giving them more opportunities and liberty and all the and credit cards and

(2:10:40) debt and all this [ __ ] and someone comes along and says "Well I'm actually redefining feminism to mean xyz is the

(2:10:46) good." I'm asking you without asserting your your what you think is good do you

(2:10:51) have a standard to which that you can use to say that this new one is not true

(2:10:57) no essentially you can always self ID into most ideological groups the issue is that the ideological group will likely reject you right so it's like

(2:11:03) yeah there are feminists that don't think I'm feminist but by and large there is a lot of feminists who agree with most of my precepts because I am

(2:11:10) for the empowerment and betterment of women which almost every single feminist on the planet has ever existed would be

(2:11:15) like okay yeah that's obviously some element of feminism you're bringing What do you mean you're bringing this up i'll

() 

(2:11:22) do it slower slower okay your definition assumes a standard for

(2:11:27) betterment do you understand that yeah and that's what like the uh philosophical debate will be yes of course so when someone comes and

(2:11:34) redefineses their standard for better I'm asking you a simple question there's Kyla's better for women and then there's

(2:11:41) an antithetical view for women that's has a different standard for better what's the ultimate standard to

(2:11:47) determine which one's better it's it's not an institution there isn't one there is no standard by which you determine

(2:11:53) any feminism is good or bad it's it's an ideological group of course not premise one feminism is good for society premise

(2:11:59) two there's no standard for good for society again like I know you think that this is

(2:12:05) a really strong argument well it's a defeater no it's obviously the case that when it comes to like ideological

(2:12:10) philosophical things like egalitarianism or utilitarianism there are certain

(2:12:16) things that you kind of have to agree on like trying to like lead to good outcomes for women with the good

(2:12:21) outcomes broadly being defined to some degree as freedom of opportunity that if

(2:12:27) you claim to be feminist but all you want to do is reduce opportunity almost every single feminist universally will

(2:12:34) reject you but obviously there's this gray window in between like Loki's wager

(2:12:39) where we're not quite sure where the head and the neck start where we can cut off and say this is clearly what

(2:12:44) feminism is and this is clearly what it's not but something that we can say that is not feminism is somebody who wants to point hijabs on women and cut

(2:12:50) off their clits like we can agree with that that's their feminism no feminism they can just No they can just say it's

(2:12:56) their feminism yeah of course they can just say and you can't say [ __ ] back basic you can't I would basically be

(2:13:02) like "Yeah you'd have to make a historical argument for what feminism is." Right sure uh to some call back sup

(2:13:08) Jay again that's not a call back because all I was doing in that debate was asking him to define a word and he

(2:13:14) refused to and obuscated from defining the word because he knew that if he defined the word then there would be operations by which and norms that we

(2:13:20) could actually talk about things and if he couldn't gish gallop and like obuscate with like uh philosophy

(2:13:25) [ __ ] then he he didn't have anything to talk about right which is why he basically said I won't do norms which is

(2:13:31) saying I will not actually be good faith with you in this conversation which is fine that was Jay's choice to do but it

(2:13:37) made it a useless conversation unfortunately which I appreciate that you were not doing mostly do you want to

() 

(2:13:42) take that brief break right now uh we're going to take a uh slight break or Kylo is anyways uh just a slight break slight

(2:18:24) actually live like 5 hours from You live next to me well that makes me really

(2:18:30) feel nice inside look it's as simple as this i actually agree with Jim Bob i'm

(2:18:36) going to try to steal man you you believe that it's actually best for women ultimately to be in the home

(2:18:43) correct no yes that's what she said she's a liar demon spawn good one clean

(2:18:51) your kitchen got it i think we need a champagne pop for that jordan Peterson

(2:18:56) impression that was really good uh thank you and in fact if we do get a champagne pop Jim Bob has to do the rest of the

(2:19:03) show as No I will not it'll ruin my my entire soul he'll do the last 10 minutes

(2:19:08) of the show as Jordan Peterson how about that uh okay we have Inquisitor Zeal here guys if by the way get one in $100

(2:19:14) inquisitor Zal donated $100 thank you Inquisitor she said "Depends on your moral system and that individual might

(2:19:21) decide." So again she's saying that each individual is the source of moral duty

(2:19:27) her ego is her god individualism is her religion

(2:19:33) uh no uh most people tend to use some level of like a secular utilitarian

(2:19:39) framework which is broadly what people like operate off of um when I try to evaluate people's like moral systems I

(2:19:44) try to understand like what they believe i hold them to what they believe first and foremost and then what their society believes and then there are certain

(2:19:50) things that I think are like greater moral imperatives that like most people would universally agree you should follow like cannibalism is bad most

(2:19:57) people would agree with Is your husband also whatever share your Christian uh

(2:20:02) view radical orthodox he does does that view hold that he's

(2:20:08) ultimately the say in the house like pointing in the direction of where you guys are going where you live uh yeah

(2:20:15) like more he's he's like the final veto but he's um he truly understands that

(2:20:21) like the wife is uh is the church to Christ right like he's the head and

(2:20:27) you're the neck as in like Christ died for the body and so there's a there's a

(2:20:32) leading from like deep care right like Nick Nick doesn't tell me that I must

(2:20:37) respect him because he's a man i respect Nick's decisions even when we might

(2:20:42) disagree because he fundamentally has the best interest for both of us in mind and I trust him in that i don't think

(2:20:47) all husbands are that way nick is exceptional that's what I'm asking is if you guys had a disagreement on a direction or an issue or I would honor

(2:20:53) him even if you actually knew maybe you were correct

(2:20:59) uh yeah basically I'd honor him and what is that's derivative of your Christian

(2:21:04) view right uh yeah do you think a society made up of women who follow that

() 

(2:21:10) is better than a society of rebellious women who don't follow that uh no because I don't think most men uh

(2:21:16) actually deserve the level of respect that I give Nick that might be true but if it were the case that they were all

(2:21:22) Nicks would it be better for the rest of the women to be you yeah if everyone was

(2:21:27) a [ __ ] amazing person yeah society would be better i sure yeah of course

(2:21:33) okay but men are not like most men are not Nick most I understand i'm just saying there there is a circumstance in

(2:21:38) which you actually do submit as the woman in the house to the leader who's the man it's reflective of a Christian

(2:21:45) view even if we disagree on on uh the truth of Christianity between us or our our doctrine or whatever is that um

(2:21:52) ultimately if it were the case that men were fulfilling the role of a Christian

(2:21:57) patriarch in a sense for the family in society it would make sense to you that the women would then follow the men

(2:22:03) right uh yeah like by and large I just think like uh most modern forms of like

(2:22:08) fundamental Christianity set up men to be extremely bad patriarchs i don't think that they're Christ to the church

(2:22:14) at all they don't die for their women they don't like put their family first foremost um I think Christian men are

(2:22:21) oftentimes extremely led astray uh and very cruel and I think a good man also

(2:22:26) respects his woman and like listens to her and takes her uh thoughts and opinions very seriously in like weighing

(2:22:31) out decisions right i mean that's what I'm just getting i just wanted to get to it sounds like a type of version of

(2:22:38) Christianity you're really partial to that if it was multiplied it would make

(2:22:43) sense to hold the patriarchal uh view and practice inside of a country and

(2:22:49) then even inside of the home it would make sense for the women to follow the man if these conditions were met i just

(2:22:54) wouldn't force it ever i don't believe in a society that forces these things right but it's you would advocate for it

(2:23:00) uh the forcing or like No no just advocate for the that patriarchal hierarchal system uh I don't know if I

(2:23:08) would advocate for that for non-Christians cuz I I Yeah I understand like why would

(2:23:13) the man ever have Well I agree i think um I think uh secular marriage and all that uh is

(2:23:21) is a useless like thing to do from their paradigm doesn't even make sense why you

(2:23:27) why unless it was strictly like this law-based advantage but you know when when we marry in Christianity we're

(2:23:34) married to something bigger than each other yeah there's the covenant with Christ there's a whole thing to it whereas a secular marriage you're

(2:23:41) basically marrying each other's preferences until they change uh I think most secular people would disagree with

(2:23:46) you pretty strongly on that i think a lot of secular people still embody a pretty high value for like long-term

(2:23:51) commitment um I just think that when it comes to like a secular relationship like for me when I look at that they're

(2:23:58) missing like a core cornerstone that pulls them together long-term over time which would be Christ but that's not

(2:24:03) something I would ever right but here's the difference here is that um from a Christian position even like uh the

(2:24:11) whole variety of Christian Christian um proponents they have an act they have an

(2:24:16) obligation to stay married like that would be the ideal right there's an obligation there a moral obligation

(2:24:22) secularism has no there's no real moral obligation i would disagree like for example the moment that you have

(2:24:27) children for example um I think there's an extremely high pressure even for secular people to try to make it work

(2:24:34) right children have adopted into their

(2:24:43) broadmerame loyalty that's earned over time because I think most people recognize that loyalty regardless of God

(2:24:49) is val I'm just saying there's a I'm saying the difference between just a mere intuition that they should probably

(2:24:54) make it work versus an obligation that's beyond their own preferences it's not an intuition right unless they're like

(2:25:01) moral intuitivists which most people are like not early most people aren't anything most people don't have like a

(2:25:07) way this way but they broadly have a utility do you attend a place that's a building that you call a church okay um

(2:25:14) the other people at your church who know you're married if your marriage was in trouble it would make sense that not

(2:25:20) only they're obligated but they're there to support you uh in your marriage right

(2:25:26) again when you say obligated do you mean it's something that is good to do yeah

(2:25:32) it's a part of the Christian uh practice that that you're actually because you're

(2:25:37) married to a church essentially of something bigger that you're actually you're trying to keep that intact in a

(2:25:43) way it's not just your little uh temporal relationship but I'm saying in

(2:25:48) a secular view they don't actually have something bigger outside of themselves even if you include a kid they're just

(2:25:54) making the marriage include another person but there's nothing outside of them that they're appealing to that's

(2:26:01) bigger than them metaphysically spiritually it's just like not spiritually obviously but they have like the the community that you're appealing

(2:26:08) to that the Christians have most secular people have a very um interconnected

(2:26:13) community that would be pushing towards that relationship working out being the in-laws and probably the shared mutual

(2:26:19) friends right and ideally I think most secular people would agree that the community of friends that is around this

(2:26:25) couple if they're having issues should come around them and support them and obviously like hope and wish and try to

(2:26:30) help in whatever way they can to help that couple stay together i think most secular people hold this value interesting i don't know if that's act I

(2:26:37) don't know that might be the case it's just that it seems to me if if they're secular they're looking at basically

(2:26:44) they're measuring like tradeoffs like like material trade-offs like well this

(2:26:49) could be an advantage but then you weigh it against this and from that view I feel like what I'm trying to say is that

(2:26:55) the paradigm that's judging the the trial and tribulation what it is is

(2:27:01) fundamentally different between a Christian and a secular like how they frame the problem it's fundamentally different the issue is that like I think

(2:27:07) Christians and non-Christians get divorced at pretty much the same rate so it's like yeah I would agree that like

(2:27:13) the systems by which they derive their value of loyalty is different it doesn't

(2:27:18) change that the value of loyalty is there and it doesn't work for about 50% of couples anyways right yeah maybe yeah

(2:27:26) a Christianity will also cause like marriages to stay together forever that are deeply loveless and like awful right

(2:27:31) which is like something that I don't think is good necessarily like Christians will look at the 30-year

(2:27:37) couple that [ __ ] hate each other they just live with each other and they'll be like "Look at what a good thing." It's

(2:27:42) like "That's not a good thing that's death." Like two people that live together that forgot the shadow of what

(2:27:47) it meant to be in love just gripping on because like they feel God tells them to

(2:27:53) that's not God's will at all what they should be doing is like surrendering themselves and figuring out what the

(2:27:58) issue is yeah that's why I think um Christianity has a better perspective

() 

(2:28:03) because they can actually even against your preferences in the moment it's

(2:28:09) actually uh it's probably a good thing to have people externally also

(2:28:14) accountable to you staying together i just think that's stronger i just think that's stronger from a Christian view

(2:28:19) even if you're It does sound stronger at a logical level to some degree the issue is it just it's not borne out in any of

(2:28:25) the stats and I would add to that I don't know if you were going in this direction it shouldn't be law it

(2:28:30) shouldn't be a law it should not no i think when like um Christianity blends with politics like power and politics I

(2:28:37) think it ruins the faith i think it's really bad for the faith wait a second that's interesting because you agreed

(2:28:43) before that if a Christian votes on a policy you wouldn't you wouldn't expect

(2:28:49) them to not vote on a policy without it being it being informed by their theology right uh yeah but that doesn't

(2:28:56) mean that Christianity like I I don't believe in like theocracies like I I don't think Christianity should run the

(2:29:03) country i think I understand but a theocracy let's say isn't it already the case that people who have a Christian

(2:29:10) view if they get elected as a representative of the people because of

(2:29:15) their Christian view they're also saying that their Christian view is going to inform the policies so in fact it's

(2:29:22) unavoidable to live in a system even a pluralistic system like ours it's unavoidable for people to pursue

(2:29:29) politics and not have it have their theology influence what the policy

(2:29:35) almost at all uh unless unless there's somebody running who's like I'm going to get rid of freedom of religion then I

(2:29:41) would vote for my theology if I got you but I'm saying I vote on foreign policy i don't think it's fundamental that Christians need to vote based on their

(2:29:47) faith and I actually think that it leads to a lot of What else would they vote on though what nation states are for which

(2:29:53) is like foreign policy and sovereignty i think it's way more important to have a president that like knows how to navigate global trade and to be like a

(2:30:01) nice Christian guy hold on a second what's informing ethically cuz when you

(2:30:06) vote you're informed by some meta metaethical view i'm I'm a I'm a real Do

(2:30:11) you know what real politic is no it's like a philosophy of politics that's like deeply pragmatic and devoid of

(2:30:18) moral moral stuff like you don't It's impossible nope uh it's impossible it's just pure pragmatism no pragmatism

() 

(2:30:24) there's no way cuz then you're saying then you're making an ought claim to do the most pragmatic thing that's not a

(2:30:30) moral claim ought we do the most pragmatic thing that's not a moral claim it's not nope not at like a government's

(2:30:36) level oh so the government that I think is going to enact the best policy for the my

(2:30:42) sovereignty to do well is your sovereignty a morally good thing or not

(2:30:47) it's neutral but like I like if I violate your sovereignty is it immoral uh depends on how you violate it but uh

(2:30:54) if I violate your sovereignty your your free will invade yeah yeah like just invade limit your ability to move uh do

(2:31:01) things in the world if it's the case Kyla yeah like at an individual i understand but do you understand the

(2:31:07) intellation immoral if it invades your sovereignty cuz you're we're talking about nations now again well I'm

(2:31:13) pointing to a nation consists of its people so there's an individual level and a collective level of a nation

(2:31:19) sovereignty isn't about like I don't have an individual sovereignty for a country to protect to

(2:31:26) keep its identity sovereign against foreign invasion a moral good yeah

(2:31:32) because isn't it wouldn't it be immoral for another nation to invade your the

(2:31:38) sovereignty and break the sovereignty is it immoral to break somebody else's sovereignty i need to think about that i'm not sure but I don't know if it's

(2:31:44) moral i think it's just fundamental like why are you a nation if you're not protecting sovereignty to like I

(2:31:50) understand but I think that this example is perfect because if it's the case that

(2:31:56) it's immoral if you want to think about it further it's fine but just think about it this way if it's immoral for

(2:32:02) another nation to invade another and break up its sovereignty and violate all that if that's immoral then it's moral

(2:32:08) to fight against that uh yep uh I'm just that's why I said I'm not sure like it

(2:32:14) my knee is like yeah it feels icky to invade other sovereignty is it moral though i'm not sure it's hard to it's

(2:32:21) hard to view nations at like a moral and immoral level well that's why I point to They probably can so it probably is but

(2:32:30) again there might be reasons by which you invade another country's sovereignty that are like legitimate like taking out terror cells will it be morally

(2:32:37) legitimate yeah like um um taking out terror cells in Lebanon is Yeah that's what I'm saying is if you vote on

(2:32:42) foreign policy you're ultimately asking a metaethical or moral question given the situation so it's never that's why I

(2:32:49) say pragmatism even if you establish some sort of strict rules of like outcomes that you like or don't like

(2:32:55) ultimately when we press you on it you're going to actually have to eventually you'll be forced just like the example I gave to give a moral

(2:33:02) statement about something because pragmatism Yeah i just demonstrated no when I'm talking about foreign policy

(2:33:08) I'm not talking about like moral behavior what I'm mostly talking about is like free trade and things that like

(2:33:13) better my living as a result of how we engage with like the global let's take let's take even more of a domestic issue

(2:33:19) because the the conversation and I want to debate this more with other people is this conversation of like keep your

(2:33:25) theology out of my my business keep your theology out of politics keep it out of policy right this is a constant thing

(2:33:32) well do you are you for like welfareism safety nets yep okay so from your

(2:33:39) perspective Do you take an amoral approach to help people in their safety net like with

(2:33:44) their safety nets uh as like an individual or is it just pragmatic that

(2:33:49) you should help people in need it's definitely super pragmatic it's it's also moral okay some things can be moral

(2:33:55) and pragmatic okay so is that an example of you being totally fine voting on a

(2:34:01) policy that's both pragmatic and moral if it's informed by your your theology uh yeah sure i'm I'm not opposed to

(2:34:07) people like just vote like I Yeah i don't know what you think my idea is i'm not opposed to people voting because of

(2:34:14) their theology i'm opposed to people voting only for their theology right because the best president for our

(2:34:20) nation isn't just like the nice Christian guy it's the guy who understands how to interact with our

(2:34:25) like global neighbors well I understand but that just comes back to how do what paradigm is evaluating the interaction

(2:34:32) if it's not your if it's not ultimately your theology it's pretty pragmatic right because you can have a president who's a massive bag of like bag of dicks

(2:34:40) he's just a shitty person but he's really good at trade he gets us really good trade deals the allies really like

(2:34:46) him and he does a really good job of like breaking up the axis of resistance right but he's a [ __ ] right i

(2:34:52) understand but that's so that's the you're now switching it to who you vote

(2:34:57) for that does stuff what I'm asking is even if you voted for a total atheist

(2:35:02) that just somehow I did switch it you were talking about who I would vote for well I'm saying so I didn't switch well I'm saying to be clear vote for or

(2:35:08) policies so if they're conjoined that's fine it's Yeah but I wasn't switching i don't know why you said I'm saying isn't it possible that a total douchebag who

(2:35:16) doesn't even share your values for some reason uh um is really good at executing

(2:35:22) all the policies you support right that's what I said okay if that's possible aren't you still voting for

(2:35:28) them based on your theological evaluation of what you think is good nope i would no what's evaluating what's

(2:35:35) good then pragmatism yeah pragmatism it when you say what works yeah but why

(2:35:40) isn't something that works aren't you saying it's morally good that it works because there's things that can be like beneficial that are morally neutral so

(2:35:47) you want to benefit society but but your standard for what benefits society isn't

(2:35:53) a moral claim or an ethical claim sometimes it's a moral claim and sometimes it's not a moral claim right where like the like like this is the

(2:35:59) problem with using the word good is that like good can mean moral but it can also just mean something functional like good outcome right or performance like a good

(2:36:06) basketball team is performatively good but they're not morally good because they're awesome or if I buy a Porsche

(2:36:12) right it's like a good exchange the guy who sells it to me is happy I'm happy because I have a Porsche it's not morally good to buy a Porsche right but

(2:36:18) then it gets into uh fuzzy territory when you like for the examples of like invading terror cells exactly which is

(2:36:25) why I granted you where I'm like uh invading sovereign feels icky but there's probably a number of situations where I would think it's legitimate like

(2:36:31) invading terrorist like I think bombing the Houthies was great based bomb them away [ __ ] those guys yeah but you said

(2:36:37) that someone shouldn't vote primarily on their theology but even if they voted for a guy who doesn't believe what they

() 

(2:36:44) believe but all of their policies aligned with their the voters's theology

(2:36:49) the the voter could still vote on the total bag of dicks right fully on their

(2:36:55) based on their theology and it would actually this is the thing here here put it this way isn't it possible that

(2:37:01) voting fully on your theology is the most pragmatic thing nope it's not possible what i don't I don't think so

(2:37:08) no there's a lot of there's a lot of things that Christians do based on our religion that like is less functional

(2:37:14) like this is why the path to hell is wide and the path to heaven's narrow because it's really hard to just do

(2:37:21) always the morally upright thing it's really difficult and I don't want to hold nations to that standard i want

(2:37:26) nations to mostly operate in neutrality by and large and benefit us i understand what you're saying but you just said

(2:37:33) it's logically impossible that an instance of voting fully on your theology can't be pragmatic yeah so like

(2:37:41) in the Christian theology well yeah I substantiated why because I think as a Christian like Christians um at a

(2:37:48) spiritual level I think are often required to do things that are deeply unpragmatic because it's the right I understand that actually I think I think

(2:37:55) like a a purely Christian leader who's operating out of Christian principles is

(2:38:00) probably going to make a pretty ineffective nation leader i agree that a lot of times we're challenged with pragmatism or what's good and what's

(2:38:08) good isn't always what's pragmatic i'm not arguing whether that those things can um not align at some points often

(2:38:14) they don't but that's a different question of whether it's logically possible to have to vote on a policy

(2:38:22) that's wholly aligned and and informed by your theology and it's also pragmatic

(2:38:28) well like policy no no no well you said a leader like a leader is more than one policy one policy yeah of course it can

(2:38:34) be pragmatic and theological when you said is can you vote for some person who represents all of your theology and have

(2:38:41) him be also the most pragmatic leader and I was like uh for Christianity probably not because Christianity is

(2:38:48) constantly dying to self turning the other cheek like the ultimate Christian leader probably shouldn't bomb anyone so

(2:38:55) you don't hold a view that most of the uh secular worldview uh holds is that

(2:39:01) they always say um I'm fine with you believing what you believe it's just

(2:39:06) when you um you inform policy from that and you enforce XYZ right yeah like I

(2:39:13) don't want Sharia law i don't like that right but that's a particular kind of thing i agree with you but if I can't if

(2:39:18) I if I tell Muslims that their religious practice can't be like telling me what to do i can't tell secularists that my

(2:39:26) religious practice now gets to tell them what to do at a criminal level i understand but that means that if you

(2:39:31) held that position like most secularists do they are arguing from this position that

(2:39:37) says "I just don't want to force my beliefs on you and I don't want you and I don't want you to force your beliefs

(2:39:43) on me." Right y that's what they're saying however the problem is there are people who let's say don't believe in rights

(2:39:51) yep isn't it the case that the group of people who believe in rights given that's a belief are forcing their belief

(2:39:57) on other people uh I mean I think you can technically like there's like a

(2:40:02) thing where you can become like an uncitizen essentially oh those people yeah they don't do very well you can Yeah it's just it's just [ __ ] like

(2:40:09) yeah I suppose we're like forcing people to have human rights but that's just like the trade-off that we're willing to do there are some things Well some

(2:40:15) people don't are born into it we also force people not to murder right we like force people to pay taxes there's lots

(2:40:21) of things that we force people to do one of the things that I think we shouldn't do is force religion as a Christian

(2:40:27) specifically because I want people to find Christ and like his gift of

(2:40:33) salvation is like what turns their hearts to him i'm not advocating force i'm I'm not advocating for force uh you

(2:40:39) can't force people to believe things for one but you can't uh I'm not saying the I'm not advocating I'm actually running

(2:40:46) just a basic hypothetical uh an inquiry to demonstrate that it's actually

(2:40:51) impossible to live in an ordered society without a predominant belief being forced onto people and the question only

(2:40:58) becomes what are the beliefs so it's like I'm a liberal right so like my

(2:41:04) answer to that predicament is like the beliefs we should have should probably maximize things like freedom of choice

(2:41:10) freedom of like association freedom of movement freedom of thought and freedom of speech these things seem to be damn

(2:41:17) near miraculous that we came to when we look historically at societies that didn't have this thing it's not a good

(2:41:23) time can I ask a clarification about that list sure do you uh you said freedom of movement i usually debate a

() 

(2:41:30) libertarian on this particular topic sure would you include in that list I don't know if you said it but freedom uh

(2:41:36) like property like owning property uh like do I believe in private property

(2:41:42) yeah I believe in property cool so if you include that um if it were the case

(2:41:47) that all of the land every square inch of the US was owned privately then you

(2:41:52) would have no freedom of mobility yeah yeah those Palestinians play it right now yes so like this is the classic Calvin and Hobbes question which is that

(2:41:59) like freedom often comes in tension with security because there's certain freedoms that we always opt to give up

(2:42:05) to maintain security this is why open borders is usually not a good idea because if you have open borders you have no level of security for your

(2:42:11) nation right which is why borders are valuable and it's a restriction on a freedom of movement that most people are

(2:42:18) willing to accept in exchange for the security do you agree that most women feminists vote in favor of security over

(2:42:26) liberty cuz that's the that's the that's the stat when you say security do you mean like personal security or general

(2:42:33) it could be personal it could be just a general like well I want to be safe which is totally aligned with their

(2:42:39) nature like to want to be safe but the problem is if you and I both agree that there is this constant tension and dance

(2:42:45) between freedom and security and it happens to be the case that women voting actually work against what both of you

(2:42:51) and I think is generally something you have to explore well I like both of these things like

(2:42:57) have you ever read Jonathan Height um so you know his idea of like the moral

(2:43:02) presuppositions that back behind conservativism versus like liberalism and the value systems and these are

(2:43:07) pretty biological in fact it's like more than ide yeah exactly okay so you're familiar so in my mind essentially yes

(2:43:15) women if they were more concerned about personal security probably would be more pro-rightwing but I think women just

(2:43:22) prioritize things like caring for others more than they do for that thing right i understand but let's like I just want to

(2:43:28) point something out of women if it were the case that women were still in the home and and uh held the position of the

(2:43:37) woman in the home from a Christian lens and the man held the position as the provider and protector of the home the

(2:43:43) thing that they're earn that they're yearning for without that like let's say they didn't have a husband or anybody it

(2:43:49) makes sense that they're going to look for the security in the government if they don't have it directly in their

(2:43:55) environment right i mean I'm married with a husband with a gun and I definitely look for security from my

(2:44:01) government before I look for it from my husband really yeah i'd prefer to call the police than be like "Nick go get him." Yeah obviously police have body

(2:44:08) armor they have like tactical training yeah but the Yeah but the police have no obligation to protect you uh typically

(2:44:13) when you have a house intruder you can call them and they will protect you well no they are going to uh get the guy who

(2:44:20) violated a crime but they actually have no obligation to protect you like like

(2:44:26) stop you know what I mean i know we we did this song and dance before i just think you're like being a little bit finiggly with words right like obviously

(2:44:33) when I'm like the Supreme Court though I understand right but the issue is that Supreme Court is specifically finiggly

(2:44:39) with words i imagine if you ask most police officers what do they say their duty is to serve and protect right serve

(2:44:46) and protect what not people no that's a that's a slogan it's not people you You think police officers don't feel that

(2:44:52) they're trying to serve and protect citizens no they're serving something and they're they're protecting what the

(2:44:59) community no they're protecting basically the the law and the constitution i think they're serving the law and they're protecting It's both

() 

(2:45:05) they're not protecting you that's for sure i mean I mean they don't think you're using a

(2:45:11) colloquialism like like I understand the colloquial uh aspect of what you're saying it's just that actually like they

(2:45:19) have no obligation to protect you it's just good to know that if that's the case then Nick your husband should take

(2:45:27) that to heart and say you know what if someone's in the home if it's a choice

(2:45:32) between calling the cops and waiting and having your your gun out well these are

(2:45:37) not this is a false i understand that's not either or but if it's the case that you're waiting for the police but you

(2:45:42) could actually Yeah you should also have self-defense should you stop the intruder before the police come then yeah of course but that's not like what

(2:45:49) I'm arguing for right like I'm obviously You would you would hide and wait for the police to show up and it's like are

(2:45:54) you trained in in in using a weapon uh yeah oh good why wouldn't you Why would you be trained in using a weapon to not

(2:46:01) use the weapon i don't understand because of one gun and Nick's definitely going to use the weapon before I do [ __ ] that [ __ ] so you affirm gender roles uh

(2:46:08) yeah he's also better with the gun in fairness like if I if he hadn't ever used a gun before and I was like very I

(2:46:14) was like a My dad is like this like highly competitive he's like a super shooter whatever and if say I trained

(2:46:21) under my dad then I should have the gun in the case of the home intruder but he's better with the gun he's got more

(2:46:26) comfortability with violence it's more his pension to do interesting so I this How about this idea i'm also a [ __ ]

(2:46:32) when it comes to violence when you're walking on the street given that logic do you think that the man has an

(2:46:39) obligation let's say you're walking on the street and there's an aggressor across the street and you know that

(2:46:44) something can be done perhaps to stop you don't know if you're going to win or not do you think you're obligated to go

(2:46:50) or your husband to go fight the aggressor neither people are obligated

(2:46:55) you have no obligation when you say obligated do you mean they ought to well yeah that you ought to from from your

(2:47:01) view that you ought to help the person yeah but I would say like a police officer ought to to a much higher degree

(2:47:07) this is why after like the school shooting in Texas when the officers just waited outside even though technically they're not obligated to go in and

(2:47:13) intervene with the shooter while they're allowed every single person in society said these cops are what's not a slur uh

(2:47:22) [ __ ] losers yeah [ __ ] losers right so there's there's this premise of like yeah police don't aren't obligated to

(2:47:28) protect us but obviously we have a social expectation that like we probably should try to intervene well that's what

(2:47:34) I'm saying is like from a from a societal view um if everyone knew

(2:47:40) everyone held a view that they were obligated to aggress against people who were who were doing harm or doing

(2:47:46) illegal things even before the cops arrived i feel like we live in a society that's so like closed off you're afraid

(2:47:53) to like intervene on anything uh you're just closed off your own individual

(2:47:58) bubble you're like I'm not dealing with that um I feel like that's a a kind of a breakdown of the moral fabric and and to

(2:48:05) tie it back into feminism the reason I asked that question is I wondered if

(2:48:11) debating you on gender roles is not is just a not like we already agree like

(2:48:16) that you affirm gender roles the the main difference would be I would never compel women to be in any specific gender role or men right i I'm fine with

() 

(2:48:23) the fact that men and women tend to naturally fall into these dynamics and as long as it works for the couple that's fine my biggest thing I'm I'm

(2:48:30) truly a liberal in the most obnoxious way i want people to choose i want people to have choice and I hate it when

(2:48:38) big government tries to force choices especially when it comes to private lives i think that's bad but do you plan

(2:48:43) on being a mother uh probably i don't know if I can okay like at a biological

(2:48:49) level just because of like some health stuff but I'd like to well the reason I asked that is like if you have a a son

(2:48:55) or a daughter let's say you have a son and you perceive that his natural in

(2:49:03) inclination is more gentle but you also know it's better for him in the long run

(2:49:09) to develop some sort of ability to be an aggressor if he needed to would you

(2:49:14) inter would you intervene with what you thought his natural inclination was and

(2:49:19) nudge him into something that occurred to you as unnatural uh to like make him more functional

(2:49:25) probably to some degree but I think if he resisted it to a high level there's a certain level of like yeah you want your

(2:49:31) kids to be likable and like function in society and I think good parents should try to like help that happen but if you

(2:49:37) have a kid who's so atypical from society that to force him into that would do more damage than to not then

(2:49:43) you should I understand i'm just saying like like there's more to this is that it's it's beyond gender it's like

(2:49:49) especially if you if you say you you hold a Christian view you're constantly

(2:49:56) battling against human proclivities and what people are naturally drawn to do

(2:50:02) now you're just assuming well people are naturally toward certain um certain um

(2:50:08) talents or things like this but that includes people being drawn to proclivities that you actually have to

(2:50:14) correct and that's why it it does tie back to feminism because um I'm glad you push back at least you're reserved about

(2:50:23) women arguing that they're super empowered doing pornography at age 24 or

(2:50:29) or younger or older and they're not considering long-term effects of it uh

(2:50:34) what like you said you're judging the the behavior based on the future self like would you still do this like

(2:50:42) current and past yeah yeah which is obviously very difficult to do uh but um

(2:50:47) that's why that's why I think you can't really hold a Christian view and not be in a constant uh potential state of

(2:50:54) intervention not just with your family but with society itself at at large uh I

(2:50:59) think I think it's just this like tension it it there's a there's an element it's the Calvin and Hobbes again there's a certain level of like freedom

(2:51:06) that you want people to have to self-actualize i think that like diversity of ideas and concepts and

(2:51:11) individuals is good and when I say diversity I don't mean like skin color that's fine too when I talk about diversity though I mean like different

(2:51:18) expressions of humanity i think that's really good and there's a certain level of like nudging towards social

(2:51:23) normativity that helps people function and flourish and when you have kiddos I think you have to constantly do the

(2:51:29) tension of letting your kiddos be them and also teaching them like Yeah the whole diversity thing I think is kind of

(2:51:34) [ __ ] because um you would have to include people in public walking each

(2:51:40) other on like leather and like they're they're in like leather panties and stuff that's diversity right no like

(2:51:46) you're making like a slippery soap fallacy just because I like want people to be able to like do and like self-express that doesn't mean that I

(2:51:52) want ultimate maximal self-expression otherwise like Dexter would be like I love killing people no no forget about

(2:51:58) the ill forget about the aggressing on other people this is where basically

(2:52:03) every libertarian argument uh goes which you you kind of are libertarian it sounds like would you categorize

(2:52:09) yourself as like a libertarian feminist or something no I'm I'm pretty like standard liberal like I really am cuz I

(2:52:16) I I just to be clear I'm still pro welfare state and still pro like uh

(2:52:22) market regulation this is why I liberal camp it's ultimately going to be your theological view and your ethical view

(2:52:29) that's going to try to justify the forceful intervention of public

() 

(2:52:35) degeneracy in instances where nothing's being actually broken no properties being damaged there's nothing being

(2:52:41) stolen there's no one actually physically being aggressed or harmed but it's degenerate

(2:52:48) right yep yeah and it's way more it's like um you say you have a person and they love [ __ ] in public and they

(2:52:54) also clean up after themselves so they drop their pants they take a massive [ __ ] in the middle of the street you

(2:52:59) hear that libertarians and then they clean up after themselves right there's this question like the libertarian bees like well they should be able to do that

(2:53:06) i'm like there's a certain level of like social functional performativity that you should engage in where you like

(2:53:11) don't thrust your taboos on other people so like the leather walking I think is essentially thrusting your taboos onto

(2:53:17) other people that are not a What about homosexuality uh uh yeah I basically think that that's uh a taboo that I'm

(2:53:24) glad that we've reduced to not being a taboo yeah oh so you are so public display of homosexuality is not

(2:53:32) something but the dog walking thing is something you want to crack down on but the p like uh pride parades uh active

(2:53:39) simulated sexuality on on uh on the back of trucks that's good nope that's not

(2:53:45) what I said when you said homosexuality and I was picturing like gay men walking down the street holding hands and stuff like that like I think that's fine under

(2:53:52) a Christian view yep really yeah if if they're like secular people yeah why would I tell them that they can't do

(2:53:57) that well I didn't say they can't do it i'm saying Well you're basically saying that I should find a structure by which

(2:54:02) I enforce that gay man well I'm trying to find the threshold at which you um

(2:54:07) you use the bulldozer to clean the streets you said the the [ __ ] in the streets is a no no yep right mhm uh how

(2:54:14) about wearing like a dildo on your head um again if you're in like certain

(2:54:20) public spaces where everyone's consenting to that I don't care like say you go to like a gay bar and that's like a fun No no out in the street where kids

(2:54:26) are um yeah like I don't think most parents are consenting to their kids

(2:54:32) like seeing that so you probably shouldn't do that okay but the thing is have you ever seen a gay pride parade

(2:54:37) yep do you think that I support everything that happens at gay pride parades i didn't say that i said is

(2:54:42) there a is there something that you'd seen at a gay pride parade that you would use force to remove um use force

(2:54:50) to remove no I would use like social pressure oh so now pressure does work before you were like well we can't

(2:54:56) really shame yeah shame that's social pressure no social pressure can be like more than that right shame isn't the

() 

(2:55:01) only method by which you I'm interested what else i want all I want all tools of social pressure to be uh you can use

(2:55:07) guilt systems that's sh that's shame shame and guilt are functionally very different especially at a psychological

(2:55:13) level and like affecting change of behavior you can also use uh like positive reinforcement structures to

(2:55:19) make certain behaviors like more likely to occur so like tax writeoffs for EV is a way that you socially coers people to

(2:55:26) do EV etc etc how do you use social pressure to get two lisping dudes in

(2:55:33) their thongs in public to not do that uh you I think you can use some level of

(2:55:39) conversation around like consent like essentially uh it's probably not super appropriate in a public space where there are children to like thrust your

(2:55:45) sexual taboo onto children who don't understand it can't consent it and the parents are probably not consenting to it so you would would you walk up to

(2:55:52) that person and say that or I'd probably talk to the organizer of the Pride Parade because they're the ones like allowing it right right how do you think

(2:55:59) that would go i don't know probably some Probably not so good huh yeah some would be like "Thanks for your opinion." Yeah

(2:56:06) but that that's just like not what we're debating about like Yeah yeah there's lots of queer people that are [ __ ] [ __ ] true

(2:56:13) we are going to do little chats here we're going to probably wind down momentarily so if you want get them in we've reduced the TTS if you want we'll

(2:58:07) protecting like community even though they're not legally obligated to right we have your friend here Intel intel

(2:58:15) Wild donated $69 jim Bob hitting the gym is definitely making your shoulders look

(2:58:22) bigger you totally wrecked this 34 to the Orbiter tonight okay w Jim Bob thank

(2:58:28) you slowly but surely thank you Intel good to see you in the show got to say his lowest donation so far has been not

(2:58:35) talking about me but glazing you guys interesting interesting what are you trying to say about Intel

(2:58:41) saying that Intel Wild spending money to talk to me there you go okay got Jason

(2:58:48) here thank you Jason jason Castle donated $69 nature's concept of master morality

(2:58:54) supports my view of tactics the noble tactician applies force intelligently unashamedly shaping the battlefield not

(2:59:02) dodging power with moral excuses he's got a followup coming in here in just a moment that was a crazy statement

(2:59:10) jason Cassell literally went to chat GBT and rolled his forehead on it and said "Nech." Jason Castle donated

(2:59:16) $69 also I find it funny that you claim to be a Christian but you reference

(2:59:23) ner states Christianity as the one great curse i also cited Haidiger who's a Nazi

(2:59:29) do you think that that means that I also am a Nazi like yes you can cite people who disagree with multiple things that

(2:59:36) also have good criticisms of other systems like what a non-statement so guys if you want to get a message in

(2:59:42) $69 TTS also I just wanted to pull this one back up just to give you an example of what I'm talking about so the way

(2:59:47) that you know if some typically I mean I guess you can custom in if you're on desktop you can customize an input to

(2:59:54) make it $99.99 if it's ending in 99 typically that means they've done it through the

(2:59:59) YouTube app so if you're using uh Apple iOS you're using a YouTube app either on

(3:00:05) an iPhone iPad whatever whatever device it is yeah so Apple's going to take 30

(3:00:11) then YouTube's going to take 30 so that it leaves the creator with uh

(3:00:16) $49 so basically the math on it is 100 time 0.7* 0.7 that's what the creator is

(3:00:22) left with so still super appreciative of the super chat but just just be aware when you're sending these in if you are

(3:00:28) trying to be a patron of the show zoe's a bad girl it's terrible zoe yeah Apple takes their 30% then YouTube takes their

(3:00:36) 30% $69 TTS also if you guys speaking of actually Venmo Cash App we get 100% of

(3:00:42) your contribution so these platforms won't take their cut john thank you for the $2 on Cash App appreciate that and

(3:00:48) it is a $69 TTS if you guys want to get it in uh you know what uh unless you

(3:00:54) guys wanted to do a bit more open conversation I think we can just go into the closing statements unless you guys

(3:00:59) want to cover anything else we can do that okay cool you've been here for 18 hours yep uh so uh Kyla you get to uh

(3:01:06) close first why don't you go don't I close last cuz I went second cuz he got

(3:01:11) the first word so I got the last word right or wait hold on yeah cuz last time I got Is that how it works yeah it

(3:01:17) probably should be cuz usually starting first is the strongest and ending last is like the strongest you balance those two things

(3:01:23) isn't it like first goes last I went first is that how it goes but then

(3:01:28) you're getting the strongest starting and the strongest ending which doesn't make a lot of sense right i thought it was like recency effect i think

(3:01:35) affirming isn't the strongest cuz you're in the No when I say when I say

(3:01:40) strongest I mean like to the viewer there's recency effect and then there's like um um initiation effect or whatever

(3:01:46) it's called where's the I don't care i thought whoever whoever goes first goes first for the close but uh that would

(3:01:53) mean that he goes first for the close and then I end it sorry wait I misspoke whoever goes first for the for the open

(3:02:01) goes second for the close am I just Whatever you want to do

(3:02:07) boss it's your show you know what we're going to have you You know what no Kyla

() 

(3:02:13) gets last words bob go ahead you go first um yeah so the debate uh there

(3:02:18) wasn't a clear prompt it wasn't exactly the same as her previous debate uh essentially we're looking at what

(3:02:24) feminism is what feminism isn't i think the key thing to take away tonight um

(3:02:29) from this debate conversation was that when you ask someone like Kyla is there

(3:02:36) a is there a standard for what constitutes feminism and the answer is no there really isn't a a position you

(3:02:46) can take to say this feminism thing is good for society it's just a set of preferences that you're calling feminism

(3:02:53) that a stance that's totally antithetical to those to those that criteria could also claim feminism so in

(3:03:00) other words I can claim feminism true feminism the real feminism is actually a

(3:03:05) Christian ethical system uh a Christian duty-based system that puts the wife and

(3:03:11) the mother primarily at home raising the children that's good for society and the men being the provider and the protector

(3:03:18) and that the world itself or the the the country itself is reflective of that i would argue that that's actually

(3:03:24) reflective of the church it church itself if you call yourself a Christian it's not only hierarchical but it's

(3:03:30) patriarchal um I think ultimately feminism no matter how you cut it the

(3:03:36) moment you apply it to society you're affirming the patriarchal role you're

(3:03:42) actually saying women should have xyz and it's a request and a grievance and

(3:03:47) you're making the grievance to a collective body of mostly men that are going to say yes or no to it it's an

(3:03:54) allowance it's like the child in the room asking uh can he can he finally come downstairs and play and the the

(3:04:01) leader of the house is saying maybe uh they can go back on it any time for instance you can give women the right to

(3:04:08) vote and you could also take it away so it's not something uh uh that that can't

(3:04:13) be altered by men ultimately at any given point and so that points to a

(3:04:19) major distinction between men and women uh ontologically their natures are different they're driven towards

(3:04:24) different things and I I think a society that acknowledges the difference between men and women is actually a society

(3:04:31) that's better and more accurately describing reality feminism doesn't describe reality

(3:04:38) accurately it actually argues with nature itself it argues with descriptive reality and says can we change

(3:04:44) descriptive reality and ultimately the answer is no um and then finally uh

(3:04:50) which is uh the killer uh any any worldview that's uh counter to

(3:04:56) Christianity is going to have a massive problem with this particular category of

(3:05:02) attack duties and obligations duties and obligations uh no matter how someone

(3:05:09) presents how eloquent how complex they present their worldview when we ask a simple question do you have any duty to

(3:05:16) XYZ do we have any are there any duties or obligations at all why should we

(3:05:21) follow this principle why should we do any of this they don't have an answer uh they don't have an answer to this

(3:05:26) question they could make one up but it's a set of preferences and so they're back to square one okay someone else comes

(3:05:33) along with greater force and they're going to they're going to implement their set of preferences and you really can't say [ __ ] especially as a woman and

(3:05:40) so um feminism is a massive lie we didn't even get into the history of it

(3:05:45) um its beginnings and uh it continues to be a lie and I think uh more and more

(3:05:51) women are waking up to the fact that maybe they don't maybe they shouldn't uh spend their most fertile years chasing a

(3:05:59) name tag and a lanyard uh acquiring debt uh acquiring rosters and uh and a long

(3:06:07) list of uh body counts maybe the best thing for women maybe the best thing for

(3:06:14) women maybe the most feminist approach you could possibly take for women is to

(3:06:19) be servants of the home servants of God servants to their children and their husband

(3:06:26) all right thank you Jim Bob and then Kylo give us your closing statement please sure so um I'm not sure why but

(3:06:33) Jim Bob kind of did this interesting equivocation where he uh talks about duties and obligations and compares it

(3:06:40) to things like where you're compelled to do what you're required to do and there's consequences for not and he's

(3:06:47) muddying that with another concept which would be like ought statements or prescriptions right and these are not

(3:06:52) the same thing right there are certain behaviors that you're barred from doing but that doesn't mean that there's other behaviors that you must do necessarily

(3:06:59) and so when he's talking about like obligations from feminism he's saying that it doesn't have obligations but but

(3:07:04) it does if by obligations you mean values and principles about how one should act right this idea as well that

(3:07:11) like feminism doesn't have this like any level of like internal sophistication to create an internalized definition is is

(3:07:18) essentially flying in the face of how basically all of philosophy works right this idea that feminism doesn't have a

(3:07:25) uniting front isn't really true nobody would really agree that somebody who like wants to put women in dungeons and

(3:07:31) give them no rights is a feminist right and even if that person said that they were a feminist it wouldn't be a live

(3:07:37) idea because at the zeitgeist level society we've broadly agreed that feminism has certain precepts that we

(3:07:43) agree to but it's it's it's a non-institutional ide ideology and so if

(3:07:49) if religion Christianity an institution that has pretty strict bridged standards

(3:07:54) by what you should and shouldn't believe can have so many interpretations and heterogeneity and how it expresses and

(3:08:00) what oughts they think you must do feminism is just similar in that it's an idea but it's it's even more devoid of

(3:08:07) an institutional like structure but just because it lacks an institutional structure doesn't make it just like this

(3:08:13) defunct idea this is obviously true right if feminism wasn't really real

(3:08:18) then Jim Bob wouldn't have an issue with it if it didn't have some level of like pressing cohesion to it then Jim Bob

(3:08:23) wouldn't see it as like a satanic thing of history right it's obviously something even though the lines between

(3:08:29) what is and isn't feminism can be argued about how to define it we don't have

(3:08:34) standards for things like kindness precisely we talk about it there's generally an orientation towards what we

(3:08:40) think looks and feels like kindness but that doesn't mean that there's like institutional standards by which we call

(3:08:46) this is kindness and this is not it's it's a very much a a dialogue which is what feminism is and I think that's part

(3:08:52) of what makes feminism cool right is that's this idea that most people can self- select into and engage with and

(3:08:58) kind of make it their own but there's obviously going to be people that are co-opting the label that don't have any

(3:09:04) orientations that broadly would be towards feminism um just want to speak very briefly on debt probably important

(3:09:11) to point out that probably the worst thing that has happened to with like David Ramsey and Boomer is to make you

(3:09:18) think that debt is scary inherently it's not scary inherently in fact the richest people on the planet have massive

(3:09:25) amounts of debt what's a problem with debt is unmanaged debt and having a a

(3:09:30) debt that is inflating and interest growing that is larger than your income right debt that gets away from you but

(3:09:36) debt is one of the principles by which makes inflation uh fungeible because it

(3:09:41) essentially decreases value over time so anyone doing this like ugabooga about debt doesn't know really what they're

(3:09:48) talking about jim Bob is a really classic example of somebody who talks a lot really confidently about things but

(3:09:53) doesn't really know what the [ __ ] he's talking about the last time him and I had a debate we talked about GDP and in the middle of the debate it got revealed

(3:09:59) that he doesn't know what GDP is and he doesn't know why it even matters for a military which if you don't know to have

(3:10:05) a military you have to have a competitive enough GDP that you can fund it so that neighboring countries don't

(3:10:10) [ __ ] stop you that's why GDP matters right in the case of when we're talking about governance and obligations he

(3:10:16) doesn't even know what the three branches are government are and so it's like you should probably be cautious when listening to somebody when they're

(3:10:22) speaking about governance or they're speaking about debt or they're speaking about the ways that we in which we should organize ourselves when they

(3:10:27) don't even know like the basic precepts under which they live right should probably know what the legislative branch is and what it does if you want

(3:10:34) to talk in any way about like civil rights and obligations that we might have you should probably understand what the executive branch does and the

(3:10:40) judicial branch if you want to cite the Supreme Court for your argument it's probably important to do these things

(3:10:45) finally when we're talking about things like force versus freedom these are tensions that go against each other

(3:10:51) force is something that we need you need a military to stomp the bad guys you need to be able to like protect your

(3:10:57) sovereignty that's valuable but we don't live for force we survive by force and

(3:11:02) we live for freedoms that's what we like thrive and flourish with and feminism is much more preoccupied with the

(3:11:09) flourishing piece what are pieces that we can give to women to help them flourish more and you might disagree you

(3:11:15) might not like the idea that feeling that women need to flourish anymore and that's totally fine right but feminism

(3:11:22) doesn't have to solve security it's not aiming to it's not a commentary on security in any ways and so when you

(3:11:28) conflate these things arbitrarily all you're doing is making a false dichotomy because these two things have nothing to

(3:11:34) do with one another um if you want to like show up to debates you should probably know how your government works

(3:11:39) you should probably understand how fallacies work and you should probably understand how like economy basically

(3:11:44) works if you want to talk about any of these things in in an informed way

(3:11:49) okay thank you guys for your closing statements we do have some chats that are going to come through though here

(3:11:55) towards the end uh oh speaking of which we're going to do a little a brief roast session $20 TTS if you want to get a

(3:24:10) John Milbank [ __ ] it's not orthodoxy it's not Protestantism it's just heresy

(3:24:16) you give Christians a bad name s husband w Jim Bob wj Dw whatever thank you man i

(3:24:24) don't know if somebody can be a s if they're having sex with I have a really quick question about that do you are you

(3:24:30) firm enough in what you call orthodox Protestantism where you debate that against another theological in general i

(3:24:37) think I think talking about religion from a theological standpoint that puts any onus spiritual leadership on you is

(3:24:44) extremely is something that you should do with extreme caution um and I'm not a spiritual leader i'm not like a pastor

(3:24:51) and I'm not ordained to so I more or less usually won't because I think

(3:24:56) Yeah i just think it's dangerous it's it's a theological conclusion that I've arrived at but I would never be so Is

(3:25:02) there like a main apologist who does though that you know of um there's a few

(3:25:08) there's probably not one that I could like name off the top of my head right now but there there's a few it's started I think in like I think the 50s yeah i

(3:25:14) just want to see if there's anyone so we can organize this destruction okay okay

(3:25:20) got donated $20 jim Bob Andrew Rachel

(3:25:26) and sometimes Brian argue calmly and coherently not so erodite gets

(3:25:31) frustrated when she thinks she can't win an argument in fact a valid argument is

(3:25:36) not about winning thank you for that Pasty George thank you appreciate the message got Hartus

(3:25:42) thank you donated $20 erodite if men have all of the force why the heck

(3:25:48) should we even listen to what weak feminists have to say what's the ought uh because might doesn't make right and

(3:25:55) you should care about people for more than just whether or not they can beat you up to force you to listen to them like obviously we're not barbarians guys

(3:26:01) well let me just push back really quick if the men listened to you they and and they applied your policy then might

(3:26:09) would actually make right in that instance because it would require some force to give you your advantageous

(3:26:15) policy i don't think like respecting women or like uh allowing them to like make choices for their own is like

(3:26:20) something that you need to use for So just just so we're clear might is right when it affirms feminism no I've never

(3:26:27) said that might makes right is might correct when it defends feminism

(3:26:33) uh sometimes there there's a lot of feminist policies that's really So you do so you do need might it's not

(3:26:39) entirely I mean I need the authority of the government again we can like go down this diet tribe but again for your

(3:26:45) muscles nope okay all right well I think uh that's it if there's any that come through here just in these final seconds
