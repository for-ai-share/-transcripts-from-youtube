Title: Wilson Vs 5: Rights Donâ€™t Actually Exist, Only Force | DEBATE

(0:00) You're practicing your own form of

(0:01) Sharia law. It's your own form of Sharia

(0:04) law. I made up a bunch of values.

(0:06) I appeal to them and I'll use force to

(0:08) uphold them.

(0:09) Why is that a bad thing?

(0:10) To uphold them. I'm not the one who

(0:11) makes a claim Sharia law is bad. That

(0:13) would be atheist, right?

(0:15) I don't appeal to a book that's 1500

(0:17) years old. I appeal to logic and reason.

(0:19) You appeal to a document that's 200

(0:20) years old.

(0:21) No, I don't. Which what document?

(0:22) The Constitution.

(0:23) I don't I don't appeal to the

(0:25) Constitution.

(0:25) So then you don't think you have a right

(0:27) to to speech? It's all arbitrary though,

(0:29) I think, whether it's coming from a

(0:30) Christian side or

(0:31) so. If it's all arbitrary, right, then

(0:33) why can't I get a bunch of men together

(0:34) with machine guns to go and enforce my

(0:36) ethics, if you can get a bunch of men

(0:38) with machine guns to come enforce my

(0:40) rights?

(0:40) I mean, again, I agree with you. We

(0:42) could do that. I think we would agree

(0:43) that's probably not the best way to

(0:45) handle

(0:45) I'm not sure that I would agree that

(0:47) it's not the best way to handle it.

(0:49) [Music]

(0:55) My name is Andrew Wilson, host of The

(0:56) Crucible, popular entertainment channel

(0:58) on YouTube. Um, and today I'm going to

(1:01) be debating five different people on

(1:03) five different topics for 5 minutes. My

(1:06) next topic is rights don't actually

(1:08) exist, only force.

(1:13) All right. So, rights don't exist. Um,

(1:16) that's correct.

(1:17) Do you mind elaborating for me? Just

(1:18) what you mean? Well, can you taste a

(1:20) right, touch it, smell it?

(1:22) No. No.

(1:22) So, these are just conceptual

(1:27) possibly. Yeah.

(1:27) Yeah. So, then they don't exist.

(1:30) Should we not act as if they do though?

(1:32) That's not the question though. That's

(1:33) fair. We can move to to that. I'm fine

(1:35) with that. But we need to establish they

(1:38) don't exist, right?

(1:39) Um I'm tempted to agree with you

(1:41) upfront. Yeah, they probably don't. So

(1:42) anytime you say that a person has a

(1:44) right or human right or this type of

(1:46) right, what you're really saying is that

(1:49) there should be some type of force

(1:51) doctrine which is applied in maintaining

(1:54) that a person can and always will be

(1:55) allowed to do X.

(1:59) Okay. So sorry, I'm I just want to

(2:02) understand your position better. So I

(2:03) want to pivot a little bit. Like you're

(2:05) you're Christian if I understand. So

(2:08) aren't rights kind of fundamental to

(2:10) your belief or do you No.

(2:11) No. Okay.

(2:12) Now, duties are so to me a right is um

(2:17) it's an entitlement absent a duty.

(2:20) Okay.

(2:20) That's what I would consider a right to

(2:22) be. So like you have a right to vote,

(2:23) right?

(2:24) Yes.

(2:24) Do you have to vote?

(2:25) No.

(2:26) Okay. You have a right to own a gun,

(2:27) right?

(2:27) But do you have to own a gun? Right.

(2:29) You have a right to speech, but do you

(2:30) have to? Right.

(2:31) So there's no duties with these

(2:33) entitlements, right?

(2:34) Okay.

(2:35) Since there's no duties with these

(2:36) entitlements, there's entitlements

(2:38) period. Mhm.

(2:39) But what you're really saying when you

(2:40) grant a right or when you say my rights,

(2:42) you're talking about force because it's

(2:44) always going to reduce to force

(2:47) upholding a right no matter what. So

(2:50) basically everything inside of a society

(2:52) which is secular, right? It's just

(2:54) really we're just always talking about

(2:56) force.

(2:57) So you think that duties are objective

(3:00) in some sense though? I guess I'm trying

(3:02) to I am genuinely a little confused by

(3:04) where we're going with this.

(3:05) Yeah. Just saying that a right, right,

(3:07) is an entitlement absent of duty.

(3:09) Okay.

(3:09) It just means that the we're not telling

(3:11) you you have to do something. We're just

(3:13) giving something to you instead.

(3:16) Okay.

(3:17) Yeah. So, what I'm saying is that

(3:19) because this is the case, right? What

(3:22) really it comes down to in a secular

(3:24) nation is force. What we're arguing

(3:26) about fundamentally is force. So I think

(3:29) secularists, right, when they're talking

(3:31) about rights, they want Christians to

(3:34) enforce their rights. They're actually

(3:36) asking us and requesting that we use

(3:38) force on their behalf.

(3:41) H

(3:44) So how I guess paint this picture for me

(3:46) in a Christian nation, I'm I'm assuming

(3:49) you're proposing this to criticize

(3:51) secular nations.

(3:52) Do women's do women have the right to an

(3:53) abortion?

(3:55) Maybe not in the objective sense, but I

(3:56) would say yes.

(3:57) Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, in the this

(3:58) constructed sense of rights, a woman

(4:00) should be allowed to get an abortion,

(4:02) right?

(4:02) Yes.

(4:03) What if Christians try to stop her?

(4:07) I mean, I think that's wrong.

(4:08) Yeah. But they don't think she has that

(4:09) right,

(4:10) right?

(4:11) That entitlement, right? So, it's just

(4:13) reduces to force. So, really what

(4:14) secularists are saying is like we will

(4:16) use force against you, against your

(4:18) beliefs,

(4:19) right? Or if there's a draft, like let's

(4:22) say they draft Christians, right? Same

(4:24) thing. They want they want Christians to

(4:25) utilize force on their behalf. Rights

(4:28) themselves just come down to the idea of

(4:29) force.

(4:30) I I guess I'm just trying to figure out

(4:32) because we are tight on time like what

(4:34) the I guess the point we're getting at

(4:36) is because I don't see how this would

(4:37) that you don't have any rights.

(4:39) So when you say my rights, right, the

(4:41) Christians are trying to attack my

(4:43) rights. That's all fictitious

(4:45) imagination nonsense.

(4:47) But does that stop being fictitious if

(4:49) we operate under a Christian framework?

(4:51) Like I'm just I'm not I I agree with you

(4:52) that rights are arbitrary in some sense.

(4:55) Completely fictitious and made up.

(4:56) And if that's the ultimate point if

(4:58) there's no

(4:58) So if it is the case that I'm supposed

(4:59) to enforce your rights because you use

(5:01) force, why can't I enforce you

(5:02) Christianity using force?

(5:04) Well, I don't think you can enforce

(5:05) someone to believe something. That's I I

(5:07) don't

(5:08) Yeah, but Christian ethics. Why couldn't

(5:09) I use Christian ethics and use force to

(5:12) enforce Christian ethics if you can use

(5:13) force to enforce my rights?

(5:15) Well, you you can, but we have to have a

(5:18) conversation about whether or not that's

(5:19) the right thing to do. It's all

(5:20) arbitrary though, I think, whether it's

(5:21) coming from a Christian side or

(5:23) so. If it's all arbitrary, right, then

(5:24) why can't I get a bunch of men together

(5:26) with machine guns to go and enforce my

(5:28) ethics, if you can get a bunch of men

(5:30) with machine guns to come enforce my

(5:31) rights?

(5:32) I mean, again, I agree with you. We

(5:34) could do that. I think we would agree

(5:35) that's probably not the best way to

(5:36) handle

(5:37) I'm not sure that I would agree that

(5:38) it's not the best way to handle it. I

(5:40) think that

(5:40) that's a shame with 30 seconds left.

(5:42) Yeah. I think that if there's a pushing

(5:44) that if there is a pushing for force to

(5:46) in order to uphold things that you can

(5:48) social constructs in your mind that you

(5:51) think should be upheld via force, then

(5:53) even if Christianity is a lie, why

(5:55) shouldn't we do the same damn thing?

(5:58) Yeah, I'm not going to be able to answer

(6:00) that for 15 seconds, but that that's

(6:01) that's a good one. I appreciate it, man.

(6:03) I appreciate it.

(6:06) Hello, sir.

(6:06) Hey, how are you? Good.

(6:10) So um can you elaborate on the rights

(6:13) don't exist uh they are enforced?

(6:15) Yeah. The idea here is that if a right

(6:18) is an entitlement absent of duty that

(6:20) force will be employed on behalf of

(6:23) upholding this completely social

(6:26) construct nonsense doesn't exist thing

(6:29) right and you can appeal to this social

(6:31) construct doesn't exist nonsense thing

(6:33) in order to utilize force then I can do

(6:36) the exact same thing even if you think

(6:38) Christianity is a lie.

(6:43) All right I got to concede real quick.

(6:46) I'm so sorry. I This is way above me.

(6:49) This this this state this topic right

(6:51) here. All right. I'm sorry. Thank you.

(6:53) No problem.

(6:56) Not again.

(6:57) Hello.

(6:59) All right. So, you think I I we

(7:02) completely we completely agree about the

(7:04) fact that rights don't exist uh and it's

(7:07) only force, but I have a strong feeling

(7:09) that your the next step in your

(7:10) conclusion why you're saying this we

(7:12) would disagree on. So what what is the

(7:14) what is the the point of that?

(7:16) Okay, you agree with me that a right is

(7:18) a social construct that doesn't exist in

(7:20) objective reality that is completely

(7:21) made up nonsense, right?

(7:23) Yes.

(7:23) Can you appeal to it and use force?

(7:26) In what do you mean? And what

(7:28) if somebody is obstructing your right to

(7:31) do X thing,

(7:32) right? Does that give you now something

(7:36) to appeal to in order to have force used

(7:38) to enforce that right?

(7:40) Yeah.

(7:40) Okay. Okay. So, you made some

(7:42) up and then said, "Well, if you cross

(7:45) this threshold for this, we're going to

(7:46) use force against you." So, if it is the

(7:49) case,

(7:49) civilization works.

(7:50) Yeah. So, if it is the case, hang on.

(7:52) So, if it is the case that Christianity

(7:53) is false, who cares?

(7:55) I'm going to appeal to it and use force.

(7:58) What's the problem?

(7:59) I mean, from from the perspective of

(8:01) rights, nothing.

(8:02) Yeah. From the Well, from the

(8:03) perspective of anybody, nothing. You're

(8:05) doing the same. So from the perspective

(8:06) of truth that you don't have anything to

(8:09) base what you're saying on.

(8:10) No, you actually you're at the same

(8:12) problem, right? This thing that you're

(8:15) appealing to is

(8:16) I'm very open about the fact that I

(8:17) don't know the thing you're appealing to

(8:18) is

(8:18) you're the one saying you have

(8:19) Yeah. The thing that you're appealing to

(8:21) isn't true.

(8:22) I same. I agree. So if the thing that

(8:25) you're appealing to

(8:26) isn't true. Yeah. So So if that is the

(8:28) case, then like I said, it really is

(8:30) just reducing to force. The arbitrary

(8:32) thing that we just made up, I get to use

(8:34) force. So why are we sitting here

(8:35) discussing instead of fighting?

(8:37) Because right now the ability to use

(8:39) forces on your side.

(8:41) How so?

(8:42) Because the mites that you would appeal

(8:45) to are enforced via the law of the land.

(8:47) And so the force doctrine right now the

(8:50) appeals on your side. So the system

(8:52) which we would have to work within is

(8:53) dialogue based. Right.

(8:55) Yeah.

(8:56) Yeah. But if it was reversed, right, you

(8:58) would be in the same exact uh you'd have

(9:01) the same exact problem. We would appeal

(9:02) to this thing. you consider to be

(9:04) fictitious. The force is now on our

(9:07) side. We could just oh, I don't know,

(9:10) say, "Well, you can't talk at all

(9:12) because we got all the force."

(9:13) You could, but but I I don't I don't see

(9:15) where that gets us. Yeah, you could. If

(9:17) you have the might, then you could do

(9:18) whatever you want

(9:19) because there's no way because there's

(9:21) no way in your view for you to say that

(9:23) that's in any way, shape, or form

(9:25) problematic because it's the same thing

(9:26) you're doing,

(9:28) right?

(9:28) Yeah. So if Christians take over, right,

(9:31) take over the entire country, utilize

(9:33) force doctrine, and then say you can

(9:36) never talk again.

(9:37) Yeah. And say you can never talk again.

(9:39) If they did, I'm saying if they did,

(9:41) right, and say you can never speak again

(9:42) on this topic, you can't actually tell

(9:45) me why that's in any way wrong

(9:47) cuz it's the same thing you do,

(9:49) right? But we we uh uh we have these

(9:51) these social constructs and then we

(9:53) adhere to them. We can have the

(9:55) conversation that it would be wrong for

(9:56) us to punch each other here because we

(9:58) are here for a debate where we have

(10:00) established that we want to talk about

(10:01) things.

(10:04) Exactly. So what I'm saying if you're

(10:07) appealing to if you decided that you

(10:08) actually didn't want to do that and you

(10:10) did want to punch me, there's nothing I

(10:11) could do to stop you. So

(10:13) no, there is. You could use force. I

(10:15) mean I'm a little dude

(10:18) but the point but the point is is like

(10:19) you can use force whether you're a

(10:21) little dude or big dude or

(10:22) but I'm saying outside of that I agree

(10:24) with you there is no outside I'm not

(10:27) right I I agree with you that's not

(10:28) understanding why this is a

(10:29) because what I'm saying is that for when

(10:31) atheists say Christians shouldn't be in

(10:33) power because of my rights what they're

(10:36) really saying is

(10:37) Christians shouldn't be in power because

(10:39) we will use force for this arbitrary

(10:41) madeup that that we like that

(10:44) and we don't want them to do anything

(10:45) about it. So

(10:47) if that is the case, then in the

(10:48) reverse, we can appeal to the same

(10:49) thing,

(10:50) right? And so that's exactly the same

(10:52) thing that you're appealing to with the

(10:54) rest of the Western secular world when

(10:56) it comes to Sharia law that well, we

(10:58) have these things that we believe and we

(11:00) like.

(11:00) And we don't want you to come and use

(11:02) force,

(11:02) but you can't tell them why that's bad

(11:04) because you're doing the same thing.

(11:10) Again, I agree with you. In fact, what

(11:11) I'm saying is that you're you're

(11:13) practicing your own form of Sharia law.

(11:16) It's your own form of Sharia law. I made

(11:18) up a bunch of values.

(11:20) I appeal to them and I'll use force to

(11:22) uphold them.

(11:22) Why is that a bad thing?

(11:23) To uphold them. I'm not the one who

(11:24) makes the claim Sharia law is bad. That

(11:27) would be atheist, right?

(11:28) I mean, yeah, but that's spec not

(11:30) because of the for not because of the

(11:32) fact that it's force and and rights are

(11:34) conceptual, because of what the actual

(11:37) tenants of it are. Do you

(11:39) What do you mean? You disagree with

(11:41) Don't you think all the tenants are made

(11:42) up?

(11:43) Yes.

(11:43) Then you're doing then it's the same

(11:44) thing.

(11:45) Okay. But I if I made up that Spider-Man

(11:47) has uh uh the best suit is yellow. I

(11:50) still made that you could agree or

(11:51) disagree with that.

(11:52) So what?

(11:53) So they made up a thing. You made up a

(11:54) thing. I made up a thing and we could

(11:56) all

(11:56) So it all reduces to force. Yeah.

(11:58) So you have no leg to stand on to tell

(12:00) people who have have Sharia law that

(12:01) it's bad.

(12:02) I think I think we agreed too much on

(12:03) this. I don't know why we're fighting.

(12:08) Andrew. Hey. to see you again.

(12:10) You You too. It's been a long time.

(12:13) Yeah,

(12:14) it's been about 20 20 minutes.

(12:15) Yeah.

(12:16) So,

(12:17) I missed you.

(12:17) Yes. Likewise.

(12:21) We might agree too much on this topic,

(12:22) but I think that's okay. We don't have

(12:24) to disagree on everything, right? So, I

(12:27) think, correct me if I'm wrong, your

(12:28) position is people are not entitled to

(12:31) other people's services. Would you

(12:33) agree?

(12:33) No,

(12:34) that's not what I'm saying.

(12:35) Okay. So, elaborate on what you're

(12:37) saying. I'm saying that anything from

(12:38) the from the atheist worldview, anything

(12:42) right that's outside of complete natural

(12:44) mechanisms is arbitrary and made up and

(12:46) non-objective

(12:48) including their belief in or their

(12:51) belief that Christianity is completely

(12:53) made up or Islam is completely made up.

(12:55) They think all these things are

(12:56) completely made up. The problem is is

(12:58) that the things that they appeal to

(13:00) human rights, human dignity, you right,

(13:03) that's all completely made up too from

(13:05) their view. So if it's the case that

(13:07) they'll defend those things with force,

(13:09) what leg do they have to stand on to say

(13:11) that Muslims or Christians can't defend

(13:13) their values also with force?

(13:17) Defend their values with force. So, so

(13:19) wait, so you think that it's okay to

(13:24) bomb a church because that's their va

(13:28) values is that they think

(13:29) what I'm saying is that if it is the

(13:31) case that the only thing you're

(13:33) appealing to is something which is made

(13:35) up and saying we made it up but we

(13:37) really like it so we use force to defend

(13:39) it then you can't really go out to to

(13:42) after a religion that you think is made

(13:44) up who appeals to this madeup thing

(13:46) and uses force because it's the same

(13:48) thing you're doing.

(13:50) No, but that is the doctrine of Islam

(13:53) and Christianity and previously is to

(13:56) enforce your religious beliefs by force.

(13:58) That's the doctrine of the atheist.

(14:00) Atheis Atheism doesn't have a doctrine.

(14:03) Atheism is beliefless, right? So we just

(14:06) So then what do you appeal to?

(14:07) I just reject your Santa Claus.

(14:10) So then what do you appeal to for the

(14:12) use of force?

(14:13) Well, at the end of every rule and law

(14:16) is a gun,

(14:17) right? Yeah. So what are you but what do

(14:18) you appeal to? You appeal to say

(14:20) anything.

(14:20) Do you appeal you don't appeal to

(14:21) rights?

(14:22) Logic and reason.

(14:23) Logic and reason.

(14:23) Yeah.

(14:24) Are those objectively true?

(14:26) What is We can get into an hourong

(14:28) discussion about objective truth. But do

(14:30) I I don't appeal to a book that's 1500

(14:33) years old. I appeal to logic and reason.

(14:35) You appeal to a document that's 200

(14:36) years old.

(14:37) No, I don't. What document?

(14:38) The Constitution.

(14:39) I don't I don't appeal to the

(14:41) Constitution.

(14:41) So then you don't think you have a right

(14:42) to to speech?

(14:46) We have do we have a right to speech?

(14:48) That's a good question. Sure. In this

(14:50) country, we do. Of course, because it's

(14:52) written into law. But

(14:55) but that law is fictitious, right? The

(14:58) actual right is fictitious.

(15:00) I agree.

(15:00) But you will use force, right, to

(15:02) protect that right.

(15:05) That right is enforced by

(15:07) force. But it's made up.

(15:08) At the end of the day, a gun.

(15:09) Yeah. And but it's made up, right? Yes.

(15:11) So then if these guys really if my rel

(15:13) let's just say my religion is false.

(15:14) Yeah. What leg do any does anybody have

(15:16) to stand on to say that we can't uphold

(15:18) it with force?

(15:21) I think because religion wasn't voted

(15:23) into law by the population.

(15:26) So,

(15:26) so, so, so your doctrine, your religious

(15:28) doctrine.

(15:29) Yeah.

(15:29) No one voted on that.

(15:31) So, so why should the population be held

(15:33) accountable?

(15:34) Voting. Voting

(15:35) that's a democracy.

(15:36) It's just a construct too.

(15:37) No, no. Democracy, right? So why should

(15:41) so no one voted on the Christian

(15:43) doctrine or the Islamic

(15:45) democracy is a madeup nonsensical

(15:48) construct as well?

(15:49) Not nonsensical.

(15:50) It's made up. Right?

(15:52) If you want to go down that route,

(15:53) everything is made up.

(15:54) Right? So if everything is made up and

(15:56) everything is fake and everything is

(15:58) false and everything is a social

(15:59) construct, including my religion,

(16:01) but you can use force to uphold your

(16:03) social construct.

(16:04) Social contract. We're atheism.

(16:06) What the hell is a social contract?

(16:08) No. No. Atheism is abs the absence of

(16:12) belief. So

(16:13) Oh, great. So things we don't believe

(16:15) in, we use force to uphold.

(16:17) No, like what?

(16:19) Whatever it is you use force to uphold

(16:20) if it's an absence of belief.

(16:23) Uh like again the first amendment.

(16:26) Go ahead.

(16:26) Right. Perhaps a third amendment,

(16:28) perhaps the fourth, perhaps the fifth.

(16:29) Well, elaborate.

(16:31) Would you use force or uh enable a

(16:33) government to use force in order to make

(16:35) sure people had due process? Due process

(16:38) is something that we put into place as a

(16:40) law because it was voted on by the

(16:42) people.

(16:43) Yeah. But it's still social

(16:44) doctrine is not voted on by the people.

(16:46) Let's say that people voted on it then

(16:48) that would be okay.

(16:48) Then it's fine.

(16:49) Yes.

(16:50) Even though it's not true.

(16:51) Correct.

(16:52) Yeah. But voting in democracy and the

(16:54) idea of democracy that's just an

(16:57) arbitrary social construct as well.

(16:58) So So you are you a communist?

(17:00) No. But what does that have to do with

(17:01) my point?

(17:02) Your point is is that no one voted on

(17:03) topics.

(17:04) Yes, I'm a communist. Is that also a

(17:07) madeup social construct?

(17:09) No, it's it's

(17:10) it's not.

(17:10) No, it's not.

(17:11) It's not. Okay. Why isn't it?

(17:14) The the term of course is made up. But

(17:16) the the

(17:18) Yeah. All right.

(17:18) Appreciate it, man.

(17:19) Thanks, man.

(17:20) Yeah. No problem.

(17:22) Greetings again, Andrew.

(17:24) Greetings again. We'll just do this this

(17:25) time.

(17:26) Understood.

(17:26) Yeah.

(17:27) Formalities.

(17:28) Lots of shaking hand. We don't have

(17:29) shake hands. I guess like every 10

(17:30) minutes, right?

(17:32) Becomes a little bit more awkward. So

(17:34) may you rephrase your question again?

(17:36) Yeah. So uh rights aren't real, right?

(17:39) All that exists is force

(17:42) then what what type of force would be

(17:45) acceptable

(17:47) for us to exist in? What's the need for

(17:51) force to begin with?

(17:53) It would be to uh push our will.

(17:57) Okay. Whose will as an individual?

(17:59) Whoever has the force.

(18:00) Okay. Whoever has the force. So if God

(18:02) has the force,

(18:03) Yeah. then he's going to be able to push

(18:04) his will.

(18:05) Sure.

(18:05) Okay. Now, would he be righteously

(18:07) justified? Let's just say depending on

(18:10) situational circumstance to push his

(18:12) will, but in a way that is actually

(18:14) acceptable. Let's say persuasion.

(18:16) Well, let's assume there's no God. Let's

(18:18) just assume it for a second for the sake

(18:20) of argument. There's no God, right?

(18:21) There is no God.

(18:22) What are you left with?

(18:24) Well, you have to start with yourself.

(18:26) You have to accept that you do you.

(18:28) Okay. So, I think, therefore, I am. So,

(18:29) you exist.

(18:30) Correct. Okay.

(18:31) But now there's

(18:32) but everything everything else that

(18:33) you're engaging in is that a product of

(18:35) the mind?

(18:37) It it plays a part. There's other

(18:40) factors that need to be accounted for

(18:42) other than the mind. I mean the mind is

(18:44) just one aspect.

(18:45) But when we're talking about rights,

(18:46) correct? Right.

(18:47) Are those a product of the mind?

(18:50) It's a it's a byproduct.

(18:52) If there's no God if there's no God

(18:54) if there's no God.

(18:55) Yeah. Are rights just a product of the

(18:56) mind?

(18:57) It's a byproduct. It's after the fact.

(19:02) It's Well, it's just a product of

(19:03) meaning you people just made them up.

(19:07) Well, they made it up for what variety

(19:09) of reasons?

(19:11) Yeah, but regardless of the of the

(19:13) reasons why.

(19:14) Okay. Right.

(19:14) Regardless,

(19:15) they made up our rights made up.

(19:19) Okay. Uh let's in the real world.

(19:22) Yeah.

(19:23) We have been given these rights because

(19:24) we

(19:25) like you have a right to own a gun,

(19:26) right?

(19:27) Uh,

(19:27) according to the constitution. Oh,

(19:29) according to the constitution.

(19:30) Yeah.

(19:30) We have a right to defend oursel

(19:32) to to own a gun.

(19:33) To own a gun. Yes.

(19:34) In the legal sense.

(19:35) But is that made up?

(19:37) Is that made up?

(19:40) It need to be tested. But

(19:42) Sure.

(19:43) Yeah. It's made up, right?

(19:44) It's made up.

(19:44) So then if somebody violates this made

(19:47) up right.

(19:47) Yes.

(19:48) Right. And you can use force to defend

(19:50) this madeup right.

(19:51) Yes.

(19:52) Then even if Christianity was made up,

(19:54) why couldn't you use force to defend it?

(19:57) Um

(20:00) well would it be righteously justified

(20:02) or unrighteously unjustified? So really

(20:04) we have to go to the actual fundamental

(20:06) foundation of existence.

(20:08) Yeah. But I'm talking from the view of

(20:09) the atheist.

(20:10) Well the view of the atheist.

(20:11) From the view of the atheist or the view

(20:12) of the secularist if rights don't

(20:14) actually exist but they can use force in

(20:18) order to uh defend them. Right. These

(20:21) things that they just literally admit

(20:23) are made up.

(20:24) Correct. If their criticism of you, the

(20:26) Christian, is that you have made up

(20:28) Christianity,

(20:29) who cares? You can still use force to um

(20:33) defend this madeup thing. Right.

(20:36) Correct.

(20:37) So, from their view, it's totally

(20:38) coherent, totally appropriate, and

(20:40) totally reasonable and rational for you

(20:44) to to have a completely madeup God and

(20:47) then use force to defend that. Well,

(20:52) it really goes back to the truth claim

(20:54) of who's actually in the right and who's

(20:57) actually in the wrong. Cuz just because

(20:59) you go on the right path doesn't mean

(21:01) I claim all atheism on all uh non

(21:05) theists.

(21:06) Yes.

(21:06) All of their worldviews will eventually

(21:08) reduce to the barrel of a gun.

(21:10) Agreed. Whether it be short-term, middle

(21:12) of the road, or even the long term, it

(21:14) cannot survive to totality.

(21:16) Yeah. It has to be through the barrel of

(21:18) a gun and force of will. And so I think

(21:20) that they're lying to us when they say

(21:22) that they want to rule because they

(21:25) they're the only ones who can rule

(21:26) fairly. What they really want is a

(21:27) monopoly on force. And they say that

(21:29) that the that we made up is better

(21:31) than the you made up while at the

(21:33) same time claiming they shouldn't follow

(21:34) what you made up because it's not true.

(21:37) So who are they really sacrificing then?

(21:39) It's just they're basically sacrificing

(21:40) everyone else but themselves and their

(21:42) own group.

(21:42) Yes, that's correct. They just want a

(21:44) monopoly on force and they don't want

(21:45) Christians to have the monopoly on force

(21:47) because they don't want to be proven

(21:48) wrong.

(21:48) But I'm claiming that if it is the case

(21:50) that all of these rights, human rights,

(21:52) dignities, things like this are

(21:54) completely made up, arbitrarily, uh,

(21:57) made up because they just really like

(21:59) them, but they know that they're not

(22:00) true and they're willing to use force,

(22:02) then even if they thought they were true

(22:05) and were willing to use for, even if

(22:06) they did think that, it wouldn't matter,

(22:08) right? Because you could always apply

(22:11) the same standard back. You can just

(22:12) say, "Hey, look, you believe in

(22:14) something that isn't true. You're

(22:16) willing to use force to defend it. Even

(22:18) if I believe in something that isn't

(22:19) true, you really can't say I can't use

(22:22) force to defend it."

(22:23) Well, wouldn't that be a tragic vanity

(22:25) of being in vain? That it's all for not.

(22:27) It's just for the temporariness.

(22:28) Yeah. Well, I'm Well, the the point

(22:30) here, whether or not it's vanity, is

(22:33) just to say they believe in something

(22:34) that they don't think is true, but

(22:36) they're willing to use force for it.

(22:38) Okay.

(22:38) Understood. Appreciate the talk. Oh, we

(22:40) don't even have to. Yeah, we don't even

(22:41) have to.
