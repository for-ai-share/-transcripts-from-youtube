(0:00) yours is this is based on your own worldview that's not based on reality moral worldview is not based on reality
(0:06) whatsoever listen listen what do you mean pre preference but Pawn is not banned it's my prence listen it's my
(0:13) preference to follow Christian ethics it's my preference to follow all the preferences of God it's my preference to do all these things is any of that
(0:20) immoral like is it immoral that you have those preferences yeah even if they're wrong like let's Grant Christianity was
(0:26) not true let's just grant it for the sake of argument it's totally untrue it's totally fake it's totally false it never occurred I just believe it because
(0:32) it's my preference is that in any way wrong to hold their standards now yeah
(0:38) believe in freedom of expression freedom of speech if that's the cas if that's the case is that right then all that
(0:43) matters is that it's my preference Christianity is true it's my preference that porn be banned and I'm at no more
(0:49) of an immoral position than you are so you can't even say that me wanting to ban porn based specifically on just my
(0:57) own preference is in any way even I don't think it I'm not a thought
(1:03) police I'm I'm not Christian yeah you're the ones that do thought policing but if
(1:08) I try to enact my thoughts on to you because it's my preference why is that
(1:15) bad wait that's completely different are you talking about enforce like State enforcing violations human rights I walk
(1:22) over well that's different than just holding an opinion why that's really weird if I want it's my preference
(1:28) though no the there's a difference between preferences and state enforcement right that's all
(1:35) preferences it's based preference no it's all preference a king had prefers
(1:41) that you be [ __ ] oppressed why is he wrong so your same standard what you
(1:48) consider morally good is that based on God's preferences it's based on my preferences
(1:54) for God's preferences or so something is morally good just because God commands it no
(2:00) it's good because it's my preference that it's good wait so then God has nothing to do with it no it's my preference that God's
(2:06) preferences be enforced so then I'm correct that something is morally good simply because
(2:12) God commands it no it' be is morally good because it's my preference that everything God morally commands be
(2:18) enforced okay that's what I just said and that means it's completely arbitrary and based on your own personal
(2:23) preference so is yours I agree I'm not only one that that though if that's the
(2:29) case then only one who's going to admit that hey I'll just bite it that's the case and we're just uh doing uh
(2:34) arbitrary [ __ ] and we're just basing it on our own personal preferences then if I get a whole army with machine guns to
(2:41) come in and say no more [ __ ] porn you can't actually say there's anything wrong with that right no I can because
(2:48) now we're talking about state enforcement of violating people's rights which is completely different than just
(2:54) holding a thought in your mind but it's my preference and I'm the ultimate Arbiter of what is moral just like you
(2:59) what are you not understanding between like thought policing and state enforcement well I don't well here's
(3:05) what I don't understand if I want to use force and I say that it's moral because it's my preference can you demonstrate
(3:11) how that's immoral if like if you're actually actively using force or if you're just
(3:18) thinking about if I kick in your [ __ ] door right now yes tell me how it's immoral how because you are violating my
(3:25) personal autonomy so what you're that's all your preference yes yeah so so my preference what about
(3:33) my preference I'm my moral framework is um I'm
(3:42) concerned with this was more like a sparring session a warm-up exercise for Andrew Wilson before he goes onto an
(3:48) actual real debate he debates didley donger I believe her name is her name should have been Diddley squat because
(3:54) that's how much she actually knows let's see how this debate goes down atal explicit content as I'm going to put it
(4:01) should be banned so I'm going to head it over to Andrew to respond to some of what he just heard but in the meantime
(4:06) I'd ask you guys to smash the like button and prepare those super chats because we are going to ask them at the end of the open discussion over to you
(4:12) Andrew yeah so dly I'm not a big fan of Gish gallops during a debate I like to go down one line at a time so we can get
(4:18) it figured out if we have consistency issues we don't have consistency issues are you willing to do that yeah okay
(4:24) could we start with defining pornography well actually I think we needed to start by defining horm
(4:32) what is that um something that results in negative outcomes and how do we
(4:38) measure what a negative outcome is um we can do that multiple ways we
(4:43) can look okay go ahead sorry oh go ahead sorry we could look at happiness we
(4:49) could look at um how a society is functioning in terms of maybe economic
(4:56) success yeah what way what way do you use what way do I use MH to determine harm
(5:04) to determine harm yes you don't have to repeat the question you just answer the question what what do you mean what way
(5:10) do I use to determine harm what metric would you use to determine harm well I
(5:15) would use multiple metrics not just one okay so if somebody was really happy for instance about I don't know unal living
(5:22) themselves is that harm is it harm for someone to be happy
(5:28) about killing themselves yeah well they would be causing calm to themselves by killing themselves yes yeah so we should
(5:34) not have that right or we should uh people probably shouldn't kill themselves yeah okay and that that's
(5:40) because of this harm principle yeah okay if you had two
(5:45) brothers who were twins okay and uh they wanted to have sex with each other uh
(5:52) can you give me a single reason that would be harmful um there could be potentially
(5:58) some kind of power Dynamics at play that could be harmful they're twins twins
(6:04) maybe not then so you wouldn't have any objection to incest for instance under this worldview um well I have an
(6:10) objection just on the level of like yeah I think it's icky well but wait a second
(6:15) they're really happy and how does it affect you uh yeah I honestly don't really care could we get back onto the
(6:22) to we are back to the topic I'm trying to figure out what your harm principle is I'm not going to let you evade so all
(6:28) I'm doing is trying to consist I don't care yeah I I that's great I don't care is not an argument and it's not a
(6:34) response to one it's not even I don't I wouldn't see that as a morally okay you're right I don't care about the
(6:40) debate that was I don't care that was my answer okay great I don't care is not an
(6:46) answer I'm asking you a question well no it is because you're asking me if I find I'm saying I don't care yeah so does
(6:52) that no so I don't find it immoral oh so then the answer would be no right yes okay great so next time say no
(7:00) and then I'll know that you actually mean no when you say that okay so if somebody had a dead body in their backyard and they dug it up and had sex
(7:06) with it every day and uh nobody found out about it would that be immoral uh yeah why um because as a
(7:14) society we've um decided that we have some level of respect for the dead and
(7:20) also it would probably harm the people who are related to the person who died
(7:25) I'm super confused if what if you're the only person who knows dead bodies there they have no I said we as Society of
(7:30) deemed that we have respect for the dead what if the person writes a note saying
(7:36) I want to have my body had sex with after I'm dead by my son whenever he wants he can dig me up and have sex with
(7:43) that dead body is that okay we could also have someone say yeah I consent to someone eating me alive I still think
(7:48) that is a level of harm that is unacceptable yeah but you haven't really told me why you just keep saying you keep on making these uh weird General
(7:55) Illusions to we as Society have determined but the way we would use the metric under a harm principle for if
(8:02) society's doing the right thing or the wrong thing would be based on harm so if Society is doing something with yes and
(8:09) I think for those particular things you've outlined a level of harm that we deem unacceptable I don't know why
(8:14) you're interrupting me so if Society is doing something uh which is actually not
(8:21) harmful and they have decided that that's okay right uh then I don't
(8:27) understand why you're not saying that Society needs to let people dig up uh
(8:32) you know Aunt fester in the backyard and have sex with her body unless you can demonstrate who that actually harms
(8:38) because society would just be wrong then right uh no no because as I've explained
(8:44) a few times now um we have a respect for the debt as a society so that would be violating that kind of social contract I
(8:52) see so so society and society's moral intuitions become a social contract
(8:58) which we should adhere to yeah okay so as long as I change society's mind about porn uh being bad
(9:05) and sure so let's begin could you hang hang on stop stop stop I just want to make sure I got this correct wouldn't it
(9:11) would it then not be the case that if Society agreed that porn was bad that
(9:17) would now be a new social contract based on their intuition and you B based on your own harm principle would have to
(9:24) concede that you should not do then porn right because you be violating people
(9:30) don't see porn as harmful bad that's not my question I didn't ask what is I asked about are you saying hypothetically yeah
(9:36) I'm asking about an oim that would be be so this would kind of go back to like what I said about fast food which is
(9:42) something that is obviously like objectively bad for us um but we still allow people the freedom to eat it as
(9:48) much as they want even though it's obviously has devastating outcomes nobody's disputing that so anyway so my
(9:54) question is so my answer would be the exact same for yeah if Society that's not my question my answer is my my
(10:00) question is since you say these things as a society we deem them to be bad and that's why they're bad not that they're
(10:07) bad because you think it violates a harm principle then ultimately the Arbiter of
(10:12) what you think is moral is society right uh to an extent I like we have
(10:18) societal rules yes um so for example if every single person who watched porn off
(10:23) to thems yeah we probably shouldn't have Pawn okay I'm super into you have to you
(10:30) have to help me out here I'm trying to figure this out do is society the rul maker or is
(10:37) harm the rulemaker like which thing is the rulemaker here which thing which thing do you consider kind of
(10:43) interchangeable yeah so which thing do you consider moral is it is it what Society is it what Society rule rules as
(10:50) moral or is it what the harm principle rules as moral well Society basically
(10:56) has um like we're the ones that have created the harm principle it's kind of
(11:02) interchangeable yeah that doesn't answer my question so you have a view of what's moral and immoral inside your brain
(11:08) right okay so is that based on harm or is it based on what society
(11:13) says harm it's based on harm so then if it's if something is demonstrated to be
(11:20) harmful it's immoral and if something is I'm sorry it's not no why so like I said
(11:28) from like from the very beginning this girl doesn't know what she's talking about she can't she's not consistent she
(11:33) keeps changing it up Andrew is confused I'm confused we're all confused makes sense lady if you're enjoying this clip
(11:39) so far uh smash that like button please thank you very much let's continue from the very beginning I've stated multiple
(11:45) times there is a level of harm that our society deems acceptable this is why
(11:52) fast asking switching the argument though it doesn't make any sense I I asked you you
(12:00) I'm not deba am I debating with Society or am I debating with you wait what part AR you who am I debating with Society or
(12:06) you can you answer my question what what part aren't you understanding not understanding the part about who well
(12:11) here's what I need to reiterate so since I'm debating with you about whether or not a thing ought be done I'm debating
(12:17) with would you like me to describe like what myal frame did you just ask me to give you an
(12:23) answer and then cut me off while I was giving it to you yes okay so would you like me to give the answer or would you
(12:28) like to go on I would like to know if you want me to give you the moral framework that I'm working from is that what okay let's go
(12:35) with utilitarianism yeah that's okay so that would be a harm principle right yes and there are obviously harms that we
(12:42) accept within our societ but when you say when you say we I'm not interested in what we accept I'm interested in what
(12:48) the person interested in reality that's great but I'm interested in what you accept because I'm debating with you I'm
(12:54) not debating with a guy over there I'm not debating with the moderator I'm not debating with Stephen I'm debating with
(12:59) didley so didley I'm looking at your view for what is moral what is immoral
(13:05) from didley's view is it immoral for two brothers to have sex with each
(13:11) other can we get back onto the topic on I've already answered this question no
(13:17) I'm ask you not hear the first time hear the first time I want to make sure it's from Europe did you not hear the first time no because the first time you said
(13:23) Society has blah blah blah and then no that was about digging up dead bodies and that too that too is that immoral
(13:30) from your view if we need to reiterate already I already stated it you said society says blah I'm ask what's
(13:38) annoying is is that this girl has changed her position several times already and she's asking like Andrew
(13:43) like I I already said this what do you need me to explain to you again were you not paying attention no the problem was
(13:49) Andrew was paying attention but you go from saying one thing and then you switch it up to another thing and so
(13:56) then when he's on track and then he asks you okay so you believe this then you switch it up again didley's view is it
(14:02) yes and I I agree from from your I've already wait Ryan can you I already explained this
(14:10) did I not no no so listen well I was gonna say I'm
(14:15) going to ask you again if you just be quiet for a second I'll reiterate the the question I just want to know the answer from your view Without You
(14:22) shifting it that okay well I don't know I hav question we'll let him ask
(14:27) question so I'm going to ask the question what I'm asking specifically is this from diddley's view not society's view
(14:33) not not Joe's view not anybody else's view from the view of a utilitarian harm principle somebody had a contract from
(14:40) Grandma saying he could hum her as much as he wanted after she was dead okay and
(14:46) there there was uh no reason that that would lead to any type of contagion to anybody else from your view is that
(14:52) immoral yes why as I stated earlier it is uh
(14:59) violating the way that we Respect the Dead well no no no that's wait that
(15:05) makes no sense you're making now and appealed again to we okay sorry I oh I
(15:12) respect the dead why there's no harm well no I believe that there is what's
(15:17) the harm what is it that is the harm being done what is
(15:23) it what's the specific harm what is it the spe specific harm is that you are
(15:30) in complete violation of social contract what wait a second a so a social
(15:36) contract so if it's a social contract then again you're now you're deferring
(15:42) once again over away from your harm principle to some type of societal
(15:47) principle that's really weird from harm reductionist the harm reductionist you just told me that your
(15:54) moral prism revolves around utilitarianism and harm reduction I asked you that would fall under
(16:00) rule I asked you what you just read that from your own chat you don't even you couldn't even tell me what I don't even
(16:05) have chat I'll tell you what tell me what rule utilitarianism is what tell me what rule utilitarianism even is put
(16:11) your hands up before you Google it though because I know you're Googling now tell me what what is what is Rule utilitarianism so um reducing harm is
(16:20) good um and reducing uh bad things is
(16:25) good you don't know what rule utilitarianism is tell me what it is what is it so act
(16:31) utilit utilitarianism would be like there are certain situations where um
(16:37) for example r utilis i about util I'm
(16:42) getting can you let me answer the question I'm glad we move utilitarianism let's go down is basically yeah uh
(16:49) certain situations might call for things that might be morally um wrong could
(16:55) potentially be good so for example killing someone could be good if it turns out that that person grows up to
(17:02) be Hitler uh ruer utilitarianism would uh not be an in agreeance with this
(17:07) because kill killing someone is generally always IM moral whates that no that would be the
(17:14) difference between deontology and utilitarianism there nothing to do with rule utilitarianism you gave me a
(17:20) deontological ethic what is Rule utilitarianism can you describe it for me then no I need you to you said you're
(17:26) a rule utilitarian Okay so get this right murder's always
(17:31) wrong no okay well then you're not what what are you talking about right what
(17:38) you're rule utilitarian is you said killing Hitler would always be wrong why would killing Hitler always be wrong for
(17:43) you the rule utilitarian is well because it would be from the perspective that murder is wrong so why is murder
(17:51) wrong because even if it reduces harm because that's the social contract
(18:00) yet again what what are you talking about wa hang on I got we actually start
(18:05) discussing discussion we're right now we're just talking about basic ethical Frameworks we can even get into the debate I want to ask so so just to get
(18:13) this right you said a rule utilitarian would say against an act utilitarian you
(18:19) can't go back in time and kill Hitler cuz that's wrong why is that
(18:24) wrong because killing is bad why even if it reduces
(18:30) harm yeah why um because you are violating
(18:36) someone's personal autonomy even if it reduces and violating someone's personal autonomy is morally bad okay why if it
(18:45) if it reduce if it reduces harm to violate autonomy why would that be bad because violating someone's personal
(18:52) autonomy is like detrimental to their well-being wait a second if you violate
(18:59) Hitler's personal autonomy thus killing Hitler you would save the lives of
(19:04) millions upon millions of people how's that not the ultimate and harm reduction you're saying that we shouldn't do that
(19:10) because you would violate his personal autonomy sure okay well then if that's
(19:16) the case then I should never defend myself if I'm being attacked by somebody because that would violate their
(19:22) personal aony that that is not I want to jump that is not the same thing whatsoever that would be self well wait
(19:28) wait wait I'm sorry be an example of self-defense isn't killing but the reason self-defense is good is because it reduces harm to you the non-
(19:35) aggressor right same thing killing Hitler the reason killing Hitler would be good yeah but someone is like trying
(19:40) to kill you versus someone merely existing in your presence I'm going to ask I'm G ask Andrew if you can just to
(19:46) really hardcore tie this into the what you the meat beaten topic she's asking
(19:53) to make she's asking to make moral prescriptions for things inside of society as to what is moral what is not
(19:59) what is immoral that's going to be determin determined and she brought this up in an opening statement said
(20:04) Christians they have x value y value whatever right that's totally fine it's complet
(20:45) it doesn't make perfect sense just because you say it makes perfect sense and by the way wouldn't evil German man
(20:53) be infringing on uh millions of people's personal bodily autonomy by doing what
(20:59) he did so wouldn't it be a good thing so what part of that doesn't make sense to you well because then you have a
(21:04) conflicting value that saying autonomy is actually the principle which is moral
(21:09) not harm well yes but autonomy is intrinsically linked to harm well no it
(21:19) taking away people's autonomy and freedoms is harmful you can definitely reduce people's freedom and and it could
(21:25) be not very harmful like for instance should I own a nuclear bomb no why not what about my autonomy what
(21:32) if I build my back that's just unaccept wait wait wait hang on hang on no no I can't let it go why is it opening a
(21:40) nuclear b a discussion about morality it's not a discuss it's very important that well I'm sorry you want me to say
(21:46) that I'm going to ban porn based on moral grounds and yet I can't uh understand my opponent's morality last question I'll tie it in very quickly
(21:53) very quickly why can't I own a nuclear bomb because it is a level of H that we
(21:58) deem unacceptable okay okay but you we deem it unacceptable Society does would
(22:05) you prefer if I just said I every time yeah I'm not debating you perfectly I
(22:10) think you perfectly understand what I mean when I say that I don't because because here's what's no no well first of all semantics are super important to
(22:16) a debate I don't know if you know that or not because it's clarifying what it is we're talking about in this point when we're talking about nucar bomb and
(22:22) I own it you say autonomy is the highest value a person should have because to violate it is to do harm but then when I
(22:29) say if I have a nuclear bomb you say that's too much harm for society so they deem it inappropriate uh yes because
(22:35) your personal autonomies can't infringe on other people's autonomy can't just kill anyone you want it got it so our
(22:42) our value for Morality is actually autonomy then yes which is intrinsically
(22:48) linked to harm no it's not yes it is explain how it isn't explain you can
(22:53) give you can yeah you can limit people's freedoms for their own good and it delivers less harm and more happiness to
(22:59) him so it is linked to h no I'm saying it's when we talking
(23:04) about H in the sentence okay well then then everything is linked to everything I'm linking it to your harm principle so
(23:11) what I'm saying to you is is that yes of course you can make a reduction in harm
(23:17) or whatever with any metrics you want but autonomy itself right you say ah
(23:23) it's linked to this harm thing okay great but I still don't haven't actually established what the moral parameters
(23:30) are if it's if we harm thing and that uh
(23:36) you know autonomy or whatever whatever like your other AIS is let's say more good happens than bad thing happens that
(23:43) means I should I should do that thing right you say no can you repeat that okay so let's say
(23:51) I say I I do an action right and more good things happen for people than bad
(23:56) things should I do that action well wait it's highly dependent on what the action is why yeah that but then that's not
(24:05) utilitarianism unless unless no it is because then again like because your
(24:11) autonomy cannot infringe on other people's autonomy why that's why like why can't it because personal autonomy
(24:18) is something that is intrinsically linked to people's well-being and I care about wellbeing yeah but well why do you
(24:25) care about wellbeing because otherwise it's harmful to not have well-being right uh we kind of have a biological imperative to care about well-being cuz
(24:32) that's kind of what AIDS our survival but how do you determine well-being except harm this harm
(24:37) idea how do I determine well-being yeah uh people's happiness and that would be
(24:43) linked to harm or is it just what makes people happy that's what I'm saying like if it makes everybody happy to molest children
(24:50) should we do that uh no again okay well then well then it's not just about people's I don't have any idea what your
(24:57) actual world who is all right you promise yeah I don't think she knows what it is it sounds like to me she's
(25:03) never had a deep thought in her life she's never actually deeply thought about any of these things she knows what
(25:09) she knows because pretty much Society has taught her this is what's right and this is what's wrong which is why she
(25:15) keeps appealing to society and the social contract thing she actually doesn't know why it's wrong to do the um
(25:22) how do you say the horizontal Mambo with a deceased person she doesn't know why
(25:27) it's wrong she just Society tells her that it's wrong but she's actually never thought about well
(25:33) why is that wrong all right so can we now hear what your world view is and then can we also Circle back
(25:40) to you defining pornography that's what we're going to do I think I think that all things which are harmful should be
(25:45) banned that includes alcohol and fried food and cigarettes and everything wait so you do bite the bullet then on
(25:51) Banning fast food you think like ma is sorry McDonald's what do I care fast
(25:56) food plac should be B care if you got rid of McDonald's I don't care get rid of it uh do you think people should um
(26:04) should it be illegal for people to go out in the sun since uh skin cancer is
(26:10) harmful uh do you think it should be illegal to go out in the sun then since skin cancer is harmful yeah first of all
(26:16) going out in the sun doesn't guarantee that you're going to get skin cancer also there are benefits to going out in
(26:21) the sun and getting Sunshine there is vitamin D which we needs which we get from the Sun so there are health
(26:27) benefits too from going outside and playing and getting fresh air there are no benefits to eating fast food all the
(26:33) time fast food is inherently bad for you there are no upsides to eating fast food
(26:39) uh healthwise convenience wise there are upsides but health-wise there are zero
(26:45) health benefits from fast food therefore if they did ban fast food yeah it's
(26:50) probably for the best and I love fast food but I know it's bad for me so yeah
(26:55) if they wanted to ban fast food I would have no problem with it it's is not the same as going outside and going out and
(27:02) getting some fresh air oh I oh wait a second wait a second skin cancer harmful but does the
(27:08) Sun cause skin cancer does the Sun cause skin
(27:13) cancer yes okay and are there other things which would cause skin cancer
(27:18) other than the sun uh like smoking
(27:26) sure yeah yeah okay wait so you would ban people going out so I just want to so I just want to make sure that I got
(27:32) this right let's say I ban well I'm just using the same metric you are let say I ban McDonald's because society says so
(27:39) right they they don't like McDonald's anymore and then I ban alcohol because society says so they don't like alcohol anymore and then we ban porn because
(27:46) society says so because they don't like porn anymore do you actually have a any problem with any of
(27:52) this uh well it depends what do you mean because they say sir no just Society in
(27:58) the social contract is said no more M well no because like if society says that we love slavery I don't think we should legalize slavery oh well then I'm
(28:07) really confused about what what what can you answer my question about should we ban people going outside in the sun no
(28:14) why well because there's no because there's no social
(28:19) contract for Banning you said we should ban things at a hum yeah if well if
(28:24) they're not there's no social contract I mean if we don't have a social contract We Can't Ban it right so if people think it's bad then
(28:31) that's you don't you don't actually understand I'm still doing an internal critique but here's what I'll do well I
(28:36) have asked for your I'll help you I'll help you out continually asked you
(28:43) towork here's my framework I operate under the framework of Christian ethics Christian ethics is going to be a
(28:49) biblically founded ethical system which comes from the church okay it comes from the church and it comes from the Bible
(28:55) and it comes from the teachings of Jesus Christ right that's my moral ethical system and so it's with within those
(29:02) parameters the belief in Jesus Christ uh that would be the way in which I would
(29:07) act and the thresholds with which I would act and why I would I would value things like Duty though harm harm
(29:13) principles are included in Christian ethics yes all of those things when it comes to cornography I think it's
(29:18) perfectly appropriate uh for us under Christian ethics to ban that uh for
(29:23) thing for other things other considerations like things like dignity dignity to society dignity to a person
(29:31) uh things like this in the moral consideration if you were to get rid of cornography all together uh I I'm not
(29:37) I'm not sure how Society gets worse um so are you saying that
(29:43) basically things that you would deem banable in society is just based on the
(29:48) Bible so we should ban any it's not based on just the Bible what were the metrics that I gave you so the Bible and
(29:55) the church and the teachings of Jes Jesus Christ right so the Bible well no
(30:01) you have here's the thing Jesus Christ said all of my teachings would never fit in this book so there's also things like
(30:06) divine revelation uh revelation of our Saints there's uh many other factors
(30:12) that would go into the complex system which is Christian ethics but I have an what I have that you don't have is an
(30:18) unchanging standard from which to appeal you don't even have any standard from which to appeal you just say either
(30:25) Society has a social contract that they don't like it or that's it you you have
(30:30) have not actually demonstrated why anything would be immoral except just my preference so have you read the Bible
(30:37) before uhhuh is there anything in the Bible that you would deem morally
(30:43) reprehensible what does that have to do with this debate what because it's your entire
(30:50) moral framework well wait a second I thought that the when we were I was questioning your moral framework that wasn't allowed now it's allowed I never
(30:57) said it was allowed oh okay then why did I have to move off when I had pinned you down on your utilitarian ethical
(31:02) framework and now you get to move into mine can can the moderator explain that to me so you're arguing from the
(31:08) affirmative and I don't get to hear your moral framework I'm I'm willing to give it to you I just don't understand why it
(31:13) is that you answer the question but I don't but can you answer the question no I don't find anything objectionable in
(31:18) Christian ethics okay would you mind if I read out some Bible cards
(31:23) then um go ahead so you could tell that this is pretty much all she was waiting waiting for if this is basic b word
(31:31) atheist oh haha gotcha it says this in the Bible are you so you support that
(31:38) then it's a way for people who want to justify their sins these are this is
(31:43) their go-to arguments in order to be like see and then therefore I don't have to listen to Christianity or God or what
(31:50) have you it is just an excuse for people who want to keep sinning go ahead so are you for legalizing rape uh there's no
(31:57) such legalism the Bible okay so by the way and then you'll see that she actually has no idea what she's talking
(32:03) about she's never actually read the Bible she just cherry-picks the parts that sound bad uh having no idea what
(32:09) the context is as you'll see Deuteronomy 22:28 if a man happens to meet a virgin
(32:14) who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered he shall pay her father 50 shekels of
(32:19) silver he must marry the young woman for his violated her he can never divorce her for as long as he lives is this
(32:25) something that you would morally uphold uh for the do you know what the fallacy of presentism is uh no yeah well I'm
(32:33) going to explain it to you the fallacy of presentism is you looking through a present view for things which are
(32:40) culturally considered to be bad or things like this without actually looking through the system of the time
(32:45) Through The Eyes of the people of the time so here's what's that's interesting cuz didn't you just say a moral system is unchanging yeah stop I'm not changing
(32:52) it I'm telling you no you said it's unchanging so why does the time you're using a fallacious argument
(32:58) you're the one who is using a Time argument in order to say that something
(33:03) is moral or immoral let me explain and then you know at the time first of all
(33:09) this is not rape okay here's what was actually happening if it was the case that a man
(33:15) were to assault a woman there's very few people in this time period if it is the
(33:20) case that a man were to assault a woman like this okay and do horrible things to her uh he would be held to account under
(33:27) a pat archal system okay what do you do with these people well often they put
(33:33) them to death okay and well in this case he's forced to marry her and can never
(33:38) divorce her in Deuteronomy it also moves into death it moves into death for rap
(33:44) this this specific that I'm talking about he must marry her and never divorce her the B self referencing right
(33:51) so Deuteronomy doesn't just have one passage in it does it does it have other passages MH oh okay great and so so I
(33:58) can read some more if you would like keep reading uh okay so Deuteronomy 22:20 uh but if the thing is true the
(34:05) evidences of virginity are not found for the young woman then they shall bring out the young woman to the door of her
(34:11) father's home and the men of her City shall Stone her to death with stones because she has done a disgraceful thing
(34:16) in Israel you cond this wait read it one more time I just want to make sure by the way which uh version are you reading
(34:22) out of uh this is the new King James version which I believe is the version
(34:27) that your Orthodox Church uh uses right no but I mean close enough I I can I can
(34:32) get a different one if you want no it's fine just read it again um so but if the thing is true the evidences of virginity
(34:39) are not found for the young woman give me the passage first sorry um okay I can get the context before that no no I just
(34:47) want the passage keep yeah go ahead so this is Deuteronomy 22:20 mhm but if the
(34:54) thing is true the evidences of virginity are not found for the young woman then they shall bring out the young woman to
(34:59) the door of her father's house and the men of her City shall Stone her to death with stones because she has done a disgraceful thing in
(35:06) Israel yeah so is there something you condone yeah so Deuteronomy is referencing the law which is given to
(35:12) the Jews I follow Christian ethics do I follow Jewish okay well we can talk
(35:18) instead about let's see um well we can talk about Genesis um so that would be
(35:26) okay you want to what about Genesis we can talk about the genocide that God committed against the entire
(35:32) world it's a lovely children's story I'm sure you've heard of it it's commonly known as no when he killed evil people
(35:39) so Genesis 6:6 and the Lord was sorry that he made man on Earth and he was grieved in his heart so the Lord said I
(35:45) will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the Earth both man and the Beast creeping thing and bird of the
(35:50) air for I'm sorry that I've made them and I heard just a little comment earlier so wait so you endorse you
(35:56) endorse this genocide uh if if you killed every evil person on earth oh no it was everyone on
(36:03) planet Earth except for the the few people who were on the ark that's because they we're cool we're just
(36:09) wiping off the entire planet if they were all evil so evil meaning that they simply weren't obeying God evil as in
(36:17) they were raping murdering thieving no no no this is just people who like God was no it definitely isn't you need to
(36:23) go back and Genesis imagine this girl she's trying to correct Andrew Wilson someone who's actually read the Bible
(36:29) about what the context was behind Noah's Arc and why God did what he did the nerve of this woman again change your
(36:36) name to didly squat cuz that's how much she knows if you're enjoying this clip so far please smash that like button
(36:42) subscribe to my channel you'll be helping me out a lot let's continue because all right well we can go instead
(36:47) to no I think I think I think first we're going to respond thus says the Lord Of Hearts I will punish am for what
(36:54) he did to Israel how ambushed him I just you just really couldn't hold on
(37:00) just before you move on could I finish this this is complet really could I was say before we do the completely separate
(37:06) from Noah's Arc I do think it's fair just because you know somebody I am very interested in doing this type of unpack
(37:12) but I do think it is fair for Andrew to say that uh as the Bible I think does describe them as wicked people but go
(37:18) ahead there Andrew uh you know whether you think that's valid or not you know you can debate that but sure and God describes anyone who doesn't believe him
(37:25) as wicked people that's why they get condemned because what he's what the reference
(37:30) there is is a referencing that people who don't don't have some type of synergistic relationship with God are
(37:36) doing wicked things like raping murdering I don't know prostitution things like that right so do you agree
(37:43) that simply not believing in God means you are wicked no I think that not believing in God so you have to
(37:49) understand that there's two different covens which you're talking about so I'm I I believe in the New Covenant of
(37:54) Christianity when you're talking about what Jesus Christ came right he set down what Christian ethical
(38:00) law is you continuously reference Jewish law which has nothing to do with Christian ethics I have no idea why
(38:07) you're doing that what what moral framework did I say I followed uh you specifically said do you
(38:13) follow the church ethics yes Christi this is the Christian Bible yeah but do
(38:19) you re do you recognize that in the Christian Bible there's people groups who have specific laws which are given
(38:25) to them which is made for Jews only for specific reasons that there's a new covenant under Jesus Christ and it's the
(38:31) New Covenant under Jesus Christ with his two additional Commandments The Ten Commandments things like this and
(38:36) Christian ethics under the guidance of Jesus Christ that we follow do you get that so saying you don't condone these
(38:42) acts is that what what you're getting I'm saying I follow Christian ethics and you don't understand what you're reading
(38:48) so there so do you or do you not condone the genocide and the Bible they're not genocides yeah I think why is it not
(38:54) genocide I think if you kill a lot of wait can you define genoci yeah so can you just stop talking so anyway I did
(39:01) I'm allowing great okay so I think if you kill lots and lots and lots of bad people that's fine if you call that a
(39:08) genocide I don't care white so can you define genocide
(39:13) well however you define it's fine if you think it's a if you think it's a genocide how do you not agree that
(39:19) that's genocide oh if if you're defining that as a genocide fine I'll concede if you kill all the bad people and that's
(39:25) genocide I don't care okay well you just said it wasn't a genocide so that's nice
(39:30) um so okay so now we've established my moral Foundation of Christian ethics I
(39:37) like that you both had an I don't care moment this kind well why do I why do I care about whatever the um the idea of
(39:44) whatever she considers genocide to be yeah so that's kind of exactly my point is that your moral framework does not
(39:51) care whatsoever about people's well-being you care only for oh really it's my moral okay I see so let's just
(39:57) make sure I got this right I'm willing to say that it's acceptable for evil
(40:03) people to get killed you would save Hitler uh yeah that's what she said she
(40:09) said she wouldn't do anything to Hitler because that would be infringing on his on his bodily autonomy right um okay so
(40:17) evil people would uh include anyone who doesn't believe in God so you're saying
(40:23) you condone no that's a straw man did I say did I say that's what makes person evil you said that so you don't agree no
(40:30) of course not and would you like for me to give you reference in who don't believe in God sent why they sent to
(40:37) hell to suffer for all eternity orod not evil the Orthodox don't believe in hell in that way I don't know if you knew
(40:42) that or not but also just so you understand if you're talking about Paul and you're talking about the apostles
(40:48) the apostles uh would often talk about how there's good written on people's hearts that comes from God right and
(40:55) that we are not to take WRA ful judgment against people kill them things like this that's against the bones of
(41:02) Christian ethics now if it is the case that evil people are trying to dominate or do bad things and God smites them for
(41:09) doing that well I mean what are you going to do about it what are you going to do about it maybe could we see like
(41:17) what constitutes as like an evil person for you is it to adulterers count as evil I think that that's a sinful act
(41:25) but it it wouldn't necessarily facilitate I'll explain how the Orthodox view um sin so it what we would say is
(41:34) that's sinful but think about this beer so every sin you do if you have small sins it fills up the beer bottle a
(41:40) little bit if you have large sins it fills up the beer bottle a lot more right all sin is corrupting and all sin
(41:46) is bad right and the more sin you have in you the more corrupted you are but that doesn't mean that you're not
(41:53) redeemable and it doesn't even necessarily mean that you're evil there could be sins of Omission for instance
(41:58) that you have I'm going to have to Andrew yeah we wouldn't consider that to be evil right uh but all sin is Born To
(42:05) God right it's just that there's metrics for which they poison you the person
(42:11) what you're doing is you're trying to argue with a Protestant of which I'm not and I don't know why you're trying to do
(42:16) that it's very silly this aside I have I have an unchanging standard you have a changing
(42:23) standard so when we're talking about porn and banning porn what I'm trying to do is get consistency from you if porn
(42:31) now I've just answered your questions please answer mine Society itself is society itself from your view the
(42:37) Arbiter of what is moral or isn't it uh it's a society the Arbiter of
(42:44) what's moral yes no so then you're the Arbiter of what's moral me personally
(42:51) yes I mean I don't think so I think who the [ __ ] is the Arbiter of what's moral I well I would say I have a good like
(42:58) moral framework which aims to uh inre you're the what's moral um not necessarily no well then
(43:06) who is um I think it's better when people
(43:12) like come together and agree on things that would benefit societ based on
(43:17) empiricism and how many people then would be the Arbiter of what is moral how many people does it take before we
(43:22) have an Arbiter of what is moral oh well that's like why we have things like democracy isn't it no that's not why we have things like democracy unless you're
(43:29) saying Kings can't decide what are moral but that iside they a king can't decide
(43:34) what's moral well they behave in like a way that is like beneficial to them not for the benefit of people usually you
(43:41) behave in a ways that are beneficial to you I'm not a king or a queen why would
(43:46) that matter why couldn't a king why couldn't a king make or moral decisions
(43:52) for their people I don't get that not saying they can't I'm saying interest so then the Arbiter of morality is who what
(44:00) an idiot she just automatically assumes so in her head she Associates King with bad King with like dominance king would
(44:06) just oh they're only in there to to serve themselves in other words she's just going from the framework all king's
(44:12) bad when in reality a king is a human being just like she is a human being just like we're all human beings and
(44:18) we're all selfish to an extent so what's the difference with the King going in there and potentially serving his own
(44:23) interest and a group of people putting something to votes and they're voting in
(44:29) their self-interest a king and regular people could both act in their self-interest and she doesn't understand
(44:36) is it you or is it someone who's not you who ultimately is the determiner of what
(44:41) is moral I don't believe in objective morality that's not what I'm asking you even so if it's objective morality then
(44:47) you definitely are the Arbiter of what is moral right in my own personal worldview yes okay so there is no such
(44:56) thing as object Ive morality is all subjective yeah okay so unless of course you can prove that God exists right now
(45:02) so then it just comes down to preferences uh yes and adds to yours oh okay well then it's my preference porn
(45:07) as band anything else
(45:13) um so this is where it starts to get really funny because Andrew starts arguing the same way that she is where
(45:19) everything just comes down to his personal preference and she gets irritated not knowing that this is
(45:25) exactly her own position yeah so I wanted to ask so obviously um you get
(45:31) all your moral would you say you're an adves I just I just told you it's my
(45:37) preference that porn is banned what's the problem so is that based on am I doing
(45:44) something wait am I doing something imal way that the Bible talks am I doing something moral or immoral or bad or
(45:52) awful or in any way against your worldview if my preference is that porn is Ban and so therefore it's
(45:58) banned uh well no it isn't oh okay well then if it's not immoral I don't care I'm the status quo not you oh okay so
(46:06) it's only your preferences which are moral and not mine uh in well I mean in my world view
(46:11) yes I'm obvious in my world in my world view it's the same way my moral my
(46:17) preferences are more moral than your preferences that's what you believe obviously so if your preferences are the
(46:24) and you're the orchestrator and arbiter of all that is moral and I also from my view am the orchestrator and arbiter of
(46:31) all that is moral how could the a third person determine which one of us is Right which one of us is actually the
(46:37) most that's a really great question actually because if you're um advocating for divine command Theory how would you
(46:44) argue against a Muslim who say does that have to do with my question I didn't ask you to ask me a question I asked you to answer a question can you answer my
(46:51) question what is what is it my question is this is that if it's the case
(46:57) that my preferences are the ultimate Arbiter of what is morality just like
(47:02) you claim yours is this is based on your or world viw that's not based on reality moral worldview is not based on reality
(47:09) whatsoever listen listen what do you mean pre preference but Pawn is not band
(47:14) it's my listen it's my preference to follow Christian ethics it's my preference to follow the preferences of
(47:20) God it's my preference to do all these things is any of that immoral like is it immoral that you have
(47:25) those preferences yeah if they're wrong like let's Grant Christianity was not true let's just grant it for the sake of
(47:31) argument it's totally untrue it's totally fake it's totally false it never occurred I just believe it because it's my preference is that in any way wrong
(47:39) to hold their standards now I believe in freedom of expression freedom of if that's the case like you if that's the
(47:44) case is that right then all that matters is that it's my preference Christianity is true it's my preference that porn be
(47:51) banned and I'm at no more of an immoral position than you are so you can't even say that me wanting to ban horn based
(47:58) specifically on just my own preference is in any way even
(48:03) bad I don't think I'm not a thought police I'm I'm not Christian yeah you're
(48:09) the ones that do thought policing but if I try to enact my thoughts on to you
(48:15) because it's my preference why is that bad wait that's completely different are
(48:21) you talking about enforce like State enforcing violations human rights I walk over well that's different than just
(48:26) holding an opinion why that's really weird if I want it's my preference though no that there's a difference
(48:33) between preferences and state enforcement right that's all preferences it's based preference no
(48:41) it's all preference a king had prefers that you be [ __ ] oppressed why is he
(48:47) wrong s just your same standard what you consider morally good is that based on
(48:53) God's preferences it's based on preferences for God's
(48:58) preferences or so something is morally good just because God commands it no it's good because it's my preference
(49:04) that it's good wait so then God has nothing to do with it no it's my preference that God's
(49:10) preferences be enforced so then I'm correct that something is morally good simply because
(49:15) God commands it no it' be is morally good because it's my preference that everything God morally commands being
(49:21) forced okay that's what I just said and that means it's completely arbitrary and based on your own personal preference so
(49:27) is yours I agree I'm the only one that will ad that though then if that's the case then if I'm the only one who's
(49:33) going to admit that I'll just bite it that's the case and we're just uh doing uh arbitrary [ __ ] and we're just basing
(49:39) it on our own personal preferences then if I get a whole army with machine guns to come in and say no more [ __ ] porn
(49:46) you can't actually say there's anything wrong with that right no I can because now we're talking about state
(49:54) enforcement of violating people's rights which is completely different than just holding a thought in your mind it's my
(49:59) preference and I'm the ultimate Arbiter of what is moral just like you what part are you not understanding between like
(50:04) thought policing and say enforcement well I don't well here's what I don't understand if I want to use force and I
(50:11) say that it's moral because it's my preference can you demonstrate how that's immoral if like if you're actually
(50:19) actively using Force if you're just thinking if I kick in your [ __ ] door right now tell me how it's immoral
(50:27) because you are violating my personal autonomy so what you're that's all your
(50:32) preference yes yeah so so my preference what about my
(50:38) preference I'm my moral framework is
(50:44) um I'm concerned with see Andrew is laughing because now he has forced her
(50:50) to go into her moral framework all on her own he is starting to argue her position cuz her position is just well
(50:56) it's my preference so he's like okay well it's my preference and to do this what makes my preference better than
(51:02) yours she's trying to say well it's because you're starting to go into States thing and stuff she doesn't
(51:07) realize though is that she is basing everything on her preference she her preference is she should just want Korn
(51:13) allow everyone should be able to watch K I mean obviously I'm assuming she's
(51:19) going to say of age to have access of corn people should be allowed to make
(51:24) corn that is her preference that's what she prefers uh people to do that is her preference
(51:29) of what is to be allowed she doesn't see though that that is kind of infringing on Andrew Wilson's preference on my
(51:38) preference on a lot of people's preference she thinks it is just freedom of expression but in reality it is
(51:45) infringing on people's beliefs and on people's infringements that why Andrew at the beginning tried to establish a
(51:52) moral ground a moral groundwork to see where she gets her values and her morals from but when she said well it is just
(51:59) my preference well now he's saying well this is just a a a useless debate then a pointless debate because if we're just
(52:06) arguing based on preference well then there's no point to this debate cuz it's just going to be an argument on preferences that is why he was doing all
(52:13) that questioning at the beginning people's wellbeing and yours isn't yours is based on simply what God tells you to
(52:19) even if that results in mass human suffering why is that even bad why is mass human suffering bad sure why is
(52:25) genocide bad yeah do you think those are good things I that's not what I asked you did I ask
(52:30) you to ask me or did I ask you no I was asking you first yeah why no I asked you first I said why is it bad I've already
(52:37) answered this multiple times you are violating people's personal autonomy which is morally wrong bad why is that bad can your answer is it bad to create
(52:45) mass human suffering yeah it's bad well no no no wait wait wait when you say mass human suffering I'm not sure that
(52:51) we have a standard for bad what do you mean by bad what does bad mean can you even Define what pornography is for me
(52:59) that do why you keep switching to the entire debate is the first thing I ask youing goalpost and answer my question
(53:06) what is bad and then I can answer your question bad is something that results in human suffering why is that
(53:13) bad uh because it is a complete violation of our intrinsic need to um
(53:20) have personal autonomy well then no I would say that human suffering is not bad as people go to the gym and they
(53:26) suffer and that's not bad okay just because I am interested to also if I use
(53:32) my bodily autonomy to infringe on someone else's body of autonomy let's say someone I knew was a drug addict and
(53:39) so I and I saw them you know about to inject themselves and let's say I swapped it out of their hand and then I
(53:46) took the the needle and I threw it in the the toilet or trash or what have you just somewhere where they couldn't get
(53:52) it uh I would be uh I would be infringing on their bodily autonomy does that lead to his Mass suffering well
(53:58) yeah temporarily it will because they're going to go through withdrawals but in the long term but in the long term it
(54:04) will be better for them but it's infringing on their bodily autonomy however it's not going to go it's not
(54:09) going to lead to long-term harm so there are times where you can infringe on someone's bodily autonomy and it's not a
(54:16) just uh inherently a bad thing or causing direct harm and you just because you did say you would
(54:22) Define it um yeah if you can give us a definition there maybe we can get back into uh some of the subjects so Andrew
(54:29) how would you de you know Define uh the terms of our debate tonight anything
(54:34) against my preferences is bad so can you define pornography anything that I deem to be
(54:42) pornographic which is what whatever is my preference to be pornographic which is what whatever it is can you be good
(54:49) faith for like a this is the most good faith I'm trying to explain to you how stupid you are so anything within my
(54:54) preference is whatever I think pornography is because it's my preference and that's the I'm the
(55:00) highest I am the highest I am the highest or Arbiter okay I'm just going
(55:05) to have to ask you a bunch of questions to find the real answer now so are Fe picks pornography um
(55:12) sure okay is literature pornography like 50 shes of gray kind thing can be I'll
(55:17) know it when I see it hold on so if somebody if somebody's going off on the like to this video right now are we
(55:24) doing something wrong I have to ask like if somebody is just like going to town on themselves right now watching this
(55:30) debate like just if you want to give us an answer there Andrew what what what are we doing just to be clear so you
(55:37) want to start essentially book burning so 50 Shades of Gray would be in there
(55:43) what are you talking about that's not that's not uh in my preference well we're talking about banning pornography yeah I know I only want to ban things
(55:49) though that I deem to be pornography within my preference can you tell me why that's wrong well you just said that literature including 50 Shades of gr
(55:54) would be I say that I didn't say 50 Shades pornography no I didn't you just made it
(55:59) up so anyway so back to this anything that I look at you know what else hang
(56:05) on you know what else is pornography Garfield Garfield's getting [ __ ] banned because that's in my preference
(56:10) that's pornography too so do you want to seriously engage now I am seriously engaging I'm explaining to you that if
(56:16) your if your reference is preference any preference I have has to be moral so there's no way for you to make a
(56:21) determination that me wanting to ban pornography based on completely arbitrary reasons is totally fine unless
(56:27) you can explain to me why it isn't uh s again you're arguing from the affirmative and you've completely failed
(56:33) to explain what those parameters even are okay here I'll give you the parameters from the affirmative porn should be banned because it's my
(56:39) preference okay so what is porn anything that I deemed in my preference to be
(56:45) pornography is pornography and you just said before so feet picks we can't post feet picks online anymore maybe some it
(56:51) depends on what what I see and then I'll know because it'll be in my preference okay so should we ban even like writings
(57:00) in books about giving oral sex some of them for sure I'm just not sure which ones you have to go Case by case like
(57:07) tell me a specif the Bible like Song of Songs when it talks about no of course not that wouldn't that wouldn't be a my
(57:12) preference oh okay so so we're accepting like some forms of literature erotica
(57:18) but not others anything that's in my preference is what porn
(57:23) is do you understand that you're can you tell me why I'm wrong
(57:29) honest can you tell me why I'm wrong you're being sorry intellectually dishonest why why you answer the question whole position you ready I'm
(57:35) looking for an argument though not another question give me a [ __ ] argument an actual argument I want porn
(57:41) band because it's against my preference can you give me a single [ __ ] argument for why that should not be the
(57:47) case because it violates people's personal autonomy and is that a preference of mine of my moral framework
(57:54) yes what's wrong with that I have a preference yours wrong with it because my preference is the ultimate Arbiter of
(58:00) all preferences okay based on a God that you can't prove exists no just based on me
(58:05) so can you be honest and and who cares if I can't even Pro even if I can't prove God and my whole preference is
(58:12) wrong I'm still the ultimate Arbiter of all things which are preferential so why is it can you answer the question I just
(58:18) answered it no you didn't okay what's the question what constitutes as pornography
(58:25) mhm whatever ever I say pornography is I want actual descriptions of what you think pornography is what I just gave
(58:31) you an actual why can you not Define it what I anything why such a hard question
(58:36) I just how does the Supreme Court Define it didn't a Supreme Court judge said I know it when I see it uh based on like the are you talking
(58:44) about the milites in terms of determining I'll know it when I see it
(58:49) and just like he said it's my preference same thing I'll know it when I see it and if it violates my preference it's
(58:56) [ __ ] immoral can you tell me why it is you describe what things would violate your personal preference oh yeah
(59:02) sure all all sorts of things like you being a prostitute violates my personal preference that should stop it's immoral
(59:08) okay um but you did say like some feet picks are okay right so I should be fine
(59:14) I don't I don't do PI my wife to me are fine oh okay so we can send like
(59:20) personal pornography and that's fine to your husband sure that's in my preference but you're for Banning
(59:28) pornography yeah ban yeah pornography would be bad unless the state finds out
(59:33) you're getting sent nudes from your wife should you only if only your wife sees your uh nudes no should you be punished
(59:41) fine by the law for privately sending nudes to your
(59:46) husband yes if pornography is banned no not to your husband so what policy
(59:52) exactly are you enacting which would ban pornography but not privately sent pornography oh well I'm glad that you
(59:58) asked so what I would do is I would make sure that all pornography which exists
(1:00:03) on any website which is accessible between strangers would be outlawed immediately and that all only fans would
(1:00:09) be shut down immediately that all public displays of nudity would be shut down
(1:00:15) immediately so are you saying to put pressure on these websites to take down
(1:00:20) porn or are you banning all the websites from us consumers no I'm saying that I will just use the government to walk in
(1:00:27) with machine guns and say porn is now banned all right and what's the problem
(1:00:34) do you have a single do you have a single argument why is fascism bad do you have a single argument for that
(1:00:40) because it violates people people's personal autonomy and why is that bad because we have a
(1:00:46) biological um need for our well-being so an appeal to
(1:00:53) Nature fallacy because because you think that we have a biological need for something for X that means it's moral to
(1:01:00) do X for instance a person may have biological need to have sex can they just take sex no no they can't can they so the
(1:01:08) thing is is like it's really interesting to me then I don't I don't actually understand your position at all I don't
(1:01:13) know what bad I think you do I think you're just being inred I want to know what bad means from your view because I
(1:01:19) don't even understand what you're asking me when you say bad what is bad why would you decide to take the affirmative
(1:01:25) on this and then refuse to answer any of my questions my position no you didn't you
(1:01:32) haven't even you haven't even def my preference is what is moral I'm going to
(1:01:37) ban pornography which is anything I think is pornography okay and what do
(1:01:42) you think is pornography that's the question I'm asking what do you think is pornography you know what here we'll just make it
(1:01:48) super easy anything that shows any nudity publicly is pornography including
(1:01:54) breastfeeding all of it it's all pornography Outlaw public breastfeeding as well sure
(1:02:00) sure okay what's wrong with that what's wrong with it can you tell me why it's bad eating on people's personal autonomy
(1:02:06) yeah why is that bad [ __ ] baby eating why why is that bad is that an actual opinion that you hold or youing yes why
(1:02:12) you want to B public can you tell me why it's [ __ ] bad please I just did wait do you have hearing difficulties yeah I
(1:02:18) do when you say it's bad because it's bad because it's bad when you say when I say why I said it's bad because it violates people's personal me but why is
(1:02:25) that bad again because that is like a violation of people's well-being yeah
(1:02:33) but why would it be bad to violate people's wellbe because it results in suffering okay and why is suffering
(1:02:40) bad because we don't want to suffer oh is it bad because it's bad suffering is intrinsically bad yes
(1:02:48) it's bad because it's bad yes suffering is intrinsically bad so it's bad because it's bad and pleasure is intrinsically
(1:02:55) good okay well I say Banning porn's intrinsically good it's good cuz it's good okay and you still can't even Define what pornography is don't need to
(1:03:01) it's good CU it's good well I think you do because you're the one um supposing that we ban pornography yeah I already
(1:03:08) told you all public displays of nudity regardless of circumstance I'm call what
(1:03:14) do you mean by public anytime any is Pornhub public out in out in front of strangers is Pornhub
(1:03:21) public yeah I consider that public okay yeah so PornHub goes gota so
(1:03:29) you understand that this means that the porn industry would just go completely underground into a black market where
(1:03:34) people are they can't when I drives they can't when I send soldiers in there with machine guns can they and in your world
(1:03:40) no wait but in your worldview you said it's public displays of pornography that are not allowed so privately trading
(1:03:46) USBS would be fine in your worldview no no if you're privately doing it then that's up to the public right what do
(1:03:53) you mean yeah so like if if you and I what do you think a public exchange is
(1:03:59) if I go over to a merchant who's in a building and nobody can see and we make a transaction you're saying that's not a public transaction can you answer my
(1:04:05) question I just did that would be a public transaction exchanges between people even if they're done behind closed doors still public transactions I
(1:04:12) don't know what you're talking sending a nude to your wife isn't public no that's private
(1:04:17) yeah okay so what if you do it in a public space
(1:04:23) like how you just describe the the sto like if you if you and your wife send
(1:04:28) each other nudes yeah that yeah that would be private okay but privately sending a USB
(1:04:36) isn't privately sending a USB to who okay well let's this girl is so dense
(1:04:41) she doesn't understand the difference between sending pictures between a husband and a
(1:04:46) wife and secretly buying corn on a hard a hard drive or USB stick producing the
(1:04:53) material on the hard drive would still consider meeting in public it would still consider publicly meeting and
(1:04:59) Gathering and then selling it to someone else is still a public transaction where areas if a husband and wife are just
(1:05:05) sending pictures back and forth to each other it's only going to be seen between them now if that husband or that wife
(1:05:12) decided to then start selling the pictures of their husband or their wife to other people well then yes that would
(1:05:17) be bad but if it just stays between them that's perfectly fine however going and
(1:05:22) secretly buying horn from someone that's still public because it still
(1:05:28) involves other people it still involves the public how does she not understand this who Let's ignore the USB privately
(1:05:35) sending it online on a black market let's do it that way to who to anyone it's private that would be porn unless
(1:05:41) it's to your husband wait what I don't think you understand saying Makey pictures to
(1:05:48) strangers for [ __ ] money it's porn Okay so the issue is not whether it's
(1:05:53) public or private it's if you're married to them or not oh that would be if you're doing something which is against
(1:05:59) the law in this case exchanging pornography with strangers still publicly trading something it's just
(1:06:04) that uh you're trying to hide it but you're still open for business it's against the law and you're going to
(1:06:10) [ __ ] jail so if I privately share a nude to a stranger is that fine if you
(1:06:15) want a better definition right South Korea great I would love it okay sure South Korea has ban pornography right so
(1:06:22) pull up whatever the South Korean definition of porn is and I'm going to ban whatever that
(1:06:28) is okay now can you answer my question I just did uh no you didn't so if I
(1:06:33) privately send a nude to a stranger is that F yeah you're going to jail this woman thought she was going to go in
(1:06:39) there and totally School Andrew Wilson she totally makes assumptions and and she keeps saying it's mass human
(1:06:45) suffering keep in mind she's arguing to keep corn around and Andrew Wilson wanting to ban
(1:06:53) that that's going to lead to Mass suffering in her part she Compares taking away corn to Noah's Ark that's
(1:07:01) why these people get called cumers and goers is because to them taking away
(1:07:06) this stuff is is is doing Mass harm it's it's harmful you can't take it away it's
(1:07:12) the same way as when you try to take away drugs from a drug addict if you take away drugs from a drug addict to
(1:07:18) them you are doing them harm you are causing them pain and these gooners and cumers when you talk about banning corn
(1:07:25) they talk talk about it the same way as a drug adct takes away drugs and then they want to come and argue that corn is
(1:07:32) actually not harmful well I disagree look how you act when we want to take it away clearly this woman she makes money
(1:07:40) off of doing this stuff she makes money from it so she doesn't want to take her sweet money source and I don't blame her
(1:07:46) by the way it seems like she doesn't have a very high IQ seems like she doesn't have she said she's not very
(1:07:52) smart seems like she's never had a deep thought in her life and so yeah totally get why she's arguing the uh the side of
(1:07:58) keeping it around because without it what does she have left what can she do that's why it's important to teach your
(1:08:04) children young to be smart and resourceful because if you don't you get girls like this this was a great debate
(1:08:12) and highly entertaining debate by Andrew Wilson by the way this full debate is like five hours long that's why I'm not
(1:08:17) doing the whole thing but if you want to see the whole um debate for yourself
(1:08:23) it's on modernday debate just look up modern day debate in the search bar uh you'll find the channel
