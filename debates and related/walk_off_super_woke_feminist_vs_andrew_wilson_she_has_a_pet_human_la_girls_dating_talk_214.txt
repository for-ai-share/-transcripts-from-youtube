(14:52) Andrew what about you yeah my name is Andrew Wilson I'm the host of The Crucible it's a popular
(14:58) entertainment Channel on YouTube I'm a political analyst political sist I enjoy doing conversations debates of all types
(15:05) and um glad to have this conversation with your girls today all right uh so going around the
(15:12) table once more what is everybody's current relationship status
(15:17) so are you single talking stage situationship married whatever it is if you're single how long have you been
() 
(15:23) single and what's the longest relationship you've ever been in go ahead I'm in the process of getting div
(15:29) dived um that was my longest relationship 5 years um yeah
(15:36) single uh so how long have you guys been
(15:42) separated 4 months all right have you dated since then um I've talked to a couple people
(15:52) um but I mean nothing really profound feel like I'm more interested
(15:59) in getting divorced before I'm ready to go into another relationship was it an open marriage we were polyamorous mhm so
(16:07) under that blanket who um who wanted the polyamorous aspect of the relationship
() 
(16:14) and did it start that way um so I was the one that petitioned for
(16:19) polyamory um it didn't start that way um but prior to that um my previous two
(16:26) relationships were polyamorous relationships um when we got together it was shortly
(16:31) after I had been sexually assaulted by a man so I wasn't in a position to be with really more than one person um but with
(16:39) a lot of therapy and help um I remembered who I was and also I'm Queer
(16:45) as [ __ ] so wait Queer as [ __ ] as [ __ ] as [ __ ] okay what's the difference between
(16:51) queer and then Queer As [ __ ] um I would say I lean more towards being queer than
(16:58) like towards men what's the difference between polyamorous and an open
(17:03) relationship I mean they're essentially the same thing an open relationship is you know you have other romantic and
(17:11) sexual partners um polymerus say you actually are having other relationships
(17:16) so it's like a defined relationship like boyfriend girlfriend partner um and you love them so it's more than just like
(17:23) sexual were you sleeping with were you sleeping with other men as well as women though yes yeah yeah okay okay so during
(17:31) the course of your marriage you were sleeping with other people your part your boy husb husband he was also
(17:38) sleeping with other people okay um but you asked to open it up was there any
(17:43) push back initially or um I mean initially yes because he
(17:49) was asking you know kind of like how did this come about and you know when I
(17:54) explained like well this is who I was he said well I thought that when we got got together it was just going to be us but
(18:01) um ultimately like he wanted it to um and he wanted to experience different
(18:07) people so um I was all for it well if
(18:12) I'm I'm just curious um so if if he wanted it then how come you were the one who brought it
(18:19) up well I mean everything is just a conversation right a conversation for discussion so if something's not
(18:26) happening and it's like well what would this be like or you know like I'm sure you ask your
(18:31) partner a million questions in a day like what do you think about this so yeah um also because I am queer I mean I
(18:39) wanted to be with women and he isn't yeah but you were also with other men right yes yeah so I mean that's that's
(18:47) usually a sticking point for men uh generally speaking I think on the polyamorous front I've talked to some
(18:53) men who if their you know their girl or wife or whatever is exclusively with
(18:59) other women they seem to not mind that nearly as much as if they're with other men that seems to be the like big
(19:05) sticking point right so I don't I was I was just
(19:10) curious I mean I think it's fair if you're you know in an open relationship
(19:15) or polyamorous if you should be allowed to pursue 100% of people that you find
(19:21) attractive you know and then obviously if someone agrees you know to parameters and boundaries in that that's fine as
(19:27) long as it's ethical um we just agreed that it was fine so I just have one more
(19:32) brief question I'll turn it back over to Brian um just wondering your take what is the purpose of getting married if you
(19:39) want to be in a polyamorous relationship um I mean we had a daughter
(19:46) we have a daughter um you know I wanted a family but um I also wanted to
(19:52) continue to be with women and um I have a lot of love to give well wait wait and
(19:57) Men right I don't know like it it seems like there's such a pivot here he's just like I just want to be with other women
(20:03) it's like but no no men right yeah I guess I should say other people yeah
(20:09) other people okay that makes more sense so um so yeah I'm not like if you if the
(20:15) purpose was family right the idea here is you wanted to have a family uh I
(20:20) don't see why you couldn't do that same exact thing that you were doing absent the
(20:26) marriage um I mean I've just never never been in a long-term monogamous relationship personally so I mean no
(20:34) shame to people that want to do that I think whatever floats your boat whatever makes you happy um we just agreed that
(20:40) you know that was the relationship structure of our marriage and it was ethical and we were okay with it so yeah
(20:47) no I I understand all that I'm just I'm just curious as to what the actual purpose of the marriage part is like so
(20:53) you could do all of that absent marriage right like you could still have the daughter you can still have the guy you can still have the you know you can do
(21:00) all that minus so I don't actually understand the purpose of the marriage
(21:06) aspect um I mean we wanted to be married so think gotri the the license part of
(21:13) it like having a business with your partner basically when you get married it's like a business or a license you're signing away yeah I mean um well he
(21:22) proposed to you right yeah so like you weren't pushing for marriage he W he just proposed out the no I mean we we
(21:29) talked about it we talked about you know wanting to get married um and you know
(21:35) having children and these things so I think also for me I see now in retrospect I feel like I was just
(21:41) following a relationship escalator you know society says this is what a relationship is you meet someone and you
(21:47) guys fall in love and then you get engaged and then you get the house and then you get the dogs and then you get the baby and then you're married you
(21:54) know were you Paulie before you got married with this guy yeah
(21:59) yes couple questions here okay so let's do a bit of a timeline you guys were married for how long um three years and together for
(22:08) five yes total okay so you met him it's started out monogamous is that correct
(22:14) correct okay how soon into the Rel uh relationship did you want to open it up
(22:21) I would say after a year after one year so this is prior to you guys being married correct okay and uh huh cuz you
(22:32) said this is who I've always been did you had you not disclosed to him during
(22:37) the like that you were pully no I mean I
(22:42) disclosed it I mean you just asked if there was any push back and I I expressed you know there was just I
(22:48) guess some confusion on his end why why did you accept monogamy to begin with I mean you that's what happened right I
(22:55) mean it wasn't me accepting it I think you know you just see someone you like them you guys continue seeing each other
(23:02) I'm not really sure what's so crazy about that it's not like well you how long was it exclusive for you said a
(23:07) year mhm but you're polyamor why did you I explained I was sexually assaulted by
(23:13) a man prior to meeting him so I had to go to a lot of therapy for that oh he was like he was
(23:20) like a stable safe place for you I loved him yeah well I mean I I understand that
(23:27) but yeah he he help that there was like this this prior event that happened which obviously is horrible right sorry
(23:34) that that happened to you but um but but is were you looking at this guy as kind of a rock right or something that was
(23:41) very stable uh because this event because you seem to tie these two events together well no you guys keep asking me
(23:49) specifically like you know why did you decide after a year so I explained I had
(23:55) to go to therapy you know I had to work on myself I had to become confident again find my voice do all these things
(24:02) and then you know remembered who I was the do you think that the therapy assisted in your decision to move to a
(24:09) polyamorous relationship in your marriage no my therapy didn't decide
(24:15) that no not decided did did it assist because you said you were using the therapy to find yourself and get back
(24:22) into who you are this kind of thing so did the therapy actually assist you into
(24:28) the self-discovery aspect that you are indeed polyamorist yes okay I see but you have
(24:36) been in uh polyamorous relationships before
(24:41) right yes okay but we just have audio people listening just audio so if you
(24:46) just shake your head so you can conf you just got to say yes no whatever um all
(24:52) right so what about you I've only been in one relationship and it's been for 5 years we're still going very
(24:59) strong all right is it your only relationship or yes okay relationship 5 years all right what about you well I
(25:07) just broke up with my ex-boyfriend I was with them since I was 17 years old we were together consistently for 4 years I
(25:14) broke up with him I turned 21 cuz he was like very toxic very controlling and so
(25:20) I took a year um off and he flew out a girl from Oregon and started living with her and um then he started trying to
(25:27) talk to me again to get back back together while the girl was still living at his house and I had no idea I thought
(25:32) he was just were going to get back together and so anyways they end up breaking up and I end up coming back to
(25:38) his house and living with him and starting over again and then I just broke up with him recently again at 23
(25:43) CU how long was the break the break was a year one year okay one year who uh who wanted the break I wanted the Break um
() 
(25:51) he kind of cut my hair um yeah when I was sleeping and so what yeah no we need
(25:57) more details on that's not something you just what do you mean he cut your hair yeah so what happened like he had very bad mental health issues and very
(26:04) controlling very cuz nobody just freaking cut somebody hair no and I've been nothing but get to him he was my
(26:09) first relationship since I was 17 years old and before that my parents never let me date so I was just like perfectly
(26:15) pure innocent and I wanted a serious relationship and so I was like the third
(26:20) girl that he had like moved in with he was 20 years old at the time and I was 17 2 months before I turned 18 so not
(26:25) that weird and also like older guys too so yeah everything was good and fast
(26:31) forward um when the during the break he when he was living with the girl I was
(26:37) um trying to move on cuz my man's with somebody else you know moving on so I downloaded hinge started talking the
(26:44) guys flirting on Snapchat sending like like cute like like pictures and stuff
(26:49) like that you know and so I didn't think about deleting any of my old previous
(26:55) like like guys I was talking to on and so so one day we went out to the bar while we're like still trying to talk
(27:00) and get back together we didn't fire anything it was amazing we went back home he invited friends over and I just
(27:07) got completely blacked out drunk cuz I felt I felt safe with him it was like my safe place since I was 17 years old so I go upstairs I passed out my hair was so
(27:13) long at the time and he somehow got into my phone when I was sleeping and he was
(27:19) on drugs like not drug like blow or whatever and drinking alcohol and so he was blacked out and he got into my phone
(27:25) and like saw all my previous messages that I was talking to when he was dating that girl and somehow he got really
(27:31) jealous and enraged that I was doing that when he was it it it makes no sense it's like as I'm saying mental illness
(27:38) and so he decided to cut my hair when I was passed out blacked out drunk how much did he cut he gave me like a little
(27:43) mullet I have like a picture of my phone he like cut the top layer he gave you a mullet kind of like a mullet he let me
(27:49) like the long my long hair down and like the top layer of my hair just like Jagged it up that's awesome and yes I
(27:56) was I did nothing I did nothing to this man I've been nothing but loyal to this man bought him

(28:35) one second one second so I mean you say you're nothing but loyal but I mean you dumped the guy right yeah because he was
(28:40) controlling and and like holding me back and wouldn't let me be who I needed who I knew I needed to be in my life well I
(28:46) mean but that doesn't sound like nothing but loyal wait me or him bro Andrew hold
(28:51) on are you really defending somebody who cut somebody's hair off in her sleep he cut her hair this was before he cut the
(28:58) hair though so wait well I'm confused now the second time yeah the second time
(29:05) we broke up and we got back together the second time I get it I get it what I'm saying though is that before this
(29:11) happened before all this happened you said well I was nothing I'm nothing but loyal this and that it's like well stand
(29:16) by that hang on hang on that it's not re me if you dumped him that's not nothing but loyal yeah I can't be with the man
(29:22) who cut my hair I don't want to brag to my kids like oh yeah your dad back in our 20s cut my hair didn't you dump him
(29:27) before he cut your hair yes because he was controlling and toxic I was trying to give him another chance I believe in second chances so okay but hang hang on
(29:34) hang on let's back up let's back up I don't understand how you can say though uh well I can't be with someone who cut
(29:40) my hair it's like what you dumped him before you he cut your hair I don't I wait Andrew I got let me just look this
(29:46) is very rare for me to Andrew are you saying that if you break up with somebody airo you are not
(29:52) loyal like there's no seriously I'm just trying to understand the position date someone forever to be loyal to them well hang on hang on on what I I don't
(29:59) understand what does loyalty mean not Che on people you're Loy chill chill chill out just calmay around with other
(30:06) other people only hear one person at a time I can only hear one person at a time go ahead for me being loyal is you
(30:13) and your partner are two team deal you're not bringing any third person you're um loyal to each other love each
(30:20) other and respect each other and you're not looking for other people's um to
(30:25) sleep around with is that loyalty girls yeah it's true okay so that's like so
(30:31) you're say okay so he not talking to other people like not he was cheating on you before you dumped him no he wasn't
(30:37) I've never got Che on I I still don't understand like if the idea here is he
(30:42) was controlling abusive he was mentally physically verbally hang on I get all
(30:48) that I understand but what what was he doing which was abusive what's Abus what
(30:53) does that mean um mentally like Tearing Me Down
(30:58) um verbally abusing me and physically like what's an example of that dumb
(31:03) [ __ ] for no reason like and telling me I'm like not going to amount to anything in life and just like you know trying to
(31:10) tear me down as a person saying he's the best thing I can get when it's not true and um I want to know why you went
(31:17) back because he was my first love that but the way he's treating you is no I know but a lot of a lot of people girls
(31:23) get beat up black and blue and still stay with their man don't go back it was my my mistake I'm not going back a third
(31:28) time you learned I'm learning I learned not no maybe took me him cutting my hair I
(31:33) had to learn the hard way I think there's something like domestic violence survivors go back seven or eight times
(31:39) before they either leave or get killed by their person so yeah I think good that you got out
(31:46) now and your hair looks great and hope keep going you know yeah no it was very traumatic for me cuz I did love the guy
(31:51) he was and I was planning on marrying him and I were talking about forever and to settle with somebody and be with
(31:58) forever like you have to be okay with everything you know like you don't want to find anybody else you're just okay with that person and that's how I felt
(32:03) with him but then after the year six years and everything he's been doing to me I was like I can't be with somebody
(32:09) like that you should put n in his shampoo and make him prematurely bald oh that's a good idea I should have
(32:16) probably shouldn't do that but now I'm single and like I said I wasted six years of my life not wasted it was
(32:21) experience and um now I'm trying to like get gain those six years back and just focus on myself somebody comes along
(32:28) that meets all my requirements because I'm very picky very selective yeah when's the last time you talked to him
(32:34) um last time I talked to him was like um we blocked each other on everything okay you've been you've been single for how
(32:40) long for well actually I spoken with like recently so like September when I left his house for good so two months
(32:48) two months ago I moved to LA when's the last time you talked to him um during that time you haven't talked to him for
(32:54) 2 months mhm okay last time you saw him in person two months ago too his house when I and so the total length of the
(33:00) relationship was 6 years 6 years including 2018 including the one-ear break is that correct so um from 2018
(33:09) till I turned 21 that was four years consistently and then we had a one-ear break and then all together getting back
(33:16) together we've been with each other like six years like messing around and like talking so
(33:21) okay uh there's a lot there um a lot I'm a little rundown right now you broke up
(33:27) with him the so you broke up with him the first time yes and the second time okay and there was a year break but he
(33:32) didn't cheat on me U from me breaking up with him he was just like not a good guy and I thought I can like who went back
(33:38) to who like did you reach back out to him we both played the um reaching back
(33:44) to each other first he would call me a no color ID and then I would ignore him and then I'll answer it and it was like playing Team tag calling cuz then he
(33:50) would call me every day then he would stop calling me so I'd be like why aren't you calling me so then I would call him back and then finally we um
(33:57) started the girl left back to Oregon and yeah we started talking again cuz I do
(34:03) not want to be the other woman and I do not all right you've been single for two months any other guys in the picture any rebound no well I have a couple um
(34:10) candidates that I think would be good but at this moment in time I'm not looking for a relationship when you say a couple candidates what do you mean um
(34:16) like good like good guys that I would probably give them a chance to um dat
(34:22) have you been on a date with any of these guys no I haven't I haven't been dating how do you know them um Instagram
(34:28) and like parties and events I've seen them at you knew them prior to the breakup with your current or
(34:33) ex-boyfriend no okay so like recently they all just materialized you have a
(34:39) couple candidates that you've never met but they only materialized after the breakup
(34:45) yeah okay and they just dm'd you on Instagram mhm how many DMS do you get per day um about
(34:52) like 15 to 20 but I'm so not active on my you get 15 to 20 DM from men per day

() 
(35:45) maybe like one a day if I'm being honest not really any that much okay M honestly
(35:52) it just depends like if I'm active then obviously like a lot of people are going to like slide up
(35:58) the end go well if I post a picture I get like bro like what are you talking about yeah like if you post like you'll
(36:05) get like you know random guys too I've never even seen in my life average average over the course of a year
(36:10) average like every day like per day per day yeah if you had average day I mean if I don't post I'm not getting any
(36:16) slide ups but if I post like you know like it could be anything like posted the past year yeah but like okay per day

(36:31) you say like 15 to 20 I close pretty often 15 to 20 DMS from men per day M
(36:37) okay what about you like no comment um um um I would say
(36:44) um without posting which I don't do very often as much as I should uh probably like
(36:49) seven okay consistent every day all right what about you um I just you're
(36:55) too far from the mic Facebook and Instagram I don't care any DM okay Deborah what about you I don't check my
(37:01) DMs that much I'm sorry everybody I love you guys but if you if you were to when I do the occasional scroll down to just
(37:07) see if like I don't know Elon Musk is like hey I don't know you know not that purpose business reason business stuff
(37:16) um Pro like I do want to point out that I don't get often like gross DMS from
(37:21) guys I get usually like really nice like hey I'd love to take you for dinner like I already told my mom about us like
(37:27) things like that so thankfully they're not sleazy but I would say probably about like between 20 to 50 a day 20 to
(37:36) 50 oh Deborah from you Brian oh uh 20 to 50 per day all my pretty
(37:43) active I like on Instagram especially and like Twitter lately I've been getting like upwards of like 30 to 50
(37:50) million views a month so it's been a lot of people who may want to talk to me and you mentioned uh Elon Musk would if he
(37:57) did slide into your DMs would you date Elon I would not unfortunately he's too old for me but he did repost me on X two
(38:04) weeks ago so you want to keep reposting me or give me a Tesla thank you all
(38:10) right uh cool there you go um that's really interesting so it was uh five I
(38:17) think 5515 no you're 15 to 20 right seven the
(38:23) Snapchat count and then oh yeah Snapchat damn that's a lot too that that I can't even count yeah I mean this is CRA I
(38:31) mean look I I know that this is the case for a lot of women but uh the sexual option the sexual optionality that like
(38:39) the average woman gets maybe some of you aren't average but probably most of you are um no offense
(38:47) uh you guys have the same sexual pull as like aess celebrities that are male aess
(38:54) celebrities mus famous musicians top tier musicians professional
(38:59) athletes it's just interesting to not but anyways moving on with the
(39:05) relationship status what about you um I'm in a committed fory your relationship all right how did you guys
(39:11) meet um we actually met in high school in in I think 11th grade yeah in 11th
(39:18) grade all right cool love story yeah and that's your longest that's your longest relationship um my last relationship
(39:26) longest my long it was the same it was four years you had so you had another four yearold but we were like kids so I
(39:33) don't really like count it you know who broke up with who that one I did okay what about you I've been single for the
(39:39) past four months all right uh longest relationship
(39:45) two years two years who broke up with who he broke up with me was that the one
(39:50) that ended four months ago mhm okay why did he break up with you um I had like
(39:55) some unhealed Trauma from my ex that I brought the baggage like into our relationship a lot of trust issues um
(40:03) you know it's two entertainers dating each other so we had to deal with that sure okay uh so you've been single for
(40:10) four months uh any rebound or anything like that um I'm still like trying to work
(40:17) things out with him like trying to heal for myself but also like hopefully to attract him back in like a healthier way
(40:24) um but amongst that I've kind of been like see being other people it's been teaching me some new experiences do you
(40:31) have a roster currently of course what how big is the roster um I like to keep
(40:36) my options I like quality over quantity so right now like two okay and are you to
(40:44) five sorry what it depends on what four seriously
(40:50) like two but so it's not a roster it's like a starting five yeah yeah we got we got like exactly starting six maybe and
(40:58) have you healed the trauma that was causing you so much trouble well the
(41:03) more people I encounter sometimes it makes me realize like maybe I was the crazy one and like I need to kind
(41:10) of chill out when you say you were the crazy one
(41:16) so what's what conduct uh were you doing that was crazy just just a girl on her
(41:24) little FBI investigation stuff um you know I didn't like seeing him up
(41:30) under Every Girl's pictures liked by so and so or when guys don't want to see me
(41:35) in the club but their following looks like the entire list of girls from the club so stuff like that I would check
(41:41) his following I would see when it goes up I'd see who he's commenting under i'
(41:46) check his location yeah and I had a lot of time throughout the day we lived together too so I was like on him for
(41:53) everything I tried to not check his phone for the longest because I knew that's what made made me crazy in my past relationship but sometimes a past
(42:00) code slips into my peripheral and you know this leads to that and I'm I'm really trying to work on it I know
(42:07) that's some bagg I need to heal a couple times a few times was was was that
(42:12) behavior due to unhealed drama yeah from being cheated on in my past and also
(42:18) like going back to them and stuff so how soon into the relationship did you start looking at this phone um before we even
(42:24) got into an actual relationship yeah yeah so like a week in oh oh sorry
(42:30) looking at his phone sorry I thought you said his following his following I did early the phone wasn't until like a year
(42:36) into us living together okay so how many different times did you check his phone um maybe like twice cuz the first time I
(42:43) didn't see anything I was like that can't be right so I checked it a second time and I'm like okay maybe he is actually clean I think it's a negative
(42:50) feedback loop that this is like a very common thing that people deal with in relationships on the male and female
(42:55) side that when women aren't secure in relationship ship it makes them us crazy and girls start doing things like that
(43:01) but then also when you do things like that it pushes away any chance of normaly and this is just a product of
(43:07) modern dating and like the issues that and I think it's the reason that people aren't entering relationships and they're not finding their Happy Ever
(43:12) After and it's sad and hopefully we can just move past this whole like social
(43:18) media stage did you uh tell him that you went through his phone uh yeah I did cuz I was like why
(43:24) did you like her entire story highlight you said I didn't have to to worry about this coworker I knew y'all were [ __ ] I just went in and he almost moved out
(43:31) and we had to call my parents and talk about it and um yeah
(43:37) so so you so you went crazy on this guy I I tried not to I was like watching him
(43:42) sleep I couldn't I was like no I got to wake him up I couldn't what I was ruting
(43:48) in my thoughts you watched him sleep cuz I was like should I wake him up like is it really
(43:54) that wake his ass up who is this who is this wait what you so but why were you
(44:02) watching him sleep no should be dreaming about repeat sorry
(44:09) again I was just deciding whether or not to wake him up like should I act down and crash out or no wait what do you mean wake him up for what because I
(44:16) wanted to know I had been having my suspicions about his like shift lead at work he would work like overtime all of
(44:24) a sudden at like a nurser like a senior yeah for a year so
(44:30) he so he was working hard well so he started taking overtime shifts and um
(44:38) started following his coworker on Instagram but you guys live together so why would you be watching him couldn't
(44:44) you just talk to him when he before he went to bed I did so I like drove his car and I saw a footprint um I thought I
(44:50) saw a footprint in the windshield and I was like whose footprint is that like are y'all [ __ ] on your lunch break or
(44:55) something like is is this your [ __ ] your mind just keeps on going I literally like measured it cuz I was like is this
(45:02) your footprint or is this a female's footprint I was your lawyer I'd be like
(45:08) girl you know I just we're getting into legal Terr so at what point during all
(45:14) of this did you manage to put the cuckoo back in the clock um still working on that so we're
(45:23) okay yeah so how early into the relation ship were you uh looking at his
(45:29) following list like immediately like the first week cuz he's a model like he's on set with other models he's an aspiring
(45:36) actor I like can't fathom all the female co-stars and stuff he meets on a daily
(45:43) how uh were you guys like exclusive right away pretty much or pretty much it was kind of the sense that like oh I'm
(45:49) telling my guy friends like you're my girlfriend and stuff like that and I'm like okay let's wait to make it official but we know we're exclusive you know how
(45:56) soon did you guys move in with each other after a year of being together okay after a year and was that a pushed
(46:02) by you or by him or my grandpa had passed away so my mom was going to move back with my grandma and then I just had
(46:09) like a whole house with empty rooms had to find some roommates so it was kind of like last minute but it's something that
(46:14) we had planned anyway to move in together did you charge him rent yeah like he ain't about to live rent
(46:20) free market fair market value or uh we had the master bedroom so we paid the most like out of the house it yeah all
(46:28) right and uh let's see so uh what was his reaction because you
(46:35) like you told him You' check his phone and then you'd tell him afterwards right cuz you felt guilty or you still wanted
(46:42) to confront him about nothing um well I mean he had followed his coworker let's
(46:49) say in January 2024 so why did he like all of her entire gym highlight from
() 
(46:56) 2022 little photos of her and her tight little leggings her booty progress
(47:01) photos when she he could have liked any other story of maybe like her going out to eat at restaurants or her traveling
(47:07) but no he specifically only likes the one of her gym highlights now had you uh had a conversation with him prior to
(47:13) this happening that you are uncomfortable with him liking or following yes okay you and what did he
(47:18) say to that um he said that he would stop he wouldn't do anything that doesn't align with a relationship okay
(47:24) and then I'd like to investigate a little bit of your conduct in the relationship he so he was totally
(47:30) reasonable um as far as doing things publicly I didn't like when he was commenting like fire emojis under photos
(47:37) of girls in lingerie and I'm like that doesn't look good reflecting on our relationship you know you just need to
(47:42) respect our relationship now let's um I I do I would like to uh investigate a
(47:48) bit of your conduct here though you mentioned that you would be going out to the bar bars and clubs correct mhm and
(47:55) would uh you also do modeling is that correct or more like freelance not like
(48:00) signed uh you have your public Instagram though would you be posting revealing photos on your Instagram yes and he
(48:06) would as well of himself yeah like I think it's totally different between men and women on this uh well we went around
(48:13) the table and all of you said that you guys get 5 15 20 you get 15 20 DMS per day by men women don't really at least
(48:21) at the same uh frequency slide into men's DMS and in fact we can test this
(48:26) right now um how many DMS do you guys slide into I do it how let's just do how
(48:32) many DMS hold on how many total DMS have you ever sent to a man on Instagram
(48:38) displaying some sort of romantic not just like I one guy go ahead what about you how many DMS have you sent in your
(48:45) entire
(48:52) life it's a tough one I mean less than five I'd say less than five what about you just my
(48:58) boyfriend zero okay maybe three oh you slid into your boyfriend's DM well
(49:03) always every time he Post Yeah you mean like otherwise or that's
(49:09) not how you met though you didn't slide that's not how you met correct oh initiate no we met through school okay
(49:14) all right what about you how many DMS have you sent out at least like maybe three guys I can remember remember to okay what about you zero zero how about
(49:21) you how many DMS have you sent three three 12 12 okay what about you yeah none really none what about you damn I
(49:29) believe in getting what you want and asking for what you want I've definitely slid into she handful of men's yeah Ryan
(49:37) a handful of men's DMS um and one of them worked out I ended up like going on
(49:43) dates with him later on in life and I'm how many how many though how many in total yeah I don't know how many came to
(49:50) fruition but like at least 10 they didn't yeah at least 10 at least 10 at
(49:56) least 10 okay um and then I'm pretty sure like that to be honest I'd rather
(50:02) go hunt down who I want than have them come to me like I like that to but in any case in person though every single
(50:09) girl here has received orders of magnitude more DMS than you've sent out so this is why this just to explain the
(50:15) differential here like the amount of sexual Pursuit and intention that you guys get as women is totally different
(50:22) so like if you as a girl you post a revealing photo that's like actually
(50:27) advertising whereas when a man does that post say revealing photo like what he posts a shirtless pick mind you he's
(50:33) also oh a gym he's also a model correct so that's also in addition to that within the purview of his profession
(50:41) um massive differential I do want to point out though that like when I have slid into these men's DMS it's for hopes
(50:47) of like going on a date with them or thinking that they're like a standup guy that can maybe be my future husband whereas the DMS that I receive I'm sure
(50:54) at least half of them are people who just would want to have sex or things of that nature or just for the sake of like oh I took her out stuff
(51:01) so obviously I can't I want to give the benefit of the doubt to the male followers that are messaging me but I
(51:06) don't know what their actual intentions are whereas I know all of those 10 at least have been like genuine relationship intentions I can't say the
(51:13) same for the other ones necessarily yeah I mean I'd be willing to Grant to you that it's probably more likely that a man's intentions but my uh more men
(51:21) men's intentions but might be more casual in nature but I wouldn't be surprised I mean even admitted earlier
(51:27) that uh most of the DMS you have received have been fairly polite I wouldn't be surprised and also just
(51:32) given probably I assume the men who are interested in you probably lean a bit more conservative which would indicate to me that they're probably a bit more
(51:39) interested in long-term relationship as opposed to like some soy boy who's just trying to [ __ ] you because that's what soy boys do I guess
(51:46) I don't know they're not really they don't even get women soy boys well that's probably also true so um they get other men but in any case I do think
(51:52) there's a difference like if a guy post a photo on Instagram it's not going to elicit the same level of attention that
(51:59) a woman posting a revealing a photo will receive but um post one and let's see Brian Let's test it I mean bust the
(52:06) thong out like the The Little Gym thirst trap like you guys like to do the Borat
(52:14) man is coming um so okay uh going back to you though you were uh what was it
(52:21) you were posting uh you were posting revealing photos on Instagram like photos of me at the beach and a bikini
(52:27) not like R lingerie photos it's a girl can't be at the beach on myag a guy
(52:32) can't like his coworker's Instagram like you have to that's my way of sliding into guy DMS that's why I took it as
(52:39) disrespectful cuz I'll like I'll like a guy's story if I think he's looking cute
(52:44) go as far as like messaging them so I felt like to him that was him showing
(52:49) him him showing extra love to his coworker that didn't need to be shown when she has already
(52:56) did you go to bars find you attractive what was that do you go to bars and clubs yeah because promoters like um pay
(53:02) me they like bring out girls and we'll pay you so money opportunity for so if
(53:08) um if a you live in Los Angeles right Orange County okay you're close enough so if somebody like a hey can you guys
(53:15) shut the [ __ ] up please thank you guys we told you before the show you can't be doing sidebar conversations what can we
(53:21) can't get up to get something no you can go to the bathroom goe that's what I was asking her cuz I'm like falling asleep I need like some energy that's I was
(53:27) asking like one at a time yeah there's a there's energy shots back there but kindly don't speak sorry as instructed I
(53:33) just didn't know if we could get up yeah you can get up that's totally fine you can use the bathroom you can get an enery shot before I was interrupted uh
() 
(53:41) it so you said because you're do you want to get up y get up in a second all right
(53:47) so you were saying that you go out to the bars and clubs because you were
(53:52) being paid right so if a porn produc producer reached out to you and offered to pay you to shoot a porn wouldn't your
(54:00) boyfriend have an issue with that okay it's different though I'm getting paid to sit in a section like a secluded VIP
(54:06) section where I'm not even on the dance floor or at the bar with guys I'm literally getting drinks to my table I'm
(54:12) in a section with just me and my girls they'd rather me bring girls out to a club than guys so it's not like I'm
(54:17) surrounded by girls there that's a club promoter they want to have girls in the club how do they make money at the
(54:24) club well the girls bring the guys in and the guys pay for sections and bottles and drinks the club why so but
(54:32) okay let's let's examine that why do they even pay to have women
(54:38) show up at these clubs it's for appeal appeal to who to
(54:44) Their audience it could be ladies spending money on bottles to so women go to bars to to hit on other women are you
(54:52) going were you I've been hit on by women at bars yeah you also get hit on by Men At bars yes but I keep it respectful because I'm
(54:58) in a relationship I'm not the type to go out give out my number go like their stories on so did he tell you he doesn't
(55:04) want you going out to bars and clubs um he just doesn't want me to extend the
(55:09) connection further than the clubs like don't try to give them your number or connect with them on Instagram but you were still basically
(55:16) how often would you go out to uh bars and clubs like bi-weekly monthly TW wait
(55:21) so twice a week or twice a month once every two weeks or like like once a
(55:27) month it depends on how often they reach out to me okay and it sounded like so did he have
(55:35) issues with you going out to these bars and clubs um he would make his little jokes
(55:40) about like me wearing revealing stuff or going out with my single girlfriends who might influence me to do single things
(55:48) so he didn't want you to do that yeah but you did it anyways he never said explicitly don't go to clubs and bars he
(55:53) just said giving them your number why I don't understand he says he doesn't like it why does he then need to actually
(56:00) articulate I because he would go out to the bars with his boys and I had to be okay with it I wouldn't have to stop him
(56:06) from that but what I wouldn't want him to go do is go to the bar with his cooworker that I think he's flirting with you know I'm going out with my
(56:13) girlfriends if he's going out with his guy friends it's fine it depends on who you're going out with yeah but again this this comes back to the differential
() 
(56:20) between men and women so as a guy if you go to a bar or a club uh while I'll grant that on rare
(56:27) occasions a woman might approach you this is exceedingly a rare occurrence
(56:34) so it's totally different so when you go out to the bar club you can be pretty
(56:40) certain that you're going to get approached like if I go out to a bar club there's no world where I can expect
(56:46) oh yeah tonight like three girls are going to hit on me and want to [ __ ] me tonight and put in all the work to try
(56:51) to [ __ ] me tonight you'd be surprised I've been I when I was younger I've been to bars and clubs it that's it's
(56:56) different now women are very more like you know you're out here sending DMS we're out here shooting our shot like
(57:03) it's different now I run away from that in the clubs nine out of 10 times honestly okay you yeah you don't find
(57:10) love in the clubs but if you want to find a drink you know like it's easy to yeah girls don't approach in the club I
(57:15) mean you can say that but it's I mean it's that's total cap how many times have you approached a guy in the club
(57:20) well to get like a drink or to get in their section to have sex with them oh no no zero
(57:26) so hold on you're being so disingenuous right now so you'll approach a guy to get his alcohol but you don't have any
(57:32) actual romantic interest whereas what I'm talk so they're not you're not like actually that's the only time I would
(57:38) approach a guy so you just defeated your own
(57:43) argument so there's no risk so essentially you're just saying there's absolutely no risk of a guy going to a
(57:49) club and actually having a woman sexually pursu him um I mean if your man is like a
(57:55) model and he's attractive enough I think that women would gra gravitate towards him but like as a woman I wouldn't go
(58:03) approaching men with the intent to sleep with them I would be approaching them with the intent to get a free drink or like to get a seat at their VIP section
(58:10) so I don't have to stand in my heels all night at the club right so but when I say women don't approach men what I'm
(58:15) talking about I'm not yeah I guess technically you're approaching them so you could procure alcohol that's not really what I'm talking about when men
(58:22) approach women they're Tri they're typically trying to Pro procure uh a relationship or a sexual experience or
(58:28) something like that um so that's kind of what I'm talking about by your own admission here you've just said that
(58:34) okay well women don't really go to the club to do that really whereas men do
(58:41) this would seem to further establish my position I still said I go to the clubs
(58:48) to sit at VIP sections and hang out with my home girls and get free drinks yeah I started with that initially and I'm
(58:54) ending with that too whether the free drinks come from a promoter who's paying me to bring girls to the club and giving
(58:59) me free bottles or it's coming from guys who are paying for Bott why do you think guys go to clubs for the ladies for sure
(59:07) to get late right sure okay so this they're not getting that from me though why do girls go to the club to dance to
(59:13) dance with their girls to listen to good music dress up be cute take photos for the Instagram drink some good
(59:20) liquor you know I tend I I do tend to see when
(59:26) women though mostly not go to clubs where there's only women to dance that's really strange where where are there you
(59:33) would think for instance that if it were true that women only wanted to go to the club so that they could dance with other
(59:38) women to tell each other how cute they were that they would go to a club that was exclusively for women but they don't
(59:45) do that hang on hang on hang on that's super strange can you explain why that
(59:50) is um well actually when I was out in New York trying to look at the night life they
(59:56) had like lgbtq nights and like lesbian nights and they're like all the girls and the gays are invited and I was like
(1:00:03) I would love to go to something like that have to not be worried about a guy trying to sexualize you yeah pray on you
(1:00:10) exactly like I would love to go to one of those so yeah some clubs may have a gay night where you can go in and hang
(1:00:15) out with gay women I guess but 99% of the time that you have gone to a club my
(1:00:22) assumption is that there are men at those clubs yeah mhm but the men AR why not go to a club why not well so why not
(1:00:28) go to a club where there's no men where it's just exclusive do you know a club where there's only women let me know
(1:00:35) I'll be there well you would think if this was a viable model that one of you the Glorious entrepreneurs who own
(1:00:41) 50,000 businesses would simply start an allw Woman's Club you know I
(1:00:47) actually IDE I already own an all girls company next business is a well it's inter it's interesting to me because you
(1:00:54) said you just said that your perception of the club experience is men praying on women wouldn't that further establish
(1:01:01) men having more pretext and justification for not wanting their girlfriends to go to Club because by
(1:01:06) your own admission men pray on women in these environments but women don't typically pray on men in these
(1:01:12) environments yeah but so that's another differential that just further establishes my position that if you're
(1:01:17) in a relationship with a woman she should not be going out to a bar club but it's kind of section the guys like
(1:01:24) pray on you they stand by the bar and they look at you or they're on the Dance Floor looking at you corner of the club so your experience of going to night
(1:01:30) clubs and bars is men men pray on you m why the [ __ ] would you go to these environments what if you take out your
(1:01:36) man with you is that different I bring I invite him to all the clubs with me too does he go yeah and he's like all your
(1:01:42) guy friends just want to [ __ ] you this this and that why would you go to as a I don't know as a guy why would you go to
(1:01:47) the bar if you already have a girl yeah that doesn't make any sense like there's no reason as a guy to go to a bar
(1:01:53) nightclub absent trying to find a woman you already have a woman so why would you go there with her I think it's the
(1:01:59) same for girls too and every relationship that I've been in I unless I was with them I didn't go to clubs or
(1:02:05) bars because if I was going out I would want them there and I think as women we can all admit that when you get drunk at a club you are looking for a companion
(1:02:13) and like that is the goal of going there so like if you're in a relationship for me at least like if I'm drinking and I'm
(1:02:18) not with a boyfriend then like that's the only person I want to be with so I wouldn't I personally haven't and it's
(1:02:23) just like a natural decision I've never been asked not to I just think it's something um gravitate towards you know
(1:02:30) so no one here has been to a woman's only club or like a fem event no well I
(1:02:35) would assume I would assume that let's let's assume for a moment that all of them have right just for like the sake
(1:02:41) of of argument um there's no possible way that that's 99% of the experiences
(1:02:47) right not most of the time that women are going to clubs they not going to same-sex Club so that they can dance so
(1:02:53) that other girls can see they're going to clubs with the opposite sex because they want to get their drink spot right
(1:02:58) I mean isn't that isn't that actually the case and they want attention get drink spot and validation well I don't
(1:03:03) drink alcohol at all so I'm not going to a club for alcohol at all I'm going to like get stress out and dance and
(1:03:10) actually enjoy myself because I don't I'm I don't really like involving myself around people period they stress me out
(1:03:17) yeah well and that may be true but uh you would have to admit that you're an exception to the rule right so it's not
(1:03:24) that all women always only go to clubs for the purposes of having drinks bought to them right but most women seem to go
(1:03:32) to clubs so that they can dance and they want to go to clubs where men are because those men will buy their drinks
(1:03:38) right I mean is that is that not the case or do do you think that most women go to uh go to clubs because they don't
(1:03:45) want their drinks bought when they could go to a you know same-sex Club I mean being single now and going out to the
(1:03:52) clubs with my girls we don't just kind of like depend on aand to BU drinks we'll pregame before um I also don't
(1:03:58) drink too much myself so I'll be smoking before but my if you're pregaming then you're planning on it so literally
(1:04:04) literally if you're pregaming that is planning so you're saying what do we do what do we do if the guys don't buy our
(1:04:11) drinks well then we'll buy our drink because you don't have to depend on a man to go out and have a good night with your home girls you can supply your own
(1:04:18) drinks so it doesn't always have to boil down to a man but my my ex did end up becoming a club promoter anyway so his
(1:04:25) job ended end up becoming to get all the girls to come to the VIP section and I had to be okay with that during our
(1:04:31) relationship too I didn't like the thought of him being at a table with 10 girls in a section at the club getting
(1:04:37) them free drinks but earlier you said wait wait wait that makes no sense because earlier you said yeah but the
(1:04:42) reason I do this socialization uh is because it's uh like for networking purposes and because
(1:04:48) you're making that money but somehow when he's doing the socialization because he's making that money that's
(1:04:53) bad because I'm going with just me and my home girls he's going and he has to
(1:04:59) find other girls from the club he's not there with his boys he's not there with his girl best friends he's there finding
(1:05:05) girls like me and my friends to bring out to the clubs but we also broke up for that reason cuz neither of us liked
(1:05:12) that both of us were going to be we do have to get through the rest of so so it's rules for he but not for
(1:05:18) she he had to go follow these girls on Instagram I didn't I was there to look
(1:05:23) pretty at the table get free drinks with my girlfriends all around me and when you travel in with more girls it's more
(1:05:29) intimidating for guys to come approach you as a girl in a group of eight instead of me being like alone on the Dance Floor by the bar then a guy would
(1:05:36) come up and approach me but I'm literally in secluded sections there's like ropes there's bodyguards and stuff
(1:05:41) around us like no no man praying is just going to come up on me yeah but but the
(1:05:47) idea here still is that you're doing this for money he was doing this for
(1:05:52) money right so I also said the extent of of us connecting stayed in the club I
(1:05:57) only ever talked to people if it were in the club they never got my number or my Instagram he would have to connect with
(1:06:03) these girls outside of the club get their number get their Instagram and bring them into the club is what I'm
(1:06:08) saying because that was his job yes yeah so but he's getting paid for it but
(1:06:14) y'all are saying I can't get paid for it and do the same thing it's different no I'm holding you to your standard right
(1:06:20) I'm not saying what you can or can't do I'm just saying that if your standard is look um you know I need to obsess over
(1:06:26) this dude because you know every click uh you know that he does on anybody's Instagram uh that could be that he's
(1:06:33) having an affair or something like this which is legitimate I just think that if you're also going to the club and doing
(1:06:39) the same type of nightlife even though it may have a slightly different context it seems fair uh that if you say it's
(1:06:46) okay for me to do it because there's money involved that you would apply that same standard to him right yeah the ratio of me going out is nine girls to
(1:06:54) maybe one per but when it's him it's going to be the one promoter to the nine girls that he's going to be around it's
(1:07:00) just different that's I don't know why like if because you add friends somehow it
(1:07:06) makes it better like I I don't I don't are are your friends just like holding you to account or they like ah girl you
(1:07:12) can't do x y and no they're not holding you to account right they're out partying right like rock stars my
(1:07:18) friends are loyal so they would be the type to promote monogamy in the club and not promote cheating behaviors yes so so
(1:07:25) okay um have you said you went out with your boyfriend right mhm I'd always invite you guys would go out together M
() 
(1:07:31) were there ever any situations when you were out with him where like some drunk guy said something maybe did something
(1:07:38) and he had to intervene in some sort of way or happens all the time to me he was not too confrontational he's more of
(1:07:45) like a if they really do something to us then we'll fight back but that's okay but has something like that happened
(1:07:52) yeah just kind of like verbal stuff but I kind of knew how to fend them off myself so he never had to step in were
(1:07:58) you ever disappointed that your boyfriend didn't step in a little bit this I never want anything to go say to
(1:08:03) all the men viewing never go with your girl first off don't dat girls who go to bars clubs parties second off if it
(1:08:12) never go out in any sort of environment where there's alcohol with your girl
(1:08:18) it's the amount of men I've seen get sparked up in a fight because the girl I
(1:08:24) don't know bro it's don't do it gentlemen don't go out with your girl because either you're in the situation
(1:08:30) here you're in the situation here where she's disappointed in you for not stepping up to some drunk idiot in a bar
(1:08:37) or you do step up and either you [ __ ] the guy up and then you catch a case or you get [ __ ] brain damage cuz he
(1:08:43) knocks you out you [ __ ] hit your head on the concrete on the floor boom boom boom whatever it is so I know you laugh
(1:08:48) but I mean this [ __ ] happens all the time yeah I never wanted to get to that point that's why we yeah but it's just
(1:08:53) like stupid it's it's so stupid to go out with your girl but is it like a bonding moment for you and your partner
(1:08:59) to go out have drinks together dance together have a good night together come home no I thought that was fun until why
(1:09:07) why can't you go like do normal couple [ __ ] like I thought I thought that was normal couple [ __ ] to go out one not
(1:09:12) every night every weekend but why I mean that was because my ex that's what he like to do so I would go
(1:09:18) always go with him I mean that's fine look people can do it I just think it's really ill advised for men because there some like some dumbass in the like I'm
(1:09:26) not excusing the actions of these other PE men who get drunk or whatever but like it's gonna [ __ ] happen a guy you
(1:09:33) don't want to like be the one who like okay and also like half the [ __ ] fights I've ever seen in these sort of
(1:09:38) sorts of environments it's over a chick and also can point out that there's a
(1:09:43) distinction between going to your local pub with your significant other and having dinner and some beers or drinks
(1:09:50) or something like that and then going home for that bonding versus going to a nightclub that's fil with 90% singles
(1:09:57) including drunk horny men that seems like a recipe for dis I don't know why that would need to be part of the
(1:10:02) bonding you know position I've seen people literally like
(1:10:07) get paramedics come [ __ ] brain permanent brain damage from I've like guys like come up to me ask like oh do
(1:10:13) you want a drink and my and my man's like oh she's with me and she doesn't want to drink for you and I was like see like stuff like that yeah but you said
(1:10:19) you've seen like that those situations where girl the guy says some dumb [ __ ]
(1:10:24) boyfriend got to [ __ ] in got to do something about it yeah but again I mean we also know I mean I don't I don't
(1:10:31) think people are so ignorant they don't know where the party spots are like where where the singles are and the younger men younger women are uh again I
(1:10:38) think the big difference uh if you go to TGI Fridays and you have a couple of drinks and you know the baby back ribs
(1:10:45) versus going to a nightclub that see it seems like uh I don't know why you'd need to go to a nightclub in order to bond that just seems strange cuz like
(1:10:52) sometimes the DJs play good music that you wouldn't get at TGI Fridays or the pub around the corner from your house
(1:10:58) and it's just a different an a different Ambiance like you come out and it's nice you want to step out in your lub
(1:11:04) Vuittons and your nice gown yeah I don't want to come dressed out to TGI Fridays
() 
(1:11:10) just to come back home and like changing into some PJs like I want to dance with him on the dance floor and like get it
(1:11:16) on like Usher style like we in the club why can't you do that at home yeah you're still can but I mean I can just
(1:11:23) play something off my Bluetooth speaker and it's just St yeah I guess we can I mean personally I only had really good
(1:11:29) experiences with my man at the club me too and I've been a couple times with I never had one bad experience it's always
(1:11:34) super fun like party with your with your just me personally me personally I'll
(1:11:40) grant that I'm like you want to party with your person highly introverted and like I [ __ ] hate bars and clubs and [ __ ] can you guys actually make like a
(1:11:46) compelling argument or articulate like what is actually fun about going to the
(1:11:51) bar I can kind of understand hold on I can kind of understand it a bit more from the woman's perspective free drinks
(1:11:58) you're getting all kind of attention male validation etc etc I guess girls like to dance or whatever the [ __ ] why
(1:12:05) like what's actually fun about it and then perhaps like what would even on top of that what's actually fun about it for
(1:12:10) a guy like I just don't understand it whatsoever I think it's dancing with your girl personally on you right yeah
(1:12:18) like my man always has so much fun like when we're just dancing together and there's not much places where we can just go and just dance and have fun and
(1:12:24) it's dark too so you're not really like like looking at him and like oh like he's dancing bad like yes are both just
(1:12:30) having fun like drunk or not like you don't need liquor too Yeahs if you see a
(1:12:35) DJ yeah there's a companionship there's a companionship being with your um with
(1:12:40) your person and partying together enjoying that defin it's a Vibe for sure it's a Vibe I like are you maybe too old
(1:12:47) for that um I mean I'm 23 so I'm still party
(1:12:52) girl you realize that while per chance you may think that Brian is currently ancient uh just a few years ago he was
(1:12:58) not so the thing is is like and clubs Believe It or Not existed when Brian was
(1:13:04) your age so it's like I don't I don't know why like we don't have a frame of reference here definitely have a frame
(1:13:09) of reference you never went at the club for a show oh like I mean I went a little bit when I was younger I I didn't I was
(1:13:17) never a big drinker though you didn't go to people watched you look like a people Watcher your whole show is people
(1:13:23) watching you love people watch I mean I I went but it was
(1:13:29) like I don't know it's free entertainment it's free people watching and drunk people hilarious honest was
(1:13:34) never I don't know the whole the like the whole experience was not out in public not in a club yeah um
(1:13:43) so okay uh last thing I guess on this whole bar thing then we need to get the rest of people's uh Rel relationship
(1:13:48) status I guess the going back to the whole differential thing I guess what I was trying to get to is um you guys do
(1:13:55) acknowledge I know that like look I'll even grant that you guys go to the club just have fun and dance and it's not
(1:14:01) necessarily to meet men but you guys do acknowledge like maybe maybe not you but you have a girlfriend who like she's
(1:14:06) gone out one night and she's like I want to meet a guy have you guys had that experience maybe for yourself I know a
(1:14:12) lot of you been are in long-term relationships or whatever um but you will admit like some women will go out
(1:14:17) with the hopes of maybe a guy flirting with them or something sure that's the only reason that my friends will want me
(1:14:24) to come out with them honestly it's not my forte but you got to support your girls but we've always said that like for us going out just at least my friend
(1:14:30) group like the pregame is the best part of the night out it's not the club like my two best friends in New York we will
(1:14:36) be at the bar or whatever for probably pregame for 2 hours go to the bar for 20 minutes then leave get pizza go home be
(1:14:41) like we had so much fun together like a great night I love that I think I've just grown up is pre let me me drinking
(1:14:48) beforehand having some cocktails listening to music finishing your makeup girly time
(1:14:55) tailgating and so but and you guys those of you who've been out you guys do
(1:15:00) acknowledge that when you do go out there are men there who are interested in like hitting on you sexually pursuing
(1:15:07) you etc etc you guys acknowledge that right that's like anywhere we go gr on the street yeah you walk to the grocery
(1:15:13) gas station yeah sure I mean you could you could be at Trader Joe's a guy could come approach you I would say it's
(1:15:19) probably more anticipated that it's going to happen at a bar or nightclub exactly uh and also like I don't know
(1:15:25) [ __ ] goes down in the bars and clubs like I don't know I don't think in the history of Trader Joe's there's ever
(1:15:31) been like a guy approaches a girl and then like five minutes later five minutes later he's like finger banging
(1:15:37) her or some [ __ ] true I've seen look I've went to these clubs and parties and
(1:15:43) [ __ ] I've seen stuff happen um sure you know they'll hook up they'll leave the
(1:15:48) club together the [ __ ] like I don't know if the in the history of Trader Joe's that's maybe who knows some guy with
(1:15:54) like immaculate is or some [ __ ] but yeah that only happens at Home Depot it goes down at Home Depot for
(1:16:01) sure but so knowing this I guess um and knowing like here's the
(1:16:07) difference right so men and women we flirt differently so like you said earlier like you like the
(1:16:15) way you'll kind of flirt right is you might just like something you won't actually slide into a DM you'll go out
(1:16:20) to the bar whatever uh even granting that when you do go to these
(1:16:25) environments maybe that's not your intention but you are have any of you
(1:16:30) met met a guy from a party bar or club yeah yeah yeah well you guys have
(1:16:38) been in relationships forever so I have you have what about you I I would say so
(1:16:44) yeah Deborah what about you bar my longest relationship actually I met him in a club in Israel okay and so going
(1:16:51) into that though like were you going out though with like I really want to meet a guy tonight I was on a program so there
(1:16:56) was like a couple hundred of us that would go and like basically just take over the clubs that we went so he it
(1:17:02) wasn't it was College in Israel Baron um but there's a bunch of different programs like that and he was on a
(1:17:07) different program and then everybody just happened to be there that night and then we made out in the club and then we
(1:17:13) dated for like almost two years so it seems like okay when here's the Dilemma that I see though it's like okay so when
(1:17:19) you get into a relationship because men and women flirt differently I think we can agree that
(1:17:25) neither the man or the woman should like you shouldn't go and actively approach somebody right like that would be
(1:17:32) cheating if the guy went up to a girl and like hit on her right that' be cheating relationship and that would
(1:17:38) also be cheating if the woman went up to somebody and hit on them but this sort of ignores the like asymmetry between
(1:17:44) men and women women don't really do that so the way that you guys flirt and this
() 
(1:17:50) is very if if your intention is to find a guy and some of you have met men in these sorts of environments
(1:17:55) the way that you will flirt is you'll put yourself in a position for men to
(1:18:02) come and approach you that's your method of getting men being exposed yeah you you you won't
(1:18:11) like really slide into a bunch of some occasionally but you won't like really slide into DMS you won't like go up to
(1:18:17) men at these environments but you'll put yourself in a position maybe you'll put yourself in proximity stand next to them
(1:18:23) you can see us you're saying it's like cat and mouse essentially well yeah so the conduct in which the way in which
(1:18:29) women will flirt doesn't change once they're it's more strategic basically
(1:18:36) hold on let me I'll I'll tell you what I'm getting at and so in a relationship we only like shut
(1:18:44) down the ways in which men flirt but there is no expectation really that's
(1:18:50) placed on women that men need to shut down the way you guys make yourselves
(1:18:56) available to men so you continue you when you're in a relationship a lot of
(1:19:01) women continue their single conduct does that make
(1:19:07) sense yeah but the way so the way we conduct ourselves when we're single would not be acceptable once we're in a
(1:19:14) relationship but the way you guys conduct yourselves when you're single that's never challenged and I think it
(1:19:20) ought to be so if you're in a relationship with a guy you got to stop posting review revealing photos you got
(1:19:25) to stop dressing revealing and you got to stop going out to bars clubs and parties even if you have no intention of
(1:19:32) approaching a guy you know going to these events you will be approached some guys like that though
(1:19:38) they like their girl getting attention not really so in the way that we have to shut down our
(1:19:45) options you don't shut down your options when you guys are in a relationship and I find that interesting but Brian have
(1:19:50) you never had the experience with girls where you're just like excuse me do you have a tissue and they're like I have a boyfriend don't speak to me there are so
(1:19:56) many women who act like that where they won't even talk to another man literally like I have a boyfriend they're like I'm
(1:20:01) just trying to seat you at your table for dinner so I think it just comes on every side but I definitely agree with you and I think to take it a step
(1:20:08) further that if you don't want to do that if you're not with somebody who makes you want to you know just put your
(1:20:13) eyes his eyes on you and really only pursue that relationship then I don't think you're with the right person and I think every girl has experienced that
(1:20:19) where a guy when you're talking to a guy he either makes you want to never speak to another man ever again or reminds you
(1:20:25) how much better you can get and then encourages you to date more and find a
(1:20:31) better match for yourself I'm perfectly willing to grant that there are women who are who are in relationships who go to these environments and they will shut
(1:20:37) down 100% of the men 100% of the time the and that might very well be the case
(1:20:45) although there's certainly situations where like I mean women have a hypergamous nature there very well could be a case it's like well are we are like
(1:20:51) in like an argument phase of our relationship and is oh this guy's like I
(1:20:57) know if this other guy who's stepping to you if he's like exceptional in some additional way like you just got to
(1:21:03) close down your options but even putting that aside if you guys are looking to men to
(1:21:09) be leaders and to be protectors one one component of us being
(1:21:16) protectors would be we have to have some say and Authority when it comes to your conduct and protecting the relationship
(1:21:23) because if you're going to these parties let's say you have no intention of cheating some guy could rofy you we're
(1:21:28) looking out for you I don't want you in the club and you know he could somebody could put something in your drink some
(1:21:34) guy could grab your ass and you feel terrible about it and I'm not that's terrible Behavior but guys are drunk
(1:21:40) they do that [ __ ] I don't want to expose my girlfriend to that kind of conduct from other men and and also just I don't
(1:21:47) drink and party and all that stuff so like I'm not dating women who do this for the most part anyways but uh yeah
(1:21:54) we're just trying to protect you so I like that point of view um but that's why like when I said I get paid to go
(1:21:59) here I know the promoters like they'll get us a section for me and my girls to sit at so our drinks aren't anywhere
(1:22:06) near where it can get roofied on the dance floor or guys aren't close enough to be smacking our ass like we're
(1:22:11) literally sitting enjoying ourselves in the club and we have our own secluded area to dance if we did want to dance we
(1:22:17) don't have to step onto the sweaty dance floor in close proximity with stre I'm just curious like look I I'm not all
(1:22:24) there's different kinds of clubs different kinds of environments I mean I know you're saying that but like to me just from a business perspective um they
(1:22:33) the reason they have the women in the clubs is like the men they want to talk to the women they want to interact with the women um you're saying well you've
(1:22:42) got your little space so you're saying in the history of all the times you've been to a bar and you have your section
(1:22:50) no guy has ever talked to you ever well I have single friends who are there with
(1:22:55) me so they'll go off and Mingo or they'll go talk to some guys and it's
(1:23:00) not technically me who's bringing guys to the clubs but it's the girls that I bring and you know guys see more girls
(1:23:08) are in the club so they're willing to pay a cover fee or they're willing to spend for a couple of drinks at the bar
(1:23:13) to get tipsy to go hit on some girls they're willing to spend on the girls who are there to milk their money throughout the course of your
(1:23:18) relationship when you're going out to the bars and the clubs did a guy uh at
(1:23:24) the club or bar ever say anything inappropriate to you in fact you wait you already admitted to this because you
(1:23:29) said there are a few times you were out even with your boyfriend and you were hopeful that he would intervene in some way but he didn't because he's
(1:23:36) non-confrontational okay so did you you even admitted that it happens yeah um when you go out even with your boyfriend
(1:23:42) I feel like some guys have no dis no regard for relationships sometimes having a man will make them want to hit
(1:23:48) on you more some of my experiences like compete with him so that's even I mean
(1:23:53) that seems like a really good reason to not go out to the club but even being a singer songwriter when I go perform at
(1:23:59) all these clubs bars venues and la like there are guys who are fawning over me in the crowd and my boyfriend has to
(1:24:05) like witness this what can he do uh not go to the Barrow Club he's just there to
(1:24:11) support me performing oh oh what you're doing a performance I perform at clubs and bars
(1:24:16) too and there's guys in the clubs and bars who find me attractive okay all right well all right guys we have a
() 
(1:24:23) couple chats here that I'm going to read uh and then we'll get to the relationship status we've got actually Deborah can I have you read this these
(1:24:29) yes if you can see call me skeptical but this chick wanted to lock down half of the marital I can't see EST Marsh no no
(1:24:37) I think it says marital the C I can read guys swe marital State before she blindsided him with the poly crap at
(1:24:43) which point he was stuck in financial straight jacket by the way dot dot dot uh wait hold on
(1:24:52) uh oh sorry this one okay go ahead continued by the way I'm a lawyer
(1:24:57) don't [ __ ] me dude got totally railroaded by the vile woman gents out there eyes wide open I believe this is
(1:25:04) to you do you have a response to Lucas I guess you would know takes one to No One baby okay cool rock and roll
(1:25:12) uh relationship status what about you uh I have a pet mhm I I have a pet like a
(1:25:19) guy that that acts like my dog oh wait hold on Oh I thought you you were joking
(1:25:25) um you have he SLE on my floor on the dog bed you have a he's like a sub is
() 
(1:25:30) that what you call or slave he just does whatever I ask servant so you have a Master Slave BDSM Dynamic one of yeah
(1:25:36) basically I I don't I went you're being serious right yeah I I was in I got out of abusive relationship about a year ago
(1:25:42) the guy tried to strangle me like five times ran to the neighbor house I'm not sure how that's relevant but okay so I I ended up with a because as you know the
(1:25:49) best way to recover from being in an abusive relationship is to abuse somebody
(1:25:56) everybody knows that well I don't hit him or anything and he's he he he yeah just humiliate him make him sleep in a
(1:26:02) dog bed does he have a dog I told him he could I didn't tell him he had to he asked me to buy him a dog bed yeah you realize you do realize that
(1:26:10) there are mentally ill individuals out there who do mentally ill things and that it is very enabling when a person's
(1:26:16) like well I know that you're mentally ill and sick in the head that you'd be willing to sleep in a dog bed like a
(1:26:21) freak but I'm going to go ahead and some way get some sort of gratification from that like what does doesn't that say
(1:26:28) something bad about you uh I didn't think about it but I guess I I don't
(1:26:33) know I I take care of him financially I pay all of his bills like why because I
(1:26:39) I don't know I she's the dumb she's the D I just enjoy the Comfort it's to I
(1:26:44) don't think so you how would you you would forget that or how would you forget that I tell him he's a good boy
(1:26:50) though does he bark for you he probably would if I asked him to is this surround
(1:26:55) child yeah what kind of pet Dynamic is this have you this is like that off have you seen that Office episode where they
(1:27:01) like went to Jan's like Michael and Jan's house and like Jan had the whole bed she walks in with a collar he had
(1:27:08) the otom that's kind of what it is actually and then there's like a there's like a what's it called you know at the
(1:27:14) edge of the bed there's a ottoman it was like an ottoman he slept on the ottoman
(1:27:19) are you 100% serious wait is it abusive if there's a contract that says he consents to this I mean look it is a BSM
(1:27:27) relationship I yeah I mean I'm sure I'm sure if a man for instance were to have some type of contract with a woman that
(1:27:33) it was okay for him to well I don't know smack her around whenever he felt like it you would still consider that to be abusive even though it was contractual
(1:27:39) right I looked it up by law it's it's technically if it's consensual by a contract you're
(1:27:44) okay you wouldn't think that that was abusive I mean if I don't like it and I'm saying
(1:27:51) no then yeah that's a form of abuse I think how long has this been going
(1:27:56) on uh well I've known him for 8 years but it became more of a thing recently how recently like about about a
(1:28:04) year now so you guys been together for a year uh we're not together well okay hold on do you take
(1:28:10) him on walks does he get little cheats he actually thought that would be funny he's already talked about that yeah so
(1:28:17) um are you dating somebody else no no no no I have so how long how long how long
(1:28:23) have you been single uh about a year maybe a year and a half all right longest relationship uh 12
(1:28:30) years was that the one that ended a year ago oh no uh I dated someone when I started dating when I was 10 years old
(1:28:37) and didn't quit till my early 20s how old were they they're also 11 same age 11 and that was the 12 year relationship
(1:28:44) uhhuh okay uh who broke up with who in the 12E relationship
(1:28:49) um he admitted something openly that like he had gotten raped and then
(1:28:54) couldn't you got to say essay man oh ESS sorry ESS uh that he got essayed and
(1:29:00) then he kind of ghosted me I think he was just ashamed of the fact that he was
(1:29:05) violated okay your relationship that ended a year ago how long was that one
(1:29:11) um that was a year all right who broke up with who um he just got arrested and
(1:29:18) it ended from there arrested for what he tried to strangle me within five times with one night was it consensual no no
(1:29:25) no I was running I ran to the next door neighbor I was running away from him uh was this the first time he tried to hurt
(1:29:31) you no okay no it was second and after the second it was just that's done all
(1:29:37) right were you guys having an argument or no he got he was drunk he got mad about pizza I put the he ordered pizza
(1:29:44) and then he passed out and I put it in the fridge and he got mad that I put it in the fridge started just freaking out
(1:29:50) on me and screaming on me mental illness okay why are you so attracted to
(1:29:55) mentally old men abusive men I don't know I don't know I I can't I can't I've never
(1:30:03) actually had a deep conversation with myself childhood trauma perhaps yeah probably the current uh the current a
(1:30:10) guy that you're not seeing but lives in your house and you pay all of his bills uh do you have a carnal relationship
(1:30:16) with this gentleman like what wait what kind of relationship I didn't sexual is it a sexual relationship um no really
(1:30:24) haven't had much sex in like a year I I would say it it has been like twice and
(1:30:31) then I just know it's not sexual anymore wait you've had sex with him Twi yeah yeah in the very beginning and then I
(1:30:37) just I just can't have sex with him anymore how often does he sleep on your floor every night oh every night he
(1:30:44) comes over and sleeps oh he lives in your house he he doesn't leave my house does he do your chores yes can can you
(1:30:49) just break down like everything he does for you um holds my jacket if I have girlfriends he holds their jackets and
(1:30:56) purses if I need him to walk to the grocery store he will if I get sick he'll take care of me if he gets sick I
() 
(1:31:01) take care of him um um yeah everything any any house tore I need done he'll get
(1:31:08) done for me okay he just doesn't drive does he wear anything and is he is he older than you yeah he's 30 yeah okay so
(1:31:17) um the couple couple of quick questions um I'm just curious about when when if
(1:31:24) you think about what is mentally stable right or somebody who's not mentally ill would would you see it as a sign of
(1:31:31) perhaps abnormality a man who was willing to sleep on the ground in a dog bed and be ordered about by a person who
(1:31:40) uh owned the place to the point where they would stand there as a coat rack or uh have endless demands put on them
(1:31:47) which are essentially dehumanizing uh what what is that we repeat that first part of the sentence
(1:31:53) um please yeah you consider that mentally stable grao tact donated
(1:32:00) $200 girls do men expect extremely kinky SL weird stuff in bed due to Corn
(1:32:05) becoming more extreme can you give examples have you ever had to break up
(1:32:11) because a sex actor guy wanted was too crazy for you we'll come right back to that graffo go uh go ahead Andrew yeah
(1:32:17) sure I'm just wondering do you consider that to be mental mentally stable Behavior I I don't think he's mentally stable at all I have definitely know
(1:32:24) he's not mentally stable but he's not capable of taking care of himself I've tried to help him get his driver's license I've tried to help him get I
(1:32:31) mean are you are you a psychologist no no I mean so you can't you can't make a
(1:32:36) a diagnosis guess I can't I can't but he doesn't about whether or not hang on hang on about whether or not a person
(1:32:42) can take care of themselves and if even if he couldn't and I'll just grant to you that he couldn't wouldn't you then
(1:32:47) defer that to professionals who could assist him so that he could take care of himself rather than exploiting a
(1:32:52) mentally ill person making them sleep on the floor like a dog how is that not monstrous uh I guess I thought because
(1:33:00) it's consensual and he like wants to be next to me all the time I didn't think it was is it is it consent if a mentally
(1:33:05) ill person gives consent are they really giving consent he was a diagnoses mentally ill so I mean I I don't know I
(1:33:13) I never thought about this sorry Andrew I just wanted to jump in you mentioned before the show that you're a mother how if you have a mentally ill person that
(1:33:20) you acknowledge is mentally ill living in your home how is how are you feel safe with your child around him like why
(1:33:25) are you exposing your child to that my daughter loves him and he's really good with my daughter too you just said that he's mentally ill well I I don't know
(1:33:33) what you guys considered mentally ill like he can take care of himself he's good with kids like what what dark would
(1:33:39) would bark like dog if requested stands as coat rack for you sleeps on the floor at like a dog is treated as a pet by you
(1:33:46) by your admission Still Human I I think that a person who would be willing to uh
(1:33:51) to do that sounds like they have some screws loose yeah mhm yeah but he's not like he has a good heart like he's not
(1:33:58) like a bad person I'm not blaming him I don't think he's bad I don't think I don't think that uh the person here
() 
(1:34:05) who's completely unwell bad person she asked about my kid and if he was a bad person of course he wouldn't be around
(1:34:11) my kid but he's not a bad person he's actually really good with people but what do you do you think that is not
(1:34:17) sending some sort of message or like teaching your you said it was a daughter I believe well he doesn't do that if my
(1:34:22) kid is there I sure uh co-parent with my sister so if he my
(1:34:28) if my sister like gives me like we share custy um if my daughter's there he
(1:34:34) doesn't do that around my daughter no not only that but do not think that it's confusing your daughter to see her
(1:34:40) mother in a relationship with a man who's a dorat for her instead of like a loving monogamous relationship or even not a monogamous relationship but like a
(1:34:46) real partner you have a point she kind of like she kind of I guess so yeah cuz she's dominant too like she kind of
(1:34:52) tells him what to do and yeah no that there's a point there yeah cuz like the Father Figure in your life or at least
(1:34:58) whoever that is maybe the stepdad the dad who stepped up whatever it might be in people's situations I know that for
(1:35:04) women that really determines a lot about the future relationships that they engage in and what they expect for themselves and what they think they
(1:35:10) deserve like shout out to my dad who would warm the car up every single morning before school when I was a kid
(1:35:15) like do you not want better for your daughter than this don't you think you deserve a real partner in life who I
(1:35:20) think I'm just scared of men because I went through a year ago when I've known him for 8 years so it's easier to be close to someone you're comfortable with
(1:35:27) than get abused again have your thought of conquering that fear and like I don't know CBT therapy or something like that
(1:35:32) to really move past it instead of just having I'm trying to go to therapy but every time I try to get therapy it seems like there's always an issue trying to
(1:35:38) get a therapist to help with something so I I I've I've definitely reached out to people I've definitely asked for help
(1:35:45) but like it seems like there's always like a insurance problem if I get that fixed there's another issue like well
(1:35:51) have you thought about the idea that uh perhaps you're just a horrible person have you thought have you have you
(1:35:57) perhaps reconciled the fact that um you could just be a [ __ ] awful person who likes to uh do damage to
(1:36:04) men no no cuz I've had boyfriend say I'm a wonderful girlfriend like I've had
(1:36:09) boyfriend when you make him sleep on the floor make him act as a coat W for your friends so you can demean him
(1:36:15) technically he's not my boyfriend but when I've had boyfriends I've cleaned their dishes taken care of their dog walked their dog I've also been the one
(1:36:22) that takes care of their stuff while they're paying the financial bills and I just sit there and I take care of them
(1:36:28) you know I think that there's an overemphasis often on the idea of therapy therapist and the fact that you
(1:36:34) need a mental mental health professional to come in I think that the first step
(1:36:39) uh honestly is uh where's the common sense here like uh I I don't actually
(1:36:45) even understand like where is the common sense this guy has the right to leave if you make a man sleep on the floor like a
(1:36:51) dog and then publicly Proclaim that he's your pet right you might be a horrible
(1:36:56) [ __ ] person like I don't know why you go anywhere he wants you pay all his bills why would he
(1:37:03) ever leave if you're paying all his bills he doesn't really have he's like leing off of you he's he's not trapped there either but he doesn't have an
(1:37:09) incentive to leave if you're paying all his bills why would he go be broker and homeless or whatever it might be saying
(1:37:14) if he if anybody thought I was a horrible person they can always get up and leave my place
(1:37:19) too ined him to stay in this environment dependent he depend he's dependent on you he's you've incentivized him it's
(1:37:26) kind of like federal government Aid on welfare that if you're just getting a consistent check or something why would you ever go and get your own job or
(1:37:32) figure out something else like here I'll show I'll show you what she's saying right let's let's this let's reverse
(1:37:37) this for a second hang on let's reverse it let's pretend for a second that uh I
(1:37:42) was on the panel and I said well I found a mentally unwell woman who can't take care of herself and she's totally
(1:37:49) dependent upon me at night I make her sleep on the ground right I make her do all sorts of sexual things whenever I
(1:37:55) feel like it right and I treat her like a doormat in front of every woman who
(1:38:00) comes over not not a doormat like ooh I'm kind of rude to her but literally make her stand there with her arm
(1:38:07) extended and then me and my friends hang our coats and balance our drinks from her little nose would you would any
(1:38:14) woman here not say that that was [ __ ] horrific and that I was a monster go
(1:38:20) ahead I just by a show of hand who would say if I said all of that to you that I was a monster show of
(1:38:28) hands yeah yeah okay but somehow The Sisterhood can't be bothered to express
(1:38:35) to this woman that what she's doing is [ __ ] monstrous no one's ever said anything to me yeah I'm sure they
(1:38:44) haven't well I guess it's because on Twitter like I've seen a lot of stuff about um findom so like what is that
() 
(1:38:52) findom is I don't know specific terms and all that but um she's just saying we don't
(1:38:58) King Shame around here exactly I was like some people are into that stuff so I just try to like respectfully listen I
(1:39:05) haven't really thought that people are like mentally ill yeah but if it was man you're saying allive people are mentally
(1:39:13) that's basically what you're saying is all all people that want to actually be cuz there's people that pay people to be
(1:39:19) made people that enjoy that like there's people that dress up in sex outfits and clean your house and live there
(1:39:25) permanently yeah they're mentally unwell they're mentally unwell these the listen you can't that a guy who demands that you
(1:39:33) take his last dime so that he can come harder is not a mentally unwell man of
(1:39:39) course they're mentally unwell and it's and it's exploiting that mental unwellness and it's like somehow I don't
(1:39:45) understand why women give each other a pass on this why not like you sick psychopath why are you doing this
(1:39:51) horrible thing to this guy I I I don't actually get it I guess I I I can explain that we get we some women when
(1:39:58) we're like doing this [ __ ] we get like kind of I don't know our brain when Society is like oh that's okay then we
(1:40:04) start doing we get used to doing that stuff it's not anybody doesn't tell us it's wrong we're not going to break that
(1:40:09) pattern of being like oh that that doesn't sound right no you know because we kind of get like into this like just
(1:40:16) as all of society kind of brainwashed into [ __ ] and we kind of like don't think that's brainwashing yeah but did
(1:40:21) he ask for this or did you propose the idea he asked for the dog bed he's asked
(1:40:27) for this stuff like I didn't did he like sit you down have a conversation with you actually
(1:40:32) yeah kind of yeah a little bit and do you ever see this ending is there an end point in the future yeah I haven't
(1:40:38) thought about that but they're yeah but the the I mean if I if I met somebody that I actually enjoyed spending time
(1:40:45) with that actually like wasn't like wanted to do the equal part like get a have a car and they had a good job then
(1:40:52) yeah I would be like yeah you know what I I found someone that I actually appreciate like they want to put half of
(1:40:57) the weight into the relationship I probably would be like this is not going to work go it seems like from everything that you've said about relationships
(1:41:03) that like relationships to you are just like a financial situation where like if we want to go 50/50 provide for him he
(1:41:09) provides for me but like in my opinion there's so much more like especially when it comes to long-term monogamy and having a child already if her dad's not
(1:41:15) in her life having a strong person to help I know being a single mom it's impossible to do everything that's amazing that your sister helps out but
(1:41:22) even being able to spend enough quality time with your child while also trying to bring income in I'm only 24 I don't
(1:41:27) have a daughter but I do have friends who have you know children and they have husbands who are very helpful and I can't imagine them doing things they
(1:41:34) like to have a good man yeah has this started from when you were young have you always gone after abusive men or at
(1:41:40) least men who just weren't up high value up to the standard really wanted you for
(1:41:45) everything that you are and not just the financial aspect yeah yeah it's been an issue with starting with my my
(1:41:51) narcissistic mother to like uh the men she dated yeah so so do you
(1:41:57) see that you're repeating that pattern for your daughter now when you can break the cycle instead and choose better um
(1:42:04) I've started to notice it more recently and it's been very difficult to break something that's psychologically
(1:42:10) ingrained into me I need like that's that's not an overnight healing thing
(1:42:16) that you can just do overnight that is a lot of work to put in well is your daughter not worth putting in the work
(1:42:21) for well yes she is so then why is not start tomorrow kick him out of your house you don't have to find a new man
(1:42:26) but you can put all that energy into your child and you can heal and attract somebody who wants you for who you are
(1:42:32) not just any Financial benefits that you can offer not for a dog bed for genuinely who you are as a human being
(1:42:38) you know I actually the last week I've been like we've started fighting about stupid [ __ ] and I was like you know I
(1:42:44) don't know why I'm doing this but I've been doing it for a while and it's not enjoyable like it was when it when we
(1:42:50) were first like connected it was just a past relationship and I'm dragging that along with me cuz I'm scared of like
(1:42:57) fully embracing being in the future and all in the past and I think that's just trauma just holding me back from being
(1:43:04) happy the best advice I ever got no you're not you're not a victim here you got let go you're not a victim you're
(1:43:10) the victimizer here you're the victimizer not the victim like every
(1:43:16) time every time I I see this this pattern of when a woman is clearly
(1:43:21) victimizing man clearly Vic victimizing him well it's okay don't give me too much push back because after all I have
(1:43:27) former trauma it's like that's no excuse I'm sorry you don't you don't you don't get to do horrible things to people because horrible things were done to you
() 
(1:43:35) all of us have had horrible things done to us all of us no you're no exception right everybody's had horrible things
(1:43:40) done to them in life and have dealt with horrible challenges in life everybody has dealt with horrible challenges yeah
(1:43:47) right you what you're doing right now right you should you should be reflective because um this is this is
(1:43:52) Psych it's psychotic and horrific and you like you just got to stop right you just got to stop doing it it's it's it's
(1:43:59) horrific yeah but I would say like no one's perfect we can all learn from everything and and you know oh yeah yeah
(1:44:06) that's fine you know just go shoot a guy down the road and be like yeah no one's perfect you know I you got to live and learn you're a perfect person what do
(1:44:13) you mean I I I wasn't allowed to go shoot that it's like come on yeah but you haven't made mistakes you haven't
(1:44:19) made mistakes you're perfect like you haven't had trauma affect your life like you're I just got done telling you that
(1:44:25) not only have I dealt with all sorts of personal baggage trauma all sorts of things right just like everybody else
(1:44:31) has that is not an excuse for me to be a horrible person but you learned from I
(1:44:37) don't I don't get a pass like no one's ever going to be like well Andrew you being a horrible bastard I'm going to go
(1:44:43) ahead and give you the pass on that because of past trauma but for some reason reflexively women go because
(1:44:49) horrible thing done to me I was a perfect angel till some man corupted me so therefore doing horrible things to
(1:44:55) other people is acceptable it's not acceptable I was traumatized when a Zen was spit in my cup I'm not spitting in
() 
(1:45:00) anybody else's Cup this time I mean you I think I actually just saw you put something in my cup you wish what the
(1:45:07) [ __ ] uh okay all right all right uh thank you Rachel for the Super Chat by the way poen oh there you go there you
(1:45:14) go okay we have a chat here from Lucas uh can you read it Deborah yes I also we missed that to go back to that one from
(1:45:20) before whenever nice PEB Herman response it's suddenly obvious that you're quite the highbrow intellect nevertheless I've
(1:45:26) been married 22 years plus two kids oh and by the way my billing rate is 1250 an hour so do the math wait are you cry
(1:45:32) are you crying are you crying are you crying cuz you did horrible [ __ ] things to a
(1:45:38) person and you finally realize that you're doing horrible things to a person no I just you need you need to cry it's
(1:45:44) good for you to cry that's you know what that's called called taking resp I get that but you got to understand like
(1:45:49) people aren't [ __ ] perpect people make mistakes and we can learn from you shouldn't just be like Oh I'm a [ __ ]
(1:45:55) human being just because I didn't recognize something I can change and I can grow oh boohoo oh you did a horrible
(1:46:01) thing to a person and you it was pointed out that you need to stop being horrible [ __ ] told me was
(1:46:06) doability take some accountability for the horrible [ __ ] things that you're doing and you you should cry about it
(1:46:12) because it's [ __ ] awful it's awful so you never treated a girl like [ __ ] before no I've never made a woman sleep
(1:46:19) on the ground like a dog and took her from walks and exploited her mental illness it's psychotic and you know what he doesn't I don't even know if he has a
(1:46:26) [ __ ] mental illness so that's a [ __ ] assumption he seems on a for like a dog at his own request wanted to
(1:46:31) I didn't ask him to [ __ ] do that he wanted to do that that was his choice I
(1:46:37) told him he could sleep on the head the bed he wanted guy comes over wants to cut off his arm are you going to be like
(1:46:42) well it was his choice I told him he could sleep on the bed he chose to sleep on the floor how is that my [ __ ]
(1:46:48) fault because you have agency and accountability and
(1:46:54) as an adult he can choose to sleep on the floor he can choose to sleep on the bed that's not that doesn't make me a
(1:46:59) horrible [ __ ] person you have a duty an accountable Duty because you are
(1:47:05) mentally well so I if he wants to sleep on the floor should say get up on the bed get up on the bed get up on the bed
(1:47:12) cuz that is not fair to me to tell a person how they should be living their life if he wants to live on the floor he
(1:47:17) can live on the floor if he wants to live on the bed he can get up on the bed and sleep on the bed I gave him that option but if you didn't play the part
(1:47:24) of like him being your pet would he still do that if you just treat him like a normal human being instead of a dog I
(1:47:29) don't that's what he wants then maybe if you just stopped doing that he wouldn't find use with you of that anymore well I
(1:47:35) mean maybe I don't know I just told him he could sleep on the bed I never said hey you can do this or you want this he
(1:47:41) chose to sleep on the floor that was his well look how quick those fake tears dried up wow cool
(1:47:50) bro that's really great
(1:47:58) awkward someone someone asked a question earlier we didn't get back I like that you invalidate the fact that someone
() 
(1:48:04) actually has motion because you think that I'm some psycho but yeah you actually think you're some God right like you think you're the best do I
(1:48:10) don't think I'm a God I think I but but here's the thing right it's like what it's not godly it's not it's not me
(1:48:18) thinking to tell you to stop being a [ __ ] horrific human being and put floor putting him on the floor treating
(1:48:25) I didn't put him on the floor and they made that very clear I gave the option to sleep on the bed I gave him that
(1:48:32) option I didn't say hey go sleep on the floor I didn't tell him to sleep on the floor he has the option to sleep on a
(1:48:38) bed he chose to do that so he has every right to do that or he has every right to sleep on the bed he as a 30-year-old
(1:48:45) man he can do whatever the [ __ ] he wants to do I just I gave him the option have
(1:48:50) no responsibility no accountability no Duty what what do you want me to grab him by his arms and put him on my fing
(1:48:56) bed I don't I'm not controlling how about you can you get him some help I I don't
(1:49:04) know how I'm not in control of a [ __ ] 30-year-old you don't have to be in contr can go he can go to anything get
(1:49:11) the resources if this if if you're in charge to the point where you can treat him like a coat rack and hang your
(1:49:17) jacket on him you think you can't take him you think if you say hey boy come on and get in the car cuz I'm going to take
(1:49:22) you over to the clinic so that they can get you mentally evaluated he's not going to go with you you just don't have any Duty here you have no I mean I've
(1:49:29) taken him to get an Obama phone I he got an Obama phone I've taken him to get food stamps I've put in the time to
(1:49:35) actually take care of this person and make sure they're trying to get steps towards going somewhere else because you
(1:49:40) get because you get off on torturing him no I don't yeah you do otherwise you wouldn't make him stand as a coat rack
(1:49:46) and hang your coats I don't necessarily offers to take people's coats like he offers to help out
(1:49:55) mhm I mean this the story kind of changes by the second so that you can make it sound like it's less horrible
(1:50:01) than what it is you have a duty you have a responsibility you're crying cuz it's the first time anybody's ever told you that how did you get through life how
(1:50:08) did you get this far in life without somebody telling you that you're not allowed to do that to
(1:50:15) people because maybe you're making it seem bad worse than it actually is yeah whatever yeah maybe you're making it try
(1:50:22) to seem like it's not as bad as it actually is because that's another form of validation look at me
(1:50:28) okay all righty then okay well we have going to uh unless Andrew did you have
(1:50:35) more you [ __ ] on me for crying and you say it's not okay for me good good I'll [ __ ] on you you know I'm not [ __ ] on
(1:50:41) you for crying right you said are you are you really [ __ ] crying right now and then you said I should [ __ ] cry
(1:50:46) so what make up your godamn mind C good good cry good yeah I [ __ ] will cry
(1:50:52) you need to what you're doing is horrific good cry about it cry more the
(1:50:58) [ __ ] you say that I'm the [ __ ] YouTube one you're telling me to [ __ ] go cry on from this [ __ ] you want to be
(1:51:06) my dom why don't you [ __ ] be my domm while you're at it tell me what the [ __ ] do tell me when I should go to the [ __ ] bathroom you want to be your
(1:51:13) Andrew she she's looking for she's switching roles she was the sub she or no she was the Dom now she wants to be a
(1:51:20) sub Andrew's are married man just letting you know so he's probably not available he's not available as his
(1:51:27) representative as his agent as his PR person he's not available to Dom you I'm sorry I don't want that but I'm just
(1:51:34) saying he tell me what to do so it sounds like you want to be my dad you would be a good D told me to cry [ __ ] is
(1:51:41) happening right now you know the thing is that ultimately let's go back to the question ultimately I'm I'm a very I'm
(1:51:47) very much a very kind man and what you're doing is hor doing is just very [ __ ] kind man
(1:51:53) in the must Yeah well yeah that's right because because here the actual victim
(1:51:59) the actual victim who's not you is who you should be crying for not for

(1:55:39) status so we have Emily that's you like uh you found out
(1:55:47) your ex cheated on you so you made a fake Snapchat account to ask the girls about it you got her FaceTime
() 
(1:55:53) so this is the previous X then you guys are you guys still friends or were friends I don't know um yeah the ex that
(1:56:00) cheated on me how did he cheat on you like he [ __ ] her or so he was
(1:56:08) like can I say like incriminating stuff on here he his job was basically to do
(1:56:13) like drop off yeah so I it wouldn't be like random behavior for him to like be
(1:56:18) waiting at a park or outside of a neighborhood for a little bit but how long were you dating this guy um I think
(1:56:24) for a year how soon into the relationship did you know he was a drug dealer like immediately halfway through
(1:56:32) cuz he he wasn't always like it was something kind of new that started okay was he involved in other kinds of
(1:56:38) illicit contacts like I don't know uh scamming people or anything like that no just like that that one what kind of
(1:56:44) drugs was he selling not too much now um I can't be saying all that what was he
(1:56:50) selling but he was he was just the the driver he would just use the mule that's it he was in possession of the drugs and
(1:56:57) he would drop it somewhere mhm but okay what was he blow cocaine yeah okay
(1:57:04) anything else um meth I didn't really ask too much it's safe to assume it's
(1:57:09) [ __ ] um and how soon into the relationship did you like did he talk to
(1:57:14) you about this yeah we would watch like power and stuff together he was like all about that Scarface life like this
(1:57:22) wasn't so wait uh you said it was 6 months into the one-year relationship that I found out he was cheating no that
(1:57:29) you found out he was selling drugs oh well both yeah both okay that wasn't an
(1:57:35) issue for you that the drug dealing uh no as long as I wasn't involved in it and he was like safe with what he was
(1:57:41) doing it was just kind of not my business it was like what he was doing with his brother so that's like family
(1:57:47) business I was like whatever how can you find both of those things out at the same time was he a white guy what was his R just curious Hispanic Hispanic
(1:57:54) okay um um just cuz it was it was just kind of coincidence like I was going
(1:57:59) through his Facebook and his Spotify like the social medias that you would I guess least think to check um and then I
(1:58:07) don't know I guess women's intuition I had a feeling that the house that he was at wasn't just no drop off he was doing
(1:58:13) yeah I can't even make this up you I don't understand this like woman's intuition thing like if you guys had such good intuition why do you
(1:58:19) constantly date terrible he wasn't a cheater then I don't know I guess no but
() 
(1:58:25) but wouldn't like the the you have this intuition about them cheating why didn't the intuition tell you earlier that this
(1:58:31) was a cheater maybe he was a cheater then but then I don't know maybe he lost
(1:58:36) feelings maybe I was crazy and it drove him you're definitely crazy but um uh wait so hold on uh is that not a red
(1:58:45) flag ladies part the drug deal in doesn't just tell you you've been dating a guy
(1:58:51) for 6 months and he's like by the way babe I'm selling cocaine and meth and heroin I that's not a red flag like it
(1:58:58) he's getting money do you like it no your Bo question for you to you've been in a
(1:59:04) fouryear relationship how long four years two four years four years your boyfriend comes to you tonight after the
(1:59:10) podcast and says babe I am currently a meth any this is breaking bad he he also
(1:59:17) makes the meth makes the meth sells the meth also has cancer do you just kidding
(1:59:23) about the last part um I was like what lung cancer uh do you stay with him or
(1:59:28) do you dump him I feel like for him to be lying that long would be like such a huge right no he just started it like 3
(1:59:34) months ago he hit it he hid it from you but he he's coming clean now he has a bunch of money and he's I don't know
(1:59:40) it's still a red flag but do do you stay with him I don't know I have to be in the situation you're in the situ I
(1:59:47) actually know your current boyfriend he's currently cooking just Kidd you're in the situation right now um is he your
(1:59:54) dealer Brian tell me right now let me find out but but what what's your like knee-jerk
(2:00:01) reaction do you stay with him I don't know I need to talk to this with my mom and be like he's been lying to me this
(2:00:07) whole time I think the mes and heroin would be a deal breaker for me other drugs would be okay but the mees and
(2:00:12) heroin draw the line okay I would stand by mine to be honest I mean I would talk to him though I would be like stop
(2:00:19) Andrew I would like stop but you know it be would this not would this be like a lack of loyalty if a girl dumped a guy
(2:00:26) yeah I'm like get that money would it be unloyal you don't get locked up or I don't get locked up like get that money
(2:00:32) baby we'll keep it on the low for a little bit and then you stop well do you guys remember a story of that
(2:00:40) woman I I'm going to look like a bad political commentator for forgetting her name but there was like pictures of her
(2:00:45) all over Maryland when I was in college there whose boyfriend was a drug dealer and the police came and red her house
(2:00:50) she got shot knows anything about politics story James something there was a whole protest in Maryland but she got
(2:00:58) shot killed in the shooting between the police trying to kill her boyfriend who
(2:01:03) was a violent drug dealer and um Banna Taylor Banna Taylor and there was pictures and her boyfriend was a drug
(2:01:09) dealer she knew she was living in the house with him the cops came in I believe either him or somebody in the
(2:01:15) house fired at the cops the cops fired back she was killed in the cross stage damn Mr ban donated $200 thank you man
(2:01:22) Andrew thank you and God bless you for confronting evil with truth please give
(2:01:28) this woman a specific call to action to stop this Behavior apologize to this guy
(2:01:34) and get him mental help repent yo Mr baseman thank you for the
(2:01:39) TTS do you want to respond to that or into the mic if you are
(2:01:48) uh it's already in the works all right uh Deborah your relationship
(2:01:53) status I am single all right my last relationship ended in May and looking
(2:01:59) for a nice Jewish man all right cool longest relationship a little bit under two years two years who broke up with
(2:02:06) who it was a pretty Mutual situation he was not mentally well and um you made
(2:02:12) him sleep at the uh on the floor no at the edge of the bed once when we had a twin bed he fell off but aside from that
(2:02:18) um no he just wasn't really in a mentally healthy place and to me I didn't think it was fair to continue to
(2:02:25) try and like drag a guy along I want a man who is extremely self-sufficient and a leader and not a case that I have to
(2:02:32) take care of uh and I mean you're fairly successful in your own right when it comes to your career uh so do you need a
(2:02:39) I assume you need like a guy to kind of match you or exceed
(2:02:45) mhm question mark yeah I was like waiting to see where that was going um it's funny because a lot of people who
(2:02:51) try setting me up they're like I have this guy he's super obsessed with politics I'm like that's what I do I don't need a match who's like obsessed
(2:02:57) with politics or does the same thing but the biggest thing for me is my career is I'm very passionate about it it's not
(2:03:03) only my career it's my passion I love every second of what I do truly and a person who's not passionate is extremely
(2:03:10) unattractive to me so they can have a corporate job doing what they have to do but then as long as they have some
(2:03:15) passion and something that they genuinely love and care about that's a good place to start but I do I'm learning as I get older need somebody
(2:03:22) who's incredibly intelligent because being intellectually stimulated for me I need that in a relationship I could not
(2:03:28) marry somebody that I can't have deep theological conversations with or talk about law or talk about things so to I
(2:03:35) just keep making the and I'm 5 foot n so those circles is a little bit small I'm saposexual so I'm completely attracted
(2:03:42) to what does that mean saposexual SE saposexual means you're it means you're attracted to men that are intelligent or
(2:03:49) intelligence in general I think it's just good tast IQ test any of your previous like boyfriends or anything no
(2:03:55) well the last one like the only one he was smart but he was like had like um have you ever dated a guy who like when
(2:04:02) he's reading he's reading a book he has to like follow with his finger oh no you
(2:04:07) know them yeah yeah I haven't dat one of those I think I think I would sometimes I do that on menu I can't lie me too on
(2:04:16) menus I just got to make sure the ingredients are for which dish you know yep um but so uh
(2:04:22) would you date a guy who you said you got to date a guy who's passionate right would you date a guy who's passionate about anarcho
(2:04:30) capitalism in girl language please uh wait aren't you you uh you
(2:04:36) don't you have a degree in political science yeah we did not learn about anarch capitalism anarcho Capital yeah
(2:04:42) anarcho anarcho capitalism the idea of of let's a fair capitalism I believe
(2:04:48) that it's like kind of Liber sort not it's not libertarian but it's like it is libertarian for sure but it's different
(2:04:54) than libertarian though no I mean it's it's a pinnacle of most Libertarian beliefs of some sort of
(2:05:00) anarcho capitalism the idea that the market is never regulated or restrained uh because Goods will reduce in pricing
(2:05:06) if you don't do that so would you date somebody who's passionate about anarcho capitalism I
(2:05:13) mean that just sounds like a weirdo honestly um I was thinking more like
(2:05:18) cars or music or what if they're really passionate about
() 
(2:05:24) CA Harris 2028 um I unfortunately don't think that would work because I only date um men who are masculine and I've
(2:05:32) never heard of a masculine man who voted for Camel to what about like Arnold Schwarzenegger though he uh Camelot got
(2:05:39) the endorsement like would you date like young Arnold and would he still be a Comm
(2:05:45) supporter get to the job yeah I would never dat anybody who voted for KLA Harris or Joe Biden for that matter because I think it means they have
(2:05:51) horrible Jud J and I also think that to have a to have ideological similarities and
(2:05:58) have the samees you forgot your hat this match is my top perfect thank you I
(2:06:04) needed this would you guys who here would date a trump supporter going around the
(2:06:10) table um I don't I would not I don't mind is your boyfriend a he

(2:06:25) or not really can I have you just scoot your mic that way a little bit what about you would you date a trump
(2:06:30) supporter um I'm not too into politics so so yes I guess if he doesn't inflict
(2:06:36) his views on me and he does inflict he inflicts there's a lot of infliction we don't need no controlling
(2:06:43) partner okay that all right what about you 100% 100% okay did you vote for um
(2:06:50) kany or who did you vote for you seem like a Kanye voter no I'm 100% I love
(2:06:56) Trump yeah fix what about you great I would you are you a trumpy or I don't I
(2:07:03) don't know I'm like a Libertarian I'm I'm dating someone that's very very very anarco capitalist I guess
(2:07:10) so you're dating somebody who's very what liberal wait you're dating why would you do that it's just you know we met in
(2:07:17) 2010 he yeah can you go right into the mic right in the mic yeah you're a little
(2:07:22) quiet so we need you like right on the mic sorry yeah I don't know all we all he does is talk about politics to be
(2:07:27) honest and I kind of keep quiet oh B okay there you go did you
(2:07:34) vote did you vote too or I wasn't registered I just moved to California oh okay all right all right um which also
(2:07:42) fine you didn't you didn't vote right I didn't so if you so yeah so if you
(2:07:47) didn't vote then you didn't nullify the vote of any of the good Trump supporters so I mean you did good you did good thing all right and uh so in any case
(2:07:55) I've been single for 6 months uh any prospects though are any guys kind of in the picture oh for me yeah for you
(2:08:01) Deborah honestly no I mean there may be people that I know that I think are whatever you said before that I think
(2:08:07) could be good men but I'm a big believer and I don't know if it's just me this might be like a popular thing but I
(2:08:13) don't really waste my time and unless like the person I'm meant to be with is a very specific kind of person that
(2:08:18) wouldn't just fit any box they would fit my box and I can usually tell that even I a date with them unless they're truly
(2:08:26) that I can see myself Maring and building a life with like I'm I'm really only dating for that okay um would you
(2:08:34) date Matt Gates absolutely not are there any are there any politicians why why
(2:08:40) not why wouldn't you date Matt Gates is he I well he's married that's first off okay but if
(2:08:45) he um just I don't know legally you you got
(2:08:52) like your eye on anybody or in like you know in the political sphere well being
(2:08:57) that's another thing like I can only marry somebody who's Jewish and I wish there was more you know conservative Jews that's in Judaism you can only
(2:09:04) marry another Jew it's just like part of Judaism well I mean it depends if if is
(2:09:10) it religious are you saying from the religious perspective or from the ethnic perspective because my understanding is
(2:09:15) from the ethnic perspective fromn Jewish women are the most likely in fact to uh marry outside of uh of of other Jews
(2:09:24) well there has been the biggest thing is that the majority of Jews are reform which means that they don't observe much
(2:09:30) of Judaism they're Jewish ethnically but a race religion ethnicity everything so for me I I was raised modern Orthodox
(2:09:36) which is pretty religious I you know love Shabbat kosher everything like that she you're she you're practicing yes I'm
(2:09:42) pretty religious so therefore I need a husband who can rap to fillan every morning take the kids to Yeshiva would
(2:09:49) you ever would you ever convert to Christianity would never I love being Jewish so so you wouldn't date so you wouldn't date uh any Christians then I
(2:09:56) wouldn't date them to marry them but I do have a soft spot in my heart for Christian men I love them I don't know
(2:10:02) why they're just really like around with them but you wouldn't marry one well wait what was the question you'd like
(2:10:09) mess around with one but you wouldn't no like maybe I'd flare with one here and there but I wouldn't like seriously date
(2:10:15) them because again for me it's about marriage and I'm sure being busy a lot of guys experien this and women too but
(2:10:22) I have so much going on at all times that for me the time that I have to put towards somebody else I want to make sure that they're really worth it and I
(2:10:29) just I it's pretty easy for me to tell right away within like the first even few minutes of meeting somebody if I would ever want to date them because I'm
(2:10:35) not looking for a mans I'm looking for a husband Del leader provider in not just a financial sense but like in every
(2:10:41) sense of like a true biblical man and he hasn't come around there's not there's not a lot of um like the the idea here
(2:10:50) of of practice iing practi even practicing Orthodox Jews are mostly progressives in the United States yeah
(2:10:56) it's about 2 to 3% who are Orthodox modern Orthodox with about 98% being liberal it makes it even smaller yeah I
(2:11:04) yeah I understand that now you have a dual citizenship you thought about an Israeli husband I do not have dual citizenship I don't know why you would
(2:11:09) think that I did I I'm sorry I thought I read that in the the last Super Chat that you had dual citizenship oh well
(2:11:14) that's probably a troll a lot of people love to say because I'm Jewish and American that I have dual loyalties to Israel but I am only an American citizen
(2:11:22) um I only have his American citizenship but I do love Israel men I'm sorry iing to make ACC I don't think it was an
(2:11:27) nefarious question I think you just read whatever but I do love Israeli men I think they're great I would marry an Israeli absolutely okay all right and uh
(2:11:37) let's see here we do have a chat from Lucas what weirdo literally uh Javier
(2:11:46) mle calls himself an anarco capitalist often attributed to Austrian School of Economics Mar and Roth Roth Bard but
(2:11:53) dudes like Michael malice Dave Smith love the concept I debated Dave Smith on Pier's Morgan's show if that's the
(2:11:59) representation of anarch capitalism then I very much would never date somebody because everything he said he was like
(2:12:05) the Iranian people they hate Israel like the Iranian people have been oppressed by an Islamic regime women can't talk
(2:12:11) anymore they were on the beaches 40 years ago the Iranian people do not support Jihad they want freedom and he's
(2:12:17) like oh yeah you're probably right we can't we can't dive in to this topic no
(2:12:22) I'm not diving in I'm just was giving the example of Dave just completely switching his opinion in that moment um
(2:12:28) but I do know Dave Smith uh pretty well I've debated with him myself uh this was
(2:12:33) Christian ethics versus libertarianism um I are you saying you
(2:12:39) beat Dave Smith in a debate no it wasn't a beat I said if that was a representation of an an capitalist then
(2:12:44) absolutely not I wouldn't date them because it seems that they don't really have a backbone but bless his heart yeah
(2:12:51) he's a real smart guy as far as I know all right cool uh we have a chat
(2:12:56) here from the great Stiffler ask everyone we have to you know what we're going to wait until uh
(2:13:03) we have the full panel here so we'll come right back to that one but getting back into some of the notes I'm going to
(2:13:09) try to finish the notes then we'll get into the questionnaires so uh let's see
(2:13:14) we have Gina yes Gina yeah uh you've only dated two men in your entire life
(2:13:20) yeah we went over for that um you're super Territorial and jealous wait what
(2:13:26) right just super Territorial and jealous no no no oh the men were the men you dated were like my yeah yeah my my ex I
(2:13:34) guess I see wait we should play prank on your friend you take her seat and then she I just want you want to take her
(2:13:39) seat really I'm just curious okay me yeah like take her seat why I don't know just do it she's going to be like this
(2:13:46) do a little Switcheroo okay uh you also said modern dating is not really your cup of tea like meeting people online or
(2:13:52) through messages is kind of weird granted you've been in two kind of backto back long-term relationships
(2:13:58) right so let's see uh you also like you you wanted to speak on hookup culture
(2:14:03) you had opinions on only fans opinions on sneaky links LOL if you can just scoot to the table a
(2:14:09) little more but yeah go ahead so what's the question like oh uh I mean so your opinion on only fans is anybody wait
(2:14:16) you're the only one that does o right I don't actually do I just post pictures you're too far just remind you you got
(2:14:21) be i t you speak guess yes um nobody else here does only fans no only do
(2:14:27) something called Sex Panther ever ever ever you do sex work though right yeah okay um what's your opinion on only fans
(2:14:34) oh no you you guys asked me like what type of topics that's like the topics I chose I don't really have any tilt the mic down just a little bit yeah I don't
(2:14:41) really have any like opinions I just wanted to like you know that was just like a topic I threw up there okay uh
(2:14:47) all right then I guess moving on to cie cie over here uh you're we already talked about the
(2:14:54) professional hot girl Shape Shifter uh you said you've practiced non- monogamy for years you have lots of unique dating
() 
(2:15:00) experiences and stories more so recently since being separated and dating as single instead of married uh you
(2:15:06) experience men trying to jump right into a relationship with you after even the first or second date and and you think
(2:15:13) that this is really strange I do have a question for you on this um so what
(2:15:19) would you prefer then like they just keep you in a situationship for 6 months while [ __ ] three other
(2:15:25) women I mean I like taking the time to get to know someone especially because I have a child in the picture I feel like
(2:15:31) it's really important for me to fully vet someone before investing myself in them and my daughter's life um so it's
(2:15:38) really important to me to take my time to get to know someone and I think it's weird if they just want to like jump right into a relationship with me
(2:15:45) because it just seems like they just want to own me they don't really care about getting to know me they don't care about knowing if we're compatible I know
(2:15:51) what they bring to the table for me and my daughter so can you just tilt your mic down just a bit so um but wouldn't
(2:15:56) this be difficult to begin with because you're polyamorous right so I mean that's kind of off the table right what
(2:16:02) do you mean well I mean like they want to be um well I guess they could jump
(2:16:07) right into a polyamorous relationship with you right right but I mean I I'm
(2:16:12) not totally sure like what is the difference between dating
(2:16:19) somebody and being in the po like like just what's the what changes once you
(2:16:24) become in a relationship you know there's boundaries and expectations like any relationship only difference is you
(2:16:30) have that to multiple people but that could have boundaries on the second date with
(2:16:36) somebody when have you ever done that I do it all the time how give me examples
(2:16:41) what do you mean I say things things like I don't want you to date other people right on the second date yeah
(2:16:49) yeah sure even on the first date even before I meet them well I know this is funny to you
(2:16:54) because uh okay I'm not going to well I know this is funny to you but uh yeah
(2:17:01) that's really interesting why is that interesting I mean I just I disagree um
(2:17:06) sure that's fun you know I have um a child in the picture and I learned a lot
(2:17:11) from my previous marriage um what I don't want in a partner and I want to make sure that doesn't happen to me
(2:17:16) again um and I feel like you know maybe the problem with that was um you know we rushed right into a
(2:17:23) relationship without really taking the time to get to know each other um and I regret that you know I love my daughter
(2:17:29) I don't regret her for one second she's one of the best things that's ever happened to me but um yeah I really want
(2:17:35) to take my time getting to know people and I also I feel like I just have a very relaxed approach to dating like I'm like I'm down to get to know you and see
(2:17:42) where it goes um but yeah um yeah I'll give you a quick example though at least
(2:17:47) for for me so if I go on the first date with a girl for example and I'm interest in pursuing her like an immediate
(2:17:52) boundary I'd put down is if you want a second date there can't be other men in the picture you got to have no roster right
(2:18:00) basically much how do you know that from the first date well I mean I would even before meeting her I might like I might
(2:18:06) ask are there other men in the picture are you dating other men and if there are I'm very unlikely to even go on the
(2:18:13) date well that's interesting I mean I'm just I'm not monogamous and I haven't
(2:18:19) never been so I guess I don't really understand but it's just not how my brain works well I mean I know it's not
(2:18:25) what you do but like certainly you could understand that for example for somebody who's inclined towards monogamy uh the
(2:18:31) idea for example having sex with somebody while they're having sex with someone else might be disgusting yeah
(2:18:37) for me that would beus I mean you know Everyone's entitled to their opinion well I don't think it's opinion I
(2:18:43) actually do think it's a fact for two people to be simultaneous like it's like a standard in in so far as like the STD
(2:18:49) risk I mean STD are disgusting so I mean that's actually like a boundary of mine is I don't hook up with someone or I'm
(2:18:56) not you know sexually involved with them unless we've both been tested and they show that to me so that was always par
(2:19:03) always that's always been your standard always been the case you've never had a spontaneous sexual encounter no you've
(2:19:08) never had a SP no not not since you know I mean the past 5 years into now okay
(2:19:14) what about before then I mean when I was younger You' had spontaneous sexual encounters that did not include let's go
(2:19:20) get the D test but you have had them right I'm not it's not a knock people do
(2:19:26) it all the time but you have had spontanous yeah but like we're talking about right now so I'm not really sure
() 
(2:19:31) why that matters sure well I'm happy to engage with you even when it comes to your current standard um so even if you
(2:19:38) have an STD test there could be a false negative there could be a false positive certain things might not come up on the
(2:19:43) STD test also most people aren't taking full panel SD test they might do like goria chlamydia I'm aware huh I'm aware
(2:19:51) yeah like they're not really like I'm pretty sure like if you go to your doctor like hey can I get an STD test
(2:19:56) they're not checking for HPV they're not checking for herpes sometimes these things don't even show up on an STD test
(2:20:01) frankly like the STDs you ought to be concerned about are the permanent ones HPV uh herpes HSV so um these are not
(2:20:10) typically tested for although like chamian gona that would suck to get these are treatable they're curable
(2:20:16) that's typically what they're testing for they're typically not going to test for like really the major one which is
(2:20:22) like going to be herpes I mean I AG HPV is the one that causes cerv cervical cancer in women I know a lot of women
(2:20:28) get the uh the the jab for that one but um it still doesn't necessarily it it
(2:20:34) reduces your risk of getting cervical cancer uh but in in any case
(2:20:40) um I'm not sure if like the the STD test is going to be like a 100 fullprof plan for protecting you from STDs and if
(2:20:47) you're like engaging in sexual conduct with like multip mle multiple people it like does increase your risk of STD so
(2:20:53) that's why it's disgusting just use condoms I mean well if you ask someone to get a test and a full panel which I'm
(2:21:00) full aware of I mean I'm not disagreeing with what you're saying yeah you know like most panels that people get don't
(2:21:05) include that unless you specifically ask for it and it's a blood test of course it's different I'm aware of that I'm not
(2:21:11) disagreeing with you but um yeah I mean you know and use protection on top of
(2:21:16) that so I mean even if you use protection though like I mean is the big
(2:21:22) one like it can be on other parts of the
(2:21:27) pubic private area yeah I mean my mom has it and my best friend has it so I'm very aware of what it is and you know
(2:21:35) cont indications and how it's transmiss and how it affects people in their life something I'm very aware of so I
(2:21:41) practice safe sex always how can you I mean when it comes to herpes how can you practice safe sex you ask for a test you
(2:21:48) know I know but like wearing a condom is not going to prevent you from getting Herbies so if they have
(2:21:56) a rash you would be able to see that you know and it could be presymptomatic mhm or in their mouth I mean it's more
(2:22:02) likely to be transmiss if they have an why I don't Su disgusting yeah yeah but like
(2:22:09) in I mean I'm not really sure why my sex life is interesting to you can we talk
(2:22:14) about something else I mean it's can you stop sexualizing me how am I sexualizing you asking about my sex life how would
() 
(2:22:22) that be sexualizing you you're on a dating podcast to talk about dating related topics I said I'm happy to talk
(2:22:27) about other things this just seems like a weird topic how is it how's a weird topic I just feel like this is really
(2:22:34) what you want to talk about you know I've said my St you just okay then go ahead keep
(2:22:39) talking anything else you'd like to I mean you were so you were asking me the
(2:22:44) the Genesis of this conversation was you asked me hey uh this is not how I
(2:22:50) operate in my relationships and then I was like giving you an example of oh it's a rap I don't like if I you want a
(2:22:57) second date with me you can't be seeing other men and one of the reasons for this and I have a couple reasons but one
(2:23:02) of the main reasons is uh if she's sleeping with another guy there's a higher risk of getting an STD and it's
(2:23:10) even if even if she's sleeping with a man she doesn't have an STD he doesn't have an STD it's still the thought of it
(2:23:16) is disgusting I mean you're entitled to your opinion well again I don't think it's opinion I just think it's fact like
(2:23:23) the idea of another man's seen being Insider and then I'm F that's disgusting it's a really weird way to look at it
(2:23:28) buddy I mean how why is it weird I mean she's your object you own her after you a first date with her no but I mean it's
(2:23:35) like implying that okay she's mine I want to be the only penis that goes inside her monogamous relationship yes
(2:23:43) yes same if you want to call that controlling that I don't want my girl like the girl I'm dating I don't want
(2:23:49) her to [ __ ] other men if you want to call it controlling then I'm controlling like I personally wouldn't want my boyfriend [ __ ] other bit disagree
(2:23:56) that's your opinion you ask my opinion how controlling how's that controlling though I don't understand that's my
(2:24:01) opinion to me and the way I live my life is different and that's okay we can agree to disagree B girl person is gross
(2:24:08) too I think it's gross too so there we go cosign from a woman yeah because I would hate for my boyfriend to be
(2:24:13) [ __ ] random [ __ ] raw and then coming home and [ __ ] me and that's disgusting I don't want taking somebody
(2:24:19) else and then and me after words like the [ __ ] sorry this is I just can't do that um okay I'm
(2:24:25) monogan count Matthew uncore dore2 donated
(2:24:31) $200 shalom shalom Deborah I love you Brian Andrew I stand in battle with you
(2:24:38) to the wooers I rebuke you in the name of the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob
(2:24:43) search no La is higher than truth good night yo uh count count Matthew thank
(2:24:50) you the TTS man I really appreciate it yeah I wasn't trying to attack you but you were just asking like why I might
(2:24:56) even after a first date already start being like don't want you seeing other
(2:25:01) men that's one of the reasons and also I want a woman's uh exclusive romantic and
(2:25:08) sexual attention immediately like as soon as possible I think that's how
(2:25:13) dating should always be personally I think it's the best way and I've said this my whole life my last relationship
(2:25:19) we started officially dating after 2 weeks after we met and I think that's and then we only broke up a few months
(2:25:24) later because in that time we really got to know each other see if it was compatible or not really give it a Best Shot to see if we could fall in love and
(2:25:30) ultimately decided it just wasn't a perfect match and I think modern day where you're dating a bunch of people and you're having all these partners and
(2:25:37) you just really don't give that opportunity to see if you can really fall in love that leads to a lot of premature breakups or problems and
(2:25:43) personally not even sex I would never like I don't like going out with people who are going out with other people
(2:25:49) because it's just a sign of lack of seriousness if you have five people on your list you're not giving that same
(2:25:54) level of attention and well I totally agree it's so important to like really who your partner is going to be who your
(2:26:00) husband's going to be is like the most important decision a woman can make in her whole life nobody should take that lightly like we should definitely all do
(2:26:07) expert research find out if they're into some for sure make sure they don't want to bark like a dog first off but aside
(2:26:12) from that I really I understand that but I also think for me as a monogamous person that just icks me out too like
(2:26:18) why would I want to go out with somebody who's taking 20 other girls out he clearly doesn't care that much about me and I know a lot of girls who go on like
(2:26:25) multiple dates in one day and I always say to them like how can you even really give your full energy attention and
(2:26:31) really think about what do I like about this guy because you know if one little thing doesn't go right instead of really
(2:26:37) thinking like oh maybe it was a weird fluke or maybe I have to learn more about this you're like whatever I have another date later today so I wish
(2:26:43) everybody would be monogamous I think hinge and social media and all these dating apps have encouraged people to not be monogamous they've done the
(2:26:49) opposite effect where people think they have unlimited options they can just swipe through oh my girlfriend dummy that's fine I can literally get any
(2:26:56) random girl to have sex with off my phone I don't even have to leave my house I could Uber her over here and I think it's one of the worst things to
(2:27:01) ever happen to Modern relationships and the marriage rates and the level of children and everything like that has
(2:27:07) reflected that that is truth and rates goes up hold on but so and I mean that's
(2:27:13) a that's a great Point de and this was pretty much the standard up until about maybe like 20 years ago I think this is
(2:27:19) how most people moved it was like okay you kind of date one person at a time if it works
(2:27:24) great if it doesn't next one now people are like yeah I mean now people are uh you know well what about having platonic
(2:27:31) friends like how is that how's that relevant to the conversation it's not well if it's not romantic like you said
(2:27:37) a woman shouldn't have any any guys in their life is I didn't say that okay well I just mean a separate conversation
(2:27:44) I typically would prefer a woman to not have a bunch of male friends yeah yeah
(2:27:51) um I don't think it's necessarily a deal breaker but I mean obviously she cannot be like friends with her ex-boyfriend
(2:27:58) you have to be like uh what's what's the term like uh no contact no contact with
(2:28:04) with like prior sexual partners that that is but what about if she has like a
(2:28:09) baby dting the guy's okay dating her but they can't really connect cut that core but they don't really want to be like
(2:28:15) close with the baby daddy they speak straight into the mic they don't want to be close with baby daddy but they they still have to have that connection due
(2:28:21) to a well I mean yeah in that case you're forced but I mean uh I think doesn't mean Brian marry
(2:28:27) her uh I mean I I think there are like typic generally there's there are like
(2:28:33) women who are single moms who are fantastic or whatever who would make good partners but generally speaking I
(2:28:38) think if you're uh a single guy you don't have children I do think it's going to be a suboptimal dating choice
(2:28:44) if you have other options to date a single mom but look there's uh single moms out there who are wonderful but
(2:28:51) often times a lot of men have reported to me in my own experiences uh typically these are these relationships are a
(2:28:57) little more difficult there's other concerns there the like you said the you
(2:29:03) have to like consider okay are they single mom say it too right right I mean single moms themselves report that these
(2:29:09) are these are tougher relationships right and that the recommendation uh that you're going to
(2:29:14) get into something like that it's going to be it's it's going to be tough right it's going to be tough I mean it uh both
(2:29:20) sides know that that's the case yeah anytime children are involved I think it just makes it adds an extra layer there
(2:29:27) yeah course someone said that it's like dating two people but not actually dating a child it's just like getting to know two different people and do
(2:29:33) different personalities and yeah more complex but uh yeah I mean if uh if I'm
(2:29:41) interested in a girl I mean obviously the context in which we meet is going to matter but I mean I would probably like
(2:29:48) vet them before I even go on the first date to see if it's it's even worth my time like I know it's maybe some people
(2:29:54) are like H kind of whimsical about it they don't really care I'll go on this date whatever for me I will actually do
(2:29:59) quite a bit of vetting before I even want to meet up with them I'm going to ask them a bunch of questions some people might think oh this is like
(2:30:05) Autistic or whatever but whatever I don't care like I'm just going to maximize my time I'm it's not worth it
(2:30:12) for me to go on a date with somebody and then get on the date and it's like oh okay well our values are totally mismatched here I'm say I'm going to
(2:30:18) save you time save myself Time by figuring these things out before we even meet in person um if she's like dating
(2:30:25) three other men even if she's not having sex with them not interested if she's having sex with one guy not interested
(2:30:31) total deal deal breaker just goodbye have a question for you where do you meet most of these women
(2:30:36) cuz I think it matters if it's somebody that you're meeting either online or a random person versus like being set up
(2:30:43) by somebody that you have mutual friends with and stuff like you can already know like where do you meet the most honestly want everybody besides the relationship
(2:30:49) girls to answer that like where do you meet girls Brian uh well so there's like there's uh
(2:30:55) we're putting Brian on the spot to I mean there there's postp podcast pre podcast uh and I mean a lot of my
(2:31:02) experiences have been informed by my like pre- podcast dating experiences where like I was on dating apps and all
(2:31:08) this stuff and I remember one time for example I was on a date with this girl and I met her on hinge she had just
(2:31:14) downloaded the app and then it like within a week I was on a date with her
(2:31:20) and she told me oh yeah I've already been on three dates I'm dating and I have like five dates scheduled for next week I'm like oh okay thank you for
(2:31:25) telling me that it was nice meeting you but not interested um so I've had a lot of experiences there uh post podcast
(2:31:33) it's mostly been women contacting me that's like a way Superior position to like if somebody's trying to get at you
(2:31:40) it's just like a much better position to be in so that's probably most not most men's experiences but um in that
(2:31:47) situation it's actually exceptionally easily easy to vet and like you can basically bust out the girlfriend
(2:31:53) application be like answer this I don't there's not there's not a girlfriend application but it's like if somebody's
(2:31:59) coming to you you can be like really selective and be like okay let me ask you like a million questions and so
(2:32:04) forth but if you're on a dating app aren't you like expected for all the women on there to have like a whole
(2:32:09) roster basically cuz that's what it's for yeah I mean if you're on the dating app definitely you have to have like
(2:32:16) most of the women on there probably are dating multiple men yeah there's a good chance probably [ __ ] at least one other
(2:32:22) dude uh I was on the dating apps for a while uh so
(2:32:29) yeah yep so I hate dating apps I don't like them it's hard for me to like kind
(2:32:34) of speak on this but I mean I think you there are good women on
(2:32:39) on the dating apps but it's like you got to kind of shift through it's like diamond in the rough or what what I said
(2:32:45) you wouldn't date a woman who has like multiple dates yeah but that's kind of
(2:32:50) like what it what the app is for to get like multiple dates well I mean you can be on the dating apps and like not
(2:32:57) trying to like squeeze in seven dates a week there are women on the dating apps who are a bit more selective and you
(2:33:03) know you can find that girl who's like not just like jumping at every single date uh but I would say the majority of
(2:33:11) the women on the dating apps probably like dating multiple guys probably the majority of the men though on dating
(2:33:17) apps started specifically looking for hookups and that's why I don't like dating because they look especially like Hench it was the only dating app that I
(2:33:23) said I would download and I tried it out and I'd find some good guys there that Wen only looking for sex but majority of
(2:33:28) them was like oh you want to um can I come over can you come over I'm just like you said hi to me bro like and you're already expecting sex for me
(2:33:35) donated $269 thanks bricken and Andrew for God's
(2:33:40) work I need Betty buys really hope I wake up to see that chair one crella
(2:33:46) DeVille 304 and six Norman bites 304 Rage Quit good luck boys God speed
(2:33:55) 07 yeah Lord Jesus thank you for the uh TTS man really appreciate it uh okay
(2:34:01) once nobody go check on her huh nobody go check on her uh you can no it's okay um let's see where were we we're talk oh
(2:34:09) we're getting into your notes um you said your hot take on dating is that most men date for sport you believe for
(2:34:15) the feeling of obtaining a woman and the gratification of that but not necessarily dating for getting to know
(2:34:20) someone or being chill about that yeah I mean that's just my experience with someone wanting to jump right into a
(2:34:26) relationship without taking the time to get to know me you know after the first date I feel like to men they see women
(2:34:32) as a trophy to obtain you know and then once they get you that's it they don't have to continue putting in the work I
(2:34:37) mean that was my experience in my 5-year marriage okay you know certified
(2:34:43) lever I'm really uh and you're currently like you're so you're paully you're in you do the open relationship thing um
(2:34:50) how many people are you currently dating I'm not dating anyone I'm focusing on getting divorced I'm focusing on getting
(2:34:55) my life together yeah but are you like uh okay how about like casual sex then I don't have casual sex with anyone uh
(2:35:01) semi-serious sex no are there any guys in the picture in any romantic capacity
(2:35:07) or sexual capacity whatsoever no oh okay all right uh so
(2:35:14) you're celibate for a period you've been celibate for four months
() 
(2:35:20) um I mean I definitely have hooked up with someone that I was seeing for a couple months um but it was not great um
(2:35:29) yeah so haven't seen anyone since then how many um any one given time what's
(2:35:37) the most amount of men that you've been seeing in some capacity oh you're B uh you date women
(2:35:44) too so I suppose I mean the most Partners like for me that's that's i max
(2:35:50) out at as three like three Partners romantically involved with dating in
(2:35:55) relationships with and that's it for me I mean I'm not like someone who just needs a bunch of Partners or needs a
(2:36:02) bunch of attention I mean I don't go on a bunch of dates I don't have time to do that so when I do I mean it's you know
(2:36:08) something I care about and it's something I take very seriously um but right now I mean for me
(2:36:14) it's just very casual and I explain that you know I'm open to healthy connection and experience es so I'm down to go like
(2:36:22) hang out with people and go on walks and go on picnics and you know go on Hikes but I'm not interested in dating anyone
(2:36:28) right now or being in a relationship okay
(2:36:33) um and let me see here uh sorry there's a couple things going
(2:36:39) on behind the scenes um let's see I don't know how people have enough like time in their day to be
(2:36:46) in a relationship with three different people I feel like one boyfriend is a fulltime job plus having child I
(2:36:52) understand how people do that yeah well when I left my husband I also broke up with other partners I had CU I realized
(2:36:58) like I really need to focus on my life and her life and you know figuring out what that looks like for us so um yeah I
(2:37:04) mean I identify as polyamorous but you know I'm single and I'm also like open to talking to people and getting to know
(2:37:11) people but um I'm not trying to be in a relationship right now but I enjoy getting to know people you know and
(2:37:17) being okay sure uh and you said you are your bipan
(2:37:22) queer and you have better luck with queer people when it comes to dating casually yeah are you and are you so you
(2:37:28) are pant so you'll date uh you'll date men you'll date women you'll date trans men you'll date trans women do I have
(2:37:33) that correct correct and nonbinary and non-binary okay uh so they thems more
(2:37:39) love babies shout out to my VES they what is Vapes VES like they babes what's
(2:37:45) that like like a babe but a they them babe so a they
(2:37:50) all right I think Ally taught us that last time Allie is a certified certified
(2:37:56) 247 I think certifi title yeah so uh I do I did want
(2:38:02) to ask you and I uh well since it's since the Topic's
(2:38:07) already come up um although you didn't you didn't seem to disagree on this one Cali right yeah um it's not wrong to not
(2:38:16) want to date a trans person I mean I think everyone entitled to their opinions and if you're not you know
(2:38:22) attracted to a queer person or their you know gender identity that's fine and
(2:38:28) that's your choice okay all right because we have had some people on the show who say well it would be uh
() 
(2:38:34) discriminatory or transphobic or wrong to refuse to date somebody because they're trans I think it's technically
(2:38:40) still queer in my opinion wait what do you mean like I think you know if you're
(2:38:46) with a trans person I think you identify as queer right yeah not straight but I
(2:38:51) don't I don't really understand that aspect of it because you clearly you can be a trans person and be heterosexual so
(2:38:59) so because that's doesn't that actually defeat the meaning of lgbtq which is the idea of samees seex relationships
(2:39:08) right I mean I'm honoring their gender identity you know but I think even that
(2:39:13) can be even if you did the gender identity thing you would still have to consider that to be heterosexual if it
(2:39:19) was if they were if they both identified as opposite genders right so if that's the case I still don't I even even
(2:39:25) granting that I still don't understand how it's actually how how they actually go under the umbrella of lgbtq yeah I mean you just asked my
(2:39:33) opinion that's your opinion yeah but that's that's what I'm asking
(2:39:40) h h h okay
(2:39:46) um so wait uh and I I think you didn't even disagree on this one but just want to double check uh it's not straight for
(2:39:53) a man to date a trans woman you you agree with that I think it's qu
(2:40:01) in my opinion she agrees okay she agre yes all right okay let me see here if we have
(2:40:08) anybody who we did have Emily you disagreed on that one wait what what was
(2:40:15) even the yeah so it was the statement was that you agreed on it's not straight
(2:40:21) for a man to date a trans woman yeah I don't think it's straight I also think it's
(2:40:26) queer you you circled that you disagreed but you
(2:40:33) agree yes that is not straight oh sugar is Big Gay okay I
(2:40:39) think I cired that too maybe because I do agree that is it it is gay to dat a person as trans I think we say queer
(2:40:45) queer oh sorry that's okay wait why would it be queer I thought you said we don't say that
(2:40:51) word on here oh no you can I mean well gay in this cont if you're using it as
(2:40:57) an insult yeah if it's like an insult yeah oh no it was just in the disclaimer of words we don't say no it's fine like
(2:41:02) respect for my transgender bu he always okay all right uh let's see here we do have uh we are going
(2:41:08) to uh get to stiffler's question then ask everyone to rate their own looks uh
(2:41:15) on a scale of 1 to 10 you want to take that one uh all
() 
(2:41:21) right uh everyone rate their own looks on a scale of 1 to 10 starting with you go ahead think I solid eight okay in my
(2:41:29) opinion what about you like in my opinion yeah your looks on a scale of 1 to 10 like
(2:41:34) nine okay what the about you like a nine too n 9.10
(2:41:40) seven eight seven I'm a 10 baby remind you speaking
(2:41:46) to the mic okay oh seven all right Deborah I like to think somewhere between 7 and a half and 8 all right I
(2:41:52) give you're 10 stay humble you know always room to grow get skinnier yes exactly once I get the Snow Job watch
(2:42:01) out I give myself a five Andrew what about you well I mean with all the Nines in
(2:42:07) the room I couldn't be anything less than a 10 wait why why laughing why you
(2:42:14) laughing you guys don't think so no you're handsome yeah see
(2:42:19) there you go and then um all right and then I guess related to
(2:42:26) this question we do have uh do you think you'll be better looking in 10 years time so you're 26 will you be better
() 
(2:42:32) looking at 36 yes cuz hopefully a lot less stress I'm going to age backwards like Benjamin
(2:42:38) Button okay what about 20 years time 46 yes definitely I mean I take really good care of myself I work out all the
(2:42:45) time you know I have vitamins supplements um super greens super Reds magnesium I mean really everything you
(2:42:52) can think of so um 30 years time 56 yeah I'm going to be hot uh 40 years
(2:42:59) time 66 I mean I'll think I'll be maybe like a beautiful older woman like Audrey
(2:43:05) heern uh 50 years time 76 I mean hopefully my legs still
(2:43:12) work so okay the just a reminder the question is will you be do you think
(2:43:19) you'll be more attractive oh more attractive 10 years 20 years 30 years like oh like compared to now um yeah so
(2:43:26) you're 76y old s going be more hot I'm sorry I didn't understand the question okay it's okay um no I mean I think you
(2:43:35) know probably 10 years from now I'll be really hot and then I'll more hot yes more hot okay what about 20 years Time
(2:43:41) same um no I mean I think I think that's not really going to be my concern anymore just you know I'm not always
(2:43:47) going to be this young and sexy so I'm just enjoying it whether it's your concern or not is kind of irrelevant to
(2:43:52) the question yeah I mean I I don't I don't know haven't really thought about it I
(2:43:59) don't really care that much like I don't put that much emphasis on my looks you I
(2:44:05) care more about integrity why do you put hair color why do you dye your hair if you cute I'm a girl I like to be cute
(2:44:12) it's fun you do care about your looks I think it's fun it doesn't mean like that's know that's not like the most
(2:44:18) emphas put I guess I what I don't understand like in this you can't in the same sentence say I don't care about my
(2:44:24) looks but also like you wear makeup you put on fake lashes you do your hair you've got tattoos you clearly care care
(2:44:31) about your external physical appearance yeah I'm saying in that time like I will care a lot less about my looks like I
(2:44:38) said I'm not always going to be this young and beautiful like I'm not going to rely you know or care that much about this forever so all right uh you are we
(2:44:46) switched you you're 23 right or how old you 20 21 20 21 21 my bad I got a little
(2:44:52) confused there okay so 21 uh will you be better looking in 10 years time at 31 I feel like yes but now when I'm old so 20
(2:44:58) years time 41 41 yeah I feel like I'll still be hot uh 30 years time
(2:45:05) 51 I feel like once I get like a little older I would probably get work done just to look a little younger that's
(2:45:11) really it when when do you think you'll Peak Peak M probably like late 20s okay
(2:45:17) when do you think is like going to be your Peak like 35 35 okay going to you
(2:45:22) you're 23 better looking in 10 years time at 33 yes definitely I feel like I still haven't glown up like I want to
(2:45:28) sure okay better looking in 20 years time at 43 yes I'm Latina so I have really good jeans and my mom's beautiful
(2:45:34) and she's 51 so okay better looking in 30 years time at 53 yeah I believe so
(2:45:40) okay better looking in 40 years time at 63 um maybe I hope so like JLo and all
(2:45:46) of them well they're not 60 but you know they're older women think JLo's better looking now versus when she was no you
(2:45:53) think there's a single natural thing about her anymore anybody in Celebrity or anybody in Hollywood all these
(2:45:59) celebrities do everything from like the blood facials to I don't know sacri better now I feel like K Kardashian
(2:46:05) looks better now than she did when she was younger like starting out don't you agree she's also had probably millions of dollars of plastic surgery done to
(2:46:10) her so that's the point I guess it matters if you think plastic surgery is attractive or not not really I mean I
(2:46:16) want to know's job that's probably the only work I would get all right um 50 years time at uh
(2:46:23) 73 more attractive no not definitely not more attractive Peak Peak would be like
(2:46:28) in my 30s 30 mid 30s mid 30s all right what about you uh you are 22 right
(2:46:34) better looking in 10 years time at 32 yeah better looking 20 years time 42 yeah better looking 30 years time 52 no
(2:46:43) okay when's the peak I'd say like early 30s early 30s okay uh you are clarify I
(2:46:50) don't want to live past 60 thank you for sharing that very relevant piece of information uh you're 28 better looking
(2:46:56) in 10 years time at 38 uh no I I believe everybody Peaks when they're young like it's so you're sure let's go backwards
(2:47:03) uh you're 28 were you better looking at 18 than you are now I think I was looking the best like
(2:47:11) my Peak was like 23 okay but if we had to compare were you better looking at 18
(2:47:17) versus now yes okay yes all right and then uh you
(2:47:22) are you will be better looking now at 28 than you will be at 38 uh I don't know I guess we all age so
(2:47:29) I don't I don't I don't know how I'm going to look when I'm 38 I probably assuming you plus 10
(2:47:36) years I don't know it could be I could take control
(2:47:41) and look good or I could go to total [ __ ] who knows how people turn out what do you
(2:47:47) think I don't think I've ever thought about this so you're thinking about it right now uh I might look better I think
(2:47:55) yeah I could but you said 38 38 10 years time okay now you're old nobody find it
(2:48:02) weird she doesn't want to live past 60 am I the only one that caught that I got that too why because because our bodies
(2:48:08) are [ __ ] up by then like we like we break down I don't want to be all like I have like spine issue I don't really
(2:48:14) want to live well I mean maybe there'll be interventions within 30 30 40 years that will uh you know regen regenerative
(2:48:22) medicine this sort I hope so I hope something different uh so going to you
(2:48:27) you're 38 will you be better looking will you be better looking in 10 years time at 48 I like to be optimistic but I
(2:48:34) mean I don't know I want to get more fit I guess you know more strong let me know
(2:48:40) if you need a trainer okay so was sorry was that a yes or I don't think so I'm sorry you're
(2:48:46) very soft spoken realistically no probably will be a little less cuter okay and you're 38 uh are you better
(2:48:53) looking now or were you better looking 10 years ago at 28 just let me finish uh
(2:48:59) better looking at 28 probably a little better looking I kind of look the same and then uh were you better looking at
(2:49:05) 18 10 years prior as compared to 28 I would agree okay so okay all right uh
(2:49:12) Deborah you're 24 better looking in 10 years time at 34 I do think so okay and
(2:49:18) then better looking in 20 years time 44 better than right now yes probably not because I plan to have a ton of kids and
(2:49:24) I know what that does to a woman's body but a cold plunge I don't e seed oils I'm all about that RFK maybe RFK will
(2:49:30) make us all live forever so um and then just you uh between 34 and 44 which one
(2:49:36) will be better looking probably 34 I think early 30s is probably like the peak for women but my grandma's in her
(2:49:43) 80s and she's a hottie all right uh and then Daman let me know when we get the Discord going

(2:56:32) definitely woke and believe in um woke woke yeah like the Matrix about everything like I is there Third Eye
(2:56:38) Open The Matrix yeah like you mean we're living in mat simulation yeah a simulation wait really well not that we
(2:56:46) live in a simulation but I do believe that like we live in a matrix where like the um higher society makes us like in a
(2:56:51) programmation so how do how do we get unplugged I don't know yet you take the red pill I'll take the red pill you take
(2:56:58) the red pill I'll take the red pill but anyways going back to so right now just to be clear it's currently the year in the
(2:57:06) real world it's the year uh 2400 there's robots you are in like a liquefied human
(2:57:15) pod and the robots are using hold on the the robots are using you for essentially
(2:57:20) a battery to power no the robot world because there
(2:57:27) was a human robot war and uh the robots
(2:57:33) won and now we're the slaves of the robots of the robots and we're all
(2:57:38) inside of the Matrix right now no I do not believe that's not the point I was getting at just like the rat race trying
(2:57:44) to escape the matrix now working um like that that's strictly of like working at 95 so we're not literally in the Matrix
(2:57:50) we're that's program she saying she's talking about social programming okay yeah exactly thank you very much Andrew
(2:57:56) no but she said we're in a simulation so no I said not simulation no she actually said she she didn't think we were in a
() 
(2:58:02) simulation oh yeah that would be crazy I'm not that crazy simulation and then she's talking about social kind of like
(2:58:09) Andrew tape mindset I'm like the version like the woman version of Andrew Tate and yeah you're so you're a fan of Andrew Tate yes okay I used to not be
(2:58:16) cuz I don't like his views on woman but now that he changed his views on on women wa how did he change his views on women wait wait wait did he change his
(2:58:22) views on woman or on women Bo well I don't know the first I did not like Andrew Tate at first because the video I
(2:58:28) would see him like degrading woman um and acting like we're sexual objects and I was like yeah you're not my guy not
(2:58:34) woman I think he's kind of doubl down now he's like saying that women are the most beautiful creation on Earth and we
(2:58:40) need to take care of them and protect like okay I like paying them to have sex on webcams no I did not know about that
(2:58:47) that's how got his famous he has a whole program called a p uh PhD pimping hose degree where he teaches men how to get
(2:58:54) other women to film themselves naked on sex cams and get the money uh move yeah
(2:59:01) just to move things on okay I did not know that you said you're into I don't agree with that you're into manifest manifesting yeah what does that mean
(2:59:08) manifesting is what whatever like um you want in your life and your dreams you're able to manifest it and um eventually
(2:59:14) comes to fation if you follow like your path and stay true to yourself and obviously God pray to God and I feel
(2:59:23) like I've manifested a lot of things that I wanted like being in a medical field and my opportunities that I've
(2:59:28) asked once like for modeling it's like it happens okay uh and then you did write here when I was going around the
(2:59:34) table you said you're single right yes but in the notes you said you were in a very complicated situationship that was
(2:59:40) my ex you're no longer oh maybe this you sent this like a while ago so this is
(2:59:46) over do I have that correct yeah that situationship was over I see you said cuz you said you've been single for 2
(2:59:52) months so okay so you're no longer in the very complicated situation the this was the guy who cut your hair yes ah
(2:59:59) okay they all coming back together I see okay all right and we have uh who do we
(3:00:06) have Giana Gina me no there's oh no no okay
(3:00:11) that that's all right uh let's see here did did you send anything or no I don't think you did did you did mhm via
(3:00:18) Instagram or here yeah you already read them but they were just like oh you're right I didn't I didn't send anything sorry Ryan but I can whip it up right
(3:00:25) now we have uh the I think the final one then is we have uh tnie uh you just tnie
(3:00:31) you said you just ended a 9-year abusive relationship with your ex fiance who's
(3:00:36) now having severe health problems that's correct okay um actually yeah I'll leave
(3:00:44) it here for uh uh and just uh I don't know if can you give
(3:00:50) us a little details he's abusive was it physically emotionally it was physical
(3:00:55) it was emotional it lasted way too long I mean we met when I was 29 and now I'm
(3:01:01) 38 so my whole 30s he was also 12 years older than me
(3:01:06) and I agap different opinions on that now as an older woman I think um see
(3:01:11) yeah but it's very emotional cuz he is get close if you can uh has liver ceros
(3:01:16) and he has colon cancer on top of that so I'm so sad okay it's just shitty uh
(3:01:21) but so you said that you so you just ended the 9-year abusive relationship um how did you abuse him I was not the
(3:01:28) abusive one oh my bad sorry okay I miss I guess I missed that part um and uh you
() 
(3:01:35) were with him for nine years that is that correct that's correct okay uh you wanted to talk about narcissistic
(3:01:41) abuse uh so he was a narcissist I have been like reading a lot of books on
(3:01:46) narcissism and yeah just so it's a little simpler just scoot your chair in maybe if you un cross your legs you can
(3:01:53) would scoot that chair just get that okay there you go all right yeah I would categorize it as like a narcissistic
(3:02:00) abuse of how do you define narcissism I just want to make sure I'm understanding I um I've read like why does he do that
(3:02:07) and I've been listening to a lot of Dr robney and it's it's I I wouldn't have the
(3:02:12) definition uh yeah but I do feel like it did fit into that category
(3:02:19) MH quite a bit sorry okay was he diagnosed as a narcissist or no no okay
(3:02:27) Andrew typically has thoughts on this one I'll know Andrew if you want to have any inquiry here or yeah I was just
(3:02:34) curious um so I hear so many women say that men are narcissistic and yet these
(3:02:40) men have never been diagnosed with narcissism it seems that the women themselves tend to diagnose the men as
(3:02:45) being narcissistic all on their own and I'm just wondering how you came to the conclusion that he was
(3:02:51) narcissistic I feel like I I grew up with a covert narcissist mother um was
(3:02:56) she diagn I wish I was more I know she's not diagnosed but sorry I wish I was feeling more articulate um but yeah just
(3:03:03) like I said I've let spread the book why does he do that which was very insightful and I don't know if anyone's
(3:03:11) familiar with dror Romney the the Indian psychologist that has a YouTube channel that talks a lot about this yeah
(3:03:19) um you're right yeah well I'm just curious what are the traits that actually made this guy a
(3:03:25) narcissist I I don't actually I I don't know how to explain
(3:03:30) it completely totally L relationship I was
(3:03:36) never really listened to I don't I don't know I should have made more notes before I came here cuz I'm feeling like
(3:03:42) I don't know exactly what to say on that subject so
(3:03:49) sorry can I got a lot to say about narciss was Zach bran no anybody
(3:03:56) following that I love but that situation yeah well I mean so just by a show of
(3:04:02) hands real quick um who here has dated a narcissist I guess me diagnosed or
(3:04:09) diagnosed by women well just diagnosed by you mine was diagnosed by a doctor
(3:04:15) okay after just diagnosed by you or you you just think that they're a narcissist for whatever reason just bu a show of
(3:04:21) hands real quick wait what did you say yeah if you dated a narcissist I think a
(3:04:27) lot of women just use that term like it's like the term gaslighting people just took it and ran with it but people
(3:04:33) can be an [ __ ] or like a bad guy without being narcissist an actual narcissist you cannot feel or think
(3:04:39) about other people's emotions they could know about your emotions and just genuinely not care about them like that is I don't think that's necessarily
(3:04:45) narcissism I think there's just yeah like and there's women who are also really bad like it's just bad people is
(3:04:52) a psychopath and a narcissist the same thing no okay have you dated a
(3:04:57) psychopath besides the dog man oh well um the the one the your relationship was
(3:05:04) diagnosed as a narcissist and I've also dated a guy that was actually diagnosed as a psychopath but this is like way
(3:05:10) like when I was really young there's no diagnosis for psychopathy so psycho psychopath doesn't exist anywhere in the
(3:05:16) DSM it's not it's not a diagnosis there there's uh other diagnoses which you
(3:05:22) would give a person that you would possibly consider them to be a psychopath like borderline personality
(3:05:27) disorder cluster B all sorts of different things but psychopathy itself psych being a psychopath is not a thing
(3:05:34) which can be diagnosed interesting I was like 19 this guy told me he was actually diagnosed like as a psychopath I I don't
(3:05:41) know what thaten maybe maybe who knows I don't know that how old was he you were 19 he was like 23
(3:05:48) somewhere in there 24 girl you got to make better choices in men I'm sorry you just I'm not sorry actually I really
(3:05:54) think that you need to make better choices in men especially if you have a daughter because it's your duty to raise
(3:05:59) her and like teach her what men she should go for and I think it's never too late to make that better choice and live
(3:06:06) a happier better life but you got to put the effort in yeah I'm learning it's
(3:06:12) definitely yeah I agree with that statement all right um
(3:06:17) let's see here um uh one sec guys just going over a
(3:06:24) couple things okay um we're going to get into the uh questionnaire stuff but before we do I'm just going to read the
() 
(3:06:30) Super Chat from the the homie Ray bovis please have everyone pronounce the plural form of the word Woman Andrew is
(3:06:37) enthusiastic about this one starting with you go ahead I don't get the question
(3:06:42) women women what women women question I
(3:06:47) don't know what we're talking sorry the plural word yeah the plural form of the word
(3:06:54) woman woman women to the mic wom women women what well so you guys
(3:07:03) have and you you may not realize that you've done this but all of you have done this now when you say women you
(3:07:11) keep saying woman I don't think that woman should do this or to woman or like that what's
(3:07:19) that I don't believe I know the proper use of the terms I don't think I've said that but if anybody can answer
(3:07:25) woman yeah yeah but I but but yeah there's there's a lot of I don't I and I have no idea why this is it's something
(3:07:32) that I've seen panel after panel after panel for some reason women use the word
(3:07:37) woman to say women and I don't I don't actually understand why that is what's the difference the most bizarre
(3:07:42) phenomenon ever plural so like a woman and P versus
(3:07:48) a singular pan a woman is you where women is a yeah yes why I said
(3:07:54) that no no you specifically said woman like 15 times instead of women me oh no
(3:08:00) me I'm confused with this question woman yeah is English your second language
(3:08:06) well I had to learn English and Spanish at the same time cuz I moved to Mexico and I was in preschool so imagine having to learn your own language how to speak
(3:08:12) and write correctly and then add Spanish on top of that so I yeah but I mean in spanish isn't it Mo Hair Mo hairs yes
(3:08:21) is blond moment sorry all right well Brian's gone so we
(3:08:28) have to entertain ourselves now uh no no we can uh we can actually dive into a couple things so going back to the
() 
(3:08:34) rating thing briefly I'd like to do just a very quick social experiment uh so
(3:08:40) everybody close your eyes close them up tight close your eyes up tight okay now raise your hand if you
(3:08:47) think think you're the prettiest girl in the room nobody else can see I'm not going to
(3:08:54) participate okay now lower your hands now open your eyes okay now uh starting with chair one
(3:09:02) who do you think said that they were the prettiest woman in the room um I don't know I mean I think
(3:09:10) everyone really it's just there's no wrong answer in my opinion yeah I mean I think just who do
(3:09:17) you think raised her hand is all I'm just asking who you think raised but she's humble so I don't think she would have raised her hand I don't know okay
(3:09:26) next chair who do you think raised their hand um I don't think maybe you raised
(3:09:31) your hand but okay beautiful women so I was like I'm definitely not the
(3:09:36) prettiest girl in here so middle chair middle chair who do you think raised their hand um I don't feel like anyone
(3:09:44) did just kind of out of respect who do you think raise their
(3:09:50) hand uh I don't know that no one okay and the next chair who do you
(3:09:55) think rais her hand probably no one I would bet on that actually oh and then
(3:10:01) last chair who do you think rais your hand if I I agree with no one but if I had to say anyone I think it would be
(3:10:06) you just cuz I feel like you have a high level of self-confidence um but got it
(3:10:11) so two those now just since all your eyes are open raise your hand if you said nobody
(3:10:18) what do you mean you ra your hand yeah if you don't think anybody raised their hand raise your
(3:10:24) hand yeah okay great uh and so for those of you who just raised your hand how
(3:10:30) many of you rated yourselves as a seven or
(3:10:35) above everybody every so I I don't I don't understand if you're if you if you're 7 8 9 10 how do you assume that
(3:10:44) you're not the prettiest girl in the room cuz there's also seven nights and 10 sub such a subjective question I
(3:10:50) don't think I'm in competition with any other woman comp myself think it's a pret why is it a
(3:10:56) matter of comptition me too always I'm not the pretti look at her she's she's model material
(3:11:02) her she's beautiful yeah I'm not I'm not saying it's a matter of competition I'm saying that even from your subjective
(3:11:08) metric you can make a determination as to what is pretty and what is not pretty correct symmetrical face I think all the
(3:11:15) girls here are beautiful yeah nobody nobody's making nobody's disputing that you
(3:11:21) must for someone who's married I'm shocked that you don't have a better grasp on the female psychology when it comes to just this specific aspect where
(3:11:28) women when the environment is divisive and you're put in position to tear each
(3:11:34) other down women will claw each other's eyes out Li but like when they're in I think in good environments women tend to
(3:11:40) be girly and like Sisterhood and really like not want to tear people down I just came from a bachelorette trip everyone's
(3:11:46) like breeding their hair and do massages I'm like since when do we start doing this like I I think it's just a female
(3:11:54) thing that if we were all in a private room like a confessional as a person who's married and raised many many women
(3:12:00) who are out in society I also know that there's a lot of truth that perhaps um at the moment you're trying to Gaslight
(3:12:06) us away from which is that women often tear each other down in groups all the time they do it all the time nonstop and
(3:12:14) often in the most passive aggressive ways possible but the idea that you from your subjective metric can't make a
(3:12:20) determination as to which girl you think is prettier than you I think is a lie I literally think it's just a lie I I
(3:12:26) don't think you're any of you are actually telling me the truth right I think she's prettier than me I mean I'm gay and I gave my honest opinion so my
(3:12:33) honest opinion yeah right well I mean some of you will say sure some of the women here are prettier than me blah
(3:12:38) blah blah but many don't want to answer they don't want to answer why because they're afraid that they're going to
(3:12:43) offend somebody it's going to hurt their feelings this or that I understand that but at the same time it's like just
(3:12:49) don't lie to me and say uh well I just don't know I never make those judgment calls because yes you do yes you
(3:12:55) definitely make the Judgment calls as to who's prettier than you not prettier than you what if you're just basing it off of what other people tell you not
(3:13:02) that you think you're pretty yeah well I think that most people would would probably base their
(3:13:07) metric on what other people tell them otherwise what would they be comparing it to I don't think I'm you don't so someone doesn't think they're pretty but
(3:13:14) they Bas it off of someone else saying then they're not going to think they're yeah but I think that the the way that
(3:13:20) people inform themselves about beauty standards is based on how people treat them based on their beauty standard
(3:13:25) right yeah I'm not afraid to so if you so if you were like walking around all day long and every guy you ran into was
(3:13:31) like oh you're ugly I'm guessing that you probably wouldn't think you were pretty right but if you walked around
(3:13:36) all day and guys were like oh you're beautiful I'm assuming that you would that would probably higher your
(3:13:41) estimation of yourself maybe that's why too I think I'm really beautiful cuz how many compliments I do get when I step out like
(3:13:47) anywhere men and woman someone on Tik Tok told me they watch my videos with the sound off so I don't know take that
(3:13:54) with what you will I don't know if it was a hate comment or not W that's definitely a hate comment for sure I'm taking it as a positive comment you
(3:14:00) could definitely be like get told you're hotter than you actually are and then rate yourself lower just because you're self let's pull up twitch Damon guys go

(3:21:20) Andrew you [ __ ] scumbag go away Andrew make a silly face you want me to talk [ __ ] to Andrew for a little bit Andrew how you Andrew it's the
(3:21:29) PCP the PCP thought P platelets Andrew like a natural eye filler platelets you
(3:21:36) scoundrel you are a scoundrel Andrew nothing a
(3:21:42) SC Andrew put put your little red screen on shows the red show us you're evil we
(3:21:48) know you're evil put the red thing there on his face you SC I can you see the
(3:21:54) devil horns peeking out what are you eating he's eating a cookie I have some
(3:21:59) wow he's eating a cookie that sounds good my wife's cookies they're not for you not for you hey fair enough wait
(3:22:05) Andrew do you have children you said you brought some girls into this world how many kids do you have I have children I
(3:22:11) have five I have three step kids and then two uh two of my own what are the age ranges like youngest
(3:22:17) oldest uh the oldest are in their 20s and the youngest is um I don't know like
(3:22:22) uh 12 or 13 or 14 or something how old were you when you became a dad I was pretty young how old I was in
(3:22:31) um uh I don't remember my exact age it was like early 20s so D I have a few
(3:22:36) friends who've been married since like early 20s and they're now parents but what do you think was like the biggest thing if anything to change for you as a
(3:22:42) man in the way that you saw women after having your a first child did anything change and if it did what
(3:22:50) um no I so I think that my opinion of women was
(3:22:56) pretty well informed up until that point not maybe not great but it was pretty well informed uh but understanding uh
(3:23:02) women's nature raising women that's a whole different a whole different story
(3:23:08) whole different uh whole different thing it turns out that this idea
(3:23:14) that uh that that women are perfect until a man corrupts their Angelic
(3:23:19) nature is complete and total [ __ ] [ __ ] so that's the thing that I learned more than anything quickly is
(3:23:25) that uh that is not true um at all not even a little bit and there's a lot of
(3:23:31) what uh she called social engineering which tries to reinforce a narrative that women are born Angelic and perfect
(3:23:39) and uh only evil men it's only after evil men corrupt their Angelic nature
(3:23:44) that um that they do in anything which is bad and uh that's that's just not the case no I would agree with you on that I
(3:23:50) think hormones play a huge role into it specifically like if you ever met a 14-year-old girl they could probably use
(3:23:56) an exorcism we've all been 14-year-old girls here yeah I don't think it's hormones I got a different I have a different way that I look at it so well
(3:24:02) I think that there's a superpower that which is corrupting to women especially beautiful women and I think it would be
(3:24:08) just as corrupting to men if they had it so assum just think of it as like um
(3:24:14) you're an X-Men and that your your kind of your mutation your superpower is that
(3:24:20) if you're young and beautiful between the ages of let's say 18 and 27
(3:24:26) basically anything you want from men you can get basically anything you want if you want a door open you're going to get
(3:24:32) it if you need money you're going to get it if you need resources you're going to get that um if you get in trouble they
(3:24:39) likely your punishment's going to be much lighter now it's like a this great superpower but it corrupts too at the
(3:24:45) same time right because it it displaces accountability and since it displaces accountability once that beauty fleets
(3:24:52) women seem to have trouble taking accountability after that they go wait a second it used to be that doors
(3:24:58) magically opened for me gifts just showed up at my house people just gave me resources and attention once that
(3:25:05) Fades though they never learned the accountability portion and so um so I think that that's a that's a massive
(3:25:11) social issue and because matrons in society have been rejected meaning older women who are now always just looking to
(3:25:18) kind of reattach themselves to their youth instead of telling women to have good expectations the matrons of society
(3:25:25) which are designed to guide women through this they're gone they're they're sarily rejected and instead they
(3:25:31) try to hold these ridiculous beauty standards into their 60s and 70s where they look like JLo and this type of thing and it's
(3:25:38) insane so that that's the uh that's the big eye opener yeah I think that I got
(3:25:43) not directly opposed I think it's just different than what I was saying which is like I think women specifically when they're going through puberty for the
(3:25:49) first time just as somebody who was a teenage girl and had other teenage friends that there's some something I
(3:25:55) don't know I think women are not informed enough about hormones we're never really taught about it how it affects you how people after giving
(3:26:01) birth have like postpartum depression and they can literally go psychotic because of it even after abortions too
(3:26:06) people don't talk about this stuff men have men have the same thing like I know this is often not yeah this is often not
(3:26:13) thought about but men when they're going through puberty right write a passage for men they get ultraviolent sometimes
(3:26:20) with each other highly angry very upset very confused right they have a hor a
(3:26:26) hormone uh Siege inside of their bodies as much as women do but their accountability is not taken away so the
(3:26:33) accountability for keeping those things in check that's never displaced from them it does seem like it's more displac
(3:26:40) from women how is that new though since the beginning of time men have been held more accountable than women because
(3:26:47) we've expected men to be the leaders so if you guys want to be the leaders you should expect to be held accountable as well more than counterart how silly this
(3:26:54) is sure you know what I'll concede the argument you're right men should be held more
(3:26:59) accountable the thing is though is if you give them more responsibility right if you give them more responsibility
(3:27:05) then you're going to have to also give them the authority and so you can't say well we're going to take authority away from men which is what egalitarianism
(3:27:12) has done and still give them the same amount of responsibility and have the expectation that you're going to have a
(3:27:17) society which isn't [ __ ] from top to bottom cuz it is the the thing is is like Sure hold men more accountable than
(3:27:23) women but as long as they have the authority right nobody's going to say anything about it but the second you say
(3:27:29) we're equal well then you need to have equal accountability I don't disagree at all I love the patriarchy I think men
(3:27:35) should lead and us women can focus on painting our nails getting making souro
(3:27:40) starters being moms I think the feminist movement is the only reason that women have to work nowadays because of the
(3:27:45) dwelling commment I think no it's not it's not it's not to be pampered no it's the opposite right the the I so this is
() 
(3:27:51) the the faux idea of what P the patriarch is supposed to do which is enable you to be a Pampered princess
(3:27:57) it's not what the patriarch is supposed to do is protect you so that you can fulfill your duties and responsibilities to society and that would including
(3:28:05) reproduction and uh being matrons for the Next Generation I literally a mom and make sourdough starters that goes
(3:28:11) hand in hand with being a traditional housewife being AER princess how is make
(3:28:17) have you ever made sourdough starters if you think making a sour did you say anything about Duty and responsibility you say I think your nails make
(3:28:25) sourdough a mother they should get posted notes be a mother and make sourdough if you've never made sourdough
(3:28:31) then you don't know how hard it is to keep that thing alive and it's part of like making fresh bread for your family making natural ingredients meals that
(3:28:38) don't have toxic chemicals in them I think that all goes hand in hand listen those those are making shower dough
(3:28:45) bread stuff like this the ingredients for it with whatever your modern luxuries are they're just that they're
(3:28:50) luxuries they're gifted they're literally gifted to women by men modern luxuries are definitely women are not
(3:28:57) gifting women Modern Luxury that's insane the thing is is that women have a duty and responsibility ethical Duty and
(3:29:03) responsibility under Christian ethics to uh multiply to have families to
(3:29:08) reproduce to they have a duty under Christian ethics to raise the Next Generation correctly and be matrons to
(3:29:14) young women so that we don't have the problem pornography and things like this that's all gone so as long as that duty
(3:29:20) is displaced from society for women and instead the all that's left is well I love the patriarchy as long as they give
(3:29:26) me a life of luxury we have essentially that's still just as regressive as the idea that um that well egalitarianism is
(3:29:35) bad and I would prefer the patriarchy uh because I get I get a life of luxury it both they're equally bad it's an equally
(3:29:42) bad way to view it I think well I didn't say any of that I think you think I think think that because you think you
(3:29:47) know how women think but it's not oh let's just have the patriarchy and do nothing I'm very traditional Rel yeah
(3:29:53) please I'm very supportive of traditional relationships especially like in Judaism that's a huge thing and
(3:29:59) that's something I've always been raised around and if we're talking about you wanted to bring up Christianity then in Judaism there's a lot where men are the
(3:30:07) leaders but women are actually Holier they have a higher connection to God because of their ability to bring life
(3:30:12) into this world and everything around that so to me if you want to say that like it's just funny that these
(3:30:18) oldfashioned what were Commodities or just basic necessities actually being able to make bread you had to make your
(3:30:24) own bread cleaning your home women used to have to make their own cleaning supplies and be like somewhat chemists so I think now it's seen as a luxury to
(3:30:31) have that time and you know thankfully Society has evolved in that front but like I don't know what impression or
(3:30:36) what made you think that I think that the patriarchy means that we get to sit home all day being a mom you started with because we can paint our nails it's
(3:30:43) called a joke you don't have to be so serious 247 you ever heard of a joke I think you'd like him well sure sure but
(3:30:49) I mean if you ever heard of a criticism right so the thing is is like whether you're saying it whether you're saying it in a joking manner or not right it it
(3:30:56) moves to the point that I'm saying which is that in modernity women seem to have
(3:31:01) a massive sense of entitlement including the ones who say well I'm a traditionalist it's like really are you
(3:31:07) or are you looking for somebody who can provide you for a life of luxury that's the question and usually when you get to the nitty-gritty of it when you look at
(3:31:14) what modern women want they want a life of luxury and a man who can provide it I don't hear them really talk about their
(3:31:19) duties and responsibilities like what is your duty to society do you have one yes
(3:31:26) I've said like no no her yeah I've said maybe 50 times that I think being a mom is the best thing you could do but this
(3:31:31) is why and even though we're both you have a duty to be one I okay even though we're both conservatives like that's my ultimate goal in life I think above any
(3:31:38) career or anything being a mom and having a family I literally this is not something you have to suck out of me I say this on my social media every day
(3:31:44) but this is why I have a problem with despite us both being conservatives this is something that I think for your own
(3:31:50) sake if you really want to have impactful messaging and like continue to have people who maybe disagree I don't disagree with you on most things but
(3:31:56) even you like to actually listen to what you're saying a lot of times when like people on the far right or I don't think
(3:32:03) you're far right but I do think that on our side of the aisle you can very clearly tell that the way you're you're speaking of it from a place where like
(3:32:09) you genuinely have disdain or hard feelings towards women it's not from a place of like I love women they're so
(3:32:15) amazing we need to support them make them mothers we need to let them like we need to protect women at home you're like what's your duty to society that
(3:32:22) doesn't sound like a mature man at all and like why do you think why do you think's job is to kiss your ass my job
(3:32:28) isn't to kiss your ass who said kiss my ass I said to actually want women to be mothers because you want to men I think
(3:32:35) you're disdainful to men I think that you only care about materialism I think that those are the values that you have
(3:32:40) and you haven't said a word about duty but yet at the same time your criticism to me is that if we even have a dispute
(3:32:46) or an argument Suddenly It's disdainful to towards all women no I've raised women into the Next Generation have you
(3:32:52) no I I've actually done it and so the thing is is like before you make these insane criticisms about what the right
(3:32:59) should or shouldn't be right maybe you should learn things like oh I don't know basic libertarian economics and lass a
(3:33:05) fair even though you have a degree in political science which is [ __ ] insane right I think personally that
(3:33:12) what you are as a misandrist and a covert feminist in disguise as a conserv because that's
(3:33:18) what yeah that makes I think you misunderstood what I was saying I wasn't CR one that's barbaric but two like I've
(3:33:24) literally to say that I'm an undercover feminist when I've literally gone head-to-head with feminists for five
(3:33:30) years and all my content and everything I believe ande preach about let me finish how about that okay let me finish
(3:33:36) talking I think you misunderstood what I was saying I wasn't link I was andw can
() 
(3:33:41) you shut up for 30 seconds let me talk the patriarchy AR supposed to be silent can
(3:33:47) somebody mute him Andre just let her finish go ahead Deborah it's that laugh go ahead Deborah
(3:33:52) I think you misunderstood what I was saying as and took it as a personal criticism when I wasn't trying to I
(3:33:59) wasn't saying it as personal criticism I was saying that what you're saying I agree with the majority of what you're
(3:34:04) saying and I think it would come across better and that this is a disconnect between men and women even on the same
(3:34:10) side of the political eye or people who probably share the majority of how they think Society should we run things like
(3:34:15) that I really do think that I think that this is a broken messaging and I would wish that more people would listen to
(3:34:21) this message and I think you don't realize listening to it as somebody who does agree that it doesn't seem like
(3:34:27) it's coming from a place of we should protect women as a society and their
(3:34:32) best thing that they like not their only thing but women are mothers that's their role in society they're the matriarchs
(3:34:38) of society and therefore we should protect them we shouldn't force them to work we shouldn't have to have them working N9 to FES and being corporate
(3:34:44) slaves to their boss who don't care about them and I think the difference is coming from a place of genuinely loving
(3:34:50) women and understanding their importance to the world and to traditional relationships and Traditional Values and
(3:34:56) Christianity and everything alike it seems sometimes that the disconnect in the messaging is that it's just coming
(3:35:01) from a place of like you're a woman you have a duty to do this when rather why do we have that Duty like not why do we
(3:35:07) have that Duty aside from the religion but like where does it actually come from why do you truly believe that women
(3:35:13) should be protected or things like that I just think messaging wise and this wasn't a personal attack I think more people would listen and they should
(3:35:19) listen it just doesn't seem so much like it's coming off right now from a place of like women should be protected in
(3:35:27) sports in the workforce in homes and everything alike and that's all I was saying I wasn't trying to personally
(3:35:33) attack you and if you really think I'm a feminist then that's very hysterical and you have a horrible character judgment
(3:35:39) so can I respond now all that prattle so let me let me just respond and say I I
(3:35:45) think is hilarious that you say oh I heart patriarchy and the second you're in a conversation with a man the first
(3:35:52) thing you do is go how dare you speak over me oh I'm a proud strong woman look
(3:35:57) at how great I am you haven't spoken about duty at all yes absolutely you're a covert feminist the idea here of what
(3:36:04) you're talking about is just peer tone policing it's peer tone policing I I love your messaging Andrew I think
(3:36:09) you're totally right everything you're saying is completely correct but if you used a different tone and kissed women's asses and packaged it and such a way
(3:36:16) that they thought you were kissing their ass they might be more responsive to it that's an opposition to what I want in society what that does is it curtails
(3:36:22) truth what that does is it makes it so that you can't actually deliver a message in its proper context its proper
(3:36:28) form because somebody might take offense that is the opposite of what conservatives should be doing and it is
(3:36:34) the opposite when you see conservatives doing that that you see work case in point Donald J Trump Donald Trump wasn't
(3:36:41) sugarcoating anything he called women ugly dogs he called women fat he called him obnoxious he called him all sorts of
(3:36:48) things and he's the president of the United States right now and women in L actually voted for him this time around
(3:36:54) so the thing is is like all this PC politically correct woke [ __ ] nonsense of Andrew you must correct your
(3:37:00) tone because when I attack you I do it a passive aggressive way and when you talk to me you talk to me directly uh I think
(3:37:07) it's [ __ ] it's nonsense I think you just take everything I say put it through a weird machine and then like
(3:37:12) spew it out and think I said something completely different called I never said oh my God you're talking over me this is
(3:37:19) highlights exactly you're such a strong woman this is what I think I think you just don't like women and that your
(3:37:25) desire for women's to this doesn't come from a place of you genuinely loving and caring about women and thinking that women you can read my heart now the way
(3:37:32) that you're talking to me you think that I had a freak out inside your time you won't let me get five words out it doesn't matter if I'm a woman or you're
(3:37:38) a man it's called a debate and a conversation and if you're not letting the other person get five words out it doesn't matter about our gender it
(3:37:44) matters I I don't know why you think that's crazy for me to ask you to be quiet while I respond to something that you said or let me talk for 10 seconds
(3:37:51) without jumping over me when we can only hear one person at once that's not and of course you attribute that to me being a woman freaking out but really just
(3:37:57) asking you to shut the [ __ ] up for a second I'm going to let right I'm right
(3:38:02) hang on you're going to hit me with I heart patriarchy until the patriarch until the people who you would consider
(3:38:09) Patriarchs are speaking to you and then suddenly the patriarchy should be disrespected you should talk over it you
(3:38:14) should be able to do whatever the hell you want right so the second the second we come into this we find out that no
(3:38:21) your true nature is revealed very quickly it's just another entitled like tpusa girl right spewing a bunch of
(3:38:28) nonsense and trying to pretend that you're a conservative you're laring laring as a conservative covert feminism
(3:38:35) okay griper this is talking first of all why
() 
(3:38:41) are you calling me a graper because this is you're every everything you just said like I I literally it's just so obvious
(3:38:49) like do you want to rewatch what you just said you're telling me because I didn't because I asked you to be quiet
(3:38:55) while I was saying something because you wouldn't let me get a word out that means that I'm a fake feminist and because you're a man that I should shut
(3:39:01) up and just listen to everything you say and say yes sir absolutely I know a ton of leaders who are Patriarchs who are
(3:39:07) much better men than you are and I don't know who you are personally but I'm saying as you're acting now I would never subscribe to you as a leader but
(3:39:13) that doesn't make me a feminist that makes me understanding of how great men can be and I don't think this is a shining example and I don't think
(3:39:19) everything you say is good I think strong men should lead us and if I had to make that choice about you I don't
(3:39:25) think I would be in favor of it but I think strong men protect women and they care about women and good luck to you
(3:39:32) this is actually perfect so the idea here is actually that you're the leader see so the idea here is wait a second
(3:39:38) wait a second I get to determine who leads who I get to determine where they lead him I get to make all those
(3:39:44) determinations after all Andrew if you were some kind of leader I'd never follow you the idea here just moves into
(3:39:50) the regressive notion of feminism it is all the responsibility with none of the authority when Authority is exercised
(3:39:56) the very first thing you do is rebel against it so very first thing you do is rebel against it and so the thing is is
(3:40:02) like we can see this pattern over and over and over again with all of the LARPing conservative Chicks first thing
(3:40:07) you do is call me a gper the hell does graper ideology have to do with Andrew Wilson's ideology nothing complete straw
(3:40:13) man right made up because you were looking for a way to insult me you didn't know what else to say so that's what you said okay graper it's like and
(3:40:20) you're not trying to insult me by calling me an undercover feminist luring I just let you talk I just let
(3:40:26) you talk now I can't now I can't respond so anyway so so moving back into this
(3:40:32) yeah it it just seems like total and complete covert feminism it's exactly what I expect anytime I argue with one
(3:40:38) of the fox conservative babes online it's always the same thing the second you get to the heart of it it's we women
(3:40:44) should be protected women should be should have their asses kick kissed right but men should have the
(3:40:50) responsibility with none of the authority so like here let me give you a demonstration of this if I'm wrong do you think women should vote Yes should
(3:40:58) they be able to vote to send men to war you mean voting on a draft no just
(3:41:03) voting period if you vote I think women should be able to vote Yes yeah so send men and and uh are you eligible to be
(3:41:12) drafted I never registered for the draft but that is I know that's I know cu the ra never
(3:41:19) passed and that's a position I've held that as an American citizen who has a right to vote I think that women even
(3:41:25) though as a society I don't think it would be helpful to send women to War I understand my duty as an American that
(3:41:30) if America was in a war tomorrow and they said you're an American we need you to fight this is my country I want to defend it but you say that I'm attacking
(3:41:37) you but you called me a fake conservative you said I'm a undercover lar feminist what makes you think of I'm fake conservative what does that even
(3:41:43) mean I have ideologies how can be a fake conservative when I've lived My Life by the ideolog out to you right now right
(3:41:50) now that that if you say if you say for instance that there should be egalitarianism women should vote equal
(3:41:55) to men's vote but women cannot be drafted and thus can vote to send men off to war you're actually giving
(3:42:02) yourself a position of privilege in society that men do not have since this is the case that you that you accept
(3:42:08) that there's privilege that that uh women have that men on the other hand do
(3:42:13) not have you say for instance wait a second I think it's my duty to get drafted they're not going to send you to
(3:42:19) the front lines to fight it's ridiculous they never would our army would get crushed so that that doesn't even make
(3:42:24) any sense that's not hang on hang on I'm almost done I just let you talk that's not a that first of all it's not a
(3:42:31) conservative principle it makes no sense at all right and again this is the idea
(3:42:36) of men responsibility absent Authority absent Authority it's still taking away
(3:42:42) Authority if you really wanted men to be in Authority why would you add women votee that makes no sense because I love
(3:42:49) voting and I think women should vote because you love voting because I'm an active member of society
(3:42:57) okay because I want to Andrew cuz I want to well this is what I mean when you take what I say and you put it this is
(3:43:04) why I called you a grer too you don't think women should vote you take what I say and you put it through a ringer when I it's not conservative to say that I
(3:43:11) would defend my country if we went to war because I agree with the values of American value and I think that's worth
(3:43:16) defending if it were to come to war but at the same time I don't think women it's a mark of a good Society where
(3:43:22) women and children are protected and they're not sent to the front lines like they're doing in Ukraine right now there have been a lot of women who' have been
(3:43:27) drafted there are situations like that that makes me a fake conservative I don't think there's been
(3:43:33) not drafting they were as they were trying to recruit women because they've been running so low on soldiers can you
(3:43:38) mute okay I okay so tell me I just want to answer to my question if what's your
(3:43:43) question when you take everything want to have authority and women to to
(3:43:49) be the followers and Men the leaders Men actually have the authority why do you advocate for women to vote can you
(3:43:55) actually tell me is that is women not voting going to suddenly make is that going to take away every single woman
(3:44:00) from a powerful position in this entire country because we're talking reality we're not talking in floofy land where
(3:44:06) anything can happen right now why do you so why do you think women should not have the right to vote why do you think
(3:44:11) I just I just told you I just told you so if you add vate that men have the
(3:44:17) responsibility right but they don't have the authority which I think you're advocating for it's a progressive
(3:44:22) feminist Viewpoint if it were true that you wanted men to have the authority right and the responsibility then you
(3:44:29) would Advocate only they voted and not women can you actually give me an argument any argument at all for how
(3:44:36) that doesn't logically follow it doesn't line up with the original land owning
(3:44:41) and everything that was said in our Constitution to provide voting rights the fact that women can own their own land right now what women couldn't vote
(3:44:48) women couldn't vote I know and when we changed and gave women the right to vote I think that was a good thing I think it got more women involved and I think this
(3:44:54) ideology of yours and again why I called you a gper is because the majority of reason why far-right men do not want
(3:44:59) women to vote is because women tend to vote liberal I voted conservative across the board I voted Republican in every
(3:45:05) election but I'm not going to defend my values that I know near and dear to my heart and the candidates that I've
(3:45:11) worked for including Rob asterino I was on Trump's team on his Coalition of Jewish voices across the board I have
(3:45:17) helped Republican candidates get elected so I don't really care what you have to say whether you think I'm fake or not
(3:45:23) that's not an argument can can I actually get an actual argument from you here's the argument my AR that's my response to you you actually want men to
(3:45:30) have authority so then we just move Authority that's what he is and responsibility and women to follow that
(3:45:37) Authority and not have responsibility why would you Advocate women voted that
(3:45:43) makes no sense can you give me an actual argument the strongest response for this time is that the men right now you know
(3:45:49) the old saying where Good Times create strong men strong or whatever it is good
(3:45:54) times basically create weak men and I think we're in that time zone right now where if we were in the George
(3:45:59) Washington are you going to let me finish go ahead go ahead if we were at a time where masculinity was very
(3:46:06) prevalent I think we this is a large issue where you have a sassy man apocalypse we don't have men understanding what it means actually be
(3:46:12) men I think that if we were in a time zone where men were strong true leaders
(3:46:17) then we can go to that but when we have men out here who are soy boys they don't
(3:46:22) want to speak up they support abortion they think that they should just listen to whatever their wife should do they don't actually think that a woman has a
(3:46:29) value they think that the woman they should be a stay-at-home dad a lot of things like that I think at this point in society that if we just handed it
(3:46:35) over to the men the men are having a lot of problems too we can talk about lowering testosterone levels and everything across hiring levels of
(3:46:41) anxiety and depression across the board and I think it doesn't make me fake conservative to say that I think there
(3:46:46) are good men male leaders out there much better than you could ever be and if you think you're compared to Donald Trump advocated that women need to lead
(3:46:54) advocated that women need to lead and usurp men's Authority that was literally what you just advocated I can't believe
(3:47:00) you said that I literally can't even believe Deborah Deborah I'll let you
(3:47:05) respond there's been a we have a we'll get I'll let you guys get right back to it I promise I need to let a couple
(3:47:13) chats we'll get right n Nao donated $200 when Andrew asked the women to
(3:47:19) raise their hands if they think they're the prettiest you mumbled under your breath after making a face like you
(3:47:25) might raise your hand I am not going to half I believe that he's talking to me
(3:47:31) but what I said is that there's another one coming through because oh I said that I'm not going to do that because I was raised with manners and I just think
(3:47:37) that it's not respectful to other people to boast about looks or try to say that you're better than anybody in a group
(3:47:42) even if that's a social experiment I just $200 we can see your inflated ego of
(3:47:49) self you lead with nails and coloring because you are a Pampered princess you
(3:47:54) enjoy standing on your soap box and casting stones but you're the exact what you criticize there's one more coming
() 
(3:48:01) after this but uh your quick response to that if you want I lived in the Middle East I survived rocket attacks I've
(3:48:07) survived drone attacks I have volunteered with widows and Warriors and people who are amputees and victims of
(3:48:13) war across the world I I don't know that's my response kiss my ass all right uh we winged winged Jager
(3:48:21) 93 donated $200 being a longtime silent Watcher of
(3:48:26) your content Brian keep up the great work Andrew spit that fire yeah I would
(3:48:34) like I would like just real quick and I'll I'll move it right back to you but just so you know what you just said literally was that the reason that women
(3:48:41) need to vote is because we need to usurp Authority from the men in society right now because they're too weak to have it
(3:48:47) that was your actual argument that that I I can't actually believe it but you actually made that
(3:48:53) argument I wasn't listening to the first half I was making sure I wasn't being I'll go ahead and reiterate well okay
(3:48:58) hold on no no no stop stop stop we can debate ongan this is a dating podcast okay first off sounds like you're it
(3:49:05) sounds like you're scared I kind of let sounds like you are hold on now I need to address this [ __ ] here This
(3:49:11) Woman's trying to accuse me of like I let it slide the first two times you were not [ __ ]
(3:49:17) like Chase mistakenly put a a Zen in your drink I I object to you trying to
(3:49:24) frame that even if it a joke that he was like trying to drug your drink now
(3:49:30) you're actually trying to there's like a little bit have you ever had water that
(3:49:35) have you ever had [ __ ] water that has some bubbles in it it's not bubbles it was just something on the top you see
(3:49:41) after I poured water into her drink I poured some of let me a absolutely ridiculous you would
(3:49:48) never drug anybody on the show I when I say Zen I'm don't that's not like a way
(3:49:53) to drug people it was literally just somebody AC I had a bottle of water next to me I poured some into yours then I
(3:49:59) poured some into mine there backed maybe you [ __ ] backwashed I had drinken from it yet so that's why I was just it
(3:50:06) could have been sh in my cup it doesn't I don't so upset Brian because you stopped the oh what's what's this and
(3:50:13) then you're saying but well before we you let me make sure that drug my [ __ ] drink I didn't say
(3:50:19) drug it I said I was looking what was in it because he was saying something and I couldn't yes but I need to clear up the air that you're your the implication
(3:50:26) here is that I don't think Zin is drugging somebody and I it's not a z there was no Zen there implication that
(3:50:31) you put it in there it could have already been my cup there was just something floating at the top and you were sitting next to me so I said what
(3:50:36) do you think that is pour it in there I was just what is that here for the girls who saw me pour the water did you also
(3:50:43) after I poured the water no one thinks you poured anything in my cup Brian that there was something floating it could
(3:50:48) have fallen from the I could have turned to her too far back it was literally just asking a hair could have been
(3:50:54) floating in there I would say what do you think that is I don't think you poured it in there just the way you were framing it seemed little [ __ ] I don't
(3:51:02) think that would well I'm sorry that if you felt that I don't think you would ever do that it was just weird don't you love apologies like that like I'm sorry
(3:51:08) you feel that way because I didn't mean it like that at all and I'm sorry if it offended you and that you thought that I framed you in that light cuz I would I
(3:51:14) don't think ever get ruined over even the the hint of an accusation like that
(3:51:20) so like I know for women you guys can just kind of like you live in LA law land because you have no fear of being
(3:51:26) falsely accused of [ __ ] anything but men's whole careers can be [ __ ]
(3:51:31) ruined by even the hint of a [ __ ] accusation so like yeah it's no big deal for you but for us men we take that [ __ ]
(3:51:38) really seriously I can understand in any case I didn't mean to interrupt that but if you guys want to continue I just want to we can
(3:51:45) that out that I understand that I think that's horrible for the record nobody has ever drugged me or would ever triy
(3:51:51) to drug me on this somebody accidentally Spit In My Cup last time and I just was asking not because I thought you poured
(3:51:56) anything it I just saw something floating in my cup that looked like dirt or whatever it might be and I didn't want to chug it if it was something go
(3:52:02) get your own water next time like I trying to do you a favor I was pouring your own [ __ ] water just go get your had nothing to do with you pouring the
(3:52:08) water this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life I understand that men can be extra
(3:52:14) cautious about it and I won't make any more jokes about it but it wasn't even a joke I genuinely saw something floating
(3:52:20) in it and it had nothing to do with zins I just wanted to know and he was talking so I made a joke I don't know everybody's so [ __ ] sensitive on this
(3:52:26) show but next topic next topic I'm not I'm not sensitive I I I just very I'm
(3:52:32) almost almost I I I mean I I would I would just like a very quick answer to this I'm going to get a fresh glass of
(3:52:39) water before it cuz I don't want anybody to be upset about anything so there's a glass of water apparently this is a bad
(3:52:46) water so I'm just how it I'll take your how is it a bad water bad energy I asked
(3:52:53) what was floating in it wow now she just this is ridiculous now she's just gone and tossed the water I'm cleaning out
(3:52:59) the cup cuz there was something weird in it there was nothing in [ __ ] in your cup all the time there's nothing in your cup
(3:53:05) there's nothing in your cup can we by the way I trust you but let me just dump the water oh my God absurd never had
(3:53:12) this happen on the show let's do something else okay well you need to be very clear and like walk back and
(3:53:19) like just make an affirmative statement on this I'm not going to allow myself to be
(3:53:28) falsely accused can I come to the nextcast this is not it there was bubbles of some sort not in
(3:53:35) concerned of a drug way I saw a little fuzz piece floating in my cup and I turn
(3:53:40) to anyone normal and would go what is that it could have been from before beforehand I just had curiosity and I
(3:53:47) did not mean to implicate that it had anything to do with you pouring me the water or any of your actions I was just
(3:53:53) asking anybody like I would to hear what their humble opinion what that was and that's all and it's gone and I got a
(3:53:59) fresh water not because I was concerned but because maybe there was dirt in my cup from when I first got the cup and I
(3:54:04) just wanted a clean cup now so there is that no one's drugging me nobody's doing
(3:54:09) anything little it's cleared up it's it's cleared up I'm sorry not that if
(3:54:14) you felt that way but I'm sorry I still the so if I framed you in that light because that was not my intention is
(3:54:21) that okay next topic yeah no we're we're good all cleared up I
(3:54:27) would actually like an answer to this just just very brief Ang numbers wait she said I want to make sure I'm not
(3:54:32) getting zined again okay I'll be charitable you were making a joke um all right go ahead Andrew I I just i' just
(3:54:38) like to finish this just because I I do want to know uh the I I want you to
(3:54:43) realize at the argument that you just made to me and this is why this is why I think that so many women who are in the
(3:54:49) position you are covert feminist because the argument you made to me is that we can't turn the responsibility over to men for voting because they're too weak
(3:54:57) this in turn is actually saying that women need to have authority that's what your actual argument reduces to do you
(3:55:03) understand that no matter what I say you're just going to tell me what you think I am and what you think I know so I think that at this point it'd be best
(3:55:10) if we just moved along because you're clearly not no my response is that whatever I say I could say the sky is
(3:55:15) blue you're like and she thinks the sky is freaking pink so I think it's better to just move on and involve the other
(3:55:21) guests who have been traveled here from far away to be a part of this conversation that was my response you
(3:55:26) can take it or you can cry about it I think that everybody else is here to be a part of a dating conversation and
(3:55:32) there are a lot of topics and situations that people came here to talk about we're already 4 hours into this podcast
(3:55:38) I think we've taken enough time from everybody else and we can do our own situation about this and it is to just
(3:55:45) answer the question that's my response if you don't like it that's on you so so you can't answer to the qu of why you
(3:55:51) just said that women need to have authority no like I I don't one at a later date or so like
(3:56:00) square up yeah if we want to have a One V one that's a we can discuss that okay okay here's the thing if that's the case
(3:56:08) us hang on that's fair that's fair but can he actually commit right this that
(3:56:14) you'll actually do the debate because here's what I think will happen I think that you'll say sure I'll do a debate
(3:56:20) and then the second you're off the show you'll back out in 15 seconds so can you make a firm commitment here on the
(3:56:25) whatever podcast you'll actually do a debate with me 1 V one I can make a firm commitment to you that I that I am open
() 
(3:56:32) to doing a debate to you we have to see what the logistics are but I would be
(3:56:38) open to debating you maybe I don't know I'm not on whatever podcast I leave La yeah I'll go Moran debate you there too
(3:56:44) it doesn't matter where we can I I'll host I just don't live in California so
(3:56:51) I don't know where I live in Michigan but I would fly out specifically to do a One V one the thing is is like I just
(3:56:56) want a commitment an actual commitment you'll actually do we can we can arrange for
(3:57:02) that The Crucible wants to see it so all right
(3:57:10) um good talk good that was really good all right
(3:57:15) date do you want to do a date or like maybe Jan January or something or oh like you want to do January or um
(3:57:22) February probably closer to February because I have the inauguration and I have a ton of weddings in December and
(3:57:30) yeah closer to febs febs all right that was really cool we have a chat here from
(3:57:35) Lucas uh 100 stop tone policing your message packaging sucks and has no res
(3:57:42) your message no resonance with any patriarchal man I have no interest whatsoever in any form of whitewashed
(3:57:48) hyp sanitized squishy gynocentric Messin Messin Messin thank you Lucas I
(3:57:56) do appreciate do you want to respond to Lucas or okay Lucas sounds good all
(3:58:03) right and this is below the threshold thank you for that for that man okay all right uh we're going to get into the
(3:58:08) questionnaire finally finally get into the questionnaire here starting with cie
(3:58:13) cie you uh disagree so you said it's not
(3:58:19) fine or you disagree that it's fine to ask a woman her body count on the first date why is
(3:58:24) that I just think it's a weird question mhm um I just I don't think it's it's
(3:58:30) relevant mhm um I couldn't tell you my body count cuz I don't care that much
(3:58:36) like to ever have counted it in my head and held that as something that's
() 
(3:58:42) important to me so mhm and uh who else I think a few other
(3:58:47) people circled that that it's uh you disagree that it's fine to ask a woman her body count on a first date who else
(3:58:54) I disagree that's um very inappropriate to ask and it's none of the men's business of what the woman does you also
(3:59:01) disagreed does with her body you know Tanya you also disagreed who's yes baby
(3:59:08) girl yeah into to the mic if you can that Ain none of your business and then Deborah you also disagree I didn't agree
(3:59:14) I have circled that because I think it was a little bit more nuanced I think it's valid for people who have a hard
(3:59:20) cut off like I personally have ask people that question on a second date a man because like I would never even ma
(3:59:28) not even marry I would never even go on a third date with somebody who had sex with more than like 50 women 100 women
(3:59:33) things like that so I totally respect it on that front but I think the first date aspect to it is just a little strange
(3:59:39) because you don't really I mean maybe for you you know after a first date but I think usually after a first date you
(3:59:45) know if you like the person but to know if that's somebody that you really want to commit to and get to know and I think first date should be fun and light and
(3:59:52) like two hours and then the second date a little bit more serious so I just thought it was a little weird on the first date but I think it's a valid
(3:59:57) question and like I never asked my boyfriend my ex-boyfriend with his body can we've been to together for six years because it doesn't matter what he did
(4:00:03) before me you know and and going to you uh so Emily you also disagreed uh why do
(4:00:10) you disagree with that cuz same like if it happen before you I don't think it's
(4:00:15) necessarily your business as long as you're being like safe with it you know if they were asking for the concern of
(4:00:21) like STDs that's why they want to know how many people you slept with you know I what if it wasn't about STDs then why
(4:00:27) is it your business you weren't part of the picture anything from here on out with you in the picture involves you but
(4:00:35) before you past doesn't matter yeah who who agrees with that past does not matter no agree agree so you got would
(4:00:42) you guys date um I mean it depends what kind of past you have like you know you're like a porn
(4:00:48) star then no I'm not but I was like not going to date you wait what but hold on why the man's a porn like if he was PR
(4:00:54) porn yeah what's wrong with that then well because that he's been with a lot of wom I wouldn't feel safe so his body
(4:01:00) count well I just wouldn't wouldn't feel safe with the guy who had a lot of like yeah but it's it's none of his business
(4:01:06) right or sorry none of your business right just because you're in porn doesn't mean you have a high body count there's people us isn't that what porn
(4:01:12) is does I know people that have higher body counts than mean they've never been in
(4:01:18) porn but that doesn't mean that porn porn stars don't gen sex with multiple
(4:01:23) let me make this really simple do you think comparing the average male porn
(4:01:28) star to the average male who's going to have a higher body count typically a
(4:01:34) porn star but sometimes they're not it's not always right but that's the exception yeah yeah yeah okay yeah uh so
(4:01:40) okay um so past doesn't matter so let's say
(4:01:46) uh would you want to know if a pre a current partner ever cheated on somebody
(4:01:52) oh yeah obviously so their past does matter all of a sudden in a little bit oh I got a really good question on
(4:01:58) this who just curious who said past doesn't matter it was you none of their business no body count is not their
(4:02:04) business but I definely think like past exes past relationship behaviors like that yeah I got a perfect question for
(4:02:11) you uh so it was it just you two who have this position past shouldn't matter doesn't matter um
(4:02:17) would you date a guy who's had homosexual sex no why not because I would be kind of fruity right but okay
(4:02:24) and then would you date a man who's had sex with I want a straight man sorry yeah my preference is just a straight man no he's straight but he's had sex
(4:02:30) with a man before that means he's not straight okay fine I'll I'll leave him Grant he's bisexual no no my preference
(4:02:35) is not a bisexual man yeah but he he's met you he's no longer dating men
(4:02:41) anymore and he hasn't dat long as he's not going to go have sex with any other men no but he's been personal preference
(4:02:48) I would not it still wouldn't bother you and he changed his mind yeah he Chang people are like Curious so like a year
(4:02:55) before he dated you he was getting plowed in the ass by another Manu no okay at least you're honest yeah my
(4:03:01) preference would be no no but he he's done totally done with men still
(4:03:09) now yeah I just kind of maybe like wish he hadn't told me that cuz it's like
(4:03:14) it's none of my business so he told you it it's the truth of what happened would
(4:03:19) it be an issue um moving forward he's completely done with it then no would it
(4:03:25) give you the ick yeah so would you even gu like that I
(4:03:31) mean it's like is he thinking about me having sex with guys in the past that would give him the ick too just like don't think about that it has nothing to
(4:03:37) do no but I don't care about him I'm talking about you yeah I wouldn't think about it either as long as it's never going to happen again then I guess
(4:03:43) experiment once he decided he didn't like it okay so the way that y'all feel
(4:03:49) about you being with a man who [ __ ] another man that's how we feel about you
(4:03:55) guys [ __ ] other guys [ __ ] other men all right what if someone lies about being closeted like they say they're
(4:04:02) completely straight but doesn't that make you if you like sorry repeat the
(4:04:08) question again I'll try to engage you on like for example I dated someone for like 6 months and they told me they were
(4:04:16) actually like I caught them in the act of sucking dick oh now like what do I
(4:04:21) think like I'm traumatized because I thought this guy was straight is that count as is that count
(4:04:28) as he slept with other men in the past or like and I'm at fault for that or is that his fault for not being honest I
(4:04:33) don't know um I just want a real man that doesn't do that stuff is that so hard to find
(4:04:39) nowadays but okay sounds like I need to go to therapy after this me too
(4:04:44) Emily and Deborah you guys said you disagree that men are the qu the thing
(4:04:50) is men are not insecure for caring about the woman's body count you both disagreed why is that I circled it you
(4:04:55) did Circle it Deborah I disagree meaning I do think he's insecure for caring about body count yeah I think I C it
(4:05:01) that too huh I disagree meaning I do think it's insecure to care about body
(4:05:07) count do you know what disagree means what was the statement men are not
(4:05:12) insecure for in about a woman's body count disagreeing means men are insecure
(4:05:18) yeah and I disagreed with that statement meaning men are insecure for worrying about body count right yes that's that's saying men
(4:05:26) aren't men are not me why do you think that do you know the def definition men
(4:05:32) yeah she thinks men are insecure for it yeah I disagree with the statement meaning yes men are insecure for thinking that for being concerned about
(4:05:38) that okay right yes okay okay I guess I also
(4:05:47) circled it but not for the same reason I don't think insecure is the right word for it necessarily I I don't think it
(4:05:54) makes them insecure I just think I don't know why I disagree with that saying I
(4:05:59) just feel like insecure is a weird word to use to describe that I think both People Partners in a relationship should
(4:06:05) have some level of concern at all or they don't that's fine and then they would be a good match for each other but
(4:06:11) I think it's very normal and healthy to have some concern about that for bonding you know because it makes it
(4:06:18) harder to bond with people but insecure is just not I wouldn't call a man insecure for being concerned uh and why
(4:06:24) are men insecure if they care about the woman's body count because like I said why is that any of your business like
() 
(4:06:30) you weren't part of the picture maybe if you came into my life sooner I'm at the love of my life I wouldn't have gone around sleeping with this guy that guy
(4:06:36) so would you say that you don't think it's fair like would it not be fair for a guy you tell him your body count and
(4:06:43) he because of your body count he doesn't want to date you would that be unfair I think that would be insecure
(4:06:50) insecure so I don't think it's unfair cuz people have their preferences okay but he would he would
(4:06:56) be insecure um yeah because why does me being with other men before you're even there like bother you so much are you
(4:07:02) trying to that's wouldn't it be a mark of security so the idea is that a person has uh boundaries and preferences and
(4:07:11) they're willing to enforce those preferences it seems like it's the most secure thing you can do but you can't like base someone's behavior from when
(4:07:18) they're a single like let that affect how they would act when you're in a relationship because that's when I'm
(4:07:23) single I wouldn't go sleep around with people when I'm in a relationship well I mean actually the best predictor for
(4:07:29) future behavior is past Behavior so I mean being single you can say my past behavior in relationship who's the
(4:07:35) psychology degree person me yeah this is actually like a like a psychological
(4:07:40) princi you can't compare someone being single to them being Rel they act people
(4:07:46) I I mean I agree with this point I don't think you're making a bad point that uh people can reform and all different
(4:07:52) sorts of things I'm not even I'm not even disagreeing with that I'm only disagreeing about one point which is the idea of insecurity if you have
(4:07:59) boundaries on what your preferences are and you're not willing to compromise on those boundaries doesn't that show
(4:08:05) security not insecurity I feel like you should be secure with your partner knowing that
(4:08:10) they're with you in the present moment and moving forward they wouldn't repeat the past that doesn't answer my question
(4:08:15) but I feel like it's double stand let me repeat the let me repeat the question so I make sure that you understand the question if you have boundaries and you
(4:08:23) enforce those boundaries right how is that not a sign of
(4:08:29) security it is insecure to be concerned over something superficial that didn't
(4:08:35) involve you and would not be repeated with this new bond that you're involved
(4:08:41) in why would you let external factors affect something like a whole different
(4:08:46) situation I think it's insecure to worry about it's kind of like don't worry about things that are out of your control type of thing like it's kind of
(4:08:53) insecure to be thinking about what they're doing when you were picture it in isn't it insecure to try to make a
(4:09:00) person compromise on their boundaries for your benefit no because then that's just preference if they don't need to be
(4:09:05) with me I said I would respect if a man didn't want to be with me because of my body count but but what would make that in yeah but the the point here is
(4:09:12) because why are you so worried about what did before you like why does that affect you because you're enforcing your
(4:09:17) preference you're enforcing your preference and your boundaries and so if you enforce your preference and boundaries that seems like it's a sign
(4:09:22) of a secure person an insecure person would be somebody who would compromise on their own boundaries right but an
(4:09:29) insecure person is someone who's even concerned about that it's like calling a woman insecure for saying like oh why
(4:09:34) are you liking her photos on Instagram but me being secure is me respecting my relationship boundaries like you
(4:09:39) shouldn't be liking all these women's pictures okay well let's but they're going to call me inure for getting upset
(4:09:44) over them is it insecure to not like let's say that you really loved the CH he thought she was great and then he
(4:09:50) found out she had genital herpes and so you said okay I'm going to end this relationship because I don't want to be with somebody who has genital herpes is
(4:09:56) that insecurity no no that's that's bring heal concern but it happened before it happened before right had
(4:10:03) nothing had nothing that is something that affects your present partner that is a health concern but all the other
(4:10:09) hookups before if you never caught anything none of that affects your current part and you did it safely then
(4:10:14) it shouldn't really matter yeah sure it's it's a health it's a health concern right but it still conflates to preference so some people's preferences
(4:10:21) this health concern wouldn't bother them for other people the health concern would bother them they're just enforcing
(4:10:26) their preference right they're say my preference to not have my boyfriend following girls but some people are
(4:10:31) going to say that's insecure for not letting him interact with girl yeah I understand that some people would say that I'm not I'm not saying that it's an
(4:10:38) insecurity that you have boundaries and because you have boundaries you're willing to enforce them that's not in
(4:10:43) secure that seems like it's a sign of being secure insecure seems to me like a
(4:10:48) person who's willing to Wayne on their boundaries or in some way throw them out the window that seems like a sign of
(4:10:54) insecurity I think insecurity is more not feeling secure enough in your relationship to not be worried about
(4:11:00) those external factors if you were secure enough you wouldn't be worried about who your partner was with before
(4:11:06) you or who your partner is interacting with online if you secure enough with all that I think it is insecure to be
(4:11:13) worried about those superficial things that do not concern you pres my dad jump in really quick uh do you think a man
(4:11:19) would be insecure if he didn't want to date a woman because she had a body count of a 100
(4:11:27) no wait can you repeat that but what does that have to do with him this is totally this is totally Central to the
(4:11:34) conversation oh no no no oh wait you were answering it what does that have to do with him yeah so okay just so we're
(4:11:40) clear there there would be no C and I I'll even grant you that there's no STDs involved somehow she's she's [ __ ]
(4:11:48) played Russian roulette with her [ __ ] still didn't get an STD a thousand men she's been with a
(4:11:55) thousand men before him still insecure as long as she's not still
(4:12:01) talking to those men or those nothing's going to happen relationship damn she she's been with 10,000 men before him
(4:12:10) still insecure what is there to complain about though like is her coochie loose is she
(4:12:16) concerned is it affecting your health like exactly what what is the problem that's just a matter of tell I'll tell
(4:12:22) you I'll possession and trying to objectify someone and be like Oh through your fuing experienced by
(4:12:29) other people you you you're like stalking who he's following your Poss that's present that's present moment but
(4:12:35) what happened before doesn't matter I bet you still get Jealous of the chicks he used to [ __ ] me personally yes I'm
(4:12:42) insecure I can admit that but I would admit that it's insecure for a Man Too what yeah but why why would it be
(4:12:50) insecure if like uh you do realize that men have a Revolt factor in them right
(4:12:55) and for good reason they have a Revolt factor for good reason the idea being that uh the less the less men that a
() 
(4:13:02) woman has been with the more likely that you can secure paternity right so this is the idea the idea is that uh until
(4:13:10) modern times in paternity test the only way you could determine if a child was yours as if a woman exclusively was
(4:13:16) having sex with you right there's there was no other way to determine that so it's it's wired into men to have a
(4:13:23) Revolt factor to a woman's promiscuous Behavior right it's so it's actually wired in so if that's the case right
(4:13:30) then the premise here is hey they find it revolting why why would it be a sign of insecurity to to you know for some
(4:13:38) reason do the thing you thought was revolting that's just seems the opposite to me but isn't it also like
(4:13:44) biologically ingrained in women to like find a provider and such like that yes I
(4:13:52) think so so so you would think that they would tailor if they wanted a provider
(4:13:58) and they knew that men generally tend to find higher body counts to be revolting if women were moving towards that you
(4:14:05) would think that they would keep their body counts low on purpose right like that makes sense doesn't it yeah yeah
(4:14:12) but not Not all men care about that type of stuff and so I that's true not all do not all do but but but the type of men
(4:14:20) that you would probably want probably care about that kind of stuff right exactly yeah but then there's the type
(4:14:25) of men who care about what the wom's body count is but totally dismisses what his own body counts and that's what
(4:14:30) double because women tend to not care about that at all in fact it's the opposite it's very bizarre um and this
(4:14:37) this has always been a strange phenomenon to me but I've actually seen men who are virgins in their 30s get
(4:14:43) shamed by women and told well wait there must be actually something wrong with you if other women don't desire you
(4:14:49) they're like there must be something wrong with you I've actually seen that uh but I don't really see that phenomenon in Reverse which is
(4:14:59) strange like men definitely desire women who have no body count like they definitely desire that but on the side
(4:15:06) don't seem to give a [ __ ] too much about a man's body count I don't know some men like their women a little seasoned Maybe
(4:15:13) a little more experien but most of men just want a virgin so you guys just go 15year old then hasn't done like what I
(4:15:21) don't understand why they why they so is it not weird for a 40-year-old to be a virgin cuz my brother's a 40-year-old
(4:15:27) and he's a virgin so yeah I think I think a lot of women would see that as talking about body count and I have a
(4:15:32) brother who's a virgin he's 40 what about him I find that kind of weird okay yeah exactly that makes well that makes
(4:15:38) sense right I think that most women would say that's weird that's weird that's odd that's strange that he's 40
(4:15:44) and a virgin right that this actually is making my point for me and so what does she do immediately she's like oh well if
(4:15:50) you want a virgin go fight a 15y what does you what do the big 15 have to do with their virginity like all of this
(4:15:56) all that is just straight up shaming tactic it's it's all shaming tactic to just tell a man it's inappropriate for
(4:16:04) you to not want a woman with a high body count that's just insane and actually it's interesting like the 40-year-old
(4:16:10) male virgin is like a lot of women women as like the women that would date them
(4:16:15) in terms of like you know respective age or whatever the women in that age range
(4:16:22) that's going to probably be a big red flag for vast majority of women but like somehow there's a 40-Year-Old Virgin
(4:16:28) woman I would argue that she's going to be pretty highly coveted by a lot of men
(4:16:34) in her own age range they're going to be like whoa that's rare mhm like a unicorn
(4:16:39) where dude's going to be looked at as a weirdo right yeah dude yeah dude's going to be like that's
(4:16:44) super weird uh so like depends on the reason too like I would be like why are you a
(4:16:50) virgin at 40 cuz he lives with his mom and plays video games Works a job but
(4:16:55) weird go out and that dating life or something do something you get in bed so I personally don't find it like any
(4:17:01) problem with the Virgin man at all in my like0 40 is I would ask like I said I would bad as sex yeah right but but
(4:17:09) that's the whole key right the whole key there is like you would ask think it's weird right you would ask because you
(4:17:15) think it's weird I mean unusual for sure because he could just be like really religious and he
(4:17:21) just hasn't found the girl I don't know that's cute I love that yeah that's also
(4:17:26) the fact that you think it's weird is the point that I'm trying to make right the fact that you even think it's odd to begin with is is showing this kind of
(4:17:33) Distinction uh which we're looking at which is that definitely um men are seem
() 
(4:17:40) seem to be very happy with women with low body counts and seem to prefer it if they can get one uh whereas whereas
(4:17:46) women don't seem to care nearly as much about men having a higher body count and I you know this could have something to
(4:17:51) do with the penetrative nature of it I'm not exactly sure why but that does seem to be the case I mean I disagree I
(4:17:58) personally do care like about my man's body count I feel like it's super important for me to know especially
(4:18:04) because sex is such a like a spiritual thing that in my eyes I feel like you should only share with one person even
(4:18:10) though I know you guys probably disagree with that but that's just the reason why I would like probably care I would care
(4:18:15) well I I agree with you that there's many individual women many individual women that would care about this and
(4:18:21) there's just like uh but but if we're talking about the wide scope of women uh
(4:18:27) generally speaking they don't seem to care as much about it as men care about it I guess that's the the point that I'm
(4:18:33) after not that individual women don't care about it because I know tons that do M uh quick question for you uh you
(4:18:41) said that I don't know if you said some men or a lot of men they prefer their women more seasoned so like more
(4:18:47) sexually experienced yeah some of them do yeah I mean so they like today strippers only fans girls yeah those
(4:18:52) guys are degenerates but um so I guess my question to you is do you
(4:18:59) think like realistically speaking do you think when it comes to the sexual experience component uh well I suppose
(4:19:06) men would like you know woman who is quote unquote good and bad although uh
(4:19:12) if if you're a man and you know how to you have some degree of sexual experience you can have a pretty stellar
(4:19:18) sexual experience with an inexperienced woman or even a virgin um do you think
(4:19:23) most men like if the tradeoff is she's a bit she's marginally better
(4:19:29) in the bedroom or even much better in the bedroom but this this entails that
(4:19:35) she's [ __ ] 20 additional men before me do you think most men make that
(4:19:41) tradeoff I don't think they think about that like oh she's better in bed oh
(4:19:46) she's probably [ __ ] more people like it could be she's been longterm
(4:19:51) relationship oh but yeah but you got to like yes I agree with in fact I may argue this point all the time a woman
(4:19:59) who has a low body count who's been in you've what two relationships right two long-term relationships she's probably
(4:20:05) better in bed than the woman who's had a 100 one night stands with a 100 different men and only [ __ ] one men
(4:20:11) one time I can agree with that cuz relationship so this idea that the higher the body count she's going to be better in bed I doesn't really compute
(4:20:18) necessarily because she could have had just a bunch of one night stands I said there's some correlation but your whole
(4:20:24) statement I don't know why you bring that up because your whole statement here is we're talking about women with higher body counts and your position is
(4:20:33) your argument for like oh men would prefer women with a higher body count is
(4:20:38) because she's more seasoned in other other words more sexual
(4:20:45) experience it's like kind of frustrating like I don't know I'm not saying it's causation necessarily sleeping with more
(4:20:52) people makes you better in bed but I'm saying that it gives you more experiences like maybe that person's
(4:20:57) more open sexually they'd be down to have thre sus they'd be down to go to orgies with you whereas a virgin maybe a
(4:21:04) virgin would not be as open to those sexual experiences why would why would a guy who's
(4:21:09) already why would a guy who is already um screening for low body count women
(4:21:15) why would he want to take I said a woman I said a woman I said guys who prefer a seasoned women you said why would guys
(4:21:21) prefer seasoned women if necessarily they aren't better in bed I'm saying maybe their sexual preferences and what
(4:21:27) they're open to so they're cuck no you said he wants to bring his girl to an orgy no I translation let
(4:21:34) other men [ __ ] her like being with a stripper I'd say she might be more open to using sex toys trying roleplay trying
(4:21:42) three but if you were to [ __ ] a virgin maybe she'd be kind of more closed off to
(4:21:47) those things that's what I mean by more is not this complicated procedure um look it's different for
(4:21:54) everyone but again I'll ask the question again because you didn't even give me an answer so the question is do you think
(4:21:59) most men do you think most men if they get a woman who's a bit better in bed
(4:22:07) the tradeoff being that she's [ __ ] 20 other dudes do you you think they most men
(4:22:13) make that trade-off what what trade-off is
(4:22:18) happening they're okay with her [ __ ] 20 more people because she's better in bed how can I ask you a question how
(4:22:24) would you feel if you didn't have breakfast this morning lightheaded okay um so okay the she she
(4:22:33) took that she took that round [Laughter]
(4:22:39) Brian I just I could repeat myself I don't know if that'll help you
(4:22:44) understand what what do you mean by tradeoff though he's okay with her [ __ ] 20 more people cuz she's a little bit better in bed okay so you're
(4:22:51) saying I think no matter how how she gets good in bed is none of your concern just be [ __ ] grateful that she's with
(4:22:57) you and she's [ __ ] you good whether she slept with 20 men before you or one guy for a long time like in my
(4:23:04) case but okay so you're saying that your position is
(4:23:12) that body count doesn't matter and one of the benefits of a woman who has more
(4:23:17) sex who has more b a higher body count is she's more seasoned she has more sexual experience and this is going to
(4:23:24) lead to conceivably better sex so I'm asking you do you think most men are
(4:23:31) willing to make that tradeoff of the woman is better in bed therefore I will
(4:23:38) accept a woman with a higher body count because she's better in bed
(4:23:43) yeah some guy wants a certified eater who will make him nut in 5 seconds or do
(4:23:49) he want the unexperienced girl who takes an hour to get him off like it's just it doesn't since when is it women who like
(4:23:56) y'all oh my God okay
(4:24:01) um so yeah there's men there's like some cummer [ __ ] dgen men I yeah I guess
(4:24:06) who would prefer that um do you think most men who like want a girlfriend
(4:24:13) do you think that those men who have a girlfriend and if the the girlfriend is
(4:24:19) not like up to par sexually although it's something that can be worked on and communicated and talked of he would be
(4:24:26) like you know what I just wish you came better experienced already and the
(4:24:31) entailment of that is that you've had an additional 20 sexual partners do they make the
(4:24:37) tradeoff no because like I said it's not causation higher bodies does not equal
(4:24:43) better and it's your position your position it oh my God bro your position
(4:24:49) is that a woman with a higher body count is more seasoned no all I said was it
(4:24:54) doesn't matter how she became good in bed that's none of your concern that should not be a judgment of character
(4:25:01) that should not be a defining factor in your relationship I feel like because like I said if there's no Health concern
(4:25:07) if there's no loyalty concern then what is the concern it's a matter of like objectifying something someone feeling
(4:25:12) like they're less worthy because they've experienced more that's just not a good way to Value
(4:25:18) someone um I agree with because they've been with more people like what you said it's object I agree that sex is like
(4:25:25) spiritual connections I'm not the type to just sleep around with anybody either like but some people choose to do that with their B so that doesn't make them
(4:25:31) any less of a person or any it makes them less worthy of worthy of being a girlfriend or any less loyal in a
(4:25:38) relationship no it doesn't do yes I think somebody I'm yes somebody who has a high body
(4:25:46) count is going to be deemed less desirable in the sexual Marketplace sorry this is this is a metric by which
(4:25:54) men determine whether they want to be with a woman some men but in the end at the end
(4:25:59) of the day if she never tells you how would you ever know like that really at the end of the day if she
(4:26:05) doesn't tell you that doesn't change anything in your relationship that doesn't make the sex any better or less it does not make the love any more or
(4:26:12) less it does not make her any more less promiscuous or loyal in a
(4:26:17) relationship that has nothing to do with the relationship or that specific person Okay cool so respond to this you just
(4:26:24) said if she doesn't tell you okay so if I ask her and she lies about it no I'm saying that it's not the end of the
(4:26:30) world because that's not a determining Factor it doesn't change anything physically in the relationship she lied
(4:26:36) about it you say you said if she doesn't no I'm saying at the end of the day if you never knew what her body count is
(4:26:42) what does that change in your relationship I can actually look I'll even give you a scenario where this could be an issue so woman who has more
(4:26:49) connections with men albeit this is kind of like uh one of the more like Niche
() 
(4:26:55) arguments that can be made a woman who's made more connections with men it's inevitable that she's landed on a
(4:27:00) [ __ ] crazy dude and if you're involved with a crazy [ __ ] ex then that's an issue for me that can be for
(4:27:07) girls who don't sleep around with people who have just poor taste in men or just experienced bad men in their life that
(4:27:13) doesn't equate to high body count either huh that doesn't equate to high body count people can have crazy exes without
(4:27:19) having but you think the virgin woman who's never had a long-term Rel be with an abusive man you got to stop
(4:27:26) interrupting the virgin woman who do you think is more likely to have done the
(4:27:32) the roulette until she's landed on a crazy [ __ ] the chick who's [ __ ] 100 dudes or
(4:27:39) the Virgin who what if the Virgin has only ever encountered the one horrible
(4:27:44) crazy AB I can't argue with somebody who just immediately every time goes to like the exception to the rule I just can't
(4:27:50) even have a conversation maybe a virgin wouldn't know her selfworth or like what else is out there in the dating field to
(4:27:57) pick better men and the Virgin is the one who ends up with those crazy exes cuz they don't have those sexual
(4:28:02) encounters with that actually makes those I mean
(4:28:08) from the from Brian's perspective basically you're just saying that the Virgin should go go out and have sex
(4:28:13) with more men so that she doesn't end up in experienced with men she's not having sex with that's what your argument there would reduce
(4:28:20) to wait you or me me you yeah oh wait what were you saying so what look I
(4:28:27) guess what what are acceptable metrics that men are allowed to disqualify a women on then their past relationships
(4:28:34) have you cheated on your past partners when you're in like a loyal committed exclusive relationship like have you
(4:28:40) gone through their phone or you know have you been cheated on those are I feel like determining factors of like
(4:28:46) past trauma future behaviors in relationships and like telltale signs of
() 
(4:28:51) like loyalty and such but you shouldn't what is considered toxic to you I think yeah like um not being
(4:29:00) respectful of like your opinions and your feelings and your if your boyfriend was going through your phone and Mak an argument with you every time he found a
(4:29:06) new girl on your phone wouldn't you actually like get pissed off oh yeah yeah my past relationship was tox and
(4:29:12) that's why my ex broke up with me I'm fully aware of that and I know I have baggage that needs to be healed I'm not
(4:29:17) dodging accountability what last question on this um do you think that it would be wrong for a guy to not want to
(4:29:24) date an ex sex worker that's not wrong I think that's just preference too
(4:29:30) but it's in her past right yeah so she stopped doing it she's
(4:29:35) not yeah he should be open to the idea of like she's a changed person as long as she won't do that to you it's should
(4:29:42) didn't matter what happened in her past it was just her way of making money you know it's not her being disloyal to you
(4:29:47) or disrespecting you and it won't happen again okay well uh let's see let's get
(4:29:54) into more of uh the uh questionnaire stuff uh women
(4:30:00) should go 50/50 on the date Bridget you disagreed Amelia you
(4:30:07) disagreed uh Emily also disagree especially on a first date that's crazy
(4:30:12) I think Deborah disagree Tanya also disagree what's crazy um that on going
(4:30:19) on first date the girl has to be expected to pay 50/50 of the date that you're inviting her on mhm so it's like
(4:30:25) if you're inviting me out to a date why do I have to pay if you're the one initiating this mhm so whoever asked
(4:30:31) should pay yeah have you ever asked a guy out on a date no interesting how that works a very privileg I'm I'm not
(4:30:39) like saying oh I would never pay or anything like no I have paid for um for guys I have bought them stuff I have been like in that Ro CL first on the
() 
(4:30:46) first date or like you're 5 years into a relationship never Five Years on the relationship I've never like the first day like offer like oh I'm going to take
(4:30:53) care of it don't worry like you have or you have not I have not and I don't think I would cuz I want to see if he's
(4:30:58) a provider or not if he's actually a man cuz those are like the the roles of a man am I wrong uh well okay let's I I'm
(4:31:07) interested in going into should claims on this so just show of hands going around the table should men pay for the
(4:31:13) first date should should for the first yeah into the mics guys yes yes yes yes
(4:31:20) Deborah yes yes I don't agree uh should should women cook and clean yes I do uh
(4:31:26) should women be submissive yes if the man is leading correctly the woman should be submissive should women
(4:31:34) um should women that be submissive job
(4:31:40) CH should women virgins be virgins yeah yeah yes how many any virgins at the
(4:31:47) table me okay I was with I'm a born again virgin born again virgin go ahead
(4:31:52) Andrew includ I was just asking you said if men are leading properly they should be
(4:31:58) submissive who's going to determine that the man is leading properly does it not say in the Torah or Bible or wherever
(4:32:04) you want to reference it as that a woman should submit to a husband who is worthy and loyal and provider biblical value it
(4:32:11) is cuz I'm I'm very religious that a man should and that's what I was saying beforehand where I stand by what I said
(4:32:17) that this generation not for many reasons not only their fault things that came before them the what it means I don't want to
(4:32:25) speak for men but overall I think if there has been a decline on both sides
(4:32:30) of gender roles and this is by Design in our society to take away gender roles and say that there's no difference
(4:32:35) between a man and a woman which I vly disagree with and overall I think that
(4:32:41) men should be worthy leaders there's a lot of crazy men just like there's a lot of crazy women but do you have your phone yeah did you not hear the
(4:32:49) instructions to not be on your phone oh I never put it back after I showed you the picture what's that I just didn't go
(4:32:55) back over there and put it back that's fine go ahead the picture sorry Deborah go no it's fine just I mean I I stand by
(4:33:00) what I said which I think that what it comes down to a man who can provide protect and show that he is a strong
(4:33:05) leader absolutely deserves a woman who can trust him and this is I think a big misalignment Within societ where I think
(4:33:13) deep down women really do want to submit to men they want to be able as we say in girl world just turn your brain off when
(4:33:18) you're on a date you don't have toin power where you're walking and you can really and what I said with the sourdough and nails and stuff like that
(4:33:25) clearly you don't understand jokes but that's just my style when it comes to speaking I think embracing your femininity women because we've been
(4:33:32) pushed into the workforce and had to unconsciously or unwillingly take on a lot of the male roles like being the
(4:33:39) provider being the protectors things of that nature has led women to not be able to embrace their femininity and so I
(4:33:45) think in a good relationship a man will be able to embrace and flourish and his masculinity and the same with the woman
(4:33:51) and whatever that means being a homekeeper being a matriarch being a really soft Landing space for her
(4:33:57) husband to land on and good providing that environment okay so my follow-up
(4:34:03) question to you would just be this then if that is the case and and this is what you believe if you if you actually
(4:34:10) wanted men to have the authority inside society and the responsibility why would
(4:34:16) you Advocate that women could vote because I think you keep deleting the
(4:34:22) most important part of this which is that not every single man right now and at large there is a lack of strong
(4:34:30) fathers there's a lot of things that lead into and this is not only a male problem there's a female problem too there are a lot of factors that lead
(4:34:36) into men this is like the man or the bear question if we get to that that
(4:34:42) I think not every man right now just being a man doesn't inherently make you worthy of being a leader I think that
(4:34:49) you have to show that you were a leader and this is true across the history of the world that every single uh Shepherd
(4:34:55) in the Torah in the original book was chosen for a lot of their specific qualities there's a reason why those men were chosen to be leaders same with
(4:35:01) Donald Trump there may be other men who share similar qualities to him but there's a reason why he was chos to lead
(4:35:06) as opposed to any random guy that you can maybe find on the side of the street in La who's cat calling women I think
(4:35:12) that men who are worthy and live up to what it means to be leaders and protectors and
(4:35:18) also have kind Hearts not not softies but just overall good men in my
(4:35:25) definition of it I think those men are worth leading and I don't think just because you're a man that automatically makes you a perfect amazing leader we've
(4:35:32) seen that throughout all of society so so how is this argument not actually contradictory because you're saying
(4:35:38) essentially that you need to reduce men's Authority because um because you don't think that
(4:35:45) they're in a good position to lead women you don't think that men in society are good enough leaders and since they're not good enough leaders you need to have
(4:35:52) authority so that when did I say and sorry to cut you off but I'm saying this is what this is when did I say of that
(4:35:58) I'm explaining I'm explaining this is this is an logical entailment of your argument if you say to me what I I'm
(4:36:05) advocating that women be able to vote because there's too many men in society who if we give authority to are going to
(4:36:11) lead me wrong then you're actually saying that you need to have authority so that you can
(4:36:16) determine who's a leader and who isn't a leader that actually is stripping Authority away from men like this is The
(4:36:22) Logical entailment I don't see a way around it no I think you're just taking it how you take it which no matter how I
(4:36:27) say it you're just interpreting it and saying what you want to say I've said a million times logical what's illogical
(4:36:34) about what I'm saying I didn't say the word illogical you keep taking what I say and then just changing what I'm
(4:36:40) saying and then saying so you're saying this and then when I say no I when did I say we should take power away from men
(4:36:46) when did I say that we should take power away from men when did I say that I'm showing you an entail I'm showing you
(4:36:51) the entailment of the logic here I I'll literally break it down really really simple here I'll show you so so premise
(4:36:56) one I don't need you to show me I need you to tell me when I said that because I'm saying what I say and you're telling me what you think I genuinely believe
(4:37:04) and you still won't address the point but he can talk over me whenever he wants then if I talk over him it's
() 
(4:37:10) because I'm a woman who wants to have men removed from look I've moderated Andrew tonight you got to let them
(4:37:15) finish how many times can you tell me what I think I said and what I think I mean just going
(4:37:21) to okay stop just go ahead Andrew so it's just it's just like this just premise one men need to lead okay
(4:37:28) premise two in order for men to lead they need to have authority premise three women need to vote premise four
(4:37:33) why this why why do women need to vote they need to vote because men aren't adequately leading so women need to have
(4:37:39) authority that's the entire syllogism so then the conclusion is men are not capable of leading so women need to have
(4:37:45) authority so that they can pick the men that need to lead them so it's it's actually stripping Authority away from men I don't I don't know a way around
(4:37:52) that like I'm I'm literally reing you still haven't addressed again that was
(4:37:57) not what I said I didn't say men need to lead I said they should lead ideal men ideally men should be the leaders of
(4:38:04) society but I don't think you still won't address 15 times over you're telling me what you think I said but you won't address the one point which is
(4:38:11) there has been a decline in what it means to be a man in terms of masculinity in terms of chivalry
(4:38:18) everything like that across the board there has been a decline so if you agree with me that men are not and this isn't
(4:38:24) only a male thing but just speaking about men as leaders that Men at Large there has been a decline of What men's
(4:38:30) role in society has been what they feel to be a man and all of that combined means that right now doesn't mean we
(4:38:35) should take authority away from Men's it's the one thing you won't address is that I think we as a society as women as
(4:38:41) men As Americans as whatever should work towards getting back to a place where men and women are more strong and
(4:38:49) embrace their femininity and their masculinity and I think that will lead us to a better place where women who can
(4:38:55) Embrace their femininity will naturally approach matriarchy they will naturally say wait maybe you know what I actually
(4:39:01) don't love my corporate job I know a lot of women who have convinced themselves that being powerful and that they need to work for 30 years and make a million
(4:39:08) dollars and then they'll have kids in their 40s and then I personally don't agree with that and I think that if we
(4:39:14) as a society get back to a place where originally women were not expected to be in the workforce things of that nature
(4:39:21) then men hopefully can recover in whatever that means to them and masculinity can become something that
(4:39:27) means more to them and is not seen as like tox I'm not done toxic masculinity all of that stuff I'm almost done you
(4:39:34) can wait all that toxic masculinity stuff has taught men are to feel bad
(4:39:39) about themselves and not Embrace their masculinity so I think the most important part of this is not stripping away power from men or saying women are
(4:39:45) better lead I think we need to focus on fixing that issue whether it's through strong fatherhood whether it's through
(4:39:51) stopping this idea that everybody's saying toxic masculinity anytime a man wants to actually act like a man opening
(4:39:56) the door for a woman and a woman gets offended I think moving away from that as a society will get us to a place
(4:40:02) where Men at Large will be better equipped to lead society and it doesn't mean that right now I'm not saying if I
(4:40:08) really meant it I would say it I'm not having any secret arguments I'm saying what I mean which is the step one I
(4:40:13) think ideally men should be the leaders and the step to get there is to fix masculinity that's what I'm saying so
(4:40:21) here so to address you keep saying I won't address this argument but the argument was my premise so the thing is
(4:40:26) is when you say okay but you haven't address what's going on with men in society and the lower testosterone and
(4:40:32) the fact that they're not leading as well but I actually did that was a premise of my original argument which is the reason that you see a failure in uh
(4:40:39) men in society is because they have all the respons responsibility without the authority they have the responsibility
(4:40:45) absent The Authority so I say okay so how do we fix that how do we fix the idea here that you have additional
(4:40:51) responsibilities without Authority that your your premise here is well we need to move back to all of these things
(4:40:57) which are preambles to women voting by the way that all these things that you're pointing to this is pre- women
(4:41:03) suffrage and so I go okay well that makes sense so then why is it then that you would say that men right who have
(4:41:10) this responsibility as Leaders right you wouldn't want them to have the authority to exercise that responsibility that
(4:41:17) seems like it's it's ultimately what you want what's going on is you have a an actual internal conflict here the the
(4:41:24) conflict is I want to be a strong empowered woman while at the same time advocating that there's a patriarchy
(4:41:29) it's like you can't have both patriarchy hang on hang on I hang on either the
(4:41:35) patriarchy is empowered with the authority to lead or it is not and if
(4:41:40) you say it's not empowered with the authority to lead women need to be able to select the leaders you have a
(4:41:46) matriarchy then not a patriarchy you're have you have a second class that has additional responsibilities women don't
(4:41:52) have but have a limited amount of Authority or equal authority to women that's the opposite of patriarchy it
(4:41:57) makes no sense you I just don't understand what position or where you're
(4:42:04) coming from where you consistently think that you know what I actually feel I'm having an internal conflict you don't
(4:42:09) know anything about my before the show maybe follow me I don't know no you're not listening to what I'm saying you're
(4:42:15) saying the opposite of what I say every single time and that's why it's just so frustrating I have an internal conflict because I want to be an empowered woman
(4:42:22) you're pushing what you clearly don't like about women onto me somebody that you clearly don't know much about or my
(4:42:28) P you can happily look through my social media listening to your arguments and based off of that you are saying that
(4:42:33) I'm clearly a secret feminist who has wants to be an empowered women woman finally said right for everybody
(4:42:40) else but you're telling me that based off absolutely what nothing absolutely nothing logic I'm showing you logic
(4:42:47) that's not logic that is you trying to push what you think about women onto me trying to catch me in something you a
(4:42:53) logical position when have I what have I said or what have I displayed throughout my life that shows that I want to be an
(4:42:59) empowered woman where men are on the sidelines and don't have power you are advocating that women vote if you
(4:43:05) Advocate women vote the entailment is women have authority well women can vote hang on hang on I'm answering your
(4:43:10) question question so if the entailment is that women have authority and equal authority to men that's not a patriarchy
(4:43:16) it's the opposite of a patriarchy that's no longer a patriarchy so if men have additional responsibility right but they
(4:43:22) only have equal Authority then they don't have the authority to lead they don't have the authority to lead because
(4:43:27) you can negate their Authority anytime you want that's the entailment of your logic when you say what have I displayed in my personal life has nothing to do
(4:43:35) with the logic of your argument it's an illogical argument makes no sense either you want men and a patriarchy so you
(4:43:41) want men to have the authority to lead and the responsibility thereof or you don't but you can't say but I need to be
(4:43:47) equal with them in political status for them to lead that's the opposite of your own position makes no sense no I don't
(4:43:53) live in a fantasy world I live in the current world where women do have the right to vote and if you are advocating
(4:43:58) for women being losing the right to vote that is something that I don't agree with and I don't know why you think
(4:44:03) women shouldn't vote if I think men should lead us right now it's not an option in front of me should women not
(4:44:10) have the right to vote women have the right to vote this isn't the 1800s like a lot of people want us to go back to
(4:44:15) apparently this is modern history and if you're asking me if I would repeal this no I would absolutely not if I think in
(4:44:21) an ideal Society men should be the leaders of society yes but I don't understand why you think you're catching
(4:44:26) you want to lead how do I want without authority to lead how well why do you think that the you said it yourself that
(4:44:32) the only reason the downfall of masculinity and all this stuff is because men don't have the authority to
(4:44:37) exercise their leadership that's the only reason that men and masculinity is declines that's ridiculous I think
(4:44:45) that's ridiculous it's not listen it's not all the all all the things that you would consider like if I told you to
(4:44:51) point to a time where you thought men were strong leaders you'd point the British generation that my grandpa hang on you would you would you would you
(4:44:57) would point to pre suffrage if I asked you when were men better men you'd point to prese suffrage if I asked you any of
(4:45:02) these things you would point to pre suffrage how do you know you haven't asked me this is exactly what you've been doing the whole time you have this
(4:45:08) idea when were men better men tell me yeah this I answer when were men better
(4:45:14) men I'm asking you you want me to ask you I'm asking you when were men better men this is why it's just not even like
(4:45:20) I could go back and forth with you but everything I've said this entire time I give you a solid answer and you flip it
(4:45:26) and say well you think this you think that because you're just trying to men were men better men just answer please
(4:45:33) entertain this anymore you want you want to answer you're not going to answer question because it doesn't matter what I answer to you you think you know what
(4:45:39) I believe and you're going to tell me what I despite every other question you've
(4:45:44) asked me you've had the same reaction and so I just don't think there's any
(4:45:49) point of me telling you something because whatever I say you brought it up you brought it up and so I'm I've said a
(4:45:54) thousand times what I think and you keep telling me I'm going undercover this I really think this L asking you a
(4:46:00) question when were better I just when when were men better men can you answer the
(4:46:05) question I don't know why we need to like do a bunch of emotional Outburst can you just answer emotional Outburst you called me a covert feminist saying
(4:46:11) all these personal attacks because I said what that I think women should vote no I'm giving you declarative statements of fact I haven't personally attacked
(4:46:18) you at all so the thing is is like just just very quickly can you just tell me when you think men were better men when
(4:46:25) what's the time period I'm not going to of course not of course not right okay can I do I can't I I can't force her to
(4:46:32) engage in the uh conversation but uh Deborah why we uh get through your uh
(4:46:38) your notes here um so and we'll get the we'll get everybody
(4:46:44) on the panel here uh what would you want the minimum yearly income to be for your future husband I wrote this on the chart
(4:46:50) I said 200,000 I'm from New York city so that's a pretty that's not like a crazy number I
(4:46:57) think in smaller cities you could have less but in New York I think you need to make at least 150,000 to live comfortably between taxes and everything
(4:47:04) so I think that's a good starting salary where you can be comfortable even on a single income if I would have the
(4:47:10) pleasure of being a stay-at home mom one day all right you also said uh or actually leton let this come through
(4:47:17) before meet the Kaiser donated $200 dating is hard every time the one
(4:47:25) girl at the beginning that I say hey she seems nice she's cute always ends up
(4:47:30) being the one in a thumbnail with Andrew the next day this is the Ker's
(4:47:37) curse the one girl at the beginning uh oh okay uh Kaiser thank you so much for
(4:47:43) the TTS man I do appreciate it and uh I'll let the other chats come through in a bit but uh so how tall are you Deborah
(4:47:50) and what's the minimum height of a man that you would date I am 5' n and the minimum height for me would be 6 fet
(4:47:57) because I am 6 feet in heels but I have the longest relationship I've ever been in he was actually like 5'9 and a half
(4:48:04) because I really do believe in like I'm just one of those people that I can think people are cute when I meet them but I eventually actually get feeling
(4:48:11) based off their personality and who they are okay uh and then I want to it'd be
(4:48:16) nice to get everybody back seated at the table here for this one but uh I want to get into the bear thing so but not
(4:48:23) everybody's here so I have to wait uh while while we're waiting I will let some chats come through we have Lucas
(4:48:30) who's fed you this delusion based on the generally stated metrics I fall in the top 5% I guarantee you that my wife's
(4:48:37) past sexual Temperance was a huge litmus test for me marrying her it's a monster
(4:48:42) ick for us do you have a response to this well I'm glad that that's your
(4:48:49) determinating factor for who you marry mhm can you take the water off the table please mhm uh and then we have beat and
() 
(4:48:56) cheeks he says I have an idea how about grifting feminist conservatives like Deb
(4:49:01) stop trying to be argumentative show some respect perhaps you'll be taken serious lower your entitled standards
(4:49:09) then you'll be happy do you want respond to beaten cheeks you spelled respect long wrong how dare you beaten
(4:49:17) you I just think it's funny that people will always try and say oh you're an
(4:49:23) undercover feminist like haters not genuine people people say you're a feminist you're a fake conservative it's
(4:49:28) always the extreme far right people who say this because maybe I don't share the exact same version of conservatism as
(4:49:34) they do and that doesn't change anything about me I just think it's a dumb argument because look at my record
(4:49:40) across the board I have been doing amazing things for the conservative movement for Republican candidates in this country for conservative values in
(4:49:46) my community and across the World At Large so I mean I just don't get personally offended by anybody who
(4:49:52) doesn't know me saying things about me because that's what being social media person's all about people think they
(4:49:58) know you I happen to actually have a book here called he has a book guys
(4:50:04) that's crazy the secret the secret history of women's Liberation written by
(4:50:09) a um well a a wonderful academic um but she goes over the roots of feminism and
(4:50:16) the contrary positions that feminists will often take and one of the contrary positions which we were just discussing
(4:50:22) that freaks you out so badly that so you get so emotional you can't even have a coherent conversation about it but what
(4:50:28) she she's trying to demonstrate is that most of the problems in modernity that you're speaking about are tied to the
(4:50:34) suffrage movement themselves and she makes a very compelling case for this I suggest you pick up her book it's called
(4:50:40) a feminism the secret history of women's Liberation very good you called me a mandress but you
(4:50:46) clearly just get off on putting women down and that's what I just think is silly about this whole situation I've been trying to have a reasonable
(4:50:53) discussion with you and you've been freaking out the entire time this is exactly like I just I think you're showing your true colors in this sense
(4:50:59) where what I said in the beginning still stands true you're trying you're an emotional woman you're this you're
(4:51:05) freaking out when you've had the same response to me and you were so proud to make a woman cry and tell her you should
(4:51:11) be crying even though I AG I think the situation was a very bad situation but I
(4:51:17) don't think trying to make somebody you want to make for horrific people no I
() 
(4:51:22) think that that's a bad act but I think as a person who wants to represent Godly values just going out of your way to
(4:51:28) make somebody cry and be proud of that is not a thing to be proud of I think you can get your point across and have
(4:51:34) somebody come to the light in other ways and if that makes me a fake conservative that I don't think I should go out of my
(4:51:39) way to attack people people with my words that I can use my words to change their mind and their heart she has a man she has a man sleeping in a bed on her
(4:51:46) floor defend her harder go ahead I've never defended it the whole time we had a conversation about that I said
(4:51:51) multiple things are you going to let me talk you every time I talk you talk over
(4:51:57) me but then when you talk I have to shut up lady you talk five times as much as me calm down tell me to calm down please
(4:52:03) thank you I did you can't be like I'm just going to filibuster the conversation talk for 20 minutes and you
(4:52:10) can have 30 seconds Andrew it's ridiculous I've listened to you and I've caught myself relx it's like relax you
(4:52:16) could just have the conversation without freaking out it's not any other things you want to say to a woman like that cut me off again cutting me off again you
(4:52:22) definitely don't need to defend the horrible acts of horrible I'm not defending I'm condemning you for the way
(4:52:28) you deliver that I'm not defending her acts whatsoever I said straight up that having a child in that environment is
(4:52:35) repeating the cycle point this is me for okay here I'll move the conversation on
(4:52:40) okay guys look I mean can I just get a point out like you don't can I just get a point out can I just get a point out stop freaking out buddy babe just take a
(4:52:47) breath just take a chill just relax it's okay you don't have to be so emotional it's fine it's okay fre just don't freak
(4:52:53) out just smoke your SS and take a breath just smoke your and take a beat sping out calm down I'm just saying to defend
(4:53:01) horrible people to ATT it's not necessary you just attack okay you're okay Andrew as somebody with autism I'm very offended yeah very offended I'm
(4:53:08) deep I'm very triggered Andrew how dare you use that I mean you thinking the combo is a good
(4:53:13) look it's not a good artistic no he didn't he called you a no he didn't no he said you were spering out he didn't
(4:53:20) say you were Aspergers or autistic that just really shows how Godly you are do you have
(4:53:26) autism though do you think I have autism no I'm not I'm not I'm not coming for you Deborah I'm just I'm asking if you
(4:53:32) do like it's not an attack I I'm probably autistic got that dog this is a point I'm trying to get commonality I'm
(4:53:38) trying to get like no we don't have autism in if we have we're still awful people all right guys we're going to
(4:53:44) move it on we're going to move it on I yeah uh so okay the bear we got to do the bear guys we're doing the bear uh
(4:53:51) maybe I'll just she's in the oh my God bro everybody's getting up okay uh how
(4:53:57) about before I come to the bear I'm going to get the other people's um so what would you want the minimum yearly
(4:54:02) income to be for your future husband um I mean can you til your mic down just a bit
(4:54:10) I mean I would say I don't care um yeah do you you want to get married maybe you
(4:54:16) don't I'm not sure right now I'm still in the process of getting divorced so you know give me some time okay uh okay
(4:54:24) we're going to come back to that we'll go right into the bear now so going around the table starting with Deborah
(4:54:30) would you rather cross paths with a man or a bear in the forest I love this question um
(4:54:37) especially when it was all over social media I thought there was a lot of funny Tik toks I wrote the bear I thought about it long and hard um I think it's
(4:54:45) just the white woman in me that I really do believe I could tame the bear honestly and that or at least hide from
(4:54:50) it and I it's a joke don't don't cry it's a joke it's okay I I joke sometimes
(4:54:56) I like comedy but I I don't know why you're still freaking out I didn't say anything it just shows a face okay so I
(4:55:03) overall I think anybody I saw in the forest I would be scared for my life if I was alone in the forest a man or a woman and I'd rather see an animal cuz
(4:55:10) cuz that's where they live and then I can hide from it but I think it's a silly question and it's funny so you
(4:55:16) pick the bear though I I do pick the bear because that's where it lives and it's not crazy to be like why is there a
(4:55:23) bear in the forest but if you're alone in the woods and you see another man or woman walking I'd be like wait why are they here too that's conceivably the
(4:55:30) same reason you are to go walk in the woods Oh I thought I was like trapped in the far I thought I don't know I guess I
(4:55:37) assume this question is like you're lost in the forest well the way I worded it here in the questionnaire it just says
(4:55:42) would you rather cross paths with a man or a bear in the forest this doesn't there there are no implications as to
(4:55:47) the reasons why anybody's in the forest there are no there's no uh suggestions that the man is a criminal he could be a
(4:55:53) criminal he could not he could be a murderer he could not the bear could be uh nonthreatening the bear could also
() 
(4:56:01) want to kill you so I don't know why I assumed on my own that I was like trapped in the forest like in the movie
(4:56:06) or in the show alone where you're just like lost in the woods if I was just on a walking path definitely a man over a
(4:56:11) bear I would say hello I'm a very social person but you said you've heard this question before you've seen all of the
(4:56:17) social media even then you still pick bear no at that point I guess there was just a lot of you wrot bear you wrote
(4:56:22) bear and you said bear because I thought the question was like if you're lost in the woods stranded I don't know why I
(4:56:28) thought that I think that's what a lot of the social media videos were about and imp they were like if you're lost in the woods would you rather run into a
(4:56:34) bear or a man I was thinking about it like that I you lost in the woods yes I guess I just didn't read this clear
(4:56:41) enough oh I I've never heard it phrased like you're lost in the woods cuz if you're lost in the woods I'm assuming
(4:56:48) you can't get out so wouldn't you want to run into like a man in the hopes of like he can oh it's this way got Compass
(4:56:56) well that's what the argument is about that would you rather if like let's say you're lost in the woods and you needed help would you rather run into a bear
(4:57:03) where you would have a threat or a man because men can do things they might help you but they also might you know
(4:57:09) what and I'll let every sure I'll let everybody answer uh going around the table would you rather cross paths with
(4:57:14) a man or a bear whatever you responded into the questionnaire just say man man
(4:57:19) man is that what you wrote in the yeah I would not want to come across you did say man okay what about you bear bear uh
(4:57:27) what about you bear all right what about you I said bear but I took the question exactly how
(4:57:33) she did so I would change it to a man okay and then bear bear uh so those
(4:57:40) those of you who said bear going around again uh why do you pick bear and why do
(4:57:45) you not pick the man why we start with debor you already provided some explanation but if you want to add
(4:57:51) anything go ahead but yeah I'll just quickly add honestly I didn't read it close enough I should have not close
(4:57:56) enough I just didn't understand the context of it well even using yes okay so but so why do you pick bear and why
(4:58:02) don't you pick man is this if I'm trapped in the forest or if I'm just taking a leisurely
(4:58:07) walk um much even so even if you're not trapped in the forest you always pick
(4:58:13) men yeah I don't want to be killed by a bear if I'm in like a safe environment on a walking path I wouldn't be scared
(4:58:19) to see a man in the forest but I think overall women the question why this originally came to light is because can
(4:58:24) you really trust just a random man in the forest who might have be a psychopath or a murderer or any of these
(4:58:31) things let's just stick with the beend let's just what what is it are you walking or
(4:58:36) trapped uh I CH do you get why my that makes sense
(4:58:43) me logically like if I'm trapped in the forest I think I have good survival skills and I grew up very outdoorsy
(4:58:50) urban New York I live in Manhattan but I grew up we have AO surviv skills yes my
(4:58:56) family go to Montanas in the summer we learned how to build clay pigeons I went to sleep away camp I learned how to sail
(4:59:02) from like 5 years old and up horseback riding okay why just quick answer if you can why do you pick bear why don't you
(4:59:09) pick men who yeah you oh um I would not pick a
(4:59:15) why I wouldn't pick either sorry sorry why do you pick bear why don't you pick
(4:59:21) the man I would pick a bear because I'm trapped I'm sorry I'm not trying to be
(4:59:27) annoying I'm just trying to understand the question so I can give a real answer if I'm trapped I genuinely mean what I
(4:59:32) said where I've been in nature a lot in Montana and the forest and everything bears for the most part unless you upset
(4:59:39) them or you do something something you can kind of just chill out they're not going to just necessarily go after you and the reason I didn't pick a man is
(4:59:45) because I feel like anybody outside of homesteaders who were just hanging out in the middle of the woods would see me
(4:59:52) and be like yo she would be a really good person to trap in my house but then they'd be like she talks a lot so I
(4:59:57) don't know if I want to keep her so there's that you can Yap your way out of out of the abduction I guess uh what
(5:00:04) about you uh my logic was I have a better chance of fighting a man than a
(5:00:09) bear oh wait so sorry um who picked ver just show a hands again okay so boom boom
(5:00:15) boom I took boom yeah okay uh why do you pick bear why don't you pick
(5:00:21) men um cuz there was like this one rhyme about how to survive when you encounter
(5:00:27) like each color bear like a white bear black bear brown bear I don't remember how it goes I'm going have to refresh my
(5:00:33) memory before I go out into the woods but it was like it was like oh for one bear you got to like make look big for
(5:00:41) one of the Bears you should make yourself look small or like be still as possible and for one of the Bears you
(5:00:46) just run so I think knowing those kind of ground rules would help me survive and like you said it's a bear's natural
(5:00:53) habitat like I'm the one disturbing its peace so I would just leave it alone but a male you know you can be ESS they have
(5:01:00) all these different torture methods in their head that probably a bear wouldn't conjure up or access to these different
(5:01:06) weapons y sure so okay um could be assade could be murdered totally get it what about you okay so I would have pick
(5:01:13) the bear because I used to live in Lake Arrowhead and I see Bears all the time and if you don't bother bother them they're not going to do anything to you
(5:01:18) and I would not pick a man because uh of
(5:01:23) my horrible experiences with men my first grade um third grade crush he had
(5:01:28) intentions of going to the mountains to um are me and then M me and it was
(5:01:36) just like third grade no like I met him in third grade he was my first and years later we reconnected and I
(5:01:43) know his hidden agenda and this a guy that I knew so imagine a random man that I don't know to if he had that intention
(5:01:49) to do that to me what's a random man going to see a pretty girl in the forest walking around so all right so the man
(5:01:56) could essay or could murder you okay uh what about you why don't you or why do you pick bear why don't you pick man um
(5:02:02) I picked the bear because I definitely have bear spray if I'm in the woods so I come prepared um which would conceivably
(5:02:09) be just as effective on a man but um I don't know the man's intentions I know
(5:02:15) the Bear's intentions I like that who who would be able to charge you
(5:02:20) faster a man or a bear a bear um I mean probably the bear but I mean so would
(5:02:27) the bear spray be just as effective on the man I would still choose the bear okay
(5:02:34) and so um so I didn't mean to interrupt you though uh you were explaining why you pick the bear why don't you pick the
(5:02:39) the man uh you were mentioning you had bear spray what else I don't know the man's intentions why is he in the woods
(5:02:45) what's he doing there sure why am I walking across him yeah so just um I
(5:02:52) guess I would feel more scared seeing a man than a bear okay and the fear there
(5:02:57) would be he could potentially sa you he could murder you is that yeah I mean I don't I don't know his intentions right
(5:03:03) but those that's the concern I'm assuming right yeah okay um and then if I do change the the question a little
(5:03:10) bit I don't know if this will elicit a different response uh you randomly spawn in the forest you then like Survivor
(5:03:16) they Dr me off just engage you randomly spawn in the forest uh hold on okay you randomly
(5:03:24) spawn in the forest in front of you two buttons also randomly spawn you can pick
(5:03:30) a random man to spawn or you can pick a random bear to spawn you will cross paths with either one it's not like
(5:03:37) they're you will cross paths does that change your answer at all or I would choose the man then really yeah I feel
(5:03:44) like you know it's not like it's random if I'm choosing you know and if I'm just
(5:03:49) dropped off there um and it's not like I would have bear spray you know handy if
(5:03:55) I expect to encounter a bear so yeah but you wouldn't have the bear spray for the man either yeah but it's different it's
(5:04:02) randomly spawned right it's not like someone's just there waiting and I just stumble upon them this is the context of
(5:04:09) the change anything for you or no still be I mean I've encountered Bears multiple timesing so still be still bear
(5:04:16) okay um I think it would change for me a little bit because then also it's not like why are you doing in the woods we
(5:04:21) can make like friendship over the fact we both just spawned you know this is interesting that how like you frame a
(5:04:26) question even by just changing it slightly can change people's answers I mean this is actually really common with studies and why I think these like
(5:04:32) survey studies are actually [ __ ] because you can like change one word like you can even change a totally
(5:04:38) benign non word in a study and you'll get a different response from people but
(5:04:43) um anyways back to the point at hand uh if you had to um oh sorry go ahead yeah
(5:04:52) so it is it would almost occur to me though those of you who like kind of change your answer wouldn't like
(5:05:00) wouldn't there be a bigger fear for the button push because like you say why is
(5:05:05) the man there in the forest but I kind of feel like there
(5:05:10) would be more reason for him being in the forest that seems benign versus like
(5:05:17) you random like you randomly spawn the guy like the guy in the forest is probably just going on a hike or some [ __ ] I don't know I don't know maybe I
(5:05:25) have trauma for men people do things also when nobody's looking that's what creates it like when people are in
(5:05:30) private environments that's why a lot of essays happen and close doors go out so let me let me get through a couple more
(5:05:36) things here um so your concern you guys's concern is like the risk of sa
(5:05:41) and the risk that they physically harm you murder you whatever um what what percentage of men do you think would be
(5:05:48) like what percentage of men do you think would do this to
(5:05:53) you 30% 30% okay what about you 90% because how that almost happened to me
() 
(5:06:00) 90% okay like 20 20% and then Deborah what per say like 15ish 15 so that was
(5:06:09) uh I'm sorry did you said 20 what 30 excuse me so it's 30 90 20 and then
(5:06:17) 15 okay I'm just curious for uh you guys have any male siblings
(5:06:23) do you have a brother how many brothers do you have I have one older brother okay um do you have a brother I have two brothers okay um are you prepared to say
(5:06:31) that 90% of your male family members including cousins would essay or murder
(5:06:36) woman I think there's like a small percentage of men that will do that not not counting my family cuz you said it was 90% amount yeah well my chances were
(5:06:43) 90% I missed it about an hour that happening to me in the forest with a man that I knew that I I liked first no but
(5:06:50) you said 90% of men so this would have to oh actually I I I retract that statement sorry so I guess there's a
(5:06:56) small percentage of men that would do that what percent maybe 5% then oh now that I've thrown your 90% of your family
(5:07:03) under yeah so you did that I was like no but made more sense 30% of your male family members uh are Grapist or
(5:07:11) murderers um most of them are dead but I mean I was almost essayed by a family
(5:07:16) member when I was three so yeah okay and then going to you uh 20% of your family
(5:07:23) members are inclined to Grape or murder not my family just like the
(5:07:29) general population like 20% of all men what makes your family is so much Superior well cuz I haven't experienced
(5:07:37) anything like that with my family members I was not thinking of the general population of men like and deor
(5:07:42) you willing to throw 15% of your family members uh not because of this I knew this question was coming next I still
(5:07:48) thought 15 when I said it was a little bit Grand but I was also thinking about Society at large but no definitely not
(5:07:54) in my family they're very much value protecting women being strong men making
(5:07:59) sure like I said and Tak care of and also on this uh does it change for
(5:08:04) anybody here if it's 10 men versus 10 Bears wait sor was that 10 men versus 10
(5:08:11) bearss so awkward to see in a forest does that change anything for the
(5:08:16) bear 10 men at the same time yeah 10 men together 10 Bears together and you cross
(5:08:22) paths with them i' rather see 10 men does that change anything for you maybe I still stick with bears yeah I need a second to process I still stick with
(5:08:29) Bears still stick with bear what about you H I don't know either well do you
(5:08:36) need time or Deborah I'm thinking if they're good men then men if they're not good men then bears are they the island
(5:08:43) are they sorry what said are they Boy Scouts are army it's just random men then yeah
(5:08:51) out of the population I think the men would be better because if I like I gave my number I think it's a very small
(5:08:57) percentage of men in society who really have that within them to take advantage of a woman and overpower her and I do
(5:09:03) think given it's 10 men hopefully the majority of them are good men like the kind of guys who hold their friends in
(5:09:09) check that are like don't do that or you need to treat her better so I'd like to think that with 10 men there'd be at
(5:09:14) least the majority of them would be good men and keep the peace hopefully if you were in the position where you guys had
(5:09:21) to choose for somebody else in this case your daughter you're not choosing for you but instead you're choosing your
(5:09:27) daughters spawned into a forest with a random man or a random bear would your answer change no
(5:09:33) yes yes yes my answer would not change so way you would change from men to I know I I've really well if it's a fe I
(5:09:40) would say female bear oh well I'd say female Bears yeah because animals tend to be more protective over children
(5:09:46) innocent children there's been stories of like children falling in zoos and gorillas pick them up and take care of
(5:09:52) them so I don't know not Bears though like wait oh I really quick on
(5:09:57) that really quick on that um Okay zoo enclosure would you prefer your daughter to fall in the gorilla enclosure or the
(5:10:05) human male enclosure gorilla harambe all day
(5:10:12) harambe I guess it because the intention of the bear or the [ __ ] human you
(5:10:17) know whatever I I don't I guess it could go either way I I don't how bad intentions people do it's my daughter a
(5:10:24) man because I don't think she could outrun a bear does this not highlight the difference in society though that we
(5:10:29) have to think about it and that men if they were put in this they would never think twice about being put with 10
(5:10:34) women or 10 Bears give me the girls all day long does that not speak to women and and Men I guess maybe I would choose
(5:10:41) the men I just think it's all intention you would CH you would change your answer to Bear Che I I know I'm I'm
(5:10:48) so indecisive I I would like to say I would like to say men but it's because animals don't have bad intentions and
(5:10:54) people do animals do some whack things in nature though animal predictable hang hang on
(5:11:02) guys guys guys on the pan just one second real quick Sor uh J One what were you saying I was saying if it's between
(5:11:09) you know my three-year-old being in the woods coming upon a man or a bear I
(5:11:14) would choose the man because you know why do you think that the man would not
(5:11:19) if you if you think that uh you have the high likelihood that a man would essay you or do something horrible to you uh
(5:11:26) why is it that you think you wouldn't do that to her um I think it would be more likely
(5:11:31) for me because I'm a woman she's a child so I think he would be more opted to protect her unless he's a Poe so so so
(5:11:40) if so if it if you had to choose behalf of somebody else well let's say your daughter was
(5:11:47) 17 would you make the same decision she'd be better off with the bear at that point so you would Spawner in with
(5:11:54) the bear rather than a random man yes so assuming for all everybody in
(5:11:59) the panel if you you have a 17-year-old daughter and you have to choose would your would your answer change from bear
(5:12:05) to man those of you who selected bear no no still be bear that almost happened to me when I was 17 so why would not happen
(5:12:11) to her yeah if you were in an argument with your significant other and the two
(5:12:16) of you had to choose for some reason that if she spawned in with a man or the bear and he said the man and you said
(5:12:23) the bear would you defa to his judgment yes no
(5:12:29) no okay I make that decision CU I trust him if I'm married to
(5:12:34) him gotcha okay I'm going to have experience what's that so I'm going off
(5:12:40) experiences that I've had so I'm not saying all men are the same but just like how many bears have you seen a lot
(5:12:46) actually like Arad and how many you five I can that were like in close encounter
(5:12:52) with me too like so and they didn't do anything but walked the other way went to trash can valid question I was amazed at how many women who answer this on the
(5:12:58) bear question make claims of of of how many bears they've seen I mean I go in
(5:13:04) the wilderness constantly I have my entire life I've been a hunter my essentially my entire adulthood and uh
(5:13:10) I've only ever had actually two random bear encounters and in totality and I mean I'm out all the time in country
(5:13:18) which is bare country where do you live so maybe animal attracted to me go mean
(5:13:23) I've hunted all over the us but uh right now I'm in Michigan um and uh yeah
(5:13:29) definitely tons of black bears in Michigan especially in the grounds I hunt and it's like very rarely do you ever come across them but somehow the
(5:13:36) women who answer to this question seem to have seen significantly more bears than I have many
(5:13:44) videos went to camp in I went to camp in Pennsylvania and the Bears would eat the trash every
(5:13:50) single week like literally multiple times a week and so there was always bear stuff so we had to learn very young
(5:13:55) like what to do with bears I feel like they're pretty common in Pennsylvania all over and the East Coast they're
(5:14:01) common for me they're common at they're common at campgrounds especially when there's garbage around and stuff like
(5:14:07) that I agree with that but random in the forest are they're pretty rare right they're pretty R you know I spent 6
(5:14:12) months out in the wilderness in like high school and I never once encountered a bear I encountered all kinds of
(5:14:17) different things but never like a random bear just popped up out of nowhere I saw an elk and a bear in Montana are pretty
(5:14:24) common all right um together no but like a few minutes apart Elks are huge I've never seen I see them all Washington
(5:14:32) chased you brought up double standards earlier and this does fall into a line with one of the questionnaire questions
(5:14:37) not hypocritical for high body count men to prefer to date low body count or
(5:14:44) virgin women uh Deborah you disagree disagreed I think I messed up
(5:14:49) on that one okay that's Fine's um not hypocritical for high body count men
(5:14:54) yeah I think fair I think that's totally valid uh I don't know why I circled that sorry cie you did disagree I think that
(5:15:00) was fair too yeah Amelia you disagreed on that actually I didn't understand the
(5:15:07) question Emily you also disag okay okay you did also disagree Emily nothing for
(5:15:13) honestly Karina you did not uh disagree on anything Tanya
(5:15:19) disagreed yeah so um it was like double standard right you think it's a double
(5:15:25) standard like if a guy with a high body count he would prefer to dated woman with a low body count or a
(5:15:31) virgin oh sorry yes what's wrong with that oh let me
(5:15:37) hold on before I have you answer I'm going to let this through then we'll get right back to it practicing
() 
(5:15:42) gentleman donated $200 if it was a starved bear or an evil man and both were fully intent on making
(5:15:50) sure you had a bad day with nothing happening being the best outcome which do you think you could escape from
(5:15:58) misia if it was a starved bear and an evil man and both were fully intent on
(5:16:03) making sure you had a bad day oh God maybe an nothing happening being the best outcome
(5:16:09) yeah so the the intentionality this is a really good phrasing of this so now we know the intention the bear wants to eat
(5:16:14) your face and the man wants to eat your face so both of them definitely have
(5:16:20) really want you to have the worst day of your life spawned in and you can choose between them does your answer change
(5:16:26) then biologically a bear would be 10 times stronger 10 times faster and 10 times more aggressive than an evil man I
(5:16:32) can gadge his eyes out and or like try to fight for my life but I can't really fight for my life with a bear so it would be harder change anything for you
(5:16:39) do I have the bear spray if I have the bear spray what should say in both cases you have the bear spray I would choose the
(5:16:47) bear on a bear yeah well if he can't [ __ ] see he can't find me uh yeah I
(5:16:54) think I'd still choose the bear how how fast can bears run still bear Deborah
(5:16:59) fast um no it would probably be a man because I don't know where bare parts
(5:17:04) are to kick them in honestly it be kind of hard to Gad his eyes out when they're so big so and I could be taller than the
(5:17:11) man which is very likely because I'm very tall a bear no chance no chance with the bear uh so going back to the
(5:17:17) double standard question though uh not hypocritical for highb count uh men to
(5:17:23) prefer to date low body count virgin women uh you disagreed I think maybe you
(5:17:28) disagreed c yeah you did um what what would actually be wrong with like a guy who's got a high body count preferring
(5:17:35) to date a low body count woman or a virgin or what makes it hyp critical I guess yeah I wouldn't I mean right
(5:17:41) preference is just preference but I think it's hypocritical because Practice What You Preach so if you think that you
(5:17:47) know your partner should have less partners then you should have less Partners as well that's hypocritical that's I'll I'll respond to that but uh
(5:17:54) em Emily what about you yeah I agree verbatim and then same thing I was trying to get out yeah I also I think
(5:18:00) now I realize I did mean to Circle that question yeah me too you're the minority
(5:18:06) here please speak on this one yeah oh yeah well I mean I guess you know a lot
(5:18:11) of you also kind of simultaneously uh circled women uh
(5:18:17) should go 50 or you disagree that women should go 50-50 on first AIDS why is it that women are allowed to H hold men to
(5:18:24) standards that they themselves would not you know uphold themsel for example if
(5:18:29) your position is men should pay for First Dates wouldn't you be hypocritical for saying that for like the other
(5:18:36) person should pay for the first dat wouldn't that make you a hypoc I didn't hold that position okay well but the other a lot of the other women here said
(5:18:43) men should pay for first AIDS women should not go 50/50 it is H so why is it that if a man desires a trait in a
(5:18:51) partner that he doesn't himself possess why are women allowed to do this very
(5:18:57) thing with like the Myriad of traits that they desire in men but they don't possess themselves I'll give you more
(5:19:03) examples besides just women wanting men to pay for first AIDS but you guys won't pay for a first date ever so how about
(5:19:11) you want a guy who's taller than you but you're not tall you want a guy who's funny but you're not funny you want a
(5:19:18) guy who's charismatic but you're not charismatic you want a guy to lead but you're not a leader you want a guy to be
(5:19:23) dominant but you're not dominant you want the guy to be masculine but you're not masculine the reality is is that
(5:19:29) there's all kinds of asymmetries when it comes to dating but you guys are totally fine with the asymmetries that benefit
(5:19:35) you but when there's an asymmetry that doesn't benefit you you'll frequently you'll just say that's a double standard
(5:19:41) can I respond to that sure I think that that is the obvious like the most obvious not non-argument I guess in a
(5:19:48) sense where those are all traits that you listed being funny being not funny things of that those are traits characteristics but characteristics but
(5:19:55) sexual partners is choices that you make every single time and there are health risks associated with it is Chastity a
(5:20:02) choice or sorry no excuse me is Chastity a trait is being virgin being a virgin a
(5:20:09) trait it's a virtue I mean it's definitely the people that hold that with their life near and dear I think
(5:20:15) waiting till marriage is absolutely a trait and that's why if you wanted that's something not a trait I think it's a value not a trait I think that's
(5:20:21) a value so so hold on so you're saying that uh uh the amount of sexual partners
(5:20:27) you've had that is what decisions and
(5:20:33) choices wait so I can't huh no like if you choose to have sex with 100 women
(5:20:38) that was your choice to make every single time but if you're funny like I don't think you can choose to be funny
(5:20:44) or not or things of that nature you can't choose to be tall what is someone's choice to do or not do
() 
(5:20:50) something how what does that have to do with the argument because you can have values those traits if you want somebody
(5:20:55) who doesn't match your trait that's different than not matching your values if I say I'm funny or I'm not I think
(5:21:00) I'm funny hold on I I have to interrupt you Deborah you said that the you want a guy with a to make a minimum income of
(5:21:08) 200,000 that's a choice he's taking specific
(5:21:14) actions yeah I think that's a choice that benefits himself but I I think making
(5:21:20) money you wait just just so I understand the argument the argument is men are not allowed to disqualify women based on
(5:21:28) women's choices they can only they can only disqualify based on traits no I
(5:21:34) think you can totally disqualify in anything you want because it's your partner that you're looking for but when it comes to just the body count alone or
(5:21:41) not the body count but a man who has had multiple sexual partners why does he want a woman with less sexual partners
(5:21:47) is it because he values the fact that a woman is not promiscuous because that's different and those are different values
(5:21:54) if you yourself are no offense to anybody here but if you're filming only fans and you're saying I want somebody
(5:21:59) who's a religious God-fearing Christian that's not those are choices that you're both making but I don't think it's fair
(5:22:06) or normal to expect that and so in the same way way it depends on the value behind it I think having a high number
(5:22:11) of sexual partners corresponds with your values and therefore I don't think it's
(5:22:17) as simple as I want somebody taller than me or things like that but when it comes to splitting the money I so wait let's
(5:22:22) try help me categorize this so promiscuity is not a trait it's a value
(5:22:30) no I think it can be a prom being sexually promiscuous I think can definitely be a trait that people have
(5:22:36) there's also people that go through phases where like they might celibate and then I don't know or they like abstain from sex I think every if you
(5:22:43) have a let's say you've had sex with 100 women I think every single time even when you got to 75 you chose to keep
(5:22:49) going that's your individual choice to make but something that's a immutable characteristic like your height I think
(5:22:56) those are things that you didn't necessarily you didn't choose those you were born like that so if you want
(5:23:01) somebody who's taller than you I think that's so your argument is it's better to reject people because of things that
(5:23:08) are out of their control versus things that are in their control no the opposite I think it's valid you just said you said valid to not date a guy
(5:23:15) because of his height not valid if a guy doesn't want to date a woman because she's slept with a 100 men no I was
(5:23:21) saying the exact opposite I think no that's exactly what you're saying no I was saying that if somebody wants somebody's height things that they can't
(5:23:27) change those aren't choices that you let me ref let me hold on you confus me by saying that I don't I don't agree with
(5:23:33) that I'm not saying that I think that there's a major difference between somebody who has a high level of sexual
(5:23:39) partners that situation than there is between somebody being funny here let me change it then fine I'll move it off of
(5:23:45) immutable characteristics so um a man who how about this would you disagree
(5:23:52) with me that there are plenty of broke women who would love to date a billionaire no I don't disagree at all
(5:23:58) and I think that's okay hold on but is that a is that hypocritical for the woman who's broke
() 
(5:24:04) to find rich men attractive not attractive but to only want them because of the value of the financial value I do
(5:24:10) think that's incredibly hypocritical they made poor financial choices their entire life and then just expecting them
(5:24:16) man to take care of them because they're lazy and they don't work then that's not I don't think that would make them
(5:24:23) hypocritical that's not how's that hypocrisy understand that because a person who made poor financial choices
(5:24:29) their whole life and then is expecting somebody who made good Financial choices well I don't know if hypocritical would
(5:24:35) be the right word but I don't think that's valid like I don't think it would be fair for somebody who was dirt broke living on the side of the street to
(5:24:41) think that they were a perfect they deserve somebody they deserve
(5:24:46) somebody I want a commitment from you tonight on the show unless you're
(5:24:51) willing to just be a hypocrite you are from here on out you're only allowed to
(5:24:57) date a man who makes the exact same amount of money as you you you can't go
(5:25:02) above you can't go above otherwise you're a hypocrite why can't I go above I hold on you can't go yeah because
(5:25:09) because because if you go $10 above right let's just say you only went $10
(5:25:14) above you're only going to dat to man toate $10 more than you made right then if we extend that out what would
(5:25:20) actually be the problem with a poor woman right going after a rich man there wouldn't be any problem right you're
(5:25:26) just all you're doing is just it's just a matter of degrees at that point would you date the bilon yes would you date a
(5:25:32) billionaire probably that's really hypocritical of you you're not a billionaire you don't know what my bank account looks like I'm not a billion but
(5:25:38) I am reverse you're not a billionaire I'm not a billionaire I would love to be a billionaire but I am thank God very
(5:25:46) financially literate I I'm a hustler and I love to work so I can I can expect
(5:25:52) that from my partner as well right can I have some cash I can do some charity work go get is it is it nonprofit
(5:25:59) deductible what charity are you well you know I'm I'm going through some legal things so if you want to like you know
(5:26:05) help out big he's saying he wants a sugar mama you
(5:26:11) want a sugar mama I I brought you out here hustle you have your money I I mean I've been a sugar mama to my boyfriend
(5:26:17) before so I can just expect the same thing back I think that somebody who makes certain choices in life in this in
(5:26:23) a sense it lines with their values and so get your C for somebody who makes good financial
(5:26:31) decisions I think they can learn from somebody who is even better or more successful than them in the same way
(5:26:36) where let's say I have an aspiration sorry to be a comedian my ex-boyfriend
(5:26:41) was actually a comedian maybe he made me funnier things like that can I ask you a question did you play any sports in school or anything I did uh like but did
(5:26:48) you ever play at the professional level or in college no no well I I don't know if college is professional but um would
(5:26:54) you would you date a professional athlete I would it's a trick question because it's
(5:27:01) not a trick question think for the just the job title of it like somebody who was a professional athlete because
(5:27:08) passion yes but I know that people in spotlights athletes things of that are in Worlds where there's a lot of
(5:27:15) Temptation I don't think it's like dating a DJ to me I don't think that would perfectly align with he'll be loyal he'll never it wouldn't be ideal
(5:27:21) for me I would rather somebody a little bit more behind the scenes or at least Less in a major thing where they're
(5:27:27) flying across the world with their team and all that stuff that's just a personal preference of mine but like I would I think it's important for my
(5:27:33) partner to be athletic or a better example for you Brian health I am obsessed with work working out cold
(5:27:38) plunging Wellness everything about that living a very healthy lifestyle I would never marry somebody or even date
(5:27:43) somebody who did not Value Health that is a huge important value to me and whether they were extremely overweight
(5:27:49) or just really unhealthy um that's a huge turnoff to me and that's something that it's a choice but it's also gu for
(5:27:57) me I guess the point I'm trying to make is that when it comes back to like this hypocrisy thing so I don't think there's
(5:28:04) anything wrong with a man who has a high high body count who wants to date a woman with a low body count or a virgin
(5:28:11) simply because one I think there's asymmetry between what men and women want and then secondly it's just look
(5:28:17) women all the time chase after men who possess a myriad of traits behaviors
(5:28:25) perhaps they have a you know they've accured certain things in their life whether material or otherwise that they
(5:28:30) themselves do not possess I don't think that makes women Hypocrites I don't think it makes men Hypocrites when they
(5:28:36) do the same thing yeah and I think I think people get actually confused about what hypocrisy means so hypocrisy is not
(5:28:43) saying I have no money but want to date a person with money it's saying I have no money and want to date a person with
(5:28:49) money but you who has no money should not try to date a person with money that would be hypocrisy so so people get this
(5:28:57) really very skewed idea of what being hypocritical even is it's uh I I don't understand that either but they they
(5:29:03) seem to so yeah it's not hypocrisy to say I have a high body count want a person with a low body count it would be
(5:29:09) hypocrisy to say but you as a person with a high body count should not want a person with a low body count that would
(5:29:14) then be what would make it hypocracy
(5:29:26) w any push back by the way just like how women you guys think women lose value what do they actually teach you guys in
(5:29:32) college I'd like to know like what how what do they what like what do they teach in college
(5:29:39) I I'm starting college group of women for him to put down I really I don't I don't like that I didn't put down women
(5:29:46) I put down colleges but he put down the colle just starting College I canot say but the
(5:29:54) girls who got their degrees they can probably answer that question better why like every time there's any
(5:29:59) any push back to anything that means Andrew hates women like just stop with the feminism you're such a hater Andrew
(5:30:05) such a hater okay Andrew always says even if it was a man he would say the same thing but I don't see any men in
(5:30:11) these chairs but just how like you guys think women but you will often if you go to podcast and watch me debate them in
(5:30:18) the studio which I do all the time I've actually never seen any of those videos you should go watch them they're quite
(5:30:24) good I should actually you should become a fan of the whatever think there's more successful people in college or more
(5:30:30) successful people that didn't go to college it even break I think uh
(5:30:36) okay you dis agree with adult age Gap relationships example a 30-year-old dating a
(5:30:42) 19-year-old Cali you disagree wait I'm sorry Amelia disagree a 30-year-old
(5:30:48) dating 19-year-old yeah Emily disagree with age Gap Tanya you disagree with age Gap
(5:30:57) relationships any 30-year-old looking to have a relationship with a 19-year-old D just weird why because she's super young
() 
(5:31:03) and you just want to take advantage of her really because she has no life experiences to um
(5:31:08) conduct herself in that relationship if you're doing something wrong to her she do think it's normal her brain isn't done developing why do you want her
(5:31:14) that's weird she's like a little kid still you mean she's in okay so should uh 18-year-old women not be allowed to
(5:31:23) vote I mean if they weren't allowed then why is that a law when you're 18 you're able to vote well why is it a law that
(5:31:30) the age of consent is 18 so they can they can have a consensual relationship 30-year-olds have more experience
(5:31:36) obviously in the dating world and old like that me for example I did a 20-year- old I shouldn't really when I
(5:31:42) was 17 because I didn't have life experiences or anything to like say oh this is wrong what he's doing to me
(5:31:47) talking about adult relationships here okay well that's what I'm saying like a 19-year-old wouldn't know how to be with
(5:31:53) an adult like that or what do you mean I don't know I feel like she' be too young she wouldn't know how to conduct herself really you said take advantage of I mean
(5:32:00) like of her mindset because she's you don't think a 20-year-old could take advantage of another
(5:32:06) 20-year-old yeah sorry to interrupt it was great being on with all you guys I have to leave you knew I had a heart out I stayed almost
(5:32:13) an hour before this I literally wrote you a note and I texted you about it before the show I have a 2our plus drive
(5:32:18) back to LA alone in the dark it was great being on with you follow me on Instagram the de Lea thanks everybody it
(5:32:23) was beautiful having you Brian would never heard a fly never oh thank you thank you Deborah
(5:32:28) appreciate it thank you for coming have a good night get home safely love it was nice meeting you nice to meet you de
(5:32:35) have a good day all right yep uh so anyways uh so I guess uh
(5:32:42) what's your position kind of um my position is it seems that man wants an
(5:32:49) apprentice he doesn't want an equal or a partner do women want equals to be equal
(5:32:56) yes you just heard a table full of women saying they don't want to pay for First Dates they don't want to take any initiative they don't just the first dat
(5:33:03) after that they 50/50 in the relationship like just the let's from other Emily what's your objection to uh
(5:33:09) age Gap relationships um did I put like a little swivel on that one maybe you underlined
(5:33:16) it I mean yeah I think just like within reasonable range 30 to 19 yeah no I
(5:33:21) think like too much of a discrepancy in maturity level makes that an issue but there are some really mature like 20y
(5:33:29) olds you know people are mothers at that young age they've experienced different levels of life than maybe another
(5:33:35) 20-year-old so it just depends on ick um a little it depends on how they met I
(5:33:41) guess if it's kind of like it seems like they're praying or grooming them then yeah that's a problem but in what way
(5:33:46) would they be praying like what is what does that mean to pray like oh waiting until they turn 18 or 19 or a reasonable
(5:33:53) let's assume they met when uh this woman was already an
(5:33:58) adult so there's not like yeah it's genuine genuine connection genuine
(5:34:04) experience getting to know each other then yeah sure okay and then you dis dis agreed why do you disagree I mean I was
(5:34:10) with someone that was 12 years older for 9 years but yeah to each had their own
(5:34:15) like JayZ Beyonce or 12 years apart it works sometimes now do you want to just scoot into the table maybe permanently
(5:34:22) so you can be on the microphone and yeah I don't have to remind you for the 30th time but okay yeah 19 I think is a
(5:34:28) little young for someone being 30 something okay all right um it gives you the ick yeah okay
(5:34:38) all right um can you guys actually make a compelling like argument why it's
(5:34:46) wrong I did uh I mean I think because
(5:34:52) her brain isn't then developing um I think obviously he's choosing someone who's a lot younger and
(5:35:00) more inexperience and has also just come out of high school so ew like you know
(5:35:06) you as a 30 old man why are you dating someone who just came out of a high school like is that you know um you
(5:35:13) can't get better like well I mean you don't want someone who's going to challenge you you don't want someone who
(5:35:19) who what would be better I don't want I don't want somebody to challenge mature mature yeah it's more mature what do you
(5:35:25) mean more mature mentally more mature once you want to date if you're 30 years old why won you date a woman that's
(5:35:30) actually like mentally mature than a girl that's 19 not a woman who is UN mentally immature well she is I met some
(5:35:37) 19 are pretty damn mentally mature I mean well going to like my situation I was 17 I wasn't mature yet and I let him
(5:35:43) take full advantage of me so and I thought it was perfectly fine how old was he when 20 when you met yeah he was
(5:35:49) 20 and I was 17 two months before I turned 18 and yeah but I mean if he was 18 wait there two months before you
(5:35:55) turned 18 how long did you do him since 20198 and I broke up with him this year
() 
(5:36:02) what wait is this the yeah the same guy six year I only been him one year like Ser like not one year
(5:36:08) so wait two months into the relationship you were 18 and then he was still 20 mhm
(5:36:14) that's not much of an age Gap no it's not but he was more mature though than I was obviously cuz he had been through
(5:36:21) more relationships and I haven't so I mean is it would it be that weird though for an 18-year-old to be dating a 20 I
(5:36:28) don't think that's weird 22 or a 21y old in this case I was like 18 to 21 I'm
(5:36:35) saying the M was more mature than I was I don't think we would consider that an age
(5:36:41) Gap talking 10 years is like yeah 10 years a little bit like a little bit too
(5:36:46) much 5 years is fine mhm saying I was immature at 17 so I can
(5:36:54) imagine like a 19-year-old not being that mature for um compared to a 30-year-old does that make sense or am I
(5:36:59) wrong or you think a 19-year-old has has the same maturity levels as a 30-year-old man well I'm I'm not sure
(5:37:05) that people are looking for relationship based around various maturity levels like um I think that people have pequ
(5:37:13) very different interests and I see men who are 30 with very immature women who are 35 and I see women who are 30 with
(5:37:19) very immature men both are 25 right so the thing is is like I'm not sure that you can just say well you're an adult
(5:37:27) and because of this we're just going to make this kind of like bracket where even though you're an adult we're just
(5:37:32) going to assume that you're too stupid to make the decision as to who you want to date that just kind of seems absurd to me
(5:37:39) would you be okay if it was your daughter one of would you be so I wouldn't be okay with my daughter dating
(5:37:45) anybody ever uh and no father ever is so it doesn't really matter if there was an
(5:37:50) age Gap or not all fathers hate all boys who date their daughters so I'm not
(5:37:56) really sure how that's particularly relatable I wouldn't care if she was with or dating a guy 20 years older I
(5:38:02) would hate him or if she was dating a guy who was around her same age I would hate that guy too so fair
(5:38:08) okay okay all right really quick I guess on this um I guess even kind of granting
(5:38:15) your your guys's positions that maybe it's like icky or whatever predatory or whatever it's um take advantage of
(5:38:22) whatever um if you were trying to like convince men to date women their age
(5:38:29) like aside from like if you have to P put away like the shaming and that sort of uh stuff can you actually like make
(5:38:38) an argument for like why like what are the benefits of dating an older
(5:38:44) woman she has her [ __ ] together and you don't have to really like provide for her like you would do for like a younger
(5:38:49) person who doesn't have their stuff together when you're 30 if you're still single is the guy going to have to provide for you no cuz you should she
(5:38:54) should already be um able to provide for GU need to Pro really yeah I I hope when
(5:39:00) I'm 30d and will to provide for myself and have to rely on a man okay yeah but if it's a provider argument then this
(5:39:05) one's um I I guess the counter to that that I would give would be uh I think
(5:39:10) yes you would have to provide for the 18-year-old or 19-year-old or even 20-year- old if you're a man in their
(5:39:16) 30s uh but they would have significantly less baggage and so it might actually be
(5:39:21) more inexpensive to provide for that person with less baggage than the woman in her 30s with more baggage might be
(5:39:27) far less expensive she might for uh for instance the accrual of debt that a
(5:39:32) woman would have in her 30s versus at at 1819 you would have to admit the chances
(5:39:38) are going to be way higher that she has aced a lot of debt by the time she's 30 that is true so for financial reason I'm
(5:39:45) I'm not sure that like the financial argument is the best one I think you're right that the woman would be able to
(5:39:51) provide a better standard of life for herself perhaps but that doesn't mean that she would necessarily be less
(5:39:56) expensive for the man that is true
(5:40:02) yeah like I look for a provider I don't know if Brian walked out or not yeah like I look for a provider but also know
(5:40:08) like I would like to be a provider myself too I'm just not I'm not relying solely on the man to take care of me
(5:40:13) 24/7 yeah but I mean would you be opposed to it no I I wouldn't either if it comes natural natural you wouldn't be
(5:40:18) opposed to it either so the idea here is that I think there's also 18 19 20y old girls who would like to be provided for
(5:40:25) as well and I think that um the type of men who can provide for them generally going to be established and probably in
(5:40:31) their 30s so give like here I can give you a good idea of this uh women's uh
(5:40:37) reproductive years generally they're like Prime reproductive years somewhere around 18 years old to let's say 26 27
(5:40:45) right it's kind of the the prime it's not that they can't have babies fast that they can I'm just saying it's easier on their bodies the labor is less
(5:40:52) intense the babies are generally a bit healthier you know bounce back faster yeah yeah you bounce back from it faster
(5:40:59) because you're younger right your body can take it and heal quicker if that is the case if if a woman is expected to
(5:41:05) have babies in those years it seems reasonable to me that a woman would expect to be provided for in those years
(5:41:12) and younger men are going to have a harder time doing that than men in their 30s for instance so wouldn't it make sense if women sexually selected for men
(5:41:19) in their 30s if they wanted to have children yeah I see your point of view
(5:41:24) there I mean that makes that makes total sense to me it's like okay now now your reproductive years you're taking care of
(5:41:30) men around my own age bracket can't do that but you can that actually makes sense to me it does as well to me
(5:41:38) yeah so that I mean I guess um you know I guess there's really no argument there
(5:41:43) Cher one what do you think you were giving me that look like you were G you were giving me the look come on what
(5:41:49) what is it what well I mean it was it was over the argument about debt I mean
(5:41:55) in the state of California when you marry someone you don't acrew their debt you only acrew you know half the amount
(5:42:01) of their debt that you acred during the marriage believe me I know this so I just didn't really see that as a valid
(5:42:06) AR as like oh you should wait wait their credit you're going to well you would still have to deal with it right so
(5:42:12) you're still going to have to deal with whatever their credit is you're going to have to deal with uh if they and if by
(5:42:17) the way if they have debt I think it's reasonable inide of marriages generally debt is shared even if technically the
(5:42:23) law says it's not like in the state of California in this instance I think that most people put away for their
(5:42:29) retirement together if you're putting away for the retirement together why wouldn't you be sharing the debt I mean
(5:42:35) it it that does seem to be the case at most people shared Deb right yeah I mean it's just not what I experienced
(5:42:42) personally so um yeah but I mean if you were in a if you had another husband tomorrow let's say and you had $50,000
(5:42:49) in debt and he had $225,000 in debt wouldn't you guys probably work to pay each other's debt
(5:42:55) off I mean yeah that would be a priority yeah that would be a PR exactly so I
(5:43:01) mean it it it makes sense to me that if you had more debt in your 30s that that
(5:43:07) that wouldn't necessarily make you more financially viable to a man who could who could financially support you than
(5:43:13) if you were younger just because you are in a position where you can make money doesn't mean you don't come with a lot of acrw
(5:43:19) debt yeah I understand what you're saying yeah just going back oh did you
(5:43:24) have some were you raising your hand uh okay I guess I'd still like to hear like
(5:43:29) a com like what what's the benefit to the man for dating an older woman because the reality is when it comes to
(5:43:35) dating we're all uh what What's the word we're all um trying to think what the
(5:43:42) greedy we all want the best that we can get we want the most attractive person
(5:43:47) we want the person with the best XY whatever traits you know people have different preferences on that but we're
(5:43:53) all trying to get the very best that we can get so I'm just trying to understand
() 
(5:44:01) like if men are dating younger women because and this does seem to be a trend which would indicate to me that men are
(5:44:07) making some sort of value judgment value assessment that younger women are more attractive whether that comes down to
(5:44:13) their looks personality whatever they're making some value assessment there otherwise this if it wasn't the case you
(5:44:21) know why why if there wasn't some increase in value why why would they they want to
(5:44:28) date these younger women um I guess like can you make an argument as to like why
(5:44:34) should a m dat an older woman aside from just your shame
(5:44:40) tactics I mean so older so you're saying in this situation so the man is the 19-year-old and the woman is old so in
(5:44:47) comparison to a younger woman so oh like someone their why should a 35-year-old date another 35-year-old versus say a
(5:44:54) 25-year-old or a 20-year-old I think so that you can have
(5:44:59) an equal have have an equal yeah you can
(5:45:04) have an equal you have someone who you know can understand like your shared experiences I feel like you guys are at
(5:45:11) the same stage in life someone who's 19 kind of someone who's 19 your age isn't
(5:45:16) I mean sorry your brain isn't done developing so it's like I feel like you don't really know who you are yet you
(5:45:22) can give them children and this and that and maybe you know a couple years from then you're like [ __ ] you know I don't
(5:45:29) know uh well why do we assign those women in adulthood I I don't know the laws are
(5:45:35) put in place by men so can tell me do you think we should wait until they're
(5:45:41) 26 um I mean I think it would be wise to wait for everyone to be you know have
(5:45:49) their brain think we should raise the age of adulthood to 26 I don't think it's a bad idea I mean you have to rent
(5:45:55) you have to wait till you're 24 to rent a car so yeah so like let's say for instance a 28-year-old then was uh
(5:46:03) having sex with a 23-year-old uh you would call him a a PDF file then no I mean like like I said
(5:46:10) I don't think five years that that that's that's the entailment right the entailment is if we the age of consent
(5:46:15) 26 I feel you 26 you can't consent until until you're 26 because you're not an
(5:46:21) adult then you would be saying that if a 28-year-old was banging a 25-year-old he'd be a PDF file that's the actual
(5:46:28) logical entailment of that but when you're 30 aren't you looking for somebody to be like um on a stable relationship and be committed a
(5:46:34) 19-year-old is going to be thinking about going partying and like trying not necessarily sorry for age of consent I
(5:46:39) thought we were talking about voting not I'm sorry sexual children can can children
(5:46:45) consent no okay so if you want to raise the age of adulthood to 26 anything
(5:46:51) under the age of 26 would be considered what
(5:46:57) non-consensual uh child right because they're not ad ad child you're like I
() 
(5:47:03) feel like you're still an ad adult what are you you're an adol I suppose okay so an adolescent um so so
(5:47:12) they wouldn't be able to consent to sex so 25y old all right have sex with a 27-year-old in your worldview of raising
(5:47:20) the adulthood they would actually have penalties and be considered some type of Creeper because they had sex with this
(5:47:28) um not quite an adult at 26 woman doesn't that seem absurd right I mean it
(5:47:33) does that's why I said I feel like a fiveyear gap is fine but 10 years is very strange to me you know like you
(5:47:39) have a Whole Decade on a person that's just weird so how how old are you6 how
(5:47:45) old you say you're 26 so so do you think that we we should consider you if you
(5:47:52) were to have sex with a 25-year-old have you ever had sex with a 25-year-old at 26 no 24 no anybody younger than you no
(5:48:02) male or female no never you've never had sex your whole life with anybody even
(5:48:07) one day younger than you really not that I can remember okay whatever fine but do
(5:48:13) you really think that it's reasonable to say that they're 25 years old you're 26 you had sex with them and they couldn't
(5:48:19) consent because they're of course I think that's fine like I'm saying I think a 5year gap for sex is fine you
(5:48:27) know in that case age of consent I mean then I I would say like you know voting consent um you know 2526 I feel like
(5:48:35) sexual consent can be five years you know past that I would say 20 would be fine so a 35-year-old and a 25-year-old
(5:48:43) having sex that's no bueno straight to jail for that guy I'm not saying straight to jail I'm just saying like it
(5:48:48) gives me the ick that's my opinion oh it gives you the ick okay but I mean what what if somebody was like well it gives
(5:48:53) me the ick if if if anybody around the same age is having sex that gives me the
(5:48:59) ick does is that does that sound reasonable it's like oh that's like having sex with your brother we're all
(5:49:05) tile why I can't do younger younger guys cuz I have a little brother so I cannot
(5:49:11) I have a child I don't want to be someone else's mommy but I also would date a guy 20 year age Gap or maybe like
(5:49:17) a 10 year i' be a little too much for me I'll stick to the 5year age Gap limit We Stand do you think that that
(5:49:23) should be in any way criminalized though no no well then you're making then if it shouldn't be then you're then you are
(5:49:30) saying that they are adults you just you just personally it gives you the ick that's it it's just
(5:49:37) right it's just that from your perspective there's like there you don't actually have a problem with it you just
(5:49:43) it's just dick right I mean I have a problem with it for my own like sense of
(5:49:50) Integrity yeah well how would it violate your integrity because I I just think you
(5:49:56) know obviously the mindset and the values of a 19-year-old and a
(5:50:01) 30-year-old is completely different that's my argument I don't think they're wait I don't know why
(5:50:07) their values would be different like what value difference you want to go party with a 19-year-old every weekend
(5:50:13) like she wants to do or you would want to like to not be going out and be more mature levelheaded oh yeah oh no
(5:50:18) terrible so what you're saying is the guy is like oh you can't go be a [ __ ] and you're like oh my God how could you
(5:50:24) be so controlling like don't you want to go to a nightclub and ride a bunch of dicks Andrew like what's wrong with you
(5:50:31) no it's like that's a mentality of a 19-year-old like to go party and like enjoy her Youth and stuff like that a
(5:50:36) 30-year-old he's over that they've been through that can also I don't understand why is the only way to enjoy your youth
(5:50:42) to go to a nightclub get drunk and [ __ ] dudes like why is that why is not my in when I girl must enjoy her youth like
(5:50:50) isn't that wild yeah the best way for a 19-year-old to enjoy her youth is to go out to parties and give [ __ ] that
(5:50:57) doesn't sound like it's the best most optimal way to enjoy your you
(5:51:05) no it she it it seems to me like okay what if she was like okay I just want to
(5:51:10) be your wife for the rest of my life wait so sorry then lucky so yeah can I
(5:51:15) ask you a question look at you yeah yeah sure go ahead your argument just so I'm
(5:51:21) understanding is that you know it's better practice you think for women
(5:51:28) 19 to what is you say the child raring Prime is 27 to just stay home those
(5:51:35) years and raise kids group right you can argue a couple of years you could argue maybe it's up to 29 or it's as low as 26
(5:51:43) um but I I think that commonly if you were to say between 18 woman's body
(5:51:49) generally speaking uh is completely developed to 26 years old they're going
(5:51:55) to have the easiest time with child rearing child child yeah I think that that's generally the best time I would
(5:52:00) say yeah I mean I I can't argue with that I understand what you're saying
(5:52:05) yeah it was really easy for me like also just I guess last thing on the AG gab
(5:52:11) thing I my own anecdotal experience so I've dated women who are older than me
(5:52:17) I've had age gaps in the opposite direction where I think I was 32 and I dated the I think she's 44 45 I'm
(5:52:27) 35 is there was there a followup or for context serious okay yeah so uh
(5:52:34) when I was 31 I dated a woman who's 45 I had uh I've dated some older other older
(5:52:39) women too I think I maybe not quite as big as that one but like 33 40 something
(5:52:45) like that so um and then I've dated women my own age plus or minus a couple years 19-year-old huh never a
(5:52:52) 19-year-old well so obviously when I when but when I was younger yeah but uh
(5:52:58) yeah no I've dated uh I've dated uh in my 30s I have dated how
(5:53:04) about you dat 19-year-old then you come and tell us how how it went I I have okay I have I've dated younger
(5:53:10) women kind of around the Spectrum you know the Spectrum so my own anecdotal
(5:53:16) experience on this is Trope that women between the ages of 18 and 25 that they're like immature retards without a
(5:53:23) fully developed brain is one insulting to young women and and two just not true from a my own anecdotal experience um I
(5:53:31) think there's idiots at all ages there's people that you'll have a terrible time with at any single age and I just it
(5:53:40) does not make sense to me like no matter what dating is difficult you're going to
(5:53:46) encounter like a ton of people that just are not a match for you at any age my viewpoint on this if you're like most
(5:53:52) men here's the reality we care a lot about looks younger women are typically going to be better looking if you can
(5:53:59) get a younger like a younger woman why not I don't see what the
() 
(5:54:04) actual objection and like I also think also sorry just one sec one sec and so I
(5:54:13) mean it's it's like and also I mean I'm not trying to come off
(5:54:19) as superficial but like there's plenty of really cool put together younger
(5:54:24) women like me for examp in their early 20s and just because they're young
(5:54:29) doesn't mean that they're pieces of [ __ ] or they're going to treat you poorly in fact I find the opposite to typically be
(5:54:35) true is that they tend to be better Partners they're more pleasant they have
(5:54:41) less uh trauma they have less baggage they have a lower body count they're more physically like it's just
(5:54:47) like how dare these men want to date women who are more physically attractive
(5:54:52) and have less relationship baggage and tend to be more pleasant individual like I I just don't really understand the
(5:55:00) this argument at all um and uh can you explain the loaded there's also Brian
(5:55:07) I've noticed this I I wanted to get your take on this for a while sure what is with the loaded sexual language around
(5:55:14) it like why do you want a woman who's freshly 18 right teen freshly 18
(5:55:20) teenager a teenager freshly 18 but it's sexually loaded almost like spoiled
(5:55:25) that's what's so funny about it right like it's uh like it's something which has been uh spoiled if you go in you go
(5:55:31) oh well they're fresh fresh meaning like uh you know like like how is fresh right
(5:55:37) you all everyone wants the fresh fruit nobody wants the rotten fruit but the idea almost here is that oh you want
(5:55:43) them fresh when they're when they're 18 and fr it's like well wouldn't you
(5:55:49) wouldn't you want them before they were spoiled so it's like to me it seems like the language actually plays in your
(5:55:54) favor when women say that like fresh you know and in freshly at it's like well yeah what do you want to you want have
(5:56:00) spoiled at 25 then if they're only fresh at 18 I don't get it yeah I mean it is an interesting component I mean you
(5:56:06) brought up the high school example but it's like I think to myself okay well what if there's like some really dumb
(5:56:12) 25-year-old for some reason still in high school I don't think the like I don't think it's so much the objection
(5:56:19) as the high school component it's the age at the end of the day um but there
(5:56:24) is like a lot of shaming language they'll often say like uh teenager
(5:56:30) and someone can be 13 and a te teenager and 19 and
(5:56:36) 24 hours away from turning uh 20 and they're still a teenager it's just it's
(5:56:41) it is sort of this loaded language to try to like the spin to try to frame it in the most unflattering light as
(5:56:48) possible trying to make you look like a PDF is what it's trying essentially yeah essentially trying to make men look like
(5:56:53) they're PDFs because they're attracted to women who are younger who are in their childbearing re but but the
(5:56:59) counter to this that I've heard and it is compelling to me but I never make this argument because even though it's
(5:57:05) compelling to me I can't prove it right and usually I only like to make arguments I can prove but I will say
(5:57:11) that the argument that I've heard that it's mostly women who are older are actually jealous as [ __ ] of younger
(5:57:17) women being able to get the men in their age bracket that they actually desire is
(5:57:22) the main motivation for why they're against age Gap relationships I have never I don't know how to demonstrate
(5:57:29) that logically so I don't make the argument but it is compelling to me so I wonder what you thought about
(5:57:34) that I mean I saw a lot of you or I saw a lot of women shaking their nodding their heads right you guys agree with
(5:57:40) that or disagree I mean a lot of older women tend to be jealous of younger women in
(5:57:45) their youth yeah and the attention they get so I mean that's you're not wrong I think it's an interesting argument just
(5:57:52) never thought about it yeah never articulated I do think uh one I guess one thing on this Andrew that that is
(5:57:58) interesting to me is that I think there like men's attraction for this is not
(5:58:04) like even really fully up to them in so far as like attraction is typically not
(5:58:12) like a a choice and what I mean by that is like there's just like sort of
(5:58:18) biological base biological evolutionary things that uh people find attractive
(5:58:26) and so like for example I wouldn't um you can make similar arguments about like women like wanting to date rich men
(5:58:33) but like this has a evolutionary biological basis is women like a man who has resources can provide for you and
(5:58:40) your children That's the basis for why women will find men with like status or
(5:58:45) who are who are wealthy they'll find this it's not the only thing that you'll care about but it'll be like something
(5:58:51) that'll make you more attracted to a guy and this is just rooted in women's own Evolution or EV like their own
(5:58:58) biology you are attracted to men who are capable of providing for you who have resources and in the same way men men
(5:59:08) who are attracted to young adult women that is also based in biology
(5:59:14) comes down to fertility yeah make I mean it makes sense but the the question the question
(5:59:20) I have too on the kind of jealy front May man get your takes on this right the
(5:59:25) the idea here just being uh because Brian brought up control and I and I like to think of it from this the same
(5:59:31) aspect is that well it's outside of your control now right so uh um if if men
(5:59:37) around your your age bracket who have the resources that you desire you want to be with them based on let's say those
(5:59:44) particulars I don't think that men generally give a [ __ ] that much about women's interests I know that women
(5:59:49) bring this up all the time like what do you have in common with an 18-year-old it's like what do I have in common with a
(5:59:54) 35-year-old what the hell do I have in common with a 35-year-old woman they don't want to do [ __ ] anything I want
(5:59:59) to do they don't want to go out you know what I like to do I like to go out in the forest with a 357 and just randomly
(6:00:06) shoot rabbits because I think it's fun they pop they pop their head like a zit I'm just like Bam Bam and they just like
() 
(6:00:13) Drop right women aren't into they don't care right now A buddy of mine might show up and he'd be like oh yeah let's
(6:00:19) do the walk man let's do the whole the whole genericide Forest Package we're just going to kill everything that walks out there they're fine with it right
(6:00:26) they don't care what do I have in common with with a woman in my age bracket
(6:00:31) exactly what like what is the thing I'm supposed to have in common with her that I don't have in common with a
(6:00:37) 19-year-old uh woman I I'd actually like to know the answer to that follow up on that Andrew though that that's a great
(6:00:43) question does anybody I I don't know if we heard it tonight though did anybody have the commonality argument like what
(6:00:50) do you have in common what is a 30-year-old have in common with a 19-year-old right I think like shared
(6:00:56) experiences with like the way you guys grew up you know growing up before internet dating was a thing sometimes
(6:01:02) younger girls might have a different outlook on relationships cuz of how we grew up we won't know the same type of
(6:01:08) music y'all listen to or you know it's just different areas like they don't listen to the same [ __ ]
(6:01:15) I listen to now like I'm listening I'm listening to like 80s metal hairband right driving down the street you got
(6:01:21) you know metallic blasting Guns and Roses they don't want to hear that [ __ ] right they don't want to hear that [ __ ]
(6:01:27) at my age so I was like what exactly is what are what are these interests exactly that women in my age
(6:01:36) or supposed to have with me that a woman at 1819 doesn't have I'd actually like to know this like what are the interests
(6:01:42) here I think maybe when they're younger they're kind of worried about figuring
(6:01:47) themselves and like their lives out whereas when you're older you kind of have your life already figured out and
(6:01:54) it's like you have space to take in a partner when you're young you're kind of figuring yourself not really answering
(6:01:59) this question though yeah but what about my question what is it what what are the interests I'm supposed to share with 354
(6:02:06) year old women that I wouldn't share with 18 or 19y old like what are the actual interests cuz when I think about
(6:02:11) it the more I think about it the more I realize uh me and my wife basically have no [ __ ] interests which are similar
(6:02:18) okay basically zero interests that are that similar the only thing I I would say is like she likes to shoot guns
(6:02:25) that's about it right Prett bad but really but really like she's interested in doing nails and Sh I don't give a
(6:02:31) [ __ ] about that she's interested in almost everything in fact she's interested in I literally don't give a [ __ ] about it
(6:02:38) so it's like so so what are the things that a 19-year-old I'm supposed to not have interest in when they don't have
(6:02:45) the interest they have at 40 I don't get it um yeah like I mean at my younger age
(6:02:51) I'm not like worried about settling down and having a family but maybe an older woman would be open to having a family
(6:02:57) and settling down when you're younger maybe you're more in shape to be partying and clubbing and spending your
(6:03:04) days out with friends all night and when you're older like trust me there's plent
(6:03:10) but you would agree with me that young women could definitely many young women have an interest in having a family
(6:03:16) there's many young women who are interested in starting them young so that could be something that we share as far as a desire we both have but what
(6:03:24) but when I'm talking about commonality of interests like what what are we supp we don't listen to same music right none
(6:03:30) of the activities we do are similar that we find to be relaxing or fun except maybe watching TV but I assume a
(6:03:36) 19-year-old girl probably likes to watch TV also right so it's like so so what are these things like what are these
(6:03:42) commonalities exactly that men are supposed to be sharing with women because uh like men like to grab in in
(6:03:50) the game Red Dead Redemption 2 they like to grab random uh you know like women on
(6:03:55) the street and throw them on the back of the horse and drive down to the railroad tracks and throw the chick on the railroad just to watch the train hit her
(6:04:01) in the video game women don't like to do that [ __ ] now men like to do that at 20 they like to do that at 40 they like to
(6:04:08) do it at 60 it's like what is what are these commonalities
(6:04:13) exactly I thought you here how about Andrew what do you about what do you think about this one though related to your question
(6:04:21) Andrew if I'm dating a girl who is my exact same age but we have nothing in
(6:04:27) common is that gross too like why would you date someone you
(6:04:33) don't have anything in common with do you think I mean I think it's for basically so let me let me okay when it
(6:04:40) let's just say there's a man and a woman and they they have the exact same birth date same
(6:04:46) age what do they have in common that would be sufficient enough for you to be like whoa we have so much in common I
(6:04:54) want to [ __ ] you said nobody ever go ahead give me
(6:05:01) something well what it mostly boils down to for me is maturity that's my only argument I feel like so then wouldn't
(6:05:08) you be with an old so in common yeah like I as a is different
(6:05:17) from growing up Asen baby like what what do you I mean I
(6:05:22) guess I understand your movie references so like what if I dated somebody with like a different nationality that was
(6:05:29) pretty funny what what if I dated somebody who's like a different nationality we
(6:05:34) have way I would argue we have way less in common than like a 10year age Gap
(6:05:41) yeah I think variety is a spice of life so I see your argument here like I am I
(6:05:47) not allowed yeah I'm I'm a predator for wanting to date like a like a Latin
(6:05:53) American woman no because we have nothing in common I don't who's my exact same age because we have nothing in
(6:06:01) common I don't know I've met a lot of men that marry Colombian women and they can't speak the same language and they
(6:06:06) don't know their C don't care yeah yeah they they don't have they don't have anything like the thing is the more the
(6:06:11) more you think about it the more just want attractive women that's it that's all they care about hang on I think that's reducible
(6:06:19) the same way as it is to say well wait uh women only want men with big wallets
(6:06:24) right and it's like I don't I don't think that that's the case I think that that yes attractiveness for men is like
(6:06:31) the primary goal and perhaps resources for women primary goal I think that those are things they value perhaps
(6:06:37) higher than other things but they still value other things I'm just saying the more I think about it with couples
(6:06:43) basically almost any male Fe female couple I've ever met in my life don't [ __ ] have anything in common at all
(6:06:50) like they really don't have that much in common there's a few of them who do perhaps have more things in common than
(6:06:55) others but ultimately they don't really have that much in common yeah they don't like to watch the same shows they don't
() 
(6:07:01) like to you know they don't they don't they really don't so this argument I've never gotten it really that's
(6:07:08) interesting yeah it's uh it is uh so you're saying
(6:07:13) compatibility is not even based upon mutual interest well this is kind of the Y yin and yang never thought so I've
(6:07:19) never thought it was like if wouldn't it be like you might as well just be gay like if commonality like if if we are if
(6:07:27) the the the ultimate thing that we're like trying to like that that fuels sexual attraction or relationship
(6:07:34) attraction everyone would just be gay you just date your same sex same penis
(6:07:40) double penis yeah you have you know man he's got a beard you've got a beard you
(6:07:45) like traits and the partner that you're not right yeah there's like different you know anyways sometimes sometimes
(6:07:51) maybe you like traits that they have like maybe you're a tall guy who really wants a tall woman that'd be a trait you
(6:07:56) have in common but like when it comes to the commonality specifically in interest yeah right other than religion I just
(6:08:03) don't see much I just really I don't don't really see cuz totally interested in very different things yeah different
(6:08:09) music different favorite colors different foods I mean I hardly ever
(6:08:14) meet people who them and their partner are same same
(6:08:20) everything um let's see here um uh we're going to move on to the next
(6:08:25) thing we do have a chat here that's Ana can I have you read this one question for the panel if a man
(6:08:32) comes up to you and puts you into a conundrum by asking can I tell you something explicit does he have a 75%
(6:08:41) chance of getting with you yeah so here's the scenario I'll paint this scenario for you guy walks
(6:08:46) over to you in a club and he says hey baby can I tell you something explicit and then you say yes and then
() 
(6:08:53) he hits you with a logic bomb which puts you in a conundrum does that mean he has a 75% chance of sleeping with
(6:09:00) you no no I I didn't think it did m
(6:09:06) uh we we're not going to linger too long on these two but a lot of you disagreed
(6:09:11) men are not insecure controlling for wanting their partner to not go to bars clubs Etc and then also not wanting
(6:09:18) their partner to dress less revealingly um a lot of you
(6:09:23) disagreed um we kind of talked a little bit about it earlier just show of hands
(6:09:29) who disagreed on those I think Emily you
(6:09:37) disagreed uh okay um actually I'm just going to skip over that one just for the
(6:09:43) sake of time uh why don't we move to let me just
(6:09:48) see uh Amelia hold on one sec
(6:09:59) guys Amelia I you disagreed sorry guys figuring out the note [ __ ] here uh you
(6:10:07) disagree I said in this women have equal rights to men you
(6:10:12) disagree um that women have equal rights to men yeah well women do have some equal
(6:10:19) rights like towards men were able to vote right we're able to um work if we want to it's not suppressed like we it
(6:10:26) used to be like back in like the 50s or the 40s where women we only having to be at home and be stay home moms and like
(6:10:33) now we have freedom to do what we want mhm and so yeah that's what I disagree on but so okay
(6:10:40) um we have the same rights as men now as before we did not right so but the it
(6:10:46) was women have equal rights to men you disagree oh I me I agree then
(6:10:52) sorry okay um moving on then once Callie's back here I guess I'll get into

(6:14:09) Instagram all you had to do to did you look into the show at all because the
(6:14:14) length of the show you literally just have to go to the YouTube channel and you would have figured that out that's on you look I we have a third party
(6:14:21) who's handling some guest bookings I would have to ask her what she told you I don't have that in front of me I don't
(6:14:28) know what she told you in any case you guys were an hour late I don't know what to tell you um on
(6:14:35) anything hour late I started when the started we try to go live at 5:00 p.m.

(6:16:10) out she did she provide you the did Kelly provide you the link to the podcast I
(6:16:19) didn't have the messages I don't have to lie then you should have checked out the channel and figured it out then I don't
(6:16:25) know what to tell you I at the Instagram I didn't at the I didn't know that never heard okay well I guess you can leave

(6:30:01) we not disagree that women are not but are currently yeah women are not
(6:30:06) oppressed who disagrees they were they're not anymore I don't think mhm is that good
(6:30:14) statement the what that women were oppressed before but now they're not as not as oppressed like they were before
() 
(6:30:21) so I'm tired now nobody like half of you literally
(6:30:27) circled that nobody's going to okay you you circled it I mean um I
(6:30:37) wanted to talk about you know um you know women and men having equal rights I
(6:30:43) mean I don't think that's true um because you know
(6:30:49) women's reproductive rights in certain States um you know uh are under you know
(6:30:59) law by men but there's no Reproductive Rights against men men for vasectomies
(6:31:05) you know and not being able to get procedures like that so there's no reproduct there's no law against women
(6:31:11) getting their tubes tied yeah I'm sorry that was a bad argument why is there birth control for women but there's no
(6:31:17) birth control for men yeah I guess that's that's argument I me I'm sorry I'm tired Y is there there is birth
(6:31:23) control from then yeah there's is there is watching Star
(6:31:28) Wars actually the the pill form of birth control for men's been available uh for years it's just that pharmaceutical
(6:31:35) companies don't want to release it how does that even work for men why all it
(6:31:40) well it it destroys the sperm and the semen that's what it does or it blocks it I'm not sure scientifically how it
(6:31:46) works but there is actually a pill for men that's way safer than the pill for women because the pill that you have to
(6:31:53) take unfortunately has all sorts of hormone problems than the pill that men could take does not but it's not readily
(6:32:00) available for men isn't that strange that is it's kind of weird Okay so is there
(6:32:07) anything else you can think of besides like uh reprod women have equal rights yes no I
(6:32:16) don't I don't okay what right so what right does a man have that a woman doesn't um I mean men are stripping away
(6:32:22) you know women's reproductive rights in certain States not California but Texas
(6:32:28) I forget the other states you know it's like illegal to get an abortion that's pretty scary what what but so men don't
() 
(6:32:34) have a right to abortion so how would that be a right that a man has that a woman doesn't I mean it's just equality
(6:32:44) it's inequality how wouldn't it men can't have abortions though so yeah so like wouldn't this actually wouldn't the
(6:32:50) true equality be abortion is just Nationwide ban that
(6:32:56) would actually be equality wouldn't it yeah I understand so you're in favor of equality
(6:33:04) I mean I'm in favor of equality for sure so you're in favor of a nationwide abortion ban no that's not what I'm
(6:33:11) saying so you're not in favor of equality no I'm pro-choice but you said it you said it would be
(6:33:17) equality right I'm tired okay clearly yeah sorry
(6:33:24) so I don't really think I can debate this topic very much cuz my argument was bad and I I don't really understand how
(6:33:30) to structure it right now so right let's just put aside the abortion thing anything else no okay all right and then
(6:33:38) um I'm trying to see here if there's women should be
(6:33:44) drafted Gina disagrees Amelia disagrees if we were to get drafted I don't feel
(6:33:49) like you know like Andrew said women wouldn't be as useful we get this killed in the front line easily okay compared
(6:33:55) to men don't women go in the military like that is so strong actually we
(6:34:01) strong but compared to men we not strong that's I'm trying to say that's true that is true biologically men are
(6:34:07) stronger than women or am I wrong yeah that's well that's not the that's not the primary reason maybe Ronda Rousey
(6:34:14) can be more um stronger than a man you know who knows mhm well I mean you're
(6:34:20) you're right you are correct I mean of course generally men are stronger than women I don't think anybody's going to dispute that but main reason that you
(6:34:26) don't want women in combat roles in the military is because the enemy will saay them and that's highly demoralized
(6:34:34) to the men on your side to have the women of your country sent back pregnant
(6:34:39) uh by the enemy that would be highly demoralizing right yeah or if women died in war there' be less women to like give
(6:34:46) birth for the Next Generation as well because it be like wiped out right that's true that's another that's another side effect but the the big
(6:34:52) thing is is like so so men are going to be stronger in Frontline combat there's no doubt about that there's never been a
(6:34:58) female uh Navy Seal for instance for this reason it's because um the the strength requirements just
(6:35:04) are are so different but there's all sorts of other side effects that people don't think about like if you were the
(6:35:10) general of the of the enemy's Army and they were sending women after your troops what would you instruct your army
(6:35:16) to do to them is there women in swat teams or is it just only men very very
(6:35:23) very rarely that women are part of special weapons and tactics groups so that's a SWAT team right special weapons
(6:35:28) and tag is very rare um though I'm sure I'm sure that there's cases and instances where it happen I'm not saying
(6:35:34) that there couldn't be some women who could be great soldiers I wouldn't I wouldn't make that claim I'm knock I'm sure yeah I'm sure that there's some uh
(6:35:41) but I don't I'm not sure why they wouldn't be at the mercy of being Ed by the enemy though you know seems like they still
(6:35:48) would be so yeah yep EAS your target for sure uh just to move things along here
(6:35:54) Emily you're the only person who disagreed with this one it's not straight for a man to date a
(6:36:01) transom then we will say that's queer yeah we I said it was clear too that one
(6:36:06) I guess nobody read the question right I disagree that it is does it say not
(6:36:12) straight holy [ __ ] oh my God reading comprehension
(6:36:17) um so okay what's the question it's not here okay question a man dating a trans
(6:36:24) woman straight or gay gay okay okay all right that was a never mind
(6:36:31) then uh so I think nobody thinks that that's what's your opinion on that do you think a man is straight if they date
(6:36:36) a trans woman have you ever dated a transom no I mean transom are beautiful
(6:36:42) there's some beautiful trans don't even look like they're yeah what would you do if you like fell in love with I would
(6:36:47) not fall in love with the Trans how and then you didn't know until like the moment of shees Me no no no like what if
(6:36:54) she had like no she that's literally that's literally like if you don't disclose your trans status that I think
(6:37:02) that that's essay well I guess you're saying it would be non-consensual cuz you're not consenting
(6:37:07) to being with a man right that's that's deceiving you know if they're not disclosing that would I think that
(6:37:13) that's saay 100% sa but yeah it would be gay exactly thank you a man dating a
(6:37:19) transwoman that's that's what if they had the gender reconfiguration even if they have a [ __ ] a a uh she huh even if
(6:37:28) she I I mean you're not going to like this but like
(6:37:34) I don't I don't subscribe to your gender ideology so I don't even this is just
(6:37:40) like pretty much I think an ultimate defeater in all instances I don't believe in gender I believe in
(6:37:47) sex so oh okay so he she trust the science trust the
(6:37:54) science so I don't yeah gender I I don't look at at people as men and well men
() 
(6:38:00) and women is like pointing towards their sex yeah so you're like amab aab that's
(6:38:06) how you see them assign male at Birth assigned female at Birth you mean you mean no they're is that is that an
(6:38:12) assignment or a biological reality so for me they're male or they're female so aab or aab is how you see people not
(6:38:19) their gender identity not how no I see them as male they're currently male or they're currently female okay whether
(6:38:26) you get a whether you get the puberty blockers whether you put on the wig
(6:38:32) whether you get bre breast implants whether you get the uh uh gender the genitalia procedure or whatever you're
(6:38:39) still a male thank you D I love how you're eating popcorn
(6:38:45) while watching us but so um we that entertaining you're shaking your
(6:38:51) head you how can you disagree with me though you would have to I mean even if
(6:38:57) you're all for the transgender stuff and I don't I don't hate transgender people don't have a problem
(6:39:03) with them at all wouldn't date one but you'd have to agree with me that these people these transgender women are still
(6:39:11) male I think they're a woman but they could be amab assigned male at Birth but I would still see them as a woman
(6:39:18) assigned assigned male at Birth no so okay you use the word male so man and
(6:39:24) man and male at least in your worldview are different we're talking about gender identity here correct yeah but male is
(6:39:31) not a gender male is a sex right and that's your argument so I'm saying so
(6:39:37) you know I can still I can acknowledge that someone's amab but I can still see them as a woman if they're a woman now
(6:39:43) still yeah but okay so present day you're saying assigned male at Birth you're assigned male right
(6:39:50) now what a transgender woman is assigned male right now assigned male at Birth no
(6:39:59) I assigned mhood to you in California get it changed on their license like so
(6:40:05) just because a government document says something does that mean that's the truth I honor that I came into this
(6:40:12) world that's who you are no but hold on so I assign mhood to transgender
(6:40:19) women does that compute I understand what you're saying no but they're not just assigned male at
(6:40:26) Birth they mhood persists and the you agree or
(6:40:31) disagree I disagree so that's a woman I see her as a woman sure so their male their mhood does not
(6:40:38) persist so they're female correct how do they become F okay no I'm sorry I would I wouldn't necessarily say I wouldn't
(6:40:45) say that's a female cuz that's like what are they if they're not a female what are they that's a woman that's a lady she if they're not a female they must be
(6:40:53) what she her no no no what's okay you agree that there's you agree that
(6:40:59) there's male and fale I'm really not having this argument with you I think this is a dumb AR you're intellectually coward a coward or no I just I think
(6:41:06) it's a d dumb argument like I told you I can acknowledge someone's you know aab aab you know but I can see them for
(6:41:13) their gender identity and I will acknowledge and respect them as their gender identity it doesn't mean they're
(6:41:18) not amab or aab how about instead of gender identity they're sex
(6:41:24) reality what what does
(6:41:29) mean do you have anything you'd like to say what does sex reality mean like what is that he just like made that up right
(6:41:34) now oh okay oh it's not sex is not made up right now well he's saying presently
(6:41:40) right does that matter yeah it does matter I don't really care as long as people are happy than a day like that's
(6:41:46) their life are you bring Andrew back is oh he's Frozen no I I believe just once
(6:41:52) he's fixed or whatever it's funny it's funny huh Sten pocorn this is frozen
(6:41:59) okay he's gonna he's going to rejoin us um
(6:42:04) I think for you I think whatever you want to believe in that makes you happy you have the right to do that you're an adult like you have the free to do it
(6:42:12) doesn't mean it's true well in her opinion she believes it is in your opinion you don't it's not about opinion it's about fact okay but what is what
(6:42:19) you speak into the mic Miss what sorry what is the how do you define a fact in an opinion like like how do you
(6:42:26) everybody's like opinion and fact can be different no facts cannot be different
() 
(6:42:31) opinions can be different facts cannot be different I just think if she's happy
(6:42:37) she's that's why it's called factual okay I acknowledge that trans
(6:42:44) people exist but it's like there's just objective truth so
(6:42:49) again I'd like to ask you you would acknowledge that a transgender woman is
(6:42:57) male amab but yes male but I mean to me why can't but you just she her still a
(6:43:03) woman sure I'll okay fine I'll even abide by your worldview thank you that
(6:43:09) she has changed her gender yeah the transgender woman her gender is woman
(6:43:14) right uh but her sex is but then okay once biologically once
(6:43:23) they've had the hormone blockers you know or whatever you call it it's like physiology wise isn't that a
(6:43:30) woman I already granted to you it's a woman what I'm asking though is it a
(6:43:38) female no so a transgender woman is a
(6:43:43) male agree I'm not answering this question but I don't okay I don't agree but you
(6:43:52) just said it's not she a transgender woman I think I would say aab no I think no you just said a transgender woman is
(6:43:58) not female ER go she is yeah I'm not using this like derogatory
(6:44:05) language to just to be clear it's derogatory to call a male a
(6:44:12) male how why would that be derogatory I mean you can look at me but
(6:44:19) or you could say what's on your mind I don't have anything else to say to you do you want to concede the
(6:44:27) argument no okay so well I'm going to I'm done with this conversation I mean you can keep talking I suppose I will I
(6:44:34) suppose I will keep talking um I mean you've already granted that a transgender woman is not female so what
(6:44:41) must they be they want to be
(6:44:48) girl she her she her I mean whatever that person wants to
(6:44:53) be hold on is this just like a cognitive dis dissonance thing or did Andrew rate us or what happened
(6:45:03) that's weird did he rate US guys or what happened chat
(6:45:13) um so
(6:45:27) uh well I'm going to come right back to you but Emily oh no you you already corrected your position on this right
(6:45:33) okay you it's not straight for man yeah to dat a trans woman okay and I agreed
(6:45:39) with her yeah so I guess again I'll Grant to you that a transgender woman I
(6:45:44) don't believe this but I'll just grant it for the sake of the argument a transgender woman is a woman but you
(6:45:49) would have to agree that it's a transgender woman is not a female and is in fact
(6:45:56) male I agree with that I mean this is just total intellectual cowardice I I don't understand why you won't engage
(6:46:02) with the conversation I agree with that okay cool you just going to stare or what
(6:46:10) yes okay um can you define woman for
(6:46:18) me I think this is not a conversation howt now it's okay I mean I'm done
(6:46:24) having this conversation well I mean I would like to have the conversation because you said it was derogatory to
(6:46:29) call a male a male so I just want to make sure we're living on the same Planet
(6:46:35) here why would it be derogatory to call a male a
(6:46:42) male makes sense you just going to look you going just keep looking at me or you GNA is this cognitive distance do you
(6:46:49) want to reconsider your
(6:46:56) position even a lot of transgender activists don't make the argument
(6:47:03) that a transwoman is female so I don't see what
(6:47:10) your most my understanding most trans activists don't think that there's an actual change of the sex once you
(6:47:20) transition is is this what you do in your relationships you just Stonewall it's good it's good it's it's
(6:47:28) an abuse tactic but okay well we have it this woman is
(6:47:33) abusive because she's stonewalls but
(6:47:41) okay I mean essentially um have you messaged Andrew is
(6:47:47) everything okay let me uh check my text messages he just like disappeared he said I'm out I'm tired his eyes they're
(6:47:55) red my eye is red right now cuz it's my eyelash oh yeah is it going in your eye
(6:48:01) yeah I think so but I'm holding on
(6:48:10) um I'm just waiting for you to say something I mean just agree with
(6:48:22) him well they were going there do you want to come back they're good now I was Co sitting between them I was I'm not
(6:48:30) going to Li I can sit back there if you want baby girl yeah I just don't have space here do you think um do you think
(6:48:37) like transgender women should do you think trans better what
(6:48:43) about like in sports do you think transgender women should be allowed to play in women's
(6:48:49) sports oh wait what was the question I'm asking her oh thinkir you think transgender women should be allowed to
(6:48:55) play with women okay it's unfair yes if she's a
(6:49:01) woman then she can play sports with other women even in like sports like boxing or
(6:49:07) like that sort of thing yes
(6:49:13) yeah do you think um do you think women like so you're saying okay when it comes
(6:49:18) to the sports thing if they take the estrogen or whatever and they've lowered their testosterone level you think that
(6:49:25) that that's what makes a woman a woman is her endocrine system no I'm saying if she identifies as a woman then she's a
(6:49:32) woman I see her as a woman oh so she doesn't even have to take uh like hormones to compete against women in
(6:49:38) women's sports if you can give birth you're a woman if you can give birth you're not a woman can I say that and I can identify as whatever I want if they
(6:49:45) canid I feel that's a good point right there so I choose to identify as the correct person on this matter and I
(6:49:51) would like for you to affirm my identity a woman is a person who could have who could give birth no I would like here I
(6:49:58) would like for you I identify as correct on this matter and I wish for you to
(6:50:04) affirm my identity if you don't you're a
(6:50:09) bigot okay Dam bigot what is that slay Queen slay you go baby girl it's it's
(6:50:16) very derogatory that you will not affirm my my identity why won't
() 
(6:50:22) you we can agree to disagree can you your mic down and speak into we can agree to disagree I don't agree to
(6:50:29) disagree I I will agree that you're wrong and I'm right that's your opinion it's not my
(6:50:38) opinion uh okay well I mean you're just conceding the argument then I
(6:50:45) mean it's kind of like if you're playing soccer um Morgan over here she's just
(6:50:51) she plays soccer and if the other team just stands there and then then just lets the other
(6:50:57) team just keep scoring I mean you're just essentially conceding okay
(6:51:04) okay all right well um I disagree to
(6:51:10) disagree that's fine Everyone's entitled to their opinions here all right well I mean
(6:51:21) uh let me ask you this though but if if a transgender I I'm confused though if a
(6:51:26) transgender woman is a woman then surely you must believe that it would be straight for a man to date a trans woman
(6:51:35) right no I still think it's queer
(6:51:41) okay um so okay last
(6:51:46) time is a male a male
(6:51:54) yes is a so a transgender woman who's a male is a male
(6:52:02) no that's a woman I don't think you should reduce her to her previous
(6:52:07) whatever like however you see her and however she identifies that's how I see her and I don't think you should reduce
(6:52:14) women to a costume you think women are just a
(6:52:19) costume I'm so confused I don't know what he's saying well essentially you
(6:52:24) can you can be a transgender woman if you get fake boobs you put on a wig you put on some makeup I don't think that's
(6:52:31) really the essence of what a woman
(6:52:37) is all right well do you consider personating a woman if you don't have a woman can't give birth if you say you're
(6:52:43) a woman but you can't give birth and then lots of women can't give birth though it doesn't make them a woman even
(6:52:48) if a woman is for genetic reasons or whatever incapable of giving birth or she's too young or too
(6:52:54) old right you're still a woman women I mean I'm talking about a man a man
(6:52:59) transitioning to a woman he can't have periods he can't correct does that actually make him into the mic her does
(6:53:07) it actually make him into her a woman because now they can't do what we do
(6:53:12) until it's like an actual technology can invent that for them like what would you
(6:53:17) say to biic they can't so but what would you say to a woman that feels kind of impersonated at the fact that someone's
(6:53:23) trying to copy the fact that they give birth I know talking about
(6:53:28) that I mean like it's hard for a woman Interac with a man wanting to be like
(6:53:34) them and copying them when like we we go through what we go through as a woman already then someone wants to
(6:53:41) be like us but doesn't go through the pain we go through here what let me do this um by the way Andrew is coming back his internet just crashed I just got a
(6:53:48) text from him he'll be back um is sex and gender the same thing no may I get
(6:53:55) my energy drink cuz genuinely I'm very tired is it okay if I bring it to the table okay sure I didn't know if it has
(6:54:02) to be aw no you can that's fine um so okay uh the answer to the
(6:54:14) question can you ask me the question again yeah is sex and gender the same thing no no okay so when I ask you the
(6:54:22) question uh is a transgender woman male and you say it's a woman I'm
(6:54:30) not asking you what the gender is I'm asking you what the sex is yeah I understand what you're saying that's
(6:54:36) male sign male at Birth you know that's yeah they were assigned male at Birth
(6:54:43) but are you willing to state that in the in this now in the moment
(6:54:49) now they are male I wouldn't say male I would say
(6:54:56) amab it's just it just it just is less derogatory how Okay so
(6:55:02) explain to me how it's derogatory I think you know you're
(6:55:07) reducing someone to you know their previous how they were born but that's
(6:55:14) not who they identify as that's not who they are but you do can you change your
(6:55:21) sex no but you can change your gender so yeah I've already granted to you that
(6:55:28) they that in well at least I'm not actually granting but for the sake of the conversation I'm granting to you
(6:55:34) that the gender has changed the gender has went from man to woman MH okay but
(6:55:40) you've already you've just said that you can't change your sex right yes okay if
(6:55:45) you so this is the entailment of your own position now that you've just said that you cannot change your sex so if
(6:55:52) you were born male and you are male
(6:55:59) right you're not a female if you're a transgender woman correct
(6:56:06) correct so you're still what male I guess so a transgender woman
(6:56:17) is still a do you agree with the following statement a transgender woman
(6:56:23) is male transgender woman is a woman are
(6:56:29) you just biologically yes I'm using your own it's trans transitioning gender what
(6:56:35) sex are they no no no hold on okay cool transgender woman is a woman what sex are
(6:56:46) they I'm just I'm really done with this conversation but are are you going to
(6:56:52) offend somebody I I don't understand like it occurs to me like you know the answer to this why but why won't you say
(6:56:59) it like it's not I don't think this is offensive or derogatory despite your claims that it
(6:57:07) is again we can disagree on the matter no I can't I literally can't disagree
(6:57:14) that's hey that's your stance this is my stance ends of the table fine I'm I'm
(6:57:20) just I've walked you through it so you said you can't change your sex right so you've you've already conceited there
(6:57:27) you can't change your sex okay if you can't change your sex if you're a male
(6:57:32) and you cannot become a female if you were a male change your
(6:57:38) changing your gender identity does not change that you're a male you have using your own concessions already you'd have
(6:57:45) to agree with to this I understand what you're
(6:57:50) saying do you what am I tell me what I'm saying steal man my
(6:57:58) position like I said I'm done with this conversation I mean we we just keep circling and like we're good you
(6:58:07) know um you want to talk about anything else do you want to just stare each other for another hour I'm I'm willing
(6:58:14) to move on but I just it on this condition Define a woman for me and we'll move
(6:58:21) on I don't I don't know how to I don't know if I can give a definition of what
(6:58:26) a woman is this it's really like never thought about it
(6:58:33) I think a woman is anyone who identifies as a woman regardless of what sex you were
(6:58:40) given at Birth my security guard back there Desmond

(6:59:11) I is he a woman Desmond is this

(6:59:48) definition um okay all right
(6:59:54) well uh moving on yeah I guess I'm moving on all right final things here then we're going to do row session then
(6:59:59) we're going to wrap up the show okay uh what would you want the minimum yearly income to be for your future
(7:00:07) husband uh actually I should this is going to be out of order because people moved around Emily Deng uh you said six
(7:00:13) figures plus that's understandable okay uh and
(7:00:21) then Cali minimum income um it doesn't matter to me
() 
(7:00:30) Gina doesn't matter w you're not even talking in the microphone why don't you put the microphone back where it was so
(7:00:36) you can it was right here just turn it move it move it that
(7:00:42) way and just scoot it scoot it scoot it yep okay doesn't matter no as long as he
(7:00:49) can provide for me so it does matter I mean it doesn't matter exactly how much he
(7:00:56) makes what does providing for you look like so if you right exactly how it
(7:01:02) sounds like it doesn't matter exactly like I'm not live in California yes you want to stay in
(7:01:08) California probably I'm not sure okay um do you want to get married yes you want
(7:01:13) to have kids yes how many kids um I don't know yeah honestly maybe like
(7:01:19) two three three maybe okay and then uh while you're pregnant do you want to be
(7:01:26) working not while pregnant and then after they're born do you want to be working or do you want to stay at home
(7:01:33) I mean it depends like what type of job I'm doing like if it's like a simple or something something that I'm passionate
(7:01:39) about I don't mind Daman can you open the um but
(7:01:46) so do you want to stay at home at all when the kids are young and
(7:01:54) not work I mean how about until the youngest is into kindergarten
(7:02:03) I don't know so this could be like seven years maybe like I said like if I'm passionate about something I don't mind working it
(7:02:09) doesn't like really matter about like but what okay I'm but if you have kids like do you want to not
(7:02:15) work if I have kids why would not I mean I kind of just answer
(7:02:21) that while they're young probably not when they get older yeah yeah like while I'm pregnant is different but if I have
(7:02:27) kids in your household once you have kids and you're married uh do you want one or two cars one or two cars yeah
(7:02:34) well my car and my man's car so two okay how big of a house would you like to live in with your two kids M master and
(7:02:42) then a bedroom for each kid oh yeah like a house how many
(7:02:50) bedrooms that's kind of well it depends how many kids I have I can't just say like oh I want these okay well okay two
(7:02:57) rooms plus mine so three three rooms how many bathrooms two two okay you want a
(7:03:03) big backyard yes okay uh would you like kind of more luxury appliances and you
(7:03:11) know would you want the uh what's the term
(7:03:18) uh what part of town would you like to live in I'm not sure where do you currently live in like LA area Okay
(7:03:27) Valley uhle do you want to what kind of Lifestyle would you like would you like to go on a couple vacation a year
(7:03:34) yes okay uh and are you going to be uh do you want the 5050 relationship or do
(7:03:40) you want your man to be the bread winner um well I'm always going to be a bread
(7:03:46) winner so I don't ever mind putting money on the table however you said you disagreed in your notes you said
(7:03:52) disagree to women should go 50/50 on the first date and women should go 50/50 the
(7:03:58) entire relationship no so you okay I didn't mean but that was kind of like in a rush cuz you did say you want a
(7:04:03) provider so this seems to me this would indicate that you want somebody who makes more I feel like every woman wants a provider though so it's kind of like
(7:04:10) okay that's so you want two kids you want a three-bedroom house you want to stay in Southern California two two
(7:04:17) bathrooms uh you want two cars you want to go on vacation a couple times a year
(7:04:22) you sure it doesn't matter how much your man makes like I said I don't care about the amount as long as he can provide for
(7:04:28) me so if he's making well enough to McDonald's you want to be have that
(7:04:33) lifestyle okay well like I said the amount doesn't matter as long as he can provide for me so I'm I don't have like
(7:04:40) an oh he has to be a billionaire you know how much would he have how much would he have to make to be able to have all that like 100k a year six figures
(7:04:48) 200k like yeah like I don't even know how much you would have to make like yeah that's why I didn't even really answer it cuz it's like I don't know how
(7:04:55) much Amilia you say you uh 100K 100K six
(7:05:00) figures okay it doesn't really matter Emily you also want a sixf figureure
