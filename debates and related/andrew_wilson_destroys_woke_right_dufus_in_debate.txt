(0:00) so just to make sure woke right a group of people engaged in identity politics victim mentality hyperfixation on race
(0:05) and utilize tactics of coercion exclusion yes sir can you tell me why our founding fathers weren't woke right
(0:11) uh Andrew Wilson debates this misfit patriot here about the woke rights
(0:17) however before they get into the debate about the woke right misfit patriot has a few things to get off his chest
(0:23) against Andrew Wilson let's see how this debate goes down uh people like Andrew focus on religion right andrew calls
(0:30) himself I believe like a patriarchal Christian or Christian that believes in
(0:35) the patriarchy just like just Christian ethicist let's just All right thank you
(0:40) um but let's uh break down what his Christianity shtick is all about andrew
(0:46) is well known for arguing online with Only Fans hookers and he will claim that that's his duty as a Christian right to
(0:52) rebuke and call out bad behavior but that's not what he's doing ironically Andrew promotes more pornography than
(0:58) most people on the internet because he's platforming these women and
(1:03) turning it into a show like Jerry Springer instead of a real teachable moment we can all learn from i guarantee
(1:08) most of the girls uh that he converses with see a huge increase in their subscribers when they get on that
(1:14) whatever podcast or wherever he talks to them andrew's fans are probably the ones subscribing so they can jack off to some
(1:21) internet hero that to some hooker that their internet hero yelled at it's creating more filth online not less uh
(1:29) to break down his views on patriarchy um his wife has the same job he does she
(1:34) argues with people on the internet from her soap box of superiority but she's not a stay-at-home mom or trad she's an
(1:40) author she's a podcaster she monetizes her presence on the internet she makes money she files taxes she's basically a
(1:47) strong independent woman every moment she's on her phone arguing on the internet she's a hypocrite she's
(1:53) Andrew's business partner and that's a very progressive relationship if you ask me she promotes all this stuff online
(2:00) and for somebody who claims they want a par a patriarchal society him and her both agree that women apparently should
(2:08) talk back to men um because she talks
(2:13) back to men all the time on his behalf so that's a grift they fooled all of you andrew and his business partner don't
(2:18) want to create a better society based on traditional values they saw a market where they could capitalize off it
(2:24) they're brand developers his brand is shock value and this is clear to anybody with half a brain and if you added up
(2:29) all of his fans you'd fall short of that intellectual mark so to throw his Christianity his patriarchal uh views
(2:36) back in back at him with with those two tenants of woke
(2:41) um what he's doing is virtue signaling it's the opposite of Christianity jesus at the well rebuking the woman with the
(2:48) 5 hunds five husbands didn't call her a [ __ ] he said God is spirit and his
(2:55) worshippers must be worship must worship in the in the spirit and truth sorry I just woke up um I'm having a hard time
(3:04) reading okay he approached her with love and kindness he didn't mock and shame
(3:09) the adulteress in the street either he didn't laugh at her when he said he was without sin go and cast the first stone
(3:16) he showed her mercy and love i don't see any Christian values when I look at Andrew i see a bully who
(3:22) thinks he's God's gift to the internet the only thing smart about him and his ability is his ability to fool people
(3:27) into thinking he's something he's not he's a grifter you're all his mark no matter what we discuss over the next
(3:32) couple hours this opening statement is the only thing I really have prepared because I know this subject m matter
(3:39) better than anyone i fought the woke on both sides while he denies its existence
(3:45) he's already lost the debates on the merit i'm sure he'll see it differently so now we can just have fun so he can
(3:50) play his word games and own me because I don't give a [ __ ] about popularity that's woke [ __ ] so uh if you
(3:58) don't know what this debate's about this is about if there is a woke right or not
(4:03) now would you have gathered any of that would you have gathered that at all from the misfit patriots opening statement it
(4:10) sounds like it was just more of a crying session about how Crucible man bad Orthodox Christian man
(4:16) bad coping and seething before the debate even begins like what a freaking
(4:23) whiny baby this do I think there's a woke right well I will tell you why I do
(4:28) think there is one as this debate goes along thank you misfit that that was conclusion correct yes okay thank you um
(4:37) okay so kind reminder we will open the panel afterward so if you are interested in engaging in the conversation I
(4:43) believe both panelists will be joining us for open panel as far as I'm I'm aware of uh outside of that gentlemen I
(4:51) leave the floor open to you so you I just quick question so you think my audience is really [ __ ] stupid pretty
(4:58) much yeah okay got it so your your your idea was is that they're all marks and
(5:03) that they're so [ __ ] stupid that I'm just able to dupe them at a moment's notice you're very clever uh at tricking
(5:09) stupid people into thinking you're smarter than you are because of the way that you talk and use framing tactics that's what I believe you know what I
(5:15) say my IQ is don't give a [ __ ] yeah i say it's average you know why because it's average sure i don't think I'm
(5:21) incredibly intelligent i don't think you're stupid i think you're I just think I just think I'm much more intelligent than you are now to now to
(5:29) to the debate itself um you bring up there's a couple like hater remarks I
(5:35) don't mind going through before we get into this so I've heard this criticism a lot um should I uh do debates against
(5:41) leftist prominent leftists like Destiny um I wouldn't I would say that uh
(5:47) comparing Destiny to an only fans girl is a false equivalency but yeah sure
(5:52) okay is it is it not necessarily true that if I do debates with uh creators
(5:58) like Destiny because I have a large platform that he's probably going to peel off a good portion of my audience or at least some portion of my audience
(6:04) and vice versa well yeah i think I see what you're doing like you're going to be promoting the the Only Fans girls and
(6:11) you're going to be getting them more no no just answer my question dude is it true yes it's true that Destiny may may
(6:17) get may get viewers because you debate him do you think that he engages in debates with large prominent right-wingers like myself because he
(6:24) thinks that he'll be able to peel off portions of that audience for himself i don't know why but maybe i mean that
(6:30) probably it follows right yeah it's one of the reasons so by your logic should I not debate with large prominent leftists
(6:36) because there's a possibility that they can peel off some of my audience it's a false equivalency I believe can you answer my question yes you should yes I
(6:44) should okay so then if that's the case isn't it the case then that the types of people who would gravitate towards
(6:50) Destiny who are in my audience right uh those types of people would be looking for somebody like that anyway that just
(6:57) because I'm there to rebuke them or to debate with their ideas does not mean I endorse their ideas or endorse what it
(7:03) is that they're doing right again a false equivalency what's the false equivalency this is the these are the
(7:09) framing tactics that you use right you create a false equivalency then ask a bunch of questions what's the false equivalency don't you agree that's the
(7:14) false equivalence test is not promoting no he's way worse he's way worse than an Only Fans girl way worse than an Only
(7:20) Fans girl sure sure you're But you're the Christian that is promoting the How
(7:26) am I promoting it show me the promotion well because these girls would not be on the internet promoting their I don't think Destiny would be on the internet
(7:32) promoting it if he had no viewers either so the thing is is like me engaging with the ideology i would argue that his his
(7:38) um his views which I disagree with are not as dangerous as pornography way more
(7:44) dangerous he's the guys like him are the guys who push it everywhere in all corners they're the guys in fact um who
(7:52) who have actual Democrat money pouring into their channels and and let me give
(7:57) you an example of one such organization which does this i don't know if you're aware of this or not but Briana Woo
(8:04) who's a prominent leftist inside of these spheres created a left-wing organization which included Destiny
(8:10) Vosch a whole bunch of other creators they bought up Twitch politics in order to push the message of degeneracy they
(8:16) were going on every conservative platform they possibly could to get that message out it was the fact that guys
(8:21) like me were there to completely eviscerate their ideologies that that entire endeavor failed right what you're
(8:28) what you're actually saying to me here is that because I go on a show where these women's views would be completely
(8:33) [ __ ] unchallenged if I didn't that that would be better to leave them there unopposed rather than go on there
(8:40) because there's a possibility that some people could peel off towards that ideology so what you're saying what
(8:45) you're saying is that a liberal espousing their own views in a respectful debate is the same thing as a
(8:52) hooker you think that Destiny debates respectfully i don't think you do so I
(8:58) think Yeah do you think he does he No I don't no no he doesn't and the thing is is that if you had ever watched a single
(9:05) episode of Whatever don't lie you haven't because otherwise you would know well I don't that's exactly right
(9:10) otherwise you would know that these debates actually are respectful until the other the other position becomes
(9:16) disrespectful begins personal attacks begins things like this now what I engage in is a de is a deescalation tact
(9:24) no no it's a deescalation tactic so often times if somebody's highly insulting towards you if you hit back
(9:30) they'll often times it'll deescalate what's going on it doesn't it doesn't escalate it further they're hookers
(9:37) right yeah do you think that h that because you're a hooker that means you're stupid do you think that these hookers with college degrees who come
(9:44) out of these universities who have they have degrees in psychology philosophy
(9:49) they have degrees in all kinds of [ __ ] hold on do you think that Do you think that Jes I I watched a clip of you now i
(9:55) never watched the full episode but I've seen plenty of clips right do you think that Jesus would have called this called
(10:00) a girl a [ __ ] and done the D like are you are you you call people retards all the time i am not you i'm not coming out
(10:07) and my audience well how can you are you so you're going to hold me to a standard you won't hold yourself to 100% but only
(10:13) because you only because Hold on only because you hold You're the one that You're the one that's preaching dude
(10:20) what no i specifically say I have no ministry i'm not a preacher and I make zero orthodox content zero you have You
(10:28) have this moral superiority complex where you're telling everybody what is right what's the morals well okay so I
(10:34) that is true that I say that there's objective morality you would agree with that that Christian ethics are the objective morals in which we ought live
(10:39) our lives you agree with that but you can't say at the same time that you agree with those two statements that me saying you're a [ __ ] and you saying
(10:46) you're a [ __ ] uh somehow somehow doesn't negate the fact that you're doing the exact same thing while you're
(10:52) trying to quote call me out like how does that work bro well because it's very easy right i don't I don't come on
(10:59) the internet and say I am this this this um I guess you could say teacher of I
(11:06) literally say I'm not a teacher i'm not your guru i'm not a preacher i'm not a minister not here to do any of those
(11:11) things so So you have an out right you say it's my duty to my duty to rebuke then you then you mock and shame instead
(11:18) of teach so do you yeah but this is Hold on what's the difference here why what
(11:26) about Andrew what aboutisism is exactly what I'm talking about with woke right right what woke right about oh grown
(11:34) grown yeah so yeah listen the first part of the debate so far is just how you
(11:40) know Orthodox Christian man bad how Andrew Wilson is bad and he's whining and complaining now listen I'm not
(11:46) saying that there's not some truth in what he's saying in terms of the false equival equivalency stuff uh I get where
(11:52) Andrew is coming from but at the same time yeah uh debating Destiny isn't exact
(11:58) same thing as debating debating an OF girl but I think Andrew could defend
(12:04) debating an OAF girl just like he could defend debating Destiny because as as
(12:10) freaking stupid Misfit Patriot says he's never seen a Whatever podcast episode so
(12:15) he's only seen the clips but I was the same way i never seen at whatever podcast until uh you know Andrew started
(12:23) going on there and like Jim Bob and stuff like that and now that I've actually watched
(12:30) episodes like pretty much like full episodes I understand it's not just about like yelling at OAF girls that
(12:37) there's actually good conversations that happen on there and and also too not all of them are OF girls there are just
(12:43) women that are from different types he's had uh Brian's had on conservative women on there and stuff too so it's not just
(12:51) about having OF girls on there see if you don't watch the show you would think that it was cuz I thought it was that
(12:56) too i thought it was just people berating OAF girls but if you actually watch the episode you would see it's not
(13:02) just about that but second of all even if it was having conversations with OAF
(13:08) girls if you actually watch the episode you would see it's not just Andrew yelling at them or mocking at them or
(13:14) making fun of them andrew actually does engage in good faith conversations with them and the bottom line is is that some
(13:21) of these women some of these people have probably never thought about this stuff they've never thought about these things
(13:27) and so I think it's important that Andrew does have these conversations with them because other otherwise as
(13:34) Andrew was is saying they're just going to go about their lives doing their same old thing being reckless not being reckless being selfish not thinking
(13:41) about the greater good of society so so no I don't think what Andrew is
(13:46) doing is woke right but I think trying to tone police Andrew and telling him who he's allowed to have conversation
(13:54) with I think that kind of sounds like woke right to me what do you think i I
(13:59) would tend to agree with you that generally an argument from hypocrisy doesn't hold merit and in this case I'm
(14:06) not even making one i'm just saying that if it is the case that your claim is Andrew thinks he's morally superior therefore bad and my claim that he's
(14:13) morally superior is because he does X activity which is shame bad people online then if I ask you the same
(14:19) question are you shame bad people online how's that not moral an act of moral
(14:25) superiority your answer is because I'm not I'm not morally superior right i am Oh because you're not you're not because
(14:31) you're not i am not so you engage in the same exact behavior and tactics but I'm morally superior you're not
(14:37) against against everybody bro bro I I'm against everybody every You want to go through your tweets bro i I am a I am a
(14:44) bully to bullies bro i'm I'm You're a bully to bullies hypocrite i'm a hypocrite i'm a hypocrite okay well this
(14:51) that was great man you really did me in with that one i am a I am a hypocrite if
(14:56) your argument If your argument though if you got to take me out of it cuz what
(15:01) aboutism is never an argument right if your argument is this is what's right
(15:06) and wrong and then you engage me completely out of it you engage in the behavior that you
(15:13) yourself then we are both hypocrites because we're both No just you and me explain actually I'll explain it cuz I'm
(15:20) not promoting an only fans talking about being neither am I gentlemen I just neither am I but let me but let me let
(15:27) me uh give a counter you you can absolutely i just want to make sure that we're we're realizing that we are a
(15:34) little off topic yeah yeah we'll finish we'll finish we'll finish and move into the tactics or into the topic so uh
(15:40) actually it would just be you who's a hypocrite so here's why because you this
(15:45) is your standard you're holding for me not my standard I'm holding for you i didn't say that you had a superiority complex i didn't say that it was not
(15:52) okay for you to rebuke people who you had a problem with these are not my positions this is your position by your
(15:58) admission you're a hypocrite by my admission I'm not i think it's perfectly acceptable as Jesus Christ did to call
(16:03) people vipers whitewashed tombs the distinction of the time with Jesus Christ you would have gotten killed for
(16:10) calling somebody a name like that they [ __ ] killed you it wasn't like a oh
(16:15) you're an [ __ ] and you go about your day cuz it was freedom of speech they pulled out a [ __ ] sword and cut your
(16:20) ass in half why do you think the apostles all got killed all of almost all of them got killed in horrible ways
(16:26) because they said things which were considered offenses right you don't run
(16:32) the risk of that you don't run the risk of like being [ __ ] executed because you call me names on the internet in the
(16:40) in the modern world what I'm saying has to be far less offensive than what was being said by Christ cuz it's not a
(16:46) killable offense do you understand that it's not a killable offense these things are ways for us to engage in modernity
(16:54) with the people who are saying these things and give reputations and rebukes in a way which which will hold eyeballs
(17:00) you though sir by making the bold claim that I am holding a morally superior
(17:06) position and then holding yourself to the same standard are actually a hypocrite i though am not yeah that was
(17:13) a really nice spin i'm waiting for you to give me a reputation i already I already did i basically already did i
(17:19) don't know i already I already did right and I can actually I can actually kind of double down on that because the way
(17:24) that I engage in debate with you which is I tried last time in good faith until I sort of figured out how you do it i
(17:31) try to actually stick to the topics whereas you you like to laugh and you like to you like to get into these like
(17:36) these like self flatulation like just you brought all this up dude yeah I did it in my opening yeah Mr i like to stick
(17:43) to the topic meanwhile this has just been a whole big cop and seed session over Andrew now let's move on to the and
(17:49) so I and so I gave reputations and my reputation stands you were not able to counter it so onto the topic of the wolf
(17:55) hold on one one final thing when you say you you weren't able to counter it after
(18:00) I countered it that's you didn't counter it it's your opinion and it's the frame no no no i gave an argument you
(18:05) basically literally just after every argument Andrew you say I win and you do it over and over only if I win only if I
(18:12) win yeah if you don't offer if you don't like listen that you know how arguments work
(18:19) you give you give reputations you give reputation to what a person say you can't double down and say I I self-proclaim myself to be a hypocrite
(18:25) and then by my standard of me being a hypocrite by my standards you are too I don't hold the same standards and gave
(18:30) you the reputation let's let's move on this is going to be okay we'll go on so let's go let's move on to the woke right
(18:36) then okay okay so can I that was just pathetic that was just sad like imagine
(18:42) coming on here and then just spending the their whole opener of this debate about the woke right just bitching and
(18:49) whining like a woman about Andrew and trying to tone police him trying to say
(18:54) who he could have debates with and whatnot that he's it's the same logic with the woke left like whenever there's
(19:01) a left-winger that goes on a right-winger's platform or has a right-winger on their show they're like
(19:06) "Oh why are you platforming these people you shouldn't be talking to these people you're platforming
(19:12) them whoa well what's Misfit Patriot doing you can't talk to OF girls they're
(19:18) hookers why are you platforming them a definition of the woke right yes uh it
(19:23) is a group of people that engage in identity politics a victim mentality uh
(19:29) with a hyperfixation on race um and I would say that the closest group that
(19:35) sort of I I think embodies the entirety of it would be the Groper movement right
(19:41) where the left has the left has the evil white the evil white capitalist is the
(19:46) source of Well hang on can we just stay with the definition first and I just make sure I get it down correctly so a group of people who engage in identity
(19:53) politics and identity politics have a victim mentality uh okay they uh have a hyperfixation on
(20:02) race okay whereas let's say like my race is better than yours right got it yep
(20:08) moral superiority or I guess that would be identity politics um and
(20:14) what's the other one uh I can't remember what I said victim mentality race and uh
(20:19) identity politics those are the three I would say main tenants oh I'm sorry the fourth one is and the final one there's
(20:25) four is the tactics of coercion and exclusion essentially cancel culture when you disagree with them it's it's
(20:32) group think mob mentality where they where they will attack their uh the people who disagree or they label the
(20:38) people that they disagree a label like woke right they label the people they
(20:44) disagree with a bad label because it discourages conversation which I mean
(20:49) isn't that what Misfit Patriot is trying to do right now trying to label uh for
(20:54) instance the gripers as woke right and therefore you shouldn't really talk to
(21:00) them and therefore we should exclude them from the conversation
(21:06) huh h interesting so just to make sure woke right a group
(21:11) of people engage in identity politics victim mentality hyperfixation on race and utilize tactics of coercion and
(21:16) exclusion yes sir can you tell me why our founding fathers weren't woke right uh yes I can actually so we have the
(21:24) founders um who let's say exclusion let's see so they are a group of people
(21:29) who definitely engaged in identity politics in a very big way they definitely had a victim mentality they
(21:35) were they they emphasized individual rights and moral they had a well hang on i'm just going by your criteria they had
(21:41) a hyperfixation on race and they definitely practiced coercion and
(21:46) massive exclusion they excluded women they excluded uh minorities they basically excluded every they even
(21:51) excluded Jews they excluded everybody who wasn't a far western European
(21:57) Christian that would be mostly Britain and France um and they definitely had a fixation on race they definitely had a
(22:04) victim mentality they were saying that England was persecuting them yeah we're just we're arguing this yeah yeah so so
(22:10) how is it that they don't fit how is it that our founders don't fit every single criteria of the woke right because it's
(22:16) 2025 that's that's not an argument if woke was created in in 1776 you could
(22:23) make this argument so George was George Washington woke right yeah again this I'm not I'm not playing this can you
(22:29) answer my question was George Washington woke right no because it didn't exist oh oh because it because it didn't exist
(22:35) you're asking me to listen was Okay can I ask you Let me ask a different question then did George Washington
(22:42) engage in identity politics again identity politics the founders emphasized indivi now for their time uh
(22:49) they they emphasized individual rights moral agency over group identity they
(22:54) endorsed broader principles right exact for example equality under the law now I
(22:59) understand that there was for everybody all equality was a different word back then oh so it wasn't for everybody so
(23:05) they definitely practice exclusion we can agree on that under under the law of their time so we can definitely say they
(23:10) practice exclusion equality under the law would you say that would you say slavery is coercion
(23:16) under that law no they didn't they didn't view slavery the same way so
(23:21) slavery was not coercion you're trying to create a false equivalency then why did they outlaw international slavery
(23:26) why did why did our founders outlaw international slavery and they only used localized slavery nine out of the 13
(23:32) colonies were against slavery slavery was on its way out before this country was um international slavery was slavery
(23:38) persevered until the late 1800s when we had a civil war they did i'm not saying it was but they definitely pra Can I Can
(23:43) you just answer my questions i think they definitely practiced exclusion and coercion not under their laws okay so
(23:51) how would how did they not practice exclusion under their laws under their laws those those exclusions were legal
(23:57) so as long as it's legal it's so so if the Gropers got everything they wanted and it was legal that would be fine then
(24:03) well that's the total there's a totalitarian argument to the woke right where they want to change the law yeah i know but you're not really engaging here
(24:09) so the thing is is if all the gropers if it is the case that it's it was okay because it was the law if the gropers
(24:15) got everything that they Okay so then was it coercion and exclusion did they
(24:21) practice coercion and exclusion uh for that time yes okay they did so
(24:27) they've they meet at least the fourth category uh did they hyperfocus on race
(24:34) um again you're talking about a different time can you just answer my question this is your argument then
(24:40) you're you're creating a [ __ ] argument okay but can can you just listen i'll answer to your cross-examination with yes or nos can
(24:47) you do that for me yes they did Andrew okay they did they hyperfocused on race do you think that they engaged in
(24:52) identity politics um they again emphasized individual
(24:59) rights and moral agency they didn't want So that was that was identitarianism under the axiom of God right the axiom
(25:07) of God was our identity as a Christian nation is that we hold these truths to
(25:12) be self-evident under God that this people group deserves X rights right i
(25:18) agree yes okay so then there would be identitarians for sure and they practiced identity politics for sure
(25:23) right identity as a nation well as a people group as well because not everybody could participate in the
(25:28) nation unless they were part of certain people groups you could say that yes okay so then what you have established
(25:35) then is that our founding fathers were all woke right by your admission if you want to try to fit that square peg in
(25:41) that round hole by your definition the founders were woke right well no you just conceded that every portion of the
(25:48) definition that you gave applies to the founding fathers which would include George Washington right sure yeah so
(25:55) basically George Washington is woke right yes andrew okay george Washington
(26:01) is under your under your definition is is walk right well it's how how is it my
(26:07) definition did I give you a definition of walk right i'm sorry under your right under my under my definition that you
(26:14) utili that you manipulated how did I manipulate it i just applied it i just applied it this
(26:20) is why I had to say this in my opening statement what you do is you manipulate conversation that's not manipulation
(26:26) it's an argument yeah and what I did was a Socratic method in order to apply your definition and see if you consistently
(26:32) would apply it across the board because you asked me a question over and over again if they if they engaged in identity politics and I told you they
(26:38) they emphasized individual individual rights they fought Yeah but those rights didn't apply to everybody right they
(26:44) fought to get they fought to get rid of slavery as opposed to what the woke right now is which is Did they fight to
(26:50) give women did they fight to give women rights at the time i don't think so no no so the thing is is that they were try
(26:56) but they were trying to yeah they no but but if it is the case that you exclude
(27:01) half of the population that would be pretty identitarian right there was a focus on race but it wasn't exclusionary
(27:07) it was in it wasn't exclusionary the focus on race by our founders was not exclusionary did you say that I say that
(27:14) they were trying to end slavery by by the founding of this country they were on their way to working towards a
(27:20) society no they abolished international slavery and then kept They kept grandfather's slavery in until all of
(27:26) them were dead when we hold these truths to be self-evident that all all men are created but not women right yeah exactly
(27:33) you're talking about a different time yeah so not all women so then it's exclusionary definitionally right if you
(27:39) view this argument through the lens of of 1776 my definition and yours can be can
(27:46) be taken as woke right if you if you use this framing tactic yeah well it's not a
(27:51) framing tactic is just applying it so if I were to say for instance uh would you
(27:57) would you reductive would you consider well yeah of course no I'm just reduc it
(28:02) is true that I'm reducing the argument but the thing is is arguments beg to be reduced so that we can see if they're
(28:08) consistent when we move back for instance if I were to ask you uh the a
(28:13) lot of the founders you agree with me like Thomas Jefferson were deists right uh yeah there was a couple yeah they
(28:19) were deist you wouldn't say that those are Christians would you no okay But even though that at the time right
(28:25) the way that Christianity was practiced uh in the United States far different than it is now but you can still make
(28:31) the application for consistency as to what a Christian was or wasn't your idea of woke right is taking a descriptor of
(28:38) behaviors and then with the descriptor of behaviors you're trying to assign it a label in this case woke right that's
(28:44) fine to do but the descriptor needs to apply across all groups so otherwise the
(28:49) descriptor is meaningless doesn't point to anything because this descriptor is about behavior it's just like with the trans movement if you were to say a
(28:56) woman is a woman is a woman is a woman it's an infinite regress so if I said misfit patriot what is a woman and you
(29:03) said a woman is anybody who identifies as a woman you've given me an empty label it doesn't point to anything when
(29:08) you say woke right you're saying this points to a pattern of behavior if that's the case then by the metric of
(29:14) this pattern of behavior all of these guys our entire founding father all of them would be woke right sure
(29:20) so if that's the case then who's closer to the ideals of the founding fathers
(29:26) you or the [ __ ] Crovers um I would say me because I g I don't
(29:33) ask for authoritar I don't ask for laws to be changed in order for my Hold on
(29:39) they set these laws right so we started with these are the American laws right
(29:44) the founders founded the law they didn't try to change the laws that they founded they founded the laws that we are
(29:50) supposed to abide by okay so they're trying to change the laws of the founders no they're not listen here like
(29:58) I'll give you an example um and the thing is I'm not a groper but this is so silly it's so easy it's so easy for me
(30:05) to dismantle it i said you were woke right adjacent to Yeah but I mean I I I'm not saying you did i'm just saying
(30:11) like I'm not even a graper and this still is just so easy to dismantle it makes no sense so if we go through this
(30:17) um when you say well our founders are trying to give us laws we can't dismantle that's just factually not true
(30:22) they gave us they hang on they gave us multiple amendment processes to do this like for instance we have the 19th
(30:28) amendment we have the 18th amendment right which was the prohibition on alcohol we have I mean I could go through line after line the same thing
(30:34) with the 10th amendment which gave states all sorts of appropriate rights to change including the state religion
(30:40) if they wanted to it's like how how could you even make this argument that well they want to change laws like so do
(30:46) you think that the gropers are are arguing for constitutional amendments and due pro and legal process of
(30:53) changing laws or do you think that they're saying like we need to kick every Indian out of the country do you
(30:58) lawfully I've only ever heard them say lawfully that they want to do these things I I think I' I've heard it
(31:03) differently than well when where are they advocating violence I don't see them advocating violence do you want me
(31:08) to go right now into You can't take You can't take anons because if you take anons I can go on any side of the
(31:15) political spectrum no no no let's go with Nick let's go with Nick nick Fuentes yesterday right no yeah so I
(31:21) guess this wasn't anon but Nick Fuentes one of his groper followers threatened
(31:27) to rape and murder Yeah sarah Fields right literally like full yeah I saw that i saw Yeah I saw I saw the exchange
(31:34) now I understand you can't be held to account you can't you can't you literally can't put it at the feet of
(31:39) the organization that a guy does bad action i understand but it's a it's a pattern of behavior and like I said I
(31:46) have many many DMs from these gripers like I'm I'm talking Well look I'm not here to defend gripers right or the
(31:52) anons of gripers but I am pointing out that uh Fuentes himself as far as I've
(31:58) seen has never advocated any sort of violence towards anybody um at least not any more than you do like if you joke
(32:04) around and go "These people need to get the [ __ ] out of here if they don't love this country." I don't think that's an advocation of violence but the thing is
(32:10) is like if these people on the woke right what you consider to be the woke right are just advocating that hey we
(32:16) want to change the laws to tailor them to whatever people group we have so [ __ ] what that's literally part of
(32:22) the democracy process isn't it sure i think again I think Yeah another thing
(32:27) is too is that I remember like back in the early days of like the social justice warriors stuff like that of of
(32:33) the culture wars if you will one of the things they would always point to like with the feminism the
(32:38) feminists would be like well I get death threats you know look at all the violent rhetoric that they they espouse you know
(32:44) they would say about right-wingers at the time their term was outright look at the outright and the rhetoric that they
(32:51) that they spew toward us and such and now you have misfit Patriot over here
(32:57) complaining about the rhetoric that the Gropers spew which by the way why do you have to create a term like woke right to
(33:03) to to um describe the Gropers there's already a name the Gropers just call them the Gropers you don't need this
(33:09) label like woke right again you're trying to create a label here to ostracize a group of people cuz you know
(33:16) the term woke already has a negative connotation to it so you think that's a more powerful
(33:22) um uh that's a powerful way to signal to people who are outside of the political
(33:27) sphere or who aren't you know like the normies pretty much uh to to get across
(33:34) that these people are bad it's the same way as when the left also started to
(33:39) label people like oh like the outright or um uh racists bigots all these things
(33:45) transphobes islamophobes they would come up with labels too to ostracize groups
(33:51) of people to let people know you shouldn't listen to these groups of people cuz
(33:56) they're bad trust us they're bad which isn't that what misfit
(34:01) Patriots trying to do right now huh hm H
(34:06) a little too reductive i understand that arguments are made to be reduced like you said but the woke the let's call
(34:13) with let's go with the groper movement let's just use the groper movement as a baseline of the group that we're talking about because they fit the most because
(34:19) they piss off Jordan Peterson right and they piss off James Lindsay because they troll and and by the way James Lindsay's
(34:25) argument is not my argument which is which is funny i never heard of James Lindsay i was I was calling the woke
(34:31) right the woke right in 2021 and it's because the woke left was trying to
(34:37) cancel me and in the process of canceling me there were people on the right that didn't like my personality
(34:42) and they would literally team up and I noticed this is just a personal thing this wasn't broadly defining anything i
(34:49) noticed I was like "These are conservatives but they're they're like harassing me they're they're being really woke they're using woke language
(34:55) they're they're changing lang language definitions." Like what um well like they like you know just the it's just
(35:01) stupid stuff you know like on on Tik Tok where you're like where they would say the word grape like the fruit instead of
(35:09) rape like Well that's because the Tik Tok toos will throw you off if you don't Exactly so they're they're willingly
(35:14) they're willingly giving up their first amendment i never did that right wait how is that woke well when you self
(35:19) censor when you self censor you're sort of you're sort of giving giving up your own first amendment right right no no no
(35:25) no no so that would be coercion right so the idea here would be if you want to
(35:30) have a platform to speak right and you have to censor what you're saying like if you were an AM radio host yeah this
(35:38) is and you had to and you had to to self censor because the [ __ ] FCC said that you couldn't play like gangster rap
(35:45) music or some [ __ ] like that i don't think you're being censored dude i get it i get it let's let's move on because
(35:50) that So saying grape instead of the actual R word well that's woke now hm
(35:56) that's being awoke rightest you know listen I I do agree people like you know
(36:01) I know as a YouTuber you know like I've kind of relaxed a lot of my language now because I've kind of seen YouTube isn't
(36:08) as strict as it was before but sometimes I'm still a little
(36:13) scared to say certain things because listen I make money from my YouTube channel i don't want to get demonetized
(36:20) i don't want my channel getting taken down so in the past I would substitute
(36:25) different words for this word or something and sometimes people in the comments would be like "Why do you say that what why do you say it like that
(36:32) how dare you?" It's like "Well dude listen like I got bills to take care of." Or if it's the same thing like
(36:38) Andrew Wilson said it's more coercion i'm not saying grape because I like saying that word and I'm af I'm afraid
(36:44) of triggering someone or something like that i'm not trying to do it because oh some people's feelings might get hurt or
(36:51) some people's past trauma no I'm strictly saying it because I don't want to get demonetized that's it that's all
(36:57) the reason I'm saying it for now just because there are some people that get I don't know freaking Now just because
(37:02) there's some people that get really upset because I used to say smishion instead of abortion yeah I wouldn't call those
(37:09) people woke right just a little small bullet point um but anyway I would have a bunch of people that were on the right
(37:15) like conservatives MAGA that were doxing me and and attacking me and and it was
(37:20) just I was like "These people sound really woke." So I called them woke right i called them woke conservatives
(37:26) this is in 2021 never heard of James Lindsay until like a few months ago james Lindsay's argument he's coming at
(37:31) it from like a sort of intellectual side and when I when I look at him I'm like he's talking about moral relativism and
(37:37) I'm like "Dude he's you lost me right he's making it very complicated." I think that what we're what we're doing a
(37:43) lot of people when we're trying to define the woke right is we're trying to isolate a bad group of actors which we
(37:49) believe are a bad group of actors who you disagree with yeah we disagree with them and we're just trying to identify
(37:55) them that way we are not broadly defining like so like I said you're not woke right so when we're saying woke
(38:02) right the the vast majority of people we're trying to basically go hey these people are acting a lot like leftists
(38:08) they're making everything about identity politics everything about race everything about oh somebody else is responsible for all of my problems right
(38:13) well let's go well let's go through that then because I still I don't even think that makes a lot of sense so I would
(38:19) make the the bold claim first and foremost that all politics are identity politics i think that's I think that's
(38:24) kind of fair it's on a spectrum all politics are identity politics no I think that's fair so then by by your
(38:32) admission and by my admission we would say that all political groups engage in identity politics and all people who
(38:38) have political opinions are engaging in identity politics as well right sure a hyperfixation on identity politics is
(38:44) the argument we're making for well all if all politics are identity politics then all of us are hyperfocusing on that
(38:50) if we're making political claims it's not the it's not the main thing that we focus on when we make our arguments some
(38:56) of us I mean most of us right I mean but it is right you have an identity or you I'm sorry you have a ideology which you
(39:04) identify with that you're promoting right ideology is the main tenant of politics right this is my ideology this
(39:10) is yeah but that would be identitarianism would be an your identity is tied in with the idea so for
(39:15) instance I'm a Christian ethicist you couldn't untie Christianity from my ethics
(39:21) yeah sure so that would be part of my identity right like if Andrew Wilson was no longer orthodox Christian that you
(39:28) would be talking to a different Andrew Wilson than the one you're talking to if your goal is to just reduce this all to
(39:34) you can you can apply this here too then yes you can apply anything to this argument and make it seem the way that
(39:41) you're Well I'm not trying to make it seem like anything right i I'm just looking for check consistency i was very
(39:46) clear here's the check consistency a hyperfixation on identity politics yeah
(39:52) but I'm arguing that all politics are is a hyperixation on identity well then okay well then don't you don't
(39:58) hyperfixate on your identity as it pertains to ideology
(40:03) i don't think so no I So you don't promote that you're a Christian as your identity it's a side note to me i You
(40:09) don't You don't You don't hyperfocus made if I was a Christian or not my arguments could be made the same
(40:15) way no they couldn't that would not be possible yeah cuz I I make arguments based off of Okay well here I'll show
(40:21) you i'm con I'm a constitutional no no I'll prove it to you i'll hang on i'll actually prove this so that you understand cuz look um what you're
(40:28) saying right now actually can't be true here I'll give you the the uh example do
(40:33) you agree with me that incest is wrong it's immoral yes okay we could we could
(40:39) we're going to base that on Christian Christian ethics right as an atheist sure as an atheist tell me
(40:47) why two homosexual brothers having sex with each other is actually wrong i mean I honestly can't answer the how
(40:55) an atheist would argue it because they can't no but I'm not an atheist i don't Right right that means that your
(41:00) identity is tied in hold on i'll take my best stab at it okay go ahead my best stab at it is it's against the law
(41:06) that's all you can say go ahead go ahead go ahead i think that human beings and I know that you'll probably say that's an
(41:12) identity human beings would probably just reject that just naturally instinctually right so instinct so yes
(41:18) again you can reduce this all to everything can be Who cares if they that doesn't make the claim it's immoral
(41:23) because people reject it but yeah identity politics again right where it's a hyperfixation where this is what I am
(41:30) i am a blank right putting us into these these little mini Well you have to do that because otherwise you have no
(41:37) identity you are a Christian identitarian all we're trying to do is say that your No yes identity is what we
(41:44) are all arguing what people like me are doing is saying your identity is woke
(41:49) right and But okay but if it if if it is the case that the criteria matches
(41:55) completely with your own ideology you would also be included in this woke so if you're hyperfocusing on identity
(42:02) politics which you are if it is the case that you trumpet your Christianities being the main corset of your identity
(42:08) which it must be because if I separated Christianity from you the person you are
(42:13) no longer the same person correct when I argue politics my constitutionality is the main argument yeah but your
(42:19) constitutionality is forming through a prism of Christian ethics or you don't know how to apply it right again again
(42:25) it's a spectrum that So that's like the hyperfocusing on identity politics it's the same thing as a racialist
(42:31) no I think I think when you go with the constitution you're going off an objective state set of facts right which is and a subjective state of facts well
(42:38) no like you have we have the constitution it's essentially the the rule book no no no no listen okay well
(42:44) fine if it's objective then are you saying that rights exist objectively yeah the where the United States has
(42:52) these these inalienable obviously there's the inalienable rights and then there's the laws right yeah but where do
(42:57) they exist in the constitution yeah but where where do these rights exist in
(43:02) reality except in your brain what dude you're losing me yeah yeah so
(43:08) so do you have a right to own a gun yes under the okay you have a right to own a
(43:13) gun under the constitution right yes but isn't that just a concept like you don't actually have that right right yes again
(43:20) you can do you can do this all day where you reduce it down to Well this isn't even a reduction i'm just I'm just
(43:25) clarifying the statement that you're you're that rights are conceptual it's just that the Second Amendment is just this nuanced thing that we No it's not
(43:32) nuanced i think the Second Amendment here let me give it to you i'll just tell it to you off top of my head a well-regulated militia being necessary
(43:38) to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed i could go down a bunch of them bunch a big line of
(43:43) them i know the Constitution inside and out right not every uh preamble which
(43:48) has ever existed in it but I could probably even reference a lot of those but the thing is is that these are
(43:54) axiomatic concepts the axiom beings one nation under God that's an axiom this is saying we hold these truths to be
(44:01) self-evident that's the axiom right uh that these rights are inalienable under
(44:08) God this is axiomatic right but that's conceptual because if you go to other countries you don't have these rights
(44:14) Right i guess I I don't know yeah so they're not inalienable really except as far
(44:21) except as far as we can enforce them right we hold them to be self-evident right all men are created equal yeah but
(44:28) an axiom is something which you consider to be a self-evident truth that's what an axiom means correct okay so this
(44:35) would be an axiom right to them it's self-evident but you go to a different culture it's not self-evident 100% yeah
(44:42) exactly 100% right like so then these are not objective truths then they're subjective truths sure yeah so if it's
(44:48) subjective if these are subjective truths that we're leaning into um then when you say no no I go off of an
(44:55) objective truth which is the constitution you don't actually you go off of a subjective truth which you use your identitarian prism in order to say
(45:03) no I actually believe that these rights are inalienable not just axiomatic but they're justified on God himself that
(45:11) would be the core of your identitarianism sure okay so you're saying there is no
(45:17) woke right because everybody has identity at least on the identitarian front so you can make your So your
(45:23) argument that only on the identitarian front would I make this case your argument that I could use against you is there's no woke left either no well when
(45:30) we say woke on the left we're talking about what is woke on the left yeah so that would be intersectional politics
(45:37) which is based specifically on elevating specifically elevating
(45:44) um one victim class over another victim class that's woke right yeah but it's
(45:49) not though and I'm going to explain why but I'll I'll I'll give the counter too for each one of these definitions for how it applies to woke left and
(45:57) intersectionality but not the right who rejects intersectionality all of them in fact uh kind of categorically reject
(46:04) intersectionality but that doesn't mean that they don't have to play within the purview of the left so imagine it this
(46:09) way politically so So when you and I are debating we both have a distinct
(46:14) worldview right like it's a distinct way that we view the world the if the left
(46:20) views the entire world through intersectionality when you're talking to them you're talking about them through that view that's all that they
(46:26) understand is that view so if you destroy their arguments you're destroying them inside of that view of the left that's what you're doing so if
(46:34) people force intersectionality woke leftists force intersectionality on the right then the right has every right to
(46:41) reduce that to rubble by saying "Oh if that's the case that we're doing people group elevation we should also be able
(46:47) to elevate whichever people group we decide should be elevated." You're using their worldview as a weapon against them
(46:54) that is not you purposely adopting this as some type of precept for your ideology it's a way to reduce their
(47:01) ideology to [ __ ] rubble do you understand oh by over by using their own
(47:07) right their own hyperfixation on intersectionality then the woke right is using their own hyperfixation on
(47:14) intersectionality to to sort of reduce their argument and ele which turns them
(47:19) into woke right no they wouldn't be woke right still well they wouldn't they wouldn't actually follow the same concept so it would be like this they do
(47:25) a kid says a kid says "That oven's not hot." And I say "Yes it is you're going to burn your hand if you touch it." And
(47:31) uh-uh I won't and you say "Well go ahead touch it." And they touch it and they burn their hand you're like "Ha haha
(47:36) Andrew look at that." You're guilty just like him of thinking that the oven was
(47:42) you know what I mean it's It makes no sense it's like look because when you go inated when you go
(47:47) into uh people who identify in identity politics we're we have to agree that all
(47:52) of us are hyperfocused on identity politics there's no way around it when you say a victim mentality right do you
(47:59) think that it's legitimate that like don't you agree that there is a lot of actual victims who are white who have
(48:06) been victimized by the DEI of the left like that's a legitimate grievance isn't it yeah they they would argue this the
(48:12) woke left would argue the same thing of Yeah but you're using their view yeah the thing is is that the woke left is is
(48:18) speaking from [ __ ] like the woke left uses past injustices and now they
(48:25) think because of past injustices that now they need um to change you know they
(48:32) need uh equity now because the reason why I say black people aren't where I
(48:38) don't know aren't as more successful as they are or what have you is because of all the past injustices so now we need
(48:45) equity to not only hold white people back but to push uh minorities and such
(48:52) that's different than what Andrew is saying about the gropers being reactionary because they are reacting to
(48:59) this active campaign by the woke left to hold them back and to oppress them and
(49:06) so now they're fighting back against it that's the difference between the gropers and the woke to point out that
(49:13) by your view your view woke leftist the grievances that you would hold in racial
(49:19) categories we also would have a stake in by your metrics and you're proving my point that's not a proof of your points
(49:25) a proof of the rejection of the ideology only they're not engaging in it they're
(49:30) just pointing out the absurdity of it no but then they they they do engage in it they talk about how white people white
(49:36) people are oppressed you just said it right white people are oppressed identity politics with a hyperfixation
(49:42) on race this is what the Groper movement is basically all about white people are victims because of some some magical
(49:50) mystical figure out there these Jewish controlled [ __ ] space lasers that are and like Nick Fuentes went on Alex Jones
(49:57) and said if all Jewish people were were transported to the moon the world's
(50:02) problems would go away right you telling me that that's not a hyperfixation on identity politics and intersectionality
(50:09) i think it's a hyperfocus on identity politics i just don't think that any particular group uh has any pass on
(50:17) hyperfocusing on identity politics why so like from your view I have a better word for this would be reactionary so
(50:25) these guy these groups all call themselves reactionary fuentes and the Gypers call themselves reactionaries
(50:30) actually makes sense because if they're saying "Look you're imposing X on us
(50:36) we're reacting to that by doing the ex by by showing you the exact same behavior back and you don't like it."
(50:43) Bro exactly they are doing exactly what you're saying we are going to act woke against you then that would be
(50:49) reactionary not woke right so we're saying the same thing no they're not holding the same set of beliefs that's
(50:54) the That's the delineation so here let me maybe I can do it in analogy but you just said but you just said you just
(51:01) said the woke left is one victim class over the other what the groper racial
(51:07) racial categorized victim classes which need to have grievances which they don't
(51:13) even have addressed then then you have that on both sides of No you don't you actually really don't so the idea of
(51:19) racial grievance really only comes in as a form of internal critiques what I'm trying to explain to you it's like let's pretend for a second you had a prison
(51:26) where the prisoners didn't want to eat [ __ ] but every single day the prison guards put a piece of [ __ ] on their
(51:33) plate right and said "You have to eat it." One day the prisoners riot and they take it over the next day right they
(51:41) force the prison guards to eat [ __ ] and the prison guards are like "Fuck I really don't like this." And they're like "See yeah that sucks doesn't it?"
(51:46) Right the prisoners themselves are not adopting the ideology that you should eat [ __ ] that was the ideology of the
(51:53) guards they're just showing the problems in the presentation that's the same exact thing you would do against any
(51:59) proponents if your ideology tried to force it on you as a form protest well then the argument for the woke left
(52:05) would be we were treated poorly under slavery and we're reactionary so that no they they consider themselves the
(52:11) opposite they consider themselves to be progressive not reactionary non-reactionary so they're progressing
(52:17) by using intersectionality the right-wing is reacting to the quote
(52:23) progress by showing by holding up a mirror and saying "Look if it is the case that you want to make everything
(52:29) intersectional and break down every single people group and this and that that also can be utilized in our favor
(52:35) against you but it does not mean that that's a core of their ideology cuz it's not it's a weapon." Yeah no yeah except
(52:42) slavery ended like a long ass time ago and they're reacting to it now like
(52:48) what that doesn't make any sense that's not reactionary that's just trying to find something to be a victim about
(52:55) where the gropers are at least reacting to something that's going on now the never ending cycle because it's
(53:00) basically somebody is always going to come back in this reactionary thing the left is going to say we're progressive
(53:06) not reactionary but we're reacting to we're reacting to Well they're not re they're never reactionary that's why
(53:12) they don't call themselves that no the the main tenant of the woke left is reaction bro they hold all institutional
(53:17) power what are they reacting to if I can add in I think the you know the question
(53:22) is whether the woke right exists or not but but I don't know if I don't know if
(53:28) it matters whether it's right or not in terms of the the reactionary versus not
(53:33) reactionary identification yeah i mean it matters and here's why it matters when we're talking about if this people
(53:40) so like if I said So here's what Misfit Patriots doing it's a It's a word categorization fallacy and here's what's
(53:46) going on if I say no to a trans person you can't be a woman they say "No no no
(53:53) you're saying I don't exist you're trying to erase my identity." Right you're trying to erase who I am cuz you
(54:00) claim that that's not not what it is here I'm actually doing I'm doing the same type of criticism i'm saying no
(54:06) what you're pointing to as being the woke right right as a like behavioral set actually here doesn't make any sense
(54:14) the word reactionary in its place would actually make sense it would be reacting to things which are pushed on them
(54:20) rather than adopting this ideology as being one that's correct so like if these guys got power they're not going
(54:26) to impose intersectionality that's ridiculous so it's not their ideology
(54:32) they argue for white we already have a name for these people that he's talking about it's the Gropers that's it i I believe it used they used to be called
(54:38) like the outright right that used to be the old name for them outright now it's the Gropers um but pretty much same
(54:45) thing but now he's trying to label them the woke right which it it doesn't apply
(54:50) it's not the same thing i could think as I as I demonstrated demonstrated earlier in this video that Misfit Patriot here I
(54:57) think is more of woke right than the people he's trying to describe and that he's trying to tone police he's trying
(55:03) to tell people who they could uh be platform who they could have conversations with and not with um also
(55:12) too he he's pointing out all the the the the violent rhetoric supposedly that the
(55:18) woke right spew and stuff like that um same thing that the woke left used to do
(55:24) or will still do actually uh they're also trying to label a group of people like the woke right because they're
(55:30) trying to ostracize them he even admitted it like he's trying to find the people in this and kind of uh uh uh
(55:36) alienate them again you don't have to do that you already have the gropers just call them the gropers and everyone knows
(55:42) who you're talking about and also too if I might add I think the
(55:49) people that are calling for like uh who are let's say okay with the possibility of uh Donald Trump uh of the government
(55:58) right now limiting anti-semitism and stuff taking that into law and such i
(56:04) think the people that are pro that I think are more woke right because that's the same type of thing the woke left
(56:10) would have done uh you have the people saying that oh
(56:15) you know like the whole Douglas Marie Dave Smith thing about oh if you're not an expert then maybe you shouldn't be
(56:21) talking about this type of deal that maybe you shouldn't be maybe you're not qualified enough you're not a
(56:27) professional enough to talk about this same thing that the woke left used to do i'm just saying listen I think that
(56:33) Andrew is wrong on this and that his argument is there is no woke right i think there is a woke right but I don't
(56:41) think it's Andrew i don't think it's the Gropers or who Misfit Patriot is trying
(56:46) to paint as the woke right i think it's people like James Lindsay and even to a lesser extent Misfit Patriot even if
(56:53) he's not as extreme as James Lindsay uh I still think he is a part of the woke right ideology the liberal right if you
(57:01) will and I think that's who the real woke right is because I think they share
(57:06) more in common with the woke left than the Gropers if you want to see the full debate I have a link in the description
