(2:17) [Music]
(2:35) and good evening everyone I am Sarah the Raging tomato here bringing to you live
(2:41) the debate between Andrew Wilson and Undead chronic our topic this evening is stepdads are cuck holds I didn't make it
(2:48) up I just post it um I'm here pulling scraps from the bottom of the barrel so
(2:53) here we are live uh for clarification purposes I reached out to both of these gentlemen I saw that there was um some
(3:00) spattle going between the two of them so I decided to see if they wanted to do this and I decided to host it so here we
(3:07) are um I do have uh two big Rules of Engagement for this evening and uh I
(3:13) want to make sure I clarify them I'm well aware we have two very big personalities two very big voice voices
(3:21) on one screen one rule I have as you can yell and cuss at each other all you want
(3:26) the only thing I ask is you don't do it over each other if I have to intervene it's going to be because the audience
(3:32) cannot hear anything that either of you are saying that will be the one and only time I will intervene in terms of that
(3:38) concept the other rule I have is that uh there are I recognize this is a personal
(3:44) lifestyle attack no big deal I understand it however one thing that I won't allow on screen is attacking
(3:51) children children are to be left completely out of this or any form of doxine of any sort it's a big no no not
(3:58) only on YouTube but in my personal principles as well if we attack children I just remove from the screen take my
(4:05) ball and go home and we call it a day that's going to be how that is um we are
(4:10) going to start with four minute openings and end on four minute closings uh Undead chronic will have the first uh
(4:18) opening statement seat since he is the Challenger and then Andrew will close us first uh this debate will go no l no
(4:25) later than 6:40 as far as the arguments are concerned uh then we will close it down and end on closing statements and
(4:32) then I will go into Super chats read and respond Undead chronic and Andrew Wilson are both welcome to stay and answer to
(4:38) those uh I will not be hosting any form of open Panel after this event however
(4:44) if you are doing a live uh Afterparty reaction stream please feel free to check in with our mods they're happy to
(4:50) drop your links a uh at the end of the show and we're happy to redirect in that
(4:55) in that aspect um gentlemen do you agree with everything being said this evening
(5:01) Andrew to you yeah I agree Undead chronic to you if the kids are 18 can I
(5:06) bring them up or no no kids at all no kids at all and what family members no
(5:11) no family members um I will say Rachel is kind of in since she is in the public light I think that would be kind of
(5:18) she's a public figure she as far as any additional family members now if you're smart enough you can speak an abstract
(5:25) and get through this argument and make points outside of that um but however bringing up people personally actual
(5:32) names or any specific I don't even know their names don't worry about that that would be great um I think you can do
(5:38) this in abstract or in a generalization and get through the argument respectfully and actually make your
(5:44) points I think you can do it just uh just just jump on me early if I'm crossing that line okay just stay out of
(5:51) the personal realm that's all I ask um do you agree to all of that I I sure
(5:57) okay any final questions gentlemen no all right Undead chronic I leave it to
(6:02) you to open cool there is a mountain it's called cuck Mountain he who sits at
(6:09) the top of cuck mountain is Mr Jack Murphy actual cuckold people who watch
(6:15) their wives engage in sexual activities with other people why is cucking bad why
(6:22) do men not like to be cucked because you're giving up access to your sexual
(6:28) resources to other right there are levels of cucking everybody here listening is a cuck if
(6:35) you pay taxes to the federal government right unfortunately you all get cued that way because your money gets sent to
(6:42) single mothers and their bassroom kids through welfare through whatever it is I would argue that a man who marries
(6:51) a single mother is higher on cuck Mountain than someone who says I want to
(6:57) have my own children and spend all my resources on my own children that's pretty much
(7:04) it okay um I put the Florida
(7:10) Andrew that's that really that's it that's all you wanted to do
(7:16) there okay am I supposed to respond or no I I was just just making sure no no
(7:21) yeah yeah pretty much so uh as expected this uh I think that this is just going
(7:26) to be a kind of routine hater debate I actually rather enjoy these more than any other type because my haters really
(7:32) don't know very much about me at all and basically just make assumptions or reuse old attacks which have already been
(7:38) addressed a hundred times uh the fact they get so much wrong obviously amuses me but the attacks usually center around
(7:43) my wife or kids it doesn't really have anything to do with what I say but rather who I chose to marry and have
(7:49) kids with the topic of this debate is going to be centered around uh of course
(7:55) uh is being a stepfather cuckoldry now a person can create any definition of the word cuckle re they like I think that we
(8:01) just saw Undead chronic do that for instance um but it does need to point to
(8:07) a category and that category should contain information which is coherent the emology of the word cockled comes
(8:12) from Middle English cuck weld from old French cwal from the cuckoo bird the
(8:18) equivalent words in French and other languages apply to both the bird and the adulterer cuckold has never been applied
(8:23) to the bird in the English language for instance and that's where some of the nebulousness of the term comes from Shakespeare another playw writers
(8:30) popularized the term because all rights in the name were perineal uh from father to son so peasants Nobles monarchs alike
(8:37) had a very real fear of being cuckolded which meant their wife would cheat and they'd end up raising and siring a child
(8:43) not their own unknowingly thus if ever later revealed it could topple entire Noble lines and in the past that
(8:50) actually has happened the word has evolved to include men who want to watch other men have sex with their
(8:56) significant other he mentioned Jack Murphy I think that's a good example uh wife girlfriend whatever but this has
(9:02) only been a recent inclusion as a pornographic category and it describes essentially the same behavior just in
(9:08) the style of fetish where now the man is fetishizing not knowing if the child is his or not this is by far the most
(9:15) common use of the word in modernity what most people mean when they say it the theme Crossover with the itology makes
(9:22) perfect sense because in both cases the meaning is defaulting to not knowing if your Offspring is actually yours
(9:29) a stepfather or mother on the other hand doesn't fit that criteria as paternity isn't what is in question Joseph the
(9:36) husband of Mary for instance was stepfather to Jesus Christ if we were to use Undead chronics definition here or
(9:42) use uh any of the word cuckle that the way he says it we would have to blaspheme and say God cuckle to Joseph
(9:50) which makes zero sense as in that sense then every man on planet Earth would be acked by this logic as a thing which
(9:56) makes us us is created by the Divine God and it's called the soul also there are further logical issues if we extrapolate
(10:03) this to adopt also would be cuckoldry as adoption and step parenting is essentially essentially the same concept
(10:10) in fact in the days of old to be married to a woman with children was to adopt those children the basic idea is that
(10:16) Offspring which aren't yours you are willing to provide resources for and love them rendering aid to any child in
(10:22) fact would be cuckoldry as a sharing of your resources with a child would be exactly what a [ __ ] or cockled is doing
(10:28) by being a step parent but there's actually more if a woman has children who are adults and no longer
(10:33) live with her is The Stepfather still a cuckold he isn't sharing any resources at all for instance what about if a
(10:39) woman pays all the bills and takes care of all the responsibilities and not the man would he still be a cuckle if the
(10:45) issue is that uh his meaning of the word is that a cuckle is a man who sleeps with a woman who has children from
(10:52) another man that also presents logical issues for instance what if she's a widow is he still a cuckle what if the
(10:58) woman was pregnant with multiple babies but aborted them all is he still a cuckle if the answer to any of these is
(11:05) yes The Logical extension is that just sleeping with a woman who has slept with any other man but you makes you a
(11:10) cuckold which would likely include most of my audience and his also what if she
(11:16) gave another dude a [ __ ] before you were with her is that still cuckoldry I'm interested in a good faith debate on
(11:22) this uh though I don't think I'll get one I'm still going to try to though ultimately it was pretty clear to me
(11:27) that Undead doesn't really know very much about me or my content and rather defers to what other people say which I
(11:33) think he should know better than to do I never had any actual issues with a guy but he seems to have some with me my
(11:38) guess is that this will basically just be kind of a personal insult character attack we won't really get into the
(11:44) topic very much with that my opening is done all right the floor is open
(11:49) gentlemen so if a man watches Another Man impregnate his wife and willingly
(11:56) raises the kid he knows the kid isn't his is he not not a cuckle yeah he would be if he's getting enjoyment or
(12:02) entertainment from watching another man impregnate his wife yeah okay okay yeah
(12:07) so adoption that's a very interesting point well hang on can we stay on the on the first point yeah sure yeah say so to
(12:14) to start with that you wouldn't disagree with me that a man who would get enjoyment and not just their wife
(12:19) girlfriend whatever uh from watching another man have sex with their significant other whoever that was would
(12:25) be a cockle right yeah that's probably the peak that's the you know think of
(12:30) cuckle yeah would you agree with me that if you were to ask maybe walk down the street and ask a thousand people what
(12:35) cuckold meant that that would be the meaning most of them thought it meant probably yes yeah okay all right yeah
(12:41) yeah we can go to topic too yeah so for adoption you're giving resources to
(12:47) another man's child yep yeah it's probably somewhere on cuck Mountain I don't see it as bad as you know marrying
(12:54) a single mother willingly giving your now now I do I do have an audio clip of
(12:59) you saying that you would be willing to adopt yeah well that kind of changes that's some
(13:04) flux but if I mean if you would be willing to adopt are you then admitting that you would be willing to be a cuckold well I have to pay taxes so I'm
(13:11) forced to be a cuckold on that on that yeah but even if we're going to use a tier I so let me kind of reject a couple
(13:17) categories I would say that forced coercion wouldn't make you a cuckold so for instance if like men broke into your
(13:23) house on dead chronic and they they were like holding your wife no and they held you right at at you know at gunpoint and
(13:31) then they did things to your wife in front of you I don't think that that would make you a cuckold because that was coercion and force I think that
(13:38) there has to be like a um you know some type of participation in the watching and viewing right yes yeah so I I don't
(13:46) think that taxes for instance if you're if you're making the statement that that's done under under coercion which
(13:52) I'm I'm sure you would I don't think that would make a person a cuckle right but if a man gets cucked and doesn't
(13:57) know about it he didn't sent to it and he's raising another man's kids he's still cucked yeah well I think that
(14:03) that's the emology of the word is I would agree with you so if if your wife stepped out got pregnant and then you
(14:10) unknowingly raised that kid I would agree that that's cuckle G yes so I would agree that that's the Baseline
(14:15) emology and that watching another man have sex with your girl on purpose would also fit that emology so I don't think
(14:22) consent really really affects whether someone's getting cucked well I think that consent is the whole basis for it
(14:29) because you're not consenting to raise the kid that isn't yours you don't know it so you're otherwise you would retract
(14:35) consent if you did know that was the whole point like that was the whole point right so if a king had a had like
(14:41) a queen and she decided to like [ __ ] The Bard and she got Brant by The Bard uh
(14:46) and then she had the kid he unknowingly raised that kid uh that he would be cuckolded right so but if he had known
(14:53) he would retract consent but today we have cuckle to consent and so I think
(14:59) that that's the pornographic um like the the the pornographic idea of it and the
(15:05) porn industry coined that term and yeah I would agree that that fits the emology of the word because it's they're
(15:11) fetishizing that happening to them so I I do think that people can get cucked with or without their consent
(15:17) like I'm getting cucked I don't want to be cucked by paying taxes but I'm getting cucked yeah but why if if it's done
(15:26) through coercion I don't understand that that's like saying so like for instance if a woman were to be you know like you
(15:33) know Ed for instance wouldn't you wouldn't hold that against her like she didn't there was nothing she did right
(15:39) she was just like jogging down the street and that happened to her um you wouldn't say that that's a sex partner
(15:44) right you would say that that was like this horrible thing that happened without her consent right sure but it was still a sexual activity yeah I
(15:50) wouldn't disagree that that there was sex involved in it I'm just saying that uh I think I think that what makes that
(15:57) the essay is the consent and I think that that would be the same thing with cuckoldry that both both types are based
(16:03) around consent either consent to watch the woman do this or uh no consent to
(16:08) raising the other child yeah so there's levels to the cuck mountain and consent
(16:14) is not really you can't say I didn't consent I didn't get cucked you can't say I consent I didn't get cucked
(16:19) consent doesn't really doesn't really determine whether or not you're getting cucked well I think it if if you were to
(16:25) instance um if you were to find out that um uh or or you had wanted your wife to
(16:33) screw another guy and get pregnant that wouldn't fit the idea of cuckoldry at
(16:39) least not the the base word of cuckoldry because the whole idea there is I did not consent to this and you made it
(16:45) cockled out of me right I'm now raising a child that is not mine um and I
(16:50) assumed that it was I think it's the consent issue that is the big issue yeah
(16:56) I'd still call him a cuck I still think that fits a Spirit of the word now we got these old definitions you got new
(17:03) definitions you have oh well it was this here some birds I think most men would
(17:08) agree letting your wife get pregnant willingly from another dude is some cck [ __ ] yeah I
(17:15) agree I wouldn't disagree with that okay so when I did my opening statement you
(17:20) said there was a lot of similar arguments attacks haterade whatever it was and I don't know you I don't know
(17:26) you where was I wrong because I don't want to be wrong if I say married a single mother and that wasn't true no
(17:31) that's true that's true I did I did marry a single mother I'm not sure how that um relates to cuckle unless if if
(17:38) all you're saying here is that is that uh all of us are cucks to some degree
(17:44) and I'm just in some kind of higher tier of cuck than you are even though you're also a
(17:49) cuck then I mean it just it just doesn't seem like it's um that it's an argument
(17:54) with Merit really well I'm I'm trying to say that higher level cucks shouldn't be telling young men how to live their
(18:00) lives well I don't tell anybody how to live their life you don't preach you don't no I have no Ministry of
(18:07) whatsoever oh well that's an attack okay sorry about that yeah what do you do mostly beside because I've only seen you
(18:12) attacking hookers online oh from whatever yeah like whatever Clips yeah so I go on whatever that started a few
(18:19) months ago I go on anytime they ask me to guest on there and sometimes we have interesting conversations and sometimes
(18:25) debates break out occasionally they're theological in nature but um like my rule is not to ever give advice even
(18:32) though people DM me for it all the time I literally tell them I don't give advice it's a bad idea to give people advice because I don't know anybody's
(18:38) personal situation and I feel like I could actually give somebody the wrong advice and it would lead them the wrong
(18:43) way and then I would be to blame for that yeah that's a tricky situation I
(18:48) mean I'll give advice but it's stuff like uh no hman no diamond don't marry a single mother go to the gym very basic
(18:54) stuff that's all good advice yeah but if some you know someone will call in like yo chronic I got this
(19:00) girl we've been dating for 5 years I love her but she has body count of three should I know how no diamond ye out of
(19:06) there it's like look bro that's your life man I'm not gonna tell you to do to to do that I'm saying this is what so I
(19:12) mean but doesn't that kind of get to a lot of the core of the issue too which is every single situation is going to be
(19:18) different and while I agree with you um I agree with you that probably a woman
(19:23) who is chased and who is a virgin would probably be optimal for most men there's
(19:28) less baggage there's less all kinds of things but you know these guys who are in their 30s or in their 40s they have
(19:34) they all have different situations and not every woman who's a single mom is a bad person though I will admit that the
(19:39) rate of women who become single moms on purpose has now caused significant problems in regards to feminism um but
(19:47) like every Situation's going to be different so it's very difficult even for you to um to kind of broad uh broad
(19:54) brush it any more than me that's why you probably take it on a situation by situation basis
(19:59) yeah I think when it comes to a single mother I would always say no but people what if she was a like
(20:05) what if she was a widow no no because there's a woman up there without kids yeah that's true but like what if
(20:11) the guy what you know like modern women what I learned from whatever going on there so much is that modern women
(20:18) [ __ ] suck and it doesn't necess it doesn't necessar matter agree with you yeah like it
(20:25) doesn't really even seem to matter uh they have kids they don't have kids this
(20:30) and that like they're all kind of entitled obnoxious brats uh for the most
(20:35) part very um very ungrateful brats and um you know the thing is is like I'm not
(20:42) so sure that even advising even if the woman has no kids she probably had four abortions right it's like I don't it's
(20:49) hard to it's hard to give anybody advice and the dating Market is completely [ __ ] I wouldn't even know what to do with it like if I was one of these
(20:55) pickup artists I'd probably just give up dude oh yeah you know um so funny thing
(21:00) you tweet you uh dm' me you said something like I the date got canceled and he said debate I thought of the
(21:06) pickup artists I beef with in the past these dudes would legit sell a spot for a streamyard date and so some supporter
(21:13) would would get on the streamyard and they have a a date with some probably only fans girl for like 30 minutes and
(21:20) then the next two hours would be four pickup artists like ripping the guy apart on how we didn't whole frame and
(21:25) so when you said that I CU I know you didn't do it that was some funny [ __ ] in my mind yeah well I've seen um I I've
(21:32) actually uh debated with a lot of pickup artists debated with Destiny Matt Dillan Hunty a lot of the bigger debate names I
(21:39) only actually go on whatever occasionally but I mostly do debates with highle personalities um those are obviously a
(21:45) lot more fun to do uh like for instance I the the way I found out about you was when you were kind of uh just going at
(21:52) Hunter Avalon which I thought was [ __ ] hilarious right um you know I was the one who broke that story I broke
(21:59) that story on the uh on the hunter avalone thing I was the one yeah that his wife was doing this
(22:05) with all these dudes yeah yeah that was gross yeah Kingston emailed me but I was like I'm not sure if this is legit Andor
(22:13) legal so I just I let it I'll let it sit my emo box then he made the video the next day yeah yep yep that was uh that
(22:20) was [ __ ] wild but yeah I mean for the yeah go ahead s did you see Hunter avalone on Twitter begging for donations
(22:26) to get shared custody yeah yeah yeah I did well actually I tweeted about it it's like because it
(22:34) was really funny he had this tweet that went out with um he he had done a debate with Fuentes and he was like I'm over
(22:40) here living the Trad life right and so I tweet up I put that tweet up side by
(22:45) side with his I need money I need money for custody well part of me wants to feel
(22:52) bad for him but just how he's acted over the years it's I I like to see it I like
(22:58) I'd like to see leftist cuckolds well he got cucked but he's not a willing cuck I
(23:03) like to see leftists get destroyed by the family court in public yeah well I you know the thing is though is maybe I
(23:10) have different motivations for that I'd prefer to see them come over to our side so the leftists they're not stupid right
(23:17) they're just misguided and I think uh I think when [ __ ] like that happens and they suddenly have to engage in the real
(23:23) world and real world consequences they begin to move away from that more into the right-wing sphere
(23:29) okay can I interrupt gentlemen I feel like you guys should be cracking a beer open and just barbecuing
(23:37) or something this has turned into like a nice conversation you found a lot of agreement
(23:42) points well a lot of people when they get invited to a debate or discussion
(23:47) they'll watch some of my content because my content like when I'm streaming or I'm making response videos very costic
(23:54) very toxic um but when I want to have a when someone's willing to have a conversation with me I'm not going to
(24:00) just call them a a goddamn cuckle and laugh at it I I still think marrying a single mother makes someone more of a
(24:06) cuckle than not but it's like what are we gonna do am I gonna repeat my arguments five times he's gonna do and
(24:13) then I gonna get angry and call a CU booy then that's not really productive in my mind yeah I would I would still
(24:20) say though um the the the problem if you have a word which alludes to this this um this
(24:27) idea of [ __ ] and it just means basically anybody doing anything to you that you just
(24:33) don't want them to do to you then that just basically makes everybody on planet Earth a
(24:38) cuckold yeah well I like to use cuck andry would I call you a cuckold no when
(24:45) I say you are you marrying a single mother is engaging in cocket tre yes I
(24:50) would um but if I was getting taxed that would be cuck atry oh yeah well it's a different level of catry right we're
(24:57) getting we're all getting cucked by the government yeah but I mean how do we ascertain what the levels here are isn't
(25:02) it is she just kind of using intuition for this like much feel I feel like this is more more cuckle this is why when I
(25:09) when I use itology I'm trying to look at the root of the word and I'm trying to discern what category it goes in so
(25:15) every word's going to point to a meaning and a category so if we use the word we're pointing to the meaning in the
(25:20) category it seems like it's very much sexual and is very much related to offspring but if we just kind of take
(25:26) that emology away and say just anything anybody ever does against your will is
(25:31) cocket Tre uh then I I think that we've just lost what the word meaning is yeah
(25:36) I think calling someone a cuck or saying they are engaging in cry is not the same
(25:42) as saying they're a cuckold cuckold I like to reserve for you know the Murphy's okay so okay so let me let me
(25:49) make sure I got it right then so cockled we would agree is going to be like Jack Murphy he's a cockled and we would agree
(25:56) like a king who raised a that The Bard had actually sired and he
(26:01) there was no paternity test that would be a cuckle too so we have those two things would be cuckles yes but you know
(26:06) it's when it comes to what's worse it's like cuck Tre is like temperature everything has a temperature okay it's a
(26:13) scale you know just because I say um you know this table has a temperature of what 72 degrees doesn't mean that ice
(26:20) doesn't also have a temperature yeah I agree with that it's more of like a I think C I see cucker Tre is more it
(26:26) seems to me like it's just two categories we're talking about different categories so when we say cockled we're both agreeing on what that category is
(26:32) and then when we say catry your definition of catry is basically anything uh which is done to you the
(26:40) person that uh you didn't want done to you that would be I would I would say it's
(26:46) any transfer of resources from a manh to another man's Offspring that's
(26:53) what I would say so like okay so really though because like if you're let's say you're a so in a foreign war and you
(26:59) give a kid a candy bar that's catry then that's a good point let me think
(27:05) let me think of a a better because is there is a sexual nature of it right yeah I think there has to be I think
(27:10) there has to donating you know like donating to like some food Aid donating
(27:16) for I don't know like shoes to some homeless kid that's obviously not catry right so like and in like if you if you
(27:22) were to go back to Old Roman Empire when they like let kids die of exposure and you rolled out if you if you had a time
(27:29) machine you went back and you like saved that kid from dying you wouldn't call that cocket Tre right no but I would say
(27:35) if you married a woman with a bunch of kids and you raised those kids and you spent your life's energy raising those
(27:42) kids instead of having more of your own kids that's catry what if you did
(27:47) both both as in like raising someone marrying raising someone else's kids and donating and you had your own and had
(27:54) your own mhm then you're less i' say you're less cut than someone that didn't have any of their own but compared to
(28:00) the version of you that had all your own children you're more cucked than that version is okay so uh when we're talk so
(28:07) when we're talking about citry then we're going to we we can at least exclude some categor so like just
(28:13) providing resources for kids that aren't yours isn't going to fall under that category because that wouldn't make sense yeah a soldier giving a candy bar
(28:18) to a kid in a war zone is not going to be we're not going to consider that cry at all yeah I would say if it's if it's
(28:24) not at the expense of your own children or future children yes it's not catry okay so then the Widow argument would
(28:30) stand so then if um if a Widow died and her children died let's say before you
(28:36) met her there would be no allocation of resources so that could not be cocky so what are you doing with this
(28:43) Widow because she's dead just necro no no no no she's the Widow okay there's a
(28:49) widow and her kids had died and Di and her husband died yeah oh and the kids
(28:54) well then you're not transferring any resources to her kids because they're dead so that's not
(29:02) catry I'd say it's not overt catry I think anything worse than anything
(29:08) that's not nohman no diamond on some level is a little bit cuish yes I think that is but
(29:15) it because you married a widow I wouldn't yeah so so even sleeping with a
(29:20) woman who slept with a with a a man before you you're still a [ __ ] if you're giving her money and providing for her
(29:27) it's worse no h no diamond so the only way essentially somebody would not be
(29:32) practicing catry is if they married a virgin yeah but yeah I'd say that but
(29:38) you're still getting taxed but willingly participating willingly doing everything you can you're willingly like marrying a
(29:44) chick who has slept with like seven guys that's that's some seasoning of
(29:49) cuck flakes on top yeah so that's cck tree yeah it's Joseph by this but by
(29:56) that logic though Joseph who is The Stepfather of God would be a
(30:01) [ __ ] sure you I mean you are I think you're a
(30:07) Christian right yeah but I'm not I'm not attacking Joseph for being a cuckle he
(30:12) he consented to raising the father of God and I'm not comparing people who marry single mothers to a dude whose
(30:19) wife gave birth to a messiah yeah that's yeah but he didn't know he didn't know
(30:24) that that was the Messiah first so she came she came from a v um and was
(30:30) betrothed to him and was pregnant before she knew that that was the Messiah didn't an angel tell him it going to be
(30:36) the yeah but she he had already known she was pregnant by that time yeah sure
(30:41) I'd say that so he so he's a you think he's a [ __ ] he's higher on the mountain of
(30:48) catry than a man who didn't consent or the man who didn't
(30:53) have to raise this Immaculate Conception yeah so I mean again I think I think that we
(31:00) just have to category ER so I think we agree on the first category of what a cuckold is and I think that the second
(31:06) category is um this kind of this word you came up with of catry which
(31:11) essentially just kind of alludes to anything in which a man is utilizing resources as you described um towards
(31:19) other people's children but there's then caveats to that where okay not in a war
(31:24) zone though or not if you like find them on the ground and there's no parents around even though You' be raising the
(31:29) kid then not for adoption so it's not really clear to me what the criteria for catry is it's a fun word right like I'm
(31:35) gonna use it now I'm totally I'm steing it and I'm using it because it's a fun word but I I'm just
(31:43) I'm not clear I'm still not really clear everything that would go in that category as all do you think do you
(31:49) think any of your children are the Messiah no probably probably not yeah I would say no um you willingly chose a
(31:57) woman with man's kids yep to marry and have kids with and give resources to raise those kids yeah that's true that
(32:03) is a much higher level of catry than a man who was told by an Angel that his
(32:08) wife is pregnant with the Messiah yeah and I get it but it's still just going to fit under this criteria of catry
(32:14) whether there's different levels of like I would say there's different levels of essay you could say there's different levels of essay there like penetrative
(32:20) non-penetrative um some which are likely far more horrible than others this type of thing but it's all going to fall under the same category and I'm just not
(32:28) clear everything that would fall under this category of cry so if you say Okay
(32:33) stepfathers going to fall under that okay why well because you're giving resource someone else's kids it's like
(32:38) okay but I can give you many many examples of people giving resources to other people's kids where that doesn't fall under catry and you kind of agree
(32:45) with that if the resources that you give away do not inhibit the resources that
(32:51) can go to your own children so you said a lollipop in the war right yeah but I mean that that's
(32:57) still could I mean like if you if you give to a children's do charity you know
(33:03) what I mean that's going to take away resources from your own kids yeah if if your kids are if your kids can't afford
(33:09) you know new shoes and you're donating to give shoes to Inner City kids you are a cuckle yes that's cry too well what if
(33:17) they what if you can't afford it for them and you have a little bit left over but they're not going to like they're
(33:22) not going to get the nicest shoes and then you're going to split those resources and ordinarily they could have nicer but you split the resources and
(33:28) then give that to children's charity is that still catry are we talking like what what kind
(33:35) of shoes we talk about are your kids like using water bottles no no no they they they have like regular serviceable
(33:41) shoes but they're not like they're not really highgrade and you could get them high grade it's just that you choose to
(33:47) get them kind of normal shoes and then split it or you choose to get them like maybe not the nicest toys around and
(33:53) then split it and then give the rest of it to like a children's CH I would say that those that children charity the
(33:58) resources you give to them there's definitely other parts in your child's life that could benefit from those resources besides shoes okay well then
(34:07) let me ask you this um you I I'm I understand that you work in the medical field and um I'm I'm guessing that you
(34:14) have tons and tons of patients who come in who you take care of who have forms of State assistant Medicaid Medicare
(34:21) things like that right yeah let's say I'm not directly involved with the patient care but let's yeah sure
(34:28) okay so you're not you're not like providing the surgeries and this kind of thing but but if you if you were well I don't know I'm making an assumption I
(34:35) don't know you can but but anyway so you're you're providing this Care by the state paying you to do that doesn't that
(34:43) make any of those children you provide the care for cockled by you aren't you basically cucking them I'm cucking the
(34:50) kids by providing Medical Services to them is that what you said yeah because
(34:55) it's coming from the state from no I think that I think the people which is everybody paying taxes to fund Medicare
(35:01) and Medicaid are getting cucked because illegals will go into the hospital and
(35:06) get basically free health care I'm just profiting off of the catry
(35:12) system so you so you're participating in the catry system yeah I mean every you
(35:17) pay taxes you participate I mean I I tend to agree I'm just I'm trying to figure out all of the kind of Dimensions
(35:22) to what catry would entail so if a person were to take their wife
(35:28) um to the hospital let's say yes or I'm sorry let's make it even easier take their their um their kid to the hospital
(35:37) and um and then says okay can you provide care for this kid and then he
(35:43) pays you to provide care for the kid yes is he that's not catry I'm getting paid for a service
(35:50) yeah I know but he if my job is to uh let's say my job is to remove uh wasp
(35:56) Stingers from kids and I'm get paid to do that now another guy is sitting in
(36:01) the ER and he looks over and says oh man that sucks I'm gonna pay that kid's Bill
(36:07) he's a [ __ ] yeah he PID taxes yeah you're you're if you pay taxes you pay
(36:13) for the health care of millions of illegals jump in the border with horrible health problems we're getting cucked by taxes no no I'm saying if if
(36:21) if a if a guy's in the hospital you treat you treat the kid right his kid yes and and he's like oh man this this
(36:29) this copay is killer you know or whatever uh this this bill is killer and somebody in the hospital looks over and
(36:35) says hey you know what man it's around Christmas time I'm gonna pay for that bill he's a [ __ ] does he have kids are
(36:42) kid yeah he has kids yeah do the kids have medical bills that need to be paid well I mean maybe not but any form of
(36:48) resources which he would provide necessarily is going to be resources that his kids aren't going to have right
(36:57) yeah I think it is more cuck than not doing it on the level of cuck Mountain cck a tree right
(37:05) but I don't necessarily think that charity towards someone's kid
(37:13) willingly unless it hurts your like what are the kid it goes on a deeper level like what what is his kids eating are
(37:19) his kids eating modern American food are are there is their hormone system they have they have a healthy diet and this
(37:25) and that but kind of regardless of what their personal circumstances would be whether they were well taken care of or
(37:31) not well taken care of necessarily if this guy takes care of this other kid's bill that is going to be taking
(37:37) resources away from his kids that's like an think of it yeah that is [ __ ] Tre how is his kids gonna buy a house when it's
(37:43) a million dollars for a house he could have taken those resources and put it away yeah so I mean I I don't I don't
(37:48) really think we have much to um I don't even think that we have much in the way
(37:54) to disagree with here if the second criteria for this if cocket Tre is so broad that it would entail even acts of
(38:00) Charity and we're all just kind of cucks then I I guess I just don't give [ __ ] I think on the other end of cuck mountain
(38:06) is self being selfish right because obviously most people would be like hey paying for some kids cancer treatment
(38:13) doesn't make you a cuck I'd say well putting that money away for your kids's house would probably be more useful to
(38:18) the kids and someone like dude you're a selfish [ __ ] I'm like yeah prob yeah I'd agree with that okay well then I
(38:24) guess I guess all of us engage in catry and uh some degree and some and many of them do
(38:30) it on purpose for the purpose of charitability and then we don't really disagree on what a cuckle is so I think
(38:35) I think the debate's been resolved some people will marry a woman with children and I find that a level of cry I would
(38:43) not accept okay I don't really know where to take
(38:48) it from there Sarah I don't
(38:55) need this 40 minutes it wasn't even 40 minutes uh Undead
(39:00) chronic did you ever have any other points of contention I just wouldn't let my son
(39:06) marry a single mother I'd probably strangle him before that that's fair that's fair well I mean
(39:13) gentlemen I don't want to eat up any of more of your time if you're both uh satisfied with the response and and all
(39:19) set we can end on closing statements well I just say it's nice to meet you uh This was um this was kind of a breath of
(39:25) fresh air debate I felt like you were very good faith and answered the questions that I had for you and uh
(39:31) appreciate that I just I think that we're kind of having a semantic argument and I think semantics are important to
(39:36) arguments um and I think that you have just kind of made this category error of
(39:42) a cuckle Dre is X and then catry is y and you fall everybody falls in in some
(39:48) way to this category y but we agree on category X so I mean I don't really if
(39:54) that if that's all it means I guess I just don't have an issue with it think climbing the
(39:59) mountain to go closer to being a cuckold is a bad thing to do and I think you got
(40:04) your Patagonia on and you're hiking and I'm at the bom Mountain like bro stop
(40:09) but I mean at this point it's like dude divorce your wife like that's not that's not gonna you know there's no there's no
(40:16) fix to this it's more young men don't marry single mothers yeah but I wouldn't
(40:21) I don't think that that's bad advice yep that's advice I would generally agree with in fact
(40:27) the the people I see more giving that advice out nowadays than anybody else are single mothers who've been through
(40:32) the the ringer in the system and go wait I really [ __ ] up here so that's uh at
(40:38) least that's the turn that I'm starting to see but you know feminism is entrenched so who knows who knows how it'll go but anyway that's all I have
(40:44) for my closing statement appreciate it uh closing for you Undead chronic man
(40:50) [ __ ] you for making me agree with you sometimes I wanted to yell
(40:58) was that it for you I don't really have anything else it's just lifestyle differences I think that marrying single
(41:05) and I we just had we just talked about it so that's pretty much that's fair
(41:11) well let me well all right guys um I got to get prepared for another podcast
(41:16) tonight Sarah thank you again for having me on your stream I appreciate you doing the leg work for this it was very kind of you you guys have a wonderful night
(41:23) thanks Andrew and Undead if you want to leave as well that's fine and thank you for coming on and
(41:29) entertaining I appreciate it see you
(41:35) bye oh well that went way different than the
(41:42) buildup that came through on that um I feel like I just got
(41:47) [Laughter] cucked but I'm happy because when people
(41:53) can find agreement and without would do it without yelling and screaming at each other or you know going into areas that
(42:01) we don't need to go into uh I have a big appreciation for that so this was good
(42:06) uh so shout out for all the super chats that came in P Fletch dropping by with the $ five sup little Mater uh fairwell
(42:13) to Jack uh coming in with the $2 Andrew give me on advice on how to not give
(42:18) advice thank you so much uh membership rounds uh dropping in the debate that
(42:24) turned into a bromance absolutely uh yes absolutely the debate that turned
(42:31) into a bro like I'm thankful which I kind of felt like they would find a lot more uh agreement than disagreement
(42:38) because a lot of their talking points are similar it was just more of the personal LIF style that they uh that was
(42:45) kind of being attacked here Lauren dropping by with the membership uh did they just become best friends I think
(42:50) they did and I look forward to any further collaboration for them uh in the
(42:56) future because that was great that was awesome and Noah are dropping by with the 50 thank you Noah I thought this was
(43:02) be a was going to be a slugfest but it's turned into a civil conversation really
(43:07) enjoying this yes absolutely I Concur and thank you Noah we appreciate you and
(43:14) Giovani uh with the $ five dud just put St Joseph on the cuck Spectrum
(43:20) excommunicate this toofus yeah that was actually pretty did anybody else appreciate the scale of catry uh I I do
(43:27) feel like we needed a flowchart for this to be able to like really guide it out if I had a like a whiteboard I could
(43:33) start drawing these on I would totally have done it and Ne stopping by with the 699 Undead has solidified himself as an
(43:40) ambassador for cuck Mountain for instigating this and then immediately bending the
(43:47) knee oh that's an interesting take and Flow State dropping by with the $2 is
(43:53) Undead an incel I don't know I'm not sure and the
(43:58) tribe one dropping by with the $2 we're being cucked right now big old
(44:05) cuck we did we all we all
(44:10) failed we all failed this will be fun later to talk about the debate that
(44:16) turned into ah hello Arbiter dropping by with the $2 hey raging burrito Crucible
(44:21) crew showing some love yes I appreciate that Arbiter and dropping by one more
(44:26) time we've all been cocked yes but again this is a good thing I am not even upset
(44:33) I almost because that went so well I kind of almost want to go into open Panel
(44:39) because I pinned out a lot of time I don't know about anybody else um Let
(44:47) me let me give me one
(44:52) second let me do this
(45:25) okay so let's it let's go oh hi heart Bender thank you for dropping by with the five thanks for hosting and hi
(45:32) Lauren yes we all love Lauren I think we should go into open Panel now here's what I'm going to do though I'm going to
(45:38) lay down some Rules of Engagement we're not going to come on and just [ __ ] talk uh either of our panelists that's not
(45:44) going to be the style of the evening we can get on and go through the cult Tre flow chart we can do visuals we can try
(45:52) to figure that out and break it down have the conversation um but we're not going to come on and just start like hate hating
(46:01) anybody that came on whether it's Andrew or Undead chronic that I don't appreciate if you are a new person here
(46:07) and you're coming in from backstage I will have to voice confirm just for the record um you know all of that fun stuff
(46:14) so let's go ahead and do it let's I mean I promised you guys a show and that show
(46:20) turned out to be 40 minutes I feel like they should grab a beer
(46:27) so this is what we're gonna do hi
(46:34) Michelle over there jamming on his channel now I mean have I think it's
(46:40) great I think and if either of them did want to come back uh Arbiter yeah you can s for Andrew all you want
(46:47) I I think sing for other men is okay it's good but thank you for the $2 that
(46:53) was really interesting that was great let's do this since since we have we
(46:58) have to do this let's uh let's let's close out this concept yes and I do want
(47:05) to extend my appreciation I do think that Sarah has been an adequate
(47:10) moderator I think that there's times where she needs to mind her own [ __ ] business in this space but she's been an
(47:16) adequate moderator and I do appreciate her having me on her Channel listen I saw I love you the raising tomato but I
(47:23) would kill myself doing more red pill debates okay the Raging tomato at least
(47:30) she is attempting like she's trying to be a comedian you know she's trying to be
(47:39) funny all right did it play on your end because it was like spotty on my end it did play on my end okay good H
(47:47) that's all I need to know all right well the link has been dropped ladies and gentlemen you're welcome to come on and
(47:54) again I I'm not going to tolerate like we're not going to to just come on and [ __ ] talk anybody we're not going to do
(47:59) that tonight that's that's not the night it's not the type of concept you know when we go into like regular open panels
(48:05) but if anybody has any talking points on the actual topic at hand on cuckle tree
(48:10) all of that we can go into that but I see Lauren's trying to get somebody to get up tml who's who's
(48:20) tml who is tml machine lies oh the machine lies duh I knew that I didn't I
(48:25) knew that um let me debate these chicks we're not here to debate look we put this stuff
(48:32) together and we might give you a cuck writing now I think that should be a thing in face rating should spend all
(48:39) face ratings and go for these cuck ratings because apparently so long as you pay taxes you fall upon the cck
(48:45) rating I think that's fair yeah I think that's fair yeah respect the content
(48:51) thank you arabe man I'm so glad that that happened so well and so
(48:58) briefly yeah grid one what's up G that was super fast oh I've got KN all
(49:05) right now the two of you play nicely yeah
(49:12) okay I'm sorry I couldn't hear anything there for a second oh I said the two of you will
(49:17) play nicely I for sure we're we're cucking the chat
(49:22) today so no fighting we will deny them any
(49:29) entertainment totally cucking the today of any entertainment whatsoever but the the one thing the one thing that I I
(49:36) wanted to add to the discussion is just I I think from whether it's like born of
(49:43) just masculinity as a whole but I think like a lot of men just have this deep
(49:48) fear of their being some element in life um outside of their control that is
(49:55) going to like shame or humiliate them right and so I think like the way we've
(50:00) been using the word [ __ ] or [ __ ] old or all of these things like there's two meanings like we discussed the or Andrew
(50:09) uh did a really good job of laying out the actual uh meaning for the word which I thought was you know really cool and
(50:17) interesting y did we just lose her what what happened did did we lose
(50:25) her audio and her video wait you can hear her that's
(50:32) really loud what's really loud sorry I think uh the Furby is really loud oh I
(50:38) can turn you down furbs um it is I had my Global up because Nev was really
(50:46) low so turn my audio up and we seem to like lost you I don't know if you're mic
(50:51) got unplugged or something okay everyone want to say
(50:57) thank you to Lauren cuz she just sent me an actual chart of
(51:03) catry and I'm going to get it to myself um it's it's kind of Interest oh
(51:10) her mic just cucked her that's what she says um it's interesting because I've actually been having this discussion
(51:16) basically all week over um the um idea
(51:23) of a mandatory paternity test m and so it's been something that's just
(51:28) it seems like the theme of the week um in multiple spheres so um it's very
(51:35) interesting um you know I mean surprisingly there is a
(51:42) statistic in your favor that like 10 different studies find different things but like 10 to
(51:48) 40% of uh women or sorry of men wind up raising a child they don't even own I
(51:54) don't think it's a big deal though cuz like that's technically been going on forever and like if you love that child then that's all that
(52:00) matters yeah I mean I had a stepfather and I'll be honest with you you know it um I never I never actually called him
(52:06) anything but Dad until I was in my late 20s probably so it just didn't matter and I
(52:15) only I think I only did that because it clarified it for my wife when I got married so I guess it was actually
(52:20) in my 30s but I always called him dad and shout out to Arbiter for the extra
(52:25) $2 thank you again win Crucible but tomato you've gained a subscriber well thank you Arbiter um I appreciate that
(52:33) and here it is we've got we've got the cockled ways thank you Lauren everybody
(52:39) say thank you Lauren uh we've got the Voyer cuckold that's your uh Hotel chair we've got the
(52:45) waiting cuckold um the threesome the cuckold threesome the escort wife the
(52:52) [ __ ] cuckle the king I'm not even going to say the of that uh the bisex
(52:59) cuckold uh the fourth one uh dogging waiting cuckold submissive cuckold wife
(53:06) on vacation with her friends at chassid cuold oh my God there's like a whole
(53:11) list that's ridiculous that's crazy aren't some of those things that people just do even without like so I agree
(53:18) with number one and two kind of as like differences like there are definitely some people who like you know watching
(53:24) versus waiting kind of thing but beyond that it's all just seems like you know those are just all just other people's
(53:29) Kinks yeah yeah I know I was like I could play Bingo on that yeah a lot of
(53:35) these are really just Kinks uh I think oh I need to uh pin you were muted GD
(53:40) I'm muted you were you said something and we didn't hear yeah I I spoke really lowly I didn't want it I was it's
(53:50) fine it's fine interesting
(53:56) all right let me place that pin up there there we go now it's pinned wow I don't
(54:02) even know where to go from that that turns out way better than I expected I
(54:08) was really like prepared for this to like um kind of be a little messier than
(54:15) anything um especially with all of the things that were spoken to beforehand
(54:21) and so on and so forth and so I just I wasn't expecting this to be Lauren chin
(54:26) deal right where everybody thought that destroy Lauren chin and they ended up being like buddies
(54:33) wow well hopefully they know exactly went that way but close enough sorry
(54:39) well I mean she liked him enough to use his argument the very next time oh you're talking sorry I thought you meant
(54:44) like the left in general oh yeah no Lauren I don't Lauren Chin's not left leftist
(54:51) no I know at some point like all the leftists wanted to debate her cuz destiny had and she was kind of like
(54:58) courting us or something with being like Oh well I sort of think these policies are cool and I was like I don't buy it I
(55:05) think that's part of her stick though so because she just kind of like
(55:11) seems to be water fit whatever cup but now it doesn't matter because all of her accounts have been destroyed so she's uh
(55:18) no longer in the game that's fair that sucks I recently
(55:24) got targeted by the the mob which mob I don't even know just
(55:32) just a an angry mob really hated the fact that I was a mod on someone's
(55:38) Channel you like that you know what's funny though someone's like oh you're losing your wrench sure you can have the
(55:44) one I took from you back so where one where you lose one one other one pops up and just
(55:51) saying that's fair so grid did you you said you were streaming again last night
(55:56) after you shut down yeah so uh Rachel was
(56:02) debating this um uh Christian I'm not really sure
(56:07) which version um lady I'm I'm obviously probably some sort of
(56:13) protestant and apparently it went
(56:19) badly and uh so she was on X badmouthing Andrew and Rachel
(56:28) like really badly Rachel's his wife right yeah Rachel's his wife super nice
(56:34) super nice lady and um and I don't know I was about to go to bed but I was like
(56:40) you know what I just kind of want to go hear what's being said I like staying up on stuff you know really intend to
(56:46) actually get involved but I ended up getting involved anyway and um basically the
(56:54) um it was a lot of just at it was a lot of AD hom a lot of really weird um
(57:00) insults that don't really mean anything and and I said you know I bet
(57:07) Andrew's online right now like if you really want to if you really have a problem with him you should just address him well and a lot of people were
(57:13) calling her out for doing doing it the way she was you know if if you're a Christian to actually confront the
(57:19) person and not gossip and all of that and um a lot of people were calling
(57:24) around on it and and I I I told her I'm like hey you know I I bet Andrew's on right now I can go look and sure enough
(57:31) he was on he came up and he uh they got into you know they got into it and it it
(57:37) turned into a whole thing I was up till 400 am I was I I was angry enough about being up till 1:00 am um as you know you
(57:45) were there when I was like I gotta go this is I'm I'm up too late I'm an old man and uh so I was up till four how old
(57:53) are you how old am I yeah oh I'm
(58:00) 53 you're older you're not old it's not like you got one foot in the grave you
(58:06) could go another 20 20 30 years yeah I don't know my my grandmother died at uh4
(58:12) so I'd like to beat that record so you're only halfway through
(58:17) life I know but I'm old enough to need a nap every once in a while I'm 25 and I'm wow 25 i' I've been
(58:26) been like that since I was 25 but I'm 33 and I'm I'm like that still I perpetually think of myself well
(58:32) I used to perpetually think of myself as a 19-year-old with a big wallet and now my my wife tells me that I'm I'm
(58:38) probably matured up to about 22 so I have to go with
(58:43) that what are people oh what are people complaining about with that debate I
(58:49) didn't watch it all I don't think anybody's complaining um we're not complaining we're in awe that it went so
(58:56) smoothly yeah it should have been like event turned out to
(59:01) be well that's what I'm saying it's like when people spur out you guys don't like it when they don't spur out you guys
(59:07) don't like in other words like now I don't let me just make my point spy can
(59:13) I just I agree with you that's that's amazing make a quick Point Melanie
(59:19) please that's the only way you're like a chick you interrupt like a chick sorry I just thought you would find interesting
(59:27) Co you know how I feel about and don't forget ladies and gentlemen you can still put anyone in timeout we're going
(59:34) back to that game yeah well you put me in timeout you're not going to hear what I have to say from personal experience
(59:42) oh I'm te I'm teasing relax I experienced look
(59:49) trust me my brother never had kids but he he he
(59:56) it's just a bad situation he married a witch she turned out to be a witch and I knew she was a witch but basically
(1:00:02) they've been married 40 years when he basically has two step kids and when he
(1:00:09) met her they were like three and five or something or two and four three and now
(1:00:16) they're like 40 over 40 now so she's he's been with this lady 40 years and I can
(1:00:22) attest do I feel like they're my kid my nephews I do but I feel like they're not
(1:00:29) my blood and I know my brother has gone out of his way to pay for a lot of he's paying for one of the grandkids to go to
(1:00:35) col he's well the grand kid got scholarships to go back East for some college it's still 70 grand a year he's paying 15 grand of it but he makes about
(1:00:42) 350 a years so it's no big deal but what I'm saying is he's I see what he goes through his
(1:00:51) wife doesn't treat me the nicest she and I have never got along because she's a narcissist and BAS basically it's kind
(1:00:57) of like let me tell you where benefits me though okay I'm going to tell you
(1:01:03) honestly we have a lot of weird family Dynamics in my family just for various reasons okay you know there's somebody
(1:01:10) in my family that doesn't get along with somebody else so the friend of my friend is there'll be somebody's enemy in my family okay here's the deal I'm going to
(1:01:17) tell you how it benefits how this stepfather nonsense benefits guys like me okay I don't have kids right so that
(1:01:25) means if I had if my brother really had kids with this
(1:01:31) woman I would feel like 100% obligated to leave my money to my real blood
(1:01:38) nephews I have two of them at least one of them and one of them I may still leave stuff to but the fact that they're
(1:01:46) not my blood nephews I'm going to be quite honest half my money is going to a cat
(1:01:53) adoption agency that a lady runs out here so what I'm saying is the good
(1:01:58) here's the only Pro it's to guys like me who are the brothers of these people because here's
(1:02:04) why I don't have to in other words I don't I'm not
(1:02:10) obligated to leave any I would let's face it if they were my blood nephews I
(1:02:15) would 100% feel obligated now I get along with one one I neutral with I'd 100% feel obligated but the fact that
(1:02:22) they're not my blood nephews plus my brother's a millionaire I don't give a [ __ ] but the fact that they're not my
(1:02:27) blood nephews I don't really feel obligated so while it hurts him because he's had to pay for a lot of [ __ ] over
(1:02:34) the years for kids that are not his benefits guys like me but it still has
(1:02:40) had an overall effect on my brother the family I'm just saying and keep in mind
(1:02:46) these kids hey she's cool with the ex-husband everybody goes together and every it's a big happy thing nobody you
(1:02:53) know everybody's pretty cool with except weird [ __ ] but what I'm saying is you're never going if all I'm gonna
(1:03:01) say is this it's like adopting some I don't know what adopting is like but what I'm saying is there's a different
(1:03:07) feeling you have from and keep in mind these nephews have been with me 40 plus years so what I'm saying is but I still
(1:03:14) don't feel like they're my [ __ ] blood and they're not so in other words when they go and have kids which they have
(1:03:20) and their grandkids are coming out now it's still not my brother's bloodline it's not m bloodline it's another
(1:03:27) family's bloodline so in a weird way you know what I mean sorry about the little
(1:03:33) but it is a weird I'm just gonna say nothing no shade on single mothers all I'm saying is a man who wants to carry
(1:03:39) his legacy on and have his own kids with his own bloodline everybody I think will
(1:03:45) agree with me that just kind of [ __ ] he [ __ ] that up if he doesn't have prior kids I mean what do you have to say
(1:03:51) everybody but Melanie I never Melanie well shout out to Melanie for the five
(1:03:57) she timed herself out but we didn't have to time you out because Spicoli spoke for the whole five minutes so it's okay
(1:04:04) exactly and then Noah are coming in with the 10 nuh time me out first I'm the
(1:04:10) literal worst s sorry only I mention let
(1:04:15) me tell you what let me give my people some love hitting the membership tab thank
(1:04:22) you so much no we're glad you're here and glad you could be enter entertained this evening uh welcome my friend okay I
(1:04:30) also saw someone else donate $2 to keep the joke going I just thank
(1:04:36) you so sorry Arbiter I I missed I apologize thank you Arbiter may I be
(1:04:42) timed out as well yes I'm just gonna time myself out and you guys carry on the show okay S I just wanted to say you
(1:04:50) can see excuse me I'm gonna I have to go anyway take a shower and go out sir you can see why I was felt to go on because
(1:04:57) how many people even though I've never married a single mother my brother I don't know how he's successfully been
(1:05:03) married to this [ __ ] for 40 years or they got married in like they somewhere
(1:05:08) like 38 years they've been married almost 40 years never separated but I don't they're both alike so it's like
(1:05:14) too weirdos you know weird but what I'm saying is I'm giving you a perspective from a guy who has seen it close up my
(1:05:22) older brother only 13 months older than me I've seen it close up and I've been it's gone along for 40 [ __ ] years and
(1:05:30) it's just it's just a weird I mean I realize we're in 2024 but it is nobody
(1:05:37) can say it doesn't feel different and you know what it's just like a stepfather would feel the same way he's not raising his kids it's just a weird
(1:05:44) feeling to me you know I mean I have you know I don't have kids but if I wanted to have kids I would want my own kids
(1:05:49) and my own legacy I'll tell you why I don't want to put the energy into raising somebody else's kids this is me
(1:05:54) personally raising kids is a very very challenging position it's not really a
(1:06:00) job it's a mentorship kind of thing so you want to do it to your own kids just
(1:06:05) like cats I'll give you an example before I leave oh my God I want to get a cat that wait I wouldn't want to get a
(1:06:12) cat that's five years old or 10 years old that's already grown and try to raise it I'd rather get it at eight
(1:06:17) weeks and then I can groom it Mentor it the way I want it to be from an eight weeks we get it we get it we get it
(1:06:26) out for the addition Michelle n you're looking n you're looking very sexy you
(1:06:34) know what NE you're very passable I never shut
(1:06:41) up I will literally pay whatever it takes to get timed out because I'm at the top of cuck Mountain arbiter's got
(1:06:49) nothing on me you guys C me up I think you got another one I want to interrupt
(1:06:57) I just dropped him and I don't care oh thank you uh most thank you tri trip
(1:07:03) trip One Tribe one for the five most good Mothers don't want to be single mothers good people shouldn't be
(1:07:08) punished just because they were done wrong in a previous situation I do agree with that that's a very well I wanted I
(1:07:16) wanted to take the the societal look at it because I think that ideally when a
(1:07:22) man uh you know conceives a child with a woman he should be there for his kids
(1:07:29) but in a situation like we have so many single you know mother households in
(1:07:34) society and again these women they get by but if there is a man that wants to
(1:07:41) step up and take on the burden of someone else's kids why should I shame that why should I be um you know why
(1:07:49) should I look down upon that I think that takes like a great degree of like courage and uh you know I think that
(1:07:55) admirable I don't think that if we're if we're signing the label cuck to these
(1:08:01) men if men aren't seriously considering prospective partners because of a child
(1:08:06) in the relationship like I think that it's just a a net negative like like I
(1:08:11) had a I had a stepdad too and my stepdad is my dad like for all intents and
(1:08:18) purposes we could not be any more different um in every single way but he
(1:08:23) is my dad and I'm grateful to have had him so that's that's my view on the
(1:08:29) topic yeah that's a good view I like it any other response I I think there's
(1:08:35) there's also like an inherent danger to shaming that which is like right Wingers
(1:08:41) came claim to care about kids you know don't murder kids blah blah blah well single mothers have a really hard time
(1:08:47) raising kids they do their best don't get me wrong but it's it's it's a two parent job regardless of who those
(1:08:53) parents are but um and if you want to see better outcomes for kids rather than just you know making sure where women
(1:09:00) carry them to term then you know this is something you should focus on and if you don't then it just gives um pro-choice
(1:09:07) people like me a really good argument that hey you know maybe we shouldn't uh be telling women to carry kids if
(1:09:13) they're just going to be single mothers I I think we kind of take this
(1:09:22) it's kind of a two-way street right so we keep saying single mothers are bad single mothers are bad bad bad bad and
(1:09:28) then if a a stepdad does step in to provide the ability for a single mom to
(1:09:36) no longer be a single mom and offer these children it's the best interest of the children right to have a two- parent
(1:09:43) household and then the shame just gets diverted over to the dad now that's
(1:09:50) That's Heavy shoulders for that to sit on uh but inevitably like you're solving the problem by no longer
(1:10:00) having a single mom now she's a married woman um and with a two parent household
(1:10:06) so in all aspects like yeah he may take a verbal lashing you know any man that
(1:10:12) goes in as a single dad or I'm sorry as a stepdad may take a verbal lashing but
(1:10:17) overall he knows at the end of the day he's doing like a good thing I think and
(1:10:23) arbiter coming in with the $2 I am broke but Noah is a
(1:10:28) [ __ ] um Sarah let me if I could let me let me I'm gonna I'm going to run
(1:10:34) through a couple of things and I hope not to Jumble it up too much but um so uh first um you know been on the right
(1:10:41) uh pretty much my whole life and I um everyone I know is for a nuclear family
(1:10:47) be it a step family or adoption or whatever those are all viable options with everyone I know on the right now I
(1:10:55) do believe that there is a growing segment uh I notice a growing segment of
(1:11:02) of the culture and I'm not sure if they're right middle left or just totally [ __ ]
(1:11:09) confused that have this idea that um you
(1:11:15) know the sing you know there's a single woman or a single mother stigma you know that um that that uh and and to be fair
(1:11:23) there is there's some truth to that to the um some of the points such as you know she's just using a man for
(1:11:30) his resources and so on and so forth and I actually the other day I was doing some research for one of my shows and I
(1:11:36) run across this and I don't remember if it was Tik Tock or Instagram or whatever
(1:11:42) but it was you know it was it was a a page that was dedicated to shorts and it was all women over 35 that
(1:11:50) were single mothers that could not find a date and it was hundreds of of women
(1:11:56) and they're all they were all like reasonably attractive more more than likely
(1:12:01) reasonably sane women and these are women that that profess they cannot get a date because of their age and because
(1:12:08) they have have children um so that's a that's a sad uh that's a that's a sad segment of our society and I I do think
(1:12:14) that we need to address that I'm just not really sure how you would
(1:12:19) um and I'm not the person to to try and figure that out to be honest with you um I've I haven't dated in 20 years so I'm
(1:12:27) I'm a little bit out of the game I'm I'm a little rusty um you know but uh looking at it I can actually I I mean I
(1:12:35) I understand where I understand understand where men would have some hesitation but on the other U on the
(1:12:42) other side of it uh I think it as men it is our job to be um be
(1:12:49) fathers so um for whatever that entails for individuals but would you so you
(1:12:56) like when you comment on their appearance mhm I guess that's like one thing but they seem to reason them as
(1:13:04) yeah like do you see them as viable seemed reasonable right like like the one the one woman that that kind of stuck in my head was she was reasonably
(1:13:10) attractive she actually um had made some reasonable financial decisions and and
(1:13:16) um had had downsized into an RV to keep her bills low and and that's kind of
(1:13:21) where the story ended so I can't I don't have like I don't have her biography or anything but it was just like a a you
(1:13:27) know however long a short is a minute and a half or whatever 90 80 what whatever seconds was just like hey I'm
(1:13:34) you know 49 and whatever and whatever and I can't get a date because no man will date me and I thought that was very
(1:13:39) strange yeah I kind of I mean on the one hand I can see it but you know I mean I
(1:13:45) I know just as many guys are like man you know I'm you I'm too old to be running around with 20 year olds but I
(1:13:51) can't find anyone today matter fact I know a guy literally right now that that told me that the other day and I'm like
(1:13:56) why don't you just I mean there's a ton of women out there dude just go find one so I seriously like when they say oh
(1:14:03) like I can't find it's like how many men did you ask out today probably none right well Michelle probone you're a
(1:14:10) special case like I If I'm married and I can still get like a a long-term boyfriend I
(1:14:16) think these single women can like find a freaking date I think you need to like show up and be nice to a man and they
(1:14:24) like they like that like yeah I mean it's it's not just oh oh my apologies
(1:14:30) and speaking of being nice Arbiter dropping by again with the two the patriarchy is here to save
(1:14:37) you yes my white Knights all over go ahead
(1:14:45) Mel I think it's fair uh like you don't have to be very picky for a lot of men
(1:14:50) to just kind of be like I'm just going to say like they try too hard but like I I mean like a lot of things that just
(1:14:57) really like ruin first dates and stuff like that and I I don't know I I kind of
(1:15:04) feel for women with at least all the men I've met on here like if that's what the dating pool is like like gez I know it's
(1:15:10) probably not that bad but also like you know it it can't be
(1:15:16) pretty well this is not real life yeah well I'm gonna say how could you
(1:15:21) consider any guy on that's even signal as somebody that's part of like any sort
(1:15:27) of dating pool like realistically right um I well that's like you're you're
(1:15:33) saying like from what you've seen online that that's like that that you're apprehensive or reluctant about I'm just
(1:15:39) saying if it's representative of what women have to choose from then they don't have a lot of options but I'm also
(1:15:45) admitting like that's just online I don't know much about like what it's like in real life andon me for just a
(1:15:51) moment I need to voice confirm Noah yes can you hear me okay I can I just want
(1:15:57) to make sure we're not going to get any peen flashing or anything weird on screen absolutely not I have no
(1:16:04) camera that's fair all right thank you back to back to D
(1:16:09) [Laughter] M that I just I just chimed in to say
(1:16:15) that I think it's stupid to say that now I think what you're saying is done well
(1:16:21) I think you know men online if if they are you know trying trying to represent men in any way which they seem to when
(1:16:28) I'm not calling them out at least then you know good start would be like the way you act around women the way you
(1:16:35) like how you are in their comments and stuff it's the the creep factor is just
(1:16:40) off the charts in my opinion Sarah your chat's pretty nice though they're I mean
(1:16:45) we've kind of trained them to a degree in terms of like what we allow and what we don't allow um you know and I had to
(1:16:52) put a pretty hard foot down on on you know hate speech and things like that but
(1:16:57) overall yeah yeah exactly and because we do that you know more people
(1:17:04) are more open to coming on panel um they can roast they can have their fun that
(1:17:11) doesn't bother me any bit but but when we tap into like to hate speech or or
(1:17:16) personal things doxing stuff like that is that's an absolute noo and and arbiter comes by again to
(1:17:24) speak to you Noah he says win win Noah don't say anything about me I can't
(1:17:31) actually I can't actually talk in the chat right now because I just subscribed to you so I gotta wait 20 minutes oh
(1:17:36) yeah that is a thing that is a thing we we like to make sure that's on lockdown uh especially when we have uh you know
(1:17:43) new crowds coming in to watch and things like that so yeah it's got to be like you have to be able to you have to be
(1:17:49) willing to commit to 20 minutes uh to be able to chat I think the chat is a
(1:17:55) privilege not a right you know Sarah I haven't uh I I don't get your fan club
(1:18:00) through as much anymore but when they do oh the weird one the we roast the living
(1:18:08) [ __ ] out of them they they can say whatever they want and my chat just goes in on them so
(1:18:17) hard they just give up I think they just give up and and move along because they they can't make fun of when the worst
(1:18:23) thing they can say is that I'm fat and bald and I'm like yeah and you don't
(1:18:29) even cam up so we can't see how ugly you are so I mean this is kind of why I did the
(1:18:36) Furby because it's e it's funnier when people attack this rather than my actual appearances yeah even I can get laughs
(1:18:43) out of that sometimes yeah yeah but um but yeah the the the haters are
(1:18:48) interesting um you know my my chat's actually really I really like most of the people here's this fairly tame they
(1:18:55) still make fun of us but they're but they don't cross they don't cross lines
(1:19:00) you know and that's I respect that Noah thoughts on the topic uh I thought it was a great debate
(1:19:07) honestly I thought it was going to be a lot more of a slugfest that it actually was uh I listened to both Undead chronic
(1:19:14) and Andrew um no it was it was really really good for the most part I mean
(1:19:19) very short-lived debate I think we can all agree there kind of really wasn't even a debate at the end of the day
(1:19:27) mhm yeah for the record I renamed it the fastest debate
(1:19:32) ever definitely no it it was kind of refreshing to see you know them not
(1:19:38) going at each other's throats so kind of like when two guys get in a fight in a
(1:19:43) parking lot and it's like they throw two punches they realize they're both tough guys and they just like exactly and walk
(1:19:50) away and all right we're done yeah yeah somebody's asking me what am I where am
(1:19:56) I looking um oh you have your monitors up don't you oh yeah I'm looking right
(1:20:02) at my monitor yeah um I uh chaos I've actually been married for 20 years and looks like I'll be
(1:20:09) married for another 20 or so so I'm good with that my wife I'm just gonna I'm
(1:20:16) just gonna step away to use the the ladi's room for just a moment Michelle's in charge that I feel comfortable with
(1:20:22) this panel don't be crazy one thing uh one thing I wanted to focus in on and
(1:20:27) that I thought was important that Andrew pointed out is that the actual Act of being cocked like the the person who's
(1:20:33) being Coast to enjoy what is going on right like he he aligned it with kind of
(1:20:38) the the fetishistic slash like yeah horn idea of the word
(1:20:44) but um do you think it's or they just have to get something out of it either
(1:20:49) the either the humiliation or the enjoyment or the what whatever emotion
(1:20:56) that they're looking for I well I bring it up to decouple it from the idea of enjoyment and permissibility right so
(1:21:03) are you allowing something to happen that you don't necessarily enjoy versus you're allowing something to happen
(1:21:09) because you enjoy that happening right so I think that that one specific piece
(1:21:15) um to the idea of like the whole c as it's used derogatory is important as
(1:21:21) well where it's like if your resources are being utilized by someone else knowingly then you're permiss like you
(1:21:28) might not like it but you're you know you're consenting to it but does that's like I think that's
(1:21:34) the way the word cuck is used more it's not used by somebody actually deriving
(1:21:39) enjoyment from like being taken advantage of or whatever being taken from a ride I think it's more of that
(1:21:45) like obviously they they know some element of the situation or
(1:21:51) the dynamic isn't optimal and you know it's like feeding on their resources or whatever they're
(1:21:57) allowing it to happen so I feel like that's where the word is actually aimed and directed more so yeah the definition
(1:22:04) of the word is very Dynamic I've know I've even seen it used for like this guy is you know being fooled by his
(1:22:11) girlfriend or he doesn't have control over her behavior so he's a cuck and it's I sometimes it can the definition
(1:22:18) can definitely Source itself from you know what I consider at least to be a toxic definition of masculine where it's
(1:22:25) like you know one you know say your girlfriend cheats on you well now you're no longer a man or something it's I I
(1:22:32) don't know I I see a lot of people who are just like anxious about that well what are they saying is the is another
(1:22:38) question I have so it's like we understand the cuck definition to be you know deriving some enjoyment but if
(1:22:44) somebody is making that criticism of you and they're shielding it behind you are a cuck when in reality that's not
(1:22:51) actually what's going on what are they actually criticizing you for what is that you know synonym for the
(1:22:57) word what word are they using that that they could be using but they're not you know even when you put it that way yeah
(1:23:04) it's like they're saying you're not enough of a man sorry whoever's trying to speak go ahead no that that's okay so so the interesting thing is that how the
(1:23:11) whole word was even the whole origin of it uh was even
(1:23:18) created is about a species of bird where the female would would choose a good Nest provider and resource gatherer and
(1:23:26) then couple with not couple sexually with that bird she would she would
(1:23:31) maintain the home with that bird and then go out and get genetics from another bird and so this this good
(1:23:38) resource provider this good Nest Builder was UN unwittingly and unknowingly raising offspring that wasn't his yeah
(1:23:46) thus thus his his genetic code would be would be ended it's the there's an
(1:23:52) aspect of unbeknownst um that I think people are missing out on um the Urban Dictionary kind of Slam
(1:24:01) slight disrespect you know backhanded uh statement would be you're a cuck because
(1:24:06) you're being you know you're watching your girl being bang you know smashed out by other dudes um both are correct
(1:24:15) but I think I think if you look at where it originated from I think it's it's pretty important by the way for anyone
(1:24:21) curious what would yeah what you were talking about is called brood parasitism by the way and it's it's very complex
(1:24:28) and it's very interesting yeah so so I think the aspect of the the not knowing not being
(1:24:34) aware that you're your your genetic code is going to die off because you've been
(1:24:40) tricked that I think that's the ultimate slap in the face of a decent Bird that's you know resource providing and
(1:24:46) Gathering uh you know building a good nest for for the structure of that family and then raising somebody else's
(1:24:51) kids the maybe that could be for people though right like say you're like you're one of those red pill people or you
(1:24:58) tried to be and it just didn't work out for you so now you're a black pillar and like I'm never going to be worth anything but then like the [ __ ] comes
(1:25:04) along it's like well you raise my kids from this guy from this hunk who had amazing genetics but then he walked out on me it's like yeah maybe actually like
(1:25:11) I can have really successful children and now I feel weird because now I'm talking about reproducing but anyways
(1:25:17) the point being like if we're if we are talking about this on a genetics level it is sometimes like a like a boost up
(1:25:24) to be able to raise someone else's kids especially like if you can't have your own or if you don't want to pass on your
(1:25:29) genetics I think if the the biological father is capable and another you know
(1:25:35) capable or less capable man is raising your kids I would argue that you're the one being cocked at least if you're
(1:25:42) applying it in this situation in this context right if for whatever reason you can't get your [ __ ] together you can't
(1:25:47) get your priorities together you have something in your life that is not allowing you to be present for your
(1:25:52) children and someone else has stepped in I think that in itself should be where
(1:25:58) the criticism itself is focused not the other way around I don't think it's about like I didn't say anything about
(1:26:03) whether or not they would be worse at raising the kids um so if that's the case then yeah that would be a downgrade
(1:26:09) but I think the person who's worse off is like the person who's flighty and like seems seems to not be able to
(1:26:15) handle responsibility which would be the the biological dad who left well it speaks to how well adjusted you are for
(1:26:22) the things like whether it's accountability or taking responsibility for things that you create or
(1:26:27) circumstances that you own in life right you receive a child you're responsible for that child and now you've had to you
(1:26:34) know like pass on that responsibility unowned or unwillingly to
(1:26:39) someone else who was in a better position who was more capable right so I
(1:26:44) think in that situation in my opinion I feel like if we're looking at it from um what's the word like Co colloquial usage
(1:26:52) of the word cck I feel like that applies more than that that situation um like if you apply it to the whole contention of
(1:26:58) the debate I would say that like Andrew is cucking the original father but I
(1:27:03) guess that's my perception of this I don't think you could be cucked if you give up the if you give up the rights I
(1:27:10) I I don't think that follows I I understand where you're going with that and I and I would agree that if you want
(1:27:15) to be in your child's life and you're and you're and the woman decides to
(1:27:22) replace you with someone else and deny you your ability um to um be with your
(1:27:30) children um than then to some degree that would be your um and you didn't
(1:27:36) fight for it um then that that would be definit 100% that's a that's a a cuckold
(1:27:42) relationship for sure that's a distinction I didn't even consider but you would but you wouldn't open that up to then somebody not taking ownership or
(1:27:50) like accountability or not being ready to be a parent well I I don't know that I could ever
(1:27:56) determine that 100% I can under I can determine whether or not you want to be there because you can tell me that um I
(1:28:02) can determine by your actions your what I can what I perceive your motivations
(1:28:08) are but I couldn't determine whether you gave up or you know what your inter what your
(1:28:14) internal thoughts were on it unless even if you even if you told me that doesn't
(1:28:20) necessarily mean that you're being intellectually honest with me so I think that that I wouldn't be able to tell that
(1:28:26) like I don't think that that most people publicly would be able be able to
(1:28:31) tell but now if if if for example you know I have a friend that
(1:28:37) I'm I'm observing him and his wife um are having trouble she leaves him for
(1:28:43) another man takes the Kids Cuts him out of the kids's life and he allows that to
(1:28:49) happen he doesn't fight he doesn't take them to court he does what best for the
(1:28:55) children um and and just kind of lets it go then I would I would say at that
(1:29:00) point that she is cucking that guy even if even if he's not getting anything out
(1:29:05) of it she is getting something out of it emotionally and obviously probably
(1:29:13) financially as well so or resource wise I would say uh but it would be I mean it
(1:29:18) it's so it's so Case by case right it's so situation depending there's a lot of
(1:29:24) nuance to it it's just really hard to say if this then that without having all
(1:29:33) of the parameters aligned you've got to have all the holes in the Swiss cheese aligned for it to
(1:29:38) work I think maybe not yeah I I think I think I'm questioning the utility in um
(1:29:46) so like people making broad criticisms about people's uh family Dynamics right
(1:29:52) like Undead did towards Andrew um obviously he's speaking to
(1:29:58) some sort of like culture where he is able to say okay Andrew is cuck because
(1:30:05) is cucked or is a cuck for this reason like he's playing into that culture because he thinks he can get some sort
(1:30:10) of like uh you know uh consensus around that but I'm arguing that if there is
(1:30:17) any utility in that being done then the person we should focus on again wouldn't
(1:30:22) be the person stepping up it should be the other person right like if there is any
(1:30:29) positive element that comes out of actually using the word that way then I feel like it should be attributed to you
(1:30:35) know that biological father regardless of circumstance because you know like I
(1:30:41) I feel like that's just more worthy of a criticism yeah would you consider it like a utility like say there's a
(1:30:48) preacher and they're saying all women just want to be kept in the kitchen they might say that they want wom's rights
(1:30:54) and this stuff but they want you to dominate them and put them in the kitchen yet this person's been through three divorce and that's just public
(1:30:59) knowledge at this point do you think there's any utility to maybe calling out that that hypocrisy well the utility
(1:31:05) like I'll demonstrate it this way so when we use the word simp like we're talking about men who kind of like um go
(1:31:14) around their so primarily for women that where it's not mutual right so it's a
(1:31:20) one-way interaction with a woman where they expend their resources their time their
(1:31:27) whatever their emotional capacity for someone who isn't reciprocating whatsoever but when we use the word simp
(1:31:33) and when we shame men for being simps there's utility in that because what
(1:31:39) you're actually identifying at the heart of it is like have some self-respect have some boundaries you know like do
(1:31:46) something for yourself don't take your you know don't take your whole being and
(1:31:51) um you know attribute your personal or things that matter to you to your
(1:31:56) relationship with somebody who doesn't reciprocate right so that's why I'm saying there's utility in using the word simp even though we misuse the word if
(1:32:03) there's a utility in calling people [ __ ] then that that's any I I've circled on
(1:32:10) my own argument now I don't yeah know I'd agree actually it probably actually sets up um kind of
(1:32:17) like standards for men that are and again I'm G to say this word toxic if you guys want me to elaborate I will
(1:32:23) just but I don't want to get too deep into it but just the general idea that you know well you know if a woman takes
(1:32:30) advantage of you you're not a man now you're a s or you're not a man now you're a cuck is kind of again
(1:32:36) colloquially how I see it used the most and I also see like this used in a lot of spaces where men are just generally
(1:32:42) like angry and act out that anger a lot so I have to wonder personally like are
(1:32:48) we pushing men into a corner where like by calling them this and putting them into this box
(1:32:54) that you know they're they're like afraid of women now and they see them as like oh this woman's going to take advantage of me which is kind of like
(1:33:01) the Red Hill I mean I I I could see that I I talk to people that are like why why
(1:33:07) bother I actually just was talking to a young man that's in a why bother situation and um but I think that there
(1:33:15) I my observation is and look I don't see everything in the world so this is just my observation and I'm sure it it varies
(1:33:22) right between you personal experience is going to be different what I see is I
(1:33:28) see the application of a few terms grow
(1:33:34) societally to fit many things that they really shouldn't and so when you have
(1:33:43) um when you when you paint with a BRI a broad brush right you don't always hit
(1:33:49) the hit what you want to hit right I mean you're just sort of you you
(1:33:54) know it's just too generic and that's I think we're running into I think this is what we're running
(1:34:01) into with the idea of people call well you know you're a cuck because your wife
(1:34:06) took your kids and married somebody else well no he's not a cuck at that point he's a he's a man who's lost his family
(1:34:14) but he didn't will you know more than likely and you know you don't know you
(1:34:19) probably don't know whether how much he's fought for that how much he how much he tried to PR vent it what the
(1:34:24) situation is you know so so but we you but we would you you know there are many people that would use that term well
(1:34:31) your wife is cucked you right and the same thing with simp right like there's always these guys who will come in and
(1:34:37) say oh well you said something nice to this woman so you're a simp well well no I'm being polite it's it's just called
(1:34:43) being polite and and I think that it's a very interesting Dynamic that we have
(1:34:49) going on here where um a lot of times I don't even think the
(1:34:54) people using the words actually know what the words mean and this is what Andrew started out with is let's define
(1:35:02) this because I don't think what you're saying this means actually means what it means and and he was right that you know
(1:35:09) it wasn't it wasn't at all you know for example to me my understanding of a simp
(1:35:16) is someone that is constantly showering someone with affection that's not
(1:35:23) returning and there's no intention of returning that affection and it's a it's a dead hole but they keep trying to fill
(1:35:30) it that to me as a s right you're never going to get anywhere you're wasting your time and you're you're you're lying
(1:35:37) to yourself about the possibility of there ever being anything
(1:35:43) there yeah and I just want to point out like the word simp does have an interesting history where the definition
(1:35:48) has changed a lot it started out with simpleton then became romantic fool then in hip-hop kind of showed up as men who
(1:35:55) let women manipulate them and then to the and blood to the internet and these words are always changing kind of
(1:36:01) especially with colloquial usage I think if we're talking about utility the utility kind of points to men who get
(1:36:08) women pregnant and just walk out on them because they're not ready for responsibility in my opinion if we're going to use it colloquially instead of
(1:36:15) literally that's probably the best direction to go and because I think that's a group that honestly does need a
(1:36:22) little bit more shame I feel like it all comes down to um having you you have to
(1:36:27) have all of the pieces of the puzzle to understand what is being said and a lot of times you don't right so I don't know
(1:36:34) that [Music] um I mean this is more of a treaties on
(1:36:39) modern language and the and how uh how much fallacy there is in it right like we we use all of these um slang words um
(1:36:50) that again as you said the meaning are constantly changing and so I might say something
(1:37:01) and I don't know what that was got some Ambiance from
(1:37:07) someone thanks um uh but I mean I just think that and and and you know what
(1:37:13) happens is is that if I have one understanding of a word and you have another different understanding of that
(1:37:18) same word or group of words we end up talking past each other and and what
(1:37:25) we're saying we may be even saying the same thing but because we're using the wrong um uh various um we're coming from
(1:37:32) different points of view it doesn't mean the same thing to us and so we we end up arguing when we shouldn't necessarily be
(1:37:39) arguing it doesn't seem like uh I think even from today on it doesn't seem like
(1:37:45) an insult that I could necessarily take into very strong consideration at least
(1:37:51) the way it's being used in this space um because even in a situation where it
(1:37:57) was accurate like someone's like oh look at this cuck and it's like sneako in a chair whatever deriving enjoyment from
(1:38:04) that Dynamic at that point I'm just like why you know what I'm saying like I at that
(1:38:09) point I'm acknowledging that somebody does derive enjoyment and so now what like there just doesn't really see it
(1:38:16) seems like a dead end at the end of the day it's weird Destiny right Destiny's Destiny will literally say you know yeah
(1:38:22) you know Friday night we would cuck stuff and and and he but it it is a he's literally using it in its exact correct
(1:38:31) manner um but people take that and run with it in in a bunch of different directions which is partially because he
(1:38:37) is who he is and we we can all say that but but yeah I don't I don't know the destiny reference
(1:38:43) but other any other word on the internet right if people don't like you or they don't agree with you then you're the uh
(1:38:49) the bad guys from WW2 right if you say anything that some people just disagree with then you've become those people or
(1:38:55) if they don't like something you're doing you've become the SM s or you're the cuck or whatever they just weaponize
(1:39:02) words that have these hot button little topics to them to try to strengthen their position and to weaken your
(1:39:08) position make you look bad make them look good and like grid was just laying out hey here's what I think this
(1:39:13) actually means and people don't take the time to lay it out to spell out what they actually think it means they just
(1:39:19) call you a cuck and because you're you're bad you suck you're a cuck they like
(1:39:24) that's I I've encountered this with uh there was a time and Ne can attest to
(1:39:29) this and I may not have handle it the best like you know some uh introspection
(1:39:34) uh and looking back can always help but uh a lot of people were uh comment
(1:39:40) commentating reacting to stuff on the internet and they would just they would call everything that they didn't like or
(1:39:45) that wasn't like proper like the arler or they would say like this person's sping out and I was like I'm starting to
(1:39:51) have no idea what the heck you mean because people would call me the arser and I'd be like okay so I'm the arser
(1:39:58) now do I just stop being myself well and that's the like you you brought up the one I was thinking of too sping out like
(1:40:04) what does that actually mean like what does that come that comes from like Asbergers right so like somebody with a legit mental health condition and just
(1:40:11) because somebody flies off the handle then they say oh you're you're spurting out so we've taken these terms and we've
(1:40:17) watered them down and just made them oh anybody does something bad they're this thing which it's like no maybe they were
(1:40:23) just mad or maybe it was just a personally rational person that felt passionate about something for a moment but now we label them this thing to try
(1:40:30) to diminish their position again well they they hyperlink they're almost like hyperlinks to um like a like a like a
(1:40:39) particular kind of behavior that is kind of frowned upon culturally so like you
(1:40:44) say someone is sperging in the debate or whatever I mean there's certain communities that use it utilize it in
(1:40:50) different ways but what you're saying to the person is that you're making an emotional argument you're not focused on
(1:40:57) the topic at hand you're you're really motivated by some sort of like secondary objective where you're not even
(1:41:04) listening to what's being said you're just kind of going and and I I I
(1:41:09) understand the utility in those sorts of things right like but but all these words like [ __ ] simp you're sperging
(1:41:17) like all these weird characterizations of behavior like they're all quite nebulous like if we're being honest so
(1:41:26) um I guess that's why they're used so often if I'm calling you a [ __ ] then it's like well no you recognize I'm not
(1:41:34) even using the word properly so are you going to strongly are you going to take that into consideration and I think
(1:41:40) that's what people some people know to be like dude this guy doesn't even know what the word means like I'm not goingon
(1:41:45) to listen to his insult but other people they're maybe ignorant to that fact and then they start you know going back and
(1:41:51) you get into this whole tossing poop at each other thing and it turns into just a messy internet that's just
(1:41:57) kind of how it happens sometimes Don coming in with the $2
(1:42:02) everyone please support the brat tomato fun thank you OPC Don we appreciate you back to you NE well why it makes it
(1:42:09) particularly interesting is I think we all recognize this in our subconscious to where when somebody like Undead says
(1:42:17) I'm debating Andrew Wilson on because I think he's a cck then we're all listening because we're like okay like
(1:42:24) one per okay like what does he believe a cuck is I think cuck means this how is he going to justify this argument how is
(1:42:30) he going to construct this argument and as we could you know and and I think his argument really just demonstrated what
(1:42:37) we're talking about right now is like how you know like nebulous it is like
(1:42:42) you're not I don't know yeah it's all situational right it's just like if if
(1:42:48) um if I'm having a a talk with a group of people that I say I I shoot matches
(1:42:53) with or something we have an entirely different meaning of language of of common terms that that if I if I talk to
(1:43:00) someone else about it they'll have they'll literally not understand what I'm talking about
(1:43:05) they'll have a completely different meaning in the words that I'm using and it's all very situational and like so if
(1:43:11) if you if you say cuck to me I go to the dictionary version and you know it's a dude that allows his his woman to have
(1:43:17) sex with other other women knowingly um you know if if you tell me me well this
(1:43:23) dude's a cuck because his wife cheated on him I'd be like no he's he's not a cuck he got cheated on he's a Vic you
(1:43:28) know he's kind of a victim in that story that you told me right so um so context
(1:43:34) has a lot who you're talking to has a lot to do with it and it's just like the the sperging thing right like I the way
(1:43:41) I understand it it is is exactly what Primal said was I it's related to to
(1:43:46) autism right and Asbergers and having to finish a sentence right where where when you're trying to have a debate and the
(1:43:52) and the just will not stop trying to make their point even though you maybe have conceded it or you just want them
(1:43:58) to you need clarification but they just will not stop talking about it and they
(1:44:04) just won't give up and so you're like why are you you know stop sping and we'll just calm down we'll get to it um
(1:44:10) but then if you go somewhere else it is exactly as Nev said it's just somebody um that is just freaking out and and
(1:44:17) just ra rambling on about nothingness you know so uh context I think has a
(1:44:22) whole lot to do with language in general right well if your utility is to try
(1:44:28) to Sarah did you wanna oh I was oh I was saying I gotta bounce I got the ovens going off and
(1:44:34) stuff I'm getting dinner pre so appreciate it I only had a few minutes I just want to come up have a good dinner
(1:44:39) yeah do all the things yeah appreciate you guys later bye I think with if the utility of it is
(1:44:45) to get someone to calm down I don't know if it's the best choice of words especially outside of communities because I understand what you're saying
(1:44:51) like within communities maybe it's more understood um that I I would say that the arser is
(1:44:57) a stronger case here though because in that case like it's it's more applied to people who don't who people just don't
(1:45:04) agree with like oh that position is the arser or you're the arser and one of the things is is like for
(1:45:12) me i' I've had the other end of it too I grew up in group homes where not just my
(1:45:17) mental health disabilities were on display but other people's were and you'd get called out a lot let me tell you um and just because it's coming from
(1:45:24) someone else who may have it doesn't make it better by the way um and one of the things like that's kind of why I
(1:45:30) brought up before like it never felt like real criticism because again if I took it to any extent it was always what
(1:45:36) am I supposed to do with myself to stop being the arler um I do my best to you know be on
(1:45:42) the same level as everyone so it's it's it's just insulting it's not helpful to me at all um and I and I almost never
(1:45:50) know what people actually mean other than like you know they uring that they that they don't like it and I think the
(1:45:55) solution here is you know we don't want to get trapped in our bubbles especially when we're having panel discussions
(1:46:01) stuff like that we want to talk to new people and stuff like that all the time bring in new communities and so it's important to maybe like break up
(1:46:08) thesaurus and learn multiple ways to make the same criticism I think that that at least makes us seem more
(1:46:14) interesting uh not so onedimensional well there's it makes sense for a space
(1:46:20) like this to have jargon and I would just want it to be really clear that when somebody tells you to stop sping
(1:46:25) it's not because they necessarily want you to stop talking there's an antagonistic element to it as well that
(1:46:30) kind of perpetrates the sperging itself like when you're telling when somebody's like like hyper fixated on you know
(1:46:38) maybe an insignificant detail or you've reduced their position to them yelling
(1:46:43) when you ask someone to stop sperging like it's not necessarily to redirect
(1:46:49) the conversation I think there's an antagonistic piece to it but I think is super important sure there can be
(1:46:55) absolutely so what if I told you and this is you know I'm speaking both from firsthand experience but also knowing
(1:47:01) kind of what neurod Divergent people are like that the people who that calls out the most are also going to be the ones
(1:47:07) who are going to be the most antagonized by it does that not seem like maybe I don't want to say predatory but like you
(1:47:13) think that's fair well I just I don't necessarily believe that when that's used it's ever
(1:47:20) used in a way that's supposed to intended to be derogatory towards people with osers like I think it's a
(1:47:26) characterization of behavior I'm going to agree with that it's not it has nothing to do sure I wasn't contesting
(1:47:32) that though okay okay just my my my point being though that it probably does
(1:47:37) disproportionately affect people and hypothetically if that's true doesn't that make a good case not to use it
(1:47:43) regardless of what people's intents are no well not necessarily because you do something really cold and glib I might
(1:47:49) say that that's very Psychopathic of you or that very like you know like it lacks
(1:47:55) well let's actually that that doesn't necessarily say that I'm making you know I'm not I'm not saying everybody watch
(1:48:02) out Ninetales is a you know a murderer or this X Y and Z well it might appear
(1:48:07) that way to people who just came on right like who just joined the internet like if I'm new here and I don't know
(1:48:12) people are using jargon I'm gonna be like wait this person's a psychopath but like but like if we actually look at the
(1:48:18) atmology of that word Psychopathic like someone can have Psychopathic traits and not be a psychopath
(1:48:23) psych saying someone is a psychopath would be actually labeling Them In fairness though Melanie some people can
(1:48:29) have [ __ ] traits and not be [ __ ] um like meaning really yeah you you can
(1:48:36) say some pretty [ __ ] stuff and not have an excuse other than you're acting like a [ __ ] you think that there's a reason and I know this is kind of begs
(1:48:43) the question a little it doesn't beg the question it's actually I feel like that we get into
(1:48:49) the the idea of we we the the further we get into limiting words and conversation and
(1:48:55) speech it's we get into the idea of tone policing and then we get into what's fair to say what's not fair to say what
(1:49:03) might hurt someone's feelings what might not you know
(1:49:08) I'm next thing you know maybe maybe maybe maybe some people need that I don't happen to know any of those people
(1:49:15) personally uh you know it's it's okay well I still think we should be mindful
(1:49:21) of what we're saying saying how we're saying and the audience that we're referring to um you know because it's
(1:49:28) not only just necessarily um tone policing yourself but it's it's just a
(1:49:34) common courtesy you know you can make the argu and I said it at the very beginning of this debate you can make
(1:49:40) you can make the argument without personal tax right and even at that like you can make the argument you can shut
(1:49:46) somebody down without you know affecting hundreds of other people or hurting
(1:49:52) other people as well well let's let's let's be intellectually honest and we're talking about in a debate I'm G to use
(1:49:59) I'll use whatever words I feel like is going to accomplish the the the task
(1:50:04) right like that's not we're not talking about two people walking down the sidewalk casually shopping we're talking about
(1:50:11) people that are engaged in an activity that's meant to be antagonistic yeah no I agree I agree
(1:50:18) what I'm saying is what I'm saying is is we still have to be mindful when we use
(1:50:23) certain words that there will be other people out there listening that will be offended by that or you know take it
(1:50:29) into consideration or whatever the case may be I'm not saying we have to necessarily give a crap about people's
(1:50:36) feelings but what I'm saying is there should be a level of courtesy to con like to consider when we're talking
(1:50:43) especially on a public forum um like can I say something without doing harm to
(1:50:50) other innocent bystanders necessarily and I think that challenges your intellect to think smarter yeah all but
(1:50:58) at the same time when we bubble wrap the whole world we just make weaker and weaker
(1:51:04) Offspring bubble wrap I'm saying I'm saying you can you can make arguments
(1:51:09) you can you know call call people names and all of those things in a smart way
(1:51:15) you know and be even more on top of that level than anything like I I think you
(1:51:22) can do better I think it's a noble thing to do to really focus your argument on the person
(1:51:27) that you're making the argument to so on that basis if it means your point is stronger because you decided that you're
(1:51:33) going to actually like take the time to characterize somebody's Behavior instead of calling them [ __ ] then I agree
(1:51:40) but not as not as a motivation to like like what GS is saying like bubble wrap the world or like that's not what I'm
(1:51:48) saying what I'm saying to this just because I feel like my well
(1:51:54) sure I think you're responding to an incomplete thought but go ahead sure and I'm not I'm not trying to Bubble Wrap
(1:51:59) anything and sorry if that is complete at the moment but I just want to point out like first of all I'm trying to draw
(1:52:05) parallels to our discussion about how we should use the word cuck properly and I I'm being consistent I said look this
(1:52:11) disproportionately affects men if we're going to use it it has to have honest criticism behind it and this is all I'm
(1:52:17) saying for using the arser if you can come up with a case where you're actually using the arser and there's honest criticism behind it instead of it
(1:52:23) being just vague the whole time which I still think it is then you know then fine but until then and I'm willing to
(1:52:30) put sperging on the side of that even though I still think we should like Sarah said be considerate but um for the
(1:52:37) purposes of utility I I don't see any reason to keep using the arer okay um
(1:52:42) could I I'm sorry I'm gonna just apologize I just have a thought that it's fleeting so let's let me catch it
(1:52:48) really quick um this is a lot like when I when I
(1:52:53) watch when I first started watching Andrew uh debate because I had uh I have I had a very interesting Viewpoint of
(1:52:59) debate be and then I see Andrew and he's like you know he's cursing he's using um
(1:53:06) some you know he would go from using very inflammatory language to using very um colloquial like you know hey let's uh
(1:53:13) let's talk you know let's just move along uh uh language and it's all for effect because it's a you know it's a
(1:53:20) debate it's it's something that is um are we okay yeah I was just waiting
(1:53:26) for you to finish your thought and then I have to voice confirm someone in I see okay I'm sorry um the uh you know so
(1:53:36) um in those cases and I think we're looking at a specific case I don't have
(1:53:41) a problem with the uh language that Andrew uses right I um I think it's
(1:53:48) okay I do I mean I I can agree with a lot of the
(1:53:54) points being made but I think that sometimes if you are doing those
(1:54:01) activities you will use inflammatory language you will use um you know all the tools at your
(1:54:11) disposal and this is and that is one of them and you need to be effective at using it I uh of course I went to a
(1:54:17) military school and so inflammatory language was just part of just another tool in a toolbox
(1:54:23) um you know it was uh it was meant um not to make
(1:54:28) you angry it was um it wasn't meant to
(1:54:35) um beat you down it was meant to drive you forward and it did so and I think
(1:54:41) that that's uh that's something that maybe is a it's again this is all highly situational I understand right like like
(1:54:47) I would not walk into somebody's place of business and go hey [ __ ] what's up
(1:54:52) unless I really knew that person right now I've had people walk into my shop
(1:54:58) when I was when I was working you know and and the door was unlocked and go hey
(1:55:04) [ __ ] what's up and that was perfectly fine but it's highly
(1:55:09) situational um so I I think that that's what we're kind of talking about and I do understand what you're saying Melanie
(1:55:15) um that if especially if you know that there's somebody that could be um
(1:55:22) you know set off by uh by the language maybe you should di you could dial it back or maybe make sure that that person
(1:55:28) wasn't quite there um but but if that person puts them in the situ themselves
(1:55:33) in the situation I'll you know it's weapons free and we're we're hot and and that's the way it's going to work and I
(1:55:40) make no apologies for that I I don't mean to uh I don't mean to to belabor the point but um you
(1:55:48) know you're kind of contradicting yourself right because you're saying first of all if if that person if they
(1:55:54) know the person's there they should be considerate but also if that person goes there then they're they deserve to have it done to
(1:56:00) them well what I'm saying is is if I know that there's somebody in my
(1:56:06) crowd situationally that is maybe they would be they would have a bad reaction to the
(1:56:12) to the language that I use and I have a I actually have a decent example I just don't want to
(1:56:17) ramble but um if I have someone that's in a situation or if I'm in a situation
(1:56:23) where I know that the language I use could inflame somebody I may I would dial it back but
(1:56:28) if they come into a situation where I am already using that language if I'm sitting at a at a for example if I'm
(1:56:35) sitting in here in the studio and I'm debating somebody and they walk in that door and they hear me saying Stop sping
(1:56:42) or quit being an [ __ ] or [ __ ] off idiot any they they walked into my Arena
(1:56:49) and I'm not going to tone that down so even clear does that does that help so
(1:56:56) just just to be clear though like even if some like when you talk about youren you talk about like maybe you have panels right or sure sure yeah if you
(1:57:05) came up on my panel um and you and you just didn't say if you if if we were if
(1:57:11) you came up on a panel and somebody was saying something and you waited till the end and you say hey
(1:57:17) guys this kind of language bugs me and you know I want to be a part of this but if you could just tone it down a little
(1:57:24) bit that panel would have a chance to say okay yeah we are or hey you know sorry this is just this is the language
(1:57:31) we use and if you know if you want to be here it is what it is if you're already on the panel and you've already set that
(1:57:38) standard for example like tonight we're being very I I believe that we're being very calm very back and you know the
(1:57:45) back and forth is really good so if we ramp this up I I actually if we ramp this up I'd probably leave because it's
(1:57:51) boring and I have better things to do um okay I think I do think I see what
(1:57:56) you're saying by the way just don't labor to try to to try to put a finer
(1:58:01) point on it in the immortal words of the uh philosopher poet uh Candace Owens
(1:58:06) when asked a question about some nonsense she said life's tough get a helmet I'm too pregnant for this
(1:58:12) [ __ ] next question um we just spent 20 minutes talking about Tom p and uh I
(1:58:18) understand two two Sarah's point it's a level of showing one's intellect that you don't have to use
(1:58:25) certain words right before we move on can I ask a question because I'm showing up late hi everybody I was up here once
(1:58:31) before um how's it going dear I remember your face pretty I think you're last
(1:58:39) time so did somebody's feelings get hurt or is this just a general conversation
(1:58:46) oh my feelings are perpetually hurt okay I think it's honestly just the the
(1:58:52) conversation actually just kind of evolved um on its own we started with the word cuck we went to all different
(1:58:58) levels of cck Tre and blah blah blah blah and now then we went into like sperging and simping and all of these
(1:59:05) different terminologies that we use across the board and how we use them um
(1:59:11) and you know how we've just kind of reshaped the words in and of of itself
(1:59:17) and now we've put just kind of it's like general for like I could just call you a simp just because you showed up on my
(1:59:22) panel and I'm a female I want to ask more about the inaccuracy of language and less about how the words make people
(1:59:28) have feelings or well then then it then it went a little further than that oh
(1:59:34) okay arbit Arbiter comes in with a $2 my feelings are hurt thank you because I've
(1:59:41) seen a lot of people get caught in feels in my time and oh my goodness that's beautiful I don't think anybody was
(1:59:48) really there like none of us were getting our feelings hurt hoping somebody General discussion at hand
(1:59:55) that's yeah but for you 10 um I want to ask generally do you do you think J
(2:00:02) Candace Owens is genuine like I've also seen her complain about cancel culture a lot and stuff like that I I don't
(2:00:08) think yeah okay okay um from what I saw about Candace Owens in a very recent
(2:00:14) video um she's so dumb that she thought her nanny was her
(2:00:20) great-grandmother just so no that's uh that's Harris she's talking about Harris oh
(2:00:27) sorry sorry sorry sorry I get I get people confused she did keep some she did keep some principles when
(2:00:34) she walked away from the daily wire I'll give her that much she's really getting into the Diddy stuff she I've never seen
(2:00:40) her so triggered as she is with this Diddy stuff so so I kind of want to um I
(2:00:46) wanted to kind of maybe steer this to a different direction so the question is
(2:00:52) if something is the way it is then I I want to ask the question why is it the way it is for instance if if the origin
(2:00:59) of a cuck is a bird a female bird that picks a good Nest provider and resource
(2:01:05) gatherer but genetically mates with a genetically superior male of the
(2:01:11) species and we attribute that in the human species as uh a
(2:01:16) malformed thought like it's it's not good these aren't good things what if in
(2:01:22) fact it actually is a good thing for the furthering of the species and uh I know
(2:01:29) I know it's going to sound crazy but I'm trying to throw the women a bone here and say instead of instead of a hand
(2:01:35) lens razor don't attribute to malice that that which could be uh explained by stupidity I don't think that I don't
(2:01:41) think these women are stupid at all I think they genetically
(2:01:48) choosing smartly perhaps or wisely um for the continuance of the species
(2:01:55) whether it's in the bird or the animal kingdom or whether it's in humans now is that a possible you know throwing them a
(2:02:02) bone if that makes any sense I I don't think humans I mean it's possible on some like
(2:02:08) subconscious level it'd be interesting to see research that proved it um but like like pheromones for example Melanie
(2:02:15) if you want like like a woman like women that are on birth control have a long relationship with a dude and then they
(2:02:21) go off birth control to have children and suddenly they're repulsed by the it does something where it blocks their
(2:02:26) pheromone yeah smells like but the thing is is like pheromones don't drive our
(2:02:32) Behavior as much as in other mammals we're much more sight based and so a lot of what drives us is physical attraction
(2:02:38) right um and so at the end of the day like that's one way like a physical
(2:02:43) attraction is still linked to genetic Health sure I don't think it is anymore in humans we see a lot of Attractive people who have a lot of health problems
(2:02:50) because it's it's pretty ubiquitous now our genes are pretty well mixed so what I I would say is I think humans are more
(2:02:57) seeking either pleasure or a longterm kind of like pair bonding situation like a mate but not like you know thinking
(2:03:05) about like what are my best genetics some some people are like I can't say nobody is right like you obviously are but I don't think it's what's commonly
(2:03:13) on woman's mind I think it's more like can this guy you know provide for me when I'm raising a damn child well he's
(2:03:19) drawing the parallel between viable mating strategy for a specific species
(2:03:25) and like maybe some women utilizing that same mating strategy in society and I I
(2:03:32) don't necessarily think it's viable for all of society obviously not but there
(2:03:38) are seemingly some women out there who do utilize that to some degree um but
(2:03:46) yeah I wasn't sure what your what your overarching point there was TS it's it's more like parents want their kids to be
(2:03:53) attractive and this isn't a sex a sexual thing but it's just we tend to perceive our kids of having a better chance of
(2:03:58) success if they're attractive I don't even know what this where this is coming from this is so irrelevant so so the the
(2:04:06) reason why I brought it up was it and I think Melanie kind of touched on it is there a subconscious level of knowing
(2:04:13) that in order for the species to survive this person has to build the nest and
(2:04:18) gather the resource and this person over here has to provide the genetic material
(2:04:23) in order on a subconscious level I'm just trying May interrupt can can I just
(2:04:29) answer him really quick rest and I'll pass it to you it really could be but the thing is it's like it's like it's outdated because like I said I don't
(2:04:35) think uh Beauty and attractiveness is necess correlates with health anymore like it used to and that's why we used
(2:04:41) to do it anyways go ahead Resto I didn't say [ __ ] yet it was actually 10 don't worry oh sorry 10 go
(2:04:46) ahead 10th you're good you're good you're good so I'm not really sure what this conversation is so I just try to
(2:04:52) put in what the way that I see things um so um I think maybe you guys are
(2:05:00) looking a little too deep into it I don't really think that like if you guys are talking talking about cuckoldry in
(2:05:08) the human species uh I would say that a large majority of
(2:05:14) cuckoldry actually is um instigated by the man because it's a roll reversal
(2:05:21) thing right so um cuz I as a gay person
(2:05:27) um sometimes the other person's the aggressor sometimes I'm the aggressor and I'm very very very
(2:05:35) educated in erotica and um things like that trust me I'm a doctor and
(2:05:45) um in all seriousness it's it's it's way less to do with genetics I believe and a
(2:05:50) whole lot more to do with just endorphins the sounds like more like
(2:05:58) degeneracy to me but go ahead no see you may see it as that
(2:06:03) but um we'll go back to Diddy that's the uh
(2:06:12) that's that's what people are talking about with did comes back to diddy at the end of the day all does come back to
(2:06:17) Diddy he was big time into great awesome um I think that has something to read out I think she has something to read
(2:06:24) thank you Resto for the $20 he says I apologize in advance now I don't know
(2:06:30) what this is referring to but let's be mindful everybody is having a great
(2:06:35) discussion here and I'd like to keep it that way I would love to have a great discussion if we're talking about coldry
(2:06:42) I think we have one of the one of the uh the the founders of [ __ ] cold on the
(2:06:47) panel right now gossipy little [ __ ]
(2:06:52) right yeah I think we have one of those people on there are you going to name me referring to me young man I am referring
(2:06:59) to you yeah you you you said everything squash if the shoe fits if the yeah
(2:07:04) everything was squash until you said something until you what's going on there man the fakest guy I've ever met
(2:07:12) in my life oh the faky actually haven't met you put it let me put it to you this
(2:07:17) way gentlemen here's what I'm going to do um because this started with a debate
(2:07:23) and we chose to open it to open Panel to actually continue the conversation I'm going to leave it at that um We're not

(2:15:00) me can you bear with me hold on grid can you bear with me for a second okay let's

(2:15:13) show okay so the thing is the thing is okay I'm sorry I'm sorry
(2:15:21) okay understood grid one said something that you didn't like but in the reality
(2:15:28) of all of this nonsense isn't that what a lot of people do on YouTube we all go
(2:15:34) to another Channel we get onto a topic it reminds us of something else somebody
(2:15:40) talks [ __ ] and okay somebody talks [ __ ] but how much [ __ ] do you talk to Resto I
(2:15:46) don't think that you can necessarily be um at the the mercy of like I'm an innocent party I've never talked [ __ ]
(2:15:53) before right and I understand the idea that men want to uh be combative and and
(2:15:59) and get it out and and take it you know spearhead it for instance I understand that but can we accept the fact that it
(2:16:07) is what it is he talks [ __ ] just don't watch him ever again like like what what
(2:16:13) are we what what are we gaining from this argument so the thing the thing about this Sarah is that the only way
(2:16:21) that he would know that and I know how he knows that is because he has some information and I have a so I have a
(2:16:28) very unique last name very unique very [ __ ] unique and there is only one way
(2:16:33) that he would know that right that means that he's being a gossipy little [ __ ] going around and getting information
(2:16:40) about me right cuz that's a very specific claim to make isn't it doing is
(2:16:45) chill bro chill chill shut the [ __ ] up I don't have time to [ __ ] talk to you

(2:17:40) if we're all yelling at each other all right we can actually have the conversation we just proved it tonight

(2:23:27) you've been dropped for 10 minutes I'm not even setting a time I like I like the word sping all you [ __ ] [ __ ] sips
(2:23:34) sping right now yes yes we all are Nev okay so let's let's let's do this
(2:23:42) gentlemen we're gonna go around the panel so I I would ask uh grid and Resto to just be mindful for a moment and
(2:23:49) thank you trib one for the possible to get a verdict from the panel that's a good question so let's go around the
(2:23:56) panel and I'd like everybody to put their two cents in for two minutes of what they think so far about this
(2:24:02) dramatic event uh starting with you 10th Man and we'll work our way around seen it a thousand times before buddy with
(2:24:09) the glasses and the hat just likes to cause trouble and the uh other guy on
(2:24:14) here is trying to get you clicks and Views and donos and more people watching by fighting the perfect formulation go
(2:24:20) ahead to you Melanie so I was going to take sides
(2:24:26) before but honestly I'm I'm realizing that there's there's no one here to truly root for um it's it's a it's a
(2:24:34) show I'm feeling kind of cucked off the panel but that I'm just being selfish so ignore
(2:24:39) me that's fair NE to you my love uh well great it did seem like a pointed uh
(2:24:46) statement to just be Conjuring so I I'm wondering if it's if there's any factual basis for
(2:24:54) it like if there's some sort of you know underlying reason why you would have that up the in the video that he showed
(2:25:02) us oh yeah no that's true that's 100% true okay your what is your belief as to
(2:25:07) why it's don't worry I'll be back all right 10 minutes Resto for you I'll set a time like why do you why do you
(2:25:12) believe that to be true because I trust a person that gave me the information okay so there's somebody in the
(2:25:19) background probably Speak Easy who not speak easy
(2:25:24) okay I mean I'll be I'll be honest it's not speak easy honestly I don't talk to Speak Easy about anything really okay
(2:25:32) the the point that I'm making is that the intensity of resto's uh energy right now seems to be informed by the
(2:25:39) seemingly baseless conjecture right well it's not baseless and he knows it otherwise he wouldn't be that pissed about it he ow child support there be a
(2:25:46) warrant hold on if if he owes child support there should be a warrant up for public information go check it out
(2:25:52) somebody's Canadian well I didn't say that he was a child support I said that he was um hiding out there for um
(2:25:58) because his U family is involved with BLM but that's irrelevant how about you trippy how about you trippy have you
(2:26:05) been watching so far I uh I had to set up everything so I missed a good chunk
(2:26:11) of what's going on but like if resto's fighting somebody I'm probably going to be on Resto side it's gonna be well let
(2:26:17) me let me share let me that's fair that's cool yeah I like grid I like I like Speak Easy I like everybody let me
(2:26:24) uh bring you up to speed we have um this clip uh that I'll play One More Time
(2:26:33) BLM that Resco cheso guy his his family was part of that that's why he's hiding
(2:26:38) out in [ __ ] Korea because part of his family's part of [ __ ] BLM no [ __ ]
(2:26:45) dude no [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] that guy dude that's BLM the okay so that's where
(2:26:52) we stand on that and so Resto is making the uh claim that grid is you know
(2:27:00) essentially kind of spreading lies on another panel no he didn't say I spread lies or well know why I said it he he's
(2:27:08) not denying it because it's true whatever the case may be sure heed
(2:27:13) it yeah he did because he did say like do you want to know why I'm doing this and here's why XYZ but either way
(2:27:20) whether Resto is mad at grid for saying that on a panel on a completely
(2:27:26) different panel that has nothing to do with mine but here nothing to do with it but like why why do you think that is
(2:27:33) that just like a a guess or no no no no it came from Resto himself and he knows
(2:27:39) it all right and I mean like if if Resto was part of
(2:27:45) BLM I mean part of BLM he lot of other people
(2:27:50) who donated to BLM and had no idea that there was ulterior motives you know what I mean sure I'm
(2:27:58) not a supporter of it but back when I I was the guy on my own Facebook you
(2:28:03) know my family it's not worthwhile to get yeah
(2:28:09) okay it's just not worthwhile to get into as much fun as it would be because I'm I'm actually now I'm awake and I'm
(2:28:16) having a good time and it's fun maybe rusto is not really black and he's just just been wearing a filter from Facebook
(2:28:22) or something could be I don't know and uh Arbiter PID uh was the one who originally paid to boot Resto but he has
(2:28:29) requested to bring Resto back now so oh wow so thank you Arbiter for being compl
(2:28:36) it's fun to fight on the internet Sarah there we go sometimes sometimes but as
(2:28:41) long as it doesn't go outside of the internet in most cases right yes I think
(2:28:47) when people go to the next level and attack people personally at home or whatever the case may be I think that's
(2:28:54) where lines should be absolutely drawn that's big no no keep the fight on the
(2:28:59) internet do your thing um okay has the panel had the ability to make its piece
(2:29:05) or did anybody else aside from Resto and grid have some thoughts I just want to
(2:29:11) thank trippy cast for being here your energies are exactly what we need right now yes trippy I love trippy that
(2:29:17) actually me happy um so here's the thing grit my family I am not hang on I got
(2:29:24) hang on one second my volume turned down give me one second there you go turn it up keep
(2:29:29) going all right so my family I will not deny that a half of my family yes I'm
(2:29:37) going full a nuke I don't care anymore I do not associate with them I have do you
(2:29:42) know I have not seen anybody with my last name besides my daughter ever do
(2:29:47) you know that so the fact that you know that right means that somebody told you
(2:29:53) and there's only one [ __ ] person one person that will tell you that and since
(2:29:58) you're saying that I'm being a gossipy little [ __ ] you're going around being a gossipy I never said you were a gossipy
(2:30:04) little [ __ ] I said that shut up let me [ __ ] finish my goddamn statement sit in the corner and think about your
(2:30:09) goddamn actions now you know what [ __ ] you [ __ ] [ __ ] you my [ __ ] [ __ ] you
(2:30:16) who the [ __ ] are you you're nobody you're less than nobody you got a shitty life and I'm sorry but
(2:30:23) we were so close but GD cannot just he cannot just handle truth he cannot handle facts all right let's let's
(2:30:29) finish finish your thought Resto and then grid you can respond now grid you're going around
(2:30:36) being a gossipy little [ __ ] the only reason that I'm mad is because I have a very unique name and you know probably
(2:30:44) at this point right you probably know who I am the fact is my daughter has that same last name and I am not
(2:30:50) virtually zling at all at this point I'm just saying you should just stop going around being a gossipy little [ __ ] and
(2:30:56) saying things that you don't know that uh for facts saying that I live in Korea because I'm going around [ __ ]
(2:31:03) avoiding uh America because I'm a part of BLM not true at all I live in Korea to make my [ __ ] family comfortable I
(2:31:09) have the facilities to live anywhere the [ __ ] I want to on Earth so I think that you should check yourself before you get
(2:31:15) [ __ ] wrecked okay [ __ ] around and [ __ ] find out grid end statement
(2:31:20) okay to you GD you stop talking about me and I'll stop talking about you you started this
(2:31:27) [ __ ] and I will continue and I will finish it talk about these nuts hold on
(2:31:33) hold on Resto let him you go War we have War it's War then [ __ ] it's
(2:31:41) War then [ __ ] don't go to war with somebody who actually goes to war [ __ ] you don't go to war you talk like a [ __ ] behind people's backs mhm ask ask
(2:31:50) I don't got Ops whatever you can you can you can stand in line after them at the Pearly Gates [ __ ] yeah
(2:32:00) okay everybody feel better like hamburgers does everybody feel better I like I like cheeseburgers better than
(2:32:06) hamburgers I think one of has got a pop trunk um on which car let's talk about
(2:32:13) food love oh my goodness it's so it's wonderful what were we talking about
(2:32:18) again uh that's what we're watching right now black lives mattering oh no I don't want
(2:32:25) that and they do and they do we're not going on that topic uh yeah
(2:32:31) we can get back to co uh we start business called chickens
(2:32:37) lay eggs I can get some support GD hasn't breathed this hard in a long time
(2:32:42) this is the most exercise he's gotten in [ __ ]
(2:32:48) months n me to I just I don't even understand what the what the what the
(2:32:54) claim that greatest Z like where's the shame in that statement like like an
(2:33:01) American thing or that we were talking about that chesto is all pissed off about but what but it's okay but like as
(2:33:08) like some sort of like uh did you not see the two of us laughing when we were talking about it it was fine yeah but
(2:33:14) like fair enough but I think like where is the the sh why is soad why is he so
(2:33:22) mad well it's an open conversation for both of you I'm curious he doesn't want his daughter being involved in Internet
(2:33:29) drama that's I didn't say anything about his daughter yeah his name with the
(2:33:34) internet drama stuff it only goes so far before it's out of your hands like if you're the one that starts it or I'm not
(2:33:40) saying you're starting drama I'm just saying well you know somebody kept talking about me on panels and when they
(2:33:47) agreed not to and if you [ __ ] Break The Rules you get [ __ ] during the I
(2:33:53) think that I think that uh at the end of the day the proper response is to just
(2:34:00) pretend somebody doesn't exist I like to play that game it's a fun game to play like I just pretend they fell off the
(2:34:06) face of the Earth and I don't acknowledge their existence especially especially if they don't like me they
(2:34:13) say me things about me or whatever we have plenty of those people yeah um and it's I just pretend dead you know it's
(2:34:21) just easier um gentlemen I think if you guys can stay in your Corners you can talk
(2:34:28) all the [ __ ] you want on a different panel um you can talk all the [ __ ] you
(2:34:33) want and do all of those things minutes whin and that's fine and
(2:34:39) that's fine but I think that if we just pretend that the other one doesn't exist don't watch [ __ ] don't watch bad [ __ ]
(2:34:47) people say about you number one it's incredi toxic to your health number two it's not good for you it's not doing any
(2:34:54) you're not gaining anything I used to watch all of that [ __ ] and I was like why am I wasting my time watching
(2:35:00) somebody you know say such ill will about me no I'm not going to do it so I
(2:35:06) think the my recommendation would be stay in your Corners you you obviously don't typically panel together um it I I
(2:35:15) don't see you guys really like on panels sharing conversations so I don't think we have to worry about that you don't
(2:35:21) even like really play in the same Arena um so I think at the end of the day you
(2:35:27) should be fine if you just stay in your corners and don't watch each other [ __ ] that was what I want to know what I
(2:35:35) want to know is who made the guy aware that that other guy was talking
(2:35:41) about him because he probably wasn't watching it so really what you got to think about is whoever sent you the link
(2:35:47) or the clip it doesn't it was a big they're the one they're the one behind the scenes that's trying to cause this
(2:35:55) you guys don't look at what's going on I know we all know e well even at that
(2:36:02) okay I know told him will say did not tell me [ __ ] Speak Easy for a second
(2:36:08) gentlemen I am talking what is the number one role I have on this panel I
(2:36:13) just have one thank you um it wouldn't matter who sent it to him people send me
(2:36:18) [ __ ] about of people talking about me all the time and I just I just ignore it I don't click on it I don't care you
(2:36:25) know I'm not going to waste my time or energy I have very minimal time to care so it doesn't necessarily matter who
(2:36:31) sent it and you can chalk them up as like oh they're a fire starter a drama starter whatever and we know that
(2:36:38) there's those people out there they always know everything of what's going on and always somehow end up telling the
(2:36:44) person who's being talked about like yo such and such is talking about you you know that fine it's going to happen but
(2:36:51) what you choose to do with that information is what defines who you are what's that saying uh you can tell like
(2:36:59) tell about a man based on what angers him right and if another man talking
(2:37:04) [ __ ] about you pisses you off then I think that you guys have more to think
(2:37:09) about internally versus what you have to say about each
(2:37:17) other thank you thank
(2:37:22) damn well that's how we mom around here look just don't go down on the
(2:37:29) [ __ ] Titanic that's all I'm saying get off the boat I I'm pretty
(2:37:35) sick of like this whole gossip culture to be honest oh my God shut up Fox this has nothing to do with you don't [ __ ]
(2:37:40) with the fox I second that I seconding this completely you're the one coming on here
(2:37:46) sperging out on grid and grid spering out on you we were all having a really
(2:37:52) nice conversation and getting along just fine until this [ __ ] started now we now we're at a peaceful
(2:37:58) place don't come in trying to stir [ __ ] with my little fox friend you're right I
(2:38:03) apologize in advance I already KN I came in here knowing that I was going to [ __ ] this [ __ ] up I already knew that I'm
(2:38:09) sorry understood but now that it's done mommy has spoken now we're going to get
(2:38:15) back to whatever the panel wants to talk about Melanie whatever you were saying after I read the Super Chat please go
(2:38:22) ahead Arbiter coming in with the $2 I can neither confirm nor or deny I did
(2:38:27) not snitch yeah same here same here we all thought it was the
(2:38:34) Orbiter wa no I don't know anything Melanie you were midth thought before you were rudely interrupted so the floor
(2:38:40) is yours thank you um yeah I just I don't personally get off much to to
(2:38:46) drama content um I feel like I need someone to kind of explain to me like what's in it for you when you when when
(2:38:53) you watch it if anyone here does watch it or just like what are people watching it for Yeah so basically sometimes on
(2:38:59) panels there's like personalities and they can act aloof or like they're in a
(2:39:05) moral High position for some reason and then somebody will come along and then sort of shatter that self-perception
(2:39:12) they have for themselves and a lot of people really enjoy that sort of content because what you're doing is you're
(2:39:17) injecting that person with self-awareness um and even if they don't get it they can watch it back later on and then
(2:39:23) maybe come to their conclusion themselves do do you understand that sure that's why I debate
(2:39:29) people okay well then you understand why I'm telling you don't you think like the debate
(2:39:36) format and just kind of like the back and forth is better than the screaming over each other and talking past each
(2:39:43) other I'm I enjoy it I enjoy it I grew up in a I have four brothers um it it
(2:39:49) just it's just dinner time as far as I'm concerned and crack Laing coming with
(2:39:54) the $2 listen to your mommy yes I think I'm going to dub myself as the YouTube
(2:40:00) mob now Mel isn't here oh I even think like you're you're probably one of the
(2:40:06) best panel hosts in the scene whatever you're being paid it isn't enough I get paid whatever you guys give
(2:40:12) me exactly exactly donate to Sarah maybe for for every [ __ ] starter
(2:40:18) like they have to pay in advance like Resto we're going to start start a thing like you have to apologize in
(2:40:25) advance so you're sorry with donations so apologize I do apologize
(2:40:31) Sarah like it could have been anybody's panel it's nothing personal I think I
(2:40:37) think typically Pro based on the circles that you guys hang in uh grid is likely
(2:40:42) not going to be on a panel that you have access to um not going to be on a panel that you have the ability to get on
(2:40:49) whether the host will allow you or whether the the link is um privately exchanged or not so I think that you
(2:40:56) found an opportunity because I happen to uh be associated with both of you um and
(2:41:02) you took it which I understand and it's kind of like what this channel thrives
(2:41:08) on is allowing me to mod uh crazy [ __ ] so
(2:41:13) understood um but we could have definitely you know had a better warning shot you know in a different way because
(2:41:20) we were on such a nice conversation so yeah um I don't typically uh give
(2:41:26) warning shots but I do want to say I apologize not to GD [ __ ] GD but I
(2:41:31) apologize to [ __ ] you too it's okay don't worry about it the audience y'all were loving this

(2:41:57) off my wife after this bro I'm gonna have the great sex I'm have great sex see how horn epic got
(2:42:04) him 10 man I can smell her making french toast downstairs right now I had french

(2:43:01) and his big body fat ass [ __ ] his five miles to the gallon looking ass [ __ ] his
(2:43:06) the reason they made double Do's ass so he can go through [ __ ] doors [ __ ] grid stop talking about my [ __ ]
(2:43:12) family it was very good I'm very [ __ ] funny if you actually listen you're not F that short ass sitting down ass [ __ ]

(2:43:32) yeah okay I I don't think you I don't think you guys should make any form of agreement to not talk about no because
(2:43:39) you won't follow it that's why I won't make any agreement well I think that's hold on gentlemen I think that that is
(2:43:45) uh kind of out the window and we should just accept but what I will say what I will say is
(2:43:53) just stay out of each other's Corners right obviously Beed to do that obviously you're both welcome here and I
(2:44:00) don't mind having you both on panel as long as we're engaging in the discussion and we're not going to bring more of the
(2:44:06) the crazy drama stuff back up um but you know if you both stay in your Corners do
(2:44:12) your own thing and stop watching each other's [ __ ] I don't watches [ __ ] grit no no one watches grid who watches

(2:45:35) debate that Andrew had tonight oh I missed the whole debate part like I clicked on the stream when I was in the
(2:45:41) bathroom and I was having like you know some fun in the bathroom not so much fun my stomach but uh you know trippy I was
(2:45:48) in there I was tearing it up and I was typing to people in chat they were like join tripping I'm like I'm in the bathroom tearing it up is crazy dude I
(2:45:55) was destroying that toilet like I went in there with all my bondage gear and I started smacking the
(2:46:00) toilet with a cat and N Tails I can't even be mad trippy how was trippy how was your birthday did you guys like do a
(2:46:06) movie stream or something yeah we watched uh Happy death day one and two and my ass fell

(2:46:18) right all right sir I'm going to let you go um sorry in advance well not in advance sorry for this now we're getting
(2:46:25) into my expertise it's not [ __ ] over I'm going full nuke on everybody I don't give a [ __ ] I don't care anymore
(2:46:32) speaking of which what's even what's your beef with me [ __ ] you [ __ ] I've never come at
(2:46:39) you it's cuz you're annoying M you're super fuing only annoy the worst people
(2:46:45) you are actually insufferable I don't I the last three four months of you not
(2:46:51) being on the internet was the best time of my life and you have emerged through the sludge once again okay what's your
(2:46:59) beef with me come on you guys the speed date now yes yes
(2:47:04) we chicken all right hamburgers how you doing
(2:47:11) Neeve I'm doing well thanks how are you I'm all right I'm enjoying my time here
(2:47:17) okay here are some very is criticisms okay number one when you're in a
(2:47:23) conversation when there's like something being discussed and you have like a
(2:47:28) bunch of moving components you are really good at like we're talking
(2:47:34) about uh let's say we're talking about um I don't know the animal kingdom okay
(2:47:42) we're talking about the animal kingdom we're talking about the Dynamics that the animals face with human beings and
(2:47:49) you're going to like halt the discussion to talk about this one very specific
(2:47:55) breed of like Chihuahuas that does like a cool thing that you think is like
(2:48:01) relevant to the discussion this is just like a consistent pattern with you are you saying people don't love Chihuahuas
(2:48:08) I love Chihuahuas I do not love when they're being used to derail
(2:48:13) discussions you're bastardizing Chihuahuas it's a double-edged sword to be sure like my I like to go deep in
(2:48:20) these things it if I'm sorry if you find that annoying but I think also some people do appreciate it because if
(2:48:26) they're interested in the topic knowing more about that topic is inherently more interesting but well so we're if they're
(2:48:32) talking about the macro pieces of that topic and you zoom in so much are we
(2:48:38) really talking about that topic are we talking about like an ant in the context of like the Ant Hill do you know what
(2:48:45) I'm saying like sure I my personal experience is that people often do refer back to me when I do that um I try to be
(2:48:52) helpful but I can also see what you're saying that that can sometimes just block things up okay second are you
(2:48:58) ready for the second criticism okay criticism number two you have this
(2:49:04) really weird way of attempting to like play nice with people from different
(2:49:09) ideological backgrounds and whatever else and it's cute that's fine however
(2:49:15) we both know that you're about as left as they get very Progressive laugh or I
(2:49:21) don't know how you would sure and you seem to find and
(2:49:26) pick very specific issues with sort of people who detract from your like larger
(2:49:33) worldview and then you will Pearl clutch about those sorts of things until you're
(2:49:39) so insufferable that you get like removed or bound from a community multiple multiple occasion I have like
(2:49:45) three or four communities in mind that I think of okay so I guess I need you to elaborate cuz I've seen people do the
(2:49:52) same thing about me and that's I'm not saying that's okay um it's just often times like people are like pretty bad
(2:49:59) and me saying like by the way these people are pretty bad like I think we're all kind of doing that around here right
(2:50:06) yeah so in this conversation you would have like particip so here's an example of something that I would see you do so
(2:50:12) you would say that using the AR slur is probably not a good thing it is like uh
(2:50:18) consequences for people who aren't involved in the discussion therefore we shouldn't use the word or the tone or
(2:50:24) whatever all of that stuff matters right you think about the people who are external to the
(2:50:30) discussion okay but there are people who don't NE okay
(2:50:35) so that you're talking about we shouldn't use words right oh yeah and I'm think about people now I get what
(2:50:42) you mean sorry okay so you'll you'll bring up an argument like we shouldn't use the arser okay and then you will
(2:50:48) participate on a panel with people who have no issues with using that arser but when it comes convenient for you let's
(2:50:55) say in the future Sarah sers on you and she decides she no longer likes you well then we're going to see you skito out in
(2:51:02) the chat talking about all the usages of the RW all the certain people that use
(2:51:08) it the one time she used it like this is just a weird thing that you do where you try and play like both sides to a
(2:51:15) situation but are also super quick to kind of like flip the script and pearl
(2:51:21) clutch uh when something's like inconvenient for you to the point that like you get blocked and banned out of
(2:51:27) like communities sure I won't deny I've been blocked and banned out of some communities not all of them of course
(2:51:32) like five four or five that I can think okay thanks that's reasonable um that's that's a lot for not for some but uh you
(2:51:41) know I think that's fair at least and I'll uh I'll just say that you know it p
(2:51:47) uh perceptive or percept are subjective so I wouldn't blame you for thinking
(2:51:52) that necessarily but I I think it kind of goes both ways with this sort of thing where um you know I I try to
(2:51:59) reciprocate what people give to me if people are G let Me on their platform they're they listen to me and stuff like
(2:52:05) that listen to them um and if they show me a different side of them then I think
(2:52:10) it's just natural that I show a different side of myself yeah I think you're [ __ ] crazy
(2:52:17) speaking of letting people that mean that's not a criticism it is a very big criticism I think when people see you in
(2:52:24) that moment where you are Pearl couching and you are spurgo spurgo spurg skito in
(2:52:30) a chat to try and diminish the person that you're talking to because you don't like the sort of tone or the talking
(2:52:36) points that that person has then I think that maybe they'll see a different side of to what I'm saying right but I mean
(2:52:42) there's no interest in I have no interest in people not liking you because I don't like you I don't know I've had plenty of disagreements where I
(2:52:48) don't start beef with people everything's fine certain people seem to take these disagreements way more
(2:52:53) seriously than I do and if they would just start going back to treating me normally then I treat them normally
(2:52:59) that's usually how it works okay well and this is beyond all of think being as reason all the major
(2:53:05) Community criticisms and all the other things if you keep waving that hilarious sensored thing around I'm going to have
(2:53:11) to sensor you because I cannot talk while I'm laughing it's like the all of that stuff
(2:53:19) th those are those are wider points yeah have more things against me oh absolutely these are specific
(2:53:27) things that I've noticed but I think prior to this in your lore uh I would say two more two big
(2:53:34) ones that's turn at my head okay can't we all just get along can I ask a
(2:53:39) question before you get on to the other things are both of you guys are both are
(2:53:44) both of you guys gay oh my God I'm just ask because I am gay so I'm
(2:53:51) just asking are you both of you guys gay well I'm not interested um no I'm asking are you gay
(2:54:00) Melanie I'm getting the impression that you are and uh yeah that's why I don't
(2:54:06) like other gay people uh Melanie I saw you in my in uh in my green room the
(2:54:12) other night um it's just I only allow so many people up on my panel at a time oh yeah I understand okay good I I didn't
(2:54:19) want you you left before I could bring you up and and say anything so oh no I totally understood and you said that
(2:54:25) during the panel too that's a good panel thank you I appreciate that I hope I can make it to one in the future yeah yeah
(2:54:32) it was uh we don't um we don't actually get I have
(2:54:37) um we actually you know it we don't get surprise guests uh that much because I I
(2:54:43) try and schedule everything and and all of that but um it was good it it would have been cool to have you up
(2:54:48) and I just remember this now I'm sorry about the link thing I didn't even know that you had you know tried to put it
(2:54:54) out carefully proncess just said he had the link and invited me along sure and I don't think any it wasn't I wasn't mad
(2:55:00) about it it's it was just weird that there were just random people popping into the green room and I'm like what the hell and Ava even like DMD me said
(2:55:08) to to like tell you that she really did not hand out the link so I think there was just you know chain of custody with mods maybe they didn't it doesn't really
(2:55:15) matter it's just um I I just run my show a little differently than than other people run theirs because I have a very
(2:55:22) specific aim and and trajectory for my show so cool you do racing right well I
(2:55:28) used to I'm retired now well that makes sense at least to be kind of like focused in that way on what's Ahad of you he said the arler oh he said retired
(2:55:36) okay yeah yeah all
(2:55:41) the I'm sorry trippy cast I missed that oh and in Deadpool and Wolverine at one point like you know they get I don't
(2:55:48) know if I'm giving away too many spoilers if you haven't seen the movie but Wesley Snipes was in there as blade
(2:55:54) and like Ryan Reynolds or Deadpool says to him at one point he goes I think I thought you were retired and he looks at
(2:56:00) him he goes [ __ ] and he's like no I said reti retired that's funny that's funny it's
(2:56:06) like yeah actually no I'm very that wasn't funny I'm very offended I'm not not funny not funny unaccept I'm just kidding yeah I know I was so offended
(2:56:13) and my butt itched you know you feel it in your tailbone the whole movie is offensively
(2:56:18) boring but no that's just my opinion that's just my opinion if you like the movie good for you that's fine that like it's Cameo heavy but
(2:56:26) everything from Marvel is now Cameo heavy so you must have really liked the Marvels
(2:56:31) then me yeah I'm just not big into the superhero stuff um what kind of movies
(2:56:38) do you like I I really like him into Star Wars right now and just kind of I guess like cinematic universes that are
(2:56:45) big like like the newest one the acolyte you like the acolyte no no but I did like um Ahsoka Ahsoka it didn't finish
(2:56:51) the greatest but it like at the whole show just went really hard um and really like paid homage to the old series well
(2:56:59) um but like I I don't know I whenever I look at superhero movies especially past like the early 2000s era it just seems
(2:57:07) so fanservicey and that always bored bores me like you can almost predict what's going to happen in the sense that
(2:57:13) like you may not know who's going to like appear but you know that they're going to have someone appear in the movie to make crowd go woo and then it's
(2:57:20) like okay well you know that old yeah why why would we ever want our
(2:57:25) childhood dreams of the things that we imagined to come true in cinematography
(2:57:31) why would we want that I'm just boring like that okay if you enjoy it like I'm not telling you not to it's just for me
(2:57:36) like I'm the sort of person who like just seems like no you're the type of person that thinks that this type of attitude where you're you know snidey
(2:57:43) and stuff like that Mak seem interesting but no yeah I am a bit of a snob I I'm
(2:57:49) like ma'am ma'am the ter you're looking for whatever might be
(2:57:55) hipster all righty well I would love to sit here and debate Marvel with a Furby
(2:58:01) and a gay dude but I have to go do some laundry so thank you so much Sarah oh
(2:58:06) we're not debating Marvel we're debating psychology whatever you're doing is
(2:58:12) worse talk to you guys L have a good night bye wash your skibbies
(2:58:18) by the way may I just point out in my defense I tried to take all of her criticisms as constructively as
(2:58:24) possible I did my best and but I you know I I have my standards I know myself so I also stood up for myself a bit
(2:58:31) if I'm okay people not liking me that's all um yeah it's okay to take criticisms it's okay to give criticisms and I think
(2:58:38) when it's done in the proper you know channel uh or Direction I think that it
(2:58:44) kind of uh you can actually adjust it later and do something with that information as
(2:58:50) you need to the problem is I've been aware of this criticism for a long time and it's
(2:58:56) kind of just one-sided but you know to the extent that I could use it I have and that's why I'm here talking to you
(2:59:02) guys cordially and not being like Oh my God trippy made a joke with the arser not that I actually ever would well I
(2:59:09) try to say it with a bunch of extra letters um I found out that the movie The Flash is literally melatonin in
(2:59:16) movie form so like if you guys need to go to SLE put on the flash only are the newest flash that
(2:59:24) funny the the one with ER why do I keep want to see the movie no one can no one can't uh isra Miller and uh yeah that
(2:59:32) one and Michael ke had the time travel and all that yeah the Michael Keaton parts will keep you focused but they're
(2:59:37) not until like past halfway through I like that movie I like to watch it when I need to go to sleep that what's your
(2:59:44) favorite movie that came out in the last five years [ __ ]
(2:59:49) I don't know uh that honestly probably that Halloween 2018
(2:59:55) movie was that five years that's more than five years [ __ ] yeah I got to address what tenth men said about me so
(3:00:01) I am a snob but the I think the problem is that um I said snide but yeah self
(3:00:06) identify go ahead the problem is is that like I have good reason to because not only have do I like episodes 1 through
(3:00:13) six of Star Wars I realized you have to watch it in the reverse order than the
(3:00:18) chronological one so you actually have to watch episode one first and then it actually it works so much
(3:00:25) better we never got that opportunity right because we would have saw the originals and the other ones I'm not
(3:00:31) staying here if he's here uh Sarah you don't notice I was texting you Sarah and
(3:00:37) I stopped when um NE left I was about to say this is got to be Gold T the
(3:00:43) ne left I love NE I love sense energy
(3:00:49) they are the exact same person that can go great when them two [ __ ] would have been on F together it could
(3:00:55) have been great oh yeah and Sarah that that reminds me if you are going to like
(3:01:00) turn on me um just just DM me so we can coordinate let you know make better
(3:01:07) content right because I feel like like one of the problems is like you start beefing with somebody but then you don't you don't you don't coordinate and say
(3:01:13) like what does the audience want right how do we make this even better you just just going after each other the whole
(3:01:18) time like no we're we're performers right we've got to start like it's I
(3:01:23) actually started to understand wrestling once I realized this um it's not fake right the the violence is real but you
(3:01:29) have to be on the same page because when buddy punches you in the face you've got to like you know it's got to be part of
(3:01:35) that that's like look like I know what's happening right now you don't want your fight or flight to come take over and then you're just like you know you're BL

(3:06:13) good well I mean footsteps imperative biological imperative was that Neeve
(3:06:19) that wanted to have that conversation that was Melanie okay yeah I'm the I'm the bio girl I guess especially
(3:06:26) according to ne's description of me got to get into micro
(3:06:33) specifics just gonna run away that's how I
(3:06:39) run what were we talking about I'm sorry I broke everything I'm waiting for the the bio
(3:06:46) discussion to start I'm not kicking it off I thought you wanted wanted to have it oh that no I was I was joking about
(3:06:53) like going back to that as a joke what's your prompt you know okay all right um men don't think as well when they're
(3:07:02) horny okay post nut Clarity I guess you'd have to have post
(3:07:08) nut the only way to have post-nut Clarity is to have uh uh Stupid brain yeah yeah thank you
(3:07:17) prenut confusion pre pre prenut cloudiness but seriously like looking at the the just the state of all humans
(3:07:24) today how did we actually managed to keep procreating to this point uh when a man and a woman love
(3:07:32) each [Laughter] other I think you know the rest when a
(3:07:39) bird and a bee meet in a tree I don't have anything after that is like is it
(3:07:45) really ethical to have a child though when like clate change is about to happen not calling any parents out by
(3:07:50) the way you're fine prove it climate change happened during melan Ice Age and
(3:07:56) there's no way humans caused it so climate change is going to happen no matter what that's my argument let's
(3:08:02) have this climate change because I'm I'm 5 changes over time that's just what happens it doesn't matter if we're yeah
(3:08:09) started getting cold a couple weeks ago I'm terrified exactly that's what I'm saying like if humans weren't here
(3:08:14) climate would still be changing we we as humans we act as if we're way more [ __ ] important than we are and we're
(3:08:21) just not that damn important we don't have that much yeah they don't care about Bill Gates want to change the
(3:08:28) weather they don't care about the stuff that's actually happening right we're worried about Bill Gates is a doctor
(3:08:36) yeah Bill Bill Gates wants to be a doctor he taught us all how to get the injections you know um no now they're
(3:08:42) all nasal inject uh inhalants right that's even scarier because the here let
(3:08:47) me let me use my Q-tip on you 10th man I I I can't Ser I can't I got I went to
(3:08:56) the doctor here recently after they got me to do an MRI and I'm like well then
(3:09:01) why doesn't my hand work and they're like I don't know and and and then they're like uh I'm like well then how
(3:09:08) how you GNA try to tell me it's the vaccine we that that I don't think that's what it was okay so it's magic
(3:09:15) it's just magic so is your gold to get Sarah like demonetized here and like I'm
(3:09:20) not trying show noted or whatever we talked about climate you know and then the I've been trying to get the show
(3:09:26) note on my own channel thing doesn't get people demonetized does it I've been trying to get the show
(3:09:31) notes on on what side of it you're on if you're uh If you deny it I've seen get
(3:09:37) demonetized so so so like I want to see proof of that generally specific what do you think about Diddy well oh my God
(3:09:45) Arbiter comes in with a $2 and say says give Melanie the melatonin tablets it's
(3:09:51) time to put you to sleep I'll give you a link to The Flash movie put your two
(3:09:56) minute time out no I think he's just saying to go to sleep what did I do I
(3:10:02) don't know I want to know what Joe thinks about Diddy because I sent Joe in a
(3:10:07) group text like literally six months ago when all that began cuz my husband's
(3:10:12) like gets deep into this stuff I can't remember her name like Lamborghini or po por or something like that the lady
(3:10:18) who's always doing all these interviews she's on Pierce Morgan recently yeah yeah and um I sent it to Joe long time
(3:10:25) ago and they're like no and then even my husband the other day was like there was this video of uh tunnels that went to
(3:10:32) either Oprah's host or Michael Jackson's house or something like that and my husband was like no I I don't think that
(3:10:38) that's real and then it was real like I actually saw the body cam video of the cops that went through it and I'm like
(3:10:43) woohoo woo Who do you see the rosan thing where now Roseanne's saying why a whole bunch of people started hating me
(3:10:50) a couple years ago after a really bad thing that happened where there was like 473 officers that took 70 something
(3:10:57) minutes to respond blah blah blah blah blah that stuff and I said exactly the same thing Roseanne's saying and
(3:11:04) everybody called me crazy and we're gonna find out it's true that they're vampires what about Kanye West oh that's
(3:11:10) interesting you're talking about that because I had a theory that the whole French Revolution was actually The
(3:11:17) Peasants started to find out that the aristocrats were actually doing precisely kind of in a doing rituals and
(3:11:24) drinking the blood of their children and abducting their children and then they found out about it but history books
(3:11:30) tried to cover it up because they wanted it to stay in like a mythology kind of thing you
(3:11:36) know but uh that's an interesting premise I don't know if you're being serious with it or not but uh I think you might be on to something there yeah
(3:11:43) who who do you next though I'm saying wait we're just GNA let this vampire
(3:11:48) thing walk away hey I'm saying well you
(3:11:53) maybe are there are there are there parents in the world right now who are using their children for
(3:12:02) blood doping to extend their life and give them health benefits is that happening right now is that what it's
(3:12:08) called it's called blood transfusions it's called blood doping yeah think about Ellen degenerous and how she was
(3:12:14) talking about those uh those different what was it like lotions for people that have uh have like blood from babies in
(3:12:21) there or whatever is like some kind of Weir stem cells from fetuses or something in your uh in your lotion you
(3:12:27) put it on your face yeah actually I don't know it might have been blood I can't remember exactly I watch too many
(3:12:33) it was actually uh it was actually Four skins from uh oh four Skins faci are they delicious the
(3:12:41) problem though is that um the blood doesn't actually carry I'm fond of them oh okay may like like prenatal babies
(3:12:48) but like in like newborn babies and stuff they don't have a lot of stem cells in their blood so it wouldn't make
(3:12:54) as much sense for them to be vampires some people might be doing it as like one of those crazy Health fats like I mean people drink bleach as a health fat
(3:13:03) so uh you you can whiten your teeth pretty easy with it but they're not going to last for much longer
(3:13:09) afterwards yeah especially since the chlorine replaces the Florine and the bleach traps inside of the tooth and it
(3:13:15) rots it that's why uh uh that's that's why George Washington and other politicians of that time frame lost all
(3:13:20) their teeth is because they were whitening those guys teeth for public appearances and it it just ended up
(3:13:26) rotting their teeth out of their skulls worth it mhm and and in Washington he didn't have wooden teeth those things
(3:13:33) were made out of steel and they had Springs on them and [ __ ] they were painful that's why he always took them out oh they Springs stuff his cheeks
(3:13:39) with h cotton for painting well if you guys ever thought about where they come up with all these different mythologies
(3:13:45) like uh the yeti um Bigfoot dog men vampires werewolves
(3:13:53) um forgot to set my own stream up you know it's quite interesting to me because it seems like it's it's based on
(3:13:59) something right there's something there in in the mythology right uh most
(3:14:04) cultures have like a like a flood narrative yeah I mean most most like if
(3:14:12) we're starting from like the most basic the kids stories always start out as like ways to kids into doing stuff right
(3:14:18) and some of these at least like when I think of Bigfoot I think of like don't go into the woods right cuz you know
(3:14:25) they some kids might think like a wolf is a puppy dog or something or like a bear isn't really that scary but if you
(3:14:31) tell them like there's this 10 foot ma furry man thing that wants to tear you
(3:14:36) in half well then maybe it's easier for kids to understand that then animals
(3:14:42) want to I I don't know why we did that so much in the past but we certainly tried to scare kids is all I know so
(3:14:48) what you're saying is that it's some first world problems that you've been so protected that you don't believe that
(3:14:54) horrible things can happen that nature does some pretty diabolical things that if you let your kids wander around in
(3:14:59) the forested [ __ ] first by a wolf or a coyote when did I say that I just said
(3:15:06) that we I that reason you're saying that the world's not as scary as it really is and
(3:15:12) I would say actually because we have first world problems it's actually a lot more insolated and protected than it
(3:15:18) than it should be um and arbiter coming in with the $2
(3:15:23) yeah it's a glitch in The Matrix and duh oh yeah I've seen the animatrix but I
(3:15:29) haven't seen the cleanup crew yet it's all a Mandela effect all of it it's all a Mandela
(3:15:36) effect uh we come from a different dimension and we smashed Earths together and they were like smash smash smash and
(3:15:42) then they gave birth to this earth and now we all live on it and it's it's all need
(3:15:48) not here never mind sorry it's all Melanie's fault oh thank you no that was the flash yeah yeah oh yeah The Flash
(3:15:55) ran too fast and he caused the break the the flash point and um now now Batman is
(3:16:01) not Bruce Wayne he's he's Thomas Wayne I think 10th Man to like I guess like
(3:16:07) overall like address your point to what I do believe uh it's said that we've pretty much confirmed that most of these
(3:16:13) things aren't really there in the sense that like ghost for example are way better explained by sensory deprivation
(3:16:20) especially like way back when when there was no like electrical humming or like street lights and stuff like that and
(3:16:26) your senses were cut off from any sound any light and you know that's probably
(3:16:32) when Creeks start sounding incredibly loud and even the slightest light looks like some like an an orb floating in the
(3:16:38) middle of the room because you aren't using your depth perception yet because you're in PCH
(3:16:43) black that makes sense I mean it uh you ever been in a completely silent place
(3:16:50) trying to go to sleep your brain starts wandering your mind starts making up things I prefer that so has anybody here
(3:16:57) ever seen a phenomenon a ghost an apparition an alien a uh UFO anything
(3:17:03) like that ever no my real question was has anyone ever met one like like
(3:17:09) actually like interacted with it I've seen a UFO too many times okay so what happen I've had so
(3:17:15) much sex with ghosts and alien in Northern Alberta a triangle shaped
(3:17:21) rocks thing goes across the northern lights and not all Northern Lights are
(3:17:26) those ribbons of colors instead it was a white like Sheen over the sky and I grew
(3:17:33) up next to an Air Force Base so I've even seen the stealth bomber take off and land and you know so I know what
(3:17:40) aircraft no wory self bombers do that in Alberta too that's super cool actually no and this was way way bigger than any
(3:17:47) airplane you've ever seen sure it was gigantic and it had it seemed like it
(3:17:53) had holes through it it looked like the onsolve mysteries from the 80s it was triangle and had light holes and or
(3:18:01) lights coming out of the bottom of it or something like that and uh you
(3:18:07) know I don't have an explanation for it but I don't believe we have aliens here either I don't believe we have aliens
(3:18:13) here either so what do you what do you say about that if I may ask what your was
(3:18:18) it 97 maybe 98 okay so before like commercial you
(3:18:25) drones and stuff like that that's for sure if you are close to a bombing range and we do see spikes of these things mil
(3:18:32) there's nothing like that no like you said the us will go up there and use it Parts as a bombing range right
(3:18:40) no a normal plane it wasn't a normal plane no I'm not saying it's a plane so
(3:18:47) so I was saying that like we tend to see these things happen a lot around like military bases or military activity and
(3:18:54) it's hard to know what they're doing uh they go through a lot of prototypes that we actually don't see um a lot of it we
(3:19:01) do just to be clear very few prototypes exist that we don't see but in bulk over
(3:19:06) all the prototypes they've made there are still quite a few and you know that's still like the best
(3:19:12) explanation rather than humans are so important that aliens are trying to visit us I here's my theory right like
(3:19:18) if aliens were to go across the universe they would have like this massively
(3:19:23) efficient but still power hungry propulsion system because we Pro like it still probably seems to be the case that
(3:19:30) you can't time travel and stuff if they figure it out that then everything I say does technically fall apart but assuming
(3:19:36) that they need all this energy to get here in the first place what's the first thing they're thinking of who has more energy for us and that's where they go
(3:19:42) first um no but you're switching it I'm just I was giving the aliens thing an example for because you guys are saying
(3:19:48) there's no such thing as vampires so you you kind of just almost proved my point is that if they can have
(3:19:55) things that even the military doesn't know about like the pill that they talked about on Rogan the milary knows
(3:20:02) about it no that they no no no that they testified in front of the government it was either senate or congress saying
(3:20:09) these things exist and we have no idea top level generals things like that and then the actual government
(3:20:15) Representatives that have the legal right to oversight for these things can't get on to the bases and stuff they
(3:20:22) just deny them access even though they have every legal access and the only way to get in there would be to go in armed
(3:20:28) and take it and they can't do that so if they're willing to go that fire what are they protecting state secret they're not
(3:20:36) just protecting experimental aircraft dude they're they're they're protecting like real evil stuff I mean if you look
(3:20:42) at how value it is valuable it is to have blueprints of an enemy's prototype before especially if it's an effective
(3:20:48) one before it gets into the battlefield it what you're saying no what you're saying is not addressing what I'm saying
(3:20:54) if top the fourstar generals can't are tell are coming to
(3:20:59) the government saying we don't even know what's going on right and then the government go to check it out and that
(3:21:05) no one's allowed to see it then how can it be good that's Shifty but I don't
(3:21:10) know if it helps you feel better there are like subcommittees that they make instead of like your normal citizen groups yes I want all of it you're not
(3:21:18) you you're pretending that you have an answer without having an answer teally you're pretending to have an answer
(3:21:24) without without what they would say there's technically I don't even understand the question yet I just hold
(3:21:30) on a second trippy are you um setting up your stream yeah yeah that's why I've been so quiet sorry okay yeah no worries
(3:21:37) just get that set up and then um we'll probably shut down here maybe like maybe
(3:21:42) another 20 minutes and then I'll just redirect them right over to you oh thank you are you gonna be set up by then yeah
(3:21:48) definitely I'm almost done I'm just uh setting up tags and perfect doing all the
(3:21:54) crap like these two were talking and I'm thinking the whole time I'm like ancient saman tablets would say that you know
(3:22:00) aliens came down changed our DNA and they made us mine for gold so they could save their own atmosphere sounds like a
(3:22:07) better conversation yeah yeah right dude and we could talk about Yak if you guys want he invented white people and on the
(3:22:14) island of paos yes yeah dude he BW up that big ass Rock and he made the Earth and the moon and then he stuck a bunch
(3:22:20) of people in caves and he was like when I'm dead you get these people out of there they'll be white this is great
(3:22:25) [ __ ] yes because of their skin color and now demons I try talking about climate change this guy complains and then I
(3:22:32) talk about aliens you can't
(3:22:37) win alien Joe your laugh is too much see I often wonder if you're pretending to
(3:22:43) not understand what he's saying or me not yeah like when you say that like
(3:22:50) do you not understand that that was a joke exactly what he just said is a same thing that that other fell said earlier
(3:22:56) is that you go into these to the minutia of things without actually addressing
(3:23:01) the topic oh what NE said no I'm trying to address what you said I I don't like
(3:23:07) Sarah do you think I was doing that if you're there like when when you were talking about trippy was saying like was
(3:23:14) giving you crap for talking about no with 10th Man when when we were Happ in the back and he was trying to tell me
(3:23:20) about the aliens and I was trying to like like I realize I go no one's saying it's aliens see what I mean like you're
(3:23:27) not even addressing what we're talking about so started talk to uh Phoenix so can you
(3:23:34) give me a short condensed version T yeah we started to one of the guys said what do you think about Diddy I mentioned the
(3:23:39) tunnels and that you didn't believe me when I told you about it six months ago that this was going on and then it got
(3:23:45) into aliens no yeah and I was trying to explain that like obviously there's something real
(3:23:52) dark going on with the government and the elites that they don't want us to know I doubt he disagree with that
(3:23:58) continue okay do you remember what can I can can you just show that you actually listen to what I said like why the
(3:24:04) government is so shady in the first place they say yours because they're evil and
(3:24:10) controlled by the mafia okay so I don't think you listen because I I just tried to point out right like they cover up a
(3:24:15) lot of this stuff because they're like there's will be like Russian spies and stuff who legitimately want blueprints for prototypes and stuff because that
(3:24:22) can be a game Cher on the battlefield no one would disagree with that the Enigma uh once we found out what that was we
(3:24:28) were able to get in there and tear up all their subs and intercept their [ __ ] and keep it quiet once we got the blueprints no one can argue with what
(3:24:35) he's saying so I just to me there always does seem to be at least a more reasonable
(3:24:41) explanation um whether or not we should take that with a grain of salt like I agree with we should that it is pretty
(3:24:47) shady and when it comes to like war crimes that they're doing around the world like what can they cover up with
(3:24:53) that so but I think you know maybe we're concerned about different things well I didn't hear aliens in your stuff at all
(3:24:59) yet I I know well just because I don't think there are aliens oh I think that's where you you guys disagree and tenth
(3:25:05) was trying to say that they probably do cover up aliens and you are saying they are better no I don't think they're are
(3:25:11) aliens I think that's all a distraction because what what Roseanne
(3:25:18) said is true is that they're vampires and they literally are vampires like I
(3:25:24) don't mean like Buffy the vamp vampire not not Buffy the Vampire Slayer right or Salem's
(3:25:30) lck but you know I'm smoking a lot the rich people do weird fads and there's often no like
(3:25:37) real basis in health for it but like if they think that they're just doing like a blood transfusion the same as like
(3:25:42) getting a blood no there is a basis in health it's a well-known thing that Young Blood injected into you right
(3:25:50) that's that's what Lance Armstrong got in trouble for was blood doping I think it was oxygenated blood not young
(3:25:57) people's blood yeah no he was taking his blood Before the Race and then giving it
(3:26:04) back to himself before the race so that he had extra blood in his system it's
(3:26:09) called blood doping yeah I think it was putting oxy taking it out putting oxygen into it and sticking it back in and it
(3:26:15) has nothing do with young people anyway which is what you were just talking about I'm going beyond that I'm saying
(3:26:21) that they that's where the tens of thousands of children are going missing every year is I think that they're just
(3:26:28) sucking them dry I dig it adrenochrome I dig it adren is definitely not useful
(3:26:34) for anything well that would explain why uh Tom Brady is actually going Benjamin Button himself back to being more
(3:26:41) youthful right right right it didn't work it didn't work for m at all she she
(3:26:50) look I mean like if I could sell the rich from snake oil like I'm not big on the rich I don't
(3:26:56) mind but I would sell Eskimo ice yeah I I don't know that they have
(3:27:02) any Fountain of Youth because I look at these old [ __ ] who everybody talking about taking this AOC Chrome they look
(3:27:07) like they about to die tomorrow so I don't see how it's working either you know you know what the trick is don't
(3:27:14) sorry I'll let you go trippy no I was just say don't forget about OIC too and OIC face you know yeah but like let me
(3:27:21) just uh allow me to voice confirm imperious is that you yeah you know the [ __ ] this
(3:27:27) is well you're not g to talk to me like that but I got to make sure it's not somebody else be
(3:27:34) you there there is no one other than me yes it's me he's coming in here horny tonight oh good evening good evening
(3:27:42) evening some of you I've had the pleasure of
(3:27:47) meeting before some of you I haven't uh to anyone who I haven't [ __ ] you all I don't care about you um now the whole
(3:27:56) thing was nonsense like I I don't understand the the entire focus of the debate they're
(3:28:03) both cucks just in different ways uh well we're far beyond that
(3:28:09) conversation yeah what debate and all that I can see some hit that little on
(3:28:14) the left side of the video there's a thing that says live and then you click yeah yeah that's what I'm doing yeah I
(3:28:20) you know the thing is don't put an advertisement that that says that's this topic of the show then and then redirect
(3:28:26) it afterward oh hold the [ __ ] up hold up hold up number one we had the debate I
(3:28:31) hosted it tonight we had the whole thing it was done really really fast I think
(3:28:37) they were in and out in 30 minutes and so we made the executive decision to
(3:28:42) yeah because they're both would you shut the [ __ ] up and listen what is my number one rule for this panel could s Sarah
(3:28:48) I've talked to you before I don't give a [ __ ] about your rules all right well listen let's do this so I can get some quiet time um they had the debate and so
(3:28:56) we decided to go into open Panel and have a discussion we've been all over the place on topics I don't feel the
(3:29:03) need to go backwards on topics but if we can you know like it's called being a
(3:29:09) good panelist a good panelist comes on and stays on topic or knows the direction of what happened and so on and
(3:29:15) so forth and this is the direction
(3:29:21) so yes so so you're talking about nonsense in other words we are the the
(3:29:27) panel is having the conversation that they choose to have it's their panel
(3:29:32) they're this like a panel of glory holes what are you talking about that's okay I'm okay with this my hes absolutely is
(3:29:39) this guy like some kind of is this guy some kind of edge Lord is he is he trying toet cool guy see this is why I don't
(3:29:47) make mind when people criticize me because I'll never be as bad as imp people like imperi so yeah probably not
(3:29:52) yeah I'm the angel of death on YouTube and like I said I ended Andrew's career a couple days
(3:29:58) ago all Undead idiot had to do was use the use the structure that I put out on
(3:30:05) Joe Moy and you could have crushed Andrew on Steam it's very easy I would have done it myself Andre homo Andrew's
(3:30:12) homo stop it stop it now I made a Rule and I know not everybody was here but I
(3:30:18) made a rule at the very beginning when I just decided to open the panel up after the debate which I normally wouldn't do
(3:30:24) I said we're not going to come on here and just trash talk either of the panelists that's not the point we can
(3:30:30) come on and have the actual discussion of the topic but we're not going to just come on and Trash Talk anybody so
(3:30:36) imperious I'm kicking you out for the rest of the night you go find somewhere else where you can complain about people and do your own little thing over there
(3:30:43) but I I already laid this rule down at the very beginning I'm not sure if everybody was here but that's poor poor
(3:30:50) panelist manners you don't just show up a being off topic
(3:30:56) B downt talking the host and C going against the rules that she already put
(3:31:01) out there earlier if you were actually [ __ ] watching yeah you don't just get to tune in and be like Oh I'm GNA add
(3:31:07) something stupid to this yeah we're not gonna play that game kind of that was
(3:31:13) his intent I was about to say that is totally what he hopped up here to be edgy and and entertain and I ain't that
(3:31:20) like Diva [ __ ] well Joe I don't know about you but I was super impressed I I would
(3:31:25) really want to sub to that Spur's freaking Channel right now oh yeah please put his CH link up there I was
(3:31:32) trying to say you know that was his first [ __ ] mistake is thinking that people know who the hell you are you can't say oh this guy should have
(3:31:38) followed my rule set for this never watched you I think his channel is
(3:31:43) meatspin.com something like that oh yeah I think you're right or uh you just Google blue waffle just Google I think
(3:31:50) he's mad because of the same reason I am because we're not talking about why this panel host is so
(3:31:56) pretty we do that often I was about to say thank you but I'm not the
(3:32:04) host no sing noing allow you yeah I just I just
(3:32:11) I really have like no patience for people coming on to my my panel right
(3:32:18) and and acting like there's something special and they could just come onto my panel and just spit [ __ ] all over the
(3:32:24) place now Resto and I'll just leave not you K man Resto and GD
(3:32:31) obviously had some beef and you know like they had to get it out whatever we
(3:32:36) worked through it but everybody ended up being respectful to me when I said shut the [ __ ] up but come on tell me what the
(3:32:43) [ __ ] I'm gonna talk about on my show and then tell me to shut up and then interrupt me and all like I'm just not
(3:32:50) going to do it I don't I don't care like what do I have to lose a show okay darn
(3:32:56) I don't think anybody's gonna be like H I'm unsubscribing to Sarah because she yelled that in Paris listen I don't know
(3:33:04) any of you guys I don't know you guys but the person that has the fox icon not
(3:33:09) my favorite person in the world but I love them now after meeting that guy yeah there you go am i twoo s thought
(3:33:16) you did a perfect timing uh you spoke up immediately when he said you you hand it
(3:33:22) well and I like to let people do what they on experience their own [ __ ] without my input but since you're asking
(3:33:29) in korder yeah I thought you hand it perfectly you jumped in just interrupted him at the hold on hold on wait a minute
(3:33:37) perfect timing I thought oh well thank you I just don't
(3:33:43) put I just don't have the tolerance level anymore like I used to tolerate a lot more you know I
(3:33:50) was always afraid I would you know hurt not necessarily hurt somebody's feelings but I would lose viewers [ __ ] like
(3:33:57) I was I was afraid of what I would do or being a [ __ ] and they they ter you know
(3:34:02) coin me as like oh she's a feminist they [ __ ] call me one anyways you know she
(3:34:08) yelled at somebody okay so the [ __ ] what you all are a bunch of whiny little
(3:34:14) [ __ ] on the internet wash your vagina sir like that's all you guys did well
(3:34:21) not you would see understood you right but that's all you guys do is you go around you run from panel to panel
(3:34:26) bitching and complaining about other people they said this they said that w w
(3:34:32) I don't [ __ ] care endlessly endlessly [ __ ] care you know how much [ __ ]
(3:34:39) people talk about me you know how many chats I have to sit there and watch while I'm on somebody's somebody else's
(3:34:44) panel talking and I'm I'm not crying and I'm the [ __ ] girl in this aspect and
(3:34:50) you guys are a bunch of grown ass [ __ ] men mad that another man talked
(3:34:55) about you or mad that another man went and hung out with this other guy and they said they wouldn't or you guys were
(3:35:02) in that person's chat while I was live how [ __ ] it why it [ __ ] all the
(3:35:07) way home and that's how domestic abuse happens because imagine how angry they
(3:35:12) would get oh it's imagine how angry those people would if they knew the people closest to them thought way worse
(3:35:18) of them than that right you do realize he won right cuz now for the last 10 minutes we're talking no I'm going off
(3:35:25) about all of yes he's moved it I think in a good direction I'm not even talking about him like I'm talking about a
(3:35:31) general like abstract concept of like how YouTubers interact and then they
(3:35:37) actually act like people [ __ ] care like we [ __ ] care about your feelings we care that you're a little [ __ ] we
(3:35:43) care that you're whining nobody [ __ ] cares all we're doing is laughing at you being a little goddamn [ __ ] on a
(3:35:51) screen thousands of people I think I found myself on the whatever show B take
(3:35:57) hold on let me check and see where the [ __ ] I'm just so tired of it like the
(3:36:02) you know I mean the the Resto and grid like this is not the first time we've seen this [ __ ] and that's why I'm like
(3:36:09) are we sure we want to talk about this you know we can't just pretend the other one doesn't exist like why do you give
(3:36:16) each other that much credibility why do you validate it why do you validate any of it you validate it by acknowledging
(3:36:23) it guess what you're all [ __ ] dead to me what do the stri S effect the uh you
(3:36:28) know the more you're trying to kill it you know the more you're blowing it up and making yourself uh you make it look
(3:36:35) bigger yeah nobody would even know nobody would even [ __ ] know yeah to sit there for five minutes expl
(3:36:43) [ __ ] my last name is specific name and go on but don't you talk about me
(3:36:49) because you're putting me in danger but I'm going to talk about it and allude to it in very specific man like I didn't
(3:36:55) even know who this person was and then all of a sudden I'm like well what's the name and then maybe you're looking in
(3:37:01) chat for it it just on and on and on and on you you feed the Bears they're going
(3:37:06) to keep coming back yeah years ago I was in a in a random Youtube chat right this
(3:37:12) this guy uh I don't think he streams anymore E Juice and um somebody in his chat they put my full
(3:37:18) first middle last my full address my state everything only thing they didn't
(3:37:23) have in there was like my ZIP code and my uh or my area code and my phone number and uh I just went to the host I
(3:37:29) was like yo could you uh can you wrench me right quick thanks bud I let him know what was going on he's like yeah that
(3:37:36) dude's been picking people in the chat and just putting their address and [ __ ] in there I used to get
(3:37:42) that yeah dude anytime you're doxed on YouTube just don't make a deal out of it kind of move on with your day and you
(3:37:47) broke everything that they've got for you like just just go ahead they want they want the
(3:37:53) reaction yeah I told you 100% 100% I can't say nothing because I agree with
(3:37:58) you I can't say when you take when you take like remove the emotions okay
(3:38:03) remove your [ __ ] emotions from the conversation and you'll realize you don't give a [ __ ] about any of it an
(3:38:10) Arbiter coming in with the $ two doll come across a random man or random furry
(3:38:15) thank you Arbiter we appreciate it really does suck though for some people like uh like I used to talk to Aiden
(3:38:21) Paladin a lot I don't know if you guys know Aiden but she got in some serious [ __ ] because she was talking about like
(3:38:28) uh okay that thing that happened with that guy that was an artist in Germany you know a failed artist you know what
(3:38:34) I'm you know what I'm saying and she said she was like the number of people who supposedly died wasn't as high as we
(3:38:40) say and uh they reported her to the college that she worked for and got her like fired
(3:38:46) like a student assistant and she had like this Grant and stuff and they got that taken away and it was like her what
(3:38:53) do you what do you think about that well uh well assuming all the other personal [ __ ] she is saying something we we'll
(3:38:59) move it a little bit the Holocaust not that many of them died what do you think
(3:39:04) I thought I was I didn't say the J word I used I could do better that's why I
(3:39:10) didn't either but that's the topic that she was talking about she got [ __ ] for it people reported her to the school got
(3:39:16) her fired and basically ruined her life and then they put out a real name to everybody and it's like well you want to
(3:39:23) ruin somebody's life oh man so that's exactly what happened and you think what about she's back on YouTube again so
(3:39:29) she's all right at least what do you come down what do you come down on it trippy what do you come down on it that it was extreme on uh acting like that to
(3:39:37) get somebody screwed over of course yeah like see the only time that um I kind of
(3:39:43) feel like the only time that internet drama should leave internet like maybe involve somebody's real life as if
(3:39:48) they're doing something insanely legal like if you got proof they're a murderer or that uh keyword you know yeah like
(3:39:55) then yeah okay report their ass get them notified or get the cops notified whatever but don't take it into your
(3:40:01) YouTube ass hands yeah usually you ain't got a YouTube something if it's illegal like that you can take to the cops right
(3:40:08) yeah just take it to the cops quietly you don't have to make YouTube streams about it you don't have to act like you're the the hunter yeah and though
(3:40:15) hero the hero I think people sit at home and they feel better if they could talk about other people's shortcoming somehow
(3:40:21) they feel like I'm better than this guy this guy and that's a full day for them and that's
(3:40:27) insane I can be your hero baby like I got I got red doxed while I
(3:40:33) was in a coma like tell me that was fun I did how do that happen
(3:40:40) well crazy yeah for three days it was a lot of things that don't belong on
(3:40:46) YouTube and two of them are docine and personal family members you know uh yeah
(3:40:53) you know like kids spouses who aren't online as well and things like that now
(3:40:59) you know and I kind of touched on this tonight at the very beginning I said you know uh when I was saying like personal
(3:41:05) family members are aim it's completely I.E the children um but I did say Rachel
(3:41:10) would be on the table still since she is a public figure she does put her name out there like she is still on the table
(3:41:16) as far as I'm concerned um because she's not an innocent party if she had no online presence whatsoever maybe she was
(3:41:23) just in the chat or something like that totally different ball game I think she would be off limits but like stay out of
(3:41:29) you know like it's just it's just a it's the Rules of Engagement for YouTube no
(3:41:35) docine and leave the [ __ ] family alone yeah it's like the unwritten rule we need like a tablet we can we can no
(3:41:41) no you can't it's the mo Sarah was talking about though these rules will never work cuz when a [ __ ] get
(3:41:47) emotional they they go outside lose logic and you can't talk to them again until they come back yeah uh so the
(3:41:55) rules escalate because they're emotionally like too bothered by it that
(3:42:00) they can't come down like they can't reason right you know while they're in that state yeah and I like I've been
(3:42:06) bothered as [ __ ] by stuff that people have done to be on the internet I don't make a big deal out of it the rules you
(3:42:12) know it's not logical the more you talk about it the more you blow it up you know you're smart
(3:42:19) but thank you is it because of what the other
(3:42:24) person said earlier is because they're horny and they don't think right I'm I'm rolling with that I'm rolling with that
(3:42:30) idea he was just horny and couldn't think right or his underwear was too tight maybe I don't even know who was in
(3:42:37) the debate earlier who was in the debate and what was the debate about no
(3:42:42) we're just talking about in general people that come up here and spur out like that and they're all Angry is it because they're too horny and they just
(3:42:48) can't control themselves yeah it's like go drop by one of those websites we all know about if you're getting if you're
(3:42:55) getting laid regularly it's pretty hard to be up here criticizing other people and putting people down as your life
(3:43:01) missing yeah only that if you're touching grass like we had this
(3:43:06) conversation the other night on my panel we talked about uh have you know walking
(3:43:11) away from if you're a content creator having the ability to walk away take breaks you know regular breaks touch
(3:43:17) grass stone and so forth and I think when people get too sucked in it just now this becomes your reality my
(3:43:24) perception is my reality right it's not healthy at all so then your life Evol like me I put I I close the screen turn
(3:43:32) the camera off I go upstairs and I'm done now I'm still involved with uh putting stuff together and there are a
(3:43:38) few shows that I go and I I watch or jump on panel every now and then but outside of that like I'm out
(3:43:45) you know I don't live here I I don't even have notifications turned on because I don't give a [ __ ] that's
(3:43:51) that's the only healthy way I I [ __ ] I see you guys and I won't even remember this [ __ ] because as soon as I walk out
(3:43:58) and go do something else I'm going with somebody helping my buddy do this fixing the gate or we gotta run do this [ __ ] I
(3:44:05) get I got other [ __ ] I don't have to be preoccupied I for that this panel existed until I saw it show I clicked on
(3:44:11) my subscriptions and I must have subscribed when I was on here before forgot any of this even existed I
(3:44:17) probably told you about it no yeah you did a long long time ago and then I came
(3:44:22) up here and then until I saw her pretty face and then I was like oh that was that panel I was on a long time ago and
(3:44:29) then I told him you were smart Sarah he forgot if I told him you were pretty he'd have been here a long [ __ ] time
(3:44:36) ago that's fair uh trippy you want to go get started and then I'll over here I'll
(3:44:41) let everybody pretty people hold on you want to do any final thoughts to you
(3:44:48) trippy final thoughts uh the internet is for uh no I can't say that you guys know
(3:44:55) that song avue Q look it up um you saying yes you know the song look
(3:45:01) like you a not of it I know the song It's a gamer it's kind of a gamer

(3:45:14) like yep yeah a friend of mine out out in Australia actually got to sing that song on stage with AV Q at some point um
(3:45:23) wow but yeah it was a fun panel I didn't get to see the debate because I was way way too late but um you know I came in
(3:45:30) here talked about aliens samans it good so my my statement would be this
(3:45:37) hold on he saying his goodbyes yeah yeah I'm gonna go live over at my channel I'm gonna try to figure out who's next after
(3:45:43) p didy and uh you know I hope it's not me I hope it's not a YouTuber it's JayZ it's Jay-Z like
(3:45:51) what if it's PewDiePie no yeah yeah he'd be hiding some [ __ ] you're like this is
(3:45:57) how I got my wife pregnant and there's videos everywhere and you're like oh my God I didn't want to see that put that away you know uh but yeah I'm gonna get
(3:46:04) out of here y'all have a good rest of the stream all right Tri uh yeah yeah
(3:46:10) thanks for having me absolutely we we'll all be over there I'll remove you I'll
(3:46:15) remove you oh I got it yeah trippy's going to get started here in just a few minutes and and I'll
(3:46:22) uh send everybody over you guys can go play over there about his his topic
(3:46:27) tonight is did he do it yes nice little don't forget your oil
(3:46:34) hope you remember your thoughts yes yeah no so so in regards to um thank you Joe
(3:46:41) uh in regards to um content creators and it I'm more
(3:46:47) interested in trying to build something even if I disagree with the person I try to build a rapport with them if
(3:46:53) possible you are the worst at building rapport with any no he's at building he might not be
(3:47:00) great at keeping him or something but he is excellent at uh greeting and building reports with everybody better than most
(3:47:07) I I think in all fairness um I when I start to realize that I'm just dealing with a [ __ ] ret a effing yeah rir
(3:47:15) then I just I disengage from them uh I have no problem burning that bridge I
(3:47:21) assume that through the gate is much more better for you it's healthier I just assume through the gate and if I
(3:47:26) get some more pleasant I'm thrilled but you know I'm not disappointed ever yeah
(3:47:32) so so for me in my situation is that there's some people that want to build and there's some people that just want
(3:47:37) to destroy and doesn't matter how much you try to stack up blocks there's always
(3:47:43) some rat kid that want wants to come and smack him down and then that kid kid
(3:47:48) usually gets punched in the face in kindergarten and he'll get punched in the face as an adult we all like to see
(3:47:53) the bully get his dude I think we all on board with that part and then Li and said that you started it yeah I know I
(3:47:59) know well yeah there's there's that they call them cry bullies um but anyway both them [ __ ] gay if they talk about who
(3:48:06) hit who first I don't want to hear it I don't I don't have no patience for it I'm with Sarah you're both women stop it
(3:48:13) he hit me first he call me a name first yeah I got no patience for that [ __ ] you
(3:48:19) know my rule Joe if you come within arms length your life is forfeit is your
(3:48:28) rule T is uh famous for I will go after your uh grandchildren's grandchildren's
(3:48:34) grandchildren this is you guys don't know that phrase with this is the guy which is great he is raage like no other
(3:48:43) all I have to say to sign off is us pretty people are the real minorities and we have to stick
(3:48:51) together you know what so funny is I went out Friday night and and I was with a friend and I looked around and I told
(3:48:57) him I was like is it just me or are there like a bunch of ugly people in here tonight just saying we're the
(3:49:03) minority they're going to come for us eventually they're going to come for us I swear it was like ugly it was ugly
(3:49:09) people night at the bar you remember the Twilight Zone episode you remember the Twilight Zone episode where they're all
(3:49:15) I want to go to the Ugly bar I want to go there now I'm telling you they were ugly as [ __ ] but do you remember do you
(3:49:21) ever see the Twilight Twilight Zone episode where there was a really pretty lady and she had to get plastic surgery
(3:49:27) cuz they all looked like pigs and so they had to make her look like a pig that's what US pretty people are looking
(3:49:33) looking into in the future they're going to come for us and make us ugly so that they don't feel bad about themselves
(3:49:39) that's now what they do with normalizing all of this bad behavior it's what they
(3:49:44) did bad about
(3:49:51) themselves that was a cold transition nobody caught that they normalize ugly
(3:49:56) so they feel better about themselves that's you know they tell you it's okay to sleep with who you want that way they
(3:50:02) would feel better whever they are yeah the ugly
(3:50:07) people yeah those cats yes I don't know it's I just think that they travel in
(3:50:15) packs I gotta go to that bar now I got to it's worth it to me well you know I normally wouldn't go
(3:50:23) there on a Friday night but um it was kind of like on a whim and so we went in
(3:50:29) there and like Saturday nights it's usually like nothing but sexy hot people
(3:50:36) but I guess Friday night is like freshman squad or something but it was it was not pretty like anybody else ever
(3:50:43) experienced that I'm even trying Brak that's the way itur anything all the ugly people just
(3:50:51) got paid they all just got paid so they come there and they try to spend money to get somewhat not as ugly people to
(3:50:59) sleep with them and then they're all poor by Saturday and then that's when the good-looking people go
(3:51:04) out I was wonder why Friday was in that's possible that's possible um Angry

(3:51:38) cck oh yes stepdads are cuckle whether or not uh Andrew Wilson was a cuck or not oh that would have been no one seems
(3:51:46) to like that dude man I'm assuming that that he would have lost tremendously no one seems to like [ __ ] Andrew on any
(3:51:52) these it was pretty wild dude I when I saw it that you were live and it was Andrew and Undead chronic I was like
(3:51:58) damn this should be good that's what I thought I was I was expecting you know at least one of them to Spur out some
(3:52:05) blood right oh they did oh they did they
(3:52:11) SP no dude it oh yes dude it was more rekindled a bromance we we ended up
(3:52:17) having the spur session later with other people so right we got what we paid
(3:52:24) for nobody nobody asked for a refund after that not really nothing to even review
(3:52:31) over that it was nothing it was like they came on they had a conversation like all right and that's why I was like
(3:52:37) you guys have a beer or something like oh Lord Simon same to you we're get
(3:52:45) down I'm not getting I'm not getting into any more arguments tonight I that D
(3:52:51) that dude's laugh is crazy

(3:53:34) crazy laugh myself I got crazy up here tonight too is that the first time he's been up here uh I think he's been up
(3:53:41) here before and you let him back up twice song well he it didn't it was very
(3:53:47) shortlived if you hadn't seen that's holiday music I I slowly po uh do you go
(3:53:54) to the Bears on Saturday or Friday he T like me I got to see the ugly people
(3:54:01) Jesus that's like I felt like I went into like a strip club on a Tuesday afternoon you know it's like where's
(3:54:08) where's the Varsity Squad at like oh you just mentioned scrip club I'm going to tell you tell you tell you a story real
(3:54:13) quick one time I did I'd never been to the strip club I'd only been to strip clubs in like Northern
(3:54:20) Canada and uh went with a dude I used to know from when I was younger we went to
(3:54:25) the strip club it's no longer there but we left about probably h a beer and a
(3:54:32) half into it because um the the the ladies didn't have any
(3:54:38) teeth like I mean a couple love ladies it was weird mov me from this uh chat um
(3:54:46) this this talking about like ladies with no teeth in the strip club you ain't never you ain't never had you ain't
(3:54:52) never been gummed on before we we don't give him a whole lot
(3:54:57) of thought process don't worry about him talking wait if you're American uh are
(3:55:03) you American who whoever was talking about the stripper
(3:55:08) story no not Canadian but I'm close yeah I was going to sayadian
(3:55:14) Peak [ __ ] like I only go to strip clubs in Northern Canada strip clubs in America are pretty
(3:55:21) awesome yes just got to find the right one man this is true you could if you
(3:55:26) see stretch marks and C-section marks and [ __ ] there probably go different [ __ ] yeah I've been to some where they
(3:55:32) had pregnant women up there on [ __ ] pregnant women right bullet holes yes I've been
(3:55:39) there they got to feed their kids so I just wonder how they give lap dances do
(3:55:45) they does the guy have to pay double since it's technically two people
(3:55:53) oh that's a good question oh wow Simon wants up back again
(3:56:00) no no he like I he's lucky I even
(3:56:06) acknowledge his existence on this show who's that a lot of people
(3:56:11) feel yeah he he just like always wants
(3:56:16) he wants everybody's attention on every single panel so he starts
(3:56:21) [ __ ] that has nothing to do with any of what anybody he just starts talking [ __ ]
(3:56:27) like you did you are you are you referring to me and everyone's like we're not right right the a normal a
(3:56:33) regular conversation or conversation that's not about him is not even allowed to continue as long as he is up here
(3:56:39) he's going to pull it back to someone offending me or or someone's a piece of [ __ ] yeah yeah and it's like nobody even
(3:56:46) understands where he comes like like how did you even like get like how English that's
(3:56:55) all you need to know yeah he's very self-centered self-absorbed selfish conceed I think he lives right on the
(3:57:02) like on the border of England and wherever the the the [ __ ] French live in France and hard cuz dude the only
(3:57:10) other people that are that arrogant are the French and the [ __ ] polish yeah yeah but even at that I just like I'll
(3:57:18) let him come on the panel because I know he's going to be booted very quickly so it's be short live yeah like I don't
(3:57:25) even allow like it there's no warning it's just up bye just like Carrie Carrie
(3:57:32) gets the same treatment because I have very low tolerance for Carrie as well you know he comes on and he starts spur
(3:57:38) and he talks about [ __ ] [ __ ] and then you're like shut up Carrie like you're ruining the conversation and then just
(3:57:44) just boot them just boot just say bye and they come back they still come back they're not even they that personality
(3:57:51) that comes up here and must be the center of attention at all times of course they must come back they need
(3:57:58) that fix even if it a big those they need some yeah yeah exactly I don't know
(3:58:03) about but it really bothers me when I have to kick someone off the panel because I don't like doing the [ __ ] I have no issue not anymore at least like
(3:58:10) I don't even give a [ __ ] now people pay me to kick them off and I'm like yep okay no problem well when when you're getting paid that's a different story
(3:58:17) you know that's part of the you know the contractual agreement that we have with each other but when someone you know
(3:58:25) pisses me off to the point to where I I choose that I have to drop them that that bothers me because I really like to
(3:58:31) uh have a platform where people can speak freely s I'm G make your life a little easier I'm about to cut out uh my
(3:58:38) final thoughts uh my final thoughts I hate that I uh miss the debates and I wish I
(3:58:45) would have seen more of 10th and Eve and they got their opportunity I predict one day it's something spectacular will
(3:58:51) happen between those two I'm telling you bro all right later later Joe bye
(3:58:57) Joe um yeah I think it's more along the lines of
(3:59:03) uh of basically like I I you know people that I have respect
(3:59:10) for people that can come on and have a conversation yeah no I'm not just going to boot them you know just because I'm
(3:59:16) mad at them or something that's not my game and I don't get mad at I just don't give a [ __ ] um but I think like for
(3:59:22) people who come on and are like a waste of space in terms of the conversation or
(3:59:29) like destroying a panel seat you know that we could have had somebody else especially when you have a you know like
(3:59:36) a backstage that's full and waiting to get on here and then somebody comes on and they're just wasting a spot over
(3:59:42) stuff that has nothing to do with the topic I have no issue it's like bye bye I just don't care you know the plenty of
(3:59:49) people want to get on the show plenty of people want to come up and have something to say so I don't I like if
(3:59:54) you're G to be on here and just be stupid then we leave it you know it is what it is yeah some people are only
(4:00:01) good at taking up space it seems yeah exactly but well I'm G get off here I'll
(4:00:07) talk to you later Sarah yeah any final Thoughts From You Snowman no no other than I just found
(4:00:12) out tonight that we're all cucks we're all cucks so
(4:00:18) everybody uh May May the I don't even know D dude just enjoy being cucked I
(4:00:24) guess we all got cucked I think dude I think Undead chronic and Andrew planned to cuck us
(4:00:32) all didn't it feel that way I was like that like I feel like I feel like we
(4:00:38) were uh we we it was false advertising on that debate mhm well and like I'm
(4:00:46) thankful I had the clips of them kind of talking [ __ ] about it you know cuz if not I would have been like why like
(4:00:51) people would have been like why the hell did you set this up like the trailer at least shows like the
(4:00:57) true they really problem we're all cucks and Andrew and Undead just cucked us all
(4:01:02) they had some fun didn't they yeah they're probably high-fiving right now like switch you know having a beer or
(4:01:08) whatever drinking some cheap Brandy somewhere yeah oh my goodness all right
(4:01:13) easy man yeah we'll see you next round yep bye
(4:01:20) Melanie how are you hi sorry I was muted there for a sec you made it to the end
(4:01:26) oh yeah no I was here for the whole thing I waiting for pronest to finally go live so we can stream together but
(4:01:33) you know people say they'll be live in an hour and it's uh I think they mean something else but you never quite know
(4:01:40) at that point it's like well I'm streaming at some point tonight at least all that's all I know so I've learned
(4:01:46) that content creators some not all but some can be the most
(4:01:52) unreliable unresponsive like just it's so difficult working with
(4:01:59) people who don't like don't have schedules and aren't schedule oriented
(4:02:04) and organized people um I'm probably that way actually so like that oh my
(4:02:11) goodness it's so hard because especially with uh you know obviously getting people to respond to messages if I'm
(4:02:17) setting something up or things like that um it gets it gets difficult sometimes but but
(4:02:23) uh like we we have a naughty list for a reason of people who who show up late or
(4:02:30) like uh you know drop the the um o is it
(4:02:36) public no we should make it public though that would be fun who's on the naughty list the Tomato naughty list but
(4:02:42) yeah I think that that you know we we developed that list because we didn't want to lose track of who's on you know
(4:02:48) we're getting to a point like we have a long list of panelists we go through when we think about putting together a
(4:02:54) debate you know or a show of any sort and you know if like we we didn't want
(4:03:00) to ever lose track or not remember like oh they didn't show up or they kind of called out last minute you know or
(4:03:06) things like that uh we do have forgiveness for certain things you know if they let us know hey such such and
(4:03:12) such this happened whatever whatever you know we're like hey no big deal take care of you you know no no issues there
(4:03:19) but but when they just don't show up or or they just randomly messaged me like
(4:03:25) an hour beforehand hey I can't make it tonight and leave it at that it's like huh like you didn't apologize like
(4:03:32) nothing you know so I I like over over apologize and then people are like oh
(4:03:37) this person is just like annoying or like cares too much I'm okay I'm okay with at least you
(4:03:43) know an apology like hey I'm really sorry I don't want to have to do this but I I absolutely can't make it tonight
(4:03:49) something happened and I have to tend to it but if you just say hey I can't make it tonight as if like it means nothing
(4:03:55) like I have to go find a replacement you know so that's why we try to have like keep a backup on on either side of the
(4:04:02) discussion so that we don't have to find a replacement we already have one a lot of these people have not hosted their
(4:04:08) own panels or had specifically timed events
(4:04:13) you know like mod Monday is very specifically timed to you know for certain reasons um but it's very like
(4:04:22) specific how it operates um and if people can't operate under that function
(4:04:27) then I'm not going to you know I'm not going to panel you now we have open Panel or hot seat we have anybody that's
(4:04:34) on the naughty list can join the hot seat anytime um or open panels but we'll never schedule you and Premiere you you
(4:04:42) know right um so yeah just makes a difference anyway well I think you're doing a good job and it sucks when
(4:04:48) people just make your job harder so yeah that's all I can say to that um to wrap
(4:04:54) up the uh and I'm meing when I say this by the way to wrap up the uh cule Tre debate because we need a bit of levity
(4:05:00) I'm just going to point out if we are looking at the birds and their mating Styles and how the cuck holds do their
(4:05:06) little brood parasym where they get eggs uh from someone else and all that um
(4:05:12) okay yeah let's do it let's start looking at other animals too because if you if you've ever noticed you only need one rooster for all the chickens that
(4:05:20) lay the eggs right so I'm just saying men you better start showing your worth because our us women are going to start
(4:05:26) realizing we only need one of you for a whole lot of us that's a really really good thought I never
(4:05:34) thought of it like that like yeah there could be plenty of us doesn't matter but if there's only
(4:05:41) one of you we can still populate all we need to and we can have the option to
(4:05:46) choose the best one I'm just saying it might be good to go into the kitchen sometimes man might be
(4:05:54) good anyways have a great night thank you so much for letting me onely I have people trying to cancel me
(4:06:01) but I'm sure that like you're reasonable enough to see past the [ __ ] and I appreciate that oh I I don't I mean it
(4:06:08) is what it is people like other people people don't like other people but that's what my platform uh allows is the
(4:06:14) ability to all of the people to come to one screen and still get along as best as they can whether people like you or
(4:06:21) not well I promise at the end of the day I'll try to make your job harder not more difficult although I do like to
(4:06:26) talk a lot so don't get in the way of that just kidding have a good night you
(4:06:32) too Mel we'll see you around a wow what a fun evening it turned out
(4:06:41) completely let's let's slow it down are we ready to
(4:06:47) slow it down and then I'm going to send you guys over to to Trippy cast and you're going to go have some fun over
(4:06:52) there all right so we started with the anticipation that
(4:07:00) this debate was going to get more heated and the the talking points were going to
(4:07:06) be all over the place we thought it was just going to be a I don't know like a
(4:07:11) yelling match of some sort that's that's what a lot of people built that up to be that's what I kind of thought it was
(4:07:17) going to be I was like man this is going to be a hard one how am I going to navigate this properly like how do I ref
(4:07:24) it if they're just both doing this or this or that or whatever what you know it's just kind of like a lot of with
(4:07:29) these two types of personalities they're very big personalities um and it didn't
(4:07:34) happen that way and I'm thankful it didn't happen that way cuz you know sometimes you just kind of hoping and
(4:07:42) praying like please just let this all work out and it did it was the fastest
(4:07:49) debate that I've ever seen I'm I'm willing to say it was the fastest debate on the internet hands
(4:07:55) down they had their points of contention we even went through a whole
(4:08:00) catry uh [Laughter] flowchart I can't believe they actually
(4:08:08) sat and like went through the scaling of of cuckle
(4:08:14) somebody needs to put that into a flowchart I would like a full visualization please this will be great
(4:08:21) but overall I'm glad that they had their moment together they had their time to elaborate and they found so many other
(4:08:28) points that they actually agreed on and that's kind of a even better point to this so ladies and gentlemen let that be
(4:08:35) the example of how two men have a conversation and get through what we
(4:08:41) would consider to be an argument civil it was a great example all right
(4:08:47) you lean in on the things you do agree on and then you can discuss the things you don't agree on
(4:08:54) peacefully but this show is always always having some type of crazy on it so we we were
(4:09:01) not failed nobody gets a refund because grid one and Resto chesto of course went
(4:09:07) Toe to Toe on some drama that nobody actually gives a [ __ ] about um we talked about aliens we
(4:09:15) talked about global warming we talked about I don't know all sorts of stupid
(4:09:23) stuff but it was good I'm glad we had an earlier show this evening so I apologize
(4:09:30) to those who are normally my night owls hanging out cuz this is about the time we'd actually get started but now I can
(4:09:37) actually go take a nice hot bath and I can get to bed on time
(4:09:43) and then we'll see you back here tomorrow night for mod Monday the topic is going to be con about conspiracy
(4:09:50) theories and whether they are doing harm to society or not or are the conspiracy
(4:09:57) theorists causing more issues or or is it just plain fun my
