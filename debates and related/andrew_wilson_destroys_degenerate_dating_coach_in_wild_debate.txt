(3:56) look L preface by saying uh last time the big I'm sure we'll get here this time but it's all in good faith it's all
(4:03) in good fun another day uh you know I respect the fact that you guys are willing to come on and to be in good
(4:08) faith so I appreciate that okay so the topic that we're gonna be debating uh we're talking about this off stage is
(4:14) whether uh you should I'm getting a slight Echo Pedro let me check on
(4:19) that okay just let me know when that st's not going I do not hear it I don't hear anybody else got the echo I don't
(4:27) hear it no I think you're good now gotcha okay so so what we're going to be debating at least we're going to start off with this is whether uh it whether
(4:34) you should have prematal sex right uh whether that's a good idea or bad idea and uh Isen and Andrew are gonna be
(4:40) arguing why you should wait until marriage to have sex me and John are going to argue the opposite of that and also secondly whether pickup Artistry is
(4:48) unethical uh and whether that's something uh that you know is good or bad but we'll start off with the first
(4:54) one so let's start off with opening statements uh I don't mind going first again
(5:00) Pi PR okay cool uh okay so yeah so I I was going through the first debate that
(5:07) we had and I thought was interesting uh I think that where the big disconnect laid was that there were some terms that
(5:14) you were using some uh philosophy terms I didn't truly understand but now that I understand them it helped me really make
(5:20) sense for what was going on and the disconnect we were having so essentially during the first debate you had two
(5:26) arguments for why casual sex is bad one is that it's inconsistent with my values the problem with that is that you may uh
(5:33) massively strowman My Philosophy you as utilitarianism I don't think you do it on purpose but I think that's what
(5:38) happen because at the end of the day I'm not utilitarian I have personal values and uh I think you should live by those
(5:44) personal values and I'm not all about just doing what's not good for the collective so hypothetically speaking if
(5:49) someone was to say yo Alex if you're rap a girl but no one finds out and that rape winds up benefiting the girl would
(5:56) you be forward a utilitarian would argue yes I would say no or for example example if I have a choice between a
(6:01) trolley hitting my girlfriend or killing 20 innocent people I would have the trolley kill uh 20 innocent people so I
(6:08) think what My Philosophy is I want to clarify this I don't think you should do what's best for society but what's best for yourself as long as you're not
(6:14) directly harming others so that de Bon's kind of the first argument that happened during the second one your second
(6:21) argument was religion uh which again not to hope you don't take offense to this but to anyone who's not religious that's
(6:27) not a convincing argument uh so I guess during debate I want to see if you can uh present a solid argument without
(6:33) straw Manning my personal beliefs and not involving Jesus why casual sex is
(6:39) bad all right John you want to take it over from there okay so just to be clear the the two arguments are no Primal sex
(6:46) and what's the second one uh the second why this picker
(6:51) forestry good or bad okay um so regarding the first one
(6:59) um I actually was raised very Catholic so I was planning on waiting till marriage to have sex and once I got to
(7:05) college I realized that everyone was like a different religion and it was only because their parents raised them
(7:12) that way in in 95% of cases and I was arguing hey this is why Catholicism is
(7:17) right and they were saying No this is why this other system is right and what I realized is it was all a charade very
(7:23) quickly and I easily could have been assigned one of those other ones and would be defending an alternative position some people try to reconcile
(7:29) out that by saying that all things you know they're all the part of a bigger system or that's not true because
(7:35) they're threatening and and offering different rewards and punishments and so that kind of like started a lot of my
(7:40) doubting and then I majored in philosophy and cognitive science and psychology and computer science and
(7:47) learned about how the brain works and that got rid of the Soul it got rid of the idea of free will it got rid of the
(7:53) idea of any kind of afterlife or real true purpose and then I discovered n and philosophy and found that My Views very
(8:01) closely match his so I kind of uh shifted my life path fast forward I'm
(8:07) now tattooed this means 500 girls each so I just recently hit 1,500 but I I
(8:15) love my life I I think it's much more satisfying than if I was uh you know put
(8:20) it in my room with a sign that said no girls allowed I already made that joke backstage too uh but you know to your
(8:27) point um also no it's not natural evolutionarily so that's like our only
(8:33) purpose on Earth is to reproduce and monogamy is not natural either that came about with the church in the state
(8:39) there's no uh evidence for monogamy in humans if you study Neuroscience or the
(8:45) anatomy of a human brain or they the I should say the um yeah I mean they found
(8:50) pieces that are related to monogamy we don't have them so um did I cover both of those what was
(8:57) I'm trying to remember what the second one was uh well this is just your opening statement so you yeah talk about
(9:03) whatever you want um yeah so I I mean I was about as religious as a get I was praying daily I was going to church
(9:11) every week I didn't miss a week of church for the first 18 years of my life um so you know I've been on that side
(9:18) pretty hardcore and I I know a ton of I've read the Bible multiple times I've spoken with lots of priests it's
(9:23) probably the area that I devoted the most time to in my life besides learning dating because when I first started
(9:28) doubting it I was so terrified I would go to hell that I had to convince myself in whatever way is possible and so now I
(9:34) have like hundreds of arguments against it but yeah I'll uh diverge from there
(9:40) thank for that all right and we're going to move over to Zen but just before we do that ladies and gentlemen I want to
(9:45) remind you um submit your questions to at The Crucible during the entirety of
(9:51) the debate and I will Feld them at the end then take it over okay so first of
(9:57) all just want to point out a little bit of irony with our friend John Anthony saying that uh it follows from The
(10:03) evolutionary worldview that we should be reproducing but he has supposedly a 1500
(10:09) girl body count and probably far less children um I a respect so okay yeah
(10:15) yeah has 1500 body count of ectomy but believes in evolutionary worldview where we need to be reproducing just just a
(10:21) little irony there we can talk about that in the actual back and forth that we need um but uh to get to stay on
(10:27) topic um we already have our first couple rounds with uh Alex BPF and I did
(10:33) um and we've approached it from as many angles as we possibly can uh to show why
(10:40) even by Alex's own metrics the Casual Sex promiscuous sex Lifestyle the pickup
(10:47) artist The Red Pill doesn't really work for their metric of morality or really any metric of morality maybe John can
(10:55) bring us a new Avenue to approach and show us why it does work um or show us why ours doesn't work in our worldview
(11:02) um but we generally um we're gonna we can approach it from could be won't
(11:08) understand and you haven't yet so there's really no reason to do that it's like going to China and trying to speak
(11:14) English when they're all fluent Chinese speakers you have to speak it in their language so we can explore your guys
(11:20) metrics of morality what is good what is bad typically if there's no starting point no faith-based starting point it's
(11:26) going to have to be outcomes based in order to be coherent um to whatever you're arguing so um we
(11:32) can show you why the promiscuous casual sex lifestyle doesn't work um by by
(11:38) whatever means we need to do we'll go there um but if I if I had to guess I
(11:43) mean we since we've already tried that all I can really gather the fact that it
(11:49) didn't work and since we've already tried it all I can really gather is that what we are dealing with is Two
(11:55) Gentlemen that are exuding the behavior of sex addicts and I'm not necessarily
(12:02) trying to insult you but it's just what I'm observing and when you have an addiction that is blinding your lens
(12:09) where you cannot see anything beyond what you deem to be good for your
(12:15) desires similar to any drug addict would have um it's going to be hard to it's
(12:22) going to be hard to be honest with yourself and see why you could be wrong because you have to give up a lot of the
(12:27) uh the pleasureful desires that are being fulfilled in your current lifestyle um so that's kind of I think
(12:34) the blockade we might be dealing with and maybe why it hasn't been as productive the past couple times um but
(12:40) we're going to try again and we're going to try a new angle or we're gonna we're going to try our best to make this one
(12:46) work so uh I'll with that being said I'll kick it off well one more thing if
(12:51) we if we get to a point where we find that even by your own lights what you
(12:57) guys advocate for the lifestyles that you live are immoral are or are wrong and let's say it's admittedly um what
(13:04) follows from that I think is that there's no valid reason to take someone
(13:09) serious that is admittedly immoral by their own metrics by their own lights so
(13:15) that would be a question that would have to be answered is if you're immoral and you know it and you're acting immoral and you know it why should anybody
(13:22) listen to anything you have to say so that's it all right thank you for that Zen and then we will leave off with
(13:29) Andrew and then after that the floor will be open yeah uh I hope you guys don't mind I always write my opening
(13:35) down um just just so that it's very clear but I did I just just want to respond to a couple things in these
(13:40) other openings really quickly uh because they were regarding a previous debate first uh Alex we didn't say you were a
(13:47) util utilitarian we said you were a consequentialist um utilitarians have a
(13:52) specific framework for consequentialism we just said that you view morality based on consequences because there's
(13:58) just no other way for you to really view it um you you asked if we would make our
(14:03) arguments from some other standpoint besides because Jesus told us so uh but that's a perfectly rational uh uh way to
(14:13) establish your ethical framework so we don't we don't really need to do that but I will just to kind of humor you but
(14:19) but we don't need to it's all I'm saying um so and then also John um I'm glad
(14:26) that you brought up nii as being your favorite philosopher as he died of syphilis so I just I thought that I
(14:34) thought that that was some of the greatest irony I had heard of the night but let me dive into my opening here one
(14:40) if I if I ever get cilis I'll get it cured don't worry yeah well they have antibiotics now but you know not in
(14:46) mei's time uh so first and foremost uh let's dive into pickup Artistry we have
(14:53) several definitions at our disposal uh but we're going to go with the most charitable one for our opponents we Poss
(14:59) possibly can or at least that we have heard thus far the
(15:04) definition uh being that pickup artist teach the skill to men to be imbued with
(15:09) confidence and competence in approaching talking to and eventually dating whatever that preference means whether
(15:15) it means [ __ ] or going to a movie or whatever the I like do you guys are religious and swear that's going to make
(15:20) things better yeah what whatever it is yeah yeah well this is just the opening statement so well let's let's be court
(15:27) and let know swearing not cursing so the cursing means to put a curse on someone
(15:33) but anyway um what whatever that means um what I didn't expect is that we might
(15:40) have to Define woman I was surprised to note that perhaps within this
(15:45) definition uh we didn't we didn't actually need to go into that objective but I think that we do and the
(15:51) classification of a woman for me is simple which is an adult human female I was surprised to learn that Alex's Cod
(15:57) debater uh has had I I think sex with men and claim them to be women I can't
(16:03) imagine a single metric in which that's good for society or for the young men
(16:09) they are supposedly can like a personal cheack Pedro I mean I don't know well it's just for his opening statement he
(16:15) can so so during your opening statement you can lay out any kind of points you want and then you can attack attack that
(16:22) uh when the floor opens I'll make sure though since he is laying out those charges that you guys get the first
(16:27) round of questioning okay I can't imagine a single metric in which that's good for society or for the young men
(16:33) they are supposedly trying to reach with their pickup skills I can't see how this would be good for the family dynamic or
(16:39) the red pill even in general I can't see how this tracks for a societal or even a personal good but it brings us to a much
(16:46) broader point I don't think I don't think either of our opponents can possibly justify pornography for
(16:52) instance within both our worldviews it would necessarily have to be bad from the Alex perspective just using empir
(16:59) ISM in science we can clearly see the damage porn does to society and men in particular it rewires the brain and
(17:05) sexual gratification sensory requiring more and more viewing in order to reach a climax which necessarily requires
(17:12) worse and worse veins pornography to do so the same would also have to be true of sex partners to the tune of hundreds
(17:18) to thousands this would have the same porn likee effect for a man where crazier and weirder sex acts would be
(17:25) required to climax like perhaps eventually having sex with a transgender person when you say you aren't a
(17:31) homosexual as an example not only that but we need to look closely at the fact that these guys talk about game I'm a
(17:38) Hunter Hunters talk about game game is what we hunt our pickup artist friends over here also Hunt game and what they
(17:45) mean by game is what we mean by game the thing they are hunting is women of
(17:52) course this is insane because the point of their Hunt is the trophy at the end
(17:57) and that must necessarily be true from their position as well as ours this means ladies and gentlemen they consider
(18:03) [ __ ] a trophy I'm sure that empowers men everywhere now doesn't it I'm positive women are totally unempowered
(18:10) by the knowledge that simps everywhere view their vaginas as a as a trophy unlike the deer though women do have
(18:16) high cognitive function just like men and use that to their advantage creating even further disempowerment for men I'm
(18:24) sure women everywhere are just as upset as can be knowing men are hunting for their vagina
(18:29) and sexual gratification and will in no way take significant advantage of that at an intuitive and societal level to
(18:36) stack the cards in their [ __ ] favor this entire idea of pickup Artistry is immoral inconsistent and it's [ __ ]
(18:43) stupid to be honest with you it's counterintuitive to its own goals which
(18:48) if we look at my original definition is supposed to be to empower men and that's
(18:54) my opening statement all right and I'm going to open the floor specifically up for
(18:59) um Alex and John because those are a lot of charges laid out John uh you talk first and I want to give you the floor
(19:05) actually so you can actually Lev Levy some questions towards Andrew so I'll let you guys go first go for it unless
(19:11) you want me to go first John it's up to you no I want to okay um so F wait first off are you guys
(19:18) virgins married yeah I'm married as well but you waited till marriage to have sex
(19:24) no no so but that's your position is That's what everyone should do what I
(19:30) mean do you do you think that just because a person makes mistakes uh like let's say I had murdered somebody would
(19:35) it then be improper for me to Advocate that nobody murdered people or recovering heroin addict to say don't do
(19:41) heroin that kind of thing yeah no you're basically just making an extreme point but I mean that's not really relevant
(19:47) what's extreme about it I just want I just want to point out the fact that you guys are defending a position that you're both hypocritical about start
(19:53) well how how could we be hypocritical about it we live the same values right now that we advocate for say that once
(19:59) upon a time uh we did marri yeah but saying saying that because we act longer
(20:05) of no wait I'm sorry because saying that we acted out of turn at some point
(20:10) before we recovered from whatever that thing was and so we Advocate a worldview that's consistent with how we live our
(20:16) lifestyle and our value structure that's not only not inconsistent but you would
(20:21) have to make the case that uh that that somehow if you murdered a person that it
(20:27) would be improper for you to Advocate not to murder people of course it would be proper for you to Advocate not to murder people I'm just saying you're
(20:34) hypocritical that's that's the only thing that's fact well no no no hang on hypocritical I think would imply that
(20:39) you haven't changed your behavior like if we were advocating for a monogamous lifestyle but then it came to fruition
(20:45) that Andrew and I were both engaging in your guys lifestyle like in open relationships and whatnot that would be
(20:51) hypocritical they if I said I real quick if I said like I'm a recovered heroin
(20:56) addict but it turns out I've been doing it behind closed doors like for a long time that would be hypocritical but if you're not doing that behavior anymore
(21:03) that's not hypocritical that's just repenting that's changing Behavior good
(21:08) okay so let's say that that uh you know you were H having my lifestyle bang 1500
(21:14) girls and then you changed last week and got married and you're like it's not hypocritical we changed but you lived
(21:20) your whole life [ __ ] girls so you're calling that like a mistake no well no
(21:26) that's a STW man so if you were to say that you [ __ ] 1500 girls and then got married last week and then advocated
(21:33) that [ __ ] the 1500 girls was incorrect and then advocated for the married lifestyle based on the values
(21:39) that you currently hold there would be no hypocrisy well okay sorry
(21:44) I quite convenient and then we're not Hypocrites okay no I'm like well hang on
(21:49) what do you think hypocrite means what do you think that that means I think that if you guys didn't wait till
(21:55) marriage you don't know what it's like in the [ __ ] pain that men are going through I get clients like this all the
(22:01) time that are like because I'd like to know what you think hypocrite means though we not an example someone I mean
(22:08) someone who's living a life different than what they're proclaiming like the Ral
(22:15) Crepes you were well but are we currently doing that no but any ex and
(22:22) surgery well GI PR is on a doubt we can't currently be Hypocrites we could only be hippos so birth ask you were
(22:30) past Hypocrites then no we weren't even past Hypocrites we would only be past Hypocrites if in the past we were doing
(22:36) that while advocating against or your don't you think it's more convenient that you're like that your value system
(22:42) this just goes along with what you're doing this is like a guy who's L saying yeah it's pretty convenient yeah that's
(22:48) what it's supposed to do steing feeling it wrong steing it so wrong well do just
(22:53) for today just for today it's okay and now well wait hang on hang on back up
(22:58) why would your values not change uh and then you advocate for what the you are
(23:04) that doesn't mean is absolute I think that it can be absolute depending on
(23:10) your worldview let me explain let me explain like for you you guys are married now so you can get plenty of sex
(23:15) assumingly from your wives right but so it's it's pretty easy for you guys to say now well you know you should wait
(23:20) until marriage but you personally could not wait until marriage so by what not that we could not that we chose not to
(23:27) we chose not but what what right do you then tell other people that well you guys should win you guys should do well again I
(23:36) think the heroin addict is this is the Perfect Analogy where it's like somebody can be addicted to heroin for 20 years
(23:41) and then they stop for one year and they're like ve they're they're back to their sober self and they can start
(23:47) advocating against heroin use it doesn't make them a hypocrite it's not convenient it's not you can't say oh
(23:52) it's convenient for you because you're sober now I it's like no I realized what I did was wrong and now I'm advocating
(23:58) against what I was doing because it was no longer getting right versus you
(24:06) guys are still having sex from your wife okay but but wait a second so John just says well wait we just I just feel like
(24:12) we won the debate but he defined hypocrite and then defined us as not being Hypocrites so how the [ __ ] in the
(24:18) how in the world could you say that you want your definition of hypocrite no definition is what we use will will GS
(24:26) told you that hang on all then you defined it you defined it and you when you defined it you said
(24:35) it's hang t wait sem wait semantics are
(24:41) important when we're defining terms I asked you for your definition of hypocrisy you told me what it was we
(24:47) agreed with that definition and by that definition you agreed we're not Hypocrites you won nothing don't use the
(24:54) definition of hypocrite you're still it's very convenient so yeah okay fine but joh maybe John will uh revise his
(24:59) position so maybe you guys are not hypocrit by that definition I guess the point then he wants to make I'm assuming
(25:05) is that it's just very very convenient for you now to be in advocating against premarital sex now that you're married
(25:11) and having sex yeah but convenient what what's the argument for convenience what what would that matter even if we did
(25:17) the most convenient thing on our own behalf for what we Advocate that's not an
(25:23) argument what's these gentlemen here let me inter let me this is where I need to
(25:28) intervene and pull it back gentlemen what so John can you establish for the audience why in this scenario Zen and
(25:37) Andrew being Hypocrites would discredit the worldview because of
(25:43) that first of all I don't believe in ethics okay I don't believe there's an absolute basis for ethics anyone that
(25:49) studies uh you know evolutionary biology and and all these different things
(25:54) they're going to understand there's absolutely nothing if we just come to together like look at Thomas Hobbs right
(26:00) you guys are familiar with Thomas Hobs in the social contract people were just killing each other there was all kinds of nonsense happening right there was no
(26:06) law and then they came together ethics came about from the church and from the state so did monogamy okay neither of
(26:13) those things are natural what soever if you study modern Neuroscience they found that people are only
(26:18) monogamous uh if they have a certain thing in their brain we don't have it there's certain species of monkeys that have it it's it's something that's
(26:24) forced by institutions okay that's where I take issue with it I'm in agreement with some of your point regarding Pedro
(26:30) I don't yeah working on it in the back I'm working on it in the backgrounds then keep going sorry about that John
(26:36) finish your statement regarding red pill I agree I think red pill is trash I've spoken out actively against it and I'm
(26:43) not advocating that guys go [ __ ] as many girls as they can I want to make that clear all I'm doing like think of it
(26:48) this way from my point of view just give it I know you don't agree with it but any guy that wants to talk to a female
(26:54) has a strategy it's just normally a very bad strategy so we're just equipping them with a better strategy so that they
(27:00) have better chances of getting a random stranger they walk up to getting a date they don't even need to sleep with the girls but just having opportunities to
(27:07) get to know someone there's better ways of of carrying on interaction there's better ways to text than others there's
(27:13) better ways to run your date than others and everyone has a strategy so we're not doing anything different I'm not
(27:19) advocating that guys go bang as many girls as they can and use women all I'm doing is giving them better strategy so
(27:25) that they can have more dates and finding they click with and then they can settle down in a relationship or a
(27:31) marriage or they can go bang more girls which I think is also fine it's really up to them and what they want to do but
(27:38) most guys are going to end up with an ugly wife if they don't develop some character and other things that come
(27:43) along with dating a lot of girls so are you see the what of of their wives or is
(27:48) that awesome I'd like to like respond well I'd like to respond to I'll just add to that before they respond or
(27:54) should I mean that's a lot of charges laid out Alex they need to be able to address that Andrew you go and then Alex
(28:00) we'll throw it back to you for your questions okay fair enough okay so first and foremost you say that you're not
(28:06) advocating yeah like I said in the original definition which it sounds like you agree with that I laid out um the
(28:13) most charitable one that we could come up with is that you're just equipping men with the tools in order to gain the
(28:19) confidence that they need to approach women and then what they do with the tools from there is up to them would you
(28:25) read that that's kind of what you're saying here okay so you would agree that that definition essentially is correct
(28:31) the charitable one that we're using to describe kind of your outlook on this yes okay well if that's true then you
(28:38) have to reconcile that with the fact that you're [ __ ] 1500 women right
(28:44) that's the TR that's me yeah him a sex addict yeah if you're in order to
(28:50) reconcile this you're saying that as an example you being an example in this
(28:55) case for your audience what cu are they taking from you are they taking the queue to go [ __ ] 1500 women or are they
(29:02) taking the queue to go settle down with a nice wife which one do you think is more likely probably the cue uh about B A lot
(29:10) of girls yeah probably so when we talk about your value structures and your morality uh it's hard for us to assume
(29:17) that when you guys say to us we're just trying to equip men with the right tools to do the right thing that you're kind
(29:24) of full of [ __ ] because you by your own admission you're saying what what men are going to do is take my value
(29:30) structure and apply it okay Co can I can I respond can I get myor to it because I
(29:36) want to clean here I want to clean up what John said earlier because Ashley and is somewhat decent
(29:45) Point not the perfect I think a much better way of phrasing that is it just hurts your credibility it's like who
(29:51) used to steal to feed their starving family but once they move to a first full country where food is abundant they
(29:56) go on and they say oh you should never steal to uh to feed your family it's so unethical meanwhile you used to do the
(30:02) same thing when you didn't have food it's the same thing here yeah now that you're getting sex from your wife you're saying oh it's so unethical to have sex
(30:08) you know outside wedlock but then when you didn't have a wife you were doing that so I don't think it's hypocritical I just think it hurts her credibility
(30:14) the hypocritic Alex Alex just to you kind of throw a wrench in that
(30:19) like real quick real the analogy the analogy here that like if you
(30:25) really you're G to you're going to Gish I want to throw a r Zen you have to let him finish I think this is where you got
(30:32) to take notes I will give it to you Nick keep finish Alex I take massive amounts
(30:37) of notes Let me let me finish this point I'm almost done the hypocritical part I will actually point out the hypocritical part the hypocritical part came in the
(30:44) first debate that I had with Andrew when he was accusing me of encouraging behavior that hurts health because admittedly if you have a lot of casual
(30:50) sets you know you can basically catch an STD there's a small risk of that and that hurts your health the hypocritical
(30:56) part is while he's saying that he's pain smoking cigarettes which directly hurts his health so that is the hypocritical
(31:01) part that's a hypocritical component the previous thing about you guys uh having sex before marriage that just hurts your
(31:07) credibility so let me tell you like if in regard to your first analogy about like being living in a third world
(31:13) country where you had to steal food to survive or just living poor where you had to steal food to survive and then you you know acquire you know a solid
(31:20) grounding for your for your quality of life and you don't need to steal anymore and you say oh that's immoral well to to
(31:27) make this perfectly analogous wouldn't it have to be the case that we were like incels in and I mean like the literal
(31:32) definition of incel like involuntary celibate like we're celibate but we aren't doing it intentionally we just
(31:37) didn't have access to sex now we've got a wife where we where we do have access to sex and we say that it's immoral what
(31:45) if what if the two of us actually did have access to premarital sex and we
(31:50) were doing it so it was available it was available to do so it's it's not like
(31:55) the food it's not like um your analogy with the food where it wasn't available so if we're if we actually
(32:01) have access to sex and we're not and then and then we choose to go into a
(32:06) monogamous uh marriage then we aren't doing it out of necessity because we
(32:12) already had access to the sex prior we're not just doing it because it's so convenient and it makes us these moral
(32:17) grandstanders we're doing it because we do truly believe that's what's right we're not just um hpoc and Aly but you
(32:25) didn't have access to your wife that's the thing that so it is analgous because
(32:30) you did not have access to your wife because you weren't married yet that's why you were having premarital sex well Al but now that you're married you're
(32:37) now you're now you're saying you shouldn't do it let's say let's say you the cred I I just want to ask you this okay because I need you to kind of
(32:44) understand this concept I know I know that John does he's he's got it down pat but okay um if your brother raped a girl
(32:50) let's say horribly horrifically and he went to prison for 10 years and he came out and he advocated that people no
(32:56) longer rape girls would you call him a hypocrite no but I would say it hurts
(33:02) his credibility okay why would it hurt his credibility wouldn't he have the most amount of credibility to tell you
(33:08) what you shouldn't do considering that he did that because he's telling you not to do something especially when he's morally grandstanding something that he
(33:14) did well wait wait wouldn't he have the most credibility Al Alex because he can
(33:20) draw the best comparison having had both for instance we're on this panel and we
(33:26) are both married you are both not married but all four of us have slept with women outside of wedlock we have the
(33:32) experience of both to make the analogy between the two so we can make a better determination for which is better that's
(33:39) one and two can you explain to me how it is that he wouldn't have better experience determinative experience
(33:46) having done both of those things to be the the the kind of deal breaker there to explain to people why this is bad
(33:53) these are the results of it this kind of thing and you would you would say that he has no credibility even though he he
(34:01) himself uh experienced it did it this type of thing you think that that makes a lot of sense Alex it takes away from
(34:07) his credibility when he's advocating against something that he used to do and also I think the analogy isn't perfectly
(34:13) analogous because this we're talking about something we're talking about sex right
(34:18) now almost no analogy is perfectly analogous but it is analogous it's
(34:24) barely it because now you have access to sex through your wife right so now you now that you have access to but did we
(34:30) but did we have access to sex before our wives not with your wife but did we have access to sex before our wives I don't
(34:37) know I'm you're saying you do so I'll just take okay so if you're taking Mark word for it that we had uh access to sex
(34:43) before our wives and access to sex with our wives then we have the most amount of experience to draw from to speak on
(34:49) both of these issues right yeah but it's also major credibility issue because when you when you weren't no credibility
(34:55) issue okay well if you let me finish I'll explain before you were married uh you were like oh yeah you know you were thinking well I guess there's nothing
(35:01) wrong with having pratal sex now that you get married and you have your wife's [ __ ] to fall back on and then you're
(35:07) saying oh well people shouldn't have prenatural sex when it was something that you were doing before you had
(35:12) access to your wife's [ __ ] it's just not this isn't the right Avenue to go down dude it's like I mean literally you
(35:18) could you could do this with literally anything you could say that like a two-year-old doesn't have access to mathematics but then when they turned
(35:24) old enough to you know comprehend mathematics now they're using it to their advantage oh how convenient they didn't have ax or TOA before but now
(35:31) they do like I mean you could literally apply that you could apply what I just did with anything and it
(35:37) would it it's okay let me try and do my job well how's it not the same
(35:43) job a two-year-old didn't have access to mathematics so you're saying quick quick
(35:49) let's walk through it let's walk through it slowly two-year-old didn't have access to mathematics premar men did not have access to married sex okay go on
(35:58) we're just we're go ahead okay and no continue from there what are you say okay so what you're
(36:04) what you're saying is that is not the same I'm showing you why the analogy is exactly the same two-year-old didn't have access to math prear man did not
(36:11) have access to married sex two two grow older he now has access to math and now
(36:17) he's using it to his advantage and whatever married man now has access to married sex and he's using there's no
(36:23) ethical implication with math yeah well there could be an ethical implication for math let's say let's say youd were a
(36:28) member of a math cult and you derived all ethics from math you could do we're already shown his analogy doesn't
(36:37) apply question like this in the in the example I get let's just say hypothetically speaking Pedro uh used to
(36:44) live in [ __ ] Somalia where he he used to steal to feed his family sorry Pedro I don't mean 300 bucks no that's good
(36:50) that's cool he used to he used to steal toa's family right is he a pirate is he a Somalian pirate some [ __ ] Somali
(36:58) back you did not he went all out he was like Eric thorman right everybody he's
(37:03) Rich then he moves to America and then he gets a job and he has access to food and then he's like you know what guys I
(37:09) think stealing even if it is to feed your starving family is morally wrong right when you say that hurts his
(37:15) credibility because he used to do that same thing before he had access to the food IES his credibility before before
(37:23) you guys go any further Alex I want to tell you right now I am so much against the Walt culture I give you my black I
(37:29) hand it I D it to you right now for the future to use in every other day you have the black card so use it at your
(37:34) disposal Max the suer out get have an end pass fa at all M would do a m but you
(37:43) ask can chats it around amongst your friends go for it Alia purely a random that's the joke though but but yeah so
(37:50) no he would have more credit Pedro Pedro real quick they're saying you're muted on The Crucible on the on The Crucible
(37:56) stream you are muted yeah so you think that were're get hro more credibility that even though he used to steal when
(38:02) it was necessary to feed his family uh now that he has food that he doesn't steal you say you think that would give him more well I'll I'll explain to you
(38:08) how maybe in an easier way okay okay so let's say you have somebody who was in
(38:14) prison and then they got out of prison and they Advocate that being out of prison is far better than being in
(38:19) prison why do they have credibility to make that claim Alex not the same dude Alex why do they
(38:27) have credibility to make that claim well you're talking about something that's no longer the case Alex why do they have
(38:33) credibility that now bled Alex you Alex that credibility made my fight why if
(38:39) you were a monk and you were no longer having Alex why would they have credibility to make that claim analogy doesn't make make sense you get a
(38:45) leading any then just answer the question if it if it doesn't make sense if it doesn't the hang on if the analogy
(38:52) makes no sense then just answer the question and then it should be nonsensical like let's find out if
(38:58) that's true you you can't answer that that question
(39:04) because well massive
(39:11) logical I if you were a mon now and you were having sex logical
(39:17) F still having so not what super nerdy
(39:23) here but like when when you invoke a logical fallacy you're going to need to like point out precisely where it
(39:30) doesn't follow what's the contradiction he's telling you you're comparing apples to oranges okay well hang on let me back
(39:35) up let me back up I'm gonna repeat the question I just want you to give me the answer to it regardless of where you
(39:42) think it'll go look okay so so how about I unload it do you think a man who has
(39:47) been in prison who leaves prison and then Advocates advocates for Freedom
(39:53) what about that's wrong let's see proov of my what do you think do you think
(39:59) means is that an assertion you're going to talk about the cart well wait is is that am I what am I
(40:06) asserting you're putting out something there that's wrong in the first place and you're asking the audience to use deductive logic show that you're right
(40:13) what am I we can follow the train of thought I'm tell right now that you dra
(40:20) this is insane look the reason you know that a person yeah the reason I'll show
(40:26) you what you're doing s we read the same do you think Santa Claus is real do you think Santa Claus is real tell me answer
(40:32) the question you think think Santa Claus is real okay and then the audience is gonna take away okay then Jesus isn't
(40:38) real either because he said s well we just this the thing is you did you did
(40:43) load a question to be like if I asked you John how long have you been gay that's a loaded question because in the
(40:49) in the S no dichotomy no matter which way you answer it be incorrect I have not asked yes no I have not asked a yes
(40:56) no question I simply ask it need to be I simp and you're wrong as s Sean Sean let
(41:03) me repeat the question and I need you to tell exactly it's just prove your it's gonna then let me ask it John to the
(41:10) audience there's something called the D are you gonna let me out a false assumption and then he's saying it's
(41:17) like Jesus existing there's another false assumption you're prence for
(41:23) that but but John you just listen to his question you have to kind of grapple with it no it's an unfair question and
(41:30) you should use with let him repat it because I've almost forgotten what the question even is this you don't have to
(41:37) answer it assumption look you don't have to answer well well Andrew he's he does not want to answer the question he
(41:43) doesn't have to I still I still want to assert my question back to Alex okay Alex if a man was in prison and after he
(41:52) gets out of prison he Advocates that freedom and being out of prison is better than being in prison do you think
(41:59) this is hold on this is I have to step in this is an unfair thing the audience doesn't
(42:08) understand literally only Ru the is you're only gonna create more
(42:14) chaos John I'm I'm I'm telling you right now I understand as another debater why
(42:20) you don't want to answer the question that's cool it's not no dude
(42:26) but you're not allowed to not allow the other Debaters to not feel the question let me save my position please okay okay
(42:33) so you can so you can understand okay with his example where he said to me are you gay answer the question right or do
(42:40) you like man what was it that wasn't the question the question was how long have they been gay okay so for the record I'm
(42:46) not into dudes whatsoever no no
(42:53) that's BL manager no you're [ __ ] not dude I don't believe you when did you drop out that's that's an unloaded
(42:59) question what did you drop out doesn't get
(43:06) personal it doesn't need to get personal John I get I get what you're saying just let Alex try and interact with Andrew's
(43:13) question dude this is off the rails okay you can't [ __ ] load up a question
(43:19) with a bad assumption just to get a little show for the was a bad assumtion P they SP your sorry hey guys I'm sorry
(43:27) Pedro they still can't hear you and that in but the m at the same time and and
(43:32) then he says you guys are scared to answer the question no he's making an unfair move and as a referee you need to
(43:37) call it a helmet you stood up not explained what's loaded what the unfair assumption is what we have yes see yeah
(43:44) why don't you do it again and we're gonna be quiet on this side but you need to actually explain the logical fallacy
(43:51) or the assumption that I'm making that's incorrect or anything like that in just asking this question that's that's say
(43:57) but I'm you got the floor okay I'll let Alex feel it because I like the way he put it yeah well what what I'm saying is
(44:05) so uh is that you're comparing apples to oranges and you're setting up a premise or you're pretending like we're
(44:10) comparing Apples to Apples I will happily follow your train of logic I'm just pointing out that it is flawed so
(44:16) if you want to ask this question I will I will I will humor it uh but because I don't want the the Assumption made that
(44:21) I'm afraid to answer questions but I'm telling you like your line of logic right now where you were going is entirely flawed uh because again explain
(44:28) why explain why soain why so everyone can know we want you to admit that apples are apples when they're oranges
(44:33) and Pedro is saying we're scared because we don't want to say apples and oranges are different he's not saying you're snowed he's not say you're scared in in
(44:40) the in in the example that Andrew where that he was going with he was going to say well a person who gets out of prison
(44:46) doesn't have a really good basis to talk about uh you know why going to prison is a bad thing right and he's going to use
(44:53) that to compare it to his own situation where he was uh you know he was was having casual sex but now that he's married he's more or less reformed but
(45:01) that analogy does not apply because he's still having sex it would only apply if Andrew was now a monk who completely uh
(45:07) abstained from sex and his argument was that sex is evil then that analogy would be analogous and that would be perfect
(45:13) then you can make that all right you then you ought be able to make a claim against this or you ought be able to
(45:19) answer it in a way that makes sense in the context of what you're saying so let me field the question to you one more
(45:25) time no he doing it again this is [ __ ] dumb understand James I it out
(45:33) John so it's not analogous I reject that and I can prove it by following logic
(45:40) and we're going to determine which one of us is correct and which one of us is wrong well what's the problem we at John
(45:47) can you tell me what the issue is there you know what the problem is no there's no problem Alex just explained to you no
(45:53) Alex explained he explained his assumption and I re re his assumption
(45:58) how so because because he he put in a presupposition that I'm going to compare
(46:04) this to some other bizarre situation he has no idea what any any comparison's going to be has no idea nothing there's
(46:10) no reason for him not to answer the question let him answer it I know what it is because I heard the question and it's apples and oranges so well
(46:18) well yeah yeah how about this guys Alex if you want to interact right now tell me so if not we'll move on if so we'll
(46:26) just we're going to go to a different line question okay we'll move on we'll move on why don't you guys feel whatever
(46:32) questions you want to us we'll actually answer them you do that then yeah
(46:42) hang Pedro unmute hang on I just want to tell Pedra unmute yourself or no mute yourself on The Crucible stream and then
(46:49) send all your audio through here and that way when you're sharing the audio it'll just feed Through The Crucible but
(46:54) mute yourself on The Crucible stream gotcha good to go okay so yeah I don't want to set the president that we're not
(47:00) answering questions that's not what it is dud you know listen [ __ ] leave if this is
(47:07) gonna be an unfair fight I'll [ __ ] leave like Pedro is not doing his job straight up I think
(47:15) like Alex I gotta say right now I'm not Captain SEO so if he wants to leave he
(47:20) can leave but for well different line we can move to a different line if we want
(47:27) yeah but not we're not scared to answer his [ __ ] line of questioning okay this no one said you were scared John
(47:33) yeah no I just let's just said Alex really quick even as a fellow debater
(47:39) John I know what you're saying I understand what you're saying I know why you're discrediting the argument I get
(47:47) it you don't want to answer the question I would in some instances say the same thing on different subjects if this kind
(47:53) of thing has been done I'm not calling you afraid no no one calls you afraid okay that's leave we can move now clear
(48:01) I'm I'm not going to keep [ __ ] bulling around guys he's saying we'll actually answer the question so the audience is like they don't want to
(48:07) answer the question yeah but I don't care what your audience think like about logic and reason John I don't give a
(48:13) [ __ ] wait thing John I don't [ __ ] care about your audience John answer my I'll you I'll send you a mathematical
(48:19) proof after I'll make it a community post to show you where your logic is wrong right you're going to do it should
(48:25) it should be simple it should it should be S to point out where like in premise one premise two conclusion it does the
(48:31) Sol which this to a different line of questions just Alex Alex I'm gonna hand
(48:36) it to you ask a different question to send us on a different line go okay in spirit of being Sol if with standing
(48:42) with solidarity with my team partner I'll just move on to a different line of questioning uh okay
(48:48) uh my mind went totally off track uh okay I want to go back to what Zen was saying in his uh opening statement uh so
(48:56) let me just because I wrote down what he was saying I want to just quickly uh okay so hold on what are the what the
(49:02) rules here like in like no there was invoked was I was no interrupting really
(49:08) and no person okay but that's we leading the witness and the judge is supposed to come in and [ __ ] stop that and a
(49:14) lawyer can yell objection when I did that we were painted out to be scared so I just want to know what's going on here
(49:19) well I objected to your objection so so shouldn't we leave it to the judge to see who they fall down on
(49:25) since he's the judge well we can't cuz the The Crucible stream can't [ __ ] hear Pedro we can't appeal to the
(49:31) moderator right now we got to handle this between us but Ian appeal to the moderator the moderator can hear us so
(49:38) if you say in a court of law objection and I object to your objection who do we appeal to John the judge okay well great
(49:45) so then now the judge says that is okay for me to ask the question you shouldn't have any complaints right
(49:50) John you're doing it again Telly said my dude it's your Ric and
(49:56) reasoning child let's just keep this on track Pedro pH what is your decision are
(50:01) we moving to a different line of questioning yes okay okay there we go let's try to like not get into personal
(50:08) attacks just gonna derail the whole thing he already he already has he's been nesting them in all this [ __ ]
(50:13) response I know that's that's what I'm saying let's not I'm sorry to keep I'm sorry to keep like interrupting with
(50:18) this stuff but apparently Pedro nobody can hear you on either stream it's okay
(50:24) want back it want be can hear you okay yeah do we think that I really
(50:29) think we should take a second that audio issue let's take a second let's fix that and then we'll get back into it we just
(50:35) take a break because we're gonna go down a new line anyway we're not we're not really cutting anything off here so okay
(50:40) one's in Alex's chat if you can hear me right now this is just Alex's stream just so yeah I took I took it
(50:48) down for a second don't worry and I'm notna start ones if you can hear Pedro
(50:54) they are all putting ones in so they can hear you okay perfect okay good to go now one
(51:05) second guess it's good on Alex's [Music]
(51:11) stream on the plus side we have 370 live viewers so uh yeah we're chilling everybody hit the like button yeah
(51:28) uh just let me know whenever you guys have it fixed on your end we'll just
(51:36) work okay one On's in Alex's chat if you can still hear
(51:41) me okay On's in Alex's chat if you can still hear Pedro one more
(51:48) time okay we got one one beautiful beautiful okay yep they can
(51:53) hear you okay now I'm bringing our
(51:59) stream still should be good okay why wouldn't
(52:06) be you're showing the chat right now okay
(52:12) so all right one's in our chat on our stream if you can hear us all right chat
(52:18) Crucible chat one's in chat if you can hear Pedro
(52:27) still says muted got zero got zero z z just move him over to Alex's chat yeah
(52:34) everybody I'm gonna send you the link you're gonna have to watch this on um uh keep the stream running keep the stream
(52:40) running on our chat on ours but to send everybody everybody get into playing with fire get into his live stream but
(52:47) boost his algorithm and like his [ __ ] too I mean he's hosting the [ __ ] debate for you know so go over there go
(52:53) to Playing with Fire put the link in chat for him Pedro let's moving with the debate [ __ ] I put the wrong I put the
(52:58) wrong once your words you can obviously you're more than welcome to just take this and repost on your channel we we'll probably do exactly that we'll probably
(53:05) uh download it and then re-upload it but for now get over there to uh literally
(53:12) type it in you know okay let me know when you're ready for me to continue P right actually I was gonna hand it
(53:19) over to John so JN feels like he's been slided right now and I'm trying to remedy that so I want to hand it over to
(53:27) take us with your next question that you have John can I can I do like a point BYO
(53:33) response because I think Andrew uh made some points that I that I want to respond to but I didn't take full notes
(53:39) so like yes let me just like piecing through like so okay so like I bang 1500
(53:44) girls I probably am a sex ad addict right I'll admit that but I tell my
(53:49) students very clearly that the goal is not to bang a lot of girls even though that I did that I tell them that that's
(53:56) how I made the system so good because I evolved and optimized it with all that data well does that make you a hypocrite
(54:04) John no because I tell them they lot of grou they want to no because they can bang a lot of grou they want to I don't
(54:10) tell them any I don't give them any well that's awful convenient John it's awful convenient isn't it that you're just
(54:17) flowing whatever your ethical flow is with what your current Bel I don't have I don't have an Absolut right so the
(54:23) thing is though is that aren't you being hypocritical by living same charge against us in your internal fatigue that
(54:28) makes no sense John no because I'm not advocating that guys shouldn't fuckle out of chicks I'm not doing the opposite
(54:34) of that they can go [ __ ] a lot of chicks if they want I'm not defining what their direction is I'm just equipping them with a better strategy right but earlier
(54:41) we had already gone over this and I asked you which one do you you thought was more likely if you thought that they were more likely to follow the the in
(54:48) suit for what you're doing banging 1500 chicks or if it's more likely that they're going to go like settle down and
(54:55) get married uh you had conceded that you thought it was far more likely that they would follow suit with you we actually
(55:02) we did a poll on this we did a poll on this in our Channel and 40% said they want to date multiple girls I think like
(55:09) 20 or 30% wanted to have a monogamous girlfriend so the reason why I make such a big deal out of how many girls I sleed
(55:15) with is just to show proof that I've actually gone through in Donal situations thousands of times okay so
(55:20) then by your poll I'm correct and you are correct in your assumption that most of them are going to follow suit and try
(55:27) to have sex with lots of women right but would you argue would you agree on that that's a little you're out girls then
(55:33) him making a strong position and saying well I mean what does that mean take to seeing a lot of girls at once doesn't
(55:38) that infer that it's likely that they're going to have sex with a lot of girls or they're going to try to have sex with M
(55:45) they're play Rotation which means just at least more than one sexual just a non monogamous casual dating situation right
(55:50) are comparing apples to oranges again it would be app hole that's empiricism now how are we comparing or yeah well I'm
(55:58) going to explain it it would be analogous if John was now saying yo I don't think you should have sex with a lot of girls I think you should only
(56:03) have sex with one girl then you would have a point uh if he changed his position like that if he did a 180 on
(56:09) that position then you would have a point that it would be extremely hurt his credibility he's focusing on the
(56:14) dimension of just what I appear on the like you know on my channel when I'm talking bang lot of girls what what are
(56:19) guys gonna take away from that but that's just a problem potentially with the messaging I try to use that as proof
(56:24) to show that I'm different than these other guys in the space but I agree that the messaging could give guys the wrong idea right and we've actually noticed
(56:31) that internally and we've made adjustments over the past couple months to not focus on that as but what but
(56:37) your own internal polling shows they 40% want to be dating more
(56:42) than one girl right so your internal polling shows that regardless of what the adjustments that doesn't mean tons of girls okay even even if it doesn't
(56:50) it's going to be more than one in a monogamous relationship and certainly none of them are clamoring to get married if they're dating old school
(56:56) girls like he's not saying it's bad he's not going the opposite direction he's just saying that he's agnostic about it
(57:03) he wants his clients as far as I understand to do what's best for them I'm not I'm just getting a n strategy not I'm not even arguing that is that
(57:10) correct John like you're you're kind of agnostic about this you don't care if your clients strategy no I don't tell
(57:15) them all I don't tell them at all that how many girls they should be with or that they should date multiple girls yeah you're agnostic about their goal
(57:21) all I'm doing like like let me let me simplify my position more like if you realize that um like let's say let's say
(57:27) a guy that knew nothing about formal pickup um realized that when he says like a vers B the girl responds more
(57:34) positive to a and he tells his friend like Hey try saying this instead he's just now taught that guy a better
(57:39) strategy that's going to in the long run presumably you know it's small sample size but for the argument's sake we
(57:46) could increase the sample size if there's a better move at certain junctures and he told his friend about
(57:51) that then that would be increasing his odds of getting more dates so that's all I'm doing that's my only job is just you
(57:57) got John we' already guys all have a strategy this just a bad one yeah but John we've already established uh both of us that that
(58:05) coincides with our very charitable definition of what you guys think you're doing our counterargument to that is
(58:12) that's nice that you say that that's what you're doing but what's happening in reality is you're training men to be
(58:17) simps for lots of vagina and then when you do an internal pull essentially proving that that's true now we have
(58:24) empirical evidence to go with argument yeah hang on I'll finish and then you
(58:30) guys can critique it if you'd like to but now we have an internal poll essentially proving that that's exactly
(58:36) true that these men want to have multiple relationships with multiple different women clearly they're taking
(58:41) their cues from you on that why wouldn't they be not necessarily well where else would they be getting it from do you
(58:47) think Society Andre Tate people that are popular I mean possibly they could be
(58:53) but don't you think it's likely that they're getting it from the person that they're watching who whose audience they're in who Advocates those values
(59:00) doesn't that seem like it's the most cyly thing like that a bad exemp potentially but it's different than pick
(59:07) up being bad I simplify this by just asking John a simple question John do
(59:12) you and what's your what's your answer to this do you think it's bad if some of your clients use your content or my
(59:19) content to have multiple girlfriends or you agnostic okay here we go we've simplified this so yeah back to saying
(59:26) earlier we comparing apples to oranges John is saying that I'm going to simplify this very simply John is saying
(59:31) he doesn't really care if use his content to get a wife to get several girlfriends to have a lot of casual sex
(59:38) he's AOS on this issue which is not the same as you guys because you're not agnostic on people having prematal sex
(59:45) you're actively saying that it's a bad thing do you are you following my logic sure keep
(59:51) going that's that's the point I'm trying to make so I'm just literally out to you
(59:57) this analogy where you said well isn't it a little convenient for you like you're basically taking our logic and trying to flip it on John but it doesn't
(1:00:02) apply because it's not the same thing no it still does apply and your point your point has no merit as to where this
(1:00:08) argument is going so well okay go ahead well I just want I just want to make clarification I think we're tpping into
(1:00:14) two different things I agree with his point that I'm potentially setting a bad example but we're I thought we were
(1:00:21) discussing pickup in in strategy as as a thing on its own apart from any Creator well we are so there's multiple points
(1:00:28) which I put in my opening and I'll gladly bring those points up and we can address them one at a time the first one
(1:00:34) is John I do have to ask this directly because it is pertinent to this debate this is not an atom but I do want to
(1:00:41) know the answer to it did you have sex with transsexual women yeah I've mentioned on my channel that I've been
(1:00:47) with two different transexuals that didn't have okay first of all they didn't have a dick okay they had
(1:00:55) estrogen put into their body and I read in a lot of Neuroscience books that a lot of the I know a lot of people can't
(1:01:00) [ __ ] get it to me it's looks like a duck quacks like a duck it's a duck okay I'm not at all like for the record
(1:01:06) people try to make fun of this for the record I'm not even slightly induced a lot of times the hottest chicks in the
(1:01:11) club apparently you are well hang on Z let him let him finish okay okay let's say let's say
(1:01:17) that one of you guys in your premarital sex days banged a chick that you thought was a tent right and then you found out
(1:01:24) five years later that that was really a train does that make you gay you yeah hang on mute yourself Pedro I'm getting
(1:01:30) an echo off of you got it one second you if you hooked up with someone that looked like a hawk female like a nine or
(1:01:36) 10 out of 10 and then five years later you found out that that was a transsexual that doesn't make you gay it
(1:01:42) do like you g even if you knew okay okay well let's just say that we grant you that that's true and by the way we're
(1:01:48) still getting an echo somewhere but let's just say we grant you that that's true there it is it's gone let's just say that we grant you that that's true
(1:01:54) don't you think there's a distinction to be made if you know that they are uh
(1:02:02) biologically uh a a male don't you think that there's a huge distinction there John no because as I said in my
(1:02:09) Neuroscience books like the sexual part of a transexuals brain is female in a lot of these cases and they get estrogen
(1:02:15) pumped in okay okay hang on fair enough then is that's a female to me but then wait John backs your point then why did
(1:02:21) you present this as if you found out 10 years later and you didn't know at the
(1:02:26) time verto for for your for your right right versus you do know at the time and
(1:02:32) you do it anyway now I got to ask you since you see to that yeah like I'm not
(1:02:37) I'm not saying like I'm basically saying like for you to look at it from that point of view like if you bang let's say
(1:02:42) it's hypothetically possible that you could have hooked up with a transsexual and you didn't know it or it could have happened to anyone right it could happen
(1:02:48) to someone and then they find out later that it was a really a guy but there's no knowledge there a you're into men
(1:02:55) yeah but there's no knowledge there but my point is that it's it it has all the characteristics of a female
(1:03:01) but there's no but well wait even if it did like let's say say for a second
(1:03:07) let's say someone that looks very pretty with say yes with no dick with estrogen
(1:03:12) John that's there there's a huge distinction here let's say that I took a ton of magic mushrooms and suddenly I
(1:03:19) saw a man as being a beautiful woman not but let's just say I did because I was
(1:03:24) not old thing you're right ever gonna be allowed to ask a [ __ ] question don't answer all
(1:03:30) of your are you ever gonna let you do that yeah guys I think it's fair I've allowed you Alex and John to fill a lot
(1:03:37) of questions right I think I think it is fair for Andrew to get some question in now you just can't take little another
(1:03:45) [ __ ] line I'll just work completely in your framework then there's no intent John no the distinction is intent so I
(1:03:52) have to ask you you had knowledge that these were biological males now you love science You' said that science is
(1:03:59) something that you're into especially Neuroscience doesn't matter if brain scans say that their gender is female
(1:04:06) what is their biological sex John again it's not you're asking a
(1:04:12) leading question that's how all of your arguments are based now I see why people will lose debates against you guys what
(1:04:17) let me let me unpack let me unpack that what's their biological sex John let me
(1:04:23) unpack that a transvesti female looks far different from a male okay a male
(1:04:29) that looks like a male sure you're saying they're the same because they share the same chromosome they're not the same they're totally different well
(1:04:35) wait a second I didn't say anything about them sharing the same chromosome so therefore they were the same that would be that wait that would be an xxxy
(1:04:43) distinction I'm asking theal wait wait biological hey I'm sorry I'm so sorry to
(1:04:49) interrupt I'm so sorry but I just got it working I think on The Crucible can you guys still in The Crucible chat confirm
(1:04:55) that we have audio on our end people are saying that audio is back so everybody that went over to Alex's channel uh we
(1:05:02) would like to Grace Mo direct you back Channel his channel
(1:05:10) but it's correct now Zin stop this argum
(1:05:16) John there is no [ __ ] way that you could ever say that it's a leading question for me to ask you biologically
(1:05:23) what these people were what were they John how he inated its name by biological sex therefore they seeme in
(1:05:30) real life but they're totally different they the same via biological set D can we have Andrew just quickly
(1:05:36) clarify what the purpose of this line of questioning is because the per sets up
(1:05:41) every argument this way the only purpose if I'm being honest just to make John look B
(1:05:46) oh you okay well then dude I what you're say wait John John pause John just pause
(1:05:53) for a second so Alex may be correct Andrew can you give us the end to the
(1:05:58) line of the well first of all first of all I'll walk you through everything first of all even if the whole purpose
(1:06:03) of it intently was just to make John look bad who gives a [ __ ] it's an argument that's one D hang no discuss
(1:06:11) even if this was I mean even if it was even if that was the whole point Alex it's an argument doesn't matter two uh
(1:06:18) the distinction here is to say to John John uh if you're advocating pickup
(1:06:25) artistry for men going after women right but then you associate biological men as
(1:06:31) women then I'm going to associate your pickup Artistry as being slightly different than what you're saying it is
(1:06:37) if you associate men who just dress like women who've had bottom surgery as the
(1:06:43) or or men who've had bottom surgery and putting on a wigets then being women now we have an entirely new category and
(1:06:50) distinction for this value structure you're advocating for this is very problematic for me and I don't
(1:06:56) understand it and you further you further qualify this by saying look my
(1:07:02) definition of homosexual is same seex activity that's the definition you'll find scientifically as well everywhere
(1:07:09) so I have to ask you why this is a straw man or why it's bad to say what is their
(1:07:15) sex yeah well really quick I got just Alex Alex does that did did that explain
(1:07:21) or clarify it's not just a methodology to make John look bad it is a legit attack for the moral system well I
(1:07:27) personally think this is completely off topic for the uh let me respond let me respond so okay so I'm not at all into
(1:07:37) guys that look like guys okay and I'm not even that into [ __ ] transexuals most guys that I know that are b multip
(1:07:43) or girls have [ __ ] the training one or two okay it's a lot of them have done it that none of them are actually into guys
(1:07:49) at all okay nor are they gay it doesn't matter if you say the definition is biologically here's the problem with
(1:07:55) your ARG you can't say that a man that looks like a man and a man that looks like a perfect 10 female are the same because
(1:08:02) they share the same chromosome or because they share the same biological sex you can't say that what and I and I
(1:08:09) just told you why because great John let's say that a person let me let me
(1:08:14) continue because I want to respond to your points and I just let you go through so let me let me explain what that means further right so for all
(1:08:21) intensive purposes if a thing has the the sexual brain of a female and it has
(1:08:26) estrogen in the body and it has fake tits and there's no dick to me that looks like a duck quacks like a duck
(1:08:32) it's a duck I don't like anyone could be tricked by that you can imagine that happening and then my my point of saying
(1:08:39) what if you didn't know and then later you found out you would have enjoyed that experience you you might have been bragged about it to your friends because
(1:08:44) the girl looks super hot then five years later you find out it was a [ __ ] by some circumstance and now all of a
(1:08:50) sudden that makes you gay no you take gay what do you take W up with that
(1:08:56) person thinking it was a hot female okay and you had the experience as if it were a hot female and that's what I did those
(1:09:03) couple times what do you gay to be that doesn't mean I'm in the chicks I'm mean the [ __ ] too what do you take gay to
(1:09:09) be guys that are [ __ ] sucking dick and and taking it in the ass and like men that look like men we you're saying
(1:09:16) like we could use this for anything you could say real quick real quick real quick if a woman a biological female
(1:09:23) with a working vagina in no let's say no fake thck no bottom surgery whatever um
(1:09:30) but she dresses like a man cuts her hair like a man acts like a man let's say she lifs weights she's jacked and a man has
(1:09:36) sex with her in the vagina in the working functioning vagina that she was born with is he gay because she looks
(1:09:42) like man no idea how this relates to initial debates oh it's you
(1:09:50) pass wa would that make would that be gay to have sex with a manly looking woman with a with a functioning
(1:09:57) vagina okay's yeah let's bring it back says on thurs this now it says I think
(1:10:03) this deserves a clarification once again I know you you kind of made it before Andrew but one more
(1:10:10) time wait this is crucial we're at the Pinnacle Point we would just like the answers to these very basic questions
(1:10:17) this isn't tough this isn't hard please answer Zen's question okay so if a man
(1:10:23) is hooking up with something that looks like a hot female that doesn't make him gay if a woman is hooking up with something that looks like a hot male
(1:10:30) that doesn't make her or uh how would it go the other way around what you know what I'm saying no no I'm saying if a
(1:10:35) man like you or me there's one of us on this panel who looks and is functionally male and we we interpret to be a man has
(1:10:42) sex with a manly looking female in the functioning working vagina is he gay
(1:10:50) that looks like a man yeah yeah she like has a short hair L that with my definition that would be more like a gay
(1:10:57) act yes would that that would be gay it's the looks like a duck quacks like a duck thing it's not it's love GI let's
(1:11:04) say he gets her pregnant too he's gay right you're just playing with definitions and he got his and he got
(1:11:10) and did he get his boy did he get his boyfriend all definitions aside I'm
(1:11:15) attracted to things that look like hot chicks the end yeah I mean we get it we
(1:11:21) get it but the drive in here uh isn't it's an important distinction especially
(1:11:27) when we're talking about your prism and your worldview and how you looked at things what does John's sexual preferences have anything to do with
(1:11:34) prematal sex well because because we're looking at an advocation for what it is that John's advocating for and John's
(1:11:41) advocating that if something just looks hot [ __ ] it but you're make you're trying to make her a character argument
(1:11:47) like you're trying to how is this character because he John all right did
(1:11:52) that mean he's gay hi this is all [ __ ] Alex he admitted that he had sex with multiple
(1:12:00) transexual he's not denying well wait so how the character assassination for us to ask about his value structure based
(1:12:07) around that I I caned one say let's just let's just address let me let me put say
(1:12:12) the last final wait but John we gotta let Alex get in you've been talking a lot J you're trying to and you here I'm
(1:12:22) not at all into guy into guys or things that look like guys and I'm not banging lots of [ __ ] either look for the
(1:12:28) record there was two it was two times where it looked like a hot chick and you can't even tell the [ __ ] difference
(1:12:34) and I didn't give a [ __ ] and I still don't give a [ __ ] that doesn't make mean I'm in the guys okay I Gotta Throw it to
(1:12:39) Alex now Alex get in there for argument sake and this is not true but for argument sake let's assume I bang 20,000
(1:12:45) [ __ ] that still has absolutely nothing to do with the you guys got to Throttle
(1:12:51) Down Alex you got to Throttle Down the t- word there bro you're you the hard the hard wise don't do that on on yeah
(1:12:58) don't do that [ __ ] it's better you can you can actually get banned on YouTube for that I think just is say something
(1:13:03) else anything else all right my bad uh yeah okay so let's just assume I bang 20 million Transformers that still has
(1:13:10) absolutely zero to do with the argument of whether prematal sex is good or bad and I think this is like the pattern
(1:13:16) where like these debates devolve we get off topic and devolve into like personal character attacks it would be like
(1:13:22) Andrew it would be like if I was going down your sex history history I'll be I was like you did and called me a
(1:13:28) hypocrite for it things that were relevant to discussion by right well this relevant to the discussion Alex you
(1:13:34) you Haven still haven't shown how it was Rel yeah I I well I did multiple times would you would you like me to explain
(1:13:40) it one more time that your I point is that changes my teachings if I well not
(1:13:45) just that but it changes it changes the moral purview in which uh which our arguments grounding and Foundations rest
(1:13:53) upon it's important for us to understand the distinction in how you guys view the world if we're going off the definition
(1:13:59) of pickup that I gave in the beginning which you both agreed to now in that definition I said the word woman to date
(1:14:06) a woman to go after women women women women you both agreed to those terms now
(1:14:13) hang on now we get to what a hang on now we get to what a woman is and suddenly there's a little bit of [ __ ]
(1:14:19) confusion here and I want that confusion to be alleviated I all point there any confusion all okay how you no no Alex
(1:14:27) lar is z wait they gota to that I want to clear I want to clear I
(1:14:34) want to clarify Alex said there's no confusion I promise you get to respond we're saying there is confusion because
(1:14:39) the two of us have a definition of that is that has a hard line that is distinct from what you guys Words Answer just I I
(1:14:47) hear I hear you John Zen I need to Andrew just laid out a full point they
(1:14:53) have to address it and then it gets to you okay this has to be the way I already said what I need to say so let
(1:14:59) them go let me tell you really quick let no no no I need to tell you the problem all
(1:15:05) of you is this right now you all have been doing a little bit not a lot of diet tribing and then each party has to
(1:15:13) address a lot of things I don't agree with that I've been it up okay go ahead
(1:15:19) okay let's go Alex it's okay we can solve the training thing very quickly okay I'm not into
(1:15:24) things that look like dudes I bang two chicks want things that I consider chicks I don't consider those dudes at
(1:15:30) all they look they share all the characteristics of females and it doesn't change my ideology or my ethical
(1:15:36) system or my teachings but it does but it does because the idiom here is that
(1:15:41) if you're trying to teach men how to go after women the death you're not listen
(1:15:48) what I just said I did listen to what you just said the definition of a woman here is going to be very important our
(1:15:54) definition of a woman is no it's not yes it is and our definition of woman here is very simple playing games no there's
(1:16:01) no there's no game there's literally no game the only game is that you dodge
(1:16:06) every single point that's made the definition of from our standpoint is adult human female the definition of a
(1:16:13) woman for you is whatever you want to [ __ ] that you think is hot no well then what is it in to you okay you admitted
(1:16:20) that you could have been tricked by a transsexual and find out years later correct or incorrect you aded that
(1:16:25) already are you we can we can engage that in the realm of logical possibility
(1:16:30) I suppose okay so since you can bang something does okay but you went in there banging it because you're
(1:16:36) attracted to hot females I presume and not men with dicks right I don't know I have no idea what the presumption you I
(1:16:43) have no idea I've never had sex with a transexual no I'm saying are you attracted to women or to men has a l
(1:16:48) like yeah to biological Fe they interacted the things that look like hot chicks and share all the characters to
(1:16:55) hot chicks the end okay yeah but that's but wait that's subjective and it's not a definition of a woman yeah that you're
(1:17:01) creating an infinite reg why we need to Define otherwise you're creating a logical
(1:17:07) fallacy something you're creating a logical fallacy after he finishes of an infinite regress you're just saying a
(1:17:12) woman is a woman is a woman is a woman is a woman is a woman is a woman John I need you to do H up just real
(1:17:19) specifically John what is a woman this is ad hoc and a that's
(1:17:26) not is a woman Sam wait hand it hand the question over if you want to to Al Alex
(1:17:32) Alex you can answer that or engage with something else should what is the setup what's a woman
(1:17:40) is this is you set SP you set up your light of questioning to deliver your
(1:17:46) point that's give Alex the four guys Zen you're next your next Zen I'm like the
(1:17:52) batter D child no I get no speaking time okay even though it's my stream okay this is
(1:17:58) this is the problem this debate is rapidly devolving into going something completely off Tanger John is not
(1:18:04) teaching that you should [ __ ] trans uh whatever how do you know how do you know unless we know what he thinks a woman is
(1:18:11) I like similar with this content he's just s but wait see dude Pedro can you
(1:18:19) please yeah okay he's not saying that you should go out and [ __ ] things that look like girls
(1:18:26) he's saying go out and [ __ ] girls he's just saying for himself for himself he
(1:18:32) is cool with [ __ ] something that looks like a hot girl great he speak out and girl so
(1:18:38) I'm thing that you're not okay with that okay that's cool you guys are both in Koke personal preferences it is totally
(1:18:44) off topic to this debate we're talking about prematal sex what John's preferences are if I was into [ __ ]
(1:18:52) big black [ __ ] old ladies it would still be irrelevant to the topic of this
(1:18:57) debate as long as I'm not advocating that you [ __ ] old ladies Alex before I respond you're done
(1:19:03) so I get engag okay so yes it would if what you're doing is saying I'm teaching
(1:19:09) uh men to go after young hot women and then all of your streams are about going after like old black ugly chit I don't I
(1:19:16) don't know well would hang on Alex Not only would it still be relevant but here
(1:19:21) you say John is teaching men how to pick pick up girls great I accept that
(1:19:26) premise so is it appropriate for me to ask John what a girl is or what a woman is John says no I say yes because what
(1:19:34) is what John before you go John before you go Zen if you're there can you try and engage can you get in there because
(1:19:40) I've been trying to I'm sorry we just got time yeah no no continue guys continue I'll jump in
(1:19:46) my good to you go for it I'll answer Andrew's question okay this is what he wants to happen a definition of woman
(1:19:53) means you have a male chromosome or fale chromosome therefore I must have [ __ ] two men even though they look totally
(1:19:58) different from Real Men yes then that means that all my teachings are somehow obscured and invalidated I think that's
(1:20:03) a terrible argument and it's at hoc and it's irrelevant I think we should move on okay great so if that's hang on if
(1:20:10) that's true and you think it's just ad hoc and it's irrelevant and it's nonsense can you just tell me what a
(1:20:15) woman is John that's all I'm asking you're doing the same thing again that you've been doing the whole debate
(1:20:20) asking you to Define woman I told you that I think a woman is some look like a woman I could be trick and that's that's
(1:20:28) my definition well then we have a then we have a problem then we have a problem so when you say I teach men how to go
(1:20:35) get women how to approach women what you really mean is I teach men how to go and
(1:20:42) H and and approach anybody that they want to have sex with essentially is what you're actually saying no well then
(1:20:49) well then how can you get around that if your definition of a woman is just whatever you want to have sex with
(1:20:55) do you see you don't see how dumbb this point is hopefully the audience can use half a brain here I hope they can too
(1:21:00) two girls out of 1,521 okay had a male chromosome
(1:21:05) technically but still looked like hot chicks okay what percentage is that very low but wouldn't that mean
(1:21:12) that the the sexual activity that was being engaged was homosexual same sex
(1:21:19) we're giving this five more minutes guys and then we're gonna have to move on to the next Point why is that relevant like this is just I I thought he explained
(1:21:26) this a 100 times John says I teach men to pick up women I say then what is a
(1:21:31) woman John says whatever you want to have sex with that's the most relevant thing I could ever think Al has no
(1:21:38) relevance at all to the discussion you know it you're just this feels very relevant like what if somebody took what if somebody took what what the five of
(1:21:45) us on this panel interpret a dog to be and called that a woman and then said I'm advocated I'm advocated to
(1:21:54) like the woman the Paul I just said looks exactly like a woman in my example like that's
(1:22:00) a Jos listen listen you said you're a philosophy major so you understand the concept of begging the question
(1:22:06) correct yeah of course okay so when you say I I Define a woman as something that
(1:22:12) looks like a woman you're assuming the definition of woman without actually defining it you're assuming your
(1:22:18) conclusion I'm saying these question I'm saying these definitions don't matter
(1:22:23) because I'm not telling guys to go after men that look like men if you bang the TR trans you're not the fing either you
(1:22:29) have def finding there or Rob okay let's say let's say i' i' Never B to transvest let me I know how to answer this now
(1:22:36) let's say I never banged to transvest type we found out 10 years later that I did by accident does that mean the past 10 years of my teachings now are
(1:22:42) invalidated because I thought I was just teaching women but whoops if you are not willing to denounce that then it would
(1:22:49) be hypocritical it would be invalid denounce what like if like for I'll I'll
(1:22:55) give you an like if it if I it came to be that like I was married to what I thought was a woman and you know I was
(1:23:02) engaging in sex with that what I thought was a woman but then it turns out it was a man after a few years or whatever by
(1:23:07) by whatever means doesn't matter and then I said oh [ __ ] I'm having sex with a man I'm not doing I'd get divorced I'd
(1:23:15) stop you think it wasn't then I just start denounced that it wouldn't invalidate my beliefs now but if I if I
(1:23:21) found out I was married to a man and I continued being married and having sex with that man then that you would just
(1:23:27) call me gay actually the definition of a man to me that's not a man well right so
(1:23:33) so then I guess we have established that it's very important for you to tell us what a woman is John but he's already
(1:23:39) answered that question like well no no he hasn't because if he did be able to
(1:23:46) get he can miss him spe not fault I must be gay that's no I'm not even saying
(1:23:51) that you're gay I'm just asking you if a woman is you think I like men no well
(1:23:56) wait John calm down like listen you think you've had sex with men yeah you've had sex with biological men for
(1:24:03) sure biological men that yeah I've already answered the point I'm question is why it looked like a hasik fo matter
(1:24:11) off yeah yeah you're you're you're right just evolving into like like a criticism
(1:24:17) of John's sexual choices it is criticism of of John and it's a criticism of what
(1:24:23) John thinks we're in argument Alex did you think in the argument that we were GNA swap candy with each other or we
(1:24:29) were GNA guard
(1:24:34) so this this is over uh you guys are not moving anywhere on it I'm gonna move the
(1:24:41) next thing to the next point I'm gonna let Zen chapiro fill the next question in order to send us Z I want to stay on
(1:24:48) this [ __ ] what do you mean like did did you sacrifice it and it
(1:24:53) goes back to the other team appex what is the next point you want to go to no okay there we go let get back on Walling
(1:24:59) get stilling for the other team here bro okay one second Alex then the this
(1:25:06) the problem is this in you got you guys are saying the same thing over and over again no no not no no not you not you
(1:25:14) Andrew you're not saying the I get it you're making a point but they're not engaging with that point so we're not
(1:25:20) going anywhere on this we engaged the whole time no no well no not really because the logical conclusion didn't
(1:25:27) follow from what your answer to what a woman is it's just more begging the question it's just more begging the
(1:25:33) question it makes no sick gu it's it's devolving into but this is not a de wait this is not a de Evolution it gets right
(1:25:39) to the art of what we're saying Al I play this game and why it's not a game
(1:25:46) it down like your personal life and be like well Andrew uh are you up Myer Alex you already brought up
(1:25:54) my personal sexual preferences in order to call me a hypocrite at the beginning of the debate you have
(1:26:01) no you have no ground to stand on for this it was directly relevant to the and
(1:26:06) is this Alex and I shown it time i' already defended this a 100 times they answer your question what defs a woman
(1:26:13) by definition is not relevant here because you're just going to twist it to say that us IR relevant when you're talk
(1:26:18) about attracting women you have to be able to Define women yes
(1:26:27) you're not gonna move Alex I'm forcing you to fill another question to bring us into the next area of this debate I'm
(1:26:33) forcing you to do that I'm asserting this is your channel my bad that's rude I would please like it if you filled
(1:26:39) another question to send us to the next Point go well I want to get back to the initial topic that we're supposed to discuss because we're an hour and a half
(1:26:45) in and we've barely covered it so I want to go back to that so I want to go back to uh actually Zen's opening statement
(1:26:50) because I think now we're going to get into the actual debate uh so I have an issue with what Zen said in his opening statement uh he said he proved uh
(1:26:58) basically that you know uh that having prematal sex was inconsistent with my value system but that's not true because
(1:27:05) my value system was straw manned so I guess I'm wondering will you acknowledge that in the previous debate you kind of
(1:27:11) stman my value system or did explore that so the reason I say that is because
(1:27:16) you claim not to be a consequentialist or that you don't reason things from an
(1:27:22) outcomes based stand of morality you say there's there's something other than like you you would say even if it would
(1:27:29) save 10 million people you wouldn't you wouldn't cheat on your girlfriend whatever um because that's against your
(1:27:35) values but there's no way for you to actually assert your values or invoke
(1:27:41) them in a debate uh because there's nothing grounding them so I don't I don't so I don't think I'm STW maning
(1:27:48) you when I only appeal to consequences because that's really the only thing you can invoke in a debate that wouldn't
(1:27:53) just fall back to like I have a mental state that says this is good like what who cares no but the problem with that is
(1:28:00) I'm not a pure consequentialist like for example how do you ground the non-consequential aspect of your morality because it goes against my
(1:28:07) personal values which is what uh depends on which thing we're talking about if we're saying like hypothetically
(1:28:13) speaking if I could whatever r word a girl and uh it there would be no
(1:28:19) consequences and it actually set her on a positive personal development Journey that significantly improved your life
(1:28:25) would I think it was justified the answer would still be no well yeah what the problem is I don't think that uh the
(1:28:32) consequence the only thing to define whether something is right or wrong I think the inherent action also uh is bad
(1:28:39) question yeah yeah you have to have it yeah you have to have an answer for the the grounding like why why would it be
(1:28:45) inherently wrong to do certain things uh because they're not in line with my value system right okay so then we were
(1:28:51) correct and it's the consequence of things that go against your your own personal subjective value system no no
(1:28:58) he just well not only that then to be to be clear Alex what I'm saying like even if you say it's not outcomes based when
(1:29:04) you say it goes against my values that's what I said it's it's just a mental
(1:29:09) state that you have that says this thing is bad but in a in a debate you can't just
(1:29:16) invoke like I have this mental state well I don't have your mental state you can't you can't make an appeal to that
(1:29:24) just not argument I should stop tell you where I stand on every single issue but my value system is personal to me and my
(1:29:30) little experiences that's the problem your value say the problem your value has to around religion right no because
(1:29:38) because when we invoke when if we are to invoke a Christian moral standard we're
(1:29:43) not invoking that just in virtue of like our mental state we're invoking that Universal every G that's true Everything
(1:29:51) has presuppositions including that supposition you just made pre you just made a presupposition
(1:29:58) John about our presupposition everything's presupposition AR again why do you not believe in Santa Claus zero
(1:30:05) proof why do I not believe in God zero proof and a million other reasons okay you can't say that yours is absolute
(1:30:10) because you read it in some book we're not and we're not we not saying that ours is absolute we're doing an inter
(1:30:16) our value systems yours came from some that you believe is a magic guy in the sky yeah no one's denying that though
(1:30:22) John we're saying that in the internal critique ours is consistent yours is not
(1:30:27) I disagree this I've already tried by asking you what a woman is and prove
(1:30:32) that you be inal critique that you're inconsistent
(1:30:37) SP oh see see your style is very obvious you do the same thing every [ __ ] argument and I'm gonna make a right up
(1:30:43) after and make a video showing exactly how shitty you're hold up coat streams yeah that's what they are but yeah
(1:30:50) what's not again this is this is devolving G logic and reason let's one one second gentlemen Alex how how I
(1:30:57) think your initial question put us here do you want to move to another question or do you think this is now off topic
(1:31:03) again well I think it is getting off topic we're going back to the same topic as last time which is John's [ __ ]
(1:31:09) sexual preferences or whatever or his definition of woman yeah moderator here
(1:31:14) I want I want to keep it no I mean let's give credit to Pedro he's making the best that he can but I want to get back
(1:31:19) to uh the the actual initial argument which is about having Prem marital sex like let's let's get through that and
(1:31:26) then we can move on to the next thing we have time uh okay so I'd like so I want
(1:31:31) to go back to so okay so maybe then so I'm not stranding you maybe you can restate for me your arguments why you
(1:31:38) think premarital sex is bad so the reason Andrew and I take
(1:31:44) premarital sex to be bad is because it doesn't conform to the Christian worldview which we hold to dogmatically
(1:31:51) okay um but but for the purposes purpose of the debate uh the two of us are
(1:31:57) willing to again like we did last time enter into your world view and um
(1:32:03) determine that it's either good or bad by your metrics um and from what we can
(1:32:10) gather the only real empirical metric you can use would be things like
(1:32:15) happiness um you know substance abuse uh economic Prosperity all of which are
(1:32:22) better within when when people are within the confines of marriage all of which are worse when people engage in
(1:32:27) casual promiscuous sex when they have you know when they engage in porn use
(1:32:32) when they are homosexual all these things are worse when they do when they
(1:32:38) engage in your guys's lifestyle and better when they engage in our lifestyle so that's generally the argument okay
(1:32:45) well it's not an internal critique if I don't believe in one of the premises and the premise I don't believe in is that
(1:32:51) you should just do uh purely what makes you happy but you do believe that you
(1:32:56) said that multiple times in our last debate you said you don't have a duty to society you have a duty to do what makes you happy you said that many times we
(1:33:03) could check the but let me let me get involved to racist I'll respond just let
(1:33:08) him respond Pedro I always say this as long as you're not directly harming other people and doesn't go against your
(1:33:16) values that's that's if your values are entirely arbitrary it's like and if you if you take I mean this is what the what
(1:33:23) woman take what if I take a different definition of what harm is and I say
(1:33:29) that murdering or you know harming okay murdering or beating children to death
(1:33:35) uh is not considered harm in my worldview because I have a different definition this is why definitions are
(1:33:41) important that way we don't play a semantic now synopis values are
(1:33:46) arbitrary my values are based on my on my uh I guess lived experiences and the
(1:33:51) things I can see and observe your values are based on a book right yeah 2y old book yeah yeah yeah turn it is I'm just
(1:34:00) just it's just Tire it's just a tired like Remar we've heard a thousand times I mean I mean I don't understand person
(1:34:07) and Talking Dude would it be better would it be better if our values came from a 300y old book or 200y old book
(1:34:13) like nii for instance wait for n don't your values come from nii mine don't no M why wait John's do I
(1:34:22) create my own values and you guys have it speak what nii you said right they're granted from nii and that's a hundredy
(1:34:29) old no I didn't I didn't say that okay let's let's let's forget about Nishi why is it that when I base my values around
(1:34:36) things that I can see and observe and your values are based on the Bible why are mine arbitrary and yours are
(1:34:44) not okay so again are are you trying to invoke that our that our worldview is
(1:34:50) arbitrary is that what you're trying to do yeah both of no AR arbitrary would imply and correct me if I'm wrong
(1:34:57) arbitrary would imply that it's just based on a personal whim like the the entire standard the entire basis for
(1:35:03) what you believe is based on personal whim ultimately right no let me let me
(1:35:09) respond they just play Fancy games here man look at a kid with Santa Claus I'm I know I'm I'm just trying to make sure we
(1:35:14) understand what the word arbitrary means is that is that what you mean AR Santa Claus arbitrary no they're talk we are we
(1:35:22) you're talk excuse very research them because it came from a black you accept the definition I just
(1:35:27) gave of arbitrary John your CO's back let let me just answer their question so I just starty to play games in every
(1:35:34) question it's fine but let me just answer this question so uh I just looked up the uh Oxford def uh definition of
(1:35:40) arbitrary so let's just go off that based on a random choice or personal win rather than any reason right so I would
(1:35:48) based on random random chance whim you who cares it's a wrong choice of word
(1:35:53) right yeah maybe not the best however I would argue the Bible is
(1:35:59) not based in reason okay then argue it well that's
(1:36:04) hold on that's a whole separate claim yeah let first let's first get Common Ground no wait he said he would argue
(1:36:11) the Bible's not based in reason Alex then argue it it was written by a dude
(1:36:17) like 2000 years ago which dude what was his name how is that relevant well well you said because you made the CL but
(1:36:24) people dude there was many people that contributed to the B so then it wasn't an a dude then how many dudes yeah like
(1:36:30) what dudes relevant awesome idea wait you made the affirmative claim and I just put it to
(1:36:36) the question and now you're saying I'm derailing it so what do you want us to see can we ever challenge a pame what
(1:36:42) can what are we allowed to do pH based on science and reason I think it's based
(1:36:48) on reason and I that there's it contradicts physics guys
(1:36:54) do okay nobody's ever walked on water no virgin's ever given birth it's all nonsense do you think well I mean so how
(1:37:01) do you know nobody's ever walked on water it defies the laws of physics so
(1:37:08) know that with part of real SE they were just capitalizing on tectonic plat stop reading and then they [ __ ] can you give
(1:37:13) me wait John uh can you do me a favor just like Humor Me Close Your Eyes for a
(1:37:19) second real quick I'm I'm serious close your eyes for a second I'll do it first CL your eyes no I need you to do it so I
(1:37:26) know you're not Googling [ __ ] close my eyes can okay can can you give me a single law of
(1:37:31) physics just one have you seen anyone walk on water do you know and you give me a single law
(1:37:38) of physics that uh we are defying you give me a single law John I'm saying
(1:37:44) Miracles don't give me a law of physics John what do you mean well you just you
(1:37:51) just said the Bible defies laws of physics and you don't visit yeah guys calm down calm
(1:37:58) down so here's here's the argument just fly in its face you guys brought up the
(1:38:03) Bible you said it defied the laws of physics Andrew's now asking for a law of physics so we can
(1:38:10) tested that's that's there is now build the majority John doesn't matter what everybody agrees with can you give me a
(1:38:17) single law of physics one one just say no John Rob yeah no you
(1:38:24) it's 100% relevant when you invoke the laws of C Alex let me interact with you the
(1:38:31) reason why they're doing that is because you brought up those two things you brought up the Bible and you brought up laws of physics then to examine that Ste
(1:38:41) selected let me speak to Alex real quick so I know I'm not going off Bas here I need to make sure I'm not being gas lit
(1:38:47) Alex do you see why they went down that line of questioning yes they're trying to they're trying to establish why logic
(1:38:53) is faulty and I can I can but the the problem where this is Dev is we're getting stuck on one word that John said
(1:38:59) law physics okay let's rephrase it that was the Crux of his argument okay sorry go ahead Miracles this was ini Miracles
(1:39:07) okay those things don't happen Okay let me let me explain like this well I mean but wait John wait John
(1:39:13) when I asked you why such and such isn't true with the Bible you said because it's against the laws of physics when I
(1:39:19) ask the name wait wait I'm done when I ask you and you say I don't know a single law of
(1:39:26) physics why should I believe wait why should I now believe you that anything in the Bible's against the law of
(1:39:32) physics if you don't know any of the laws John see these guys play games Pedro I don't know if you're fly
(1:39:38) with thenen and Andrew don't talk okay J I'm gonna engage with you what what's happening tell me what's happening these
(1:39:46) guys do it's very obvious okay why they think they're good at De bers they use lot ofes and they twist things with
(1:39:52) apple and oranges and they pick on little definitions and try to corny you and it's very [ __ ] lame it's like a
(1:39:57) little kid try okay Alex before you speak I need to engage with John real quick these are horrible John John
(1:40:04) neither Zen nor Andrew I'm I took notes on the side right here neither of them
(1:40:10) brought up the laws of physics or the Bible none of neither of them did that it was your side of the debate team that
(1:40:17) did that and then they start investigating that everyone laun stre should say they've never seen a miracle happen and they would think that's that
(1:40:23) probably com out laws do you know that they've never seen a law wa John how do you know that
(1:40:31) no Andrew stop John stop Alex what were you saying go can I have the floor because every time I go down line of
(1:40:37) questioning it devolves into Andrew and John ARG so I'd like to like stay on this uh for like at least five minutes
(1:40:42) and then we can go back to whatever they want to do okay I'm just gonna clarify this for JN and clean it up a little bit
(1:40:49) I think if one person uses one word out of context it doesn't derail the whole argument so what John is saying is
(1:40:55) there's a lot of things in the Bible that are unscientific like a virgin giving birth unscientific someone
(1:41:02) walking on water unscientific whether he can or cannot name a law of physics is
(1:41:07) totally irrelevant what he's trying to say is that it's unscientific and I will stand by that as well that's what AR
(1:41:15) resp well well wait wait hang on hang on are you now making the claim that
(1:41:20) Miracles are unscientific yeah okay great can you tell me the scientific method
(1:41:27) John okay you guys believe that can you tell me the scientific method John won't
(1:41:33) [ __ ] bulldoze me right so you can't tell me the scientific method either well well stop stop stop once again stop
(1:41:41) John okay Alex cleaned up the language Alex cleaned up the language honestly he did and now you guys are saying it's
(1:41:49) science it's unscientific think it's fair think it's entirely fair for the other team now to
(1:41:55) ask for okay what is a scientific method so that we can stay in line with that
(1:42:00) explain let me we answer it I will answer it okay thank you for all of
(1:42:06) recorded human history we have a track record of a man impregnating a woman and nine months the scientific method who
(1:42:13) gives us
(1:42:21) rumance yes ah Andrew stop let Alex Alex finish that statement okay whether John
(1:42:28) knows every single definition or knows zero definitions again is a relevant to the actual argument so try focus on the
(1:42:33) actual argument instead of trying to catch him on little definitions that he doesn't know hang on hang on hang on
(1:42:38) hang on hang on for all of human recorded history we have observed that
(1:42:44) the way babies come into this world is a man ejaculates into a woman and
(1:42:49) approximately nine months later she gives birth that is in line with every single thing that we have observed
(1:42:55) through our censes the idea of a woman giving birth without that ejaculation
(1:43:01) has never been done in human history thus it is unscientific the sci how do you know Malex you are alive scientific
(1:43:07) method is totally irrelevant to the point oh
(1:43:14) okay here Alex I see your frustration because I also in debate that's n's game
(1:43:21) exactly I hate playing the death definitions Dame thing that's happening when in your warp I'll give his answer
(1:43:28) the science part let me just speak for uninterrupted for just a sec okay go John you that wine can be turned into
(1:43:34) blood right or sorry what is it wine what that's CR she
(1:43:42) okay wait it's a what it's a it's a what the consecration when they Chang the wine into blood Jesus's AR wait wait
(1:43:49) what's it called again consecration okay I okay go ahead do you believe that the
(1:43:57) wine is actually turning into Jesus's blood uh yes we do okay so you can test
(1:44:03) scientifically for the presence of hemoglobin before and after in the wine and everything we know about blood
(1:44:09) there's no traces of anything related to blood whatsoever it's still just wine well that's the well I mean how how
(1:44:14) would you know that you don't even know what the method for science is how would you know that we could test for anything you can okay but now you now you just
(1:44:20) want to throw science out the window I'm F by all the I'm not throwing it out the window John gentlemen gentlemen
(1:44:26) gentlemen pause really quick just pause Alex let me show you something really quick you need to examine this and I
(1:44:32) swear to God I'm not lying to you and I'm not trying to be biased at all it's the truth okay he John just tried to say
(1:44:39) that water into blood is called consecration when in fact in our
(1:44:45) worldview the Christian world view it's called transubstantiation that's the actual
(1:44:51) word for it he just described something where making the land where a church is built to be the land of God and where
(1:44:57) his people gather that's con con consecration so this is why so really
(1:45:03) quick this is why definitions matter because honestly as a debater what John
(1:45:09) just said if I were to look at the dictionary that does not contort with actual reality there the point so this
(1:45:16) is why definitions matter I'm just saying I'm not saying the definitions don't matter but I'm saying that John's
(1:45:22) recollection of definitions is not B por to this actual argument not Rob arum
(1:45:27) whatsoever weot say press to sh button hang on let all go I'm gonna make it
(1:45:33) some f I'd like to be able to speak uh okay fine let's just let's just assume that John was wrong about that one
(1:45:38) statement totally relevant okay let's take something much more simpler okay uh the Bible argues that the Earth is I
(1:45:44) believe 8,000 years old or 10,000 years old let's just say let's just say uh let's just say for the for for accuracy
(1:45:51) Point let's just say I believe it's 6,400 years exactly just for the just for the sake of this argument go ahead
(1:45:57) we have fossil records uh again that in scientists overwhelmingly agree on the
(1:46:03) earth is actually something like I don't know like [ __ ] over a billion years old basically it's really [ __ ] open
(1:46:09) way older than this now whether I know exactly how old it is is it relevant to the argument well I'm what I'm saying is
(1:46:15) that a lot of the stuff that the Bible argues for are not grounded in science and are you saying you disagree with
(1:46:21) that simple statement well hard to disagree if you can't tell us what science is it's our it's our best
(1:46:28) understanding of empirical things at the current time and it changes when anomalies accumulate they adapt and
(1:46:34) there's a paradigm shift but it's our best empirical account of what's going on in the world okay hang up so hang on if that's
(1:46:41) true if science is just something that shifts based on empiricism is that what you're saying you think science is that
(1:46:49) doesn't mean that we don't have a reliable definition of how things are and we can't IND principles of how things okay great I just want you to
(1:46:55) give me that definition so I can operate off of it inside your worldview okay so what is
(1:47:02) it it is our best basically the thing it's inducing the principles that make
(1:47:08) that fit the data that we have the most at the time okay so but we can Define what's in blood in all blood that we've
(1:47:14) measured and we can okay measure wine before and after the [ __ ] magic trick
(1:47:19) and after it's the same it's not turning into blood we can find that okay we've never to to date seen anyone give uh
(1:47:27) birth as a virgin or part water or well it doesn't follow that that's never happened okay let's let's just quickly
(1:47:34) followly unlikely that it's happened so it's it's all we're on the same page and everyone always agree on this recogition
(1:47:40) the intellectual practical activity encompassing a systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical
(1:47:46) natural world through observation experiment I agree to this definition do you guys agree does everyone agree sure
(1:47:53) okay cool then should be good to agree with forward yeah well I mean now we're to discuss it yeah the thing is like
(1:48:00) what you guys are objecting to the same critique can be made like when you say
(1:48:06) we've never observed um you know a b a virgin birth therefore it's extremely
(1:48:11) unlikely and I'm GNA hold to that it has hasn't happened but you guys both invoked Evolution at at either in this
(1:48:17) debate or prior but we've never observed organic life being created from inorganic compounds therefore it's
(1:48:24) extremely unlikely so why don't you hold to that that's never happened yeah apple I mean are you are
(1:48:30) you arguing how is this apples to that was called a [ __ ] kill shot but neither oh Mar contradiction I can
(1:48:37) answer it or you hold on it's contradicting all existing empirical evidence if I said Santa comes out a
(1:48:44) chimney then give me that seen that happen where contradicts all empirical evidence okay well wait you say it SP
(1:48:50) well wait you say it contradicts all empirical evidence I just want to make sure I got this clear you think it
(1:48:55) contradicts all empirical evidence that we have never seen life come from in
(1:49:00) organic life really we can explain that through processes what okay so tell me the
(1:49:07) process read uh the blind watchmaker by Richard Dawkins he painfully goes through how slight mutations R tons
(1:49:15) Dawkins what would you like to discuss what would you like to discuss on Dawkins with the Single Cell organizer what would you like actually an N okay
(1:49:22) does this bring it back Prem premarital I mean how how can
(1:49:29) we after Andrew hang on I'd like to ask this question I've asked it several times I haven't gotten an answer to it I
(1:49:35) would like a clear answer to this question and then we can the conversation can stem from there uh most of the people that the religious people
(1:49:42) that I know I've talked to they say that religion is based on a leap of Fai that's an appeal to majority what's your
(1:49:49) what's your claim I'm hang on I'm asking you are you do are you saying that it's
(1:49:54) actually religion is based in science and logic well it's definitely based in logic and reason yes and the science
(1:50:01) science is just supplementary to it it's just a faculty that we use to describe yeah science is a logical process so do
(1:50:08) you do you think that uh like uh religion does not contradict science at
(1:50:13) all uh it depends on the religion your religion the Christian
(1:50:18) well no no the Christian Christians basically invented science so no I don't think I don't think
(1:50:24) so we use it as a metric based tool just like you guys do except we actually know
(1:50:30) what the process for it is okay so for example the uh turning water into wine
(1:50:36) you you don't think that contradicts signs that's a metaphysical conceptual metaphysical conceptualization you said
(1:50:42) literally it literally changes that's what Christians believe it it does literally change let me ask you a
(1:50:47) question uh no stop right there you have to explain that okay I'm I'm trying any
(1:50:54) mect it's wine before and after how did it literally change to blood let me ask you a question can you that I'm trying
(1:51:01) to well I'm trying to can I ask you a question well because the question entails the answer I'm not begging the
(1:51:07) question I'm just trying to explain to you how this operates you say that we can test the wine before uh it's
(1:51:14) ingested by a human being how many times do you think the wine has been ingested uh and then they've tested it I'm just
(1:51:21) be ingested well well wait that's part of the process how do you know that it doesn't turn to blood after it's
(1:51:28) ingested you could still measure it and can you show me any of the empiricism
(1:51:34) doing that and we could imagine a study where that could easily be proven well we could imagine it but this is your
(1:51:40) claim that it never can so I'm asking you if you can show me the empir I'm the person making the claim
(1:51:47) you're making claims that have enough claim you're being Len
(1:51:53) again yeah no I need to respond what John just said please um again philosophy Major John we're you should
(1:52:00) know that we're both making Co positive claims about the proposition that the water has been turned into wine or that
(1:52:05) the wine has been turned into blood Etc we are affirming the positive yes and you are you are affirming its negation
(1:52:12) so we're both making positive affirmations you're just negate you're you're affirming in the negation so the
(1:52:19) burden is on both of us there's no there's no neutral ground no it's ped can I hold something yeah yeah John
(1:52:26) John let let your partner get in Alex go for it time and time again so when I start asking questions for some reason
(1:52:32) it always goes into either Andrew or Zen asking John questions and I just can never get through a set of questions
(1:52:38) like it's because your lines of questioning suck
(1:52:44) well answer all your questions as I can Alex ask him can you just at least address those questions to me
(1:52:49) temporarily and then you could go John okay there we go it just keeps derailing yeah and for the and for the sake of it
(1:52:55) John not that we're pulling you out just suspend yourself for a second and let Alex handle as much Poss I just want to
(1:53:00) get through a line of questioning okay I want to explore where you stand on this because you you have a very interesting Viewpoint that I think is uncommon uh
(1:53:07) for religious people so let's explore uh okay so you're you think that for example turning water into wine is in
(1:53:15) line with sence uh well I don't it depends on how
(1:53:21) how you gauge the metric uh can you expand on that please yeah so
(1:53:26) it depends are we using empiricism how are we gauging this exactly yeah we're using
(1:53:31) empiricism okay so then if we're using empiricism I'm not familiar with the
(1:53:36) data can you show me where the wine stays wine post ingestion well it's not let's let's
(1:53:42) let's forget about ingestion let's just talk about uh some water that's in a class that's being turned well it would
(1:53:47) be wine that would be in the glass it can be water whatever cup a cup water is
(1:53:53) in the cup no Wine's in the cup you know how dumb this conversation is so be watching fine wine is in the cup we turn
(1:53:59) it into water other way doesn't matter no we don't turn it into water they turn into Jesus yeah yeah hang on hang on you
(1:54:05) guys are misunderstanding so Alex is asking about Jesus turning water into wine and I think Andrew's interpreting
(1:54:11) it to be when you drink the communion wine and it be dude follow I'm sorry maybe we were
(1:54:18) talking pasty to talking about the miracle of Christ are any of the statements in the Bible I
(1:54:24) do want you to correct me so as far as I understand in the Bible it says that Jesus turns water into wi is that
(1:54:29) correct right that's that's correct I'm not so can you explain to me how
(1:54:35) scientifically that would happen oh most certainly all wine is uh converted using
(1:54:40) water just so you know scientifically every drop of wine you've
(1:54:45) ever drunk was converted from water just play games fermentation but that's wor
(1:54:51) fer well that's true there's additional qualifiers if you're asking me from a miraculous standpoint how that's done I
(1:54:58) how one person would do it without fermentation well I have no idea okay do
(1:55:03) you think that this could be replicated I have I well as far as the miracle goes yeah I think that it's
(1:55:11) possible yes so do do you think you for example will be able to replicate no
(1:55:16) okay who do you think would be able to replicate I have no idea no one do you think do you think a group of like
(1:55:21) really smart scientists would be able to replicate it I mean I don't replicate it in with you mean the miracle itself yeah
(1:55:28) just taking water and turning into one uh I I doubt it okay so do you think do
(1:55:34) you Alex do you think a real quick do you think a bunch of really smart scientists could form a organic compound
(1:55:40) out of inorganic compound we already address that potentially potentially in the future
(1:55:45) but not now there's no there's no reason to believe that they could because we've always we've failed every single time we've ever tried it that doesn't mean
(1:55:53) that it is not in accordance with science for life to exist
(1:55:59) right uh just because we don't we don't have a technological breakthrough where we can do something 50 years ago the
(1:56:05) idea of us doing this live stream would have been inconceivable but wouldn't have that was that was no it wouldn't
(1:56:11) have been inconceivable 50 years ago 100 years ago Andrew we gotta call it time out on this this is off the rails
(1:56:20) again John ask John what it what's the timeout for go for it I mean this can be summed up in in
(1:56:27) one point like I can come up with an infinite number of things that have never happened and put it on them and say hey show me that it's never happened
(1:56:33) I I think it could happen it's just a dumb argument I mean have we ever scientifically seen something come from
(1:56:39) nothing because that's what you guys believe there are theories that whether there didn't need to be a first cause or
(1:56:45) anything coming from anything there could have been matter always exists yeah I know everyone of up very spale
(1:56:50) I'm sorry just I I'm gonna have to Stonewall this point then because you're both the whole time yeah yeah I know I
(1:56:58) know I'm sorry Zen Alec for it yeah okay let's take something else then uh okay
(1:57:03) true or not Jesus was able to paron water right that's that's true he was a may it was a m yeah Moses was able to
(1:57:11) part water yeah that was tectonic plates they found out the the real reason why that happened it was tectonic Place ears
(1:57:17) it was a scientific explanation Saudi let me finish please uh okay you you
(1:57:22) guys believe that in the Christian Bible like this is part of your belief yeah okay yep do you think that is
(1:57:28) scientific I could be like do you do you think that's something that like a group of scientists could replicate
(1:57:34) potentially possibly but why do you think it's never been done it has been done I mean we
(1:57:41) parted water tons tons of time it I'm going to try to be as charitable as I can be okay with the with the
(1:57:47) leading question right uh so you're asking me why do you think that a group of scientists could perform a miracle I
(1:57:55) I I don't [ __ ] know I maybe like I don't I don't I don't know but maybe
(1:58:00) they can perform a miracle if they if they have enough faith and uh that you know they're imbued I have I have no
(1:58:06) idea you're talking about you're talking about the realm of metaphysical at this point I have no idea how to even address
(1:58:12) that but but like n was Alex I have to be fair I have to St all this point we
(1:58:18) can't get back at the miracle Zen what's a question you have for the other team can I just make one do you do you object
(1:58:25) in principle to things being um irreplicable by
(1:58:30) science do I object in principle to things being a replicable can can you explain that no if something if
(1:58:37) something cannot be replicated by science do you object to it in principle no no no okay then then your
(1:58:44) objection is invalid by your own lights here let me
(1:58:52) it go I will be concise to be to to clarify the point here you're objecting to Moses parting the Red Sea Jesus
(1:58:58) turning water into wine drinking the the W the wine and it becoming blood um you're objecting to all of those things
(1:59:04) because we can't replicate them through science that's your only objection but you say you don't object to that
(1:59:10) in that's that's that's that's what I'm objecting them too they're unsen mean they can't be replicated by
(1:59:17) science that's what you're saying but you don't object to that in principle they go against special pleading this is is called special pleading they go they
(1:59:23) go against like every single thing that we can observe through our censes no yeah because we it's a very long period
(1:59:31) of run even though wait a second you ever observed someone parting water which is totally different than [ __ ]
(1:59:38) who's we we unu wait wait clearly many people saw that so who's we you who are
(1:59:46) the these guys know watch 2000 years ago you don't know any of these people you don't know anything about well I mean
(1:59:51) but the thing is is that when you say this Collective we I don't know who you're addressing who's we every single
(1:59:57) person that will return game well these aren't word games these are this is
(2:00:07) important new I want I need you to tell me John how am I allowed to challenge
(2:00:12) your claims what's the appropriate way to challenge any of your claims am I even allowed to or do I just need to sit
(2:00:17) here you can question anything as long as you don't [ __ ] fight dirty which you've been doing the whole time am I fighting dirty tell me how to challenge
(2:00:24) your claim tell me way okay let me explain for the audience but I can't be interrupted this time because it's
(2:00:29) always gets blocked off okay you guys are the ones claiming that all these things have happened that
(2:00:35) nobody's seen and Zen's counterargument is that well don't you agree there's things that science hasn't figured out
(2:00:41) yet yes of course but that doesn't mean that we can come up with infinite possibilities of things that contradict
(2:00:47) all the best information we have empirically now to say that those things you know have any kind of probability of
(2:00:53) of happening in the past I can create an infinite number of claims I can say I climbed a golden Mountain yesterday and
(2:00:58) an angel in the dream yesterday told me to do such and such you can't verify those things those are metaphysical
(2:01:03) claims and you can claim that something came from nothing and you can't verify that I already explained that one yeah
(2:01:10) but this is but this is the whole problem right is it's becoming circular no it's not a problem it's not we're
(2:01:17) grounded in reality you're grounded in FA wait what what is grounded wait wait how do you know what reality is to
(2:01:23) ground yourself in it John that's a good question all we can go off of is what we can induce based on what it's not all we
(2:01:29) can beyond that we can come up with an infinite number of things that we can believe in that have no basis whatsoever
(2:01:35) where did you come up with the idea that that's all we can go off of okay again this is can you guys you guys this all
(2:01:43) into and to pick up Artistry and premarital sex being good or bad yeah
(2:01:48) how do we pull that back in John can you answer that c can I answer Zen and
(2:01:54) Andrew's question I can pull it back and explain it very three go for Alex okay
(2:01:59) fine let's take something like a virgin giving birth we have a whole bunch of
(2:02:06) empirical evidence where we've seen women give birth right where we've seen we have a whole track record woman giv
(2:02:12) birth and every single time the way it's worked is that a man ejaculates inside a woman oh that's a lie that's a lie so
(2:02:20) alexop don't don't cut him off just yet I need to see where he pulls this all back to premarital sex good and pickup
(2:02:27) Artistry good keep going Alex well I was I was just going to bring it back to the religion because I was gonna answer their point because they're basically
(2:02:33) using well you guys can't prove uh Evolution so therefore that I wish shouldn't have to prove our thing so
(2:02:38) that's what I'm trying to say that's why I'm trying to use something different I'm trying to use uh well Al giving
(2:02:44) birth hang I'd like to finish my point thank you uh so okay so we have a whole
(2:02:50) bunch of data that shows that the way a woman gives birth is when a guy ejaculates inside of generally speaking
(2:02:57) I know there's been like some [ __ ] eggs that have been fermented blah blah are they still virgins in gen hang on
(2:03:03) generally speaking that's how it works you're making a claim of the opposite you're saying that well actually the way
(2:03:09) a woman can also give birth is through a miracle without the man ejaculating inside the woman and I don't know how
(2:03:16) you can say that scientific because it goes against every single thing that we observe throughout human history but it
(2:03:21) doesn't I don't even know what you're talking about let me ask question who you're talking about well wait I need to I need to understand this if a woman is
(2:03:28) a virgin and is artificially inseminated can she get pregnant exceptions don't make the rule I'm gonna ask you one more
(2:03:35) time Al in the game again well why I don't know why I just do you know how to
(2:03:41) say the word yes is the word [ __ ] yes impossible for you to say who yes yes
(2:03:46) course but there was no artificial in semination back then on Earth that again that's another claim
(2:03:52) that's another claim right there's no artificial insemination back then how do you know there was no artificial
(2:03:58) insemination back how do you know that it how do you know they didn't have a ceramic base like all these things guys
(2:04:05) really quick how does now this all relate back to premarital sex good or
(2:04:10) bad pickup Artistry good or bad bring I need to I need to say this the
(2:04:17) the point that we're getting at the point that I would like to hammer here is that the critiques that you guys are
(2:04:23) applying to us apply to you guys as well and what you believe in dog critiques that we actually apply to
(2:04:30) you guys do not apply to our worldview we're we're so we consistent in we consistent in ours you guys are not
(2:04:36) consistent in yours everything you guys are are critiquing our world you for the same critiques apply to you oh you can't
(2:04:42) see virin Vero you can't see a biogenesis oh you can't you can't see water to wine you can't see something
(2:04:49) from nothing hold on we're talking about probability though conne you understand how low the
(2:04:55) probability is for 100 Amino chains to develop in one sequence and turn into
(2:05:00) what we deem to be a an organic compound it's like one in a trillion zeros dude
(2:05:05) we talk about probabilities you're talking about rolling the dice seven 50 billion times in a row that's how un
(2:05:11) unlikely your world view that what rest of that okay I'm using a different example to counter your point we're
(2:05:18) talking about the uh Virgin Mary uh giving birth right when need D VRE is
(2:05:24) kind of going to artificial insemination route which is interesting I know I wasn't I was just simply I was just
(2:05:29) simply telling you that you were incorrect In what were saying that virginity can be intact with pregnancy
(2:05:35) by your own metric that's again you're trying to like tax me on like a little technicality you understand there not
(2:05:41) Technic these are important physiques man you're not being good faith right now be good F you understand the point
(2:05:47) I'm getting maybe you don't but I'm assuming you're smart enough to understand the point I'm getting at and the the point I'm getting at is the idea
(2:05:53) of a virgin giving birth is goes against every single empir empirical thing that
(2:05:58) we've observed throughout human history this is the so so Alex to respond to that this is my whole problem though
(2:06:04) this is my whole problem with this right is that when you say things like virgins
(2:06:10) can't give birth right ability when you say things like this right I it's
(2:06:16) appropriate for me to challenge these things within the metric of your worldview would you agree that that's
(2:06:23) true except but exceptions don't make the rule Ure okay why W you why do you
(2:06:29) just refuse to how was that a loaded question too no it wasn't a loaded question okay so then can you just say
(2:06:35) yes it's okay for you to challenge it but it's pointless to this discussion yeah I gu if you can technically
(2:06:41) challenge it but again if you can prove to me an exception I agree with you that yes we these things there in
(2:06:49) never we challenge these things we come up with the proper definition that both of us agree to then we can get to the
(2:06:55) next part if I disagree from an EMP when you make a claim from an empirical
(2:07:02) standpoint isn't it true X my answer is no it's not true X but if if you say
(2:07:08) okay let me refine that thought what about what about if we def Define this a different way and narrow it a bit then I
(2:07:14) can speak to that this is debating is done yeah John John needs to get in John
(2:07:19) needs to get in John go for it okay Andrew red Dawkins Richard Dawkins has a whole chapter devoted to precisely what
(2:07:25) we're going back and forth which book uh the blind watchmaker he said I don't
(2:07:30) know if I read blind watchmaker he said that it refutes creationism or so he
(2:07:36) says um basically he like in that book he says a rock statue can move it has a
(2:07:41) probability of moving right it's just very very very low yep so like what you guys are contesting is is the
(2:07:48) possibility just in theory that someone could have given a virgin birth okay but you're not looking at the fact that it
(2:07:54) defies all empirical science and therefore has incredibly low probability actually zero close to
(2:08:01) zero okay so let me answer to your critique we're not talking about can you imagine like in one one moment gentlemen
(2:08:08) gentlemen one moment let me let me ask this to make an observation both of you agreed to a definition called science
(2:08:15) that Alex brought up earlier and both of your worldviews are saying yes there are things that science cannot replicate but
(2:08:21) we both in fact say happened for John and Alex it's matter coming into reality
(2:08:27) out of nothing for Zen and Andrew it's uh the Water to Wine well no it's the
(2:08:33) same it's the same thing it's matter coming into reality but that aside just let me let me answer to this critique
(2:08:39) because I think it's a fair critique I've often said that there's a there is a probability that somebody could jump
(2:08:45) off of a building turn into a balloon and Float off you would agree that that's true right yeah just the
(2:08:51) probability is like extremely low we would both agree that that's true yeah you're banking on these extreme unlikely
(2:08:57) scenarios well a statue moving is not an extreme unlikely scenario that you brought up it is okay well then why why
(2:09:04) is my critique suddenly out of bounds when that was your example because that that was my point
(2:09:11) saying that anything can happen you guys are saying yeah and I String to your point okay but that means everything in
(2:09:18) an infinite matter could could have happened know I finished my point I was just agreeing with you in principle that
(2:09:25) it is true that you can have these kind of infantism possibilities but still say
(2:09:30) that they're possibilities but they become so absurd as to be rejected can we agree that that's
(2:09:36) true based on our framework of metaphysics and the nature of truth and reality yes okay so if we can agree to
(2:09:43) that and I think we both sides can suddenly we're coming to a place where
(2:09:49) we can have an actual debate why is is that so [ __ ] problematic I don't I don't get that it's not okay continue
(2:09:56) okay great so let's talk about probability then your critique of us is
(2:10:02) uh creationism and the the the world's age and this type of thing we're
(2:10:07) prepared to have that debate if that's the debate that you guys want to have absolutely uh happy to do so if we're
(2:10:15) just going to go off of mathematical probability we're happy to do it if
(2:10:20) that's how we're going to Define find that okay okay so do you want to do that
(2:10:25) then I mean I think we should again like this is learning into a completely different debate I think we should keep it on topic uh okay yeah this whole
(2:10:32) thing started because I was making the point that uh I think uh religion is on scientific okay you guys think it is
(2:10:39) scientific that's interesting not many people claim that but okay we can move on from that that's fine we can return back to the initial wait that wasn't our
(2:10:46) no that wasn't our claim no no Andrew don't interrupt just see his next question go back in we have to we just
(2:10:52) have to correct we're saying we're saying that science is in accordance with religion and with our religion and
(2:10:57) that it doesn't contradict it that's what we're saying okay but anyway let's not dive
(2:11:04) back into that that is a fair defense let's not dive back into it okay couldn't disagree with that more but okay well we can we can move on uh let's
(2:11:11) let's go let's get back into s of the initial discussion because we keep going off track was about uh uh what's it
(2:11:18) called uh premarital sex good premal sex bad pratal sex good prematal sex bad okay uh
(2:11:26) so what are your Arguments for why it's bad aside from religion uh oh crap dude I was literally about to Thump A Bible
(2:11:32) in your face and you threw me off [ __ ] man I don't know what to say now so I'll I'll dive in sorry about that our
(2:11:38) arguments against it one more time are that based on the empirical metrics that you guys would measure the outcomes of
(2:11:46) promiscuous sex are far worse than the outcomes of men who get married on
(2:11:51) average on aggregate right just on average this is the
(2:11:57) case wait would either of you disagree with that claim well as a have divorce rates I need to explor I need to explore
(2:12:04) what is that based on this would be based on empirical data which I assume
(2:12:09) you guys would accept well what's the data you have to tell me what it is well I would have to provide that for you do
(2:12:16) you do you want me to take a moment and pull up yeah or you can just you can just sum it up and I'll take your word for it okay so the summarization is that
(2:12:23) almost every single threshold that you would probably consider to be a positive which means two parent households would
(2:12:29) would produce children for instance that have less drug abuse uh they have uh better outcomes they even have higher
(2:12:35) IQs due to nourishment almost every single definitive metric that you can come up with is Superior in a twers
(2:12:43) household with a mom and a dad promiscuous sex well wait promiscuous
(2:12:48) sex is going to significant increase the likelihood of single motherhood there's
(2:12:54) no doubt that that's true that's aund I mean just on just on the average of x amount of women you sleep with uh the
(2:13:01) chances significantly increase that you're going to get one pregnant there's no D there's just no doubt that this is
(2:13:06) true unless you guys want to say that that's not true well uh for me it's not
(2:13:11) of a sure most people why you get of a SE and it's not true uh well okay but
(2:13:17) it's true for most people yeah and and when I when I make when I make these arguments Bas averages do you think I
(2:13:24) mean most people uh I don't knowa well yes he
(2:13:30) answered yes he does answered yes so so we are talking about most people thank you Alex so do you have an argument
(2:13:37) against what I'm saying because John affirmed that all these outcomes are better the chances do increase if you
(2:13:44) have promiscuous sex and we're talking about the outcomes for society okay uh
(2:13:49) yeah I do so we're to clarify a little bit I'll promise you I'm not doctoring uh so this is based on the study that I
(2:13:55) think you B up on the first debate that suggest that married people are happier what about if your goal is not have kids
(2:14:02) like what what if you're not trying to have kids what you say well well I would say if your goal is not to have children
(2:14:09) uh you might have something there but the problem that you have is on average
(2:14:15) most people do want to have children so once again uh I think that the argument
(2:14:20) kind of Falls flat right but could I just argue that my channel was designed for people who were not trying to have
(2:14:26) children well how do you know you never really know anything like
(2:14:32) this extreme skepticism is not going to work well I'm not I'm not that's not even extreme skepticism if you just make
(2:14:37) the affirmative claim this is what I'm doing this is what most people in the channel believe I'm just asking how you know that that's well I wasn't actually
(2:14:44) making that statement I was just asking a hypothetical what if I'm not saying I'm not making that claim okay so
(2:14:49) hypothetically what if most people on your channel didn't believe that and they only wanted to not ever have
(2:14:55) children and that's why they're following your advice did I get that right yeah okay well then I guess in
(2:15:01) that case uh I would say I don't know I I may not say anything to it but I just
(2:15:08) reject the claim as being absurd okay because then you would have no no moral issue with it uh no I would still have a
(2:15:15) moral issue with it I just wouldn't at least within your framework I would consider it consistent that's all okay
(2:15:21) can I make sure I'm understanding correctly just repeating it back to you what you I think you said no like not responding yet just to
(2:15:27) make sure I'm following the point you're making so you're saying that by people having uh multiple sex partners that's
(2:15:33) going to increase the likelihood of single motherhood well not just single motherhood it'll increase the likelihood
(2:15:39) of STDs it'll increase the likelihood of all sorts of negative
(2:15:45) outcomes I think I think I mean you guys would agree un undeniably because you'll probably get around STDs with like I
(2:15:51) don't know condoms and like be careful and stuff and like they're treatable but you guys would agree undeniably that
(2:15:57) divorce is a bad outcome right it's bad sure yeah right for whatever for
(2:16:03) whatever your reason is every every study ever conducted affirms that the
(2:16:09) lowest uh divorce rate is among among those who have had um zero sexual
(2:16:15) partners before divorce so those who remain virgins or up to Mar those who remain virgins up until marriage are the
(2:16:22) least likely to divorce out of any other we're not going to find another partner
(2:16:27) what's that so that's because they're scared they're not going to find another partner in this reason it doesn't matter
(2:16:33) though you you agree that the metric like whatever your cope response is you agree that the metric of divorce is bad
(2:16:40) and remaining a virgin up and marriage is the least likely to end in divorce so
(2:16:45) by your metric that would be good okay let me use your guys back as a response
(2:16:50) most people that are waiting till marriage are religious and most people that get married that are religious don't want to get divorced because
(2:16:57) they'll be going to hell and that's the most severe party you're the man John I love you
(2:17:03) John you're the greatest ever that's our whole point our whole point is that you
(2:17:09) agree with us that the metrics via Christianity are going to produce better outcomes for people by every single
(2:17:16) observable and empirical metric that you can possibly come up with I reject that well then tell me the empirical metric
(2:17:22) that you reject which outcome do you think's not Superior okay sure I I okay I don't
(2:17:29) believe this this this is what it comes down to I don't believe that it is your job as individual to do what is best for
(2:17:37) the whole which is why that's not what I asked you I asked you what empirical metric do you think is what let it
(2:17:44) finish and then and then refute it yeah go for it my response which is why I personally never joined the military or
(2:17:50) anything like that or I don't really volunteer much anyway by what metric I think it comes down to what makes you
(2:17:56) happy as a person now I trust hang on but why is that a good metric hang on you said earlier it's not about personal
(2:18:02) happiness by the way I just want to remind you your could up just like C
(2:18:07) statements let him finish yeah okay I think as a person you should do what
(2:18:13) makes you happy as long as it's in line with your values right so uh I think that there's absolutely nothing wrong
(2:18:19) with having premarital sex if that's what makes you happy if marriage is what makes you happy then by all means get married but I trust the
(2:18:26) people who watch my channel to have some level of self-awareness and to understand what they want from their
(2:18:32) life so that that's a that's that's a difference I treat them as adults who are capable of deciding what's best for
(2:18:38) themselves and I give them the tool to do that now by what what exactly is your question by what metric is that well so
(2:18:44) no my question to you multiple times was if by every empirical metric which in
(2:18:50) this case I think uh the empirical metric would basically be self-reporting there's really no other way that you
(2:18:56) could gather that data I don't think I don't think anyway maybe there has been targeted studies on that uh but even
(2:19:03) from self-reported data that's at least somewhat reliable as a metric all of
(2:19:09) these metrics are superior for people who wait we know that the divorce rates weigh down for people who stay virgins
(2:19:14) for instance we know that they're going to stay married a lot longer we know that if you're a Christian you're less likely to get divorced we went over
(2:19:20) those stats before by every by every single metric the outcomes for the
(2:19:26) people are better your response to this is those statistics don't take into account all the people that are fearing
(2:19:31) hell that are staying together yeah but I'm not convinced what John's trying to say and what I'm trying to say doesn't
(2:19:36) matter what they fear what looking at the outcome hang on I'm not convinced
(2:19:41) that that's a causation instead of a correlation you'd have to prove to me well that's a causation thing yeah so
(2:19:47) Alex said but that's fair enough but I just need you to understand that everything you can source as a causation
(2:19:54) is going to be a correlation everything literally no you can show me data that's
(2:19:59) is correlator all that is correlator especially in especially in your in your materialist worldview like somebody
(2:20:06) could punch somebody else in the face and you could say that the bruise on their cheek is just correlator to the
(2:20:12) fist not actually caus maybe this bad IB or really not this this is exactly what
(2:20:18) what John brought up earlier would just you statistically being able to move right we're saying that all all truth
(2:20:26) claims that you make that are scientific are going to be correlator when it when it comes to this type of data Gap if
(2:20:32) you're saying that the current argument that doesn't imply correlation is well let's Alex get in Alex get in there what
(2:20:39) when they when they look at like something uh meditation scientifically proven to increase your overall wellbeing when they look at stuff like
(2:20:45) that they basically uh measure the person's uh brain uh activity before and
(2:20:50) after like certain meditation sessions yeah that is a direct causation no that
(2:20:56) so that's a correlation they're saying we correlate this thing happening here with what your self-report is we don't
(2:21:03) know still for sure that that's causation we just assume that it's causation you're really well I'm not
(2:21:10) this is not semantics if the argument is you could mathematically jump off of a a
(2:21:16) building turn into a balloon and Float off it's just that the you know the certainty of that is so infantes that
(2:21:21) it'll probably never happen everything that you're talking about in this instance is going to be correlator it's
(2:21:29) just that you say we believe that the percentage is high enough that we can take that as being fact yeah being
(2:21:35) statistically significant okay so then look wait Alex so that's true if that's
(2:21:40) true then you can't just rub this off as being correlator if I can show you that
(2:21:45) the percentage is high enough that you should probably take it as fact right well you have to control for other
(2:21:51) factors they well that's what a study does they control those when they do when they do studies they're like
(2:21:57) scientific they control for all external factors so you'd have to tell me that we took two groups of people right like 100
(2:22:04) guys and 100 100 guys who come from every single metric being the same uh
(2:22:10) they both had like I don't know a body count of 10 they got married and some didn't that the guys who had a 10 body
(2:22:16) count uh who got married were an average happier like you'd have to show me something like like that so that I know
(2:22:22) it's not quite but you already have that I don't well wait wait what do you mean you don't so so then you don't agree
(2:22:30) wait you don't agree with us then that when we're just talking about averages that we don't know the rates of people
(2:22:37) who are self-identified as Christians and devout uh that they're they're not self-reporting that they're getting
(2:22:43) divorced less than people who are or who don't identify as Christian is that what you're saying to me no I'm I'm just
(2:22:49) saying I don't think it's actually the uh the fact that they have uh that they they've uh abstained from sex before
(2:22:56) marriage that's I think it is well I'm I'm about to answer that okay I don't think it's the fact that they have abstained from sex before marriage
(2:23:02) that's causing them to be less likely to get divorced I think it's more of the fact that uh they hold religious beliefs
(2:23:08) and they don't want to be shamed by their community and blah blah blah that's causing them not to get it worse so I think this is a case of correlation
(2:23:14) rather than causation so so wait if they do have the sex before marriage you're say you're assuming that all these bad
(2:23:21) things are going to happen to them right getting shamed by the community all this type of thing right no I'm assuming if
(2:23:26) they're going to get divorced they're going to get shamed by their Community okay so well then I don't understand
(2:23:32) let's go back to the argument you're saying in your argument you don't believe it's them not having the sex
(2:23:38) before marriage right why and why are they not having the sex before marriage I'm
(2:23:44) saying I don't know but it seems like it's a what why do you what do you think why do you think they're not having the sex
(2:23:50) before marriage answer let him uninterrupted any number of things maybe they can't
(2:23:56) get laid maybe they're religious I don't know man could be any you don't you don't think that it would be direct in
(2:24:02) correlation with their religious values telling them not to have sex before marriage even if they identify that
(2:24:08) that's the reason they're not doing that um it could be that could be the fact that they just couldn't get
(2:24:13) late so so we're just prop we're g to dismiss what well wait so you want to
(2:24:20) miss the empirical evidence you do have no first of all it's the empirical evidence that you brought to the table
(2:24:26) I'm just saying if you want me to accept this empirical evidence you have to show to me that all external factors have
(2:24:32) been controled for and you haven't done that otherwise there's CH phones well there's there's no way to control for
(2:24:37) every single externalized Factor you can only do things like you guys would consider a
(2:24:43) metaanalysis I have been told the highest form of scientific evidence right so if we were to show you
(2:24:50) if we were to show you these types of studies uh that have a meta analysis would you accept them then uh let me let
(2:24:58) me feel no no let me feel this one I would say no they did a they did a famous meta analysis hold on let me respond I have a really good point here
(2:25:04) they did a famous meta analysis was on CNN where they said supplements increase all all cause mortality by 5 per. and if
(2:25:10) you look at the actual studies there's like 50 different studies the do ships were either too low to not have effect
(2:25:17) or they were too high to the point where they were toxic all this tugies and BL people that were already really stick
(2:25:22) some of the studies had like one person in the sample size they cherry-pick studies to get this nice headline that
(2:25:28) supplements cause disease which is beneficial to the pharmaceutical companies who profit off people being
(2:25:33) sick and that was a meta analysis That was supposed to so wait so we can reject
(2:25:38) metaanalysis then it depends on the specific studies with okay so then we
(2:25:43) can't then we can't object to meta analysis then you can or can't depending on the sub studies beneath it okay but I
(2:25:50) here here can I can I just point to what's that trying to make a
(2:25:56) simp for external we're gonna I would just wanted to point to some some correlation that
(2:26:03) is so strong that it's undeniable okay so this study that I'm referencing they they they took samples
(2:26:11) from the 70s 80s 90s 2000s and 2010s the number of women in this study who had
(2:26:19) zero sexual partners was around 20% in the 70s and it's around 5% in the 2010s
(2:26:25) which sounds accurate right and the number of churchgoers in this study uh
(2:26:32) was found that the the lower the number of sexual partners prior to marriage the higher the the percentage of churchgoers
(2:26:39) it was so we've got our correlation between low sex partners High church goers and we can also look at our
(2:26:46) divorce rates which have gone up in the past 40 50 years as we've gotten less um virgin
(2:26:54) marriages and we've gotten more sexual promiscuity which you guys are advocating
(2:27:01) for okay I responded to you on yeah let let John go for a while go for John it
(2:27:07) basically just goes back to Alex's point about confounds is like I know a lot of Christian people I know a lot of people that are in Christian marriages that
(2:27:13) don't get divorced because they don't want to go to hell it's like the ultimate punishment who cares they don't want to do it it's for I don't want to
(2:27:21) murder somebody because I don't want to go to jail like it doesn't matter why I don't want to do it it just matters at I don't like we can John I hope you don't
(2:27:27) take this person but we can use your family like you've told me that your parents are miserable but the reason they're together is because they're
(2:27:32) religious is that correct yeah I mean that's pretty personal but okay sorry I felt like it
(2:27:39) was really appropriate I didn't mean to go there they both waited we can use them an example they both waited till marriage to have sex they were each
(2:27:45) other's first partner I was the first child so I might have been the the 32nd Blaze of Glory there for the first time
(2:27:50) ever and I've Avenged my father now no but no in all seriousness uh you know
(2:27:57) they've had their trials tribulations they're closer now but for a lot of the period they didn't want to go to hell
(2:28:02) and that was what and they didn't want to you know they didn't want to violate the church that's a very strong
(2:28:10) job I know what you're thinking for fin says hang on go see
(2:28:16) here Pedro I got to finish this John did your mom did your mom stay at home with you yes okay wasn't that
(2:28:24) nice I was verbally abused pretty hardcore so maybe maybe not so much well wouldn't you say on average that would
(2:28:30) probably be pretty nice for people I don't know you don't think so you don't
(2:28:35) know it depends on all we of the M man I mean so here's the thing I know we're
(2:28:42) talking anecdotally but I'm fine talking anecdotally I don't believe you when you say to me you don't know uh most people
(2:28:51) would probably most children would probably do pretty well having their mom stay at home and raise them you really
(2:28:56) think that they wouldn't do well or better no proba I can concede that probably yes yeah so if you can concede
(2:29:02) that and the probability is good then your parents staying together for religious purposes and having your mom
(2:29:08) stay at home to raise you at least potentially on average would have produced normally a much better outcome
(2:29:14) for you and maybe it even did compared to what might have happened if your parents had split uh to non you know
(2:29:21) because they said screw Christianity and split up you would agree that the outcome for you was as arent for
(2:29:27) marriage in general this is bring it back to my family for example my parents uh you know were really great but they
(2:29:33) were miserable together and they stayed together for a very long time now that they're separated they're both a lot happier did your mom stay at home with
(2:29:39) you no she worked she worked so I mean in that instance um it's it's a it's in
(2:29:46) some ways it can even be counterproductive I I do concede that that's true but generally speaking Alex
(2:29:51) wouldn't you concede to my point that generally speaking if your mom had stayed at home with you the outcome for
(2:29:58) you probably would have been even better than it is right now yeah I'll consider see that but that's because my mom is
(2:30:04) really nice and friendly and so this is what and so this is what we we Advocate this is what we're advocating for and
(2:30:10) you guys kind of just concede that these are true it though EX for marriage is Am I
(2:30:17) Wrong argument I mean the marriage produces the foundation for the husband
(2:30:23) to work and the mom stay at home you would agree that that's true right but we're off about two different friend Andrew and what we're making you're
(2:30:29) making an argument for marriage you know you agree making an argument you made an argument earlier for why divorce is bad
(2:30:35) I'm saying that divorce is not always bad sometimes divorce is good well we don't we don't say that divorce is always bad even if we got rid of no faal
(2:30:41) divorce which we advocate for we would still want to put in Provisions for women who are being abused horribly or
(2:30:48) horrifically and by the way just so guys know those Provisions have always been in place you could always get divorced
(2:30:55) you just had to provide grounds for being divorced that's all that's all we advocate for is that you have proper
(2:31:01) grounds otherwise what happens right now you realize which which sex do you guys think initiates the most amount of
(2:31:07) divorces yeah obviously women everyone knows obviously women right and and at the college level it's like 90% or
(2:31:13) something absurd so what we want to do is even the playing field a bit and say if you're going to get a divorce come to
(2:31:19) the the court and have an actual reason for the divorce other than I want to go blow my neighbor right yeah I'm not I'm
(2:31:26) not opposed to that I think all five of us on the screen would agree with that right go going back to what I was saying
(2:31:31) earlier the problem is when you make blanket statements when you say things like oh well you know uh marriage makes
(2:31:38) people happier therefore uh you guys are we dra because it's not a blanket statement because we're just if we say
(2:31:44) on average and you agree on average then there's no blanket there we're just we're agreeing to the terms of average
(2:31:51) outcomes we that's it we're we we have no other metric to go by other than
(2:31:56) average outcomes and then intuition and intuitive reasoning the intuitive reasoning matches up with what we see
(2:32:03) with outcomes so why wouldn't we believe it's true well first of all I'm not convinced that on average uh marriage PE
(2:32:09) uh makes people happier I I I will acknowledge that in the study I'm just going to take it in good faith that you
(2:32:15) know you're telling it like it is that there's some kind of correlation there but I don't know if that's a causation there meaning I don't know if it's
(2:32:21) actually getting married that makes you happier or the kind of people that want to get married also have other things
(2:32:27) going for them already been through this like been through this D can he let him finish let him finish
(2:32:35) and then refute it yeah just let me finish bro and then you can refute me uh that there's other factors that are
(2:32:41) going for these people that are making them happy like maybe all these people have very stable jobs then are into drug use or whatever and that's what's
(2:32:47) actually creating them happiness is it's correlation marries yeah that's that's all that's all correlated and we're
(2:32:52) we're accounting for the correlation saying that being married actually reduces those harm factors you're
(2:32:58) talking about okay okay before you respond John we're gonna start wrapping it up because it's been two hours and 30
(2:33:04) minutes and I know Zen and Andrew are running on Eastern Standard Time so it's like 12: or 1 amm in the morning where
(2:33:10) they are and they got work tomorrow so we we'll let you get the what last word on this and John no responses no
(2:33:17) responses John gets the last word and then we're going to go to Alex for closing statements oh yeah I had in my notes uh
(2:33:25) what their defense is about church molesting kids all the all the molestation and and all that nonsense
(2:33:30) and the crusades have caused more deaths than all the wars combined I'd love to answer to both of those points Petro
(2:33:37) let's let them answer because I think this is I'll answer to the first one yeah we obviously disavow Church
(2:33:44) pedophilia um but same could be brought the same critique could be brought tenfold to
(2:33:50) the public school system where act there the public school system uh has probably
(2:33:56) the highest predatory rate that you could possibly imagine and the reason for that I think both I think both of
(2:34:02) you guys would probably agree well what because Predators go where children are you would agree with
(2:34:09) that right yeah yeah that's not you guys are supposed to be the holiest of people on Earth and and in touch with God and
(2:34:16) to I'm sorry I'm sorry since most people self-identify as being being Christian don't you think that most people in
(2:34:21) public schools are Christians uh I mean there's a term
(2:34:28) versus how people are living their lives most people not I agree right I agree so since we can agree that that's true we
(2:34:34) would say that those people how they identify and how they're living their life are two completely different things
(2:34:41) and we completely disavow those people consider them scum want them run out of the church want nothing to do with them
(2:34:47) but we're also not Catholics so that you understand and John the way that you were brought up it's those people doing
(2:34:52) all the kid didling just so you know not our people we're not doing the kid you
(2:34:57) clarify what you guys are so we're so Andrew is an orthodox I
(2:35:02) mean I guess I'm an orthodox Inquirer I don't know if you would call me a cumin or whatever but we're Orthodox Christians okay
(2:35:10) um Mary Mary had sex with her her uh brothers or something what is it what is
(2:35:16) it the for no idea no idea what you're talking but that would be blasphemy to the theot
(2:35:22) toos just so you know so no no absolutely we believe in an Ever Virgin Mary not not to derail but um yeah
(2:35:30) Orthodoxy is distinct from what you deem to be called Catholicism Roman
(2:35:35) Catholicism um who were the ones that actually enacted the Crusades which you mentioned that doesn't apply to us
(2:35:40) either okay so okay fair enough oh yes this is ding off from
(2:35:47) premarital again but quick John to correct you um I don't remember if it was Cain or Abel but God made one of
(2:35:53) them a wife I can't remember precisely which one it was but he he created a wife PR of nothing contrary to the
(2:35:59) surface level belief God made more people than just Adam and
(2:36:05) Eve Pedro can I have maybe like two minutes just to go through Rapid Fire and some things and we'll just go real
(2:36:12) like so yeah I have a feeling it won't be rapid fire but do we get
(2:36:17) rap it's a yes no and then sure go ahead you can do that to me okay so I just
(2:36:24) very quickly as we were talking uh pulled up uh I just typed in uh study sex effect on happiness and basically
(2:36:31) there study that people have sex more frequently report a greater sense of General happiness now assuming that you
(2:36:36) guys would agree with me that you shouldn't marry someone just for sex correct uh yeah we would agree that you
(2:36:43) should not get married just for sex absolutely we agree on that so if the end goal if we're going off like my
(2:36:49) metrics and my value system where the end goal is happiness which there's some preconditions to that then wouldn't that
(2:36:56) study just directly contradict that if people who have sex you'd have to tell us what the preconditions were well the
(2:37:01) preconditions is that you're not directly harming anyone else we we reject that as a prec condition but uh
(2:37:08) well I'm just gonna I'm just gonna go with the Merit of it though and just try to answer as honestly as I
(2:37:14) can okay so if we're following like we're operating in my world view uh and
(2:37:20) we're doing this internal critique uh then wouldn't it make sense that if I'm going off this study that I should want
(2:37:28) people to have uh sex because that's what makes them happy it if everything
(2:37:33) that you're saying within it would be accurate and I had no line of inquiry and took it all at face value then we
(2:37:40) would just agree that it was consistent sure okay so then the only argument you
(2:37:45) would have is that it goes against your person values I I would just quickly argue that when you when you if you're
(2:37:52) invoking a study that says people who have more sex are happier um I would retort with the fact that people that
(2:37:58) are married have more sex was first of all that doesn't that
(2:38:05) doesn't apply to a lot of married couple but but with that aside but Alex but with with that aside we
(2:38:12) agreed that people shouldn't just get married to have sex yeah we agree we do agree with that yeah we agree with that
(2:38:18) so you don't want to marry we believe so so that we're clear we believe that the criteria for marriage first and foremost
(2:38:25) should be uh the children you you should be getting married specifically for the best outcomes for your children and that
(2:38:32) is our deontological duty so we don't look at it from a consequentialist worldview we look at it from a duty
(2:38:38) based worldview we think your duty first comes to your children and then your spouse right well it's actually God
(2:38:45) children spouse right that's uh that's the duty order in which we joh three people so the children are I would I I
(2:38:52) would probably agree with that I think that's a pretty fair logic and philosophy but okay so let me just walk
(2:38:58) through this one more time and I'll move on so we agree that you should not marry just to have sex yeah but we also if we
(2:39:05) take the study of face value that uh marriage I mean sorry that sex increases
(2:39:10) happiness then following my uh whatever ultr ogical perspective it would make
(2:39:15) sense that I would argue that people should have sex it could unless unless there was externalized
(2:39:22) values where you would look at it and say okay these other things mitigate the fact that just pure Hedonism and sex is
(2:39:29) good and that the these other outcomes are better explain that okay so like for
(2:39:36) instance you go okay sex is good so therefore having sex is good okay because people report like a higher
(2:39:42) happiness index but what if they report a higher happiness index than that if they're married and having sex shouldn't
(2:39:49) we go with the being married and having sex at that point well what if they can't find someone to marry yet well I
(2:39:55) mean these are all great questions and this is why we we couldn't take it at face value we'd have to go through it
(2:40:01) line by line to figure out it one if it's logical and if it adds up and if it's empirical and all this [ __ ] so I
(2:40:08) mean at face I would say if all of it added up to being completely equal to what you're saying sure we would say
(2:40:15) you're consistent we just reject it because we don't think you are going to end up being consistent
(2:40:22) syst okay I don't know how you can make that something that you don't think I'm going to end up being well because
(2:40:27) because we already told you there's there's got to be a hundred different factors that go into this and we've
(2:40:33) named tons and tons of them right you're talking about uh uh you're talking about
(2:40:38) ex uh external factors right yeah that's exactly how I felt about your
(2:40:44) study okay yeah but you didn't Point any of them out well because I never saw the study
(2:40:50) so oh oh right so if that's true that how can you external factors for the problem it's
(2:40:58) pointed out potential ones like I pointed out potential ones that probably do apply maybe okay fair enough I just
(2:41:05) can't say that definitively yes okay fine I'll I'll I'll end it off on this
(2:41:10) last question I'm not trying to personally attack you but you talk a lot about uh setting a good personal example
(2:41:16) right uh you know and that's kind of like where you think the pi Community fails is we set a bad example I mean
(2:41:22) that was why you spent no no not not really so I I just want to correct that
(2:41:27) it's not that you're setting a bad example it's that I believe that you're espousing out of one side of your face
(2:41:33) what you claim you're doing and out of the other side of your face you're doing something else that you're not claiming
(2:41:39) you're doing what am I well I think this is why we would go back to my definition
(2:41:44) that you guys agree to you guys think that you're instilling men with confidence in order to approach women
(2:41:51) and giving them just the tools in order to uh do that we believe that you're
(2:41:56) actually espousing ways for men to have sex with multiple women and that you're
(2:42:02) actually encouraging them to do that so it's not that you're it's not an example setting situation as much as we're
(2:42:09) saying that uh what you practice and then what you actually preach is
(2:42:15) different than what you claim you actually preach oh okay so you think it's not just that I'm we're setting a
(2:42:22) bad example by [ __ ] a lot of girls you're saying we're actually directly teaching that you should [ __ ] a lot of
(2:42:28) girls yes yes yes that's what I'm saying I'm agnostic with that though I
(2:42:35) don't he established that you say that but hang on well this is a very
(2:42:40) interesting claim that we we're getting into like 200 40 minutes into now so I guess we have to W dude we have to wrap
(2:42:46) it up man it's [ __ ] I mean I just where your evidence for that is like do you have any videos of mine that you can reference we can do it round four if you
(2:42:53) yeah I mean we we I do I I think I would hold you guys to this this is what I would say we you guys should pin it here
(2:43:01) and then come back for part four if you because just say we don't actually do
(2:43:07) closing statements we just say for now hey we've reached a good point we know where we are let's hold here and let's
(2:43:13) come back and jump off from this point and now some back solo even if you this is the this the other problem I think
(2:43:20) I've seen here get we restarted the conversation in part two and part three and each time we had a whole lot of
(2:43:27) things that never actually related to or maybe they did on some level to the base
(2:43:32) Topic at you do have to get to those super chats though before we wrap up well no we look can we get I mean we get
(2:43:38) two minute closings right we gotta get we gotta get some closers here yeah we gotta get some something yeah they get
(2:43:44) everybody else you gotta give everybody an you know a send off right what the closing statement go
(2:43:51) ahead there two minutes I mean make them quar I think that's you can KCK it off then okay um yeah so where do I even
(2:43:59) begin well you guys heard it um we we were operating obviously from
(2:44:04) different worldviews I think what the biggest takeaway though um is that we
(2:44:10) were able to step into the worldview of Alex and John here show why it didn't work on multiple on from multiple angles
(2:44:19) um including the fact that um lower sexual partners are less likely to
(2:44:24) divorce which they seem to be you know divorce being a bad thing um that the
(2:44:31) the less likely you or the lower your sexual partners are the more likely you are to be a churchgoer which would then
(2:44:36) result in a lower divorce rate which again are good things that derive from our worldview and that higher casual
(2:44:45) promiscuous sex more sexual partners um leads to all the negative outcomes and they are advocating for higher um rates
(2:44:53) of casual promiscuous sex and that it's cool and that these are good things but they've got no ultimate grounding for it
(2:44:58) other than Alex's mental state um other than John's you know philosophical mental state that they're unable to
(2:45:04) actually articulate uh and what we can what we can observe and I I think I
(2:45:11) delivered multiple killing blows here um by by hammering this and emphasizing
(2:45:17) this that their critiques that they delivered to us also applied to them and
(2:45:23) where they whether they were valid or not doesn't matter because they also applied to them when they say that um
(2:45:30) the Christian worldview is wrong because we've never seen a virgin birth well I could say that the evolutionary worldview is wrong because we've never
(2:45:36) seen organic compound come from inorganic compound so um all of their critiques are you know self-refuting by
(2:45:44) their own lights uh and they and all of our critiques to them
(2:45:49) are consistent with our worldview and they don't actually violate our worldview um so I I think um you know I
(2:45:56) think we we did as good of a job as we can there's obviously still more ground to cover I do appreciate you guys um
(2:46:03) debating I always appreciate somebody who's willing to come into the ring especially against me me and Andrew here we are some of the fiercest right-wing
(2:46:11) Debaters on the internet if I you know had to say so myself from my biased perspective um so in anyway if you guys
(2:46:18) enjoyed uh my name is Zen Shapiro uh you can find me on Twitter and YouTube also the in-house right-wing debater on The
(2:46:24) Crucible where I debate often uh so if you enjoyed me and the debate you can find me there so um I appreciate you
(2:46:31) guys tuning in I appreciate you guys having us on cool awesome thank you that closing statement I'll move it over to
(2:46:37) Andrew for his closing statement okay let's let's not interrupt either I wanted to interject there but I I kept my mouth shut let's all give each other
(2:46:43) courtesy to make the closing remark yeah so first and foremost John I I know that uh in the the intro and then kind of our
(2:46:50) sparring back and forth that you took that personally maybe that has something to do with something external going on I
(2:46:57) don't know uh I think that uh when we got into the trans
(2:47:02) portion of this thing that's but it's not a shame of that yeah yeah well this was not I just what I needed you to know
(2:47:08) is that this was not designed to be a personal attack but rather to challenge what you're espousing and what people
(2:47:15) are believing versus what might be factual that's the point of debate we got into multiple different things where
(2:47:22) I challenged you on on physical on physics and laws of physics on science
(2:47:27) and on the scientific method on these various things that you had no answer to though these were your criticisms
(2:47:32) towards us which to me that was totally bizarre and made no sense you may you
(2:47:38) Levy a criticism at somebody and you don't even understand the actual methods
(2:47:43) or processes in which you're levying the criticism that makes me think you're just parting things that you've heard
(2:47:48) it's absurd to me on its face Zen did make the most valid criticism which is
(2:47:55) that all of the things levied against us are levied against you I was trying to get as Ultra good faith as I could and
(2:48:01) answer yes no and just you know that but anytime I would ask you one of those questions I was straight up stonewalled
(2:48:08) said it was non analogous we don't have to answer that we're not going to engage with that and then the metric for which
(2:48:15) you kind of said that that was okay is because you were concerned about the audience's Judgment uh which leads me to
(2:48:22) believe well I mean you have to have a smart audience if they don't you know what I mean if they just can just be
(2:48:28) swayed by these perceived nonse and straw man arguments or or loaded
(2:48:35) arguments as you say I don't think my audience could be swayed that way so I I
(2:48:41) think that all of them were good faith arguments all of them were designed to probe your worldview so that we could
(2:48:46) dive into it more we were happy to answer criticisms to our own just as usual they tend to fall flat so that's
(2:48:54) kind of my closing statement Zen did great and you can find him on The
(2:48:59) Crucible uh he is our in in-house right-wing debater you can find me there too though I'm usually hosting not
(2:49:05) debating I would like to thank uh Alex and John for turning out for the debate
(2:49:11) thank you all right thank you for that Andrew and just an intermittent Super Chat from John Smith on playing with fires channel
(2:49:18) for $5 thank you for that Super Chat Sir John and Alex just show how to get girls
(2:49:24) in 2022 not what you should actually do but yeah obviously a girl with a lower
(2:49:30) lay count I think he's mini body count there is a better partner and I'm gonna pass it over to
(2:49:36) John for his closing statement okay so I just have to say
(2:49:41) that I was uh fairly disappointed I felt like this was a dirty fight the whole way from the other team it was a lot of
(2:49:48) I'm going to make a response while dissected it'll waste much time but there was a lot of apples and oranges there was a lot of logical fallacies
(2:49:53) there was a lot of loaded questions they picked extreme skepticism they played games with definitions and they made a
(2:50:00) lot of wrong assumptions followed by deductive points which is why I kept calling time out because no I don't
(2:50:06) think the audience is clever enough to follow the little games you were playing that can defeat my position unfairly so
(2:50:13) if this happens again we there's going to be some strict rules regarding the types of point that can be made and I'm
(2:50:20) going to continue to speak up we can't be reframed as being afraid to answer points when they're when you're doing
(2:50:26) low blows below the belt in a ring you're not going to [ __ ] kick people in the nuts that's what it was like the
(2:50:31) whole the whole time we were on here and for the record I don't think we're the crazy one saying Miracles are insane
(2:50:37) okay it's for the same reason we don't believe in Santa Claus or the Troth fairy anymore I look at Jesus Christ on
(2:50:43) the same exact level no different whatsoever okay same with all the other religions so I don't see them as binding
(2:50:49) threats and I don't think people should live their lives in fear of going to a place down below that we now know as
(2:50:55) magma okay we didn't know that before or going to a place above that we used to think was heaven but now we know that's
(2:51:00) the solar system okay a lot of these claims are outdated and now science destroys them and once people learn
(2:51:07) enough about science it's very easy to be an atheist okay before evolution in modern Neuroscience it was it was a lot
(2:51:12) tougher but now we have real explanations for these things and if you're going to try to claim that we just can't tell that it's blood once
(2:51:19) you've drank the wine and it's it's probably blood anyone with half a brain is going to say no you're [ __ ] okay
(2:51:25) and that's how it so I just want to stress we have to make this a fair fight
(2:51:30) and we're not the ones uh making the wild claims here that's you guys got it thank you for that uh John
(2:51:38) uh intermittent Super Chat from our channel on The Crucible for 100 Mexican pesos which is would be computed out to
(2:51:46) $5 uh over here 26 cents 26 Cents yeah inflation inflation
(2:51:52) page Emmanuel trying to fill up that gas tank let me teach you some expert
(2:51:58) hammering techniques and by showing you how to build insecure but very
(2:52:03) affordable and comfortable treeh houses you decide how to use those techniques
(2:52:08) do you see any problem that's a question but you don't have to answer it thank you for your Super Chat sir and we're
(2:52:14) pass it on for Alex the leader and creator of playing with fire guys
(2:52:19) remember to like share and subscribe to his channel sir give us your closing statements sure so I'll start off by
(2:52:25) thanking everyone uh thank you Pedro thank you Zen thank you Andrew thank you John uh it became a [ __ ] show at times
(2:52:33) but uh I appreciate you guys coming on uh so okay so with that being said let me get into my closing statement um I'm
(2:52:40) com gonna comment on what Zen and Andrew said I think uh you attempted to step into a worldview that is true but I
(2:52:46) don't think you really did an example Zen gab when just because Evolution has never been recreated it debunks an
(2:52:52) argument that's not true because millions of birth have taken place in recent history and aside from artificial
(2:52:57) insemination none of them involved a virgin giving birth so again we're comparing apples to oranges I think that
(2:53:03) was done a lot throughout the debate and we have to compare apples to apples I think also the fact that you were having
(2:53:08) sex before marriage and now are virtually signaling that you shouldn't take away from uh that does take away
(2:53:14) from your credibility I also think the definition game takes away from the argument at hand I think it adds to
(2:53:19) discussion you made the argument near the end that I'm inconsistent between what I say I teach and what I really teach and that's interesting I'd be
(2:53:25) curious to hear you prove that in the next debate because that is something that was only brought up at the very very very end and I could not
(2:53:32) fundamentally disagree with that more because you're effectively calling me a hypocrite so or at the very least saying I'm inconsistent so I'll be very curious
(2:53:38) to uh to hear you respond to that on my overall assessment of the situation is
(2:53:43) you guys are better Debaters but our arguments are a lot better might you sense awesome and guys that was the
(2:53:50) closing savings for this debate it will probably more than likely have a part four it was very good at the end like
(2:53:56) Alex said I fully agree at times it was a definite [ __ ] show but usually in the later half of these things I've been
(2:54:01) noticing it comes back home and gets more productive so hopefully next time you we come back and we see you guys we
(2:54:07) can pin it from here and un like resume like unpen it right here um thank you so much Alex for letting us on your channel
(2:54:14) we appreciate it um at this time I don't know if Andrew and Zen want to leave but I definitely I Alex I saw last time you

(2:54:27) minutes to do like a post show type of thing gotcha Okay cool so yeah guys all right well I'm out I gotta go um [ __ ] my
