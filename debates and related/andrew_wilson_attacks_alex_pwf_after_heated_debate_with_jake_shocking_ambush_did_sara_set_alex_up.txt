(1:24) because I just want to know I just want to know a couple things I just want to know a couple things so the first thing
(1:30) I want to know can we talk can we talk about the drunk driving stats when you were talking about drunk driving why don't you do it full yeah okay I I'll do
(1:37) it right now no I don't want to do it right now like oh no no of course not you do it you'll do it in the future at
(1:42) some undisclosed time let's Do's what is what is a hang on I'm sorry what is an
(1:48) open Panel an open Panel means Alex is gonna refuse to engage with Andrew because he's terrified of his questions
(1:53) is that what that means open debate means I'm not going to do [ __ ] on your terms because I think you're kind of I'm not doing anything Alex I'm going to ask
(1:59) you two two questions that are about the debate want answer your questions we can do a full debate anytime you w you want to answer the questions yeah why don't
(2:06) you want to do a full debate I I I'll do the full debate anytime you want Alex you there's no by the way just so you
(2:11) know you can pick you could pick essentially any topic you wanted it would actually be impossible for your
(2:17) imbecilic inbred ask to beat me in a debate but the thing is is like can you just answer a couple of
(2:23) questions we can let's let do what else can I do the guy won't [ __ ] I want to
(2:29) talk to you right now going take let me just gentlemen it'll take literally 10 minutes 10 minutes I promise Sher can
(2:35) start the timer I will leave in 10 minutes Al 10 there's a reason a lot of people don't want talk to everybody
(2:42) wants to talk to me Alex I have a hit show what are you talking about totally can I get oh you got Destiny's phone
(2:47) number so do I oh you got all these people's phone I have all of them Alex I know all these people you don't know what you're talking about bro you can
(2:54) tell they still care about each other give me the first question okay dude it'll be okay I'm not going to play this stupid [ __ ] game with what game I
(3:00) just want I want to engage in what you're talking about with the debate I don't care about any of this other stuff just the debate why don't we just set up
(3:06) a date right now can I just ask you a couple questions about this debate hang you're not gonna let me ask you any
(3:11) questions about the current debate if we're gonna do a debate I'm gonna prep for it it's not I just want to ask you
(3:16) some question about this debate can do it we can we can talk about this debate can can I just ask you a couple questions about this open for next week
(3:23) yeah can I can I ask you a couple questions about this debate you want yeah can I can I ask you a couple of questions about this debate you want to
(3:30) do a debate is there a reason I can't ask you questions about this debate because if we're going to debate I want to prep for it oh well we're not even
(3:35) debating I'm just G to ask you some questions about this debate number two I don't have the mental energy or the time
(3:41) to get into debate with you right now it's not a debate I just want to ask you a couple of questions yeah I'm good on that we can do a full debate so you're
(3:47) refusing you're refusing when a panelist comes on to answer any questions I'm just refusing to answer questions from
(3:52) you right now okay so okay then can I can I reference them can I reference them to Jake rattlesnake then Sarah
(3:59) since Alex too cowardly to engage wa wait what the [ __ ] I can't I
(4:05) can't talk to Jake either this is exact reason I said that I don't want to stay on if Andrew you ref bro you're the one
(4:12) refusing to engage can the question can I know the question
(4:18) you said it referred to the drunk driving thing yeah so so I want to ask I want he won't even let me talk this guy
(4:25) won't even let me talk I just want to ask Jake this question Alex brought up drunk driving deaths right he brought
(4:32) this up as a part of his argument Jake do you remember how many he said there there were 37 a day or something yeah
(4:39) okay well I mean it's a significant number you would agree with me right yeah yeah but how do we know exactly
(4:46) that it was the alcohol that caused those deaths it just says hang on hang on hang on hang on they just say it's alcohol related isn't that just a
(4:53) correlate Alex the only the only question I'm going to answer is what they were going to have is Alex isn't that just a correlate though I'm just
(4:59) not answer any question unless it's yeah okay well Jake Jake isn't that just a corlet that is just a coret that's
(5:05) really weird though I don't understand why Alex is saying that these are facts when he's just pointing Alex why are you
(5:10) talking why are you talking Alex you won't even respond to my questions shut the [ __ ] up for two seconds why are why
(5:15) when I'm talking to Jake I'm talking to Jake I know you like to hear what's the point that you're trying to make that
(5:21) that alcohol doesn't cause car Rex well no I'm just making the point that if if Alex is looking for things which are
(5:27) causal yeah anyway Alex it's my turn it's my turn to talk bro what are you talking about I know you love to talk so
(5:33) if if Alex is saying that these things are causal okay go ahead Alex go ahead Alex we can set up another date I'd be
(5:40) happy to do it yeah know I'm not talking to you right now though why are you still interjecting soing my question so it's
(5:45) not yeah it's not well it's not causal right so Alex's whole point in the debate was he wanted Jake to show him
(5:52) something which I'm not I'm not allowed to talk again let me clarify something really
(5:58) quick so typically how we we go is we run debates and then afterwards we do open Panel the open Panel is to allow
(6:05) other panelists to come on ask other questions and and kind of incentivize a new conversation or maybe poke holes in
(6:12) something that somebody said it's very typical it's common on this platform this is a a common practice this is how
(6:18) we do it so uh Alex you certainly don't have to answer the questions uh but but
(6:25) I would ask that we like keep the the bantering of your
(6:30) little back and down to a minimal because there's other people here that would like to engage in the conversation
(6:35) that's totally fair I wanted to take up too much time I just want to ask Jake if if Alex want to get okay go ahead Alex
(6:41) go ahead Alex was I not abundantly clear that I don't want to get into what Andrew you don't have to
(6:47) Alex you don't have to I won't even talk to you anymore I'm not even gonna talk to you anymore more than I'd be more
(6:52) than happy yeah you just talk about me I'd be more than happy to schedule to be with I just want to
(6:57) talk there's still a lot of there literally just want to talk about the debate Alex I'd be more than happy to do
(7:03) it on this channel Sarah can moderate I'd be happy to have a full debate with Andrew I don't want to then then then Alex then Alex just
(7:11) just go away then Alex go away I mean if only clear I express then go away Alex
(7:17) so I can talk to Jake the go like just go away then like if you if you if you won't even ask
(7:25) question let me ask this did anybody else before Alex does have to leave did
(7:30) anybody else have questions for Alex that's not named Andrew at this time yeah go
(7:38) ahead I sides what's that Chris I have questions
(7:44) for both sides I had some for Jake and for Alex okay Alex time limit so if you
(7:50) want to ask your questions to Alex first that would be more you know before he leaves yeah Alex I just wanted to find
(7:57) out right so mainly if if we talk about the societal impact right if many things
(8:04) cause people to not be on this planet anymore right but a core fundamental
(8:10) thing to have Society carry on is people so don't you think that the sex work
(8:16) industry inhibits family creation which would be the core most important thing
(8:22) we can lose a lot of people if we make more people dude um I agree that I think
(8:27) it's not good for meeting uh I guess the I just I just think that
(8:33) the other important thing to consider is the macro doesn't always affect the micro like for example in America our
(8:38) military recruitment numbers alltime low uh we absolutely 100% need more military
(8:43) to carry out our foreign policy and whatnot and but at the same time that's a macro fact but on a micro level I
(8:49) would never say like hey Chris go join the American Military right so while the
(8:54) macro Point you're making is true I just don't think that affects the micro directly right if it leads to things
(9:00) like like robots there would be no point in procreation because you're taking the
(9:06) main incentive of cuming robots but I much prefer with my
(9:12) girlfriend you don't need a robot people with less things forever or not everyone you see that's the that's I think most
(9:19) guys would still if given like 99% of guys the option robot sex with a girl
(9:24) they track yeah but you understand that the correlative to carrying on with this
(9:29) would equal the cancellation of male to female relationships or create
(9:35) barriers yeah I just don't see that I think that the vast majority of people will still have sex with their partner
(9:41) ban your hand can I can I ask Jake my question now uh so so Jake when in in
(9:46) regards to alcohol when you're talking about what is a correlative isn't it
(9:52) true that those drunk driving accidents that Alex is citing are in your debate
(9:57) that he was citing are just correlative that this is not actually the cause and
(10:02) so so I don't understand why it is you're being asked to cite a cause when all causes are just correlative if he
(10:09) states that this thing is a fact it's a fact that these people died from the alcohol he would have to prove that
(10:16) right all he did was show you a correlative right Jake yeah exactly it's an aspect of why the person died and
(10:23) it's uh it's car car well we don't know we don't even know if it's an aspect of why they died we just know alcohol was
(10:30) it's just a correlative right so when somebody says to you hang on so when somebody says to you oh you have to show
(10:36) me a cative all empiricists know that it's the strong positive which is or the correlative which is what we point to
(10:43) for the for the causitive so when somebody says to you in the future hey drunk driving accidents kill x amount of
(10:50) people well no that's an alcohol rated accident it's just the correlation is
(10:55) there to the actual alcohol so that argument is kind of N and void I don't even understand why it was made and then
(11:01) kind of to the second point for Jake because Alex won't answer this but to Jake is it I don't when we do a debate I
(11:08) don't I don't actually understand this do that you want to do the debate tomorrow uh let's do sometime next week
(11:14) I can't do of course it has to be sometime next week okay so anyway I have a [ __ ] Monday podcast which I've done for yeah no you're never gonna get more
(11:20) views than when I'm on with you what are you talking
(11:26) about never you're never I don't even know why you're cutting in but anyway so to Jake my second point when it when it
(11:32) came to the CP convo uh this is really strange to me if you're talking about uh
(11:38) anything being in a Black Market anything that is black uh on a black market is necessarily going to increase
(11:44) it uh which is what Alex's argument was why wouldn't Alex argue to go ahead and
(11:50) legalize CP then I actually don't even understand
(11:56) that I'm sure you don't I mean you
(12:02) could good on this like I don't if we're gonna do a debate me and you then I want it to be like a full debate where I have
(12:08) time to organize my thoughts so once again do would you want to pick a date for next week you want to do like uh
(12:13) tomorrow Thursday tomorrow I have well I'm booked I'm booked all the time Alex but I got tomorrow open okay well I'm
(12:19) not gonna do tomorrow I have my Monday podcast that I'm not gonna flake on but we can do Thursday Tuesday Tuesday is Christmas Eve you want to do a Christmas
(12:25) Eve debate uh I can do Christmas day but not Christmas Eve wow
(12:31) Christmas Day I'm Avail we I can do Thursday I can do uh
(12:38) next Sunday all right let's do Thursday same exact topic okay sure my got a date
(12:44) again y'all are gay we can moderate as well if we need guys Flow
(12:55) State but just so you know I only came on here to ask you questions which were related to this debate that's it I I
(13:02) know you did yeah literally that's all I came on here to do yeah it just you could have just easily texted me at any
(13:08) point and said hey I want to why would I need to text you I wanted to come on the open Panel and ask you questions about the debate made it made it clear that I
(13:15) don't feel like talking just even even to just answer two questions I would have just left you guys tell me what
(13:21) happened what if I like let me ask what have I ever ambushed you it's never happened this was a panel the only
(13:28) reason I even interjected here at all is because my buddy is debating with you so I watch the debate live with the
(13:34) audience I wanted to come on ask you two questions about the debate I've never ever ambushed you even one time so I
(13:40) don't even know why you're so upset bro I don't even know don't gasl me I'm not upset well when have I ever ambushed you
(13:46) Alex ever never right when have I ever ambushed you well that's my whole point is like why why not just answer to a
(13:52) couple of questions so weird to me dude glad that you guys got it out you a million times I know how it works it's
(13:58) never two questions it was two questions that's all I had I literally gave you my word I told you you could set up a
(14:03) 10-minute timer Alex never ever two questions with you yeah I mean I don't know why you think you're GNA Fair
(14:09) better Thursday of the same topic like it say whatever you want to organize my
(14:14) thoughts you can organize your thoughts but I just had I just had two questions about this insistent on doing it this
(14:20) very second I just wanted to ask two questions about this debate to you because I want to know it seems like for
(14:26) a while you were scared to do a whole debate it seems like for a while you just wanted nothing to do with it so I
(14:31) still well Alex no no no no hang on hang on I still don't want to work with you but I do I did want two answers to I
(14:37) wanted the answers to the questions I had about the debate yeah that's true yeah I don't know why the change of for but you don't want to debate me anymore
(14:43) no no no no debating you isn't working with you I not working with you how do we
(14:50) work together H hold on all right you guys don't work together you got something coming up you're
(14:56) good make up already guys I know should we speed date them make them speed date
(15:02) maybe they'll kiss and make up I think we
(15:08) should no Jesus Christ I'm not no SAR I don't want to [ __ ] just you don't want to
(15:14) speak well yeah so I mean it doesn't even have to be unfriendly dude I really only came
(15:20) on here to ask two questions yeah but so the first the first question was just about the drunk driving and the
(15:26) correlation and then the second one was just going to be go ahead go ahead yeah but the thing is that I debate you
(15:32) enough times to know that you're extremely bad faith and it's never too questions you were bad faith in this
(15:37) debate how was I that faith in this because because you used what you knew
(15:43) was uh empirically false which is you said that the opposition was making correlation causation uh
(15:50) fallacy the problem that you have with that is that from the empiricist mindset you should know that all all of what
(15:59) anything you consider causitive is correlative such as drunk driving you for instance Alex you could never tell
(16:04) me that all these drunk driving accidents happened because of the alcohol like maybe some of these people drive better because they're drunk you
(16:10) don't know you just you just it you just use it as a correlative and that happens
(16:17) a lot of people drive better when they're drunk yeah sure I'm sure they do I'm sure some do really you think most
(16:23) people you think a lot of people I didn't say most or I didn't say a lot I just all it all it means is that you cannot make the determin
(16:32) can you make the determination that it was the alol in how do you know it was the alcohol Alex how do you know it was the alcohol
(16:39) yeah this is this is like again this is why I just that's not bad faith Alex why how do you know it was the alcohol Alex
(16:46) well if you can't agree on the fact that if you think that a lot of people drive better when they're drunk then we're
(16:51) just I mean there's got to be at least one right there's got to be at least one
(16:57) person who drives better drunk right the exception makes the rule no no but if there's even one with the correlative
(17:04) there's at least one person who uh because because they watch TP don't go out and uh sure sure that but but that
(17:10) would still be that has nothing to do the fact that alcohol might not be causal directly has
(17:17) nothing to do with whether or not P should be illegal well well but that aside my
(17:22) whole point was if you say to somebody that uh you need to give me a positive link all positive links are just
(17:29) correlative links you're just looking at strong correlatives all of them including drunk driving that's it there's no what was the outcome you know
(17:37) that and that was bad faith because you don't think there's a difference between causation coration what is the what is the outcome that P was alleging no no no
(17:44) hang on hang on there is a difference but how do we determine the cause of something well some sometimes we don't
(17:51) know for sure right so how do we determine the cause of something Alex how do we do it I know like for example if you do an experiment yeah and you uh
(17:58) for example um let's see how would you determine the lights in your room from electricity wait just be quiet for two
(18:05) seconds if you want to answer a question if you don't go ahead no go ahead go ahead answer so if you do an experiment
(18:11) for example and it turns out that you completely eliminate every other Factor so let's say that uh Sweden legalizes
(18:19) sex for and there's no other confounding Factor there is uh no immigration that's happening just you eliminate every
(18:25) confounding factor and then you show how do you know that youve eliminated every Factor well you you make an educated
(18:31) guess right right right so so it's just correlative then because
(18:38) there no no from the empiricist worldview which is yours it's impossible
(18:44) it's impossible to make a positive it's impossible to say something is C is causitive without looking at what's
(18:50) correlative it's actually impossible it's not even possible right that cigarette and yeah and you
(18:58) get that's actually a good point like if I get cancer from this cigarette can you prove that it was because of the
(19:03) cigarette so just because you can't 100% absolutely Pro something does you're looking at a causal link right clear you
(19:11) don't believe that there's when it comes to studies or anything there's any type of causations no that's not what I said I said what we would look at is we would
(19:18) look at the co we would look the causitive would be the strongest correlates that would be what we would
(19:23) say was the cause that's exactly what Jake was doing when you want to eliminate
(19:28) he was what's the cause that Jake was making so Jake Jake uh provided a series of studies which stated emphatically and
(19:36) by the way these were actually adjusted uh for many of these correlations that Alex was talking about Alex dismisses
(19:42) the argument and says well this just looks like it's uh uh something which is correlation not causation but the thing
(19:48) is is like all causation is going to come from correlation the point coming
(19:53) from correlation all of it so it's like really bad
(19:59) causation I know you would talk about bad fat since you do it all the time if you talk about you don't even know what that means if you talk about you don't
(20:06) know what it means you don't you don't know what bad what does even mean it means I'm unwilling to change my view I
(20:12) thought you had two questions you you're the one continuing the conversation I'm good dude I've been I'm good on talking
(20:18) to you for a while man asking questions this is this is why I said that you're never you're never actually like
(20:23) honestly you're still going Alex not me never it was never going to be too you're still going not me quick okay
(20:30) you're the one still going not me I dig your plant then just stop talking I did
(20:35) okay then I'm good thanks man yeah do you think that they're gay I think you're gay oh my
(20:46) God I'm just saying the sexual tension was thick yeah it's definitely I mean you you would know I mean you've had a
(20:52) lot of those experiences you're or I'm rubber you're a glue yeah
(20:58) yeah you even got that wrong it's been a while since kindergarten for me I don't know you're the one making gay jokes
(21:05) bro so um what happened to y'all nothing nothing happened there's
(21:12) no beef between myself and Alex I don't say bad word about Alex Eber yeah except for when you made that
(21:19) stream that I I backstabbed you and that uh yeah yeah this is so this is super
(21:25) old right we moved past that a long time ago I don't say anything about man when do I do it and you said you said the
(21:31) same thing right we don't I that's why I came in here just to ask a couple of questions I didn't come in here to Ambush you I've never done it once yeah
(21:37) you just okay so you're just totally good faith like right your point was just when have I ever ambushed you this
(21:43) is a fallacy called middle school girl drama the point though that he's making
(21:50) is a fair point though the point I didn't do anything wrong from all causation comes from
(21:56) correlation you holding me to a different standard you're holding yourself right I agree Andrew's point
(22:01) about correlation is correct but that I mean it's it's a it's a derivative point on a derivative Point not a derivative
(22:07) point it is the point so how does that how does that point well let me explain if you take a
(22:14) study from a person you say well this is just showing something stupid this is
(22:20) just showing something which is not causitive but a correlation the thing is though is you can only get to a positive
(22:26) from a correlation so it's like you're already admitting that there's a problem here and so this what happened was uh
(22:33) Jake didn't actually know that that's the case I don't think right but all all Links of causes come from correlation so
(22:41) when somebody says well did didn't you didn't you mix up the causal and the correlative link it's like no if the
(22:46) link is strong enough that's the cause that's how we determine a cause but all that does is reduce the uh the strength
(22:53) for drunk driving laws it doesn't actually increase the argument for for Banning P well no no it would what it
(22:59) would do is it would say if your argument here is to say well wait a second I'm going to State this as a fact
(23:05) the fact is x amount of people die die from drunk driving related deaths per year which is probably true right x
(23:11) amount of people die from alcohol rated deaths per year but the thing is is that
(23:18) that's just a that's not a causal link we haven't actually demonstrated alcohol was causing that we just have
(23:23) demonstrated that alcohol was involved and so but this the correlation we could say is strong enough that we can say
(23:31) okay probably alcohol had a role here in many of these deaths right but but you
(23:36) can't state that as a fact and then say but Jake I agree with you that you're
(23:41) stating a fact that there's a correlation here between sex trafficking and sex work right but that's just
(23:48) that's you know that's uh that's just a correlation it's like you're making the same argument yourself the other way I I
(23:54) I would agree with that it's not the best argument like way past the 20 minutes I do got to go well it was nice to see you
(24:00) again Alex I have no bad blood yeah and for what it's worth Alex I thought that you did uh great from the parts that I
(24:05) heard and I agreed with basically all of it thanks I appreciate it by way Alex Merry Christmas you
(24:12) wantan to give your final thoughts Alex I mean I already I already wrapped it up in my illusion uh but yeah I mean
(24:20) I stand by everything I said uh I'm looking forward to doing that debate on Thursday should be fun uh we'll see same
(24:26) topic right same topic yeah or we can get into actually topic I'm more interested is getting into Trump yeah
(24:32) I'd like to debate this topic though okay like you want to debate the same topic we can do half and half we
(24:38) can do half and half I'm hosting this right am I am I throwing myself um yeah
(24:45) yeah sure yeah something like that I don't hey Alex what uh what color
(24:50) Crystal would you want to go in Bud what what I'm confused say that again
(24:58) what color Crystal would you uh prefer um I I don't know what that what
(25:04) you're GNA have to say the punch line because nobody really understands the question is that a mushroom tip what is
(25:10) that no okay
(25:16) no I prefer a blue one all right well not really a question so I didn't know I
(25:23) was trying to is there mer Christmas Alex yeah Merry Christmas to you too have a good one
(25:31) isn't there a COR causation with ice if the if the temperature goes down below Z degrees C it causes the ice the water to
(25:39) turn to ice and that's I don't know the temperature seems causal corative it's going to be related to other factors
(25:45) like atmospheric pressure and things like that yeah just so you know like a true empir a true empiricist never makes
(25:52) the claim that something is 100% true they basically only use the strength of the C causality or not the causality the
(26:00) uh contributing factors to what they think is the causality to give themselves a sense of shity now you can
(26:06) say 99% 99.9 99.99 you're sure sure I would even
(26:12) agree with that I'm just saying that you can't dismiss somebody's argument and say well you know this isn't the cause
(26:18) this is just a correlator it's like but how strong is the correlator that's what if you use the same argument back well
(26:26) I'm using a correlative argument for drunk driving it's like all you're using is the same correlation the other
(26:32) direction yeah just neutralizes both people's
(26:37) arguments in that situation yeah but the whole to show it's redtive absurdum
(26:43) formally which is showing a fallacy that Alex is doing by affirming on his view correct by saying this is a defeater for
(26:49) this position while simultaneously holding this is not a defeater for my position my position right it's it's an
(26:55) argument at absurdum exactly right it's it's an inadequate way to put down Jake's Point well the problem is like
(27:02) Jake was supremely good faith and engaging in good faith uh I think Alex
(27:07) was too I'm not beating him up I think he was I think he has a um he's he's heard many of these different arguments
(27:12) and this type of thing and the alcohol comparison to sex work is a very old argument but the thing is is like it
(27:18) it's a it's a very quick defeater to this idea that uh hey I'll hold you to a
(27:24) separate standard than I'm holding myself for my own stats it's like no that's no that's no bueno Andrew um one
(27:31) of the things that annoys me about this is that the alcohol industry itself does
(27:36) not cause harm the usage of it does whereas sex work the the the industry
(27:42) itself causes harm and the use so you can't really draw I don't understand I
(27:47) don't understand even the argument here so uh when when I get into my car my car
(27:53) yells at me to put my seat belt on literally it disconnect that it says it says put your seat belt on stupid put
(27:59) your seat belt on stupid until I do it literally yells at me until I do I see Billboards everywhere don't drink and
(28:05) drive I see right here on this pack of cigarettes a surgeon general's warning on the side explaining the harm that'll
(28:11) happen from smoking this cigarette where is all of this for the corn industry no [ __ ] place nowhere no government
(28:17) intervention nobody pushing for any of this and it's like that makes no [ __ ] sense to me whatsoever if you
(28:23) demonstrate hey we know that this is at least in some way harmful you would think that there' be some type of
(28:28) government oversight here nothing anybody here show hands real
(28:35) quick anybody here ever seen a billboard sign that says uh you know doing porn could be bad for you anybody
(28:42) ever no um I I have I have seen I have seen Billboards yeah outside of uh you
(28:49) know the adult shops on I70 that say what like Jesus was
(28:55) watching or some [ __ ] like that it yeah those are those are private right but anybody ever
(29:00) seen a government billboard that says hey only fans could really be detrimental to your health it could spread STDs it could do all sorts of bad
(29:06) thing never never see that by the way you can't open a bar next to a school
(29:11) yet you can rent a room right above one and do only fans it's like this is [ __ ] it's [ __ ] ridiculous right
(29:17) the idea here that alcohol and cigarettes isn't highly regulated there's stigma all over it there's
(29:22) smoking sections non-smoking sections the stigma is so bad in fact that we've
(29:29) managed through stigma to reduce this significantly on both sides alcoholism highly stigmatized right prostitution
(29:36) not so much and it's like no I don't think so this uh this doesn't seem like it's a it's a great argument
(29:42) here but that just means other people don't look as cool as we do that's right Smoky makes you look
(29:49) cool increases your testosterone that's right two servings of vegetables you got
(29:54) your tobacco and your Menthol if you're me and just just always remember Jake whenever you beat somebody in an argument you're bad faith that's the way
(30:00) it works yep yep noticed yep your bad faith if you want to ask him questions
(30:06) you're bad faith if you win in an argument your bad faith if by the way I did notice Alex took a neutral position
(30:13) so that he could explore your worldview when I did that I was bad faith by the way I just want to point that out but
(30:19) anyway uh that's it I I just wanted to pop on uh briefly unless you have degenerates coming up here that me and
(30:24) Jake rattlesnake can completely de devastate which I you're going to call me out like that by
(30:30) name you're not a [ __ ] degenerate you're a Catholic horen stop coping dude no I'm not I'm the de whatever just a
(30:37) Catholic apologist okay yeah whatever dude you're [ __ ] Catholic just shut up you're not a I'll swap sides to fight
(30:43) a bit as well you're not a degenerate either ofone [ __ ]
(30:49) are flow State's not a [ __ ] Deen I'm the degener I might be I don't know wait I'm not enough of a Deen anymore I like
(30:58) when the [ __ ] did that happen somebody send me nude are you logical Flow State rational am I
(31:06) logical yeah you think Korn's great Flow State state no I don't think Corn's
(31:12) great I think it's I I think that banning it would be
(31:17) more harmful I can get be ofing
(31:24) over uh Dano coming with a big five Alex if making something illegal causes more problems and doesn't decrease the
(31:30) activity why would I why would you advocate for CP to be illegal wouldn't that be
(31:36) worse uh Matt coming in with a big five Jake your mom is going to be home in an hour not sure what that refers to the
(31:43) reason that you would advocate for CP to be illegal even though prohibition is not an effective form of reduction is
(31:48) because the the victims in CP have a right to be defended and protected
(31:54) protecting how does it not make sense well because here's why the idea here is
(31:59) the reduction of said thing and said thing is going to increase by you uh you
(32:04) know using the state to oppress said thing then logically you would want the said thing to be legal so that it could
(32:10) be regulated or something like this because it would actually reduce it so on a on a individual
(32:18) level I personally think it would be immortal to look to to know something like that is going on and to go hands
(32:23) off because for the greater good but um on a on a more societal
(32:28) I don't think they're the same because I think that CP appeals to a mental disorder
(32:34) um but you want L you want less of it right so there's not a growing customer
(32:41) base you can always get somebody else hook Hooked On A New Drug you can't always make makes no sense bro does it
(32:47) does wait does criminalizing something reduce it or
(32:52) not there's more variables that go into that that's what I'm saying question that the answer is no
(32:59) it's that you're asking the question wrong it's they're not equivalent drugs have everybody as a potential customer
(33:06) CP does not GE hang hang on let us finish real
(33:13) quick I'll only be a second I'm going to ask this again because you can just say no if this isn't the case is it not the
(33:20) your worldview that criminalizing something creates a black market for it actually increases the production of
(33:26) said thing it increases the Val the price of the said thing but it doesn't
(33:31) increas not it does not necessarily increase the quantity of it because if
(33:37) it increases the price and less people are gonna get it I've already I I just already explained why the two are not equivalent it's because there but it
(33:44) makes no sense because if it necessarily raises the price less people are going to do it therefore you would want to criminalize
(33:51) it it raises it raises the price because the prohibition but it doesn't increase the market share for for something that
(33:57) is not there's not a custom a potential customer Market with CP that can grow
(34:03) into I don't believe I don't know this for sure why not because I don't think you or I are
(34:09) going to say that you know what if we were just exposed to it more we would then become CP fans either of us if
(34:16) either of us started smoking crack we would probably become regular customers wait a second wait a second so you're saying you're saying wait you're saying
(34:22) so that that's like saying this you agree with me that some people may not ever drank alcohol but if they did they
(34:29) would become addicted to alcohol right that's that's not what I was say
(34:35) can you answer my question sorry ask it again do you agree with me that some people who would
(34:41) become addicted to alcohol never become addicted to alcohol because they never drank alcohol correct okay so this would
(34:47) entail then that by giving them set alcohol right the chances of them becoming alcoholics greatly increases
(34:54) how would that not be the same case with CP because people adults who are attracted to children don't need CP to
(35:01) figure out they're attracted to Children wait wait wait wait wait how do
(35:06) you know yeah I I don't know I'm you don't know right exactly that makes
(35:12) sense well so what we can look at hold on you think that nobody you think
(35:17) studies I have some studies that I can show you where don't know they're attracted to
(35:22) kids until they encounter CP it's there's a good yeah not only is is there a strong correlative for this
(35:28) but it's so strong that they outlawed uh CP sex dolls for this particular reason
(35:35) because what they found was that people who engaged in that activity were more prone to enact it in reality but wasn't
(35:42) more prone to gather people I think is argument therefore so therefore so so
(35:48) then Therefore your position that by outlawing this it would actually decrease the market share that would be
(35:55) Jake Jake rattlesnakes and my position as well but if you wanted to be consistent with your other positions you'd have to say you should
(36:01) decriminalize it because it would reduce it the two the two will not be consistent with each other because they are not the same Paradigm the same
(36:08) Paradigm yeah yeah it's not the same Paradigm I know trying to make the situations the same but they're not the
(36:14) same it's the same exact Paradigm if if it is true that taking a drink if you never take a drink you never become an
(36:21) alcoholic therefore no alcohol around you never can indulge in alcohol be the same exact case if there's no you know
(36:28) thing that triggers the mind for CP you never see it right there's a great chance the correlation there is that
(36:34) you'll never engage in it my that PE is it is not CP that causes pedos to
(36:40) recognize that they're attracted to kids prove it there's kids in the world yeah but that doesn't mean until they see the
(36:46) act that they're into the act and I don't have an answer for that
(36:51) do do you do you know do you know yes well that the study the studies that I've read about it is that people who
(36:58) have and they they call it I'm not even going to say what they call it but the thing is people who have this quote
(37:04) Affliction right we'll just call them Psychopaths and lunatics people have this Affliction uh often say that
(37:10) there's a trigger for it they see somebody who's naked when they shouldn't or they see some sort of activity like
(37:17) this and then they start moving towards it it stands to Total reason that that would be the case that is most of the
(37:22) case with most sexual forms of deviancy for instance far less homosexuals without the portrayal of homosexuality
(37:28) in other words you don't know what you don't know women say report that they're far more sexually satisfied uh when they
(37:35) get married as virgins why because they have no sense of reference to what other sex feels like so it makes total sense
(37:42) it's and I'm not got or site your sources but if you have that I would be
(37:48) interested to see it sometime it's I don't know if it R but it's all logical yeah whoever said
(37:56) that go ahead Flow State have you heard of a small island north of Australia called Papa New
(38:04) Guinea on this small island there's another smaller group of people we like to call the simbari Sean Warriors yes
(38:13) well yeah they're become Warriors I'm not we're not kidding not Christmas theme okay I can't believe
(38:21) somebody got that name before me that's so the simbari [ __ ] Warriors a right of passage into adulthood is the
(38:28) children of the people end up sucking the dick of their Elders correct now there doesn't seem to be any harm done
(38:35) to these people they don't have any of these mental health conditions or any of these things we say would you have an issue if we like took videos of this
(38:42) happening and sold that as the child porn yes why would you and I don't have
(38:48) a logical support for it right now yes I've got an issue with that no it does hold consist kill the
(38:54) screen mystery thank you Sarah for letting me on the panel Jake just wanted to come on and say that was a fun debate
