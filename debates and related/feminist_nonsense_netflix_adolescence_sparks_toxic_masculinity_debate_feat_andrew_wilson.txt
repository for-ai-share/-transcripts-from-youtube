(0:53) adolescence on Netflix is currently the biggest show in the world The genre about a 13-year-old misogynist who kills
(0:59) a teenage girl has been seen by 25 million people so far and was raised by the British Prime Minister in Parliament
(1:08) With our children I've got a 16-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl It's a very very good uh uh uh uh uh documentary uh
(1:16) to watch or drama Um she this violence carried out by young
(1:22) men influenced by what they see online is a real um problem It's ahorrent Um
(1:27) and we have to tackle it It's actually a fictional story Prime Minister not a
(1:32) documentary but the prime minister referenced It tells the story of young boys who are radicalized by content online There are references to the
(1:39) manosphere the matrix incelss and red pills Andrew Tate gets a name check And
(1:44) that part of the show has sparked an outpouring of commentary about the abject horrors of the internet and the crisis of male role models Bang by a
(1:52) girl you saucy You're not getting it What am I not
(1:57) getting Dad you're not reading what they're doing It's a call to action by the
(2:03) manosphere 80% of women are attracted to 20% of men You must trick them cuz
(2:10) you'll never get them in a normal way
(2:16) [Music]
(2:22) Well The Guardian summed up the general tone of the reporting with a headline that said "From the police to the prime minister how adolescence is making
(2:28) Britain face up to toxic masculinity." But is it really Can it not just be a successful drama that references popular
(2:35) culture as so many do Critics of the show say it's another version of the same man bashing narrative that gave
(2:41) rise to the so-called manosphere in the first place Well here to debate all this is the host of The Crucible Andrew
(2:46) Wilson The radio host James Bar the host of Tommy Lren is Fearless One Outkick Tommy Lren and the host of the
(2:52) Determined Society Sean Fred Welcome to all of you Um Andrew Wilson let me start with you because I've got three sons uh
(3:00) 31 27 24 Uh I I think I brought them up to respect women to not behave in a
(3:06) misogynist way um and to behave in a pretty decent way generally Um but I'm
(3:11) also aware that they've grown up in an era when the likes of Andrew Tate and others have become increasingly dominant
(3:19) in the way that a lot of impressionable young men start to think and view women
() 
(3:24) And for all that Andrew Tate can say that is positive about getting fit and being successful and confident and so on
(3:31) there's indisputably a hardcore streak of misogyny that run through his veins
(3:38) which I think has been quite damaging to young men So I'm you know I'm not I'm not all in either way here but I can
(3:44) certainly see the arguments Where do you sit Yeah Well I mean I think that this
(3:50) this So I watched the show and it just goes through a a typical feminine view right So all of these things are always
(3:57) through the prism of the feminine So young boys they don't do well in school They don't do well in school because uh
(4:03) it's all programmed for the feminine Uh stay still fold your hands right Be quiet Boys are rambunctious They like to
(4:09) beat each other up They like to be mischievous They they like to uh break things They like to do that kind of
(4:15) stuff There's no outlet for them to do that stuff Their teachers are all women right There's basically all masculinity
(4:22) is now considered toxic Basically all of it The same women who are getting their double shot of espresso on the way over
(4:30) to uh the school they're about to teach at They're 24 years old Sometimes they're banging their own students right
(4:36) Hilariously enough And then these people go out to Parliament The same women go to Parliament They vote to send men off
(4:42) to war to stab each other in the face with bayonets And you're concerned about
(4:47) toxic masculinity It cracks me up It's like the brutal savagery of men is a
(4:53) necessary precondition for society to exist and we just kind of pretend like it's not And this show should actually
(5:00) be an indictment on the feminine rather than the masculine because basically
(5:05) masculinity is just punished everywhere all the time non-stop It's no wonder guys like Andrew Tate uh get so famous
(5:11) in these spaces Uh I mean what's the alternative The alternative is everything must be feminine Tone
(5:18) policing nonsense like this It's ridiculous All right James Bar you were laughing but I don't think I don't think
() 
(5:23) you'll enjoy what you're hearing No I mean that's you I don't think you've seen the show Episode two is shot
(5:29) entirely in a school I didn't see one of the female teachers drinking a double shot of espresso at all None of the
(5:35) teachers were flirting with students There were male teachers as well I don't think you're describing the show here I think you're describing your own
(5:41) insecurities or agenda Yeah So this doesn't contend with the
(5:46) argument Like do you understand that I'm making an argument indictment of society itself based around my ideas that I'm
(5:53) I'm seeing from this show That's what I'm actually doing So if you could contend with the fact that male savagery
(5:58) is necessary for the security of a nation and that women will indeed vote in the future in parliaments to send men
(6:04) off to war to stab each other in the face at 18 years old with bayonets perhaps you can contend with that before
(6:10) we start uh you know getting into well policing is actually good and uh toxic
(6:16) masculinity is actually bad It's like I think there needs to be a little bit more toxic masculinity or what you
(6:21) consider to be toxic masculinity Well great Good for you I'm glad you
(6:27) think so Nothing I mean I just don't need to argue with that because you just stun unlocked You just stun locked You
(6:32) got nothing You're you're making up You do seem unusually I've not said anything I
(6:39) haven't literally said nothing about you were literally rendered silent You're nowhere I'll tell you why You can't
(6:44) argue with a completely illogical argument that had like I've not made any It's a logical argument You may not agree with it He's not made any logical
(6:51) argument that you were firing at me None of those comments are things I've said or believe in All right I want to bring
(6:57) Tommy in because Tommy you got a very interesting perspective I think you've talked about something different You call it the pussification of men which
(7:04) is a great phrase I'd love you to just explain what you mean by that but also you're not a fan of Andrew Tate all the
(7:10) influence he has So that's makes you I think an interesting commentator in this area So just explain first of all the
(7:17) pussification of men All right Pierce I think and I can't see
() 
(7:23) you all so forgive me if I'm incorrect here but I think I'm I'm the only female on this panel so I'm really anxious to
(7:29) weigh in Okay So I think over the last probably 10 years there has been what I
(7:35) call the pussification of men It was everything should be about your emotions and your feelings and men were
(7:41) emasculated and this whole concept of toxic masculinity warped the minds of a lot of young men and they felt masculine
(7:48) They wanted to be masculine but society was telling them they should be softer That it was being toxically masculine if
(7:55) you wanted to play sports and chop wood and go to war And so men were so emasculated and so beat down that then
(8:03) there was this revolution of what was actually toxic masculinity the Tate brothers and others which I feel as a
(8:10) female that that doesn't represent true masculinity That to me represents douchebaggery And as a woman I want a
(8:17) strong man who is a protector and a provider that will go to war if need be that will protect me protect my family
(8:24) make money I see that as being actually masculine That's like the man that I grew up with my dad But what we're
(8:30) seeing now is these young men who look at Andrew Tate and the Tate brothers and they see somebody who's just quite
(8:36) frankly a douchebag and disrespects women And because they've been so emasculated they're like "Oh great
(8:42) That's a manly man." But that's not right either So at some point I think we'll go back to maybe meeting in the
(8:48) middle here You can be a man who has feelings and emotions but you can also go to war and protect and defend your
(8:54) family I'm hoping we can get back there But the two extremes right now they're confusing men and quite frankly they're
(9:01) leaving women with few choices and that's the real tragedy here You see I completely agree with you but Andrew you
(9:08) were shaking your head quite vigorously Why Yeah Well I mean this just more feminine or feminist nonsense ultimately
(9:15) And the covert feminism in society is big especially on the conservative side So here's here's what happens right
(9:22) Women need to have feminine virtues for men to be pursuing masculine virtues For
(9:27) you to say things like "Well men what I want is for men to protect me and I want men to make money." Well that's great
(9:33) What that ends up doing is it gives you a set of privilege in society What do men get What do men get for doing that
(9:41) for you What are we getting from women for doing that Are we getting chased virgins on our wedding night No we're
(9:46) not getting chased virgins on our wedding night Are we getting women of great virtue No we're not getting women
(9:52) of great virtue The idea of courtly love is supposed to be done for women of great virtue Where are they Well they're
(9:59) nowhere And so in modernity in society when conservative influencer female conservative influencers say this it's
(10:05) actually a form of covert feminism And they're saying "I want privilege in society right?" But what is it women are
(10:10) giving to men to get it What What are they giving them Tell me
(10:17) Can I please chime in here Yes you can And then then James can and then I'll come to you Sean No I would love to I
(10:23) love this whole thing of like if you're a female conservative and you don't believe that men should be douchebags
(10:30) that all of a sudden you're a covert feminist Call me a feminist I really don't give one crap one way or another
(10:36) But I can tell you this a lot of these men these podcast hosts on the right that like to think of themselves as
(10:41) these big masculine men and what am I getting out of it I can tell you this There's that feminism I believe I'm
(10:46) feminism coming out Yeah there's the feminism Oh and then and then you're interrupting me too Didn't take long did
(10:52) it Didn't take long did it Okay Yeah Oh I'm sorry Did you want to speak over a man I don't care if you call me if you
(11:00) call me a strong independent woman Yeah Yeah Yeah You're actually interrupting
(11:05) me And I didn't interrupt you when you were spewing your So now it's my turn Okay You mean you mean the truth
(11:10) Like I said before so I believe I'm a There we go again Pierce I'm a woman of
(11:15) virtue I happen to be independently successful I have a husband who's not only a former professional athlete but
(11:21) is currently a professional baseball coach So is he not a masculine man I
(11:26) mean I'm confused here What's your concept Mine is a man who respects me
(11:31) Yeah that misses the point though Like you're still not contending with the argument What's your point You're saying inside of society right this second
(11:38) right Masculinity is not only punished but also women on the right covert feminists on the right are constantly
(11:44) and consistently talking about how they need to have privilege in society I want men their version of masculinity is men
(11:50) who take care of us men who protect us men who do all of this Those are all duties that men have towards women Great
(11:56) What are the duties that women have towards men What are the duties that women have towards anything What do men
(12:02) get out of this arrangement What are we getting out of this arrangement Can you tell me I mean you argue that menately
(12:10) should I interrupt you Hang on one second Let Tommy resp Let Tommy respond to that and then I'll come to you Jez
(12:15) Then Sean you've been waiting patiently So most men are born to be protectors and providers I can't imagine my dad
(12:22) saying you know what to my mom you know what I'm not going to be a protector and a provider unless you do this That's not
(12:28) how real men operate Real men are protectors and providers and they marry
(12:33) women who hopefully have a woman but also bring a lot to the table as well that are great mothers great wives
(12:40) caretakers of the home There's nothing wrong with being a traditional wife and mother You're misunderstanding me if you
(12:46) think that I think that women should just be out doing whatever they want I think that there are gender women but I
(12:52) don't think a man needs to get something out of it to be a manly man a protector and a provider If you think you need to
(12:58) get something out of me I quite frankly don't consider you a real man Yeah she
(13:04) have nothing But we'll discuss in a moment whether Angel Wilson is a real man I offer nothing I offer nothing
(13:11) You offer me a couple of things Tommy It's why I always love having you on the show You know that Um let's go to a real
(13:17) man James Bar Thank you I do see myself as a man And I know that you'll be looking at me thinking well you're not
(13:23) You're wearing makeup You're wearing colorful clothes Like look at me I really can for my nails are painful They
(13:28) are worrying You're sat there smoking a cigarette I'd love to get a vape out and start drinking a beer You know pints
(13:34) with the lads Just connect with you over that I I think that you have some insane opinions on what women are meant to do
(13:40) for you It's crazy that you don't appreciate that a woman actually gave birth to you Like she gave you a womb
(13:46) for 9 months and then looked after you I would hope for the for the beginning of your life And you're sat there going "What do women owe men?" Women don't owe
(13:53) men anything No one owes you anything You have your own life Do you understand
(13:58) that if you make an argument and you say that your seminar on how to win an argument in a position if that women are
(14:05) supposed to be in a position of privilege where men do A B C and D for them And then I ask well what duties do women have And you say well nothing No
(14:12) one said out I don't know why men are checking out I don't get it You just
(14:17) silly man All right let me bring All right let me bring in the one person who so far hasn't said a word about this but
(14:22) has a lot of interesting things to say Uh Sean welcome to Uncensored I I mean I think one of the key things of this
(14:28) series that's made it so popular is that anyone who's had young sons knows that
(14:33) they are if you're not careful they get exposed to a lot of nasty stuff on the internet We all know this And a lot of
(14:41) it is this kind of incel stuff which I think can be a really malevolent
(14:46) influence on impressionable young men and they gravitate to it And I think
(14:52) that partly what Andrew is getting at I agree with in the sense that following the me too times up campaigns which were
(15:00) in many ways you know extremely ludable brought down a lot of very bad men no question of that but they also the
(15:06) pendulum swung so wildly that I think a lot of young men in particular became felt completely disenfranchised from
(15:13) society felt like they're all being treated like a bunch of young Harvey Weinstein unless they could prove
(15:18) otherwise they they didn't really know what the rules of engagement were with women with you know with teenage girls
(15:24) anymore whatever They lost their way And by losing their way they gravitated I
(15:30) think to pe to very loud voices on the internet like Andrew Tate who I think
(15:35) you know like I say he says a lot of stuff I find myself nodding to and then he'll say this misogynist stuff which I
(15:40) I just despise it I see no reason why you should ever uh want to have a
(15:47) relationship with a woman the way that Andrew Tate wants you to where it's just pure misogyny Um but what just talk to
(15:54) me first of all about why you think young boys teenage boys young men why
() 
(16:00) they've gravitated to people like Tate because I have Yeah Thanks Yeah So I think it's you know first of all we got
(16:06) to understand that we have an amazing responsibility as a parent to lead from the home and to have these open conversations with our young children
(16:13) All right Whether they're male children female children we have to make sure that we're having open door
(16:19) conversations and we are tackling the hard subjects because if we don't if we don't take care of everything at home we
(16:25) don't take care of everything in public like at school and other forces within society that help raise our children We
(16:31) always say it takes a village Well it it certainly does but it starts at home And if you cannot have these open
(16:37) conversations and allow your children to be honest and open with how they are feeling about society and the things
(16:43) that they are seeing they are going to go to misogyny They're going to go to the Andrew and Tristan Tates the world
(16:48) and they're going to they're going to learn how to be a man from that And that is not what society needs That's not what the world needs That is not that is
(16:55) not masculinity It is masquerading as misogyny How do we how do we protect young men from the easy access at the
(17:03) moment there is to people like Tate I mean how how do you actually put a ring fence around them so that they are you
(17:10) can tackle exactly what you've just said but they're not also being dragged into that world
(17:16) It's tough because they're growing up in a in a world we never grew up in Pierce We didn't grow up with the internet We
(17:21) didn't grow up with Bumble Tinder Instagram Facebook No I was taught I was taught how to treat women by my mother
(17:28) my grandmother Open the door right Open the door You know strong a lot of strong women in my family Very strong women And
(17:34) they would just take no crap from the men So that's the environment I grew up in
(17:39) Absolutely So how do we insulate our children from this By having conversations putting parameters around
(17:44) the social media aspects of life and having the conversations at home Hey hey son Hey daughter This is what you're
(17:50) going to see out there in the real world This is what you're going to see on the internet If you see something like this that is not how a true man is supposed
(17:57) to act And hey that's not how a real man's supposed to treat you right So we have to have the conversations Yeah
(18:04) Andrew do you intrinsically disagree with what you've just heard Yeah I do I
(18:10) think again all of this is always the burden on men Burden on men Burden on
(18:16) men Men need to be family Andrew the family Hang on Hang on Let me h Okay
(18:21) Yeah So let me let me back up Okay Again men need to do this men need to do that
(18:27) What I'm talking about is what duties do women have in society What are actual
(18:32) women's duties towards men Everybody is raised from the time they're kids how
(18:37) we're supposed to treat women We all know how to treat women We never talk about how men are supposed to be treated
(18:43) That's almost never discussed especially by how women are supposed to treat men what their duties in society are This
(18:48) has been completely dispelled Guys like Tate have risen because Christianity
(18:54) itself has become a feminized religion Especially the Protestant sex has become completely feminized And it didn't used
(19:00) to punish masculinity at all And now it does And so where's the alternative
(19:05) Where's the spiritual alternative It's nowhere And we need to get back to this fundamental question of what even is
(19:11) misogyny Because I don't think that men kicking the crap out of each other being brutes you know insulting each other
(19:19) hazing each other even bullying each other is misogyny I not only do I not think it's misogyny I think it's
(19:24) perfectly healthy Yeah but I don't think I don't think that's well adjusted But that that is not misogyny
(19:31) Misogyn is misogyny is where you have a hatred or you know whatever you want to
(19:36) phrase it towards women It's not about men treating men Sorry Toxic masculinity is what I'm referencing here And toxic
(19:43) masculinity is what they're claiming leads to misogyny So what I'm talking about is these are all masculine traits
(19:48) There's nothing wrong with them Right When you're talking about misogyny itself I want to know what that even is
(19:55) Is it just asserting yourself to women Telling women no Telling them no That's  Okay Telling them you're saying
(20:01) stupid things Andrew Tate Andrew Tate says he's quite open about it Women should stay at home They shouldn't go
(20:07) out to work They should do what he tells them He's the king of the castle in his house Blah blah blah blah blah That is
(20:13) misogyny isn't it You know I've got a daughter I've got a 13-year-old daughter I don't want her thinking she can never
(20:19) leave the house She's somebody's somebody's chap It's not never leaving the house Look it is true that the world
(20:25) would be a better place if we didn't have it inverted and women did have a natural role at home and that that was
(20:30) glorified and that there was government propaganda around the nuclear family and keeping women home Why do you want to
(20:36) outsource the raising of children to strangers instead of your wife That that's a way better society Why do you
(20:43) want your best and brightest women uh forced to go to a workplace instead of the best and brightest women staying at
(20:50) home raising their children That's a way better system It's always been a better system I guess we're talking freedom of choice That's not women to do anything
(20:57) Fre It's freedom of choice It's freedom of choice I I want my I I love the fact
(21:02) that my wife's out there working teaching kids and building adolescence I love that I love that And to your to
(21:08) your point about what do I get from a woman I have a home I have three beautiful children I have communication
(21:15) in the house And to me that means more than anything like I don't understand where I I'm not saying you're wrong in
(21:21) your world but to to sit there and say to a woman "What do I get out of this
(21:26) woman?" That's treating her like an object One one thing I'm trying Okay So it's okay to treat men like objects Give
(21:32) them duties but you're not object duties I feel respected Okay Well let me ask you this How it is in the United States
(21:38) that men can be drafted Women can't be drafted but women can vote to send men to war 18 years old they're stabbing
(21:45) each other in the face with bayonets Women can vote to send men to war that they then themselves do not have to
(21:50) fight It's a duty that men have they do not have What's the counter duty for women There's no obligation for women to
(21:57) have children well under replacement rate It's slated 45% of women will be single in the next 10 years up to 60% in
(22:05) the next 30 That's the estimates right now Our replacement rate we can't even replace our own country's birth rates
(22:11) That's how low they are This is what we're seeing as a systemic issue inside of
(22:17) society because nobody will put duties on women Instead you just like that making
(22:23) that rate is low It's crazy to me as well that you just don't talk over each
(22:28) other Let James let James speak I can't understand why you are sat there confidently thinking of yourself as a
(22:34) victim constantly You have a platform and you're sat here like I'm a victim What are women doing for me What happened in your childhood that has made
(22:40) you so traumatized as an adult that you cannot stand women succeeding I'm so
(22:45) confus I feel like the problem is not and actually maybe this is our fault Maybe this is the left's fault Maybe
(22:51) this is um modern society's fault for leaving people like you behind But genuinely we do not hate men And toxic
(22:57) masculinity has been thrown around a lot Ultimately some of what you're saying is toxic but that's not because you're a
(23:04) man That's because you're an idiot All right Okay So so just to give you a quick rejoinder here again didn't
(23:10) contend with a single argument I made You just said "Why are you acting like a victim?" While you're here talking about how women are contending with arguments
(23:17) other wild to me It's just so wild to me I want to play this show Let me go to Tommy I Tom
(23:24) I want to play you a clip This is from a a show called News Night on the BBC in the UK where the host Victoria Darish
() 
(23:30) had a panel of young men on and asked them when was the last time you cried Let's watch this When was the last time
(23:36) you cried Honestly I the last time I I cried I
(23:41) couldn't tell you Same with Leo I can't really remember the last time that I cried fully A lot of times I feel
(23:48) emotion and I look at myself why can't I cry We're told to suppress our emotions I feel like to guys we may be treated a
(23:57) certain way that evokes an idea that we have to be extremely strong and upfront
(24:02) and here as as as a man and I'm I'm not I'm going to be composed at all times
(24:09) Now I've got a slight issue with this Tommy in the sense that one of the most devastating moments for me as a movie
(24:15) watcher was watching James Bond blingbing in the last Bond movie Right I don't think to to prove you're a modern
(24:22) man you need to be sobbing all the time You know I can't remember the last time I cried It doesn't make me less of a man
(24:29) or less empathetic to people or anything I think this again the pendulum issue of
(24:34) what we want men to be I think we're now trying to persuade a lot of young men if you're not emoting all the time this
(24:42) then you're being suppressed in some way I you know we have over here the British stiff upper lip which I think gets a
(24:48) really bad rap I think it's not a bad thing to actually not over emote Your
() 
(24:54) thoughts Yeah I I agree I think Oh sorry Sorry
(24:59) Sean I'll come to you That was for that was for Tommy I'll come to you in a minute Oh sorry Tom For Tommy Sorry
(25:05) Yeah I don't disagree with you at all peers I don't think that men should be trained to be overly emotional and that
(25:12) that should be a sign now of new maturity being emotional I don't agree with that I I don't think there's
(25:17) anything wrong with men crying in certain circumstances Listen everybody has a different journey Everybody has a
(25:23) different set of circumstances There are circumstances wherein men crying I have no issue with It's also not up to me to
(25:30) tell a man when he can or cannot cry I personally prefer the men in my life not to be overly emotional but that's just a
(25:36) personal preference really Who am I to tell a man how he should exhibit his emotions But again I think that there is
(25:43) two sides here that are both too extreme You've got the one hand that wants men to be feminine and cry and show their
(25:50) emotion and be weak And then you've got the other side that says you cannot cry You must always be strong and you should
(25:56) look at women as an object So again there's got to be a happy medium here I
(26:01) think there once was but now because of again I agree there was an overreaction
(26:07) of the feminist movement to make men weak I don't agree with that either I just wish we could come to a place where
(26:13) there was a happy medium where people could just be human beings who could have a gender role but weren't married
(26:19) to that gender role and absoluteness There's got to be a place for that I would certainly hope Yeah Andrew Wilson
(26:25) when was the last time you cried uh when I had a death uh in my family
(26:32) And how long ago was that if you don't mind me asking Uh many many many years Uh yeah many years I don't know Maybe a
(26:39) decade Something like that Right So you haven't you haven't shed a tear in a decade I don't think so No Do would do
(26:45) you see it inherently as a weakness in a man to over emote Well yeah Men listen
(26:50) you don't want men to fall to pieces in crisis You're the head of a family You're the head of your household And also you're the heads of nations You
(26:56) have a a moral obligation not to fall to pieces In fact I would say you're duty bound not to You need to be able to
(27:02) control your emotions and you need to be able to attempt to control them at all times It's not to say that you're not going to lose control Nobody's perfect
(27:08) But I think that the idea of the stoic man is a much better prospect for the idea of like this leftist that I'm
(27:14) arguing with next to me on the panel I would not want to be that guy that person who just cannot control u their
(27:22) internal emotions They can't do it And unfortunately uh again this is through the viewpoint of the feminine prism that
(27:30) uh it's only through empathy right empathy first And it's like no it's not always about empathy It's also about
(27:35) reason It's also about logic It's also about understanding that we live in a carnal world full of waring tribes who
(27:41) are always killing each other And that's part of the human condition You can't afford to have your men losing control
(27:48) to emotion or to empathy James when was the last time you you didn't cry uh on a
(27:53) date Let's flip the question around I haven't cried today but I did cry yesterday and I think it's okay to cry
(28:00) And it's funny that you keep trying to go me and saying that I don't have control of my emotions I think I have
(28:05) incredible control over my emotions because I know what's upsetting me and when and I'm able to talk about it Well
(28:13) how often do you cry I mean not all the time but every day No not every day Pers I cried or probably haven't cried for
(28:19) about 3 weeks before that But honestly my therapist tells me I need to cry And it's a good relief But the point being
(28:24) Andrew hasn't cried in that such a weakness Andrew that you haven't cried in in a decade Like that's crazy to me
(28:33) Stop me I could cry I'm so worried about you I can't understand Well you're crying now And please I happily
(28:39) facilitated that for you I think we're see I think we're seeing the two extremes that Tommy was talking about It
(28:44) is honestly Yeah Tommy you're so right There's no nuance I mean it's difficult to have nuance on this show anyway but we do need to find some in this debate I
(28:51) think the point is men should not feel they can never emote but also they shouldn't be encouraged to believe if
(28:57) they're not constantly emoting There's something wrong with them Well of course but also and that's where the pendulum's just gone too far You also you you are
(29:03) also sort of guilty of this manosphere Pierce You're very much in the manosphere yourself What do you think that means Well it means that you think
(29:09) James Bond shouldn't cry and that if he does that's a weakness I want James Bond to be I want him to seduce women I want
(29:16) him to be a ruthless steely eyed deer of death to bad guys I want him to have a
(29:21) cigarette with his whiskey or or his martini Maybe Andrew is your type And I
(29:27) don't want him sobbing like a baby all the time Like Tommy might because guess what When you're in when you're in Her
(29:32) Majesty's Secret Service you you don't have time to cry all the time Very sad news about Her Majesty Pier Sadly she
(29:37) did pass away and I'm sure you cried at that which is completely His majesty now obviously Tommy actually the last time
(29:43) the Bond the last Bond film was under her majesty So I was correct Fine Great factchecking Um Tommy would obviously
(29:50) like to go out with a man like you then because you don't think it's okay for a man to cry She has excellent taste But there are other women who do like a man
(29:57) that cries Like we're not all the same We don't all require the same type of man So it's fine if we all want to be different types of men but there
(30:03) shouldn't be one rule for all men and that's the problem All right let me bring Sean back in and and bring it back to adolescence that that because this
(30:09) series has blown up worldwide It's got incredible numbers of people watching
(30:14) talking about it debating A lot of parents thinking what should they do if they have a young teenage boy you know
(30:20) and I saw as I say with my three sons that the Jonathan hate book about uh
(30:26) cell phones you know from 2010 when phones became smartphones basically
(30:31) young people's brains started scrambling and they've carried on scrambling ever since That doesn't help I think a lot of
(30:38) a lot of the issues that young men face are driven by stuff they see on their phone
(30:46) I I agree I mean you know for this for this specific instance we my wife and I we're waiting to give our children
(30:52) phones until at least 8th grade right At least 8th grade We want to monitor what
(30:57) they're seeing and what they're being filled with right Because again they they're subject to search engines They
(31:03) hear things at school then they go home they they search it on their phone they search it in you know in their in their
(31:08) room and now they're wide open to this world that they don't need to be a part of because their brains haven't fully formed yet They're still little My my
(31:16) son's almost 12 right I got to be very careful of what he puts in his mind And
(31:22) social media for the things that we are doing as adults yeah it's pouring into
(31:27) our household and we're we're doing well with it But for an adolescent like these young kids I'm seeing kids at dinners
(31:33) when we're at restaurant surfing Tik Tok while their parents are not even paying attention to what they're doing Like
(31:40) that right there that right there is a massive problem And if we don't as a society get a hold of that then this
(31:47) will never end There will be more series like adolescence that hit even harder because we're witnessing it in our own
(31:53) lives Yeah I mean Andrew you seem to be in agreement with some of that Yeah It's I mean it's poison There's no doubt it
() 
(32:00) rescramles uh children's brains and it's very difficult to monitor even if you have parental controls that can find
(32:06) ways around it At school they have um you know peers who will assist them in getting around it You have to monitor it
(32:12) really well Um you know smartphone technology for my own kids It was kind of new Uh I wish that I in retrospect
(32:20) had done more guarding against that myself you just you don't know the dangers of that technology until uh
(32:26) children get a hold of it and then you're left scrambling going oh man I wish I had known that this was going on
(32:31) or that was going on but you have no idea now though and we have a little bit of retrospect and we know that it's it's
(32:39) an appropriate thing to do to guide against this type of technology because yeah he's absolutely right it does
(32:44) create all sorts of problems for kids I'm not sure that that gets to the heart of the masculinity and feminine issue
(32:50) but I totally agree with him that we should be safeguarding turning our children against this technology It does seem to be very bad for them And and you
(32:57) know James there is pretty well unfettered pornography on the internet available to young men and women
(33:03) obviously but you know men are watching a lot of often quite violent degrading
(33:09) sexual scenes on in these you know porn clips they're seeing on online None of
(33:15) that can help in the way they an impressionable young male mind goes about trying to forge a real
(33:21) relationship with an actual woman Well I think it's important not to say young male mind It's any person's mind right
(33:27) Like I don't think we should victimize men I can't believe Andrew is agreeing with me Um but yeah it's awful I mean I
(33:32) genuinely don't think people should have phones until they're 16 They certainly shouldn't have So well Australia's done that and I I'm not against it The
(33:38) smartphone banned till 16 I mean it's terrifying You can't go on air on TV and say whatever you want Like I know you're
(33:44) pretending that you're uncensored but you couldn't sit here and say literally whatever you want Well not really peers
(33:50) because if you said if you said something that incited hatred or racism or a terror attack be arrested but
(33:56) online why would I want to incite a terrorist saying that you want to I'm just trying to make a point online You're saying you're saying I can't say
(34:02) what I want I do not want to incite a terror attack But if you did I No but
(34:07) I'm just to be you're raising an interesting point about censorship We're uncensored because I would not want I
(34:13) don't say anything I don't want to say Right You're So when you say I'm censoring I'm actually self-censoring
(34:19) I'm not I'm not going to me I'm not saying that you would ever do that of course but I'm saying that if you did
(34:25) there would be accountability for that because you are broadcasting to a lot of people but a lot of people online do not
(34:31) have that gate stopping them from saying horrendous things And so therefore it can blow up online Excuse the horrible
(34:38) pun And that shouldn't be allowed There should be a system in place that stops people broadcasting things that aren't
(34:44) meant to be broadcast to millions of people One of the problems Tommy Toby Young who's a British uh journalist
(34:50) director of Free Speech Union very very big in in promoting and defending free
(34:56) speech as adolescence The new teen drama is pro- censorship propaganda partly
(35:01) paid for by the state that is now being seized upon by Labour leftwing MPs as
(35:06) evidence we need more online censorship Um and that is of course you know you
(35:12) talk about a swinging pendulum What you don't want to come out of all this is an overreaction and an over censorship
(35:19) because that in itself becomes a problem
(35:25) Yeah 100% And I agree with Sean on this point too I think parenting has more to do with this than any of us really you
(35:33) know can even understand Um I mean many I'm sure in this panel can but parenting
(35:38) is to me the end- all beall of all of this I mean you can watch horrible things online You can listen to people
(35:44) say horrible things but if you've got a good foundation with good parents at home hopefully two that provides you
(35:50) with a lot of guidance and support to navigate these things And it doesn't really you know scramble your mind in
(35:56) the way that those that are not blessed with a two parent household may be impacted by it I don't believe that
(36:02) censorship is ever the answer I believe that more speech is the answer to speech
(36:07) that you don't like And as much as I don't like certain people online and what they say whether they're the tape brothers or whoever else I believe that
(36:13) they should have the right and the ability to say it And then people like us should have the right and ability to
(36:18) respond to it I think that's the healthiest way to come to a great consensus or at least a public square
(36:24) where we can all debate ideas with dialogue and conversation But I don't think that censorship is ever the answer
() 
(36:31) And I think that you know our leaders in America have done a great job of emphasizing that especially to the
(36:37) European countries who believe censorship is the way to cleanse or the
(36:43) way to legislate morality I just don't think that's the way to do it Well the instinctive reaction certainly in in the
(36:49) UK for a long time now many years has been to censor and to ban and prohibit
(36:55) and so on And I think people are beginning to wake up to the the downside of that is that once you give away once
(37:01) you chip away at things like freedom of speech freedom of expression you're heading down a pretty slippery road
(37:07) which can be dictated by your government And then that that's not a place It's interesting though isn't it I mean I
(37:12) just want to make a side point and I don't need to get into it but like your government are banning books So they are
(37:17) literally talking about free speech whilst also banning free speech in it that they don't agree with So what
(37:23) you're saying is nice and I agree with you in particular what is happening not the same as banning books you talked about
(37:30) freedom of speech right and everyone coming together and having discussion about it but that's not what's happening
(37:37) yeah but not but in but but gay porn into children's libraries is a little different I mean no one
(37:43) should be putting porn into a children's library I think we all agree on that then why are you complaining that that's
(37:50) being that's not what I'm discussing I'm discussing books that talk about diversity equality that talk about Black
(37:56) Lives Matter that talk about gay pride like this is so I don't well I don't have the same take as the rest of the
(38:02) panel when it comes to the idea of legislating morality I think that there are ideas which are subversive and that
(38:08) we can get rid of and that that's absolutely fine to do I don't think that we need to have unfettered access to
(38:14) pornography I don't think that we need to have unfettered access to children being uh introduced to this type of
(38:20) sexuality so young I don't think that that's necessary at all I don't think it's an impingement on free speech at
(38:25) all And not only that there's going to necessarily be limits on every single freedom that we have by necessity That's
(38:32) the way it has to be unfortunately And the reason it has to be that way is because otherwise you're going to have
(38:38) nothing but subversives who go in and subvert your entire culture which is exactly what happened in the UK and it's
(38:43) exactly what's been happening in the United States So we have to have some way to fight back against that All right
(38:48) Uh Sean final word to you I I just I just feel like you know
(38:54) raising children is a multi-prong approach right I mean you're looking at
() 
(38:59) first in the house then you're looking at the schools you're looking at the government you're looking at extracurricular activities with coaches
(39:06) etc and different people that have their hands on the child I just think it's important to be at home having these
(39:12) open conversations right what this uh drama series did for me was already you
(39:19) know already had this shining light on a subject but made it even brighter Like I need to open the door and talk to my
(39:25) child you know I need to talk to my son I need to talk to my daughter to see what's going on in the world right
(39:31) Because if I don't know what's going on then I can't help them navigate what's going on in society But I I think you
(39:37) know it's interesting It's been a fascinating debate I just think if you don't know that your child is going down
(39:43) rabbit holes like that kid is in that series for that length of time then it comes to Tommy's point is you're failing
(39:49) your parenting That is a fundamental part of parenting is you're supposed to
(39:55) be protecting these impressionable young minds as best you can if they're spending hours after hour every day you
(40:02) know watching and viewing incredibly disturbing content that fries their brains and makes them do stuff they
(40:07) wouldn't otherwise have done You are failing as a parent And one of the biggest issues in the world right now is
(40:14) a general sense of a lack of accountability for parents They're the
(40:19) first feckless parents to blame everybody else It's the government's fault It's the police fault It's the
(40:26) social workers fault it's the school teachers fault etc etc It's never their fault And actually if you start by
(40:33) saying actually we should have done more as parents that is a good message to send everybody We could probably all
(40:38) agree on that Um great discussion Absolutely Great discussion Thank you all very much I appreciate it Thank you
