(2:19) she is a Marxist feminist debater we have a few topics and prompts for today

(2:49) heads or tails uh heads okay tail so Andrew uh do you want

(2:56) to go first or second for the opener I'll go second second okay Kenzie uh why don't uh you go ahead and go first with

(3:02) your opening statement um so are we still doing like the statement in terms of like what our

(3:09) world viiew is uh generalized opening statement and then I think we can incorporate the world view into the

() 

(3:15) opening statement okay yeah um my name is Miss Kenzie I'm a Tik Tok feminist Marxist debater uh my opening statement

(3:23) is essentially a feminist and Marxist critique on certain oppressive systems that we see not only global but

(3:30) specifically in the United States uh how they negatively affect uh women

(3:35) relationships uh society as a whole uh and the philosophy into which uh how we

(3:42) should organize as a society into what um our ultimate goal is okay Andrew what about you uh yeah so

(3:52) that was a really quick opening statement do you do you want more time or uh no or anything else okay go ahead

(3:58) I'm ready to discuss stuff all all right well my name is Andrew Wilson and uh you

(4:03) could call me a Christian populist you might refer to that as like Christian nationalist maybe though I do prefer the

(4:08) term populist um My overall Viewpoint is based around objective morality things

(4:16) like this things that aren't we not really on topic I guess for the purpose of this debate um I'm against Marxism

(4:23) definitely against feminism against all waves of feminism so I'm not one of these people who thought second wave

(4:28) third wave fourth wave or perhaps we're in fifth wave now it's not decided I don't think any of them are good and uh

(4:35) the reason that I don't I'll incorporate in my arguments and mixture of force Doctrine the understanding of the Dynamics between men and women the

(4:41) historical perspective my I have a criticism against yours uh because you're basing your worldview on

(4:48) standpoint Theory essentially and uh I'm going to critique that as well so

(4:54) overall um that's kind of what my worldview is if you wanted to dive in a

(4:59) little deeper uh into that I would say uh right-wing conservative from your

(5:05) perspective likely bordering on authoritarianism um so I am definitely

(5:12) here to oppress your views definitely here to oppress your views Cru and unfair treatment huh

(5:17) that's right definitely here to oppress your views so uh that's kind of my worldview so with that I'm actually

(5:23) happy to just kind of dive right into the debate I think one thing we we were going to do first before we get into the

() 

(5:30) open portion of the conversation was just defining a few terms and clearing

(5:35) those up so because we are discussing feminism I think just let's jumping off

(5:40) point here uh I guess Define what that is Kenzie do you have a definition for what feminism is uh yeah the movement to

(5:47) end sexist oppression and sexism okay all right and how would you define

(5:54) sexism uh biases towards uh one specific gender or sex okay gotcha and then you

(6:00) also mentioned the term oppression how do you Define oppression uh cruel or cruel and unfair treatment okay got it

(6:07) Andrew do you agree with these definitions or would you like to give your own yeah so to me when I say

(6:12) feminism I mean a movement towards egalitarianism which is trying to dism dismantle patriarchal systems okay so

(6:19) that's what I'm referencing when I say that does that sound reasonable to you

(6:24) sure okay so we can kind of agree then to that

(6:31) definition of feminism and then uh oppression would you just consider that

(6:37) basic power dynamics um yeah I mean obviously like cruel or unfair treatment can be through

(6:43) laws can be through certain uh means of production what view are you viewing for

(6:49) uh the accounting of things like cruelty like utilitarian or something like that I mean I I don't like to subscribe

(6:56) necessarily to one position uh it depends but uh utilitarian and and

(7:01) deontological positions you have a mixture of them yeah okay so like maybe threshold sure okay like threshold

(7:08) deontology something like that okay I mean it would it would depend on the the

(7:14) topic gotcha okay so cruel and unusual

(7:20) punishment all right I think we got I think we got a lot of the semantic

(7:25) if you don't mind if we have to stop from time to time to clear up semantics one thing really hate is equivocation

(7:31) the idea that we speak past each other because we're talking about two different things sure so no I think it's

(7:36) important to communicate the concept you're trying to convey yeah yeah so kind of to start with I guess um I can

(7:43) kind of open up to get this thing moving so I want to start with the idea of how feminism and Marxism aren't contrary to

() 

(7:50) each other so I've read a lot of of marxist feminist literature especially

(7:56) from duvah um and they do actually seem uh to be a contradiction so through the

(8:01) first wave feminism to modernity uh you have single-handedly

(8:06) feminism has single-handedly put more women in the hands of Rich industrialists than any other single movement which has ever existed Rich

(8:13) capitalist industrialists are now basically in charge of women uh women

(8:19) are part of the market Workforce Now they never work as part of the market Workforce they have now accured almost

(8:25) as much debt in 100 years as men which is incredible I mean it's incredible there's only a few um one of the I mean

(8:33) one of the big ones is student loans but I mean they're almost on point with everything else there's very very few um

(8:39) market indicators where they hold significantly less debt than men do uh from my understanding the only place

(8:45) where women do hold more debt is student loans men men hold more in credit cards and it's true well credit cards it could

(8:52) be that we don't know because we get it from the credit card reporting agency but it's like it's like a 2% margin so

(8:59) so maybe maybe they hold less maybe they hold I I'm not sure but it's not significant like none of these

(9:05) thresholds I look at look very significant to me so what I'm trying to figure out is Marxism and maybe we can

(9:13) clear up the semantic here too but Marxism is looking for a stateless society where yeah where capitalism is

(9:20) gone right so if capitalism is gone how is feeding Millions upon millions of women

(9:27) to the capitalist machine via feminism a good idea for Marxism that's just it

(9:33) makes no sense to me well I mean if we're talking about first W feminism I don't like to necessarily Define

(9:38) feminism um based on its wave because I think it ignores certain sexs within feminism that are outside of that as

(9:44) well as kind of puts it in a western purview uh but I I will say Obviously

(9:50) there are different uh modes of feminism that we've seen in place throughout history and I would just say this was

(9:55) liberal feminism which obviously is towards the movement of uh upward mobility within

(10:02) capitalism yeah but why would you support that I I wouldn't I I would be against the then how are you then how

(10:08) are you a feminist well what kind of feminist are you I'm Marxist intersectional feminist okay yeah Marxist intersectional but right you did

(10:16) rely on first wave second wave third wave fourth wave feminism yeah so there is progression obviously over time um

(10:23) I'm sure you have uh I I know I've heard you say that with your Christian populism your plan is three 300 years so

(10:30) obviously there's going to be different steps that you take over time I think when it comes to uh if we're going to

(10:35) talk about liberal feminism and women entering the market when it comes to economic work is that one of the ways we

(10:42) see that women have faced oppression or marginalization um or subjugation whatever term you want to use uh is

(10:50) obviously patriarchy's construction of dependency on men so but they were more liberated so men held the debt not women

(10:59) so I would argue immediately yeah no problem I would argue immediately that because women now hold

(11:07) so much debt they're less liberated than they ever have been at least in this nation so um I would point you to things

(11:14) like before they had the right to vote the 19th Amendment they were able to pass the 18th amendment that was

(11:20) literally due to the women's temperance movement and they did not have the right to vote at that time but they had so

(11:25) much moral political power uh that they were able to to past that so they they definitely had political power and they

(11:32) had no debt I don't see how this is I don't think a lot of people had debt during that time yeah men had a lot of

(11:38) debt me I mean they had all indivual debt they had all the debt um all of it

(11:43) like 1 to 2% maybe for women sure so I I mean if we're talking about like do I

(11:48) think debt is a good thing no that would be a critique against capitalism the critique that with feminism in that

(11:55) specific uh instance that you've given is

(12:00) that the only way to get access to uh the material Goods of life is is

(12:06) obviously through money and so when women are able to participate in the market then they are dependent on men um

() 

(12:13) in order to get to get housing to get food to get shelter so on and so forth or um you know they're paid very low

(12:22) wages and so I think expanding that market then creates more individual opportunities to where you don't have to

(12:28) get married uh to where you can have more autonomy in your choice yeah but this is really a weird this is a very odd position that I

(12:36) don't think Stacks up very well so if the if the idea is women need to be able

(12:41) to gain more materialism that is in conflict with Marxism which is say I agree I'm saying

(12:47) that's under capitalism that yeah but we live in capitalism sure and we did then I I understand that so so the thing is

(12:54) is like it seems very contradictory to me to say well okay

(13:00) access to material hold sorry sorry what's what's going on I was trying to turn off the that's my okay I apologize

(13:07) problem we have a new yeah no problem okay sorry go ahead go ahead just it so

(13:12) it's it's just really bizarre to me when you say women need to be able to access materialism in order to be less

(13:19) oppressed when now women are they have by the way I mean they their student

(13:24) loan debt alone is insane um they're they're now under the Yoke of capital Capal ISM more significantly than they

(13:30) ever have been because of this acement of debt so it seems like just feeding them into the system while calling it

(13:36) Liberation when Rich industrialists owned them then and own them now so I mean it's a more intersectional look at

(13:42) that like I do agree with you that capitalism in itself and like the concept of debt is oppressive so yes you

(13:48) are correct when when you say that assessment but if we're looking at the intersection what's the alternative

(13:54) under capitalism for women to be dependent on access to the basic materials seems far in way to me to be a

(14:01) way better system if you wanted to actually Institute Marxism so I'll explain why if you were to use the

(14:08) accelerationist argument which it sounds like you're trying to do move into accelerationism um that what we would

(14:15) just have fascism like that's that's what we usually end up with is sorry right-wing authoritarianism well I I

(14:20) know what you mean by fascism can you repeat your point though yeah so if the idea is women need to be moved into the

(14:27) the rich industrialist market for some reason because it's more liberating for them to have more materialism which it

(14:33) seems to be completely the opposite because more opportunity for what though to ingratiate more

(14:39) materialism uh no I would even just say like the standard means of living

(14:44) materialism I I I don't know like we need housing right is that materialism

(14:50) Yeah well yeah it is like depending on the size of the house and I mean so when you say housing what does that Encompass

(14:57) like a a commi block like a a stone commi block where like we can agree like on what basic necessities

(15:05) humans need in order to function within society and I would say housing would be definitely sure but how

(15:12) big um I I I think it would depend obviously based on need yeah right so so

(15:17) if it's if it's moving off of need right I could I would say that people need very little space okay right sure so if

(15:24) that if this is the case though introducing women into the capitalist Market right where Now Rich industrialists own

(15:32) their labor which they do in order to give them the right to vote about stuff

(15:37) that's kind of meaningless ultimately towards towards themselves what was the point of that

(15:44) for Marxism that's it's totally counter I'm not saying it's a it's a movement towards Marxism I'm saying that that's

(15:50) obviously like a liberal feminist movement which is upward mobility within capitalism so that you can have access

(15:57) to so you don't support feminism I don't support liberal feminism but that's the only type of feminism we've we've had

(16:04) here um in terms of certain movements sure I guess it would depend on how you classify certain uh movements but when

(16:11) we're talking about like capitalist critique those who think that women would find uh Liberation um having the

(16:18) same access to capitalist opportunities as men is is a liberal feminist idea but

(16:25) which well I don't understand then so do you support Western feminism or

(16:30) not um I I don't if if you want to label it as that Western feminism like well

(16:37) okay so the only feminism that I can point to is either the feminism here or

(16:42) we can talk about communist feminism but that was liberalized as well I disagree I think we can see like uh when the

(16:49) Black Panthers um in the 60s and 70s that's where womanism was born out of which is also Marxist

(16:55) theory yeah sure but it was also part of a femin movement the sexual Liberation was a big

(17:02) part of what was going on in the' 60s with black panther and female Liberation too so I'm just curious though first

(17:08) wave feminism you agree essentially fed all women into this massive capitalist

(17:15) machine whereas they did not have to participate in it before again like I I think that's a really exclusionary idea

(17:22) of first wave feminism because there were also like uh feminists who were abolitionists there were also feminists

(17:29) who were poor who wanted uh more rights for the working class and those were kind of ignored so I think if you want

(17:35) to label uh first W feminism as essentially the suffer jet movement um

(17:41) and the means to enter capitalist uh I I don't think that's all-encompassing of

(17:47) feminism first W feminism is definitely responsible for Millions upon Millions

(17:54) upon millions of women entering into the workforce under Rich capitalist industrialists single-handedly

(18:00) responsible for that okay what else would there what else would it be that would be responsible for that I think

(18:06) that's obviously what's at the the Forefront but there are other sects of feminism that we're dealing with

(18:12) abolition we're dealing with with they were never they never had any political power okay I mean we had the uh 192

(18:20) Lawrence textile strike which was about working conditions yeah but feminists have always moved towards working but

(18:26) this is the problem again working conditions for what to capitalism the work at capitalist plants I I guess I'm

(18:32) not sure like what what your overarching question my overarching point is why would you support first if you don't

(18:38) support first wave feminism because it fed Millions upon millions of women into

(18:43) the pocket in the pocket of Rich industrialists which it did and you agree it did and the second wave did and

(18:50) the third wave and now even the fourth wave none of these feminist waves are anti- capitalists no I agree so you

(18:58) don't support any of that though right if we're going to have a critique of capitalism I think we can have ways that

(19:05) we can see how women can be more liberated not critiquing capitalism I'm critiquing the view of feminism right

(19:11) but obviously if we're going to talk about capitalism that those are intertwined so if we're not going to abolish the system how can women

(19:18) participate within capitalism that would give them opportunity or more Liberation I agree with you liation is not possible

(19:25) under capitalism well I would argue then that if this is the case you're looking for more Liberation I would say that

(19:31) they're more liberated when they can't ACR debt and they couldn't acre debt only the man could ACR debt and only the

(19:38) man who was married philosophy then are men oppressed yes okay yes men are very okay

() 

(19:45) then then I guess we don't disagree so I got to ask I got to ask um I wouldn't say for the same reasons you would but

(19:51) the question becomes is it the case that you think that women are more or less

(19:57) oppressed by cap ISM now than they were when they were dependent on their husbands um well obviously capitalism

(20:05) has taken different form uh so it it would depend on essentially what metric

(20:10) we're evaluating they have more access to education which I would see would be less oppressive obviously the stressors

(20:16) of more oppressive education's oppressive way more oppressive to women well educated what what's the what's the

(20:23) only type of debt women have that outnumbers men I again that's just because of just answer the question

(20:29) student so so the idea of the education right which is mostly the it's not like

(20:36) it's most of these are stem degrees they're not I mean if education were free would you say that they're being oppressed education is free up until

(20:43) College age I know I'm I'm just asking are we talking about the idea of Education itself or the fact that it's

(20:48) so expensive no we're talking about Liberation from oppression and so what I'm arguing to you so when you say

(20:55) education is oppressive is that because under capitalis is M of the cost that

(21:00) obviously debt is burdensome or just a woman being educated is oppressive now I would say that the acement of student

(21:09) debt mostly being in the hands of women has done more to oppress them than if

(21:14) they had not gone to college in the first place then if that if that had been barred that's not my question what

(21:21) okay but what's your question then my question is you're not saying education is oppressive you're saying either going

(21:27) into debt or the uh Society making a profit off education obviously puts

(21:32) burdens on the person who's taking loans out yes we don't disagree with that I I don't disagree but why are we selecting

(21:38) for that then what do you mean well I mean you say that women need to be educated institutions are going to

(21:44) require capital in order to educate so right so if again we're going

(21:49) to um e education has definitely benefited women in terms of having the

(21:56) equal access to capitalism to to certain aspects of

(22:02) society uh that would give them more opportunity and uh more identity it has

(22:08) literally LED them to being Pawns in capitalism y just like men yeah so the

(22:13) thing is is I mean if you think how is that but how is that less or more less oppressive it's way more oppressive so I

(22:20) this is what I I say choice and individuality so if we're talking about certain social ideas yeah let's walk

(22:26) through it logically right so we start start with women can't acrw no debt only their husbands can acrw debt that's it

(22:33) only the husbands were able to acrew debt but then they're educated correct I no they could still be educated how they

(22:39) would go to school where well they had public school which available by the way women have

(22:45) always done better in public school and then College was also available to them most of your feminist first W feminist leaders went to school they went to

(22:51) college right but but College was also free then no it wasn't free yeah it was where in the United States where

(22:59) like what specific College I think uh Berkeley was free up until the 60s until

(23:04) uh okay so when you're talking about college fees it's important to understand that

(23:10) if it is the case that you want everybody to do a thing you're going to have to have a lot of that thing for them to be able to do it so when you're

(23:16) talking about education specifically it used to be about rewarding the best and brightest it is not about rewarding the best and brightest now there's lots and

(23:22) lots and lots of people who go and get a college degree and it's the equivalent of like a 10th grade education nth grade

(23:28) educ so if that's the case right all we're doing really is just lowering the standard anyway right lowering the

(23:35) standard and then telling women that they need to go and use their birthing years in college which makes no sense to

(23:40) me it's very silly you take the reproductive years you say go spend the reproductive years in school so that you

(23:46) can be part of this capitalist machine that's very strange to me that that's your advocation a Marxist

(23:53) feminist um I mean obviously if we're talking about the ideal situation thenen

(23:58) women would have access to education without having to go into debt that's not well okay how what do

(24:06) you mean how yeah how so we should pay for for everybody's College well

(24:12) obviously if we're going to live under a capitalist Society like this at the center of that is going to be profit

(24:20) so I I I just think that's an ineffective way to organize Society because then it's obviously putting

(24:27) profit over people so we this is circular now so we start with capitalism is bad M liberate women so they can

(24:33) participate in capitalism capitalism's bad liberate women so that they can become part of

(24:38) the capitalist machine no so if we're going to talk about how women can have more opportunity and indivi individuality over cap in capitalism

(24:45) that's one argument and then talking about how women can be fully liberated from the

(24:51) constraints of capitalism is a different argument well okay let's talk if you

(24:57) want to dice them up I'm willing to like dice arguments up as small as you want to make them or as large as you want to

(25:02) make them so we can go as granular as want I'm just saying it's two different Lanes you be to can be combining it as

(25:08) one okay but what's the goal of Marxism stateless society right yeah how is I

() 

(25:14) still don't understand how throwing women into the big capitalist machine as

(25:19) a form of Liberation helps get us to that it doesn't then why would you I

(25:25) still then I still confused why you support those things um um I mean I don't support necessarily like what

(25:31) you're specifically saying if if I had my like how do we transition from

(25:36) capitalism to Communism is is a different uh argument than how can women

(25:43) uh suffer less oppression under capitalism yeah but if you don't agree with those things and first wave

(25:48) feminism was about Liberation to participate in capitalism then you don't support first wave feminism I again I

(25:54) don't like classifying feminism in terms of those waves because it just reduces it down to the singular idea where there

(26:00) are multiple sects of ideas so yes if you want me to say I don't agree I don't what are the prominent ideas then sure

(26:06) the prominent ideas were definitely I don't agree yeah so then you want me to say so then I don't know that you're a

(26:12) feminist at all just a Marxist well I mean have you heard of turfs yeah uh

(26:17) would you say that's a form of feminism it's very traditional form of feminism yeah I'm not a Turf so does that mean I'm not a feminist I I feel this is like

(26:25) no true Scotsman fallacy no I well I have to say there are prominent sex of

(26:31) feminism right yeah you have radical feminism liberal feminism intersectional

(26:36) Marx Marxist yeah so I'm saying all of them are basing it around the liberation

(26:41) of women just the different ideas around the basis of liberation of women there's

(26:46) capitalism which I'm sure we could Define and say there's different capitalism yeah so first wave feminism

(26:52) definitely wanted to liberate women so that they could have their own assets and go to work correct there's no if

(26:59) answer butts about that I I I mean go to work like women have always worked

(27:05) especially poor and uh women of color so I think like going to work is kind of uh

(27:10) maybe like a white- centered notion uh I I will acknowledge that I think in the

(27:15) early 1900s we had about 20% of women in the workforce and then by like 1950 I think it was close to 50 mhm um

(27:23) especially you had the postor War II people who were staying in the workforce sure exactly but depend you're counting

(27:28) as well definitely first W feminism was responsible for this so the thing is is I I guess when you're talking about

(27:36) Marxist feminism specifically you would have to kind of hate first- W feminism

(27:41) because it in a lot of Notions I do because I do think it ignored the material conditions of uh poor women

(27:47) women of color so yeah I don't disagree okay just I'm sure you you support capitalism right mhm do you like social

(27:55) democracy uh well I'm not sure that that's contingent on capitalism that is a capitalist uh mode just like a

(28:02) a la Fair uh free market would be there's different ways that capitalism can be structured and you can agree with

(28:07) one yeah but capitalism is an economic system it's not as much of a as I'm just

(28:13) showing how an idea can have different theory behind it yeah I'm not but I'm not disputing that I'm talking about the

(28:18) prominence of the ideas themselves sure I guess if I must not have understood no I I don't agree with some of the um

(28:26) modes that uh liberal feminism or first W feminism if you as you've called it have used so then wouldn't you agree

(28:33) with me then that it actually would have been more liberating for women to not

(28:38) have participated in first- wave feminism but instead relied on their husbands wouldn't that have actually been more liberating than sacrificing

(28:45) them to the sacrificial lamb of capitalism which is worse I don't know

(28:53) um I I there there's just so many metrics that you can

(28:58) evaluate um when it well this is the metric we're evaluating so the metric we're evaluating is my argument is if

(29:04) women are dependent on their husbands and acre no debt only the husband can acre debt but women can still own assets

(29:10) which they could and they can still own property which they could even if they were married right but you're forcing a

(29:16) woman to link arms with a man so if she's single does she have access to these things toing her to work does she

(29:21) have these things yeah they still yes of course how would you have these things how would

(29:27) they not have them they were able to own property even unmarried um that's always been the

() 

(29:32) history of the United States right but obviously then you would need to be in the workforce correct because you need to purchase it no you wouldn't need to

(29:38) purchase it often times your your father would give it to you oh so just through again like generational wealth which

(29:46) which by the way first W feminism destroyed a lot of that too a lot of cross-generational wealth but women

(29:51) could own property sure um I mean I I would say like why why would I have have

(29:58) to pick one uh because your choice is either you go to work right you're either want

(30:06) equality or you don't want equality so if the idea is I want equality and that's I I think it would be more

(30:11) beneficial for women not to be dependent on men and to have more to work within the capitalist

(30:18) system uh yes why because they would have more control uh autonomy and

(30:24) identity they don't seem to have more control over either of or any of those things example uh the identity of woman

() 

(30:32) now in modernity is in question period what do you mean what is a woman oh

(30:38) we're going there now well you just said women would have more identity because

(30:43) identity in terms of if you're going to be dependent on um a husband then your

(30:49) your labor uh is predetermined for you your identity in terms of being a wife and mother is predetermined for you yeah

(30:56) but the beneficiaries of that is that your crew of debt is also non-existent and so you can never be it's nonexist

(31:03) because your husband has it as well so I mean there is still capitalistic thre you were not ever responsible for your

(31:08) husband's debt I but you still suffer the outcomes if it doesn't work out right yeah but you suffer the outcomes

(31:15) of that now under Capal you would have more control and autonomy right like you're your own seing ship or you're

(31:22) you're just kind of a passenger on the Titanic like you use these words these kind of buzzword right uh you say they

(31:28) have more autonomy how do women have more autonomy self-determination through Choice what choices which ones uh

(31:36) essentially how they want to experience their life do they want to get married do they want to have children they had

(31:41) the option to do that before they didn't have to get married most of the time women who didn't get married stayed at home with their parents by the way right

(31:48) now most women who don't get married they often stay at home with their parents not a lot has changed in that

(31:53) department I mean I I I haven't read any statistics that women who don't get married just stay home with their

(31:59) parents yes it's often the case that women who do not get married stay at home with their parents uh yeah it's

(32:06) often it was often true with men I think single women home purchases are starting to outpace men it's true yeah yeah but

(32:12) it is they're getting their own they're getting their own house sometimes sometimes but you got to

(32:19) remember now children are staying at home with their parents longer than so obviously like the conditions that comes

(32:25) to capitalism now is different than it was you know in the 1900s yeah so I mean the thing is is that I don't see how women

(32:32) actually have any more of these things I don't see how they have any more autonomy I don't see how they have any more actual Choice it just seems like an

(32:39) illusion of choice um I would agree with you there is some oppression within that choice

(32:45) but I do think the choice is more okay and it's worth it to have this limited amount of autonomy in order to

(32:52) grind yourself in the capitalist system like if you were to ask the average woman if you were to go back in time m

(32:58) hypothetically and you were to sit down with first wave feminist okay uh who

(33:03) couldn't seem to get first wve feminism passed any other way than an amendment because women were voting it down all

(33:09) over the place the question becomes if you ask them if we fast forwarded this

(33:15) to 100 years I just want to let you know that your children will be living at home with you until they're 25 uh you

(33:21) will be you will have access to college but you'll have crushing debt and chances are your marriage is going to fail chance are really good that your

(33:29) marriage is going to fail over 50% perhaps that your marriage is going to fail um but you'll have a little tiny

(33:36) bit more autonomy but I won't even be able to exactly tell you how you have more of it do you think that they would

(33:42) go for that deal or if you said hang on or if you said to them if you don't do this your husbands will acrew all debt

(33:49) you'll never have to worry about it again and you can still make moral claims and they'll be super effective just like the temperance movement was

(33:56) because now you're not political Pawns um I mean I think you're kind

(34:02) of constructing the options in a way that would be beneficial to to a

(34:08) specific narrative um I think I have cleared how you have autonomy like would

(34:14) you want men to be dependent on women in and have women be the predominant mode of production under capitalism I don't

() 

(34:20) think it's possible but would you want that well I I couldn't want a thing I don't think is

(34:25) possible why because it's not possible well I mean why is it not possible it's not possible because women are not

(34:31) capable of doing the same types of things that men are capable of doing such as inside of society enforcement

(34:37) enforcement M so like police and not military military military police

(34:45) speci I don't think men really are capable of that I mean that men have gone and

(34:50) fought Global Wars time and time again and one yeah and what outcomes do they have they win the war uh they they

(34:57) suffer severe PST they have a hard time integrating into society I mean that

(35:03) doesn't seem like a natural condition for for men to to be subjected to there can be symptoms of violence but remember

(35:09) not everybody gets P PTSD even combat veterans a lot of them don't have PTSD

(35:14) some get PTSD right but not only that that's a coping mechanism it's going to be individualistic men are definitely

(35:20) capable of exem an outcome of EXT of being exposed to extreme violence I I

(35:25) could say that about about women you can but the problem when it comes down to enforcement is that women can't do

(35:31) enforcement what do you mean so I'll give you the um the easy hypothetical

(35:37) okay if all men tomorrow decide that women in the United States are slaves are women in the United States

(35:43) [Music] slaves um no no no why wouldn't they be

(35:50) I think it would be a I mean how could how could women how could women stop it

(35:55) I mean it would just depend essentially on um like access to resources yeah men have the access to

(36:02) all the resources because they made you slaves well you're like that's how women could like

(36:09) stop it it would just be a fight over resources how come women can't stop it in Islamic Nations and when they just go

(36:15) okay you're all obviously in Islamic Nations they don't have access to specific resources nobody has access to

(36:22) resources if men don't don't allow access to those resources nobody because men have a monopoly on Force that's

(36:29) feminist Theory feminists understand even Marxist feminists know this that men have a monopoly on Force so in other

(36:36) words if men collectively under patriarchy I agree no under any AR Archy they're going to need to have men as

(36:42) their Monopoly on Force I'll give you an example if tomorrow uh men decided to

(36:47) enslave all women all women would be enslaved however if tomorrow all women decided to enslave all men they do not

(36:54) have the force Doctrine and requisite necessary to do so they could not do it they just couldn't

(37:00) do it within any context no so if women had access to all the drones if women

(37:06) had access to all the Water Supplies if women had access sorry women had access to I mean women can have the capacity to

(37:14) repair I don't understand like they okay so here's what I would

(37:19) say let's let's do this experiment this way if women had access to all of the

(37:24) firearms on Earth that exist okay and every weapon which exists and they have

(37:30) access to all of that they still don't have the requisite brute force that would be necessary to keep men under

(37:35) control they just wouldn't it wouldn't be possible to do long term what do you mean shortterm

(37:41) what do you mean like by brute force that they just be able to pull the trigger men no that men are much much

(37:47) much stronger and that guns guns are only an equalizer until men take your guns right and obviously they would have

(37:52) to get close enough but I mean I don't care how strong you are if you don't have water and food what you simple then

(37:58) do you think that if you if you were the head of a prison would you rather have all male or all female guards if you

(38:04) were dealing with dangerous prisoners even if both had access to guns

(38:10) um I mean I guess it would depend what the what the goal is I think to keep the prisoners who are dangerous under

(38:16) control I mean I think women can make really great police officers because they are less likely to use excessive

(38:22) force they're more likely to uh deescalate or men are more likely to escalate more likely to get disarmed

(38:28) more likely to get beaten up more likely to accidentally shoot a suspect they're more likely to do all sorts of things to

(38:34) the contrary as well but there's also way fewer females who are in the police

(38:39) force because they can't meet the minimum requirements which are necessary to be a cop they can't meet the

(38:45) necessary minimum physical requirements same thing in the military they can't meet the necessary minimum physical requirements to be in the Infantry most

(38:52) women can't do it right so men have a monopoly on force and because of force Doctrine this ends up coming down to

(38:58) this idea if it is the case you say that women can do anything that men can do I

(39:04) counter this by saying they cannot they cannot do enforcement this is uniquely a male thing there are some women who can

(39:11) be introduced who can meet these standards but on average they can't well I think the you know if um we're like to

(39:17) kind of bring it to an analogy um you know if the the fence is 6 ft tall and most women are 5'8 then

(39:26) yeah of course they're not going to be able to meet that standard so is the standard just specific to certain male

(39:32) criteria that well it would be the criteria of you need to handle a male so if you're a female police

(39:39) officer you need to be able to handle a male right um yeah but obviously like you

(39:45) have tools to Aid in that that's what I'm saying like just because women aren't meeting these criteria you get

(39:50) close to a male when you're a police officer as a female in order to put like handcuffs on them stuff like that yeah

(39:55) but you have like pepper St and stun guns yeah and routinely women get disarmed and they're routinely

(40:00) overpowered by suspects routinely happens often and sure and Men often use

(40:07) excessive force and then they're sued yeah maybe people when you say men use excessive force you're just

(40:13) demonstrating my point that men have a monopoly on Force yes maybe it's excessive but they're capable of using

(40:19) it use Force sure no no no they're just better at using Force CU they're much stronger they're much stronger they have

(40:25) much denser bones so they're much more disagree with that the average male is is stronger sure well well significantly

(40:33) stronger it's not it's not an insignificant amount between the average male and average female now I want this

(40:38) point to drive home because it's often stated like oh yeah there's this small marginal difference no it's a

(40:44) significant difference 60 70% in many cases okay much much much stronger this

(40:50) being the case men have the complete Monopoly on Force Doctrine because

(40:55) they're much much much stronger just raw Brute Force which if you reduce if you

(41:00) reduce rights you reduce Society reduce everything to it's Rod's principle it's

(41:06) going to be Brute Force I want to make you do thing I always have this Ian I I don't like agree because with violence

(41:13) there can definitely come consequences that are not desirable um in terms of the outcome like I If men wanted women

() 

(41:21) to be slaves you know who determines if the species goes on men women no men if you were slaves

(41:30) how the same way they did in Rome they impregnated their slaves well I mean but women could just

(41:36) commit suicide yeah why didn't they in Rome well that wouldn't that just be um

(41:41) Black Swan fallacy just because there's that one example where they didn't think to specific degree here we'll give you

(41:47) every example they didn't do it under gen ishan they didn't do it in again a Blacky so but I mean that's not a Black

(41:53) Swan fallacy by the way but that how how' it not be you we just haven't seen it so therefore it can't it can't happen

(41:59) Okay so first of all what I'm saying is I'm pointing to a historic standard and saying the historic standard and I asked

(42:06) you a question I didn't make a propositional statement so that's why I can't be F lacious but I would say that

(42:12) ultimately it does come down to women if she doesn't want to sustain pregnancy and is a slave she does obviously have

(42:18) the opportunity to kill herself you can't you can't have Society continue I will say that that I so I'll Grant this

(42:24) it is logically possible that all women who are slaved can off themselves not disputing that right however it's also

(42:31) logically possible they do not right sure okay which one do you think is more likely thenan it it would depend on so

(42:39) many different conditions and cont that's fair so give me a single condition in which the female slaves of

(42:45) all of history have ever collectively offed themselves in order to prevent their own slavery well it wouldn't be to prevent

(42:51) their own slavery it would be essentially to to stop the um you know the Next Generation and even if you that

(42:58) would be preventing slavery sure and even if you do have women who um are enslaved um can you give me an example

(43:04) of a because there there isn't there isn't any there's no example but I'm sure you wouldn't say that that's moral

(43:11) that's what men ought to do well I believe in objective morality I can I'll

(43:18) make a claims based on an unchanging standard but you're a moral relativist you you can't be like you can't do that

() 

(43:24) it's relative it's totally relative so is one set of morals of more value

(43:30) than another set of morals um I think morale like there are moral facts if that's what you're asking

(43:35) me no that's not what I'm asking you I'm asking you if one set of moral particulars has more value than another

(43:42) set of moral particulars um I'm not sure how to

(43:47) answer well I would just need to know if so okay for instance we have one Society

(43:54) over here that murders women and a society over here that does not murder women okay okay can you point to

(44:00) something objective that makes the society murdering women there's there's some like moral claim that you can make

(44:06) which is objective for why that's wrong well I mean Murder By definition is

(44:12) wrong no why why would it the unjustified yeah mean yeah unjustified

(44:20) doesn't mean immoral well it means wrong if it's not just then it's unjust which would be wrong okay we'll rephrase that

(44:28) they set the conditionals for something you would consider to be murder and say it isn't it's the Justified killing of

(44:35) this group of people here you consider it murder what makes their moral facts

(44:41) wrong um I mean obviously it would depend on on reason and

(44:47) context so you can with reason and context determine which moral facts are

(44:53) correct um I think you can have certain observations when it comes to the

(44:58) outcomes um I mean that would be consequentialism I think there can be Moral Moral facts in terms of there are

(45:05) things that are always wrong regardless of context like uh like rape why would that

(45:11) always be wrong uh well rape would always be wrong gra

(45:18) let say oh I'm sorry yes that was right uh grape would always be wrong because it would uh because of the harm that it

(45:23) causes yeah why is harm wrong um because harm is I mean again I would say harm by

(45:30) definition is wrong uh because it is an undesirable outcome

(45:36) within our subjective experience okay so are all undesirable outcomes

(45:41) immoral no okay well then that then you just contradicted your

(45:47) position um sure so then you can't point to a set of

(45:52) particulars which are I think then again that would be kind of um you know based

(45:59) on obviously the scale of harm I think if there's a certain degree it wouldn't matter that a if if it is the case that

(46:07) nothing which is against your subjective experience that you consider harmful uh is bad except by your own experience

(46:15) then you just just back to relativism like yeah you're never going to get past relativism so I don't really know how

(46:21) you can make the claim that this is worse than that but if you do right I'm just willing to grant that you have a

(46:26) principle and will'll adhere to the principle for the purpose of the debate so we don't bog it down with relativism

(46:32) versus non- relativism we'll kind of just give you the out there because there's no reason to to stay on it but

(46:37) back to this idea of of um let's see right before that

(46:44) when we were we were diving into yeah force and force Doctrine MH yeah so I

(46:50) would say that might makes not saying right I'm not going to make the claim that it makes right but it does make and

(46:56) so I think that Force Doctrine is the necessary requisite for rights it's the necessary requisite to have a nation

() 

(47:02) it's the necessary requisite to have anything it's Force um I I disagree because we could um obviously agree on

(47:09) rights and have a uh Cooperative we could agree on rights and

(47:14) then if somebody violates the rights what do we use um I I mean I would be more towards

(47:23) restorative justice uh as well as obviously centering the that the victim causes both of those require

(47:30) Force um I I I can agree to some extent but I

(47:35) don't think necessarily if rights if rights violations happen that what the punishment or what the outcomes is is

(47:42) what one would deem Justice I would say the conditions to which society is to

(47:47) prevent harm would be the ultimate goal that would require

(47:54) Force how because if somebody violates any of your principles or any of your

(47:59) rights how how do you get them to not do that well OB I think rights violations

(48:06) happen for specific reasons within Society like if if you were to say if I you were to say that you violated my

(48:13) rights by coming in my house and stealing all my stuff then um if we're in a society of capitalism to where

(48:19) people are subjected to to poverty and need access to material Goods okay let's say we have communism communism can't

(48:25) exist without Force it's impossible well that but that's again

(48:31) like an example of how we would prevent rights violations because I would say like if the right is violated did you

(48:39) really have it to begin with yeah but you're baking into your hypothetical here oh you violated my right and now we

(48:45) have done and you did it based on some conditional of um some externality that

(48:53) drove you to this sure right mhm forget that right they just [ __ ] want to

(48:59) they just want to I I think that's just a a lazy presupposition that people just want to

(49:05) do things yeah to just want to cause harm Psychopaths don't exist sociopaths

(49:11) narcissists these people don't exist or they do I mean they they do exist but again we're talking about what conditions they exist under and those

(49:17) are very rare okay I'll even grant that it's rare yeah I'll even gr it's where can you but I don't think people are

(49:23) born Psychopaths or sociopaths again I would say those are environmental

(49:28) conditions okay like what nourishment uh well no your brain is a

(49:34) is a social organ and so it responds to your environment I think they did a study where they analyzed I forget how

(49:41) many uh serial killers brains but um or serial and alivers uh but they all had

(49:48) uh severe damage to the orbital region um well I'd like to take a look

(49:53) at the the data there but was was there meta analysis done on it um I can't

(49:59) remember if it was a meta analysis I want to say it was but well in any case it doesn't really

(50:04) matter ultimately all doesn't matter what Society you live in it's going to there's going to be a prerequisite

(50:10) requirement for Force no matter what doesn't matter how like could you even give me in a society in which that would

(50:16) not be the case um I mean it's hard to

(50:21) conceptualize in terms of I think if we had a society based on technology

(50:27) um what do you mean by force are we just talking about like if you have a society in which people have any sort of if you

(50:34) have any sort of laws or you have any sort of rights at all then well I agree

(50:40) with that laws like laws do yeah the only thing which would create a prevention of the violation of said

(50:47) Thing by a person would be the requirement of force so if I want I mean I don't know

(50:54) how Force prevents rights violations necessarily in it's the only thing that prevents rights violations well if you

(51:01) were saying men have the Monopoly on force and that's instilled within patriarchy then why do rights violations

(51:06) occur well no that doesn't even follow it would just follow that men are the only ones who could stop rights

(51:14) violations I mean at least in Mass um okay yeah that's that's the only

(51:20) thing that would follow from that it's like men are the ones in Mass who would stop rights violations which is which is

(51:25) what exactly what happens right now know they are the ones in Mass who stop rights violations um I I think when we

(51:32) when we talk about that too like obviously um The Entity that is in

(51:38) control of forces also can commit rights violations sure so um don't disagree at

(51:44) all okay totally agree so I I don't think that the way to society and

(51:50) essentially to establish rights is necessarily through Force the only way it can be well what happens if you

(51:55) violate somebody's rights then um I mean what do you mean what

(52:01) happens well how do you stop them from doing that well they already did it what do you mean how do you stop them well

(52:08) okay so I want to take over your country right are you are you just going to let me walk in and do that or well I mean

(52:14) why and and again like do you really have like the modes of Productions and the

(52:20) materal I just don't think people wake up and just say I feel like doing this there's do you feel like Grapist rap up

(52:25) and wake up and feel like graping wake up and feel like graping uh

(52:31) today is the day no no no no so again I'm trying to I'm trying I'm

(52:39) actually really confused now I think instances sure where grape can be premeditated if we didn't enforce our

(52:46) laws do are you saying people would break them more or less if we didn't enforce our laws would people break them

(52:52) more or less I think it would depend on the law any law I mean do you Mur do you

(52:57) not murder or I'm sorry do you not murder because it's illegal there's probably a lot of people that I'd like

(53:02) to it was legal I'm just asking Mur is fine by the way you so like um I you and

(53:09) I would have do you murder do you not murder because it's illegal you and I would have a distinction um in what we would consider

(53:15) murder to be right you and I would have a distinction in that so like well I

(53:21) thought we agreed it's unjust killing yeah but what we consider Justified to be would be different okay so that would

(53:27) be where we would have a semantic distinction there right so uh for instance if somebody was hang on I'll

(53:33) explain someone is stealing property M do are you entitled to kill them um I mean per the law sure but no

(53:42) but do you think morally oh morally yeah um like somebody's taking off with your

(53:47) TV oh no yeah see I think dead right so you see we have a distinction in justification sure so you think that

(53:54) that's that's murder I think ah no it's not so to answer your question yeah if the law wasn't there to say you can't

() 

(54:01) shoot if you're stealing your TV so you would shoot someone who is stealing your TV yeah in the face in the face multiple

(54:08) times multiple times yes that's a with the newsy that's a crazy way place to plant your flag an Uzi yeah or you know

(54:16) whatever was convenient yeah what what's wrong with

(54:22) that um I I would say that the loss of their

(54:28) life certainly outweighs your your TV uh well I mean if the TV didn't like

(54:34) outweigh their ability to run I probably would have missed right but the thing is is you know what else would have prevented this them not stealing my TV

(54:42) that that's true is the is the context here this is a home invasion yeah like

(54:47) it's in your house yeah well no I think I think you can I think you have the ability to defend your property yeah and

(54:54) that your property your property anything that within the domain of on your physical property right meaning

(55:00) property you own I consider that all to be the French word curtilage and anything within the Viewpoint of

(55:06) curtilage is a violation of your actual property and therefore rights violation

(55:12) you have every right to put that person down so that you don't encourage additional people to do it so in many

(55:20) ways I think you're defending you're defending uh not just yourself but everybody around you if more people took

(55:27) that stance um I think we would I think like the better solution would be to

(55:32) recognize why someone's stealing your TV okay yeah so but how does that prevent them from doing it so like okay

(55:41) we're investigating it now by the way we've been investigating why people steal [ __ ] for about a hundred years and

(55:47) you know what we haven't really prevented people from stealing [ __ ] but I'll just grant you that we could

(55:53) scarcity though I'll just grante you that we could we no no people steal even when there's no scarcity Bernie made off

(55:59) took off with how many people's pensions there was no scarcity for well I think capitalism creates scarcity even when there's abundance that you know it's

(56:06) never enough you're going to sounds like a c so like Bernie made off who had everything just needed more uh yeah like how how many rich

(56:13) people have clearly enough money to uh live the rest of their life not have to work but still work yeah and how many

(56:19) women right who are living middle class Lifestyles steal for fun they literally

(56:25) will steal things for fun cuz it gives them a thrill sure you know and it's like so there there could just be the

(56:31) example of greed and the example of I want to do this thing cuz I really like doing it and it's like I I think there's

(56:37) a specific reason behind certain psychological uh habits or um impulses

(56:43) if you will sure but you can't cure The Human Condition You Can't how do you know that's the Human Condition though

(56:48) because we've been dealing with greed and we've been dealing with these problems at least in the 20th 21st

(56:53) century with the marching of science um we have not been able to just

(56:59) increase people's material uh positions in life and then crime suddenly goes away that element will always be there

(57:06) now I think you can reduce it yeah not saying you can't reduce it like people in abject poverty do commit crime more

(57:13) not saying that that's not the case sure what I am saying though is that in the interum time while you're trying to solve it it doesn't change the fact this

(57:19) guy has my TV I I never said it did yeah and so I

(57:24) see that as complet justified in blowing his face right off I disagree why yeah but why though I again I would say the

(57:32) life has more more value than the TV okay let's see if you actually believe

(57:37) that okay this would necessarily entail that his life had more value than any of

(57:42) your property what do you mean well I mean you're not going to put a number on his

(57:48) life right his life's worth more than all the money in the world isn't

(57:54) it um it's a man woman oh then yes yeah fair enough

(58:02) so this chick who wants to steal my TV why can't she steal my house how would you steal someone's house you squat

(58:10) squatters mhm yeah and now you've stolen my house and you've put me and my family on the

(58:15) street can I blow you away then um can you

(58:22) or should ought you morally be able to then uh I I would say that housing

(58:27) because obviously it affects the um outcomes of your family's well-being or their own Survival would be would be

(58:33) just your position here is inconsistent you just said that property property itself it's not it's not the property

(58:39) itself if you had another house to go to go to that house so so wait so if I had

(58:44) two properties they could chase me out of one of them cuz I had someplace else to go I don't think you should kill them

(58:52) but I can't kill them if they're chasing me out of the one place I have to go well I I I would say um if that's is

(58:58) that the only solution I I mean or you could call law enforcement and then they potentially

(59:04) kill them trying to arrest them or whatever I'm just asking you if that's is that the only solution well I mean

(59:09) right now I think that the well just in your hypothetical I mean oh and within the the confines the hypothetical no you

(59:15) can have different solutions right um then then obviously I would opt for different solutions I mean why would

(59:21) they want your house uh who knows they squat in people's houses don't have houses no I think a lot of I think a lot

(59:29) of times people do have access to housing they don't want to work and they squat inside of people's houses because

(59:35) it's free um again I I just think that's like a capitalist assessment of human

(59:42) behavior um as somehow Being Human Nature yeah but this doesn't really

(59:48) answer my question about why it is that I can't kill them for taking my TV it's

(59:53) mine I agree yeah why can't so if you take my [ __ ] I kill because it's taking

(1:00:00) away from my kids right if you take away well if you take my my TV I have to replace it right sure that's going to

(1:00:07) cost me money sure that necessarily takes food and resource away from my children right um yeah sure yeah so then

(1:00:14) necessarily what you're actually doing when you steal my TV is you're I think it would just be to depending on the

(1:00:21) degree yeah you're well well you're taking things from my children right and so the thing is is my potentially sure

(1:00:27) not potentially if I have to replace the TV and I have to replace the TV with my money that's goings instead of you know

(1:00:34) buying beer that week you buy the TV okay so so um let's say your budget is set in

(1:00:42) such a way where you only have X amount of money per week like most American families sure yeah so then then you're

(1:00:49) still taking money away from my kids right if I mean if you decide to replace the TV I I don't know I if if I couldn't if

(1:00:56) it were between food for my child and a TV I would probably do food for my child yeah sure but the the thing is is now

(1:01:02) you have to allocate funds away from your children so any dollar you take any

(1:01:07) dollar you take from me regardless of what I normally would have spend it on is taking money away from my kids necessarily possibly sure yeah so the

(1:01:15) thing is is like if you take from my kids I kill you problem is it seems

(1:01:20) reasonable to me it's within the confines of Reason logically Stacks up I I don't think so I think that would just

(1:01:25) be depending on degree why does it depend on the degree

(1:01:31) if you don't steal [ __ ] you don't get shot it's simple like what's the degree I mean what what if uh what if they were

(1:01:38) stealing food would would that be an issue for you yeah yeah yeah I think a

(1:01:44) person has a right to defend their food um I mean would you find it more Justified if someone is like would you

(1:01:51) steal food to feed your children possibly but do I think a person not

(1:01:56) justified in doing something about that I think they

(1:02:01) are I'm not saying they're not justified in doing something about that I'm saying like obviously the reaction

(1:02:08) to can I see myself doing a bad thing on behalf of my children yeah sure but that

(1:02:14) doesn't mean that I within the confines of Reason don't understand that a person can't do something about that it's like

() 

(1:02:20) you can't say I'm not saying that you know you you can do nothing I think you could try and take the TV back back you

(1:02:26) know punch them in the face well that's dangerous sure they could punch you back yeah so it's shooting them they could shoot at you back usually if you shoot

(1:02:33) at somebody I don't know how say my Situation's dangerous but yours isn't if somebody's running with your TV and

(1:02:39) you're shooting at them I don't think they're going to be shooting back they're very skilled they're going to

(1:02:45) hold the TV like this and grab I mean they're thin yeah you can use one arm and you know you don't think that's like

(1:02:51) moderately deranged I don't think it's moderately deranged you don't think so you don't think the TVs require two hands for men to carry

(1:02:58) them um no I mean I guess it depends how big the TV is MHM like your living room

(1:03:03) TV it's going to you're going to take I mean my living room TV is big but like my bedroom T also by the way it's just

(1:03:08) less dangerous in general if you if you fire the first shot um chances are

(1:03:13) pretty good that that's the end of the confrontation I mean if you hit them yeah no you don't even have to hit them

(1:03:19) just fire the shot even oh gotcha yeah even that usually is enough to in the confrontation so okay anyway I guess

(1:03:25) we've stayed on Force Doctrine for a while yes did you want to cross-examine me on this um I I guess it I I am curious in

(1:03:35) terms of if you see so you don't make this as a moral claim it's just kind of

() 

(1:03:40) a fact descriptive descriptive claim so do you think men should do these things

(1:03:45) like which things um that they should use Force as an authority against

(1:03:52) women well sometimes in some cases sure like if a woman's committing a crime

(1:03:57) something like that I think men are totally justified in using Force I think if a woman attacks a man he's totally justified in using Force I'm talking as

(1:04:05) like a societal yeah but these are societal prescriptions if a if a woman attacks a

(1:04:10) man yeah he's perfectly it's perfectly acceptable for him to sure but there are instances where you say he you know like

(1:04:16) if um like would you condone wife beating well no but I wouldn't condone

(1:04:21) husband beating so sure but you're saying that you know men's Authority is through

(1:04:27) Force this is how why we should have patriarchy enforcement not so that's the requisite

(1:04:34) enforcement is yeah it is force yes yeah but that doesn't mean author is through remember my claim is that might makes

(1:04:41) not that it makes right okay but that it so so it's not a moral a no it's not it's just a descriptive truth so do you

(1:04:47) think that men should work to cooperate with women in

(1:04:53) society um no I think women should cooperate with men in society because

(1:04:58) they depend on mean yeah I'll explain I think that women depend on men for the

(1:05:04) use of forc Doctrine for their own protection so I think I mean I think under patriarchy sure no I think under

(1:05:10) matriarchy they still depend on men for Force um well you said protection right yeah

(1:05:17) Force yeah what are you protecting them from uh well you could be protecting

(1:05:22) them from other men generally right so um I think under patriarchy male per uh

(1:05:29) male violence is pervasive under matriarchy male violence is still pervasive why why is having a female

(1:05:36) leader going to make male Prov male violence no longer pervasive that's

(1:05:42) bizarre um like there's a difference between saying I have a society that's just filled 100% with women that would

(1:05:49) be a claim but you're not saying that you're sorry about a matriarchy versus a patriarchy right but I think when it

(1:05:54) comes to patriarchy OB obviously we're talking about male Supremacy and domination and a form of domination is

(1:05:59) through violence yeah yeah I agree with all of that so what yeah so I obviously

(1:06:05) if that's not a tenant of matriarchy then I don't think male violence would be pervasive because it's not used as a form of authority why are there still

(1:06:10) going to be men there yeah what's going to make them less violent well obviously because it's not

(1:06:16) used as a form of authority it's I did but I just got tied to whereever men are

(1:06:23) and women are women will depend on men for the use of force period that's my

(1:06:28) claim regardless of where they are so it doesn't matter if you have a queen like

(1:06:33) and it doesn't even matter if you put women think as the CEOs of everything are we assuming that like just Authority

(1:06:40) in general is force uh no Authority in general isn't Force but in order to have rights or

(1:06:48) laws or governance of any kind requires Force I mean I don't disagree with that yeah so that's going to require men so

(1:06:55) women are dependent upon men for Force period so I think that under a system of law sure under a syst under any system

(1:07:01) of governance there's no system of governance in which women are not dependent on men for Force none you

(1:07:07) don't think that can be replaced with technology nope how men can destroy the technology that's what force Doctrine is

(1:07:14) men may be in groups too but couldn't I say that about women no because you're still going to have to compete with a

(1:07:20) male group so your only options here are either of this like let's say let's even say you reduce the the male population

(1:07:26) down to 5% you're just like Yay it's all women now and it's 5% men or something

(1:07:31) like this you still would have a hard time controlling them we know this because there have been War torn Nations

(1:07:37) where like 80% of the men have died and they're still in charge because the that Monopoly on

(1:07:42) Force it's not because women don't have access to guns they have access to guns but they're less good with them guns

(1:07:47) require physical strength technology requires physical strength like tanks it requires physical strength to load one

(1:07:53) okay I mean our but when we're talking about cooperation like Co means with so I don't what's the delineation between

(1:08:00) you saying women should cooperate with men rather than men should cooperate with women because men have the option

(1:08:06) that women don't have of utilizing Force to make you cooperate the option well then that's not cooperating yeah well it is well hang on

(1:08:15) hang on but it is it is still cooperation so the idea here is just this is it the case that men should

(1:08:22) cooperate with women I guess if they choose to well that's what cooperation is I would just say if they choose

(1:08:29) to I wouldn't say that they should I mean they make the they're going to be the ones who make the rules because they

(1:08:34) have the force but that's not

(1:08:39) cooperation well it can be cooperation no Co means with so so it is it's doing

(1:08:45) it together are you saying that if somebody's in a position of authority necessarily that's not a cooperation

(1:08:51) like do you not cooperate with your children um I mean I I do cooperate with

(1:08:57) my children but that's arenth not an authority you're not an authority an authority in what sense that you're in

(1:09:04) charge in charge of certain things sure you're in charge of everything what do you mean I'm in charge of everything I

(1:09:10) don't I don't tell them like what can little Johnny tell you he's not going to the doctor today Mom can he tell you he's not going to

(1:09:16) school he's sick can he tell you he's not going to school again if he's sick that's a possibility okay but or you

(1:09:22) know I don't want to go to school's lying he's like I'm sick you think he's lying is Johnny going to school most

(1:09:28) likely yeah so but that's not Cooperative that's me using go and gets in the car and he's quiet when you take

(1:09:35) him to school and you drop him off that is cooperation I I see what you mean in

(1:09:42) that sense maybe there's a word a better word than I'm trying to think of where it's more working together and negotiating where there is no necessary

(1:09:49) Authority like a partnership yeah but why should men have a partnership when they have the Monopoly on Force

(1:09:56) I don't see why they need to have a partnership with women why why would you want to subjugate women it's not subjugation

() 

(1:10:03) anymore than it is with your children so I think it's a privileged position that they get because they have the use of force if they can be drafted and women

(1:10:10) can't they get extra rights what you don't get well again I I don't think that um like war in and the draft can

(1:10:19) always be like a necessary condition of the human existence okay give me a single Hundred Year span in which there

(1:10:25) wasn't massive war um lived in lived in peace for 600 years no the iray fought

(1:10:32) plenty especially within the iroy I mean um there is a period of time but there

(1:10:37) was also a period of treaty and peace the iroy can well you talking about Theo Confederacy no the the indigenous tribe

(1:10:44) the erise yeah I know they had a Confederacy though okay yeah so the Confederacy meaning not like in United

(1:10:50) States but under like a loose loose doctrine of law the iray Confederates my understanding is that the iray fought

(1:10:56) endlessly along with most Native American tribes uh no there was a period of I I would have to look up the source

(1:11:02) a period of of 600 years of Peace no I don't think war is an continuous state of uh mankind war is just fighting over

(1:11:11) uh resources yeah yeah sure yeah and Mankind's always fighting over resources

(1:11:17) well yeah because um of either scarcity or manufactured scarcity well I mean SC

(1:11:23) scarcity can simply happen um naturally right sure I mean I mean

(1:11:30) yeah are we talking about like so if you have yeah so if you just have Naturals natural scarcity which happens all the

(1:11:35) time you're going to have conflict and the enforcers in that conflict are going to be men men are going to be the Defenders of your country right but when

(1:11:41) it comes to like natural scarcity um then obviously if you're in like communal groups then that scarcity can

(1:11:48) be overcome where there's abundance not always depends on what it is like how are you going to communally in a group

(1:11:54) do do anything about a food shortage there's no F other communities yeah if you have access to them right and I I

(1:12:02) would say like in today's society we absolutely do yeah that's true in today's society we do have global trade

(1:12:08) things like this you can assist people with various things and War hasn't gone away at all not even a little bit well

(1:12:14) in the 20th 21st Cur man yeah because of manufactured scarcity I agree no it's

(1:12:19) not always because of manufactured scarcity uh yeah it would be dependence Theory Okay so why did we fight go to

(1:12:26) war with Germany that was over scarcity the second time World War II yeah um I mean

(1:12:33) obviously the rise of fascism so what was the scarcity um well within that one I would

(1:12:39) say Obviously it was uh like authoritarian regimes trying to scarcity

(1:12:45) land from who from Germany and Germany was trying to uh how did that affect us

(1:12:52) I mean it didn't but obviously we wanted to stop Imperial only so it didn't have anything to do with scarcity for us I

(1:12:58) mean eventually down the line it was America's concern that Germany or Russia would become a superpower and then start

(1:13:05) to to come take our land that's what wait what so there was no scarcity for

(1:13:11) us and we still got involved in the war it's not always about scarcity of resources I mean I I do think it is

(1:13:17) somewhat of a basis because isn't that isn't that what regimes are about are about power or

() 

(1:13:23) authority over your land and your people yeah people and and acquiring resources

(1:13:28) yeah what did that have to do with us we didn't have to get involved in that War I know you're you're absolutely right we didn't yeah so but we didn't get

(1:13:35) involved in it wasn't even packaged as like resource problems nothing so what

(1:13:41) resources were we without I'm saying that's like the Crux of

(1:13:46) War it wasn't the Crux of that war I mean w we were intervening in order to

(1:13:52) stop uh the Imperial from Germany to how

(1:13:57) does that well here's the thing even if we had Let It Go wouldn't we have benefited from that I mean it's hard to

(1:14:03) say yeah but I'm just saying like that had nothing to do with scarcity I don't think that the propensity for human war and violence is always about scarcity

(1:14:10) and resource I think that that's Marxist nonsense what would it be about oh it could be about all sorts of different

(1:14:15) things it could be about um an idea of Conquest right what do you mean by

(1:14:21) Conquest I want to take over everything cuz I want to well isn't isn't land a resource yeah but that doesn't mean that

(1:14:26) it's what's the scarcity you have plenty of land you just want more anyway yes

(1:14:31) but how's that come down to scarcity cuz you're saying the motivation I don't have enough it's

(1:14:37) essentially acquisition of resources and if you have more resources then you're less likely to have

(1:14:44) scarcity okay so you agree with me that kings are the ones who send their people

(1:14:50) to war yeah do kings have a lack of resources

(1:14:57) um I mean not with within like their own personal experience but within their Kingdom yeah isn't that what led to um

(1:15:04) the fall of Rome was essentially too much Global expansion and then uh because they didn't have the resources

(1:15:10) in order to sustain their civilization no well I mean maybe there's a small part there but it was

(1:15:16) Christianity basically is what destroyed Rome so that's what that's what

(1:15:21) basically took out Rome you know when it's all said done was Christianity the idea of no more unification of religious

(1:15:29) paganism but uh I guess that's neither here nor there you could that's another thing you could be fighting over just

(1:15:34) religion what's the scarcity there

(1:15:40) um oh sure I don't like you know Christians says I don't like Muslims Muslims say I don't like Christians sure

(1:15:46) it's sure where's the scarcity um I mean obviously that's not a scarcity of resources so sure I can

(1:15:52) concede that there could be other motivations yeah so and any I would say that would be the main V motivation though okay and so

(1:15:59) then within any motivation men are going to be the operators of force Doctrine they're going to be the ones fighting

(1:16:04) the war right okay yeah so if there're if that's the case they're going to necessarily need authority to do

(1:16:12) that it's a necessary Condition it's a necessary condition with the authority

(1:16:18) mhm this my argument for why patriarchy is a necessary condition I mean we we

(1:16:24) can we can agree that you know the men that are fighting are not the men making decisions

(1:16:30) right no they very much are often making decisions yes really you think that like presidents like Eisenhower are going

(1:16:38) going to war yeah Grant went to war Eisenhower went to war I mean the list of presidents that went to war is insane

(1:16:43) and the pipeline between General and president is also insane so yeah

(1:16:49) definitely lot of presidents sure I I would sure there are examples but ultimately I think there

(1:16:55) are obviously like a class of people making decisions and then enacting that through a proy of military what gives

(1:17:00) the president the most amount of power though is he's commander in- chief of the United States armed forces that's what gives him his primary proxy of

(1:17:06) power that's what gives all men their primary proxy of power is the authority over Force so the thing is sure I don't

(1:17:14) disagree with that the difference is is men can always change the conditionals for leadership and women can't so

(1:17:20) necessar I think under patriarchy absolutely sure how could they do it under matriarchy now I mean what what's

(1:17:26) the ultimate goal here for for Society

(1:17:31) for to be made I mean are you asking from my view or are you asking from your view from your view oh well from my view

(1:17:39) it's simple just the the spreading and propensity for Christian ethics in society why because I think people live

(1:17:45) better lives that way what do you mean by Better Lives oh I would say things I we'd probably have some agreement here

(1:17:50) right healthy children Healthy Families well adjusted uh lack of General degeneracy in societies things like that

(1:17:58) sure and so can can you give me a little bit more specifics I mean that was pretty specific like what uh would you say like

(1:18:05) access to Medical Care yeah I think you need General access to Medical Care yeah access to housing yeah in order to be

(1:18:12) healthy yeah yeah access to education sure um so I mean then we agree that

(1:18:21) the desired outcome of society would be human flourishing

(1:18:26) yeah but we have a very very different idea of what human flourishing is okay

(1:18:31) well what what is that for you so when you just talk about base things yeah I can agree with you that uh human beings

(1:18:38) generally speaking need to be educated to have housing things like this right but these are basic needs sure right

(1:18:44) when you but what about when you're talking about a hierarchy of needs what happens when we get past the basic needs

(1:18:50) what happens to civilization then what do you mean well okay so let's say we all have houses most of us do we have

(1:18:56) someplace to live almost nobody in the United States is starving almost nobody well that I mean uh starving and food

(1:19:03) scarcity I think are two different things I one in seven families rely on food banks are they Starving in terms of

() 

(1:19:10) starving to death in terms of starving at all um I I guess I just don't know how I

(1:19:17) would like relate starving yeah so they're relying on a food bank the difference between that being relying on

(1:19:23) the state for food the food is the basically the alleviation of the ability

(1:19:28) for you to eat right or not eat yeah so obviously if we're going to talk about then like access to food um like it

(1:19:35) would be nutritious calorie dense food well I mean uh yes but also not

(1:19:42) prepackaged process [ __ ] right yeah um maybe calorie dense wasn't the right word I me nutritious stse uh yeah

(1:19:48) whatever the nutritional standard is we would agree sure

(1:19:54) food scarcity like kids go to go to school hungry no every every kid who

(1:20:00) would possibly be hungry at school has access to school lunch program um I mean depending on uh where

(1:20:06) you live I know where I live school lunch is free but but not States there's no there's no place I'm aware of where

(1:20:12) if you are under the poverty line school lunch isn't serve to you for free but if you are above the poverty line then you

(1:20:19) don't have access to school lunch uh yeah probably not do you agree with that then yeah I think that that's

(1:20:25) fine okay yeah I don't think that uh so that would just be a misallocation of

(1:20:31) Parental resources so you're just misallocating resources they're your resources you can

(1:20:37) allocate them correctly or incorrectly I don't see why the state need allocate them for you well if we're going to talk

(1:20:44) about then kind of like the Dynamics of capitalism I do think we need to acknowledge that obviously capitalism

(1:20:49) needs to create a poor class in order to exploit their labor so I mean if if you're poor and

(1:20:55) you only have X amount of dollars so does communism what do you mean well so do do you agree with me when it comes to

(1:21:00) class that there's a such thing as social class um I guess it would mean what I

(1:21:06) guess I would need to know what you define as social class academics versus laborers sure like Prestige sure yeah so

(1:21:12) I mean is it going to be still in the Communist Society laborers to do most of the work yes but they would have access to

(1:21:20) the they they would own the meanss of production to where essentially they would have access to the materials in

(1:21:25) order to execute the labor whereas the capitalist has access to that so they're able to steal the Surplus value yeah but

(1:21:31) then you would have academics still who would have prestigious positions of being able to determine where the things

(1:21:38) which they now the means of production need to go and so those people necessarily end up with authority

(1:21:43) there's no way around it I mean I don't think uh like Authority in class are let

(1:21:49) us pretend for a second that intertwined let's find out let's let me this real

() 

(1:21:55) quick before I let you move on I I just wanted to go back to the original Point yeah we will but just real quick this whole table's communism let's say okay

(1:22:02) and uh within the confines of this whole table every little individual industry

(1:22:08) the workers own the means of production okay okay they're all producing it all who gets this decide where

(1:22:14) goes um well that would be the proletariat the proletariat decides where it goes yeah how uh through

(1:22:21) democracy through voting okay so government um well again it would depend on what

(1:22:28) you mean by government it would just be people in a governing body who make decisions on behalf of this democratically they democratically

(1:22:34) elected sure I just want to make the the delineation that it wouldn't be considered a state okay but it's a government sure

(1:22:40) yeah and so necessarily the people in the government who are making the decision on where these resources go MH

(1:22:46) those people are necessarily going to have to be imbued with authority okay yeah so if that is the case you're always going to end up with a class

(1:22:52) Society because the people who have authority are always going to have Prestige um well but it's it's the

(1:22:59) working people that have the authority no they they don't what the proletariat they don't get to determine where their

(1:23:06) resources get allocated somebody has to determine that whoever determines where the allocation of the resources go

(1:23:12) they're the ones be the community the community would have the authority so what if the community votes then to keep

(1:23:18) all of the resources for themselves and not share them with anybody okay they don't have to share them um correct I

(1:23:27) mean obviously then that sounds an awful lot like capitalism how would that be capitalism

(1:23:32) well I mean what's the difference right now between a company who has a a bunch of employees and they all make a whole

(1:23:38) bunch of products and they sell all those products and they keep all the money for themselves wasn't difference

(1:23:44) between that and a group of people who own the means of production the company they own the company and they sell a

(1:23:50) bunch of product work keeping their own product not not the capitalist workers are what do you mean workers

(1:23:56) keep their product now money no they don't they keep a paycheck right no the the product is um so if I'm a worker and

(1:24:04) my labor makes uh $1,000 worth of profit yeah uh the capitalist pays me my hourly

(1:24:10) wage which could be let's just say for the day a 100 bucks and then he keeps the 900 but in um you know that that's

(1:24:16) like an example within capitalist but within Communists like the workers own the means of production which means there's no capitalist who owns the

(1:24:23) factory who owns the materials how do these people who work in these factories allocate the resources amongst each

(1:24:29) other amongst each other well you can have uh democratically elected leaders

(1:24:35) or you can uh have votes so these democratically elected leaders could

(1:24:40) democratically say these people over here do more work than me they get more money well I mean under communism

(1:24:45) ideally would be uh moneyless but I think it would just be determined like if you work for a th if you work and

(1:24:52) produce $1,000 you get $1,000 so if your production makes $1,000 you

(1:24:58) get $1,000 can you spend that $1,000 on getting a bigger house than somebody else well again if we're talking about

(1:25:04) like true Communists it's it's moneyless so this kind of example um isn't really

(1:25:10) relative yeah but I'm just I'm feeling to see a single example you're giving me where I can't be like well it sounds

(1:25:17) like we could have class off of this immediately well I think class and Prestige or kinship are different

(1:25:23) concepts yeah I'm not disagreeing but I'm talking right now about class so it just sounds

(1:25:29) to me like if you have more resources you would be set in a class of other people who don't have as much res resources that that would be class right

(1:25:36) well no because you would have access to the means of Productions of resources that well you'd have access to

(1:25:43) the means of production at least where you work for resources right I mean you could go to like but you still need

(1:25:49) fruit and you still need bananas right you still need steak you need all of these things you need

(1:25:55) so somebody going to have to decide where all that [ __ ] goes right so that everybody get so then it would be yeah

(1:26:01) the community or and I think you can do that through reason through practicality well you can't have like you couldn't

(1:26:06) have 300 million people voting on where each individual piece of it would be like individual uh sex of community so

(1:26:13) obviously like let's just say for example like Brazil is exporting coffee and they have a really bad coffee season

(1:26:19) yeah then you know maybe exports don't go to countries that are farther

(1:26:24) just ones that are closer because there's only so much amount that someone can get and then so yeah maybe someone that

(1:26:32) makes no sense what do you mean well you're still going to have central people in a central Authority who would

(1:26:37) have to determine where cuz when you think about resources like just look around this room there cameras and

(1:26:44) monitors and plates and cups and I mean it's enormous amount of resources just looking around that all need to be

(1:26:51) allocated all over the place in equity I mean depending it doesn't necessarily need to be Equity

(1:26:56) based on someone's need based on necessity well everybody needs plates sure yeah so I mean you have to so I

(1:27:03) don't I don't necessarily say there would be one Factory in Texas that would produce all the plates within the country you can have multiple Industries

(1:27:10) based in certain communities but somebody's going to have to determine where all the plates in the country go

(1:27:15) how many how many does Houston get well the community can determine how how do you determine that How would how would

(1:27:22) the community so then going to vote on each individual shipment going to every node of the United States well again I

(1:27:30) don't know like why we're just saying that one place makes plates well you

(1:27:35) that was your example no I said there can be sex of oh I agree there could be that's even worse that just makes it the

(1:27:40) problem even more complex how well now we got there's already plates going to Houston they don't need them what do we

(1:27:45) do with our plates we we send them over here to this guy yeah wherever there's a need I I mean I don't know why we produce something that we don't

(1:27:51) somebody's going to make the determination of the need okay that's I don't necessarily think so there's going

(1:27:56) to be there's going to be what are called middlemen middlemen who are going to make a determination on where resources I think there are going to be

(1:28:02) people who do administrative duties sure those people are always going to have a higher Prestige than the laborers I don't think that's class that that's

(1:28:09) definitely class it's not class then why are making making decisions is not class

() 

(1:28:15) if you have authority authority is not class no no oh okay so then um who would

(1:28:22) you say that you have the same same amount of class hierarchy as the president um no

(1:28:30) why well that's not class though like me and the president those aren't class determinations those are Authority

(1:28:36) determinations they are class DET then why did you just say that you don't have the same class hierarchy as

(1:28:43) him I I'm sorry if I misspoke I just want to make sure that we're

(1:28:48) understanding the delineation between class so um yes I do think there is a

(1:28:54) ruling class and then there is a working class so in the hierarchy where is the president to

(1:29:03) you um it's a good question um I mean I

(1:29:08) would say the president is essentially a part of the state which is kind of uh an authoritative arm of the ruling class so

(1:29:17) he's higher in the hierarchy than you uh yeah he's an authoritative arm sure yeah so can you give me examples of people

(1:29:24) have authority who aren't higher in the hierarchy than you of people who have authority what do you mean a person who

(1:29:31) is in a position of authority over and at least as far as a government body goes who aren't in a higher hierarchy

(1:29:38) than you they're not higher than you are I mean I guess it would depend on what sex sect we're talking about

(1:29:45) any like any sect if they have authority necessarily they're going to be hired I

(1:29:51) what what I'm saying is when it comes Authority necessarily Central to the idea of class um like obviously the

(1:29:58) ruling class like do you do you think that people who own property have like

(1:30:04) what you would call Legal Authority yeah over people who who don't

(1:30:09) have property no no no so you would have legal Authority on your property sure I

(1:30:15) but right but I would say that having property or having Capital gives you a

(1:30:20) specific type of authority that's different than say a structural um presidential Authority it

(1:30:27) still gives you Authority my whole point is Authority so if I have vast vast amounts of property that people live on

(1:30:34) right you would definitely put me higher in a class hierarchy than the people who lived on my property

(1:30:40) likely so and that's because I have authority right but Authority is not just necessarily like decision making

(1:30:46) positions it can also be um access to certain resources

(1:30:52) or um or Capital yeah it's sure but my point is

(1:31:00) that Authority itself also seems to be a big position for hierarchy for being up

(1:31:07) in the hierarchy so what I'm saying I guess my ultimate argument just to reduce it very quickly because I feel like we're circling is just this that

(1:31:15) necessarily because men have the Monopoly on Force they will always be appealed to for Force Doctrine by women

(1:31:21) since that's the case you're going to have to have necessary author Authority imbued in them and because of that you're never going to actually have a

(1:31:27) classless society because whoever's imbued with the doctrine of force is

(1:31:32) going to be the one who's essentially in charge of people and that's just the way it is descriptively I mean do you think

(1:31:40) that men within this Society who hold High Authority are necessarily the

(1:31:45) strongest no no so like Authority isn't directly derived from from Force yes it

(1:31:51) is here's why because you can change the condition of who holds Authority with force and Men uniquely can do that and

(1:31:57) women can't so while it's true you could have let's say a woman who's in charge of a group of men like let's say you're

() 

(1:32:03) a second lieutenant in the United States military you're in charge of a group of guys right men can literally change the

(1:32:11) conditionals anytime they want to of their government and women cannot so men

(1:32:17) can always collectiv to change conditionals I'm sorry so we're talking about a lieutenant in the military

(1:32:24) and now we're talking about government conditionals well I was giving the example of where a woman could have some kind of authority over men right sure in

(1:32:32) terms of rankings sure yeah yeah sure but only that it's because men are not challenging that Authority that she's

(1:32:37) able to keep it men uniquely can do that and women cannot that's why so I I'm sorry are you

(1:32:44) saying that the Army can challenge her Authority no the president can remove

(1:32:50) her like in a second right okay yeah so I'm sorry what what's your point well

(1:32:55) I'm just saying that if men don't like the conditionals that they have they can overthrow the nation they're

(1:33:00) in well if men are in that position though correct men are always in that position to be in the position of

(1:33:06) overthrow are you talking like the president no I'm talking about just general okay maybe we're talking past

(1:33:11) each other let's back up inside of Any Nation institution okay in this case would you say a country

(1:33:18) okay um I don't know I guess it would depend on what you would consider country but I think you and I wouldn't

(1:33:26) disagree the United States is a country right sure okay if the men in the United

(1:33:31) States wanted to overthrow the right rightfully elected government of the United States they could women could

(1:33:37) not like citizens yeah and the only thing that would

(1:33:42) defend I I don't know about that the only thing that could defend the United States from that would be Menan so it

(1:33:47) would be men on the defense and Men on the offense but women have never historically overthrown any government

(1:33:52) with violence ever wants um again like do do you think that I I

(1:33:59) don't think men um citizens could could overthrow the United States government because of but that's because men would

(1:34:05) be there with guns to stop them well I I think that's uh because of again like tools yeah sure but what I'm saying is

(1:34:11) that only women had all the nukes that we wouldn't win no you wouldn't win why

(1:34:17) well who would you nuke yourself no the men in your hypothetical yeah where you going to Nuke the men at that you don't

(1:34:23) have to go right so men are everywhere so the thing is is that women are everywhere to I agree but men have the

(1:34:29) ability to enslave women and women don't have the ability to enslave men men have the ability to take themselves out of

(1:34:35) any governmental situation they want via force and women don't have that they never have had that they've never been

(1:34:41) able to do it once there's never been a violent government overthrow done by women ever not even once because there's

(1:34:48) men that's the problem right they'd have to face off with men only men can uniquely do that so are always in a

(1:34:54) position of patriarchy because you have to appeal to them for

(1:34:59) Authority I I don't think um that that is necessarily the case

(1:35:06) because then to when when you are going to enact uh violence against a group

(1:35:12) like you do have to expect that violence will be enacted against you agree and so I think there does need to be some kind

(1:35:18) of evaluation on why you're enacting the violence sure but

(1:35:25) that's the the problem is is like let's say we come to an agreement of why men

(1:35:30) are enacting violence right the Chinese are enacting violence against their women because of I don't know some

(1:35:35) cultural taboo from a thousand years ago I'm just wondering why men like what what is your philosophy around men

(1:35:41) enslaving women I I think I've already covered this I think they ought not enslave anybody but not just women they

(1:35:48) also ought not enslave men sure yeah it has nothing to do with the condition of women how however they're the only not

(1:35:55) have a duty to abuse that Authority well how is it abusive how are they abusing that Authority by simply

(1:36:02) well like and what when you're talking about abuse if men voted and women

(1:36:07) couldn't but men fought the wars and women didn't how's that abuse well I again I I think we're going

(1:36:15) back to like a system that is in current Place uh for like unnecessary reasons

(1:36:22) like essentially we're talking about how

(1:36:27) societies interact today under um noncooperative or uh non-cohesive

(1:36:35) goals okay what's the argument though for well

(1:36:41) for why it is that if men are are fighting the wars they're necessarily in

(1:36:48) a position of privilege where they can make the determination I mean I I don't

(1:36:53) like women can fight against uh alongside men I don't think this is they

(1:36:59) can't they literally cannot fight alongside men they they have like in the Civil War women were sneaking in to the

(1:37:06) military women were not fighting do you want would you like to get a death count on how many women died in combat in the Civil War versus men well they weren't

(1:37:12) allowed to enlist in the Civil so they they snuck in they're allowed right now and they fought on next to their

(1:37:18) husbands and you like a list of how many women right now are in combat Infantry capable of going to the front lines in

() 

(1:37:25) comparison to men do you want to know how many that is sure okay well let's start with this special forces how many

(1:37:31) female Navy Seals do you think there are um none how many none that's really

(1:37:38) weird are they I'm sorry are they barred from being Navy Seals um no oh that's and they are

(1:37:46) trying to become Navy Seals um I I think there have been women

(1:37:51) who a lot I mean how many Navy Seals are there I don't know but how I mean let's

(1:37:56) say I think that's a it's important delineation to make too cuz I'm sure you would argue a majority of men don't meet

(1:38:01) that requirement sure so how many men are meeting that requirement again it's but all the ones who are are men you

(1:38:08) know again but again it's saying the fence is 6 feet tall you have to be able to see over the fence and you know so

(1:38:14) you want them to lower the standard of physical strength for Navy Seals well again like if we're if we're talking

(1:38:21) about the certain systems that are in place I don't think like there there are countries that exist without Navy Seals

(1:38:27) there are countries that exist without what country exists without special forces there's no country that exists

(1:38:34) without special forces not one not to the degree that we have here I mean are you saying all countries have a Navy a

(1:38:40) military and an Air Force there's no country I'm aware of that doesn't have a military none well again I I delineated

(1:38:46) between Air Force that's just branches of military right yeah so what like no I

(1:38:51) think if you live in the middle of the desert you don't have a Navy but obviously yeah if you live in the desert you don't have a Navy but you still have

(1:38:56) a military that's the point sure but again like to what degree do you like how how large does this need to be

(1:39:03) I don't think it necessarily needs to be always a a necessary condition of a

(1:39:09) society yeah it does need to be a necessary condition of a society or because you have to have force in order

(1:39:15) to run a society you have to there's no there's no way around it but back to this you kind of off escate and almost

(1:39:21) got away with it but how many females Navy seals are there they're zero they're not barred from doing it so

(1:39:27) what's the barrier for them I mean obviously physical capacity they can't meet the physical capacity and so the

(1:39:33) thing is hang we can break this down going beyond that beyond the Navy Seals we just start with the Special Forces

(1:39:39) let's move over into other uh types of Special Forces how many female Green Berets oh I have no idea how many do you

(1:39:46) think um I don't know okay well Green Beret special force I don't think there's any of those either okay okay uh

(1:39:53) but if you get into combat infantry right women who are capable of being in

(1:39:59) combat in the Infantry MH would you say that that is on par with men or less than uh probably less than significantly

(1:40:06) less yeah yeah I don't think women are seared towards Armed Forces now let me ask you a question sure let's pretend

(1:40:12) for a second that you were a general you're and you should be able to think like a general right because women

(1:40:17) aren't incapable of that or anything so the enemy right the the enemy really

(1:40:23) likes to Grape women like that they really like that right and you have men and women who can

(1:40:30) fight in the front lines right so you draft men and you draft women do you think that the enemy would try to

(1:40:35) demoralize you by graping your women yes yeah would it work demoralize women no

(1:40:42) to demoralize men and women wouldn't it demoralize the men if the enemy was graping female soldiers and you could

(1:40:48) they could like hear them I think that would demize anyone sure yeah but it would if really demoralize the men right

(1:40:56) what I what what's because they can't do anything to stop it okay and they want

(1:41:01) to stop it right I would think anyone would want to stop gra yeah sure but uh when you're talking about your fighting

(1:41:08) force right do you think that the enemy is going to Grape the men I mean if there's no women sure they don't that's

(1:41:15) what happens in prison yeah sure it happens in prison not usually in infantry combat well I mean cuz there's

() 

(1:41:21) no like we're just giving example like when there's no women men Great Men yeah

(1:41:27) but that's first of all that does happen in prison it's not common but let me ask you this would it be more common in

(1:41:33) prisons would it be Comm more common in prison for there to be grape if they were co-ed

(1:41:38) [Music] um I mean grape happens a lot in prison being sex segregated yeah would it

(1:41:45) happen more if it wasn't sex segregated like if there was a lot of women around very violent inmates do you think that

(1:41:53) they would get graped there would be more grape or less grape um I think the women yeah they would grape women there

(1:41:59) would be a lot more grape right I mean there's opportunity they're smaller

(1:42:05) easier to do sure the same thing is going to happen in combat is necessarily like just an active physical strength

(1:42:12) yeah maybe not there needs to be motivation like I'm commanding you to Grape the enemy because it demoralizes

(1:42:18) them sure yeah so I mean don't you think that that takes away from the effectiveness of women in combat in

(1:42:24) general um I mean not not

(1:42:29) necessarily what so you're saying because women are present and there's an opportunity for

(1:42:36) the no in combat they're present right women women are present you agree that people get captured in combat all the

(1:42:42) time right so so let's just I I'm sorry let let me just understand this hypothetical here so there's

(1:42:47) hypothetical one where the entire infantry is men yeah and there's hypothetical 2 where mixed it's mixed MH

(1:42:55) and what what's there are different outcomes yes very different outcomes why

(1:43:03) are the the ones with men having a different because they're not getting

(1:43:10) graped by the enemy they're getting captured by the enemy but they're not get be demoralizing not as demoralizing

(1:43:16) as sending your own soldiers back pregnant with the enemy's enemy or enemy's baby inside of their womb that seems way more demoralizing to me okay

(1:43:24) wouldn't that doesn't that seem way more demoralizing to you um I mean definitely for one thing finding soldiers who would

(1:43:30) just like have gay sodomizing sex with men would not be easy to do but finding

(1:43:36) soldiers who would be willing to Grape the enemy's women doesn't seem like that would be very difficult to find okay

(1:43:42) would you agree with that sure yeah so yeah it's a it would be very demoralizing wouldn't it yeah yeah so

(1:43:49) it's probably not a good idea to have women on the Frontline combat because of that reason

(1:43:55) right [Music] um I mean I I guess that's just kind of assuming that that is like essentially

(1:44:02) what's always going to happen do you think that our enemies are not going to Grape our

(1:44:09) women um I guess I guess it would depend I mean if we're talking on front lines like hand toand combat

(1:44:15) um they haven't seen women they're fighting a war they haven't seen women in like 2 years what do you think

(1:44:22) they're going to when they capture civilians yeah what does that they

(1:44:29) haven't seen women in 2 years no that then you know they grape civilians as well sure yeah I agree yeah that's why

(1:44:37) usually when armies pull back they pull their civilian population back with them mhm so what because they don't want to

(1:44:43) get their female population graped by the enemy okay that's why they do that like

(1:44:48) okay so yes I do recognize that obviously there's going to be a different outcome in war for women than there is for for men gender yeah they're

(1:44:55) going to get graped and then they're going to get pregnant that's going to be really demoralizing right I I don't disagree

(1:45:02) but I I don't know if that's like a well I'll just ask you this you're in charge of your nation's security and the enemy

(1:45:08) is brutal and they're horrible and you need to win this war by any means necessary would you order your men to

(1:45:16) Grape the enemy women no even if you needed to win what if they were going to

(1:45:21) grave your women and you needed to demoralize them would you do it no see

(1:45:27) not even equipped to make these decisions not even equipped to make these decisions to justify grape

(1:45:34) no so just just to make sure that I got this right the enemy will justify that

(1:45:41) though right uh yes I don't know if they'll justify that but but they'll do it I mean depending and you just you

(1:45:47) just won't do it no so then it seems to me like having

(1:45:53) women in the military under your command probably wouldn't be a very good idea cuz they're going to get

(1:45:58) graped I I don't know how commanding my soldiers to Great their women would prevent the women in my milary from

(1:46:05) getting I'm just I'm just explaining to you I'm not telling you that you're making an immoral decision you're not

(1:46:12) right what I'm telling you is that under your view even if you're in command you still would acknowledge that the enemy

(1:46:17) is going to Grape your soldiers yes it it you know just like I would acknowledge that enemy could kill

(1:46:24) my soldiers they're going to kill your soldiers for sure yeah but they're also going to Grape your female soldiers mhm

(1:46:29) so do you think they have an advantage if there military is mostly men and yours as co-ed in infantry

(1:46:36) combat um again I think it would depend on other factors you know like access to resources strategy you have access to

(1:46:42) the same resources roughly that that's not that that's just an equalizer like that that's not actual real uh combat or

(1:46:50) like the real structure of it what do you mean I mean like I've said before what what

(1:46:56) good is brute Forest strength if you don't have water and food no I mean you have access to roughly the same amount of resources you and the

(1:47:03) enemy right you're just equalizing it that's my whole point yeah I'm talking

(1:47:09) about water and food real life what yeah it's real life that most of the time when professional militaries are

(1:47:15) fighting with each other they have water and food what do you mean it's not that can be a real hurdle for a lot of

(1:47:22) militar making sure that they still have access to water and food but it is the case that most of the time professional

(1:47:27) militaries have access to water and food most of the time would depend on the conditions yeah sure it depends on the

(1:47:33) conditions but you have significant advantages to having all soldiers that is an important tenant sure it's not

(1:47:40) just Brute Force strength it is strategy brute for strength it's access to resources and who do you think has the

(1:47:46) ability to have longevity in conditions which are extremely hot extremely cold

(1:47:53) that fluctuate all the time that require a sense of physical Readiness which sex

(1:47:59) you think yeah men yeah so wouldn't you be advantaged if you're if you didn't waste resources on training females for

(1:48:06) physical combat when you could instead train males for that um yeah in some sense so then again

(1:48:14) why the hell do you want women in combat in the military it's silly I mean if if

(1:48:21) they have the capacity to perform I mean obviously we're already looking at there is going to be kind of a filter for men

(1:48:28) in general but I mean you're right in terms of we're if we're looking for the elite within this specific one area then

(1:48:36) then that is going to be men yeah so then if you have access to men you're going to be spending x amount of money

(1:48:41) on soldiers why would you syn the same amount of money into a female for combat if you could sink that money into a man

(1:48:47) for combat well I mean we've already established that within this kind of level of of

(1:48:53) that it should be men it's going to be men just because yes it's going to be

(1:48:58) men and it should be men because they're going to be better at it right sure okay then what privilege do they

(1:49:05) get what privilege does who get do these men get because women aren't aren't able

(1:49:10) to do these jobs what privileges should these men get um in in terms of like rights these

(1:49:19) specific these specific men well just men in general all men why would all men because all men can be

(1:49:25) drafted and sent into combat well again this is like going from special infantry to draft is very different no it's not

(1:49:33) yes it is okay well then let's take a look at the Ukraine do I mean do the Ukraine right now men can be drafted up until age 65 they're not being drafted

(1:49:39) they are being drafted up till age 65 they're not they are the last draft that happened was in the 70s and the Ukraine

() 

(1:49:46) yes a man has not been drafted since the 70s oh we talking about the Ukraine government yes oh I'm sorry that's how

(1:49:52) we were talking about the United States yes I said then the Ukraine okay the Ukraine men can be drafted up to 65 well

(1:49:58) I I disagree with the draft okay got it that's great you disagree with it mhm but the only people right now who can be

(1:50:05) drafted are who men and the reasons that we just went over previously determines

(1:50:10) that the reason that we want to draft men is for this these exact reasons because they're stronger they're better

(1:50:15) in combat these are the positions we would need them in and because these are the positions we need them in women are

(1:50:20) excluded from those roles well again going from special infantry to just military bodies obviously more

(1:50:28) is just going to be better why it more takes way more resources more is not better yeah but numbers is

(1:50:35) also uh another strategy that wins War if you have more soldiers than the other

(1:50:40) team ye yeah sure that can be helpful but it's more helpful to have a very well-trained very combat ready military

(1:50:47) if you're drafting you're not they're not going to be well trained well we've won Wars with draes that plenty well

(1:50:53) trained so the thing is is like that's incor being trained and being well trained are two different things I guess

(1:50:59) you had Specialists too but the point is they were very much trained and they very much kicked the [ __ ] out of half the world so that was with draft e okay

(1:51:06) so the thing is is we've already established that men are far better in these roles than women men ought to be

(1:51:11) in these roles and not women this is by your own logic so what privileges should men get considering they can be drafted

(1:51:18) into these roles and women cannot be I mean if if we're going on a society

(1:51:23) based on like this is always going to be the outcome and this is a necessity um I I don't think necessarily

(1:51:31) there would I I'm I'm not against sending men to go to war against their

(1:51:38) will you are against it or not I I am against sending men to go to war against

(1:51:44) their will so Oh I thought you said not oh maybe I misspoke I'm sorry but you see just to just to clarify for the

(1:51:50) audience you you mean uh you you are against it okay I I would want them to

(1:51:56) um to elect to go and so what happens if nobody goes like they didn't want to in the Ukraine does Russia take the Ukraine

(1:52:03) over does Russia take over Ukraine um I mean I think it would again depend on uh

(1:52:09) other resources available if there are other militaries if there are other there's no so other

(1:52:14) militaries aren't going to step in then then yeah that would happen but I mean again forcing forcing men to go I mean

(1:52:20) you can't force them to fight they yes you can forcen to fight how the same way they did under communism they say you

(1:52:26) run at that Machine Gun Nest and if you turn around we will kill you and that's exactly what they

(1:52:32) did well I mean then what they did was they lined up they lined up thousands of

(1:52:39) so Soviet soldiers they handed him a rifle they said if you die the guy behind you pick up the rifle reload and

(1:52:45) continue to go and if they turned around and came back if they ran away men with machine guns were waiting for them and

(1:52:51) mowed them all down okay okay so yeah you definitely force them to fight we we I mean that's been done time and time

(1:52:56) again if you ran away in World War II you were a traitor and you were shot that's forcing you to fight run

(1:53:03) away from combat you get shot right I I'm saying obviously if if they don't fight they die like that's clear but um

(1:53:11) like if if they think they're going to die already I'm confused what do you know

(1:53:19) going to war they're like I'm pretty much going to die already so I'm just going to try and Escape so I can avoid that and if they kill me oh then the

(1:53:24) outcome is the same well that's not what happens I guess I guess my my issue you're compelled and pressed into

(1:53:30) service like you can't do anything if you're if you sign up if you don't sign up for the draft as a man in the United

(1:53:36) States you're not supposed to be able to vote I know so then how come if women don't sign up for the draft they get to

() 

(1:53:41) vote that's [ __ ] well again I'm I'm against the draft yeah I I got it so

(1:53:47) then just nobody defends the nation well I think obviously within America we have a huge uh

(1:53:53) Society that's very big on militarism which is why no one has been drafted nobody's been drafted because we haven't

(1:53:58) fought a professional War where we had hundreds of thousands of body bags being sent home that's why nobody's been drafted well sure but also there um I

(1:54:06) would say people are joining more than they were back then no I think that the rates per population remember at the

(1:54:12) time I think there was only 150 million people there was like half the people at the time than there is now mhm so no I

(1:54:19) think proportionately plenty of people were joining the military I I know if it's at the same rates because you had different benefits for it but plenty of

(1:54:26) people were joining the military okay the thing is though is that we just haven't had a war where hundreds of

(1:54:31) thousands of people die you have to replace your your soldiers right sure do you think people are going to be more or less likely to join if people are dying

(1:54:39) in Mass Al they'll be less likely to die yeah they'd be less likely so then what do you do you compel

(1:54:46) service like what else what else can you do other than compel service um I mean not go to

(1:54:54) war yeah but like you can't why do you think you can decide those things like

(1:54:59) you can't make the dec because like I think there is motivation obviously between countries who are engaging in

(1:55:05) war and the reasons behind those yeah but you can't solve those

(1:55:10) reasons like I I'm not um I'm not disagreeing with you that under like the idea of patriarchy that there is going

(1:55:16) to be some dependence on men because obviously I would think that still under the idea of matriarchy too no I I don't

(1:55:22) think that male violence would would be pervasive I mean when do you think patriarchy one second when do you think

(1:55:29) patriarchy originated I I I think it's always been the case yeah I would say

(1:55:35) patriarchy originated depending again on what um aspect you know what country we're looking at or what region uh would

(1:55:42) be between like 8,000 BC and 5,000 BC when do you think um what do you think

(1:55:48) our oldest written record is um um I believe it's uh Egyptian

() 

(1:55:54) scribes which I think is um yeah isn't that when uh the

(1:56:02) Sumerian yes and isn't that when they worship female Gods no I knew was a male God no was a female God no Anu was a

(1:56:09) male god promise no she was she was the good mother

(1:56:15) that's not a shoe a she Anu I'm pretty confident Anu was a a male God I N A N

(1:56:23) na yeah like anunaki that comes from the god the male god Anu like the the exaltation of Anu no it's just Anu I

(1:56:30) think Anu yeah the exal means god it just means god well the exaltation of an Anu is is thought to be the first poem

(1:56:36) and that's a female god L what do you mean l l is another God and in fact I

(1:56:42) mean if you're talking in fact I actually have a list here of Egyption Gods I'm sorry pre- 3500 year Gods let

(1:56:49) me give you the list real quick sure just because I brought it with me Wang on real quick Brian before you get into

(1:56:54) the Super chats oh no while he's looking that up you brought up the term patriarchy just can uh can you just

(1:57:00) Define the term for yeah male Supremacy domination

(1:57:06) independency okay male Supremacy domination and what was the last one

(1:57:12) sorry dependence dep okay Anu Mesopotamia Samaria 5000 BC King of the

(1:57:17) Gods enal Mesopotamia suiran enki Mesopotamia

(1:57:22) uh p uh pre-dynastic Egyptian 6000 BC um pre chupati L I said L pre Canan

(1:57:32) pre1 3900 BC I mean the list goes on and on and on and on and on of male Gods all

(1:57:39) right I'm not saying there are male Gods but wasn't that all

(1:57:46) before um

(1:57:53) it's all before your time frame of 3,500 years ago yeah uh no I I said between

(1:58:00) patriarch was established between uh 8,000 BC and 5,000 BC so that would be post patriarchy okay and now look up

(1:58:06) when the Epic of Gilgamesh happened okay because what I'm trying to determine is

(1:58:12) where you're getting your evidence that patriarchy happened 8,000 years ago when

(1:58:17) do you think our oldest written manuscript comes from well um I I don't

(1:58:23) think like obviously there's going to be a difference between how we establish culture in prehistoric times versus

(1:58:28) historic times and obviously historic would be defined as written yeah so when we're talking about things which are

(1:58:34) written what written accounts are there of nonpatriarchal

(1:58:39) societies what the Amazon are myth the here one second um I think it's uh

(1:58:47) Egyptian the God I know how to spell it

(1:59:04) uh you can do your thing now if I can look this up and if you if you need us to look anything up on our end we'd be

(1:59:10) happy to are you looking for like a list of languages by the first um I'm looking for something really specific and I

(1:59:16) can't remember how it's spelled cuz we have Egyptian Sumerian Acadian she's

(1:59:22) looking for Egyptian matriarchies oh okay mhm is that what

(1:59:28) you're looking for because we can um there's a specific uh written scripture that talked about um like if you are

(1:59:35) married to your wife like Adorn her uh to her an Egyptian text or

(1:59:43) okay yeah but that that could that could be based around Mutual submission as well which still wouldn't be matriarchy

(1:59:52) um I I mean if you want me to read the whole thing I can are called are you referencing the Nar narur pallet I no

(2:00:00) apologies if I'm saying that wrong narur

(2:00:09) pallette um if you want to do your thing Brian just um guys if just a reminder here if you want uh we have $100 reads

(2:01:52) one second sure really quick while you're still working on that we have Ole with uh

(2:01:58) gifted 50 memberships hey Ogle uh thank you so much man really appreciate your

(2:02:04) uh your G 50 gifted whatever memberships thank you so much man thank you thank you sorry go ahead uh it's a book more

(2:02:11) than 5,000 years old and possibly the oldest book in the world um and and essentially talks about worshiping uh if

(2:02:17) you are wise stay home love your wife don't argue with her feed her Adorn her massage her okay that it doesn't say

(2:02:25) submit to her I mean I don't have the full uh section right here M um what is the evidence that this is a

(2:02:32) matriarchal society uh well obviously the written

(2:02:39) text um and then like I said before the exaltation of an um that's thought to be

() 

(2:02:45) one of the oldest poems which is uh reflecting the Samaran goddess do you agree that Christianity is patriarchal

(2:02:52) yes okay is it true in patri in uh Christianity that we Elevate and

(2:02:57) venerate the Virgin Mary um I don't know what you mean by venerate we venerate we say prayers we I

(2:03:05) mean sure yeah we we V we venerate the Virgin Mary right okay yeah so the thing is is that even if it is the case that

(2:03:11) there's female goddesses just like there were in other Pagan Traditions that

(2:03:17) doesn't mean that that's a matriarchal society well how would you define a matriarchal society then women are in char

(2:03:23) I of the father is is patriarchy well um so I I would say prior

(2:03:30) to um 8000 BC we lived in more egalitarian society um leaning more towards

(2:03:37) matriarchy because of paternity uncertainty um as well as essentially

(2:03:43) just the relationship within tribes in order to uh guarant how does paternity un certainty assist with your point that

(2:03:49) these are matriarchal societies um well I said a galarian who essentially were men and women built

(2:03:55) Society together I would say they would lead towards matriarchy because obviously at that time survival of uh

(2:04:02) tribes is most important and obviously having children that survive and the care caregiving and nurturing of

(2:04:09) children uh would have been fulfilled by the role of women yeah what what makes you think that women had a choice in

(2:04:15) that I'm not saying that they did yeah so then it's not matriarchal then um it

(2:04:21) it absolutely what what I I said a galarian essentially and women working

(2:04:29) together if women don't have a choice do you think that that's them working with men what do you mean having a choice

(2:04:35) like why if man goes Bonk on head and you get graped how is that a choice

(2:04:40) how's that equality and egalitarianism well um I I don't know why you're just

(2:04:47) assuming I I would say that like the the idea of rape or I'm sorry of grape became uh into existence like with

(2:04:54) agriculture what what do you so you think that men weren't graping before

(2:04:59) then no I don't oh what's your evidence for that I don't think they understood

(2:05:05) men's role when it came to how children how women became pregnant and how children were created what do that have

() 

(2:05:10) to do with them just being horny that well I I don't think men grape because they're

(2:05:16) horny why not what do you mean so wait a second let me get this right is an act of humiliation so primitive primitive

(2:05:24) man right um you agree with me that homo sapiens have been around for about 100,000 years I think it's 300,000 at

(2:05:31) least 100,000 yeah okay but we didn't come in so we actually operated the same way we are right now we have the same

(2:05:37) brains same physicality basically same everything differences in height differences in smaller things like that

(2:05:44) but we have the same capacity so do you saying within that 100,000 years this

(2:05:50) let's just say for this for sake of argument but you know what we'll do the 300,000 within this 300,000 years only

(2:05:56) 10,000 years ago men figured out the technology of grape uh yeah I I don't think like if

(2:06:04) you don't know that sex creates children mhm then you your whole theory is that

(2:06:10) men are graping so that children can come into existence that's not my theory that's your theory on I think that's not

(2:06:16) my hide it in the sources go to the streamyard click the eyeball no no no no

(2:06:22) no no no no no no no no stay in OBS look at the sources tab just hide

(2:06:29) streamyard just hide it I apologize we had a technical diff difficulty you guys

(2:06:34) continue though yeah I think that men grape because they're horny too I disag one guys oh oh you

(2:06:40) disagree hold on can you hide it here too

(2:06:48) sorry yeah so let's find Let's test that and see if you actually do disagree um does every single time you

(2:06:54) have sex with a woman require consent well I would say sex implicitly

(2:06:59) um by definition would be consensual if it's not then it's grape so then every

(2:07:05) instance of sex would require consent correct okay so if a husband wakes up in the morning and he has a boner and he

(2:07:10) leans over and starts banging his wife while she's asleep is he graping her yes he

(2:07:16) is why is he doing that cuz he's horny I think cuz he assumes he has consent yeah

(2:07:23) so he's horny so therefore if it is the case that he's still graping her even if

(2:07:28) he assumes he has consent and does not that he's graping her because he's horny right no I I don't think that he thinks

(2:07:35) he's graping her doesn't but that that has nothing to do with the fact of the matter you said that men do not the

(2:07:42) motivation behind grape is not that they're horny that's definitely his motivation behind that grape no cuz he

(2:07:48) doesn't think he's graping her why would it matter whether he thinks he's doing because that determines the motivation

(2:07:54) right you're saying that men have to think that they're doing the act in order for them to be motivated by to do

(2:08:00) the ACT no not at all I'm not saying that um men don't commit grape un like

(2:08:11) unknowingly Okay so this guy is graping his wife which by the way means that I've graped my wife I don't know how many times that's a weird thing to admit

(2:08:18) um no I'm I'm fine with it like if fine saying that you've graped your wife yeah if you think that me rolling over in the

(2:08:25) morning and she's asleep and waking her up with sex is grape I'm fine with she's unconscious she's asleep for sure that's

(2:08:32) unconscious right sure yeah if if she had too much to drink and passed out yeah we' done that

(2:08:39) too when we're both drunk yeah well I mean where she passed out yeah she's also great Me by this metric too she's

(2:08:45) woken me up with sex I didn't content I I just want to make sure I understand what you're saying here are are you

(2:08:50) saying that you've you've graped your wife while she's been passed out I'm saying while my wife has been sleeping

(2:08:55) I've woken her up with sex many times and vice versa so did we grape each

(2:09:01) other uh by definition yeah yeah so so we're both she grapes me sometimes I

(2:09:07) grape her sometimes little Force penetration is still grap a little grape here little grape there she grapes a

(2:09:13) little I grape a little weird we all do a little bit of graping why totally not

(2:09:18) weird by the way I I'm just going to tell you

(2:09:24) what's that would you continue if she didn't wake up uh I don't know half the

(2:09:30) time I'm drunk right so you you don't know if you would

(2:09:35) continue no I don't think I would continue if she didn't wake up why that it's less

(2:09:42) fun it's right so so obviously you want your partner to be conscious enthusiastic yeah but she

(2:09:48) wasn't conscious when we started I I understand that little grape there so

(2:09:54) then why not just wake her up why do I need I am waking her up with

(2:10:01) my penis waking her up my penis crazy why is that crazy do you know how common

(2:10:08) it is that men and women wake each other up like a man will be woke up by his girlfriend how common it is yeah so what

(2:10:14) does that have to do with anything what makes it crazy because they're unconscious so

(2:10:21) do you know what implied consent is um I do know what implied consent is

(2:10:27) there's an implied consent when you get married it's it's implied that you're consenting to sex I don't think it's

(2:10:34) necessarily then you have to bite the bullet that my wife has raped me any number of times I've told you I I already agree with you and you think

(2:10:40) that that's rational that it's rational to say what do you think that I'm emotionally scarred cuz my wife rapes me

(2:10:45) or grapes me no no but she's is she emotionally scarred by me graping her um I mean I don't know probably not so then

(2:10:52) rap's grape can just be a neutral act where it doesn't harm anybody I mean I definitely do think it it can harm in

(2:10:59) certain capacities if you're not consciously aware of it yeah but it's not harming anybody right so grape hang

(2:11:04) on Grape can be morally neutral I just want to make sure we're clear what would make it morally bad demonstrate the harm

(2:11:10) who's being harmed um well I think in some Capac it

(2:11:15) would be the same harm that would come uh of someone engaging with someone who

(2:11:22) uh is like dead I think the psychological I I think psychological

(2:11:27) aspect of wanting to demonstrate it demonstrate that there's har second one second I think the psychological aspect

(2:11:33) of wanting to engage an intercourse with someone who is unconscious is is highly harmful demonstrate it

(2:11:42) demonstrate what how how so if my wife you just got done saying if my wife wakes me up it's classified as what is

(2:11:48) like paraphilic help me out with this I'm totally asleep okay completely asleep and I wake up and

(2:11:54) my wife is giving me a [ __ ] I wake up to that okay what's the harm how have I

(2:12:00) been harmed show tell me how tell me how this possibly is harmful to me I'm not

(2:12:05) saying it could be harmful to you so then grape is morally neutral sometimes um no I don't think it's

(2:12:12) morally neutral like I I don't think like NE I don't think harm necessarily has to

(2:12:18) come to the victim in order for it to be then what would make this morally bad

(2:12:23) what makes it morally bad I told you the psychology of wanting to engage in intercourse with someone who is

(2:12:31) unconscious okay why is it you haven't explained how that's harmful or how that's bad one second would you engage

(2:12:37) with your wife if she were dead no of course not why because her soul has left

(2:12:43) her body she's not a person anymore her soul has left her body pleas She's Not a Human Being anymore she's be like

(2:12:50) [ __ ] dirt can you give me like the secular position why do I need to give you any

(2:12:56) other position how is it I I think it's you need to give me from your position instead of office skating what actually

(2:13:02) makes ital try to give it an analogy yeah well can you just tell me this what makes it immoral for my wife to wake me

(2:13:09) up with a [ __ ] what makes that immoral by the way have you ever woken your ex-husband do you ever wake him up

(2:13:16) like that no never never happened once not not that no no all

(2:13:24) right but you you realize this is very common right um sure yes and so just people are

(2:13:32) just commonly graping each other um yeah I mean I think there are a lot of instances where where grape happens

(2:13:38) where people don't think they are graping someone so that's that's a part of like miscommunication Theory okay

(2:13:44) great I just want to make sure I get the correct or the the answer to this question

(2:13:49) correct what is the actual harm and demonstrate it for me logically

(2:13:55) please or the immorality why is it immoral for my wife to do that to

(2:14:01) me um well I mean obviously if if we're talking about consent I think uh the

(2:14:08) basis for that is the fries model which is uh freely given reversible

(2:14:14) informed um enthusiastic and specific and so obviously it doesn't meet certain

(2:14:20) aspects of those criteria why is that immoral though I like it I like it when she does that what is immoral about her

(2:14:28) doing that I want her to do that I'm not conscious at the time that's true but

(2:14:34) I'm very [ __ ] enthusiastic that I want to wake up that way very enthusiastic about

(2:14:43) it I again I I think pleasuring someone who is unconscious is is psychologically

(2:14:50) concerning uh I'm sorry about your mind state of concern that's very carinish of you but

(2:14:56) can you tell me why it's imish it's very car your concerns very carinish but why is it immoral um I I would place it under like

(2:15:04) a paraphilic um sexual behavior so all of the uh men out there whose wives have

(2:15:10) woken them up with sex all of those women are ped are I'm sorry paraphilic

(2:15:17) paraphilic um I think the act itself they want to have sex with dead they want to have sex with dead people I mean

(2:15:23) paraphilic is just defi just defined as like atypical sexual preferences and yeah to like yeah but you were saying

(2:15:30) with someone who you were saying it was necrophilic well necrophilia falls under paraph so does like necro necrophilia so

(2:15:38) you think that there's tons and tons of women out there are NE obviously like like pedophiles and uh like necrophilia

(2:15:44) are two different things just means atypical sexual desires like I I would I

(2:15:49) would classify Kink under that do you agree with me that tons and tons and tons of women likely wake their man up with some sort of I did yeah yeah so

(2:15:56) like asked and answered so then is that they're they're kind of necrophiles that's not what I'm

(2:16:01) saying well I don't understand what you're saying it can't be by the way that doesn't make any sense it can't be

(2:16:07) uncommon if it's common um well it it's if we're talking

(2:16:13) about like the um experience of like atypical sexual behaviors then yes

(2:16:19) engaging with someone who is is unconscious Comm is an atypical it's not atypical if you're saying it's common

(2:16:27) that would be typical I mean in terms of like a common occurrent sure but in

(2:16:32) terms of like a common outcome of intercourse it's not yes it is you you

(2:16:38) I'm sorry I think it's very typical you you commonly start intercourse unconscious that's not what I said I

(2:16:44) said it's very typical to do it though so like I don't typically

(2:16:51) uh eat Gourmet caviar but you would agree with me that it is typical that

(2:16:57) people do eat Gourmet it's like a typical Behavior you wouldn't say it's atypical te or caviar would you again

(2:17:03) just because something is common doesn't mean it's typical what is typical mean so I I think like we could talk about

(2:17:11) frequency let's just make sure we get this right what does typical mean try to I just want to make sure I know what typical means sure one second I think we

(2:17:17) can talk about things happening in common frequency um but in terms of how often things

(2:17:24) happen outside of that frequency is going to make it like so 1% of 4 million

(2:17:30) is going to be a large number so we could say it's common but in terms of looking at it in a percentage it's only

(2:17:36) 1% so it's atypical okay so I don't understand how

() 

(2:17:42) when we're talking about behavior um ipal what do it okay then

(2:17:48) what threshold does it need to meet to become atypical or for Behavior like percentage wise I I don't know so then

(2:17:56) how do you know what's atypical I would just say the classification uh do do you

(2:18:02) think most people when they have sex are are doing so unconscious so like with an unconscious what I said no so so that

(2:18:09) that's my my threshold okay well then do you think that most people have sex missionary

(2:18:17) style or doggy style most of the time what V had to

(2:18:22) gas cuz would that make doggy style atypical um well no cuz again we're

(2:18:28) talking about percentages right so then I would need to know what is the percentage before it becomes

(2:18:34) atypical um I don't know I don't know yeah yeah so then you can't really make the claim it's atypical well then how

(2:18:41) can we make the claim that anything is atypical good good question I didn't make the claim it's atypical you don't think like par paraphilic

(2:18:49) sex desires exist yeah I think that we can definitely make claims to that yeah yeah sure okay sure but when I I guess

(2:18:56) the delineation here we're talking about is just typical versus not typical I think that it's if if you're talking

(2:19:02) about what is common yeah I think it's super common that this happens all the time in terms of volume or in terms of

(2:19:09) percentage um both yeah I think it's very common so

(2:19:16) you think this is like 50% of sexual interactions but I think that 50% of

(2:19:21) people have had this sexual interaction but I'm asking in terms of we if we were to classify all sexual

(2:19:28) interactions would would this be a common where people start off intercourse with one partner unconscious

(2:19:37) no no no it's not it's not going to be something it's not going to be but that doesn't make it not common you know what

(2:19:44) I mean like I feel like we're quibbling now like we're saying the same thing I hope we are but maybe we can

(2:19:50) semantically maybe we can semantically get here I mean why why would okay yeah we already we you already answered cuz

(2:19:58) I'm horny that's why I do it well um and I enjoy it I enjoy graping I enjoy it

(2:20:05) having sex with someone unconscious my wife yeah yeah I like waking her up that way but you said if she didn't wake up

(2:20:12) you would stop you know she does sometimes she's like I don't she's like ah and I'm like yeah that's right and

(2:20:19) she's like okay I know yeah she's like like she can't

(2:20:24) believe this is happening I've really shocked her and then she just kind of she's okay with

(2:20:30) it is that wild um am I graping her I I I think

(2:20:37) without having some form of like Express consent then yeah yeah damn I do this

(2:20:43) all the time like constantly yeah it happens all the time

(2:20:49) constantly it's crazy yeah like anytime I wake up with a boner if she's not awake she's

(2:20:55) definitely getting woke up that way why I I'm curious why don't you just wake her up I am waking her up with my penis

(2:21:02) I'm asking before I'm asking what what is the purpose of waking her up with your penis rather than just like jolting

(2:21:07) her because I think it's hilarious and it feels great you get the same outcome whether you wake her up if you wake her

(2:21:14) up it's like a big surprise for her you know surprise a surprise of is

(2:21:21) wanted I just assume it's wanted so you just assume consent from

(2:21:27) my wife yes absolutely and by the way I'm just going to tell you right I

(2:21:32) completely stand behind this this is not trolling 100% I I've never 100% stand

(2:21:40) behind this and I think it's not a big deal at all okay like not even a little bit and I actually haven't heard you

(2:21:47) demonstrate cuz you said it's not harmful to her and it's not harmful to you I actually haven't heard you

(2:21:53) demonstrate why this is even bad they just kind of just think so I mean sure I

(2:21:59) I definitely think it's really icky that someone wants to have sex with someone who's unconscious like um I think having

(2:22:06) would you have sex with her if she were in a coma no so so what what is the delineation here well I

(2:22:13) just would get the I I'm just no like no really like from your what if she has asthma she does have asthma oh okay yeah

(2:22:21) just checking does what does that have to do that could like stun her into like a you know like she can't breathe yeah I

(2:22:28) don't know Rachel has uh asthma right now yeah mhm yeah I never mind I'm sorry

(2:22:35) what is am I missing something with his asthma have to do but here's the thing I will say this

(2:22:41) okay I'm actually okay with my wife like having sex with me if I was in a coma I'd be fine with that that's crazy I I

(2:22:50) why what crazy about it why should she deprive herself because I'm in a

(2:22:55) coma um I think when we're talking about like sexual experience um consent is

(2:23:01) definitely the foundation in terms of you're not only considering your experience but you're also considering

(2:23:06) your partners no I'm just considering mine like I just want to have a good

(2:23:13) time so I wake her up with my penis yeah I think it's um very harmful to

(2:23:21) not consider your partner's experience when engaging uh in in Intercourse cuz it is

(2:23:26) it is a mutual experience why does you think she does that to me then do you think she just doesn't respect me very

(2:23:31) much that she would wake me up like that like I just wake up and she's literally writing me don't you think

(2:23:37) that's horrible what if she like you woke up with her like using your her

() 

(2:23:43) teeth what do you mean huh oh SC um I I really really don't want to

(2:23:50) talk about the sex life you have with your wife can we can we make it maybe less about this is just no this is super

(2:23:56) easy for us to get down to this I crazy ass idea you have of what that want

(2:24:03) consent so like here I'll give you an example um I'm drunk and a woman's drunk

(2:24:08) are we graping each other yes you think that that's not [ __ ] crazy no I mean do you think uh like

(2:24:17) children engaging would be great each other no oh yeah see I I think I just

(2:24:22) have a higher standard for consent when it comes to no no no wait you said children yeah yeah yeah that would be

(2:24:28) well that wouldn't be grape that would be something different because it is true that they can't consent right but

(2:24:35) they both kind of can't consent together so they don't I don't think they understand the ramifications of

(2:24:40) what they're doing I think if you're drunk you do I don't think that drunk being drunk I just put your logic into a

(2:24:46) different scenario so it's not the same logic how how is it because in one you don't understand the other one you do

(2:24:52) like one you don't have the capacity for again it depends how drunk you are you might not have the capacity Okay then if

(2:24:57) I get drunk and murder somebody not my fault um I

(2:25:04) mean uh people have gotten got off for murdering people in their sleep yeah so

(2:25:09) I didn't consent to murder right so therefore I like no no big deal I mean

(2:25:15) you didn't consent I I don't know what that has to do with anything in terms of like the vi the rights violation you

(2:25:20) grape when you're drunk are you responsible for that yes so I don't

(2:25:26) understand then I'm very now I'm actually really confused so you can be held responsible for the actions that

() 

(2:25:32) you take when you're drunk of course okay yeah like even if you're blacked out and you get in your car and you

(2:25:37) drive and you kill someone yeah okay so then why can't two people consent when they're

(2:25:43) drunk consent meaning to agree cuz obviously it doesn't meet the criteria of being informed Okay so I don't then

(2:25:51) why wouldn't it be attempted murder instead of murder if you killed someone kill them right I mean I guess if you

(2:25:56) tried and you failed it would be attempted murder okay so let me ask you this okay uh even though that makes no

(2:26:01) sense I'll just let it go just to try how does that make no sense I'll explain okay so let's say two people uh grape

(2:26:09) each other why aren't both of them put brought up on charges for grape well most people who grape aren't brought up

(2:26:14) on charges yeah I know but that's not my question my question is if two people

(2:26:19) get drunk and have sex they're graping each other shouldn't both of them be charged with a crime I mean in theory

(2:26:27) yes so do you think that we should mobilize law enforcement to enforce that um I mean I think again it's what

(2:26:34) do you mean to mobilize law enforcement well it's not okay for me to Grape somebody or them to Grape me right why

(2:26:40) would it make it okay for us to Grape each other at the same time I'm not saying it's okay okay great then it should fall under the crime of grape do

(2:26:47) you think if like I go out with my best friend and then I wake up in bed with them naked and you know we assume that

(2:26:54) we had sex that that that isn't harmful to sure if it's something that you you didn't want to do sure I think it's

(2:27:01) harmful to you okay yeah so then people who get drunk and have sex should go to

(2:27:07) jail um I mean I think if uh yeah you I

(2:27:14) in terms of going to jail uh I think it's going to be really hard to establish establish what want Grapist to

(2:27:21) go to jail right yes or no um well I I don't think that like prison is

(2:27:27) necessarily an effective way to to solve rights violations where do you want Grapist to

(2:27:33) go uh well I I I'm for a reformative justice so I'm against police and

(2:27:39) prisons are we talking about like what my ideal would be or within this current Society within this current Society

(2:27:45) where should they go um within that aspect of of two

(2:27:50) people got drunk and had sex with each other so are is there no that's not what

(2:27:56) I asked should where should Grapist go when they grape should they go to prison

(2:28:03) or not um I think they should go to some kind of uh mental health facility

(2:28:11) or um should have some kind of Duty to

(2:28:18) uh a essentially address the harm that they've committed within Society I'm

(2:28:24) more on focusing well are you going to isolate them in this mental health fa Behind Bars it depends it depends sure

(2:28:31) if they graped are you going to put them behind bars while they're getting help so that they're not part of society it

(2:28:37) depends yeah it depends on what on obviously the context of the crime it's

(2:28:43) grape that's the context you have grape somebody sure but are you saying that

(2:28:49) some some grapes are more morally bad than other grapes I'm saying that they have different uh

(2:28:55) treatments okay so if a man grapes a girl right M she can't consent she

(2:29:03) doesn't consent I mean you say girl you're talking child no a woman sorry

(2:29:08) okay yeah so he grapes a woman he should go to jail

(2:29:13) right um well I no I I I believe in restorative justice yeah okay where this

(2:29:20) guy goes you want to keep him there while he gets this done cuz he's not going to consent to go to it right again

(2:29:27) it would depend on on context okay um so he's had a party with

(2:29:34) a girl she's drunk and he's not he has sex with her did he grape

(2:29:40) her uh she's drunk he's not okay yes he graped her what should happen to that

(2:29:48) guy like what what would would my sentence be yeah um that uh essentially if we're

(2:29:55) talking about restorative justice that he is educated on the harm that he um

(2:30:00) committed um and that he receives mental professional help in terms of

(2:30:06) understanding his actions so does he go someplace for this to

(2:30:13) happen that he's not allowed to leave until it's all done I mean in that context um yeah be

(2:30:20) for a short duration of time sure and is that place going to have like bars and guards and things like that in order to

(2:30:26) keep him there um maybe not bars but maybe um you know like doors that lock

(2:30:31) sure and then he gets out and he goes and he does it again what happens then where should he

(2:30:36) go then um he would go back to the facility and then he does it again a long-term care facility yeah oh longterm

(2:30:43) now yeah okay and would that place have bars and guards so he couldn't leave um

(2:30:48) I'm again not not bars and guards but yeah doors that lock attendance so what

(2:30:53) happens if he escapes like he doesn't want to do it and he leaves and he leaves mhm then he

(2:31:00) would be brought back and so it's likely that most people

(2:31:06) would want to leave they don't want to be there right sure yeah so

(2:31:12) then wouldn't you do something to keep them in like bars and guards I mean I

(2:31:18) I'm answering the same you're asking the same question and I'm answering well because okay so it's like this they go

(2:31:23) to a mental health facility the reason I'm asking and but now it feels like I have to pry it out so I'll just spell it

(2:31:28) out right they escape they go they do the same crime you're going to take them back to the same facility they escape

(2:31:33) they do the same crime they going to take them back to the same facility the the difficulty with your example is that

(2:31:39) you're making a lot of presuppositions is that if um you know someone commits this act that um they

(2:31:48) have a high likelihood recidivism uh they do have a high rate

(2:31:55) of recidivism I I don't think so yeah because I don't they don't even think that they see it as a problem like I

(2:32:00) don't think that two people get drunk and have sex even see it as an issue well then why are they filing a police

(2:32:06) report they're not but here's the thing do they need to file a police report for me to file a police report somebody's

(2:32:12) been graved no I can file that report right how how would you file that report like if some chick got graped behind a

(2:32:18) dumpster and didn't want to come forward I can still call the police and file a report saying I witnessed a grave sure

(2:32:25) yeah so that I mean you can do the same thing with two drunk people right hey officer but was drunk

(2:32:31) and he was drunk you're kind of see and this is kind of the the issue that I have when we talk about um grape and

(2:32:37) like sexual violence is that uh there seems to be like this notion that the

(2:32:44) judicial system or legislation can solve for these things and solve for these outcomes and I just don't think that

(2:32:50) they can well I think it has to be more of a proactive measure I don't even

(2:32:56) rather than a reactive measure I don't even think they agree with you on this that this is grape I don't think that so

(2:33:02) for instance I don't think that two people who get drunk and have sex are graping each other I think that that defies what we mean by gra I mean I

(2:33:10) think there's a level of degree like you would say if someone is is blacked out drunk and someone else is sober yeah I

(2:33:17) think that when we're talking about grape we're talking about about forcing yourself on somebody who doesn't want it

(2:33:22) it's a violation there're ton like I could even give you examples Bill Burr famously had the bit where he was like

(2:33:28) no doesn't always mean no and the feminist says yes it does and he's like no it doesn't because you can have

(2:33:34) things like no no stop no no and it's and they're completely teasing and you

(2:33:40) laugh because it's true right it doesn't actually always because I think it's funny yeah but it doesn't always mean no

(2:33:47) no doesn't actually always mean no do do you think that that gives like young men

(2:33:52) the impression that when they hear no that it's like a negotiate a negotiation opportunity I think sometimes it is it's

(2:33:58) pretty obvious why like it's super obvious to me that like you want to talk someone into

(2:34:04) having sex with you yeah no no no but I think I'm sorry I just want to let you know like um I need a bathroom break

(2:34:09) soon yeah yeah I'll have a smoke too while you do that so sure uh but just to finish this point no I just wanted to so

(2:34:16) very very simple mhm I think that when um like uh I might be playing with my

(2:34:23) wife or messing around with my wife for instance and say something like this like um maybe she goes stop don't stop

(2:34:32) stop and then go and then she doesn't really want me to stop though right it's a big like there's body language in

(2:34:40) chemistry that comes with The Human Experience sure obviously you're in like a committed and established relationship

(2:34:48) sure so no does always mean no

(2:34:53) um I I think that sure context dependent I think it can obviously like if we're

(2:34:59) like obviously consent uh CNC yeah I think that's different well

(2:35:06) that's that's another context though right yeah it is but I I think that no doesn't always mean no and that it is

(2:35:13) context dependent and I think that the idea that two drunk people having sex are graping each other and it's just

(2:35:19) okay cuz one one gra cancels out the grape it seems like if both of them are graping each other it's a contradiction

(2:35:26) inter ter it's like a paradox the Paradox is um grape is from your view

(2:35:33) can't consent and yet if they're both aspect if they're both enthusiastically graping each other they seem to be

(2:35:40) enthusiastically consenting so like how do you how do two people mutually they not under the

(2:35:48) influence so what that obviously affects aspects of judgment you know just like um your

(2:35:56) capacity for for brain development yeah but you're both under the same effect right I I I never said you were

(2:36:04) like willingly like I don't know about you but you do agree that it's very common

(2:36:09) for people married unmarried everywhere between drunk all the time yeah and and they have sex when they're drunk in fact

(2:36:16) but I mean I'm sure you yourself would would have a line right yeah there would be there would be a line sure and where

(2:36:22) where is that line um you mean of when I wouldn't like if a chick was passed out or something

(2:36:28) crazy so if she were like falling down slurring her words couldn't hold like

(2:36:34) her phone m still fair game no I think that's a little much for me but but that

(2:36:40) might be a little more that might be a little much for me right I don't think that I could say that some guy graped

(2:36:47) her because she was really drunk and she said yes like I I don't know how does

(2:36:53) have the motor skills to to hold a phone but well now you're you're you're changing it to like semi I didn't that's

(2:36:58) exactly what I described that's semiconscious at that point right that's exactly what I described you know she's

(2:37:03) dropping her phone she's slurring so that's semiconscious at that point so semiconscious is not okay yeah she's

(2:37:09) basically half out of the bag yeah like she's gone and obious you're that faded

(2:37:15) if you're that faded sure right but if the guy is that drunk and and she's that drunk I mean again like what are we

(2:37:22) classifying as drunk I guess whatever you just said motor skills gone whatever you're both that that smashed and then

(2:37:29) you go home and you bang each other from your view you're graping each other that that seems way more absurd to me I I

(2:37:34) don't know why I don't know why you like can't think that you can because

(2:37:40) what it does it because it infers that there's grape that's morally neutral and

(2:37:45) I think that grape would always necessarily have to be bad for me to last fight is

(2:37:51) GRA I I don't think that just because two people like are uh are not of the

(2:37:57) capacity to give informed and enthusiastic consent that that makes it

(2:38:02) morally neutral well you have to tell me what makes it morally bad then because

(2:38:08) you still have not done that you just kind of keep on reverting to descriptors without giving me the actual this is

(2:38:15) actually bad this kind of grape because of H because of because of what because

(2:38:23) of what what actually makes it like if if both parties wake up in the morning

(2:38:28) mhm and they look over and go who are you and I don't know the other one's like I don't know either but we definitely had sex last night and

(2:38:35) neither of them care right like what's the problem here who's been who's

(2:38:41) actually been VI like well how could that be a morally bad thing that you wake up next to a stranger and you can't

(2:38:47) remember you had sex but yet you don't care care no no no that definitely had to be grape on both

(2:38:53) parties right had to be I I think the harm is again the fact that you would

(2:38:59) engage in intercourse with someone of of that capacity and both of you are in

(2:39:05) that capacity I know but again that that this is um like an experience that is

(2:39:11) desired is is the male more culpable in this situation no if they're both equally

(2:39:17) drunk is the male more culpable um I don't know why he would be

(2:39:23) yeah I don't either that wouldn't even logically follow but this but this doesn't still you just gave me a descriptor you still didn't tell me

(2:39:29) actually why it's bad like why is it actually bad I I did I think um

(2:39:35) essentially like your your psychological understanding of how you engage in sex

(2:39:40) um can be bad and harmful like sure maybe in this one instance you didn't hurt someone but in another instance

(2:39:47) that could very well be the case that could be for anything literally anything

(2:39:52) like what like just you pick up a chick and you have sex and your dick is too big this case didn't hurt anybody the

(2:39:59) next case it can hurt anybody that doesn't have to do with consent though yeah but the point is is like you can

(2:40:04) put that standard to almost anything you can put the standard of like uh well in this case it didn't do anything but next

(2:40:11) time it could possibly do something it also could possibly not ever do anything um so like that just seems so

(2:40:18) silly to me to me and not only that that really still doesn't answer to my question so let me let's try it an

(2:40:24) easier way okay and then can we take yeah yeah drunk so drunk guy right he's drunk but he's not like lost all fine

(2:40:30) motor skills but he's drunk okay she's drunk same thing hasn't lost all fine motor skills but she's definitely drunk

(2:40:37) okay they go home and they have sex mhm now they both graped each other still by your standard okay both of them did we

(2:40:43) agree on that okay okay do we agree on that they did grape each other mhm okay

(2:40:49) I mean I guess it yeah sure so they wake up in the morning they remember all of it mhm okay which drunk people often

(2:40:55) remember what they did the night before that's not uncommon at all they remember all of it and the guy leans over and

(2:41:01) says see you later honey I'm heading off to work and gives her a kiss she goes okay baby that was a lot of fun last night and way to

(2:41:07) go what is actually the harm that happened there what is actually immoral

(2:41:12) about that um I'm sorry is this a couple yeah

(2:41:21) I I think the harm is that again um it

(2:41:26) it's kind of like about the experience that you had with your partner when it comes to engaging in sex like you don't

(2:41:33) you don't really know in terms of your partner's capacity to consent and yeah

(2:41:39) but they both loved it they both claimed to you this was great we had a great time it was fantastic well then I would

(2:41:45) say they weren't drunk they were drunk for sure like leg like Way Beyond the legal way going beyond the legal limit

(2:41:52) and they just remembered what happened the night before as drunk people most often do um what would be the harm I

(2:42:03) mean again I I think the specific instance of the experience is the harm

(2:42:08) like so so let me maybe I can give you another analogy cuz maybe I'm not understanding what you want in terms of

(2:42:14) like things that are like Kinks like BDSM I think there are people who really

(2:42:19) do like um engaging in that kind of of act when the act in itself is like

(2:42:26) harming or hurting your partner and maybe your partner can like that and you can like that but I think there's an

() 

(2:42:32) issue when hurting someone makes you feel good who got

(2:42:39) hurt um well again in terms of like even if your partner likes it you are

(2:42:45) physically hurting them in that capacity correct you haven't demonstrated that they're being hurt by in any capacity

(2:42:51) I'm I'm saying with the example of BDSM well I'm saying in the this example inflicting physical pain examp of BDSM

(2:42:57) sure they like it I'll concede to any of the examples in BDSM that you're harming them hurting them whatever even if they

(2:43:04) say they like it sure tie that into this though how is it that this would actually be demonstrably harmful or in

(2:43:12) some way not okay because the experience that you're having with part your

(2:43:17) partner is incapacitated but you both wanted to be incapacitated

(2:43:23) that that's irrelevant it still you're by the way you're not incapacitated you are like can you sign

(2:43:30) contracts drunk um well legally no why well

(2:43:35) because there could be a threshold there where you're so far beyond it that it's you're incapable of signing something

(2:43:41) why well yeah agree with you on that I agree with you on that contractable because your mental

(2:43:48) cognitive ability is completely impar right so so you're having sex sex with someone who has um to where not only you

(2:43:55) have a mental cognitive impairment and they have a mental cognitive impairment sure and the psych the psychology of

(2:44:03) enjoying that so [ __ ] shouldn't be able to have sex oh my God no I mean honestly [ __ ] shouldn't be allowed to

(2:44:08) have sex um of course but again I don't think comparing people who have um but

(2:44:15) they have limited cognitive ability not to the same to to compare people with uh

(2:44:21) like limited mental ability to drunk people is is that's what your argument is limited cognitive

(2:44:29) ability yes yes limited cognitive ability limited cognitive ability it

(2:44:36) those are differentiated like how someone who has uh disabilities is not

(2:44:41) equal to someone who is drunk I didn't say disability I said they're [ __ ] that that would be a disability

(2:44:47) yeah yeah I'm not talking about like in a wheelchair I'm saying they have a mental cognitive disability kind of like

(2:44:52) they're drunk but they're not drunk but they still don't have great motor skills things like that and they have a lower

(2:44:59) that if we're talking about a spectrum then like drunk is on this side and like limited mental uh cognition um again

(2:45:08) would be a spec Spectrum in terms of someone do they have the capacity to to consent someone who has a mental

(2:45:15) disability to where like they have the the age of someone who's like n or 10

(2:45:21) then yes that would absolutely be an issue they're not allowed to have sex with other people

(2:45:27) have the same mental capacity uh no I I would say that would be an issue as adults yeah even if they

(2:45:33) want to um yeah I mean if if they have the mental cognition of a nine-year-old

(2:45:38) would you would you want nine-year-olds okay so how about they just have a mental capacity sorry can we yeah we'll

(2:45:43) uh we'll take a brief uh we'll do an intermission if you guys want to want to

(2:50:37) point prepared AF thank you uh bit point for that do appreciate your Super Chat Andrew is about to walk up here in just

(2:50:45) a moment he he just he just

(2:50:51) had a mororo red cigarette uh welcome back Kenzie so Kenzie you do uh I'll

(2:51:00) just uh you do like twitch or not twitch Tik Tok debates

(2:51:05) correct good times good times you were going to do like I think you you stopped

(2:51:11) at at two videos on this a whatever podcast companion yeah what well that

(2:51:19) microphone came out of nowhere what happened what happened to the whatever

(2:51:24) podcast companion you stopped at two episodes a little disappointed um well

(2:51:30) um sometimes you want to pour it and then we'll just put it off the table sure sometimes my execution isn't great

(2:51:36) um I did a I I used to do a reaction to

(2:51:42) um do do you know what what live action is live action the anti- uh yeah the

(2:51:49) anti-abortion yeah yeah I used to do a series on them and it felt like I was just kind of reacting to the same things

(2:51:55) over and over you you got to find something more novel whatever podcast

(2:52:00) okay no I mean the the honest answer to your question is just consistency okay

(2:52:05) uh well now that we have you both back here we do have some chat I want to just very quickly point out though that you

() 

(2:52:12) did contradict yourself when you said that disabled people should be allowed and then when they shouldn't be allowed I I I said it depends on um um like

(2:52:19) obviously the capacity like yeah if you have the mental age of a 9-year-old then then no but if you have the mental age

(2:52:25) of an 18-year-old right but you just are impaired to the fact that you are always kind of just in the same capacity as a

(2:52:32) drunk person at 40 and I I don't think that those I think that those are false equivalences

(2:52:38) what's the false equivalence it's the impairment right the impairment is what matters um well no because I I think

(2:52:45) that like being drunk is a different imp parent than maybe having like mental limitations but it is the impairment

(2:52:51) itself that's the problem uh again it's you know when we're talking about people

(2:52:56) who have mental limitations it can be in certain aspects of like understanding

(2:53:01) concepts and cognition not necessarily like the same that you are when you're when you're

(2:53:07) drunk yeah can you just do me one solid and this is kind of a parody right a little bit this is a littlear where

(2:53:14) there I just had I just had this is like a tiny bit of trolling this is right how exciting can you just look at the camera

(2:53:21) and tell every woman out there who's ever been woken up by their husband with sex that their husband's a

(2:53:27) grapest if your husband is having sex with you while you're unconscious your husband is a greatest including if he

(2:53:33) just wakes you up with his penis right he's having sex with you unconscious so they're Grapist right mhm okay I also

(2:53:40) just Brian have you ever huh have you have you ever woke a woman up with sex I'm a virgin Brian have you ever done

(2:53:46) that I'm I'm a virgin hey over there what is a vir what about you bro have you have you ever done it even once have

(2:53:52) you ever woke a chck up with sex bro you had you're so a Grapist there

(2:53:58) Grapist here grap just Grapist well hold on I'm a he just said he a I'm a virgin

(2:54:04) yeah yeah um and wait one was did this also apply like to women too just as a

(2:54:09) point of clarification like if his wife Rachel wakes him up with she already said my wife's a Grapist your his wife

(2:54:15) is a Grapist if if you are if you if you are okay if you are having sex with

(2:54:21) someone who is unconscious then yes you do not have expressed consent wait question though if they uh if they pre

(2:54:29) if they give you permission beforeand they can't because they're impaired they can't retract it right that's the world

(2:54:35) well wait when you're sleeping you're not impaired but I I do think there is issues when it comes to like reversible like do let me let me ask you do you

(2:54:42) think that it's immoral to have sex with someone in a coma yes why has a

(2:54:48) violation of Christian ethics so so that's just it just because

(2:54:54) God says so that isn't that enough of a standard well well no cuz I I want to

(2:54:59) know like what's the so if God said don't wake your wife up with sex then for you it'd be like that would change

(2:55:04) the nature of God done for God to change his mind where does God say in the Bible wake your wife up with sex it well it's

(2:55:12) not implicit doesn't need to be implicit so the thing is though is that uh you

(2:55:18) can find this in Paul where he tells couples not to deprive each other and that couples should not deprive each

(2:55:23) other and so you would say so do you think your wife has an obligation to sleep with you I think we both have an obligation to sleep with each other and

(2:55:29) if she doesn't want to including if I don't want to yes so I'm asking if she doesn't want to

(2:55:36) then yes I think she has an obligation I have an obligation same way do you think you can rape your wife I'm sorry rape

(2:55:42) your wife I think that there is instances where you can yes and what would those instances generally speaking

(2:55:47) violent holding them down doing things like this I think that things like that would be considered C she not upholding

(2:55:55) her Duty that's true she can violate her duty but that doesn't give you a right to hold her down and grape her okay so

(2:56:01) I'm I'm glad we agree that marital grape is the thing that's that's a relief nobody would ever dispute that who has

(2:56:07) reason I I've talked to a lot of Christians who who don't think marital grape is real no okay no uh so we have

(2:56:15) uh thank you Spyro for the superp chat really quick before we get into some of the reads really wait yeah I think there

(2:56:22) I think I have one uh clip posted on my Tik Tok

(2:56:27) like what if they want to do well it doesn't matter all right anyway no please finish your thought well like I

(2:56:35) mean what if they want to like um you know like I don't know sodomizer with

(2:56:41) like an object or something like that they would have to concede then that this would be against the a violation of

(2:56:47) Christian ethics um well I mean they they just think that

(2:56:52) if you're married uh then you have signed a contract I think there is implied consent with marriage yes I uh

(2:56:58) that you've signed a contract that you know your body is your partners in all

(2:57:04) instances under all circumstances I think there's implied consent there but not in all circumstances I mean I I do

(2:57:09) agree that there in um can be implied consent um in terms of like some acts

(2:57:17) sure yeah I okay uh really quick so I just want to shout a couple people out here we can uh

(2:57:24) all right so Anna thank you for the 10 on venmo MC rocker thank you for the 12 on cash app AJ thank for for the one on

(2:57:32) cash app and George thank you for the 10 on cash app guys if you want 100% of your contribution to go towards us you

(2:57:38) can do it through either Veno cash app that's whatever pod now we have a message coming through here we have

(2:57:43) about four of them we have Lucas says up man uh did she just claim

() 

(2:57:51) that uh Homo sapiens realized having sex results and having children only 10,000

(2:57:57) years ago so how did Homo sapiens have babies for the 290 100,000 million preceding years

(2:58:04) 290,000 preceding years preceding years did the stories uh did the STS bring

(2:58:10) them um I'm just saying that men didn't understand their contribution within sex

(2:58:16) I think they did okay I think that there's uh there's a lot they just thought that women just magically became

(2:58:22) pregnant even in like Australian uh I always have a hard time pronouncing I think some tribes did and

(2:58:28) I think that there's good evidence that uh that other people uh even up to if you're if you have the evolutionary

(2:58:34) mindset um there's no reason for us to assume that human beings didn't

(2:58:40) understand that um if I'm not having sex with woman woman not getting pregnant I

(2:58:47) think that that's very simple correlate to make so I do need to move it on to the next one but we have Brooks here he

(2:58:55) says uh based Squad moist Mafia Crucible crew W Andrew and Rachel W Kum Tunes W

(2:59:01) host Brandon whatever W Kiki the show will live in notoriety forever the positive form of notoriety naturally hey

(2:59:10) uh Brooks Josh I think that's from Josh Brooks thank you so much for your message there via streamlabs uh can you hide the super the

(2:59:18) this part so it's not blocking she definitely being a bedroom Ken a lot of people myself included have experienced

(2:59:25) both sides of these actions just say you're boring and can't understand having fun in the bedroom and move on do

(2:59:32) you want to respond to that um sure again I I don't know why

(2:59:38) wanting my partner to be a full cognition and be conscious is me being a Karen well I mean you don't really care

(2:59:44) about that too much though right like if he has two beers he's not fully cognitive at that point he's not drunk

(2:59:51) he's not fully cognitive though he's he's not drunk but he's not fully cognitive and you just said I want him

(2:59:58) to be cogn if he like has

(3:00:05) um like a buzz not not even a buzz um but that's not fully

(3:00:11) cognitive or or like a standard of cognition for sure

(3:00:18) I mean I think you can be buzzed and fully cognitive I yeah I mean I maybe I don't

(3:00:25) no I don't think so I think that it's so going to lower cognition by some degree no matter what prove it is that what I say yeah I

(3:00:33) think I think we can demonstrate that if you have a buzz it's going to to some degree lower cognition no I think it can

(3:00:39) amplify cognition like have do do you bowl yeah I bow yeah uh I bowl so good

(3:00:46) when when I'm a little buz yeah but it could be because lowering your cognition is helpful for some external reasons

(3:00:52) like um I think I have heighten cognition I can just see the pins better maybe or it's possible that you have

(3:00:59) just less inhibitions right or uh less proh prohibit prohibit that you give

(3:01:04) your body when you're bullying or it could be that you trick yourself because your cognition is a little lowered into thinking that you have these skills you

(3:01:10) don't have and so you perform better I just trick myself yeah so you perform better yeah all right we have two more

(3:01:17) chats here here coming in we have Lucas all right let me Venture a guest she's

(3:01:22) got a degree in chender studies or psychology I can't think of a more virent mind virus strand than what spews

(3:01:29) out of a white chick and if you want to read along they're they pop up on the screen uh of a white chick liberal

(3:01:36) feminist thank God for Maga um do you want he says she's or he asks if you

(3:01:42) have a degree in gender studies or psychology I do not okay and I'm not a liberal not a liberal huh okay uh you're

(3:01:49) how do you describe yourself Marxist leftist leftist Mar okay got we have a message from Spyro is it Spiro or Spyro

(3:01:56) it's speo speo do you know these people I know I know that one that gu the name is familiar he says I will demonstrate

(3:02:03) dual grap ISM a burrito cannot speak so it cannot consent to to Brian a burrito

(3:02:09) cannot speak so it cannot ask for Brian's consent don't matter though Brian likes it both ways wow that is

(3:02:16) first off they really do I had a burrito bowl today just to get one thing did it

(3:02:21) cons is that is that a it wasn't it wasn't a burrito it was a bowl inside joke I don't know of yeah yeah they joke

(3:02:28) about my burrito consumption mhm among other things burritos are amazing I'm a

(3:02:33) I'm a fan um okay so we have uh let's see here we got this uh this lady thinks

(3:02:40) theft grape are crimes arising from capitalism and controlled scarcity does

(3:02:45) she realize that these are mentioned in the Ten Commandments long before capitalism ever existed that's from

(3:02:51) graffo TAG thank you graffo tag for that one do you want to respond to I don't know when I ever made the claim that

(3:02:57) like grape is a result of capitalism um I think that capitalism creates certain conditions and so

(3:03:04) obviously when people don't have access to material possessions um then theft is

(3:03:09) going to occur okay all right now we have uh really quick before we just jump

(3:03:15) back into it we have a couple super chats guys we're 30 super chats we're 20 of 5050 30 super chats away from our

(3:03:22) pineapple pizza party and the roast session so H that we don't have to I'll

(3:03:27) probably do it no I'm kidding we I think we should hit it guys we got to hit it we got an hour and 15 minutes about an

(3:03:33) hour and 13 minutes if you want to hit the the pizza party definitely got to hit the pizza party Andrew Andrew

(3:03:39) detests detests pineapple on his pizza so he will if we hit the threshold we he'll

(3:03:45) have one slice you eat it no I'm not eat I'm forc

(3:03:52) Doctrine I guess we're going to see forc Doctrine in real real life we have a super chat here from ichim thank you for

(3:03:59) the Super Chat ichim is she Stupid does didn't she just concede they agreed to

(3:04:04) the delineation was holding them down so by that logic Andrew isn't grape in his example with Rachel do you want to

(3:04:10) respond to this um I I don't think a tenant of grape is that you need to be holding someone down is that what they're

(3:04:16) saying uh yeah she was she was just saying that she was happy that at least I had a

(3:04:21) delineation that there could be marital rape right okay all right that's it for the supers why don't we uh jump into our

(3:04:28) next topic now we kind of veered off into to a couple different paths do you

(3:04:33) guys feel as if we have thoroughly covered feminism I'm fine moving on to

(3:04:39) the next topic because I we could talk more about feminism are you sure is there anything you anything on feminism

(3:04:45) you want to talk about um um I mean what what else is on your list I could give some prompts I mean one of the prompts

(3:04:51) that you had included was the wage gap for example uh if perhaps we can do a

(3:04:57) short segment on wage Gap and then get into some of the I guess the more different well maybe we can save that

(3:05:02) because that's just there's just going to be a disagreement on the empirics so maybe we can save that one can I what um

(3:05:09) okay yeah did we uh okay so why we do we have

(3:05:15) uh a you're prompt abortion free and legal all 9 months legal with legal

(3:05:23) sorry you don't want to oh you do okay um so abortion free and legal all 9 months legal without restrictions so

() 

(3:05:30) does this mean uh up until is there any point

(3:05:36) where yeah so I think it's important to define the term abortion which would be deliberate termination of pregnancy okay

(3:05:42) I think in some cases there can obviously be uh terminations of pregnancy that don't result in the death of the fetus

(3:05:48) um and I would opt for that uh post 24 weeks oh so it's a bit question what a

(3:05:56) disingenuous big question think it's disingenuous so let me make sure that I steal man this properly I just want to

(3:06:02) steal man it I guess it's your turn go ahead I just want to steal Pam sure so it is the case that you're against all

(3:06:09) abortions after 24 weeks if they end the life of the child uh no I think in the

(3:06:17) case obviously to preserve the pr the life of the pregnant person as well as in severe fetal abnormality would be my

(3:06:22) exceptions okay so you have exceptions to it but generally so the vast vast majority of abortions would be immoral

(3:06:29) after 24 weeks um again I I don't think abortion just means lethal outcome if we

(3:06:34) are talking about lethal outcome I I just don't see the the practicality in it yeah I I get it so you're you're

(3:06:41) saying that after um the 24-week mark mhm if if you're going to have an

(3:06:48) abortion because you whatever arbitrary reason you come up with that and you want it to end up in the termination of

(3:06:55) the child and the child's inside you you're not allowed to do that that that would be um that would be murder I would

(3:07:01) classify yeah so then that's it's just a bait question so you don't actually think that there should be un so you're just making a semantic distinction

(3:07:07) you're you're saying this works on Tik Tok all the time too right for the audience yeah go ahead I I will uh give

(3:07:14) you um some cred there that I do think that often that that phrasing of free

(3:07:21) and legal 9 months can be very baiting because of how people view the term abortion um which is why I've also

(3:07:27) included uh without restriction and now on my prompts I just

(3:07:33) do pro-abortion yeah right because you do want restrictions uh no yeah right but only

(3:07:40) because the semantic distinction is something other than what people associate with abortion like Colorado

(3:07:46) doesn't have any legislation regarding abortion and that's what I want I don't want legislation regarding

(3:07:51) abortion none Colorado has none so Canada doesn't have any I believe Washington is another state

(3:07:59) so what happens in Colorado if you do terminate the pregnancy at 8 months uh

(3:08:06) then it would just result in a live birth either a hysterotomy abortion which is similar to a cesarian or an

(3:08:11) induction abortion 6 months uh 30 weeks same thing again it would depend

(3:08:16) specifically on the con like uh obviously um I had a friend uh when we

(3:08:23) were in our 20s um like I told you earlier I live in Montana and any kind of abortion past 24 weeks is illegal so

(3:08:29) she had to travel to Colorado uh because her son had a severe fetal abnormality and he would not uh survive birth yeah I

(3:08:36) get that but if they there is no problems with the pregnancy mhm right

(3:08:42) and there's no direct harm or threat to the mother's Lively or the mother's health MH what happens if you want to

(3:08:48) terminate the pregnancy at 6 months then it would just result in an induction or a

(3:08:53) cesarian but at 6 months that could easily lead to the child's death it it could just like birth could

(3:09:01) you know premature birth could so wouldn't you want there to be legislation against that uh no yeah but

(3:09:07) the chances are significantly higher can you tell me like cuz cuz this is always

(3:09:13) kind of where I get really frustrated with people who are pro-life is kind of expl to me the landscape of someone who

(3:09:19) has waited 30 weeks and then wants an abortion you know no longer to be

(3:09:26) pregnant for any reason yeah okay what's the question can you

() 

(3:09:31) explain the landscape cuz I feel like a lot of pro-lifers just kind of assume that there are people out there who are

(3:09:36) like 30 weeks just wake up like not feeling the pregnancy anymore might as well just go get it taken care of if you

(3:09:44) don't think there's a problem there then why would you be adverse to legislation just enforcing that you can't do because

(3:09:53) legislation creates complications within a very complex medical condition uh

(3:09:58) which we can see uh in uh primarily in Texas especially in

(3:10:04) Idaho to where you know how sick do you need to be how much In Harm's Way do you

(3:10:10) need to be before you can actually get access to an abortion or to to some kind of termination of pregnancy

(3:10:18) okay but legislation can also offer Clarity right it doesn't yeah yeah it can offer Clarity it doesn't it can't or

(3:10:26) does not descriptive I don't see any uh effective

(3:10:32) legislation why do we why do we have laws against murder I again I I think there can be

(3:10:38) instances or certain contexts where it can be specific if you want me to relate

(3:10:44) that to abortion like specifically if we look at tax Texas has uh

(3:10:49) regulations regarding exceptions for life of the mother as well as health of the mother but this has created

(3:10:55) complications because uh the Texas legislature won't give specifics or even

(3:11:01) conditions which would qualify under one second under the exception they were

(3:11:06) sued yeah and asked to do so and the Supreme Court said they didn't have to yeah right so Clarity is your issue but

(3:11:12) you agree with me it's not Clarity no cuz again I I just think pregnancy is so new want and it's so complex that

(3:11:19) legislation cannot effectively do it if we want to talk about like murder is

(3:11:25) also vastly complex extremely nuanced the justifications vary from literally

(3:11:31) municipality to municipality sure so but again I I think the ultimate Authority

(3:11:37) and autonomy is with someone who is uh a medical professional and understands the

(3:11:42) health history of their patient as well as their the the own patient testimony

(3:11:48) of what's Happening well it's not going to be up to them it's going to be up to the person actually having the abortion right uh what do you mean what what well

(3:11:55) it's not up to the medical the medical professional is not making a prescription they're just executing the

(3:12:01) procedure some in some capacities they are making prescriptions in terms of this is what your you know these are

(3:12:07) where your vitals at this is what they this can lead to these are that they want to prevent those are desp what

(3:12:14) we're going to do those are descriptive not prescriptive okay in terms of like what you ought to do okay I'm sorry

(3:12:20) what's your so so what you ought to do is going to be determined by the autonomy of the

(3:12:25) mother um not not necessarily then what's it going to be determined by um I

(3:12:31) mean I I would say like the pragmatics of the situation so who gets to make that decision I think it can be a

(3:12:38) cohesive uh discussion but uh the doctor would have some Authority just like the

(3:12:44) doctor has Authority in terms of you know I go in and I want my leg uh

(3:12:50) amputated there's going to be um con specific context to where the doctor's

(3:12:55) not going to do it I don't I don't disagree with that in a matter prescribed by law but you're saying you

(3:13:01) don't want I don't think that is prescribed by law yeah but it yeah it is you can't T cut off a person's foot

(3:13:06) because they want you to that would be against the hypocrit oath well that hypocracy

(3:13:15) binding yes it is are we talking about like civil law or are we talking about legisla yeah civil law civil law

(3:13:25) um and by the way there are actually specificities too within the medical Market of doctor

(3:13:32) discretion um not being like they can't for instance say no we're not going to

(3:13:38) treat you for the symptoms that you're complaining about they still have to treat you right and I'm sure exclude

(3:13:44) some aspects of treat I'm not even disputing that but in this Cas you're asking for no legislation no no legislation no State

(3:13:52) legislation no federal legislation yeah correct yeah right so if you're saying no federal leg legislation no State

(3:13:59) legislation then the doctor can obvious you can obviously have a Doctor Who's just like I'll just do whatever the

(3:14:04) person's asking me to do that's not happening well yeah cuz it's legislated it's not I I gave you the example of

(3:14:10) yeah you know I I'm curious about this can you pull it up R does Colorado have any abortion law whatsoever can you pull

(3:14:17) that up for me yeah Blake can you uh find US Canada as well um I'm pretty

(3:14:23) sure Washington too no abortion law no abortion law and

(3:14:28) um they actually had a lower abortion rate um up until I want to say 2023 so

(3:14:34) it says here Colorado at least from the AI one of the most abortion friendly states in the United States it's uh

(3:14:41) legal in Colorado all stages of pregnancy constitutional protection 2022 Colorado voters approved prop 79

(3:14:48) enshrined the right to abortion state constitution so there is legislation on abortion that's

(3:14:55) incorrect I think I mean so there's definitely legislation in Colorado what is there in

(3:15:00) Canada um I mean constit like constitutional protections yeah that would definitely

(3:15:08) be the law of the land would be theti um maybe I can be more specific then in

(3:15:14) terms of legislation against abortion because we did just read so you want

(3:15:20) legislation for abortion one second we did just read that the first line was abortion is legal yeah yeah so yes but

(3:15:28) it's legal because it's enshrined in the law because it's constitutionally protected right so I I would be against

(3:15:35) legislative in terms of like making laws against it if I'm sorry if I wasn't specific on that okay so it's just laws

(3:15:42) against it correct okay so what if the termination of the abort or if the

(3:15:48) doctor was willing to perform the abortion in uh such a way where it terminated the

(3:15:53) fetus even at 8 months okay would you be for a law against that

(3:16:00) no no no would that be murder yes but no

(3:16:06) punishment correct how is that morally consistent that's like the most monstrous thing I've ever heard so I

() 

(3:16:12) think this is where like a UT a utilitarian position would come into is that that um I when we look at abortion

(3:16:21) post 21 weeks even in states that have um all legal protections towards abortion um it's 1% of abortions and

(3:16:30) then when we look at that 1% even further it's prior to 28 weeks so post

(3:16:35) 28 weeks I think a lot of pro-lifers just kind of make like up these ideas that people want to come in and just

(3:16:42) have lethal terminations for no reason this is all descriptive you're just talking yeah if I can finish yeah but

(3:16:48) this is descriptive I'm asking about prescriptive right so I'm I'm getting there so um what I'm saying is that this

(3:16:56) is a non-existent uh at worst and rare event

(3:17:02) at best and in terms of the deaths of fetuses within this criteria that is

(3:17:08) going to be less than the deaths of pregnant people who are denied abortions who are medically necessary and so which

(3:17:16) one would I rather have I would rather have more people live which would be the pregnant

(3:17:21) people okay so um I'm still really confused here but maybe you can give me some clar some clarity you are aware

(3:17:29) that in uh Russia abortion was also legal under first wave feminism going

(3:17:37) into communism right what time period uh would you like the exact dates yeah yeah

(3:17:42) so I think that this was um roughly hang on let me pull pull it

(3:17:49) up I got it in my notes here [Music]

(3:17:55) um USSR was the first country to make abortion fully legal up to term and paid

(3:18:00) for in state hospitals within 10 years of implementing that policy they had three abortions for every one live birth

(3:18:05) and they had to Outlaw abortion again again what time frame um I'm trying to pull the dates up here sure

(3:18:13) yeah hang on

(3:18:24) I didn't write the date down for that I'm I'm just wondering essentially

(3:18:29) against like the conditions looks like around uh 1920 1920 yeah later

(3:18:35) restricted the band in 36 because of this problem so it was 1920 through 36

(3:18:41) right around roughly the same exact time as what other amendment was 1920 you

(3:18:47) know um Amendment the United States 1920 the the right to vote yeah yeah so sorry

(3:18:52) are you saying that's correlated some no no no I just think it's interesting that the right to vote and feminism because

(3:18:59) in the 20s it was roaring and same thing in in Russia but they had three abortions for every one life birth they

(3:19:04) had outlawed literally had outlawed they didn't re that was that was a a time

(3:19:09) where Russia was a pretty warn torn country wasn't it because Stalin was overthrowing the uh Monarch regime in

() 

(3:19:16) the buik yeah they need they definitely needed to have human beings they they knew that but that was the problem is is

(3:19:22) that if you have three to one in the Live Verse you can't sustain the nation so when they reintroduced it in 56 it

(3:19:29) looks like that's the time period that they they Rel legalized it was in 56 had significant regulations on it to prevent

(3:19:35) that from happening so hang on so I'm just saying the reason I bring this up okay is because you claim well

(3:19:40) descriptively this isn't happening now okay but descriptively it was happening

(3:19:45) when it was allowed without laws against it so I have actual evidence so again like I obviously this

(3:19:53) can be conditional outcomes uh depending on certain things do you think that the

(3:19:58) sooner you have an abortion the better I mean I don't see how

(3:20:04) um like from my specific worldview from the secular worldview cuz I always think

(3:20:09) abortion is wrong oh okay um so that that that would be one of my argumentations is that if you were

(3:20:16) having um essentially a society to where medical access wasn't available um or it

(3:20:22) was at a high cost then this could delay uh obviously your opportunity to get an abortion which may cause it in later St

(3:20:29) stages of pregnancy yeah that's rare what do you mean that in later stages of

(3:20:35) pregnancy you're going to have abortions right isn't that what you said no um I it is rare because access is available

(3:20:41) so I'm saying if it's happening later in pregnancy it's most likely because there are times where access is not not

(3:20:47) available yeah okay so from but from your view you're you're just saying like

(3:20:53) cuz you don't see a distinction right you just think life begins in some arbitrary Point like 24 weeks or

(3:20:58) something tied in with Consciousness or something silly right something silly um

(3:21:03) well it is silly because you can't define consciousness it's not a definable thing I mean do you think you

(3:21:08) have a subjective experience sure but that's not def sub exp not defining Consciousness what is that subjective

(3:21:14) experience made of I don't I have no idea you what's it made of I think it's made of a lot of different components of

(3:21:20) things but the fact that you recognize that it exists doesn't Define what it is and what what do you mean what what kind

(3:21:26) of definition do you want well tell me what Consciousness is the ability to have experiences yeah

(3:21:32) so um are you saying that you have no experiences when you're

(3:21:38) unconscious um well I think there's other aspects of experience that not just only go in so you are having

(3:21:44) experiences even when you're unconscious uh well I don't think Consciousness and

(3:21:49) being conscious are necessarily the same thing they're not uh no like I I wouldn't say that

(3:21:59) um like someone who is sleeping doesn't have Consciousness even though that you

(3:22:05) don't believe that um when you're sleeping you're completely unconscious I'm sorry what you said earlier you

(3:22:11) don't believe when you're sleeping you're completely unconscious when we're we're talking

(3:22:16) about grape you're completely unconscious yeah you said you didn't believe that you're completely unconscious when you

(3:22:23) sleep you are unconscious that that was my main tenant is that you're having sex with someone who's unconscious okay so

(3:22:29) then if you're not unconscious if you are unconscious when you're sleep are you experiencing things when you sleep

(3:22:35) yes you can still experience stimula and how could you be unconscious because of other qualia uh qualia sensation

() 

(3:22:43) emotions I mean your ability to dream if Consciousness then is defined as one who

(3:22:49) has hang on if Consciousness is is expressed as one who has experiences

(3:22:55) iang on I'm sorry can we can we get back no we can't I I just want to make we pivoted from no we really didn't pivot

(3:23:01) you pivoted it here no no you said arbitrarily at 24 weeks that's a different subject than what we were talking about yeah but I just table that

(3:23:08) but I want to only take one second okay fine Consciousness one who has

(3:23:15) experiences is conscious if you're having experience when you're unconscious then you can't

(3:23:21) be UNC then you must have Consciousness even when you're unconscious

(3:23:27) right um yes there there are aspects that you can have Consciousness when you are unconscious I don't so are you

(3:23:33) actually unconscious yes cuz I think unconscious um and Consciousness are different

(3:23:39) what's different I have no consciousness or I do what what is what is being conscious to you I don't well it's not a

(3:23:45) thing again that that's definable really I'm just in terms of so you when your

(3:23:51) wife is sleeping that's as good as she's awake what do you mean in terms of

(3:23:57) conscious and unconscious yeah I think that she still has Consciousness when she's sleeping

(3:24:03) yes even though she's unconscious right well she's not no she's not I don't think she's unconscious I think she's

(3:24:09) knocked out what's the difference well this is the thing about Consciousness like I said it's not definable I think

(3:24:15) therefore I am is the we can come up with but we agree on what that when

(3:24:21) you're sleeping you're still have Consciousness I agree with that even though you're not from your world yeah

(3:24:27) from my world view that makes sense from your world view that makes no sense why does that make sense from your world view because you're the one who's making

(3:24:32) the determination as to when life begins it's 24 weeks because of Consciousness what do we mean by life Consciousness

(3:24:40) what do you mean by life doesn't I'm doing an internal critique then you can do your internal CRI it does because we do like obviously there's different

(3:24:48) um new there's different terms when we talk about like the mode of life like I'm sure you would recognize that

(3:24:54) cellular Division and metabolic life is very different than someone having a subjective experience I agree it's human

(3:25:01) life you agree it's human life yes great there's no disagreement there what what

(3:25:06) I'm saying that's before 24 weeks but it is different than someone having a conscious experience or a subjective

() 

(3:25:13) experience it's to you it's why is that not different for because you for you that's the thing you value not the life

(3:25:19) itself well yeah without a subjective experience there's no Society right right but the problem is is that you

(3:25:25) can't demonstrate there's no subjective experience before 24 weeks so that's that's that's one and two even if you

(3:25:32) could say there's no subjective experience before 24 weeks Consciousness itself is the one thing that human

(3:25:39) beings really don't understand very well okay we just really don't understand it at all so it's not easy to Define we

(3:25:46) don't know why we have it it makes no real sense right it's a thing not well understood so it the reason I point out

(3:25:53) that it's arbitrary is because it's kind of impossible to prove that there's no subjective experience before 24 weeks in

(3:25:59) a fetus it's just like impossible to prove that um I mean I agree I guess I guess

(3:26:05) it's in kind of the I classify it as like the same um as like puberty like

(3:26:10) obviously there are certain metrics that you hit when you have reached puberty but when does someone like go through

(3:26:16) puberty or experience puberty or how long does puberty take is going to be different so sure metric yeah I I don't

(3:26:23) disagree yeah so that was my whole point is like you came up with a 24- we arbitrary metric um I think in

(3:26:31) some instance like there there are going to be some instances where yes things are arbitrary it's just you just have to

(3:26:37) draw a line somewhere okay so so we'll we'll table that we know it's arbitrary I'm glad that we got the semantics taken

(3:26:42) care of so that we understand no I'm sorry I and then it didn't seem like we agreed and then moving forward well we kind of

(3:26:48) do but moving forward from there right I would still like to know why it is on

(3:26:53) the legislation end MH uh and then we can just move the topic because there's a bunch of them I want to get to when we

(3:26:58) only have so much time but I just want to know when it comes when it comes to legislation they did not legislate there

(3:27:05) and it did actually descriptively lead to an increase in the number of abortions that happened there was no

(3:27:11) regulation on it and it was a 3 to1 against life burst that's obviously very unhealthy for everybody that's not good

(3:27:17) right so I have the descriptive claim that that already happened when there was no legislation um what what would be your

(3:27:23) demonstration here like you think established like a causal that it well

(3:27:29) without abortions there wouldn't have been abortions yeah that's pretty causal well in terms of like what is the reason

(3:27:36) that people are terminating pregnant so so let let me put it who cares why they're determined they're I think that

() 

(3:27:41) really um is a huge assessment that we have to make in terms of uh if we want abortion to reduce so

(3:27:49) if you and I are on the same goal that we want to reduce abortions then having legislation against abortion red does

(3:27:55) that uh no I I would just say it just uh limits access to Safe abortions if we're

(3:28:01) going to actually pragmatically reduce abortion I would say that we would want to prevent unwanted pregnancy which

(3:28:07) would be through comprehensive sex health education which would be through long acting reversible

(3:28:13) contraceptives um so that would be one way to prevent it if if we're going to when people get pregnant give them more

(3:28:19) options to where they want to or feel like they have the capability to take care of another child that would be

(3:28:25) thing like Access to Health Care access to uh paid parental leave access to

(3:28:32) subsidized daycare those things would actually meaningful meaningfully reduce

(3:28:37) abortion um legation huh so with legislation it it doesn't it does and

(3:28:43) You by you actually conceded to this in the first statement you made so here's what you said you said it limits your

(3:28:50) access to Safe abortions do you do you think that if abortions are unsafe more or less people will have

(3:28:57) them um if abortions are unsafe more or less people will have them um more or

(3:29:02) less women will have them if they're unsafe I

(3:29:08) think I I I don't it it's hard to gauge if it would

(3:29:14) be more or less cuz I think someone has an abortion I I would say less women

(3:29:19) would have an abortion less yeah so then necessarily

(3:29:24) legislating against abortions equals less abortions um it just

(3:29:31) equals less abortions in in some aspects yes and in others no no in all aspects

(3:29:39) yes because if there's one less abortion than there was yesterday and there would

(3:29:44) ordinarily have been one more abortion today if that um would not have happened had you not legislated yesterday then

(3:29:51) there is less abortion okay correct sure yeah so then legislating does it would

(3:29:57) it would really depend cuz I think like obviously in Texas um there has been

(3:30:02) restrictions on abortion and we just see people flee to other states where abortion is legal and then also in Texas

(3:30:09) as well I would argue that like with the heartbeat bill when it was 6 weeks because people had such a short window

(3:30:16) to decide if they could get would want an abortion or have a child that they aired on the side of caution and had an

(3:30:21) abortion yeah so the legislation in fact increased abortions because if people would have had more time but what if

(3:30:27) there was no would have decided to to actually carry the child to term well

(3:30:33) here's my reputation to both those arguments the first is all that that would do is signify to me that you put a

(3:30:40) legislation at conception uh and don't give people an opportunity you're not pregnant at conception

(3:30:46) yeah you can still make the legislation at conception so if so so then would iuds be illegal well no just the

(3:30:53) conception of the pregnancy whatever that is right whatever you want is different from okay fine whatever the

(3:30:59) semantic distinction is I'm just saying it's not a semantic distinction okay were you confused about what I said yes

(3:31:06) okay when does a woman get pregnant implantation okay so whenever that is whenever a woman gets pregnant maybe I

(3:31:12) misspoke whenever a woman gets pregnant okay you could just legislate right then and there that's when life begins you're

(3:31:18) not allowed to have an abortion so you can legislate against abortion effectively before the six we marker you can just say nope not allowed period

(3:31:26) okay right so that would uh significantly limit those because you say people are just panicking because

(3:31:31) they have a narrower window I'm saying take the window out and then they won't Panic you just can't do it so then you say well they flee to other states where

(3:31:38) abortion is legal mhm okay fair enough so then if you made abortion illegal in those States abortion would drastically

(3:31:44) reduce as well necessarily sure yeah so in both cases it seems like we can

(3:31:51) greatly reduce abortion regardless of making it criminal in fact it's going to

(3:31:56) reduce I I would say that having a more pragmatic approach uh would be number

(3:32:01) one more effective because we would see better outcomes um and again you you just

(3:32:07) really lose me on uh regulating a woman's autonomy I think if we're going to give anyone the choice to determine

(3:32:14) uh family planning to determine uh health risks to determine um mental

(3:32:21) health then than it would be the person who's who's carrying the pregnancy I literally made the argument earlier that

(3:32:27) you care about the woman's autonomy and you said no the doctor also he has the authority and say that wait wait that

(3:32:34) that was a that was a different delineation we're talking about in terms of the procedure that you're having which is an abortion there's no

(3:32:39) different there's different abortion procedures so I thought that's what we were talking about because obviously if we're if you're in the third termination

(3:32:46) or I'm sorry in the third trimester there are different methods that you can um enact in order to terminate the

(3:32:52) pregnancy so when it came to that method yes obviously the doctor can have the authority on that but when it came to

(3:32:59) the decision yes that that is the patient yeah why shouldn't why shouldn't we be allowed to limit women's autonomy

(3:33:06) just like we limit men's autonomy by sending them off to war um I just don't see the justification for it I don't see

(3:33:11) the justification for sending men off to war but it is necessary but it is necessary

(3:33:17) uh I I disagree I don't think it's necessary you don't no okay got it so then if your nation was invaded and Men

(3:33:23) didn't want to fight your nation gets taken over that's that right yeah so basically there's no Duty

(3:33:31) for men to in any way fight in a compelled way I mean having a duty is different than than being forced to um

(3:33:38) to do something yes absolutely okay I I would think if if this is Central to your society and and um then yeah people

(3:33:46) would step up and want to do it if they don't cuz they're

(3:33:52) scared okay yeah they're scared I mean they're scared right but I mean you do realize that many many many nations they

(3:34:00) have compelled service I think again like when we when we go back to this idea of like engaging in War I think we

(3:34:06) need to have a critique on society in general um well we don't even need to do

(3:34:13) that I'll just grant for you I think we do well I'm granting it for you you I'm just going to grant for you okay you're

(3:34:18) right there should be no compelled service that still doesn't actually answer though why autonomy is the thing

(3:34:24) in which we should we should not limit autonomy for people why not I think there can be instances where we limit

(3:34:29) autonomy um but I just don't see a reason for for abortion well I think you do you've

() 

(3:34:36) already expressed multiple times that there would how is it ethical to force someone to sustain pregnancy after 6

(3:34:41) months yeah so what if it's going to kill the

(3:34:47) baby okay I don't think that they have an obligation to give their uh for them

(3:34:54) to have their body used as life support So then at 9 months they can kill their baby again we would just terminate the

(3:35:01) connection so they their labor would just be induced and you do the purpose

(3:35:07) of abortion is centered around pregnancy so if you want pregnancy to end there's a lot of different ways we can do that

(3:35:13) and obviously there's no necessity in killing the fetus once

(3:35:21) you're what do you mean like for instance you you claim that the mom has

(3:35:26) bodily autonomy right and that shouldn't be violated MH and the bodily autonomy is that the baby needs to use her

(3:35:34) body right okay so what happens if the baby's born the mom doesn't want to feed the baby well um babies are fed with bre

(3:35:42) milk right sure sure so I think uh we we need to decide what are individual responsibilities and more societal

(3:35:49) responsibilities it's about autonomy I thought it I I haven't even finished so when we talk about uh societal

(3:35:56) responsibilities obviously if a parent um doesn't want to take care of their child then they would become Award of

() 

(3:36:02) the state and then the state would take on those responsibilities of caring for the child I don't understand why can't

(3:36:09) the mom just choose to not feed the baby until the baby expires what do you mean

(3:36:14) is she taking on the parental role yeah well she had the baby okay she had it

(3:36:20) okay let's say she had it at her prom she was like she had it at her prom yeah she was outside she had a a prom night

(3:36:26) dumpster baby as Family Guy would would reference it terrible okay she had a prom night dumpster baby what and so

(3:36:33) anyway she has the baby okay this is important it's actually an important distinction so anyway she has the baby

(3:36:38) and the dumpster is an important distin she doesn't want to feed it she just doesn't want to because it's her body

(3:36:43) and it's her autonomy so she just let to die so um if we are once the baby is

(3:36:52) born yeah um as a society uh obviously the care for the child needs to be

(3:36:59) determined yeah so at that point um the mother can either claim the parental

(3:37:04) responsibility and which comes with all the obligations of obviously feeding the child or um if they don't claim it then

(3:37:11) obviously that baby would be a war of the state so now the mother's is in possession of a baby that's not hers so

(3:37:19) I think in order to avoid kidnapping charges are harms towards Award of the state she has she she needs to turn it

(3:37:26) over to the state so she has a duty to turn the baby over to the state without correct because she's in possession of a

(3:37:32) ward of the state so it's essentially uh almost a kidnapping charge okay so I want to make sure I get this right so

(3:37:39) the mother if she says this baby is mine then she has the obligation to breastfeed it right

(3:37:48) um I mean I I wouldn't I would say uh breastfeeding would be a reasonable obligation but why why is there not

(3:37:55) formula well because formula is extremely unhealthy for babies well I mean formula is what has

(3:38:03) um like saved the lives of of babies yes when there's no you know their mom's

(3:38:08) breast milk around sure right a lot of women don't have the capacity to breastfeed no most of them have the capacity to breastfeed they do a lot of

(3:38:15) women struggle with a lot yes you can even make that claim cuz I would say a lot is like 1% of women would be a lot

(3:38:21) do do you think that if a mother chooses not to breastfeed that she's harming her child well no what well yeah but what

(3:38:28) I'm looking at is do you think that's to the degree of neglect um I'm not saying I'm not saying

(3:38:35) that it's neglectful there could be reasons for it including ignorance there could be just like ignorance like should

(3:38:40) she she retain uh custody even if she doesn't under most cases probably yes

(3:38:46) because she's feeding the baby through but I think that the it I think that there should be a state mandatory

(3:38:51) propaganda campaign that mother should breastfeed their children yes should she receive legal consequences if she

(3:38:57) chooses not to if she had the capacity to do so and decided to give the kid poison instead yeah probably well I'm

(3:39:03) not not so when you say poison you mean formula yeah okay and comparon the breast milk it's poison okay so when

(3:39:11) like you get most of your immune system from your mother's breast mil sure sure um when when the child is born you

(3:39:17) acknowledge that breast smoke has not come in uh

(3:39:23) no no okay so breast smoke hasn't necessarily come in once the child is

(3:39:29) born um and if you don't most of the time breast milk has been there before the child's born uh no yeah there's uh I

(3:39:37) believe it's called colostrum which is not the same as breast milk it's more like a clear liquid how do you think

(3:39:42) babies used to eat well one second because this is the process that I had to go through when I gave birth like I

(3:39:48) breastfed for8 months and it took um I think at least 36 hours before my breast

(3:39:54) milk came in after birth and so when you have that Cho when

(3:39:59) parents make that decision you mean after the colostrum correct

(3:40:05) yeah Lord so how do how do babies eat what one second so if if you don't uh

(3:40:12) essentially start engaging in nursing uhhuh then then you don't know your capacity for lactation so I'm asking if

(3:40:20) once birth happens and the doctor's like are you going to breastfeed or wish should get formula yeah is there some

(3:40:26) kind of legal obligation for you that the mother tries to breastfeed I I don't understand what are

(3:40:32) you asking me after birth yeah do you think women should be forced to attempt

(3:40:37) to nurse I think that there should be nursing as soon as it's possible to nurse well that's that's a yes or a no

(3:40:43) do you think women should be forced to nurse post maybe not okay so so then it would need

(3:40:49) to be within the confines of Reason well how how would you ever then like say that someone can have legal consequence

(3:40:55) for not nursing after birth okay so I see what you're saying

(3:41:00) now let me get this right there is a thing a small Gap or a small possible

(3:41:06) window where you can't breastfeed after baby born right you can't breastfeed can't

(3:41:14) you you can nurse but it's not um fully breast milk yeah okay so you can breastfeed you

(3:41:22) can nurse but again it's not fully breast milk it's not the Complete

(3:41:27) Nutrition bab getting is the baby eating um not in the complete way that breast

(3:41:33) milk does because that that is something that that is something that you do

(3:41:39) monitor with your doctor because they want to make sure okay so I see we're speaking past each other so let's back up when you put your nipple in the

(3:41:47) baby's mouth is the baby getting food it depends most of the time um in adequate

(3:41:54) amount that's debatable but some and how early do they usually start getting an adequate amount within it depends um

(3:42:02) again it's I had my son quite a while ago um I want to say mine came in around 36 weeks or I'm sorry 36 hours but so

(3:42:09) three days um was a day and a half day and a half yeah but again I I think other it's just you know when what when

(3:42:17) does puberty occur it just depends so hang on so let's back up so milk your full breast milk comes in

(3:42:25) within a day um yeah could be a couple days could be a day sure I was just reading the

(3:42:30) reason I said three days is because it said it said 3:00 to 5 when I was looking up on the colostrum right but it's it can be as early as 12 hours

(3:42:37) maybe yeah and I um I think even some of my friends have had breast smoke before birth yeah I don't I don't see any problem with feeding the baby that yeah

(3:42:44) that seems fine so I'm just but if you don't um begin nursing MH then you would essentially

(3:42:52) inhibit that process to where you you just never produce bre milk so you

(3:42:58) should start doing that then so I'm asking you should mothers be forced to

(3:43:04) nurse postbirth even though we don't know their capacity to breastfeed yes so

(3:43:10) you think women should be forced to breast all right the problem with that

(3:43:15) is what you have accepted responsibility for the baby right by your worldview yes

(3:43:22) but obvious you have an obligation to feed the baby so then yeah and obviously

(3:43:27) you there are other means which you can feed the baby yeah poisonous means they are still other means so feed do you

(3:43:34) think that feeding kids poison is a good idea I think kids that are fed is best

(3:43:39) absolutely so you just like you would you give the baby like straight [ __ ] chocolate because it's of course not why

(3:43:47) because um breast milk and formula require are essentially the only liquids

(3:43:53) at that point where an infant can get their full nutritional profile you're not getting your full nutritional profile though I mean you you are

(3:44:02) otherwise you would die not though you're not no you you wouldn't necessarily mean you die but it it would

(3:44:07) inhibit the develop your brain it would inhibit the devop bra I'm not interested in having a discussion between formula

(3:44:14) and and breast which one do you think is better for the baby I think fed is best but um I opted for that's not what I

(3:44:20) asked what a cop out which one is better for the baby I opted to breastfeed

(3:44:27) why CU it was cheaper and you thought it was better for the baby right yes yeah so then the

(3:44:33) thing is is like why couldn't I compel you to do that or shouldn't I be able to I think it should be like obviously the

(3:44:40) person's will I think will should be but now you're in charge of somebody else like if I I fed my kid chocolate every

(3:44:46) single day as his only source of nutrition wouldn't you Advocate that the state came in and took that kid from

(3:44:53) me um if you fed them chocolate every day no that's all I fed them is

(3:44:58) chocolate mhm um I mean if if they were starving yeah

(3:45:05) yeah so depriving I mean I guess I guess at what degree are we deciding that parents have their CH or parents have

(3:45:11) their children taken away based on their diet we don't always know what's optim but in this in this case we do actually know

(3:45:18) it's optimal wouldn't that be arbitrary in in the one case sure but in this case

(3:45:23) no we actually do know what's optimal here so I I think if we're talking about like what we would want to

(3:45:31) happen um I I agree with you that like breast milk is great and it's the

(3:45:36) optimal choice I don't think someone should be forced to do why not seems like good idea to force them to if

(3:45:42) you're going to take possession of your child I don't see any problem with them telling you that hey because it's your

(3:45:47) body so I mean so I think obviously then the other alternative would you have an issue if

(3:45:54) they pump no and then and then breast but that's the same thing breast mold

(3:45:59) okay yeah that's the most optimal thing to give them right I I think again this would just relate down to autonomy

() 

(3:46:05) because obviously everyone's conditions are different yeah but in this case you have a dependent I think more women

(3:46:10) would breastfeed if we had more social safety nets when it comes to women giving birth yeah but I also think they

(3:46:17) would breastfeed if they say you need to breastfeed this child you must I think

(3:46:22) it's just an an unreasonable so what what if your child think it's the most reasonable what if your child needed

(3:46:28) blood would you be obligated would would do you want legal laws that parents are

(3:46:34) forced to give them their blood yeah and the problem with this in society would be what what about kidney no so where

(3:46:42) where are you draw why are you drawing the line there I draw it the same place that you would on the idea that if it's going to kill you a kid getting rid of

(3:46:49) your kidney wouldn't kill you oh yeah it's going to lead to your demise much faster it wouldn't kill you though yes it would that's killing you it's not you

(3:46:57) can survive with one kidney for yes for less time than you can survive with do kill that's killing you I mean you could

(3:47:03) say the same thing about blood okay so just to make sure that this is correct if I said I'm going to take off 10 years

(3:47:09) of your life I'm not killing you no you're not directly killing me oh you are limiting my life expectancy sure so

(3:47:15) if I took your life down to tomorrow I'm not killing you um if you took my life down to

(3:47:23) tomorrow what are you doing or 10 minutes that's not killing you if I

(3:47:29) could just like again again so if we're talking about like direct cause obviously things have chain link

(3:47:35) reactions so are you just saying like you do anything you're responsible for any Link in the chain or are we talking

(3:47:42) about what I'm saying that your duties to your children need comport with reason and so I think that you can make

(3:47:47) at least a strong enough case if there's an alternative food source I don't think hang on I think that you can make a

(3:47:53) strong enough case that if no other blood was present uh to give from donors

(3:47:58) that a parent had a duty and obligation to give their blood to a child hang on to a child and that would comport with

(3:48:04) reason just fine whereas it could it may not comport to reason to say that this

(3:48:10) could have dire effects on your health giving them a kidney that might that's a whole different

(3:48:16) situation I mean I I don't think it is because you you would even say like um

(3:48:21) pregnancy can come with severe Health complications that can reduce your life expectancy yeah sure sir so then I don't

(3:48:29) have to do that now no you still have to do that yeah then then that's is inconsistent what's the inconsistency

(3:48:34) you just said I don't have to give the kidney because that comes with health complications that red my it's not because it comes with health

(3:48:40) complications uh it's because this particular complication demonstrated to always shorten Life Pregnancy is not in

(3:48:46) fact pregnancy has been demonstrated to elongate life if there's one instance where someone gives a kidney and it

(3:48:52) doesn't demonstrate a shorter life expectancy then it's okay how could you demonstrate that I don't know how are

(3:48:58) you demonstrating that it always does yeah the only way that we're demonstrating that aren't these just

(3:49:03) typical outcomes well we can just compare people who give kidneys to people who don't give kidneys and then you can just correlate the lifespan

(3:49:10) simple but that doesn't mean always yeah it's almost always the case but it

(3:49:15) doesn't mean always there could be some exception just like in pregnancy so the same thing singing here's the thing

(3:49:21) though if there's a single exception to something that doesn't mean we wouldn't legislate based on the general rule but

(3:49:26) then your your stand because have an exception biologically to anything because your standard is inconsistent the standard's still consistent I think

(3:49:32) if you and I are going to establish what a parental obligation is or responsibility it's just going to be

(3:49:39) arbitrary yeah but okay to to what severe degree does a parent need to

() 

(3:49:44) exper you make the case of arbitr then you can say everything is arbitrary the age of

(3:49:49) consent is arbitrary right there are a lot of things that are is the age of consent arbitrary what do you mean is

(3:49:55) the age of consent I don't want to Pivot I I can you answer my question I'm checking you for your consistency and

(3:50:01) arbitr you for being your consistency and I'm happy to answer but if when you say when you say a thing is AR because

(3:50:07) we're talking about what's arbitrary so if you say thing is arbitrary almost everything is arbitrary we already

(3:50:13) agreed that essentially establishing when Consciousness occurred is arbitrary yeah but I'm talking now I'm saying is a

(3:50:19) is the age of consent arbitrary in terms of what in terms of there's no if the

(3:50:24) age of consent is 16 no that's not arbitrary it's obviously how did you come up with it being

(3:50:30) 16 um I mean that that would depend on the reasoning so it's

(3:50:36) arbitrary in in some cases sure but if it is the case and I grant to you that

(3:50:41) hey no it's not arbitrary because you're 16 then no it's not arbitrary that you don't have to give kidney but you do have to give blood that's not arbitrary

(3:50:48) now it is how are you like selecting at what degree the parent has to experience

(3:50:54) in order for that how are you selecting the age of consent um I think we can obviously have markers when it comes to the age of con

(3:51:01) so we can have delineations between harm factors where we can comport them to reason when it comes to giving blood or

(3:51:07) kidneys simple do you think parents have an obligation to like experience torture

(3:51:14) in order to keep their children alive uh I think that you can make the case that

(3:51:19) a father or mother should have some Duty towards trying to experience or not trying to experience it but that they

(3:51:26) may need to suffer in order to keep their kid alive yeah I don't disagree

(3:51:31) but I'm asking is that like a legal expectation that we will torture you to keep your child alive that's a moral

(3:51:38) expectation then so obviously but you do want to um

(3:51:45) have laws that would require parents to be tortured to keep their children alive

(3:51:50) what's the torture I mean Force pregnancy is torture how is that

(3:51:55) torture um well I mean it's classified as as torture by the UN I would say it would just meet a specific threshold of

(3:52:04) um suffering okay well then I would say that it's torturing the

(3:52:10) baby so like because you're going to kill it I would say that that's a form of torture or I could even say it's

(3:52:16) mental torture on the mother to terminate the pregnancy could have long-term side effects on her mental

() 

(3:52:21) health that only depends on how wanted the pregnancy is um and again if you don't like have the capacity to

(3:52:27) experience I don't know how you can experience torture yeah but not only that you know what's really weird about this argument specifically is like do

(3:52:34) you have an obligation to be tortured on behalf of your children right it's like

(3:52:39) well let's look at this let's examine it on the on the one side I I do want to say yes I think you do and I think you

(3:52:45) even agree that to some degree we do but for some reason you're like unless it's inside my stomach which is really weird

(3:52:52) what do you mean well you said you just got done saying that you think to some degree parents need to be able to

(3:52:58) experience suffering for their children that they will experience suffering do I think they should be forced to no

(3:53:05) never no I'm I can't think of an an instance like oh I don't know um your

(3:53:12) kid for instance uh has autism or something like this right you still need to take care of that kid give him

(3:53:18) special treatment things like that that definitely causes suffering um not to the same degree that

(3:53:25) I would say violations towards your bodily autonomy would be that is violations toward your body autonomy force one second and I would I I

(3:53:32) disagree with that I wouldn't Force um if if a parent uh can't meet the needs

(3:53:39) of the child then um I think that would be a societal responsibility so then it just you just shift the burden yeah I

(3:53:46) don't want to force parents to be parents I want that to be done willingly because that's the best outcome for the

(3:53:52) child so if nobody gave blood let's say hypothetically just nobody gave blood right do you think that the parent has

(3:53:58) the obligation to give their kid blood if they're in I think they should but I don't think that uh it should be legally

(3:54:03) enforced so then the kid just dies if the parent doesn't want to yeah yeah I

(3:54:09) don't know that sounds like a way shittier Society to me I I don't know do you think like um if the child is

(3:54:14) starving that like the parent has an obligation to cut off parts of their skin to feed their child I think that if

(3:54:19) you were crash landed somewhere like on a desert island or something like that there's a moral obligation to do so yeah

(3:54:26) we're talking legal yeah I could I can't make a legal prescription there for something that very very clearly would

(3:54:33) be like outside of society so you think that parents should be they should they

(3:54:40) should what cut off parts of their skin to feed their child if they absolutely had no other way to feed that child I

(3:54:46) think they have a moral obligation to do so okay moral you agree

(3:54:51) right um I again I think it has to would you cut off pieces of your skin to feed

(3:54:57) your child in a plane wreck yes yeah okay then that's the end of that I mean that's what I would do yeah because you

(3:55:02) thinkal but that's my will because you think it's moral it's like the most moral thing you could do

(3:55:08) right um sure but again I I don't think that my like moral desires

(3:55:14) um would necessarily uh be imposed on other people like U

(3:55:21) I've had I've had an abortion as well you would say that a woman who wouldn't do that for their kid was a bad

(3:55:28) person I would say someone who does that is a good person so somebody who didn't do that was probably not a good person I

(3:55:35) I don't think if you're not a good person it doesn't mean you're a bad person yeah that's not what I asked

(3:55:40) though are they a bad person no no no okay do you think like if you are

(3:55:46) walking down a path and you see someone drowning you have an obligation to save them

(3:55:51) yeah do you think that you should be legally criminalized I think in some cases you are legally criminalized if if

(3:55:59) so what if you can't swim well there's States for instance where there's a law where if there's a felony in progress or a misdemeanor in progress and you don't

(3:56:05) report you go to jail sure I can you know the same I think that's

(3:56:10) very it's it's not though cuz obviously it comes down to like what um is

(3:56:16) reasonable expectation is it a reasonable expectation that you make a phone call sure reasonable expectation

(3:56:23) fre water when you can't when you can't s now you're loading it though now you're loading it fine warm bath water

(3:56:28) let me ask you this let's reverse it okay now the kid is drowning in a

(3:56:34) puddle should should you face some sort of criminal charges if you don't go over and just roll them out of the puddle

(3:56:40) yeah again I think that then what are you even talking about what do you mean so yes I think that there you can have

(3:56:46) moral obligations with thresholds sure I don't disagree yeah but that was my point with kidneys and blood you can

(3:56:52) have moral obligations with thresholds yes I think you should be able to force people to give blood so what the Del

(3:56:58) then what's the delineation I don't you're engaging in a fallacy right now so what's the fallacy yeah so the I I

(3:57:05) don't remember what this one's called but the specific fallacy that you're engaging in is because you say this

(3:57:10) thing you can't you don't have a delineating point between thing a and thing B that means there is not one there is you don't need to be able to

(3:57:17) point out what it is you can clearly see that a kidney is different than blood we both know this the procedure for kidney

(3:57:22) is different than blood I think it's totally acceptable even if you can't identify whatever the exact threshold is

(3:57:28) maybe doctors can't I don't know um that I can't say that there's not then wouldn't we just be then we wouldn't the

(3:57:35) threshold just be arbitrary well wouldn't that be the case with the puddle in the ocean I I agree yeah but then why would

(3:57:41) you sa the one in the puddle but not the ocean because of G of of threshold well then what's the problem here we're both

(3:57:46) saying the same thing yeah so do you think that um giving kidney is less invasive than

(3:57:53) pregnancy yes G oh wait giving the kidney is less invasive no I think it's more invasive really yeah than pregnancy

(3:58:01) yeah you stuck stuck with that your whole life pregnancy you have for a few months nine months well I mean obviously

(3:58:06) depending on the health outcomes of your pregnancy you can have health issues for the rest of your life yes true and I would say the risk is greater no it's

(3:58:13) not greater for most women than giving the kidney would be no it's not I I disagree based on what based on health

(3:58:20) outcomes okay well how many okay based you think that people who give a kidney

(3:58:25) right are more or less likely to die than the average woman who has a pregnancy really I mean we're not even

(3:58:30) talking about death we can talk about health outcomes yeah Health outcomes are way worse people have one kidney can't drink ever again you have to be super

(3:58:37) careful you have to take enzymes you have to take uh various things that make sure that the kidney is compatible with

(3:58:43) your body and you have to take that stuff for years like no the health outcomes for people who give a kidney

(3:58:48) way worse than the average woman who's pregnant for sure like I wouldn't even put them in the same universe I I think

(3:58:54) the complexities of pregnancy it's not a fair assessment to say cuz obviously every pregnancy is going to be going to

(3:59:00) be different and then obviously like the health of the mother is going to be different as well which can add core

(3:59:07) morbidities yeah that's same thing with kidneys same thing but except that

(3:59:14) kidneys again yeah you're going to have to take I I just think the line would be drawn in terms of Parental obligation is

(3:59:20) you you don't have to use your body as life support yeah I get it uh I'm willing I'm

(3:59:27) actually willing to move to the next topic for the sake of time only because of this okay um I was willing to engage

(3:59:32) in this right but your position basically was just a bait position it's not a bait position it is a bait

(3:59:37) position okay fine well you believe it's murder to kill a person 7 months uh yes

(3:59:43) you just don't care about enfor ing that well I just don't see the the necessity in it of enforcing it no the necessity

(3:59:51) of a lethal termination yeah I know but if a doctor did lethally terminate a fetus at 7 months and there is no law

(3:59:57) governing it he didn't do anything wrong right I think he did something wrong but there's I I still would be opposed law

(4:00:04) cause more harm so you're just opposed to murdering babies like that's the you're opposed to

(4:00:10) legislating against murdering babies um I mean not within I I'm opposed to

(4:00:19) legislation that would cause uh a lot more death of of pregnant people yeah

(4:00:25) right so but you're you're opposed legislation of murdering babies my my position would be um that it's

(4:00:32) essentially a harm reduction got it so I just want to make sure though you don't want any legislation in regards to

(4:00:39) doctors who kill babies correct okay correct you wanted to move it on yeah by the way

(4:00:47) we did hit our 50 of 50 goal so yep so

(4:02:58) once the pizza comes we'll we'll drop the we'll do a TTS portion and then if

(4:03:04) there's anything else to get to for the debate we'll do that um Andrew what did you want to get into for what are the

(4:03:10) other topics well there was the gender wage Gap but it sounded like there's specifically other things that yeah what

(4:03:15) are the other ones sure there's uh gender wage Gap and anti- Purity

(4:03:23) culture yeah we'll probably actually agree on the anti- Purity culture really

(4:03:28) yeah your anti- Purity culture well depends on how it's defined how would you define

(4:03:34) it um prescribing virginity and uh less

() 

(4:03:40) sexual essentially sexual encounters before marriage as uh pure and virtuous

(4:03:47) oh well then no we would disagree how do you define it uh so for me Purity culture would be like absurd things like

(4:03:53) um you have to wear a burka right um like yeah I mean definitely prescriptions towards Purity I mean but

(4:04:00) that's really circular yeah well it's a circular position unless unless you have

(4:04:05) specificity right so we'll start with this idea of why do you think prescribing virginity is bad well I

(4:04:12) don't think virginity is is real what do you

(4:04:18) mean um I I just don't think it's it's something that you can quantify yeah no dicks in your vagina

(4:04:26) it's Quantified as virgin if I um if I just have sex with women I'm a

(4:04:32) virgin uh no why well so there's no dicks yeah yeah so um you would still be

(4:04:40) a virgin to a man right at least from that perspective from my perspective I

(4:04:45) would you define virginity as no dicks yeah yeah I was being factious obviously said no dick in your vagg not a virgin

(4:04:52) yeah if you have sex with somebody you're not a virgin what is sex it would be the art

(4:04:58) of intercourse I don't think women can really have sex with each other it's just mutual

(4:05:04) masturbation that's it so are we just defining sex as penetration yeah yeah so

(4:05:10) I or [ __ ] I think [ __ ] Doo really [ __ ] count mhm as a form of like sodomite sex so if I

(4:05:18) give a [ __ ] am I virgin well your mouth's not a virgin I'm just I mean this seems really

(4:05:25) inconsistent I'm just yeah so when we're talking about virginity I don't think um

(4:05:31) that there's anything that's really confusing so women can masturbate each other men can masturbate with women

(4:05:37) right but we're talking about virginity itself and by the way all of those things are bad right all of them are bad

(4:05:43) so if you gave with that yeah okay well so I'm just talking about purity culture would say all those things are bad uh

(4:05:49) right so when you but when you're talking about virginity it's like yeah it's pretty simple like no dick no D in the v and you maintain The

(4:05:57) Virginity um is this like a a medical or like a a body standard or so this is

(4:06:04) just an experience thing yeah how far does it have to go in I mean if the if it goes in at all so

(4:06:12) just the tip yeah you're not a virgin anymore so the reason that I think this is it gets touched it gets touched it's

(4:06:19) over so my vulva touches no I'm talking it's penetrative sex yes it's

(4:06:24) penetrative sex so the reason that I think that this concept is just um not

(4:06:30) like a functional definition is because sexual experience is very complex and I

(4:06:35) think it's absolutely silly to say that me having just sex with women and being

(4:06:41) a lesbian somehow puts me in a condition that's any less that's any less than if

(4:06:47) I were to have sex with a man why is that silly because like what what is the delineation here ifting if she if they

(4:06:55) like is there a penis is there a penis involved I mean if there's a dildo does that count like if then like I use a

(4:07:02) dildo on myself does I count she holding it that would be called what masturbation right so I'm wondering like

(4:07:08) what what are we measuring here we're measuring your Purity when it comes to how many dicks you've had in your

(4:07:15) vagina like human dicks yes why because that's the metric for virginity yeah so

(4:07:23) I I just think it's um obviously again I I don't think it's a good working definition because it reduces sexual

(4:07:30) experience down to not only a heteronormative narrative um but also that sexual

(4:07:38) experience can be done in a multitude of ways to to where I would say that what

(4:07:46) meaningful difference is it that you're Crossing this threshold that there's a male penis inside your vagina what does

(4:07:52) that do it removes your virginity what that's circular like you're not

(4:07:59) virginity is just having a penis inside you removing your virginity like what okay I'm sorry what are why let me make

(4:08:04) sure I get this right can you have sex without a person uh no well you can you can M you

(4:08:12) can wait a second wait a second you can't have sex without another person

(4:08:18) there counting masturbation what counts as sex with another person then kissing

(4:08:23) um I would say I mean again when we talk about intercourse I think it's really hard to have like these kissing sex no

(4:08:31) what's not sex about it I would say oral um oral vaginal what's not sex about that stuff this seems like you have the

(4:08:37) inconsistent you have the inconsistent position why isn't kissing sex um

(4:08:44) why isn't kissing intercourse because I would say intercourse well what's the difference between sex and intercourse well

(4:08:50) intercourse I think something enters right okay yeah so like if if you're you can have lesbian sex nothing enters

(4:08:57) right well you can have something enter too is lesbian sex sex yeah okay so then

(4:09:02) there's a difference between sex and intercourse sure okay so then I I use those interchange I'm fine with that

(4:09:07) delineation so then why isn't kissing sex um I I would say the use of uh

(4:09:14) essentially the inclusion of genitals would be would be sex what

(4:09:21) why um because like you can like kiss your mom and I wouldn't say that that's

(4:09:26) like so if you lick a guy's balls did you have sex with them just once I think that's definitely a sexual experience

(4:09:32) did you have sex with them though um yes I did oh okay so licking balls is

(4:09:38) licking balls is is doing the de sex yep okay gotcha what about licking his feet

(4:09:44) oh no gross how come that's not sex um I think that can be a sexual act for sure

(4:09:49) just like licking the balls yeah so so it sounds like you have an arbitrary metric and mine's way more specific I

(4:09:56) think uh when you and I are talking about sexual experience I think you're proving my point it that sexual experience can be very Vari uh variety

(4:10:03) and Nuance so the idea though of intercourse thing enters right we're

(4:10:09) talking about virginity right so I think I think that there's men too inside of

(4:10:14) the kind of religious vocal who would say that if you gave a [ __ ] you're not a virgin I'm fine with that too yeah

(4:10:20) and I think that um and and that's kind of one of the issues that I have with it is to you know I think one of the most

(4:10:26) common questions that uh teenagers ask like I've done X am I still a virgin and

(4:10:31) it's because you have this notion that when you do a specific sex act somehow you're a different person than the

(4:10:38) person you were prior to the sex act yeah something definitely changed what you had sex well what I'm I'm talking

(4:10:46) about like character or who you are as a person because um and this is where I

(4:10:51) think L that's not why but but that's not why people select based on virginity I I think this is a

(4:10:58) prescription of Purity culture is that somehow you are tainted you are less than you are impure um that your

(4:11:06) character that your value as a person has lessened because you've had this experience I think it's just based

(4:11:11) around preference so I just think that idea is very simple I'm saying that's what Purity culture implies that if

(4:11:17) you've had sex you're less pure yeah I think that based this is

() 

(4:11:22) based around the preference that men have of women having less sexual partners I think it's not an innate

(4:11:28) preference it's a societal one no it's a Nate and I'll demonstrate why it's an Nate do you want me I can demonstrate it

(4:11:36) so do you agree with me that uh paternity tests were not always a thing in fact they're very recent yes so so

(4:11:43) how to miniature paternity before there was paternity tests well someone not being

(4:11:49) polyamorous so only having sex with them well you can not be a virgin and still

(4:11:55) be monogamous sure but one way that you can assure that your Offspring is going to be yours is to only be the only

(4:12:01) person that woman's ever slept with how do you determine that well they used to have himman Checkers things like this that's not a effective determinant of

(4:12:08) virginity you can lose you can lose your hman writing your back that's true but

(4:12:13) it is a pretty effective metric I considering techn yes considering

(4:12:19) technology it is it's not tests are very ineffective when there's no other test

(4:12:25) what other test is there that's my point there is no test yeah right so then yeah so and not a good L calm down if it is

(4:12:33) the case if it is the case though that that's what's there right and the only way that you can determine whether or

(4:12:40) not a child is yours if the woman is sleeping with you of course it would follow that you would be revolted by

(4:12:45) women who slept with a lot of men but you can't determine that if the highman is there or not why would that listen

(4:12:52) first of all yes that's a good indication they're not a virgent the heyman's not there um no like I said you can you can

(4:13:00) uh lose your you know your Hyman can break like horseback riding sure but it's not common falling on a fence it is

(4:13:07) common no it's much more common that the highman breaks how how do most hman get broke I have no idea with a dick how do

(4:13:13) you measure that are you we can look at do you want me to look it up right now sure yeah I would love

(4:13:25) something just put most common way Heyman

(4:13:38) braks what'd you get uh the most common ways sexual

(4:13:43) intercourse followed by tampons okay which makes sense to me how

(4:13:50) tell me the methodology um people research has been done shows there's no scientific way to tell from the

(4:13:56) inspection of your Heyman whether you did or did not have intercourse that was not what was said what was said is that

(4:14:01) the most common way Ayman gets broken is with a pen again it says that based on a

(4:14:07) lot of research shows there's no scientific way to tell from the inspection of your hman

(4:14:14) whether you did or did not have intercourse and that is your position right no okay what's the most common way

(4:14:20) for himman to break again are you saying that the Hyman is a scientific way to

(4:14:26) tell if you've had sex or not only if there's no other scientific way available it would be the only scientific way it's not a scientific ma

(4:14:34) like um method and and there is no other way that's that's yes it is a scientific

(4:14:40) method whether you think it's good or not it's not a scientific method yes it would be a scientific method okay so

(4:14:47) tell me this how would you make a determination right if the only thing available to you was to check a Heyman

(4:14:54) that was the only thing that was available to you again it's not a good criteria a man right that's the only way

(4:15:01) to check for Chastity or virginity and women were told and trained not to break their Heyman to say how you trained Not

(4:15:08) To Break by doing activities that would break them that is just absolutely ridiculous but happened I I I don't care

(4:15:15) if it happened it's not it's not an effective way to ter to determine if someone is I think that if there's no

(4:15:22) other way around it's the most effective way it doesn't mean it's effective though it's just the most effective

(4:15:28) which is mean it's effective though just the most effective though we're say we agree yeah so great so then it's the

(4:15:34) most effective way so if it's not if it's the most effective way but when there's no other way and um the reason

(4:15:42) that it's not effective is because there is no medical condition of virginity

(4:15:48) nobody's saying it's a medical condition or physical condition even well I would

(4:15:54) argue that there's no physical assessment that you can do to determine if someone is I think I think virginity

(4:16:00) is conceptual sure yeah but I think that you can still have signs for a concept

(4:16:06) like I think again it it's not effective like obviously the highman can be absent

(4:16:11) and someone be a virgin and can be and I'm not disputing that okay great yeah but that was never in dispute what

(4:16:18) what's in dispute is how you could tell about hang on hang on about why it is that a man would want to select for

(4:16:24) women who have low body counts and the reason they'd want to select for them is because well now we're going into body

(4:16:29) count which is different than virginity no it's not yes it absolutely is no you can't have bodies and be a

(4:16:35) virgin well body count is different than virginity like count is just a running

(4:16:41) count where like virginity but there's a way to determine zero count would be a virgin that's what we mean by virginity

(4:16:47) zero body again like this is where I just think it's ineffective because sexual experience is an important thing

(4:16:53) when analyzing I don't um when it when it comes to men wanting to let me just figure this out quick when it one second

(4:17:00) when when it comes to men having this preference um of guaranteed paternity I

(4:17:07) don't think that this is an innate preference why uh because of

(4:17:13) essentially how um different mating strategies worked in different tribes okay how did they work uh there were

(4:17:22) poly obviously polyamorous I mean even in Rome in more modern day patriarchy

(4:17:27) patriarchy like they had like wedding orgies mhm yeah yeah so I think it was

(4:17:34) just in terms of uh making sure that you know children were born so that the um

(4:17:42) you know community could survive well let's let's test this out I just want to ask you a quick question okay if your son came to you

() 

(4:17:50) mhm and said Mom I have this woman who's only been with one man and I have

(4:17:56) another woman who's been with 250 men okay I'm trying to figure out which one I want to be with for the long term

(4:18:03) right which one would you tell him you would think would be the most

(4:18:09) monogamous um I don't think you can determine monogamy based on body count

(4:18:14) well that's not what I asked you I I wouldn't have an answer so if if one had only now what if one had never slept

(4:18:20) with anybody and the other one would s with 200 which one which one wouldn't have an answer you wouldn't have an

(4:18:26) answer yeah I mean um even even if I look at my own relationship um whatever

(4:18:31) you consider to be a body count mine was higher than my ex's and he's the one that cheated so I don't think that that

(4:18:38) determines your faithfulness your monogamy I think that there are women

(4:18:43) who've had sex with hundreds of men who could be monogamous to one man whereas a virgin could cheat on him sure I totally

(4:18:50) I totally ConEd that there's outliers to everything we're just talking about likelihoods I don't think that I I I

(4:18:56) mean I could even argue that because you have less sexual experience you would be more inclined to stray if you become

(4:19:02) bored the relationship becomes stale I don't think that that is the ultimate reason why people cheat do you trust Pew

(4:19:10) research um I think Pew research is a good source yeah so according to P research women who get married as

(4:19:16) virgins are far less likely to cheat than women who don't yeah I think there's a correlation versus to well

(4:19:21) actually it gets higher by everyone the metric gets higher one is this the same study when it comes to um I I'm sorry is

(4:19:30) this cheating it's not a study these aren't studies so were these surveys yeah and

(4:19:37) so I'm sorry explain yeah yeah so it's just that the the corlet there seems to

(4:19:43) be that virgins cheat way less right I I think obviously we can and I don't um

(4:19:50) like obviously correlation is not causation and so when we talk about causation all causation are

(4:19:55) correlates sure but again you would need to establish uh causation I could say that women who have like what you would

(4:20:02) deem lower body counts um would more than likely be religious I won't even

(4:20:07) dispute this so if we if you and I agree that correlation is not causation but all causation is correlation then we're

(4:20:13) just looking for strong correlat and that's what we're going to make determine cause well but cause is I

(4:20:21) think aren't all causes correlates uh one second I I think it's really silly

(4:20:26) to say that relationships fail or people cheat because of necessarily their past

(4:20:32) experience I'm not even saying that okay so what what is your I'm explaining I'm

(4:20:37) explaining it to you so if it is the case that we're just looking for strong corelates this seems to be a really strong correlate okay that if you're

(4:20:44) Virgin uh you're going to cheat way less now you can make the claim well have we determined that that's the cause well I

(4:20:51) think I think even if you haven't let's just say that there's some other correlations there like I don't know maybe virgins like um they don't cheat

(4:20:59) for some other reason than they haven't been with a bunch of guys like uh they're just virgins are more likely to

(4:21:05) be brunettes let's just say they're more like in to what be like Bernett I don't know I can't think of yeah I think I

(4:21:11) think Bernett ch yeah I can't think what the correlate would be that would be more strong than less sexual experience

(4:21:18) leads to less cheating if virgins are cheating way less I can think of a single but you are technically correct

(4:21:25) that correlation is not causation we need to establish causation but from a reasoning standpoint if you're a man

(4:21:31) right can you tell me the uh reasoning standpoint I'll link it to you actually but from a um Mr re send me over that

(4:21:39) study or the PE research data so anyway you just tell me the title yeah I can't remember the top of my head but I'll

(4:21:44) give it to you right I've brought it up in debates and sourced it multiple times I'll get it to you no no I'm but anyway

(4:21:49) so on the idea yeah on the idea of virgins let's just assume for a second

(4:21:55) right that we don't have a causation it's just a really strong coret me as a rational man why wouldn't I take that

(4:22:01) into consideration when doing mate selection um like I don't want to get divorced

(4:22:07) right I mean if you do want to enter into marriage I think that's the obvious goal sure so then it seems like anything

(4:22:15) that would reduce me getting a divorce like having a woman who's much more religious that's going to reduce the chance of divorce it's also going to

(4:22:22) demonstrate to me that I think there can be other goals though like also going to demonstrate to me if she's not having sex that would you rather be unhappily

(4:22:30) married or Happily Divorced um well from from my religious

(4:22:36) standpoint well from my preference or my religious standpoint either yeah from my preference I'd rather be happily

(4:22:41) divorced but I still think you have obligation to married even if you're unhappy because

(4:22:49) unhappiness in marriage can be short term even if it's only a couple of years so I still think there's an obligation especially for kids to stay together so

(4:22:55) anyway I mean I don't necessarily disagree yeah so that aside we'll leave that for a second if I look for

(4:23:00) correlates of things right that strongly correlate that are going to reduce the

(4:23:05) chances of divorce for me in this case a woman cheating is going to greatly increase the chances we get divorced

(4:23:11) that's just true why because if you cheat on me I'm going to divorce you so but you just said you

(4:23:18) have a duty yes but there's threshold breakers for the duty okay why is that a threshold breaker because uh this would

(4:23:26) violate the very thing which kept me in the marriage to begin with which is the religious obligation towards it I see um

(4:23:32) would the degree of what what are we counting as cheating is that intercourse no okay if you just like even the I have

(4:23:40) an emotional connection with X for me would be cheating oh really so if your

(4:23:46) wife said I have emotional feelings for this guy um even if she didn't want them

(4:23:51) but she just still felt it well that's different if well it depends on the severity like um I'm in love with Chad I

(4:23:59) don't want to be in love with Chad but I am that's it you're done that's

(4:24:04) over so go be in love with Chad when we're not married I I'm sorry so if your

(4:24:11) wife developed emotional feelings for someone but didn't act on them yeah that's still done yeah okay yeah so I

(4:24:17) would consider you think you have control over that I think I think I have control um

(4:24:23) sorry do you think someone has control over that of developing emotional feelings for someone else sure you have

(4:24:28) tons of control for instance you can put yourself in positions where you don't engage with men who aren't your husband and then you can't develop those

(4:24:34) feelings very simple wow Am I Wrong um I

(4:24:40) mean you could never talk to anyone ever you can talk to people well I mean

(4:24:45) people you don't just meet a person and go oh my God I'm in love that doesn't I think things happen over over an

(4:24:51) elongated period of time yeah so I think yeah you have tons of control over that so but that aside back to the the idea

(4:24:59) of virginity if if it is true that virgins cheat less and that seems to be what the Pew research poll says and if

(4:25:06) you have less than nine right it continuously decreases and then I don't remember what the number was before it

(4:25:13) basically flat I feel like you're talking about the Institute of family studies which actually said that women

(4:25:18) with two to nine uh I believe two to n Partners had less divorce rates than women with zero to well no that was two

(4:25:24) to that was 2 to four I think believe it was 2 to n no CU decided that several times think it was 2 to four but we can

(4:25:30) check yeah I'll have Brian pull it up when he gets back still it is the higher uh 2 to9 and virgins and yeah but if I

(4:25:38) want toow like low body but let's just grant it let's just even Grant the the research for family studies and we'll

(4:25:45) just say like the 2 to9 right have a less divorce rate than even the Virgin right um fine like so if I obviously not

(4:25:53) a Cause right yeah if I wasn't revolted well there could be other contributing

(4:25:58) correlates or confounding factors but the thing is is that if I'm not revolted so you agree with me that relationships

() 

(4:26:04) revolve around attraction um I guess it depends on what you mean by attraction can you have sex

(4:26:10) with men you're not attracted to can't know yeah right so neither can most people they don't want to have sex with people they're not attracted to so if

(4:26:17) you're a person are we just talking about physical attraction yeah okay yeah so if you're not physically attracted to

(4:26:23) a woman because she's not a virin I mean I think that's change like um there have been men that I haven't been like

(4:26:29) physically attracted to and then I get to know them and they become attractive so then you become attracted to them right but I just want to say it's like

(4:26:35) not necessarily based on a physical basis but because of who they are as a person but you are attracted to them

(4:26:40) physically or you wouldn't sleep with them right yeah okay great or emotionally if you will okay whatever it is but so for men physical attraction

(4:26:47) and they don't want to sleep with women that they don't find physically attractive if they find this to be revolting to them right that there have

(4:26:54) been with other men they find they they can't maintain some type of attracted

(4:26:59) level to the other person um then what's wrong with them selecting for a

(4:27:05) virgin um I would wonder why this is a criteria cuz the only because you're not

(4:27:10) attracted to you if you're not a virgin well but like why is that equality I think when

(4:27:17) we talk about like attractiveness um sure I think there can be um metrics that don't necessarily

(4:27:25) have reason like for some reason I like brunettes more than blonds I don't know why um but when it comes to specific

(4:27:33) behaviors um I I think that's more of like a philosophical stance than just

(4:27:38) like this innate you know I'm attracted to you because of X degree I

(4:27:44) mean you think you can help you think you can help what you find attractive what if I don't disclose though and then

(4:27:51) you do yeah so I'm not attracted anymore well let's just say hypothetically that

(4:27:56) um you know a beautiful man's attracted to me and like everything is there the the personality the compatibility you

(4:28:03) know is is he really not attracted to me yeah what if he disclosed to you that he molested children would you still be

(4:28:08) attracted to him um I think there would still obious viously be some feelings for that person

(4:28:14) like I would you still be attracted to I wouldn't stay with him would you still be attracted to him or do you think you could decrease that would decrease the

(4:28:19) attraction level I mean I would definitely be repulsed yeah that's my whole point but I don't think that so then all that matters is is that even if

(4:28:26) it's revealed to you later and now you you so basically I guess there would be like efficacy or

(4:28:33) um some form of validity CU I think like women engaging in consensual relationships is very different than

(4:28:40) someone who is engaging um like graping children but that's not in dispute it's

(4:28:46) just if this piece of information pertinent information was revealed to you that was not before could that

(4:28:52) deviate your attraction but what's reasonable I guess is what I'm asking I think it's totally reasonable if somebody releases to you that they have

(4:28:58) slept with 50 men that you could be repulsed by that why is that not reasonable why why why would it be

(4:29:04) reasonable because you don't want to Envision men having sex with your woman so so it is a property thing then well

(4:29:10) it's not just a property owners revulsion thing I don't know that just seems kind of insecure oh well then it's

(4:29:15) kind of insecure that you want data guy based on his past relationship molesting children I don't think that's insecurity at all like that why inse him like him

(4:29:24) molesting children um is obviously a heinous act but he's reformed now he's

(4:29:29) not doing it anymore is obviously a heinous act where like someone else engaging in a consensual relationship is

(4:29:35) not why would I have an issue that they've had a past partner because all that really matters is what devh your

(4:29:42) attractiveness so for you it deviates the attractiveness for this person because they did X activity is the same

(4:29:49) thing here no I I don't think that that is a um Fair equivalence well the it's 100% a

(4:29:56) fair equivalence we're just talking about your attractiveness to ex person and without attractiveness there can be

(4:30:04) no sex there's no relationship I think we we have to talk about like essentially what

(4:30:10) um when we look at like societal qualifiers I think like there are obviously uh reasonable expectations

(4:30:17) when it comes to a partner I I just don't know why someone would be repulsed by consensual sex acts previously I

(4:30:25) don't understand why I feel like you're just kind of saying like men are conditioned into patriarchy to Value

(4:30:31) virginity because they view women AR like you're not making an argument right now can men not be attracted to women

(4:30:38) based on the fact that they have a higher body count and if the answer is yes and attraction hang on and

(4:30:44) attraction requires is required for there to be sex in a relationship to begin with then I need an argument for

(4:30:51) why it is men can't be attracted to only virgins I need to know that what is the argument against that what you are you

(4:30:57) attracted to an experience you're attracted to the fact that they've had less men they've slept with that's an

(4:31:03) attractive quality to you how is that attractive because it is it's attracted to you I don't think it is because it is

(4:31:09) you think you can help attraction um I I think that attraction can come from aspects of social conditioning sure

(4:31:17) so you could personally help right now who you're attracted to um I mean in some capacity I think

(4:31:24) there are uh levels of conditioning when it comes to society that tell us like

(4:31:29) what are okay criteria and what are not okay so can gay men do that what do you mean can they determine that they're not

(4:31:35) attracted to men uh I mean that's different now we're talking about it's different yeah now

(4:31:41) we're talking about like sexual identity versus like no that's we're talking

(4:31:46) about what we're talking about that we find attractive do you think gay men can

(4:31:52) suddenly just will themselves to not be attracted to other gay men of course not but oh okay then how come sex sexual

(4:31:59) identity is very different than what we would consider preferences do you think if I like find brunettes attractive that

(4:32:06) like I don't find blondes attractive well wait a second I I'm I'm super

(4:32:11) confused I also don't think that you could only find blondes attractive and not find brunettes attractive so you can

(4:32:18) definitely only find blond attrative so I think that when we talk about social

(4:32:24) prescriptions to say that men have this social prescription to want virgins to

(4:32:31) me is just no that's I didn't say anything about social prescription for for men to have this philosophy or

(4:32:37) preference of wanting virgins to be um again is just essentially like

() 

(4:32:43) misogynistic conditioning yeah that's an assertion right you're not actually making an argument so I need an argument

(4:32:50) for why it is that men couldn't be attracted to women who have not slept with any other men and that's the

(4:32:57) preference for attractiveness I mean it it's information that only the

(4:33:03) person can give you that's right so if I say I am a virgin and that's a not fact true

(4:33:12) then yeah but now we're back to the same issue with the guy who reveals that he didd kids if he tells you he didn't didd

(4:33:19) kids you find him amazing the second he reveals to you that he did you find that way less attractive guess I guess we

(4:33:25) like I feel like the false comparison here is like you're comparing an immoral act to a non- immoral man well that's a

(4:33:30) matter of perspective I could say that from my perspective or the Christian Perspective it's an immoral act to have sex outside of marriage so the less you

(4:33:37) do that immoral act the more attractive I find you um yeah I so this is just a

(4:33:43) perspective when you're talking about the the moral aspect and by by the way because I mean I I think consent being a

(4:33:50) main basis um would would be a really good foundation when determining like um

(4:33:57) evaluating attractiveness based on sexual history wait say that I'm sorry when

(4:34:10) we when we're talking about sexual history um I just don't know why

(4:34:16) consensual Mutual acts um can be like that that's not

(4:34:21) immoral engaging with someone consensually is not an immoral action from your

(4:34:27) view but from the view of the Christian it is so if you were a Christian and your

(4:34:33) preference was to have a Christian woman right but why does Christianity prescribe that

(4:34:40) what whoes we're just talking about your I do think well I mean obviously that's a that matter when it comes to your

(4:34:47) preference for attractiveness because obviously it's a patriarchal prescription in order to maintain like

(4:34:53) male Supremacy so so is it with the Christian purview is it equal well I

(4:34:58) think that that religion is the only thing which can account for things like Purity good bad they the only thing is

(4:35:06) give accounts for those things anyway so I I disagree with them okay well then uh

(4:35:12) let's take something that's super simple if you disagree with that Justice account for Justice from a

(4:35:18) secular worldview like it's just as well so it's just as just for me if somebody

(4:35:23) uh were to murder my daughter for me to murder theirs that's just as just why isn't it you did wrong to me I

(4:35:30) did wrong back to you right you got exactly what you deserve back that seems very just and yet we don't do that again

(4:35:37) I think just isn't necessarily like what what is right in terms of punishment because

(4:35:44) like obviously you um killing the person's daughter doesn't bring your daughter back so what does that have to

(4:35:50) do with Justice if the idea is I think that would be the justice is where your daughter was never killed yeah but so

(4:35:56) you're accounting for it just through preference so that's fine you can account no I'm just saying that um

(4:36:03) Justice and kind of like retribution um or

(4:36:08) punishment is just not the the word justice if I remember correctly is to

(4:36:14) set to right that is the idea of Justice to set to right okay or to bring order

(4:36:20) something like this now don't quote me on that I could be wrong about it but I think that that's the emology is like just setting it right you could you can

(4:36:27) literally make that anything you want to be just right anything again if someone's punished I don't think that's

(4:36:33) like to set to right punishing somebody correct so

(4:36:38) jails bad um I mean I don't think that that's um necessarily like justice in

(4:36:46) itself especially within our system we we don't give like victims any access Yeah in our system into health so

(4:36:53) Justice is just perspective it can't be accounted for outside of your preference so the thing is is like since well I

(4:36:58) would say justice would either be preventing the action from occurring in the future stopping me uh this is me

(4:37:05) saying again okay no you you're saying yes I'm defining the concept correct

(4:37:11) yeah from your from whose perspective though um from mine so it's accounted for by your preference my preference for

(4:37:18) what whatever justices okay right you're accounting for it through

(4:37:23) your preference right um sure like I guess understanding of concept but um I

(4:37:29) think we can obviously see that like within harm reduction harm reduction itself counting

(4:37:35) for through your preference again you you want harm reduced like my preference could be that I want harm maximized you

(4:37:42) can't account for why mine is bad and yours is good other than because you want harm reduced it's all accounted for through your preference well I think

(4:37:48) harm red like when we look at harm and suffering like that is a physiological experience that um our bodies do have

(4:37:56) negative outcomes for and if we're both going to agree that our subjective experience is essentially what what our

(4:38:04) life is then um the thing of life that we have value would need to be of of the

(4:38:10) best quality to where we have experiences um that are

(4:38:17) desired yeah but you can have experiences that are desired that you would still be against even if they

(4:38:23) cause no harm because you don't have a consistent principle like here I'll give you great example two brothers want to

(4:38:28) have sex with each other and they're consenting adults this is wrong due to

(4:38:35) what um if there's no power Dynamic I mean I I don't have a claim against incest

(4:38:42) really yeah oh other than it's just icky but no it's just a yucky what about

(4:38:48) necrophilia so necrophilia I do think um is obviously what we talked about like a

(4:38:54) paraphilic which I would say in terms of someone's sexual uh

() 

(4:39:01) psychology um is is harmful to them in itself because it has the criteria that

(4:39:07) you're um engaging with someone who's unconscious you know engaging with someone at all well right but a an

(4:39:15) entity that is unconscious if you want you're not engaging with an entity at all you're not engaging with anything

(4:39:20) right from your view there's no soul right right so then what are you

(4:39:26) engaging with with a dead body I mean obviously you're you're

(4:39:32) having like there there is still um remnants of a person there even though personhood isn't present there's no

(4:39:37) person there personhood isn't present correct but there's nothing there it's just nothing right just just flesh I

(4:39:46) know but just again it's similar to someone if they were unconscious right

(4:39:52) no unconscious you agree that's still a person dead you agree it's not a person

(4:39:57) correct so then no it's not the same but I mean in terms of the the experience that you have as the as

(4:40:03) salent not the experience but if you're experience is that you [ __ ] love this and it's great I think that's even if

(4:40:10) there is pleasure me from it it still is harmful for you prove it what's the harm prove it how do you how do you

(4:40:17) demonstrate that's harmful the person tells you it's not harming me um again when when like the psychology it's kind

(4:40:23) of similar like people always say like serial killers are really happy like uning and murdering people um but I do

(4:40:29) think there is harm because kind of the concept of like harm is done to you harm

(4:40:35) is done to me [ __ ] I'm dude that's it's it's over for you Brian I think there are are

(4:40:42) psychological profiles of someone's sexual identity that even if they like it is still harmful to them it is

(4:40:48) detrimental yeah but you can't prove that you just like it's just made up right so a person says if a person's

(4:40:54) telling you I'm not harmed by this and I absolutely adore it right you can't demonstrate that they're harmed by it I

(4:41:00) mean there are specific ways I think you can through like I mean you can't like

(4:41:06) test for it sure as it's happening because of certain brain chemical reac is not being monitored but I think uh

(4:41:13) thank you I think you would agree like to someone um who is like cutting themselves even though they're happy

(4:41:20) about it and they love it they're still harming themselves by your

(4:41:25) definition um actually I'll just grant it and by your definition sure we can

(4:41:31) literally see that there's cuts on the arm so I'm saying that what is going on how brain you can't see so then how do

(4:41:37) you know it's true that it's actually harming them um you don't right like you don't

(4:41:44) actually know that I I do cuz I think we can measure again like when we see

(4:41:50) aspects of suffering how that changes your brain and uh how trauma changes your brain these are physiological

(4:41:56) occurrences that change your brain which which are harmful and negative you can't demonstrate that a person who tells you

(4:42:03) they're happy as can be banging a dead body I mean I can't like see bra you're

(4:42:08) right we can see that people who suffer or have severe trauma have different um

(4:42:14) brain structures and they're not suffering and have no trauma they love doing this it's their favorite maybe if

(4:42:20) they're not conscious of it sure no they're conscious of it they just really like it um again I I think you can see

(4:42:27) differences in brain structures when it comes to certain psychological outcomes even if the conscious is saying this is

(4:42:33) enjoyable so are you saying that there's not a single human being on planet Earth who's a man who's had sex with a dead

(4:42:39) body and Contin ously does this who doesn't just do it because they enjoy

(4:42:46) it um who does it like that that's not my claim though then what's the harm to

(4:42:52) him from hisp tell there are brain like it changes certain brain structures that

(4:42:58) are harmful to him even if he's not aware of it which ones I I don't know on that one yeah CU they it depend it

(4:43:04) depend can't you can't look at the brain that way and be like oh you've [ __ ] 20

(4:43:09) dead bodies and this this thing is Ted that'ss sure sure like

(4:43:15) obviously I can't say like you know this brain this region of your brain is where you did necro the is where you did um

(4:43:23) like incest but so you're just doing the same thing right you're saying I think that it's harmful because I think it's

(4:43:29) harmful I can't really demonstrate it I just think it is anyway I I think like psychology and

(4:43:36) sure I I acknowledge like I'm not um you know like a neurologist like a

(4:43:43) brain um yes I do think there is uh certain things that we can see in the outcomes of like how the brain Mals and

(4:43:50) transforms and responds to its environment that would we could measure and that would happen with every single man who engaged in that

(4:43:56) activity yes okay so then would you say that this is the case with women who

(4:44:01) have many many sexual partners that their amount of trauma would increase um again I think it would

(4:44:07) depend um on the experience itself like obviously I think someone um who has

(4:44:15) been graped several times is going to have a different sexual experience um you know maybe having

(4:44:22) however many bodies you want to ass uh let's just say for the sake of the argument 10 bodies but every single one

(4:44:27) of them graped her there's going to be a different psychological profile than someone who has engaged in 10 consensual

(4:44:34) relationships I see do you think that a person who has engaged in multiple relationships going to have more baggage

() 

(4:44:40) than a person who hasn't I think it depends just generally on average I I see it's hard to to give

(4:44:47) that generalization because I think it depends on the quality of the relationship okay or the experience of

(4:44:52) the relationship do I think if someone might have had like two or three really toxic romantic relationships they might

(4:44:58) have more baggage than someone who might have like four or five one night stands because they don't have but all of them

(4:45:05) are going to have more baggage than a person who had no relationships um who's had no relationships or no sex no

(4:45:12) relationships um I mean I don't know I think incels have a lot of baggage and a lot of them are virgins no no no not

(4:45:18) relationship based baggage uh what what do you mean by that like for instance if if you're in a

(4:45:25) relationship with a man for I don't know 5 years or something like this and it ends in complete like it's just a

(4:45:32) [ __ ] disaster right it's going to create trauma for you right yeah okay I would prefer not to deal with that

(4:45:38) trauma and I I would say that women who experienced that trauma would not

(4:45:44) experience that trauma if they weren't in that relationship so the idea here is same thing with sex right is that the

(4:45:49) more sexual partners you have the more chance for trauma so I think it depends

(4:45:55) kind of again on a lot of multitud different things like um I mean here

(4:46:02) I'll give you an example I would say I had more Trauma from uh the disillusion of my marriage than I did from um all

(4:46:09) other casual relationships combined yeah that makes sense to me totally so being with a divorce would that would be

(4:46:16) trauma right that they would have more baggage just on average than someone who wasn't a

(4:46:22) divorce I would have like a divorce bag yeah probably has more baggage and someone who's not been divorced um I

(4:46:29) mean sure I can grant that more likely so then so now we're starting to whittle down sexual selection so if we're just

(4:46:35) talking about trauma or we talking about things like this I would say that for instance is it okay for a man to have a

(4:46:40) reference not to have been not to be with a woman who was graped because she doesn't want to deal

(4:46:46) with her baggage um I wouldn't necessarily place

(4:46:51) the preference on being graped but essentially like their emotional state and kind of where they are within their

(4:46:57) capacity um yeah yeah it would just depend on

(4:47:03) again it's not the criteria of have they been graped or not um it's kind of where

(4:47:09) they are within you know that experience was it 10 years ago and they've really healed from that was it yesterday and

(4:47:16) you know they're having a nervous breakdown again that would just be context dependent yeah but that baggage

(4:47:21) exists due to the fact that there was a grave and you would agree with me that I mean I think that baggage can morph

(4:47:27) itself in different formats I agreed but in this case it came from that so in other words I guess I'm guess I just

(4:47:33) don't think you should make assumptions on that and eval may not but do you agree with me that grape is traumatizing

(4:47:38) for women yes I think it's traumatizing for anyone I guess not you do you think do you think that since it's

(4:47:44) traumatizing for women that men should probably look at it as a red flag if they don't want to deal with do you mean

(4:47:50) a red flag trauma they don't want to deal with a woman's trauma um I mean it can certainly be

(4:47:57) like a um I'm trying to think you know like a point like something you note but I think you should be

(4:48:03) evaluating um the person that you're with based on their behavior and your interaction with them not necessarily

(4:48:10) pred determined um facts and it all predetermined facts or

(4:48:15) just some I mean they're you're going to go back I'm sure to the child molest well I'm just I'm just pointing out like

(4:48:20) the consistency aspect here it seems like it's perfectly acceptable for uh

(4:48:25) men to have preferences where they say I rule you out because I just don't want to deal with this ever and I mean like

(4:48:32) sure I'm not going to like force someone to be like oh no but I mean it sounds

(4:48:37) legi what's like what's illegitimate about a man saying I want a virgin because I feel revolted when a woman's

(4:48:43) not one I think he needs to unpack why he feels revolted okay so he unpacks it

(4:48:49) and he discovers why but he still is well what's the what's the reason I don't know but whatever it is he still

(4:48:54) he knows what it is but he can't just shut it off like well maybe then he doesn't need to I mean

(4:49:00) so so what's wrong with that do you support like large age gaps sure is

(4:49:06) there any criteria not really no so you're fine with a 45-year-old dating an 18-year-old

(4:49:14) yeah okay um you know we can come back to the age we we can come back to the

(4:49:21) finish this like real quick we're right there Andrew the pineapple pizza I'm not eating it you Andrew I told you I wasn't

(4:49:28) going to eat it I'll literally throw up bro I can't do it there it's so gross to me it's like it's so

(4:49:36) gross will you eat a singular pineapple you won't even do you like you don't like pineapple dude it makes me sick

(4:49:42) literally like you won't eat pineapple on its own pineapple juice no nothing

(4:49:47) are you allergic to it no it just makes me like feel sick are you feeling a bit

(4:49:52) uncomfortable that it's even that close to you I care if it's close to like skin contact's okay yeah but ingesting

(4:49:58) pineapple is a no-o yeah don't you have like a food you really hate sure that's that for what is that well I have I have

(4:50:05) an actual allergy to something oh yeah well but what's the food you hate though uh

(4:50:13) [ __ ] that's a hard one uh horseradish oh delicious or

(4:50:19) sauerkraut that's okay I'm not a I don't like saour I hate sourkraut I don't like sour but that's all it's cuz cabbage

(4:50:25) gross yeah do you want to eat some of your pizza or are you I mean I'm fine

(4:50:31) but if I'm the only one who's going to be EA if you're forcing people to eat like I'm just eat I'm just alone here

(4:50:38) eating a pineapple good time eat a piece of pineapple pizza and I'll have a smoke we'll finish this

(4:50:43) thing yeah you guys want you want I'm not hungry that's would you want to do bathroom break Andrew needs a smoke and

(4:50:50) then we'll go for what another 30 minutes but before you guys uh get up I do want to let a couple chats come

(4:50:56) through really quick here so we have uh that's pissed at

(4:51:03) you1 that's not working myON wants to collab he already reached out to you and

(4:51:08) maybe the master debater as well would love to see you all together oh slash

(4:51:14) yeah well Andrew you've been on their show a couple times so hold on we got some other chats coming Daddy thank you

(4:51:20) oh my God I can't believe I wow thank you for the uh oh my God that's ridiculous okay we have Lucas here Lucas

(4:51:29) donated $100 for the love of God with these gender studies nebulous talking point

(4:51:35) three what virginity is defined as how ABT no Hyman no d di if it's good enough

(4:51:42) no diamond is C enough for me wait sorry just repeat it just I don't know if they heard no Hyman no diamond is crazy oh

(4:51:50) okay all right no Hyman no diamond it's crazy why why is it crazy just for Lucas

(4:51:55) cuz he's curious um I mean I I think when we

(4:52:02) again I I just don't know why men fetishize someone who has little sexual

(4:52:09) experience why why would it be a problem even if they did uh cuz I think when we're talking

(4:52:16) about like someone who's making decisions um or someone who's well balanced um and well-rounded that

(4:52:22) obviously with more experience you make better decisions well this assumes that the person has more sexual experience

(4:52:28) than the person has none what like well you can I I don't understand why can't you fetishize a woman having had no

(4:52:35) sexual experience and have no sexual experience yourself it's bad

(4:52:41) um okay again I I think when you are centering the fact that she doesn't have

(4:52:48) sexual experience yeah then that is um because you see you have more

(4:52:55) opportunity to manipulate to coce to um

() 

(4:53:00) to abuse oh I see so then um I just go to got to quickly

(4:53:07) ask if the roles are reversed if um if a woman selects on a Man based on the fact

(4:53:13) that he hasn't gone out and slept with a bunch of women so let's say that there's a man in town and he's well you know

(4:53:19) he's pretty well known for being a ladies man you know the women all like him a lot and he bangs a lot of them um

(4:53:26) and this woman doesn't really like that she thinks that that's kind of ick uh you think that she she really shouldn't

(4:53:32) find it very icky right um should she find it icky that he

(4:53:37) slept with a lot of women yeah I [Music]

(4:53:43) mean okay does she I I don't I don't think no I I don't think that um this

(4:53:50) idea that like having multiple conceptual relationships means that you're icky oh I see so let me I just

(4:53:56) want to make sure I got it clear if you went to a town and there was a guy in the town had a reputation for [ __ ] a

(4:54:03) lot of women like he just did this a lot um you wouldn't make any preconceived

(4:54:08) judgments about him maybe being a playable maybe being a player I guess what you mean by playboy or player you know like

(4:54:16) uh he doesn't like to commit he likes to play the field he likes to have a lot of sex he likes to maybe lie to get into

(4:54:22) women's pants you know like preconceived notions which would come with a guy who normally has sex with a lot of women why

(4:54:27) am I making this assessment because you are a pattern recognition machine and

(4:54:32) notate that engaging with him well I'm just going to ask you flat out do you do have you ever known guys like that yeah

(4:54:39) oh okay and the types of guys that you know who are like that aren't they generally players um and so again just so I

(4:54:48) understand the criteria that you mean by player are they just someone who is interested in casual sex or are you also

(4:54:53) adding that criteria that they use the means of manipulation in order to gain access all the above they like all of

(4:54:59) that um I mean I wouldn't necessarily place the criteria that he uses the

(4:55:05) means of manipulation but could I say he has an interest in casual sex sure you

(4:55:10) wouldn't uh ever associate any negative characteristics with him though just because he had slept with a lot of women

(4:55:15) sure correct never um NOP as as long as I'm aware

(4:55:20) that they're consensual would it give you the I um no no no could you for

(4:55:27) foresee that there's other women who it would give them the yck sure then why can't it give the ick to the

(4:55:32) man give the ick to the man well again I think this is just kind of like um

(4:55:38) certain social purviews that we see with in society to where somehow having um

(4:55:43) multiple consensual relationships is dirty or gross and kind of the you know

(4:55:49) I I I just think women shouldn't have the ick impurity culture so you think that women shouldn't have the I think

(4:55:55) it's yeah the reverse of Purity culture right right so when so it just depends on what your goals are in terms of so

(4:56:01) then virgins should give men who've had a lot of sexual partners a chance yeah I don't think you should NE

(4:56:08) you shouldn't base your decision making their body I agree we don't have anything to argue about if a woman has

(4:56:14) no body count and a man has a really really high body count she should not make any

(4:56:21) preconceived judgments about him and should date him and should not assume for a second that that

(4:56:26) man just wants to take her virginity she should not assume that okay

(4:56:33) right um no I don't think she should assume that okay good no then I think

(4:56:38) we're on the same page okay all right wow a shocker let some other chats I saw

(4:56:44) you kind of eyeballing the pizza I mean I'm really not hungry can I have another drink though we uh we can get you

(4:56:50) another drink uh once Andrew's back we'll get to the rest of the chats here

(4:56:55) I I won't let any come through unless everybody is at the table uh Blake is going to get you a uh

(4:57:04) another drink if you can pass him the other one appreciate you rock rocking so

(4:57:10) you just don't like pineapple pizza or what's up no I've actually um debated on Tik Tok if pineapple should go on pizza

(4:57:15) and I was Pro you're you're the pro pineapple on Pizza okay I don't think he should have social prescription on what

(4:57:22) you or like any kind of prescription on what you put on pizza got it okay is it you just don't like you don't want to

(4:57:28) eat it right now I'm just not hungry I don't know what what you want me to tell you okay you know that's that's if I

(4:57:34) took a bite would it make you happier uh it would actually why whoa

(4:57:40) get your mind out of the gutter I feel like you're I'm not in the gutter get your mind out of the gutter I don't know you're trying to say like I want to see

(4:57:47) you eat a pizza like in a sexual way are you are you flirting like what do you what's going on here stop I look you're

(4:57:55) like trying to put say say I'm wanting you to watch you eat a pizza I'm just

(4:58:00) I'm not into that all you had to say is I don't like to eat alone it look if you the reason that's fine look if you want

(4:58:06) to deal with dudes who like watching you eat food I'm look I don't King Shame I'm not a king shamer I'm just saying if

(4:58:13) like if that's what you want I'm just I was more just I got you pizza I don't

(4:58:18) want to watch you eat it I just I you know I thought it would be a kind gesture understand it would be a kind

(4:58:25) gesture that's all you had to say good talk uh so guys uh I I don't

(4:58:31) know if we're going to do the 16 I mean because nobody else is eating I was eating awkwardly there uh but those

(4:58:37) those that did come through what we're gonna pull them up what why would what's the thing we were doing if

(4:58:43) we're all eating huh what are we not doing anymore oh so well we were going to do like a pizza roast session while

(4:58:51) y'all were eating your pizza but you're not hungry Andrew doesn't want to have

(4:58:57) pineapple you had on the show so many times yeah and yeah and you don't know

(4:59:04) that he wouldn't eat it well you know this was like a punishment for Andrew

(4:59:10) the pineapple pizza he actually we he agreed he agreed off screen to that he

(4:59:20) never he he told me he was like Brian we'll do it we can fine we'll do it can I can I tie this last thing off real

(4:59:26) quick before we get to the super chats cuz we're like right there right okay absolutely so I I thought when you left

(4:59:32) we had agreed on something what well yeah we agreed but I just wanted to tie it off with the agreement that's why I

(4:59:38) wanted the agreement okay are we to assume then that you have a high body

() 

(4:59:43) count are we well it it doesn't matter so you should tell us what it is I if it

(4:59:48) doesn't matter why would I tell you because it doesn't matter no I I would think if it mattered I would tell you

(4:59:55) well if it doesn't matter why wouldn't you because it doesn't matter if I would answer any question that you wanted that

(5:00:01) didn't matter to me uh no like when you go to court and like someone's well I'm

(5:00:06) just giving another example when someone's asked a question and they're like irrelevant you know it doesn't matter they don't answer erroneous oh

(5:00:14) erroneous yeah so so no I I don't disclose you don't you don't so it does matter no it doesn't that's why I don't

(5:00:20) disclose you don't disclose because the reputation maybe that comes along with it no it has nothing to do with

(5:00:25) reputation then if you're not concerned about reputational damage and it doesn't matter why not just disclose if it doesn't matter why would I I have no

(5:00:32) motivation I mean I'm sorry you can keep asking me 10 ways from some I'm not going to disclose I'll just ask you this

(5:00:38) what's your favorite color um that's a good question I would say

(5:00:44) like wine colored kind of like a purplish pink or pinkish purple did that

(5:00:49) matter yeah I think what my favorite color is matters especially if you're like picking out um a shirt for me did

(5:00:57) that matter in the context of the debate I don't know no it doesn't matter right okay so uh okay here's one um do

(5:01:07) you prefer water in a cup or do you prefer I don't know water in a

(5:01:13) wine glass are you getting me water sure okay then I'd prefer it in a wine glass

(5:01:19) I don't have a wine glass oh then I guess it doesn't matter oh okay so you just want it in a

(5:01:24) cup uh sure okay that's what you got a cup so then the preference doesn't

(5:01:29) really matter uh no no okay great you only a cup so if you're willing to disclose

(5:01:35) preferences that don't matter why not disclose this one doesn't matter it what reason do I have to because it doesn't

(5:01:41) matter I would think that would be the reason I don't disclose that would be the reason you should disclose no I

(5:01:47) think if it mattered I would disclose right I don't you disclose material

(5:01:53) information I think it would M if it didn't matter you would have no trouble disclosing something that didn't matter

(5:01:59) if I were going to have sex with someone and I had an STD do you think I should disclose yeah because it matters yeah

(5:02:05) sure yeah yeah but if somebody asked you if you had it to STD would you say no if you didn't

(5:02:10) even though having sex with him it wouldn't matter what like if you didn't have an STD and you had sex with someone

(5:02:16) you're not going to ever transmit them in an STD right so it doesn't matter so when she just disclosed to a person

(5:02:23) didn't have STDs wait that does matter because obviously if I don't disclose they think that I do right so so it

(5:02:30) matters to them so then in this case it does matter for the purpose of something then matters to them right yeah this

(5:02:35) matters to me okay well so dis close it I I'm not well doesn't matter because it

(5:02:40) doesn't matter mhm I thought you said you only disclose if it does matter yeah if it mattered I would but it doesn't

(5:02:47) but it does matter I want to know it matters well it matters to you for the purpose of this conversation it matters

(5:02:52) but so you got I don't think it that matters that you think it matters but you think it matters that the guy well

(5:02:59) if I if I didn't disclose you know he's like do you have an STD and I'm like that doesn't matter what are we doing do

(5:03:05) you want to have sex it's really strange to me that this thing that just me nothing to you is also a thing that you

(5:03:12) refuse to disclose that's really weird it doesn't matter why would I disclose

(5:03:17) because it doesn't matter to you exactly so why should it matter to disclose it that's super weird makes no sense I

(5:03:24) don't think it's super weird at all okay well then it's just irrelevant let me just let me just follow with this last

(5:03:29) thing um so can you tell right um that

(5:03:36) there is or do you agree with me that there is reputational Dam Dage that comes with women who have a high body

(5:03:42) count yeah yeah you agree with that right so does it stand to reason from my

(5:03:47) perspective that I would think that you weren't disclosing that because it was really high and it would cause you

(5:03:52) reputational damage um I mean sure that could be a possible explanation I mean that's a

(5:04:00) likely one right uh no I disagree well isn't it more likely than somebody saying it doesn't matter but I'm not

(5:04:06) going to tell you anyway like does doesn't that seem like it's a more likely explanation then I

(5:04:13) won't tell you based on the principle of it doesn't matter so therefore I want even though it doesn't matter to me at

(5:04:19) all I just don't so I guess when we're talking about why you want the

(5:04:24) disclosure mhm why is that because I want to see if you're consistent well so

(5:04:31) this is just for the purposes of the debate yeah that's why matters I'm checking your consistency and it's not

(5:04:36) very consistent so you're giving me I don't think you're your body count what are you evaluating well you're just

(5:04:42) giving me you're giving me reason to believe that you're lying to me that what am I lying about I'll explain

(5:04:47) you're giving me reason to believe that based on the fact that you think that having a high body count causes women

(5:04:52) reputational damage uh that if you really thought that this didn't matter right i' know for sure that you wouldn't

(5:04:59) be getting any reputational damage by expressing it if you had a very low body count however if you did have a very if

(5:05:06) you hang on if you did have a very high body count you think that that would cause you reputational damage by your own admission so which is more likely it

(5:05:13) seems more likely that you do have one me sure but then you would be like implying that I care well the only

(5:05:18) reason I'm implying that you care is because you won't say it no yeah that seems to be the implication I I disagree

(5:05:25) well but the likelihood the likelihood from my perspec you tell me what what is my body count I have no idea yeah how

(5:05:32) would I know unless you told me exactly wouldn't um I assume it's high

(5:05:37) if I just wanted to protect my reputation wouldn't I just lie and just be like you know what you're right you

(5:05:43) could but it is the age of the internet where somebody could say no that's not true I slept with her and another guy's like you I slept with her to you're

(5:05:49) really putting stock in into into the fact that my um possible previous

(5:05:55) partners are watching well all it would take all it would take is the wrong I would say if I were protecting my

(5:06:01) reputation I would just lie so the fact that I'm not disclosing yeah but you doesn't say that reputation would you

(5:06:07) can get caught in a lie it would be very unlikely for me to be caught giving a false body count uh yeah

(5:06:16) absolutely cuz I could just be like they're lying okay well of course he's going to try and say oh she's lying it's low I don't know that guy well we have

(5:06:22) children right child a child yes so at least one right are we sure so we know so

(5:06:30) immaculate conception or artificial insemination right so we know at Le at least

(5:06:35) one great are you okay with admitting that it's at least one I mean what does it matter I mean

(5:06:41) clearly I think you can deduce that yeah right we can deduce it yep so we we can use logic so we can use logic to deduce

(5:06:48) the truth of matter and if it is the case that it doesn't matter but you're unwilling to disclose I again I I don't

(5:06:56) think it supports that it's just a reputation thing because then I could just lie and be like you know what you're right answer yeah but you can get caught in lies it's too and that damages

(5:07:03) your reputation I don't I I could just continue to lie and be like that guy's lying he never slept with me yes and and

(5:07:09) then other people could bring proofs right I what I don't know whatever there

(5:07:15) are what proof is there how do I how would I know how yeah I don't think there's I have no idea it's just very

(5:07:20) it's a very strange standard to say weird a thing doesn't matter but I do know that it causes reputational damage

(5:07:26) if it is high and I refuse to disclose it even though it doesn't matter corre yeah I mean again I like I said I think

(5:07:31) I've I've told you if I was worried about reputational damage I would just concede you and lie do you think it

(5:07:36) stands to reason that if a man wants to know your your body count it's because

(5:07:42) they think that uh you have a bad reputation of sleeping with a lot of different men um no I think there can be

(5:07:50) multiple reasons that someone would want to know your body count I think uh obviously like you've indicated a lot of

(5:07:55) social prescriptions uh come with like a high body count um but I also think

(5:08:02) excuse me I also think if you've been with someone a long time it can just be out

(5:08:08) of curiosity true yeah and do you think that the stigma associated with reputational damage a

(5:08:14) man might want to avoid a woman like that so that they don't end up being associated with that woman's bad

(5:08:21) reputation um yeah sure I don't know so then it seems like it's a perfectly valid preference to want women who have

(5:08:26) low body counts I I think it's weird that men kind of evaluate the quality of

(5:08:31) their partner oh no women also evaluate women based on how many sex partners they've had so when you're I I know

(5:08:39) you're married what what do you look are you're not you're a virgin yeah virgin virgin yeah do you want a romantic

(5:08:47) relationship do I want a romantic yes yeah yeah what what would you want that

(5:08:53) long term longterm yes yes what what would you want from a

(5:08:59) partner if you virin is that it is there any other qualities you would want for a long-term

(5:09:06) partner um no virgin like she can be like obese and stuff but like virgin why

(5:09:13) don't why you dragging me into this why you dragging me intoing that's not fair the it's not

(5:09:18) fair it's not fair he's married so obviously it doesn't um you know there's not necessarily um an assessment of

(5:09:25) looking for your next potential partner but um so my point but let's say my my

(5:09:31) my wife died tomorrow okay right well what would you want in a partner I would definitely want a woman with a low body

(5:09:37) count okay is there anything else yeah oh yeah sure all the uh like all the

() 

(5:09:43) normal things that uh people would look for woman it was loyal she was very kind to me she was kind to children she was

(5:09:49) kind to the elderly so kind yeah kindness matters to me oh right but I'm just saying you said kind three

(5:09:55) different ways so I got it loyal kind mhm loyal kind um somebody wasn't in uh

(5:10:02) didn't or wasn't prone to nagging that would be a big one for me prone to nagging mhm okay wait

(5:10:09) I'm sorry I did think of one other thing that I I do look for is large laia no

(5:10:15) knees large labia I big laia is that uh Le minor or or labia

(5:10:23) both can be large both can be large yeah so Audi like the wizard sleeve I'm I no

(5:10:29) this I actually do prefer large lebia are your only conditions like based on

(5:10:35) their appearance no there's other conditions like she has to bow to me not

(5:10:40) okay you're done no lit no literally so anyway these are these are like figurativ these are like standard qualities that I think are pretty shared

(5:10:48) across sure so I mean we just named two though loyal kind um you said no nagging yeah no nagging do you do my life easier

(5:10:56) do you uh view like communication is nagging or yeah you think being

(5:11:02) communicative with your partner as yeah she needs to understand what my needs are okay yeah that um okay I guess I'm

(5:11:10) not sure what nagging is so yeah I think we you don't know what nagging is really um wasn't I just nagging you to

(5:11:17) give me your body count oh yeah you definitely were so so then we do know what nagging is I guess I'm trying to

(5:11:23) understand nagging to what your degree like if she asked you will you take the garbage out and you're like yeah I will and then you don't like yeah [ __ ] like

(5:11:29) that yeah I don't want I don't want nagging no nagging yeah I got to we can come right back to it but there's a

(5:11:35) there's so many messages coming through that like basically done and then we're just

(5:11:40) done let me let two come in and then we'll do the rest just cuz I don't want them to fall off cuz uh streamlabs does

(5:11:48) that Daddy mods donated $100 sent it in kind of twice I guess messed you to do a

(5:11:54) podcast together pretty sure he spoke to The Master debater about it as well that

(5:11:59) collab is what we've been waiting for BTW Karen good luck you've lost horribly

(5:12:06) now you got me the first time on your username I'm not going to refer I'm going to call you Dem model still bad um

() 

(5:12:14) model thank you for the uh message I do appreciate it thank you oh we got Lucas coming in Lucas donated

(5:12:20) $100 woman you know nothing ABT the scientific research. there is not one

(5:12:26) study out there and there are many that does not indicate a strong and I mean really strong male preference towards

(5:12:32) female Chastity oh do you want to respond to I I'm sorry what does it say

(5:12:37) women you know nothing about the scientif ific research there is not one study out there that does not indicate a

(5:12:42) strong and I mean really strong male preference towards female um I think that would just be

(5:12:48) culture dependent and why is it a cross culture why is what a cross culture the

(5:12:54) fact that men uh value Youth and Chastity um are you referring to like

(5:13:00) the evolutionary psychology no refence just referring to the the demonstration

(5:13:05) of basically everywhere this is asked um by pollsters and by various

(5:13:12) researchers if you prefer women of x age most men choose around the same ages for

(5:13:18) women that they find the most attractive and the same thing for men uh looking

(5:13:24) for Chastity that seems to be across the board what thee what what is the age

(5:13:30) most men choose is this is this regardless of their age yeah what is the age I think it's like 18 to 26 or 24

(5:13:38) okay yeah they prefer it and do women have that similar no no no they tend

(5:13:44) to um want men around their same age right and find them like same I think

(5:13:50) there would be a hard argument to say that this is just an innate determination and not some form of

(5:13:56) social conditioning across all cultures correct that's truly baffling to me like

(5:14:04) these cultures that have very little to do with each other still have preference toward Chastity what would you base that

(5:14:11) on as far as social condition I just again we don't know what cultures number one that they are evaluating but I also

(5:14:19) think that there's like the global idea that paternity is really important um

(5:14:24) where previous to like patriarchal constructions when it was more egalitarian um you know not knowing

(5:14:32) paternity wasn't necessarily a big deal because I could even argue that in terms

(5:14:38) of uh Community survival that not knowing paternity could be a beneficial because then men that are engaged with

(5:14:44) women now they have an investment and obviously The Offspring living and surviving and she would have more access

(5:14:50) to to resources from those different men this seems like it would be offset very quickly by just saying a man's primary

(5:14:57) edict and objective evolutionarily would be to pass on his genetics and he would

(5:15:02) need to know that his genetics were actually passed on not another man's in his dead so I don't necessarily think

(5:15:07) that that's like just an that's the primary Edict of all living organisms is to pass on their genetics

(5:15:14) no to pass on their genetics I think it's also survival the your gentics then

(5:15:20) um that's the primary urge and drive then what's the point of marriage or relationships well okay you can have

(5:15:28) factors past this that human beings value but the primary edict from an

(5:15:33) evolutionary standpoint the prime direct I would see I would see men wanting

(5:15:39) um not relationships at all just be engaging with multiple women having and

(5:15:46) then having no investment a lot of them do that do you think men should have investment in child's uh rearing yes but

(5:15:52) this does not contend with my question before you change it right is not the primary Edict of The evolutionary

(5:15:59) dictate to pass your genetics on no I would say survival well what's the point purpose

(5:16:05) of survival what's the point of survival mhm um that your community continues

(5:16:11) yeah it continues through what passing on your genetics right but even if you

(5:16:17) don't pass on your genetics your community can still continue there it's not going to continue without people

(5:16:22) passing on their genetics or living organisms passing genetics all people need to pass on their genetics yes but

(5:16:28) all people do need to have the drive to pass on their genetics um again you can have the drive

(5:16:35) but even if you haven't completed it yeah but you have the drive to complete it even when you have completed

(5:16:41) it you still have the drive to continue to complete it right so I again I don't see why like paternity would need to be

(5:16:47) certain the whole point of you getting horny and a man getting horny is to pass on their genetics otherwise there would

(5:16:54) be no reason to get hor so well then if he's done that then why wouldn't he can continue to do it I so he wants to

(5:17:02) continue to pass his genetics on over and over and over again one vessel can accommodate this it doesn't need it

(5:17:08) doesn't take 50 vessels obviously even if you pass on your genetics and then the children

(5:17:14) don't survive and your community doesn't survive then you have an achieve the goal yeah maybe not but that doesn't

(5:17:19) mean that your primary edict is not to do that but again I don't think that um

(5:17:25) you're just descriptively saying but what if it doesn't happen and I'm like yeah then it doesn't happen but still the motivation the primary is pass on

(5:17:31) genetics but obviously too it's also for the society to continue and the only way it continues by passing on genetics I I

(5:17:39) agree but obviously like if a woman um is sleeping with multiple men and then

(5:17:45) there are children um all of those men could have a potential investment in that child survival no they have no way

(5:17:51) to verify they've passed on their genetics I know but they would have the potential investment in be yeah listen

(5:17:57) let's so Brian here his ultimate Drive let's say is to pass on his genetics and mine okay so let's say that Brian wait I

(5:18:05) wanted to pass yours on yeah well I want to pass mine on he right so he ends up with some chick with

(5:18:12) one of his friends and they bang her okay I'm sorry he ends up with with some chick with one of his friends one of him

(5:18:18) and one of his friends bang the same chick so there's a third guy okay not a third guy second guy bang his chick well you're why did they got why does she

(5:18:24) have being my chick I'm not there listen I'm drawing a comparison okay I'm sorry I'm with one woman mhm He has screwed

(5:18:31) one woman and this other guy has screwed one woman right I'm just with one woman one woman's with me I'm assured my

(5:18:37) genetics are passed on they are not assured their genetics are passed on I me you're not they're not assured their

(5:18:44) genetics are passed on if the primary edicts pass your genetics on it's not to oh I don't share with another guy and

(5:18:50) hope your genetics get passed on that's not how that works well I mean obviously if your child dies then your genes are

(5:18:55) not passed on then you try to have another child because it's your primary edict I I mean I think ultimately

(5:19:02) primary edict would be for survival um of like yourself but no I I don't think

(5:19:09) necessarily like there's an Edict of like Legacy if that's what you're talking about literally every living

(5:19:14) organism's primary goal from an evolutionary standpoint has to be to pass on their genetic material otherwise

(5:19:22) survival the fittest doesn't work you can't be the fittest species if you can't reproduce well also but if you

(5:19:28) can't survive yes based on certain conditions but you can't survive because you can't reproduce I I agree that

(5:19:36) reproduction is an aspect of it but even if you do reproduce it doesn't mean that

(5:19:41) there'll be the necessary conditions for your genes to continue if your genes don't survive yeah but that's a

(5:19:48) descriptor right that's not a descriptor which contends with the primary edict being reproduction it does because when

(5:19:53) when evaluating a matate it not only comes into obviously their capacity for fertility but their capacity to care for

(5:19:59) the young we aren't just like we are social creatures and so there are social

() 

(5:20:05) aspects that come into the aspects of mating and I would argue too that prior

(5:20:11) um prior to other civilizations that this was a common method that women had

(5:20:17) multiple partners so that multiple children could behal so that the community and Society could continue

(5:20:22) There Are pagan there are pagan tribes with this happened I agree right but for the most part it didn't there are some I

(5:20:29) I would disagree with that there's well look then that's a historical I think your position I'm I'm okay right now I

(5:20:35) think your position is ahistorical no it's not it's ahistorical to say men may have had multiple women women did not

(5:20:41) generally have multiple men they were not in a position to have multiple men and from what time period are we discussing I mean this all of human

(5:20:47) history I mean no I would say for 50,000 25,000 years um no there were more poly

(5:20:54) Amorous relationships not yes between men and multiple women not women and M

(5:21:00) me I'm talking about polys where women have as much multiple partners brothers would marry sisters

(5:21:07) they would switch partners so on and so forth I mean I even told you about the example of Rome where they would have wedding night orgies just to assume like

(5:21:14) that their family line is Contin when it came to Rome men were in the position of authority over wives right and they

(5:21:21) generally married virgins they would have sex that's true with women who were not virgins and even with men it was a

(5:21:28) but there was was still very much a traditional practice that also there would be multiple men even that doesn't

(5:21:36) guarantee your paternal line yeah that masturbation no I'm not saying with each

(5:21:41) other I'm saying with with the wife like the there would be wedding night or yes no that's ahistorical too it's not

(5:21:48) ahistorical Romans didn't tell people to come over and [ __ ] their wives that's very much ahistorical I can give you aor

(5:21:54) it's super rare that that happened what are you talking about the RO especially in the Roman Empire it's it's insane no

(5:22:00) they didn't that's a totally ahistorical also AIC The Source once you give me the per you can give me this the source I'm

(5:22:06) telling you it's totally ahistorical that um that women um had multiple men yes men had

(5:22:15) multiple women that's true but it's a historic you know why too women can only get pregnant by one guy at a time men on

(5:22:22) the other hand they can impregnate a 100 women as many times as you know what I mean again we have to determine the fact

(5:22:29) of survival ship like if a man impregnates 100 women and so he's

(5:22:34) passing his jeans on you know the these hundred women don't have um um Community or support when it comes to resources

(5:22:42) and caring for the child then the children are going to die and then what

(5:22:47) yeah but this is baked into the pie that would be a lesson for monogamy right no I think that's a Lon aren't you

(5:22:54) assuring the most amount of resources possible by having one man responsible for the child uh no obviously you would

(5:23:01) ensure more aspects uh more resources if multiple men were responsible for the child if they could reinforce like oh I

(5:23:07) have an uncle that's helpful they're somewhat responsible for my child I guess they're part of my family but

(5:23:13) having one man who gathers resource specifically for that child and that woman seems like a way more effective

(5:23:19) dating or strategy it would be no communal uh Gathering and communal ownership would be the most effective

(5:23:25) strategy you can have communal Gathering communal ownership where every man still owns the child and is the primary

(5:23:31) caregiver for that child who's his I agree I agree also you can also have men who who

(5:23:38) are potentially are invested in obviously the CH the children growing

(5:23:43) and the community surviving okay there there's no need for pity which thing makes more sense we

(5:23:50) have a community but I'm responsible for my Offspring if paternity certainty was

(5:23:56) was such like a valuable thing why why is it um not easily detected like you

(5:24:03) know when it comes to maternity excuse me obviously we always know who the is but you don't always

(5:24:09) know who the father is correct so doesn't really matter yeah so that like completely blows your own point out

(5:24:15) makes no sense you're not actually assured yourself paternity correct neither are

(5:24:21) men cor correct yeah so the only thing you know is that is that it came from you community community resources and

(5:24:28) obviously having multiple people invest in the outcome of the offspring would be

(5:24:35) the most successful multiple people will still invest in the outcome of The Offspring just by being family to The

(5:24:40) Offspring even if they didn't are not directly responsible for The Offspring meaning they did not reproduce The

(5:24:45) Offspring okay so you have uncles and aunts and brothers and sisters and cousins and whatever yeah there are a

(5:24:51) lot of indigenous tribes that had the same philosophy that you know the children belong to everybody yeah but

(5:24:57) men don't want to share their women I again it depends on the culture there were many indigenous tribes who

(5:25:04) children belonged to everybody um even Native American tribes didn't operate this way there are American tribes who

(5:25:11) did operate this way some but it's rare and by the way looking at an example of where polygamy could happen it's still

(5:25:18) an a it's completely an ahistoric standard to say that because that because polygamy did happen that it was

(5:25:25) common across all cultures it was not it's not the case it was no it wasn't I

(5:25:30) mean what what time period are you talking about I guess you're talking about all of human history yes all of human history I mean I I don't know how

(5:25:36) we can go back and forth saying one's a historical Ur historical hisorical like it would essentially just come down to

(5:25:41) sources yeah we would just have to prove our sources yeah so in this case you're going to come up with sources that give

(5:25:48) us direct evidence that 25,000 years ago women were mostly uh polygamous really

(5:25:54) uh yeah that paternity that male paternity was not at the center of of of of society that it

(5:26:02) didn't matter because the children were um so it wasal so it's matrilineal yes

(5:26:08) instead of patrilineal correct yeah it's totally a historical okay I'm fine with that okay okay um shoot a couple fell off

(5:26:18) here so I'm going to have to find another way to pull these up but uh I'm going to let some of the chats come

(5:26:24) through Moonlight donated $100 hi Rachel and Andrew THX for

() 

(5:26:30) letting me know details about her sex life been wondering for years and it's finally being addressed I can now rest

(5:26:38) easy but I don't think he'll ever fall asleep around y' yo Moonlight thank you uh very much

(5:26:46) man appreciate the uh message uh we have a bunch more coming

(5:26:52) through so I'm going to let them come through me Birdman donated

(5:27:12) or a drink a Bloody

(5:27:17) Mary we have uh some more you guys can respond to these by the way we have Justin Martin thank you Justin Martin

(5:27:23) donated $69 Andrew's obis skating from the pizza by engaging in the debate if you don't

(5:27:30) eat the pizza you lose I'll take the

(5:27:36) L uh shoot I don't yeah unfortunately some fell off um I'm G to see if I can

(5:27:41) get them back though one moment guys uh we have they'll be red regardless but they might not pop up on screen 4ore _

(5:27:51) clowncore Goblin donated $69 everything she says slave master

(5:27:56) style privileges her gender telling you you're not allowed to be grossed out by promise cuity but it's okay to get the

(5:28:03) it if a guy so much as Smiles at you wrong I mean I never made that claim

(5:28:10) okay we have let's see here we have membered coming in again oh getry

(5:28:17) donated $69 how you about Crystal getting into them the crystals over there the

(5:28:24) crystals was quite the controversy before the podcast started give her the crystals

(5:28:30) please just just place them on the table right right just place them right there

(5:28:35) thank you y um okay what are we

(5:28:42) doing I'm not sure really okay he did bring up crystals though so he did it

(5:28:48) was which one is your favorite you the green one um I mean you have to be

(5:28:53) General you have to be really gentle with the crystals you were you were a bit that was a bit it be color

(5:28:58) preference I would like the green one okay cool um all right thank you Birdman

(5:29:04) we have Lucas coming in here thank you man Lucas donated $100 we do know what cultures were

(5:29:11) studied from tribes in the Amazon to tribes in papular New Guinea also it's

(5:29:17) not just survival dot it's both natural selection survival and sexual selection

(5:29:25) reproduction okay nice nice all right we got a few more coming in there's just

(5:29:31) usually a bit of a pause we have lululu and then oh Flynn A Gifted tier

(5:29:39) one lululu donated $69 this girl has an inability to

(5:29:44) concede every time you get close to cornering her with logic she starts to ask you to Define terms as a distraction

(5:29:52) technique LOL when she can't argue she detracts I mean I think there's things

(5:29:58) I've conceited yeah but she also um like there's only so much you can do

(5:30:04) when when people bite these kinds of bullets you're just like okay oh I don't know what you where you go with that uh

(5:30:10) graffo tagged men evolve to spread genes maximizing Offspring women seek long-term support to ensure child

(5:30:16) survival marriage balances this giving men paternity certainty and women stability for raising kids makes sense

(5:30:23) that's a way better strategy or seems like a way better survival strategy one sec here I'm just double I mean do you

(5:30:30) do you think if we're talking just that marriage is essentially what determines uh obviously then that fraction would be

(5:30:37) separated from the community why because that that's the foundation

() 

(5:30:43) right yeah why would they be separated from the community well cuz that's what else do you

(5:30:49) need well you I mean need support yeah exactly so it wouldn't be marriage that

(5:30:54) would determine the he didn't say marriage he said monogamy they did they said marriage I thought he said monogamy

(5:31:00) what did he say that's I'm not sure to be honest yeah that I mean that involves marriage yeah but um I thought he said

(5:31:06) monogamy Maybe I'm Wrong but in any case uh it doesn't matter his point is correct it makes way more sense for a

(5:31:13) woman for resource perspective to have a man who specifically guards her and that

(5:31:18) Offspring if he's always unsure of The Offspring what's his incentive to guard her and we don't look from protection from one individual we look from

(5:31:25) protection from Community yeah okay so the thing is is

(5:31:30) um you get that Community through this single person giving you this Offspring

(5:31:37) I I disagree I think there are a lot of communities where even children are viewed as um not even necessarily just

(5:31:45) the mother's children but Other Women Within that Community are also just as responsible for instilling values and

(5:31:50) raising the children well help me out here do you think it would be better then if women could just like communally

(5:31:55) had sex with men and men were not assured of paternity um I mean yeah that's

(5:32:02) definitely a possible outcome I don't like to necessarily give uh sexual or

(5:32:07) sexual or relationship prescriptions I think everyone has you think it would be better though better if men were not

(5:32:14) able to determine paternity um and women just had sex with

(5:32:20) whatever me that they wanted to but and they couldn't assure paternity do you think that's better a better outcome

(5:32:26) than knowing who the father is in terms of survival sure so so then you should

(5:32:34) prescribe that for women right yeah yeah I do think when we um you want women to

(5:32:40) be horse basically um again I I I think like I

(5:32:45) don't agree with the term that you used um well you want them to [ __ ] a bunch of men so that they're not a shed of

(5:32:51) paternity no I I even said that that's not um that's not my position I think

(5:32:58) you just said it was your position no I I think when we talk about like the idea of family and Community it doesn't have

(5:33:04) to be this nuclear aspect with certain people who are biolog ically related

(5:33:09) wearing the domineering hats I think we can look at it through more of a communal um I forget what country it is

(5:33:15) I can look it up if you want um there was one woman who had nine children and she ended up giving two to one of her

(5:33:21) infertile friends and um they ask like are you upset with that are your children upset with that and they're

(5:33:26) like no we we both love the children anal though um it's just an example

(5:33:31) though of like how but if you say it's a better survival mechanism for women to do this so you would prescribe that do

(5:33:38) do this you can't actually tell them not to be [ __ ] because and here's why I I would say that if if we look at certain

(5:33:44) reproductive strategies in terms of society that uh female bonding um leads to really great

(5:33:51) outcomes of of lessen fanticide and and longer uh child SP uh child lifespan or

(5:33:57) more success for child span yeah but if for a man not to be assured of paternity

(5:34:03) that the woman would have to be sleeping with multiple men okay I mean or he could just assume

(5:34:08) that so then it's actually a bad survival strategy for women or better survival strategy for women right from

(5:34:15) your perspective for the woman I I don't know why we can't have like um I if

(5:34:20) people want to be in monogamous relationships I don't think that's that's not what we're talking about about whether or not you think that men

(5:34:27) and women can be in any type of relationship we're asking about better worse as far as outcomes go and so if

(5:34:33) it's a better outcome I would think you would prescribe the better outcome if it's a better survival strategy for

(5:34:39) women to sleep with multiple men and not then the man not be assured of the

(5:34:45) paternity of the child as the better survival outcome for the woman then why wouldn't you prescribe that for women you would

(5:34:50) right um uh yeah I I do think that would yield um better outcomes if we were less uh

(5:34:58) nuclear and more communal essentially individualistic and more commun so then you're prescribing that women sleeping

(5:35:05) with multiple men and then hiding the paternity of I mean it's not necessarily hiding well yeah you just don't know

(5:35:12) right so you can't lie about what you don't know right and obviously um I think uh when it comes to like

(5:35:20) partnership um people do find uh love and and stability uh with with

(5:35:27) multiple people MH and do you think that a man who like I don't know for instance

(5:35:33) me I adore my kids like I love them to death um

(5:35:38) wouldn't that take that away from me because now I would not even be sure if they were mine I

(5:35:44) mean uh forgive me they're they're not yours are they no they are mine biologically yeah I have biological

(5:35:51) children yes um so you were misinformed weren't you by Trolls but anyway go

(5:35:57) ahead no I'm sorry yes I have step children and biological children both so do you feel that your stepchildren aren't your children no I still love

() 

(5:36:03) them and adore them so I'm sorry they're not your children or they are they are but there's still a different

(5:36:09) relationship a different relationship you're doing it yourself I mean I'm not child wearing of children that are

(5:36:17) this is incorrect biological yeah no that's incorrect so there's a distinction in biological versus

(5:36:24) stepchildren yes there is a distinction there I mean for you sure yeah for

(5:36:31) everybody there I mean we wouldn't even have the classification if there was no distinction doesn't mean I don't love them um so are you just talking a

(5:36:38) distinction in terms of biological distinction or are you talking about how you love and care for them yeah I'm glad

(5:36:43) that I know who each child's father is or is not including uh my Offspring yes

(5:36:50) I I'm wondering though do you love and care for your step children different children oh okay course yes of course I

(5:36:56) love and well no you didn't finish answering the question before I was saying yes I know I never made a distinction in how I treated them okay

(5:37:03) but you can't make a distinction in your heart for who you adore or don't adore right so yeah so for instance wouldn't

(5:37:10) you agree that if you were raising um like I don't know a child

(5:37:15) that you you came in contact with with by the time they were six or seven for instance right that it's going to be a

(5:37:21) different form of relationship than the child that came out of your womb uh yeah but if I I I think that just necessarily

(5:37:27) has to do with timing and not um the fact that I'm biologically related to

(5:37:33) them well but if you were biologically related to them the timing would be fine

(5:37:39) right I no I think I would have the same like let let's just say for example um that you know I I gave birth and then

(5:37:46) for whatever reason you know the child was raised by someone else and I got him back at six or seven I would say that

(5:37:51) the experience would be very similar if I got a child that was not it's similar but it's not the same I I think it would

(5:37:57) be the same I don't think I could tell you just said that it wouldn't be the same and now you're saying it would be the same what do you mean I'm talking

(5:38:03) about um a biological child I rais from birth versus a child that I rais from

(5:38:10) the age of six it's not the biological component that makes it different it's the time in which I entered their

(5:38:16) life yeah okay so and then if they biologically were yours you would have entered their life from the beginning

(5:38:22) right but I just gave a hypothetical to where if I let's say I did give birth and then for whatever reason I was

(5:38:27) separated from that child and then that child came back at 6 or S I don't see any meaningful delineation how do you

(5:38:33) know like you can't you can't know that I I and again we can go B on anecdotes you know CU you gave anecdotes for your

(5:38:39) own like you can't know that and the thing is is like yes I agree I agree that you could love your stepchildren

(5:38:46) and should love your stepchildren right but I also understand that there is um this delineation between children

(5:38:54) are biologically yours and ones that are not I get that sure I I I would say that can also be just like a cultural um

(5:39:02) distinction be because of the culture that you've grown up with and it was so much emphasis on biologic relation that

(5:39:08) that's why you you have these different feelings so you don't think that men care to know who their offspring even

(5:39:15) are um I mean again I I think that would be based on the individual like I I know

(5:39:22) this is an anecdote but I used to joke with my ex cuz um our son was conceived on our honeymoon uh when we were in

(5:39:28) Miami that you know the father was a native to Miami um and I mean even to

(5:39:35) this day he's like it doesn't matter point that kid is mine repeat that you were on your

(5:39:41) honeymoon when our son was conceived yeah so I used to joke that the child

(5:39:46) wasn't his oh okay I see I thought you were saying the child wasn't no um and

(5:39:52) would your husband want to know I mean he says that he he says he doesn't care

(5:39:58) it's clearly is he is he your ex-husband yes oh okay yeah he probably cared he probably cared I mean it's pretty clear

(5:40:04) his son is his okay uh would you if you um I mean I'm sorry um I just want to

(5:40:12) ask this last question then you can ask whatever you want okay if it was the case that

(5:40:19) um that technology was sophisticated enough MH right that you could be

(5:40:24) pregnant right the entire time your womb could be utilized in some way I don't know whatever bizarre scientific way so

(5:40:31) like nine months yeah nine months in the womb right and you can have the child right but you were never assured

(5:40:38) paternity maternity yeah you weren't assured that so you you were just assigned a child you never knew if it

(5:40:43) was yours or not yours what you want to know um I mean it's hard to say uh again I I

(5:40:53) can kind of relate my um my social conditioning um I don't know I've

(5:41:00) considered selling my eggs so does it really would it really bother me to know that there's a child that I'm biologically related to out there not

(5:41:06) really um would I if I decide to become a parent is it necessarily A determinant

(5:41:13) that I'm biologically related no so would it be better than ultimately following this Logic for everybody who

(5:41:20) had a child to just communally put them up and they be given out to the best parents um I think in

(5:41:27) some no I I don't think it needs to be a hierarchy like that I think that uh the community can all have equal investment

(5:41:34) in children is what I'm saying yeah but this communities 300 million person community sure I mean again I'm not

(5:41:40) necessarily just uh you know when we talk about communities like obviously

(5:41:45) I'm an American but I don't have Community with people in New York you have Community with obviously your close

(5:41:51) Inner Circle and I think with like capitalism and patriarchy and kind of

(5:41:56) this idea of nuclear family it's really um hyperfocused individualism and

(5:42:02) taking it from Community which is why the nuclear family is so popular in these um prescriptions of you know Mom

(5:42:11) Dad and child it's not multigenerational it's not extended family do you think most women would

(5:42:18) care um that that's really irrelevant because I I could just say again it's because of these social purviews do you

(5:42:24) think it's because of social purviews or because women want really yeah so you think that if there if there was a

(5:42:30) different social purview women would not care to know if it was their actual off I don't think that we just have like

(5:42:35) necessarily these innate sense when it comes to preferences our brain is a is a social organ and so it responds to our

(5:42:43) environment and I think if we had maybe um you know different structures then

(5:42:50) yeah like like just we can talk about the food that you eat um obviously your

(5:42:56) preferences on food that you like are depending on your culture I mean I I

() 

(5:43:01) hate um veggie Mite where a lot of Australians like it because that's their

(5:43:07) culture and it's something that they were um you know something that they were a part of through a long line does

(5:43:14) that mean that they were born liking veggie might well I mean from an evolutionary model yes right everything

(5:43:21) everything up to the point the first Vite sandwich was made was every every fraction of

(5:43:27) evolution which led to the point that that sandwich was made so everything was selected for up until the point of that

(5:43:33) sandwich uh again I think it's just based on like you know if I were born in Australia I would have more likely than

(5:43:39) everything in Australia was selected for for the greatest amount of survival based on Evolution uh again again I I don't think

(5:43:47) you're born with these innate things like even um then what is natural selection it's

(5:43:54) like it's selecting out traits that are bad traits right sure traits for survival but traits aren't necessarily

(5:44:01) like women have children with poor Partners all the time that's true so

(5:44:07) so I mean it doesn't it's not this innate that would make evidence for innate of for for like the idea of

(5:44:15) survival like the the bad boy things like this that would actually make the case for that better for selection

(5:44:22) against modernity right so like women make poor mate selection when it comes to oh he's a big buff Chad but he's an

(5:44:29) [ __ ] right um no I I could say that my selection failed me which I I would think would be the

(5:44:35) prescriptions that you would would ass sign yeah so what okay that when you when you're talking about women making

(5:44:41) bad choices when it comes to men they're often making choices based around the fact that they think this guy's a good

(5:44:47) protector these are all things that move into that right and they're innate I don't know if I've ever evaluated a man

(5:44:53) on his ability to protect me but you wouldn't need to it's an Nate uh then no so so you're saying

(5:44:59) women who marry abusers it's their fault well I'm saying that there has to be some kind of conditionals inside of

(5:45:05) women for why they're attracted to [ __ ] jerks and they seem to be really attracted to jerks so you're saying that

(5:45:13) women innately know an abuser and what do you mean an abuser what's an abuser

(5:45:19) uh smack physically physically violent yeah yeah I don't think that they're selecting for physical violence towards

(5:45:24) them but a man who's capable of physical violence towards other men well I mean you said that women want

(5:45:31) protectors and that we can identify protectors but obviously the the

(5:45:37) that most assault women are the quote unquote protectors that's [ __ ] it's absolutely not bull why

(5:45:44) what makes them protectors if they're assaulting women well that's the role that they were supposed to like when we

(5:45:49) look at um who the protectors are it's supposed to be male family members and partners and these are the most likely

(5:45:56) people to assault women oh okay so what so how how does a woman delineate

(5:46:02) between this is a protector and an abuser they would just use whatever the phenotypical expressions were that they innately thought led to a good outcome

(5:46:10) for reproduction that would be the evolutionary view so the phenotypical expression of like he's well chiseled he

(5:46:16) looks good I just want to make sure I understand so when women get married and then experience domestic violence they

(5:46:22) knew he was an abuser before it I already told you no multiple times then

(5:46:27) then evolutionary fail it takes nothing away from my point

(5:46:33) so well no Evolution so Evolution right now would lead to modernity you agree

(5:46:39) with that right every point of selection selected out traits which did did not lead to modernity okay you agree that

(5:46:46) that's true sure okay so there could be holdover traits that women have and men

(5:46:52) have when it comes to the idea of mate selection you agree that that's true too right they just haven't been selected

(5:46:58) out of the gene pool yet um

(5:47:09) I guess we would need to like identify what these traits are just that there could be traits which are holdovers from

(5:47:17) like well 10,000 years ago because evolution is a really slow process over an a long period of time 10,000 years

(5:47:24) ago this was a really useful trait now it's not a really useful trait and it hasn't been selected out yet okay due to

(5:47:30) technology you can agree that there's probably plenty of hold over traits like that sure okay so one of them would be a

(5:47:35) phenotypical expression towards an aggressive male right this person would be capable of protecting you or capable

(5:47:41) of advanced violence things like this doesn't mean that you assume that they're going to beat you up I don't know where you keep coming up with that

(5:47:48) but uh the just the idea that based on whatever the perceived attractive phenotypical expressions are oh women

(5:47:54) like really tall men why I mean that's cross-cultural they seem to be attracted to men who are taller than them why well

(5:48:01) I think on average men are taller than women yeah but why do they want men to be taller than them

(5:48:07) I I would just say that would be gender affirming even though it's

(5:48:12) cross-cultural yeah okay so is everything is there any innate characteristics human beings have from

(5:48:20) an evolutionary standpoint I mean you you would have to establish to me what would be human nature and what so I I do

(5:48:27) think and again like are you arguing bioessentialism well from an evolutionary standpoint yeah it is it is

(5:48:33) essentialism yeah I mean even evolutionary psychology doesn't argue bioessentialism but uh bio uh biological

(5:48:40) influence what is biological essentialism essentially that behaviors and traits are predetermined no I think

(5:48:48) Evolution always argues from a sense of predeterminism has to no because you're

(5:48:54) uh like I'm sure you've heard of epigenetic effects there's also biosocial models but no even uh

(5:49:00) evolutionary psychology does not argue for bioessentialism but bio influence so what

(5:49:07) arguing what I'm arguing to you right now is that you're going to have traits which have been selected for right like

(5:49:14) hands you have hands I do have hands yes yeah were that was that selected for

(5:49:19) what do you mean was that selected natural selection right meaning this species dies this species doesn't die

(5:49:27) right through that through that uh theory of natural selection eventually we came to you have hands right that is

(5:49:34) a trait you were born with you do have sure adaptation yeah like you don't have fins I don't have fins no okay so you

(5:49:41) have hands because of all of the traits selected out that weren't your hands okay so then there there has to be some

(5:49:48) type of essentialism to that right um I mean I guess you're talking

(5:49:54) about uh like certain biological features but we're also talking about

(5:49:59) behaviors right and yeah I don't see why you wouldn't have innate traits that were geared towards survival and

(5:50:05) behavior like prove like how you would prove the nature of human

(5:50:11) behavior the nature of it m or just traits that human beings seem to be driving

(5:50:17) towards yeah how do you know that these aren't culturally driven traits that these are just Name by taking other

(5:50:23) cultures and seeing if cultures that don't have I mean obvious Hang On by taking other cultures that don't have

(5:50:30) contact with each other uh or didn't have contact with each other but we see the same types of Trends but were all

(5:50:35) those uh cultures or all those communities within the same certain time period no you can do a cross time period

(5:50:42) I mean I I don't think that that study was done through a cross I didn't say there was a study you asked how that

(5:50:47) could be done I told you I I don't think um like obviously the conditions that one Community is subjected to and a pre

(5:50:54) uh pre-industrialized uh Community is going to be different than one that is industrialized and has different

(5:51:01) resources so it's hard to say like what the nature would be without account for the environmental influence and the

(5:51:09) strategies that come along with it which is why we would take a look at different cultures over different time periods and

(5:51:14) then if we found that there was oh I don't know something that they all kind of did based on the specific sex that

(5:51:20) they had we would be able to make better determinations of things which were do you have something you're referencing

(5:51:26) yeah there's all sorts of studies on this okay I would love Yeah anthropological studies when it it comes to uh Evo psych which is now a big deal

(5:51:33) and I'm not an evolutionary guy I don't even believe in evolution but I can still make I can still make the argument

(5:51:39) from The evolutionary side of your worldview that there should be you shouldn't have any problem with the fact

(5:51:44) that human beings you tra think women are more empathetic than men no no okay

(5:51:49) never have okay let's uh let a couple chats come through just CU they're kind of piling

(5:51:55) up here okay uh two of them appear to have fallen off so I won't be able to

(5:52:01) show it on screen but I will uh read them from my computer computer cuz I can

(5:52:07) still access it that way but really quick before we do guys if you're enjoying the stream kindly like the

(5:52:13) video if you're watching on Twitch guys go to twitch.tv whatever drop us a follow in a

(5:52:18) prime sub if you have one if you have Amazon Prime you can link it to your Twitch quick for easy way to support the

(5:52:24) show every single month crazy Ace thank you for the gifted five Subs I do very much appreciate it guys like the video

(5:52:30) if you're enjoying the show also venmo cash app at whatever po if you want 100% of your contribution go to go towards us

(5:52:36) also TTS is $69 and up that'll be for the row session I'm going to let these a

(5:52:42) shoot okay that's not good all right I skipped one blus donated

(5:52:48) $70 in the words of the Blessed Virgin Mary come

(5:53:00) again thank you blaest for your uh TTS

(5:53:05) appreciate it thank you uh we have Lucas Lucas donated

(5:53:13) $100 initially I thought it was just an act that you were dimwitted illiterate and ahistorical but now I just realize

(5:53:21) that it's no act please tell me you're not a teacher I am not a

(5:53:30) teacher you you should have been insubordinate though or maybe not insubordinate but he he told you to he

(5:53:36) told you to do something and you did it that's kind of like the patriarchy a little bit you should have been like I'm not answering that I mean cuz feminism

(5:53:44) okay yeah well don't let me dictate what feminism is to you ta donated

(5:53:51) $69 men evolve to spread genes maximizing Offspring women seek

(5:53:56) long-term support to ensure child survival com balances this giving men

(5:54:02) paternity certainty and women stability for raising kids yeah it says marriage

(5:54:07) yeah not monogamy right my bad uh okay so we have thank youo tagged we got

(5:54:13) Gambit here donated $69 is she really arguing that Beast STS

(5:54:18) were more likely to be embraced by the community rather than be shamed why would a man provide resources to a child

(5:54:25) that was not biologically

(5:54:31) his that's for you I think um I mean again community uh survival you you

(5:54:38) obviously get benefits for your from your community and you would want your community to continue

(5:54:45) okay blaf donated $100 this woman has five sons and has

(5:54:51) called them all Andrew she simply tells them all apart from each other by using their surnames so as to not complicate

(5:55:00) things do you have five children I do not oh I don't know she has one okay BL

(5:55:07) blest thank you for the message I do appreciate it and we have uh two more

(5:55:12) coming in we have Christopher Murphy thank you man Christopher Murphy donated

(5:55:19) $69 I'm from Las Cruses New Mexico and I can tell you are drier than the

(5:55:29) dessert desert I think like dead pan does he mean dead pan you're dry say

(5:55:34) desert I mean if you are going to burn make sure make sure you don't make typos yeah that oh like like a cupcake he's

(5:55:41) that kind of desert dessert is dessert there's two not desert wow correct he

(5:55:47) [ __ ] up just a littleice just a little iice I've done it myself it really sucks when you have a good burn and you make a

(5:55:52) typo so here are the two that unfortunately aren't going to come up normally sometimes streamlabs bugs we

(5:55:59) have cor corny corny Peters 432 I apologize very much that it's not coming

(5:56:05) up as it normally would streamlabs bugged out you're either acting for your fans and realizing that you're getting

(5:56:11) cooked by Andrew or you're full of [ __ ] and your husband's going to divorce you after he sees this debate unless he's a

(5:56:18) s that already happened I think right we we are already divorced already divor

(5:56:24) okay all right and then Moonlight says hi Rachel and Andrew thanks for letting me know details about your you read that

(5:56:31) one oh it did okay so I might have oh I missed excuse me I missed Lucas's Lucas

(5:56:37) I apologize streamlabs got bugged men are hardwired for 100,000 years towards

(5:56:43) a subconscious revoltion against female promiscuity this is settled stock excuse

(5:56:48) me studied by Dr bus across 37 cultures stop with these social constructionist

(5:56:56) [ __ ] do you want to respond to Lucas um I mean in some of the uh

(5:57:06) sources like it does reference Dr buson again he's not arguing uh bioessentialism but just bio influence

(5:57:14) and again when when obviously he's evaluating cultures these are going to be cultures with historic record and a

(5:57:21) lot of the cultures that I'm talking about might not have written historical record but do know delineate it from

(5:57:28) from artifacts um from fossils yeah artifacts and fossils aren't going to be

(5:57:33) able to demonstrate that that how How could an artifact or fossil absent a a

(5:57:40) record I mean if you find Pottery where um like there are female figurines

(5:57:45) intermitted as as goddesses and they're pictured with multiple males that

() 

(5:57:50) doesn't prove [ __ ] with ch that literally doesn't prove anything it's just a pot that has some you have no

(5:57:57) context for it I mean I how else can we determine how Society happened without

(5:58:04) some kind of men and women working together to build society and then the limitation of knowing how specific

(5:58:11) biological functions work I think that all of that comports to exactly what he's saying when it

(5:58:18) comes to the idea of monogamy and not sharing women yeah I think um monogamy

(5:58:28) was originated um when we came back when essentially like Agriculture and

(5:58:35) property became valuable yeah I agree in modernity right well no it existed long

(5:58:40) before that by the way like in medieval Europe and due to religion and due to Judaism and due post post what post

(5:58:48) property and agriculture yeah well I thought you were I think I thought you were referencing Industrial Revolution

(5:58:53) sorry no okay just agriculture just agriculture in general yeah the domestication of animals um we don't

(5:59:00) even know when that happened I mean it it again it depends on what culture but

(5:59:05) you yeah that that's roughly about 8,000 we don't know that we don't know when agriculture happened like we just

(5:59:13) talking about the ability of humanity to grow a plant um I mean to create crops like

(5:59:20) obviously there's a difference between hunter gatherer societies and excuse me moving to agriculture yeah but animal

(5:59:25) husbandry could be you know 50,000 years old we have no idea how old animal husbandry is uh we we do have theory on

(5:59:33) it Theory yeah it's exactly what it is is Theory yeah gravity is Theory no

(5:59:39) that's different so there's a force effect we can at least see that we call gravity that's not theoretical right but

(5:59:45) right but you still can't see gravity yeah right but we can't really make the determination of animal husbandry we can

(5:59:52) make the determination of modern animal husbandry like when that became a a

(5:59:57) mainstream may stay based on literature but I mean we don't we don't really know we don't really know when like people

(6:00:03) started growing plants how would you even determine that um I mean I don't know the

(6:00:09) methodological like process of how we would determine that but there um obviously are like Pine and and nyine

(6:00:15) epochs where where we have evidence on what is occurring within that within that time period yeah but I mean it's

(6:00:24) not so like this guy he points out he says every culture which is studied

(6:00:29) cross culturally which is what I came up with on the fly right just to to demonstrate how you could demonstrate

(6:00:35) this but he said the same thing what cultures he's like there's 37 different cultures that we looked at men are

(6:00:40) hardwired yeah but again to spread their genes and women the methodology is it during a certain time period he said it

(6:00:47) it was across multiple time periods I don't think he said that and multiple cultures I think he just said multiple cultures I don't think he mentioned

(6:00:53) anything about time perod didn't you say that this guy Dr bus is that his name I don't know who he is right but didn't you just I think it's Dr David bus yeah

(6:00:59) didn't you just get done saying that he's referenced in a lot of these early anthropological studies no he's he's

(6:01:04) referenced in evolution psychology oh evolutionary psychology okay so anthrop anthropological studies you think

(6:01:11) actually demonstrate to you that men were not hardwired to spread their genes um not through like the mechanism

(6:01:17) of monogamy no I didn't say through monogamy just wired to spread their

(6:01:23) genes um I mean I I think primates are

(6:01:28) like engag in sex sure so men are wired to spread their genes and in in primate

(6:01:34) culture what do women do do you thinken women don't like have a desire to have sex no I do but his point was to say

(6:01:40) that women select for a single man so they want a single man there for

(6:01:47) the purpose of protection and things like this not men women well again Community can offer you protection

(6:01:53) that's not what he's saying claiming the study say well I mean if you want to talk about the study we can yeah I mean

(6:01:59) I'd like it linked at least okay but yeah I I've never heard of such a thing

(6:02:05) I don't think that there are societies filled to the brim with uh women goddesses who are basically having sex

(6:02:12) with uh who whatever man they wanted to like that wasn't the case okay yeah I

(6:02:18) don't think it was the case basically anymore from from my reading there were

(6:02:24) um just before there was written history right I mean there there is some evidence but uh of like female goddesses

(6:02:32) prior to to patriarchal ones and that they essentially rep uh represented the good mother uh fertility sexuality and

(6:02:41) War yeah okay but we're not talking about that about goddesses we're talking

(6:02:47) about women having big sex festivals where the men aren't interested in the paternity because they want to share

(6:02:53) based on the community um well yeah like again I I don't know why it's so

(6:03:00) farfetched to say that there were civilizations um that you you know

(6:03:06) thought that didn't understand the contributions um that men had towards uh

(6:03:12) reproduction or that didn't understand that just even a single encounter could lead to

(6:03:18) pregnancy uh I I would even say from yeah that has nothing to do even if they didn't understand the mechanism even a

(6:03:25) lot of seen would create the the maximum outcome of pregnancy and so multiple men

(6:03:31) would be invested in in fulfilling that need you think the ancient world didn't didn't know that that the penis going in

(6:03:38) the vagina led to a child because that's a his obviously think there's a certain

(6:03:45) um yeah I mean I I think there are s certain civilizations um not the major

(6:03:50) ones major civilizations knew it at least the ones we got record of okay well I mean if you have some kind of

(6:03:56) evidence that talks about uh prehistoric cultures I'd love to see it well okay

(6:04:03) again the major cultures we have evidence of I'm happy to give you my sources you can give me your sources I

(6:04:09) think we're kind of beating a dead horse okay well I mean I just don't understand I have prehistorical non-written sources

(6:04:16) that demonstrate that men didn't know this but in the written record they did know this it's really weird to me it's

(6:04:23) just like conjecture all right uh so here's what we're going to do there's like one or

(6:04:28) two other super quick things we're going to do I'm going to let some chats come through and Lucas donated 69

(6:04:36) I literally told you that the 37 culture study included secluded tribes in the Amazon and papular New Guinea and before

() 

(6:04:44) you dismiss Dr bus know that he is the most by far cited scientist in this

(6:04:51) area response or I don't have anything okay uh thank you Lucas for the message

(6:04:57) I apologize that your message from like an hour ISO uh fell off we have

(6:05:03) blaest blaest donated $70 Andrew just because you can't

(6:05:09) actually see her point doesn't mean she might not theoretically have won that's true she might theoretically have one

(6:05:16) just cuz I can't see it all right we have uh Lucas again coming in blaest really

(6:05:24) good to see you man thank you so much for your streamlabs message if you guys want to get one in streamlabs.com Lucas

(6:05:30) donated $69 yes Dopey do his multiple studies included an access for mating

(6:05:36) preferences across /ht do your damn homework before you perpetually keep

(6:05:42) spouting off that you disagree you've lost anyy

(6:05:48) credibility I I don't have anything okay uh I I do have a quick question for you we won't Linger on it for too long I I

(6:05:55) think anyways uh would you rather cross paths with a bear a random men or random

(6:06:02) bear in the woods um I mean I live in Montana so I have

(6:06:09) come across Paths of um with with bears h i i I think it

() 

(6:06:16) would be context dependent for me I would be really nervous being alone with a man well here's here how about this

(6:06:22) context so you randomly spawn in the woods and then you have two buttons that

(6:06:27) also randomly spawn you can press the one that spawns a random men or you press the one that spawns a random bear

(6:06:34) it would be a random adult man from the United States or a random adult

(6:06:39) bear uh of any bear species in the United States okay bear bear

(6:06:46) okay Okay uh there is a follow-up question from double agent agent donated

(6:06:53) $20 agent question for the feminist would you rather be alone in the woods with a man or in alone in a public

(6:07:00) bathroom with a mentally ill man pretending to be a woman I assume there they're asking me

(6:07:06) if I would rather be alone with a CIS man or a transwoman uh alone in the woods with a

(6:07:13) man or alone in a public bathroom with a trans woman is that what they're asking

(6:07:20) I believe that's what they're asking yes oh I'd rather be in the bathroom with the transom okay we have two here Edwin

(6:07:30) braer donated $269 I've watching this whole debate and

(6:07:36) I never heard her stance on anything it always changes and just depends on

(6:07:41) something she never argued anything and stuck with it classic Andrew W love you

(6:07:47) it's true it's like a tu of toothpaste squeeze here it moves there squeeze there it moves here I mean I do think morality can be very context dependent

(6:07:54) like we've talked about in like the aspects of killing like is killing wrong obviously there's going to be instances

(6:07:59) where it's Justified and not justified by the way guys we did lower the TTS it's a $20 TTS we'll do the row

(6:08:06) session now we'll do a row session and then we'll get this all wrapped up we have 51st state 51st state donated

(6:08:14) $20 I'm just happy to see a Canadian stand up for Traditional Values good on

(6:08:20) you Andrew now I do um you heard that from the same place you heard I didn't have

(6:08:25) any biological kids Andrew for you're going to be on I think both of you actually are going to

(6:08:31) be on our dating talk panel tomorrow yeah I'll be here you'll be here yeah uh

(6:08:37) Andrew if somebody donates an ethereum one eth I'm not eating a [ __ ] P will

(6:08:43) you eat a slice of pineapple pineapple ever I hate it what what about a singular slice of pineapple it doesn't

(6:08:50) have to be pineapple pizza dude are you upset your consent isn't being respected so gross you know no you know Andrew no

(6:08:57) doesn't always mean no what look it's a

(6:09:03) negotiation it's I'm not forcing I'm not forcing him I'm

(6:09:08) just like negotiating the the terms coring negotiating how much is an

(6:11:55) there is a meta analysis that discusses samesex relationships have uh equal or

(6:15:56) shows uh Tuesday so I mean pretty much couple reasons couple reasons uh

(6:16:04) primarily just in terms of the longevity longevity is that the word I thought you

(6:16:10) did offer Tuesdays yes well I thought I mispronounced it longevity I don't know uh if I were

(6:16:18) to continue doing two shows a week of the dating talk I'd probably this would be the last year of doing the show and

(6:16:24) then I'd be done with it uh I think I can continue the show indefinitely if I do it just once a week so I know uh I

(6:16:32) know some of you looked forward to the two shows a week but I just thought hey you know one show week's a little more

(6:16:38) uh feasible so that's why the decision was made not to rule out that it couldn't we could return to doing

(6:16:45) Tuesday uh Tuesday shows two shows a week too but you're going to eat it pour them in oh wait what pour him in pour

(6:27:45) this conversation less boring go ahead I'm waiting how often do you think about the Roman Empire Brian that is that your

(6:27:51) best effort sure in any case you're not particularly adding to the conversation you've been disrespectful this entire

(6:27:56) time you're entitled you're rude you have Tik Tok brain you cannot stay focused we've only been live for an hour

(6:28:02) and a half or so I'm going to ask you to leave okay so get up get the [ __ ]

(6:28:07) out ass podcast [ __ ] you [ __ ] do only fans you [ __ ] degenerate as if

(6:28:13) hello and welcome to my series as if your feminist companion product to the whatever podcast as someone who has been

(6:28:20) debating feminism on Tik Tok for two years now I can see there's a very unique setup when it comes to men

(6:28:27) holding spaces centered around anti-feminist red pill incel or heavily

(6:28:33) religious them there are many men who hold these spaces so that they can have access to Abus

(6:28:39) women I think we can all agree on the setup the whatever podcast employees they'll have the host some red pillars

(6:28:45) maybe some conservative Talking Heads and then maybe some religious figures and these are all against of and

(6:28:51) Instagram models the only time they have women outside of that context is if they're conservative like Candace Owens

(6:28:57) or lla Rose and obviously they have the structure because their arguments will go unchallenged or be poorly challenged

(6:29:04) and I'm not saying Instagram or of models aren't competent smart people if you don't have the experience if you

(6:29:10) don't know the arguments and if you don't have the information you're just not going to do well the only exception

(6:29:16) they have to this rule is Farid and our girl brings a smoke honestly don't care

(6:29:21) about the context of the video that I'm stitching because Brian's statements made it irrelevant he actually made a

(6:29:27) moral Claim by saying because she's an O model she's a degenerate did I say that of abuse is no I said degenerate I

(6:29:33) didn't say because she's an oh yeah that's true he just said you [ __ ] degenerate that

(6:29:40) implies Instagram model or a sex worker these men consider you to be on the Bottom Rung of the social hierarchy

(6:29:47) however if you're on this podcast it's obvious to see that you've actually claimed some level of notoriety or

(6:29:53) economic success and within the red pillar there is a special type of anger

(6:29:58) because not only do they view themselves as the oppressed gender but now they see what they View is the most degenerate

(6:30:05) social class of women even achieving High economic success which obviously they think is undeserving and I think

(6:30:12) why so many men are interested in this content is because it not only allows them to cosplay masculinity but

(6:30:18) essentially to correct an injustice within their own mind and I think traditional masculinity is very much

(6:30:23) centered around male Supremacy so they've manufactured this system where it's very unlikely that they are going

(6:30:29) to lose as a way to prop up a facade of intellectual super ority and on top of

(6:30:35) that they get to humiliate and degrade the undeserving privileged class of women in a way they view that is very

(6:30:41) Justified and as someone who has been in spaces like this with men like this not

(6:30:47) only do they justify the behavior the biggest red flag is that they enjoy

(6:30:54) it okay um there a couple questions there sure I I think I stepped away when

(6:31:00) you specifically referenced this term abuse yeah so the clip that which and by

(6:31:06) the way you said you didn't care about the context at all so context doesn't matter to you um so she could have just

(6:31:13) like stabbed a family member and I call her degenerate and I'm in the wrong uh when I was referencing the system of

(6:31:20) abuse I wasn't talking about that specific instance but how the podcast is structured you were reacting to the clip

(6:31:28) and sayri of the no of the overall strategy that the that the

(6:31:34) podcast employs sure so that clip in specific is not abusive or abuse uh no I

(6:31:41) wasn't referencing that clip as abusive the specific aspect what what is abusive about the show I when we talk about when

(6:31:49) men hold red pillar spaces is this a red pill space red pill incel manosphere which

(6:31:56) one of okay which one of those am I um I I would say red pill what how how do you define red pill

(6:32:03) uh that women are the privileged gender in society that's red pill that's what red pill philosophy is is that women are

(6:32:09) the privileged gender women are the privileged gender right yeah I'll grant

(6:32:14) that I would dispute that though that that women are the privileged gender or that's what red pill is what would you

(6:32:21) consider red pill red pill is just a series of descriptors that are trying to identify the distinction between the way

(6:32:28) women and men act um so so what is abusive about the

(6:32:36) show um I think uh when you have a panel

(6:32:42) to discuss certain issues and then um kind of try to humiliate them based on

(6:32:48) their career choices or based on certain aspects of moral prescriptions that that

(6:32:55) is is a form of uh harm abuse is is anytime you disagree with

(6:33:02) somebody is that always you humiliating them no so what would be like an example of humiliation I mean I think calling

(6:33:11) um uh essentially when you have these spaces to discuss certain aspects and then um

(6:33:22) essentially categorize someone as um a degenerate

(6:33:27) um said didn't have a problem with the clip I I mean that specific SP I I think

(6:33:33) misogyny is a form of abuse and so when you're holding a space to be misogynistic and experience hostility

(6:33:42) um towards women that that that is the main purpose of it can we Define misogyny first yeah uh misogyny is the

(6:33:51) uh hostility towards women and girls for stepping outside of their patriarchal prescribed

(6:33:56) gender so what if they don't step out of their patriarchal prescribed structure

(6:34:02) but you just hate Wom women but they're like falling into the patriarchal uh expectation of women but

(6:34:09) you still hate women that would not be misog I think it would be hard to quantify like how someone hates women I

(6:34:16) hate women I saying I hate do you have to hate all women um let's say they

(6:34:21) do wait I have a question for you what if like a leftist male hated like

(6:34:27) conservative women who were Pik mes and who were like adhering to patriarchal expectations of women would that be

() 

(6:34:34) misogyny um no the only exception I would give if is if they W wish them

(6:34:40) aspects of patriarchal violence so if like a leftist Creator what is wait what is patriarchal violence um like rape

(6:34:48) grape That Couldn't occur under a matriarchy well that could also occur between two women yeah couldn't um well

(6:34:54) grape is a a form of men to assert domination over women unless it's women

(6:35:00) doing it to women right but we I'm sure we we both agree that that rape is a gender based crime let's try to use grae

(6:35:06) sorry rape is a gender based crime no I don't agree that that's a gender based crime um I mean we we even discussed

(6:35:12) earlier like within the military that women are going to be more likely to experience grape right yeah but that's a

(6:35:18) different claim than it's gender based gender based means it affects like pregnancy is gender

(6:35:24) based that's a gender based thing that would be a gender based claim cuz women and girls are more disproportionately

(6:35:30) likely to experience it that's literally the definition of it when you say gender based it just means more

(6:35:36) of um essentially it happens to someone because they are a specific gender or it disproportionately happens to a specific

(6:35:43) gender okay so by that definition uh yeah I'll say that well no actually I

(6:35:49) won't even grant that so even by that definition no I don't I don't want to delineate because I do want to go soon

(6:35:56) so I just want to I am keeping it focused I just wanted to clarify I do think if a leftist Creator wish grape

(6:36:03) Upon a conservative woman that would count as a misogyny because it is a form of patal gased violence okay so misogyny

(6:36:12) is not just hatred of women there's other qualifiers I I think the hatred of women

(6:36:18) is just a not really a good working definition because it centers the perspective of the person rather than

(6:36:25) centers the experience of women and girls and then I think we need to see that it also acts as a policing Force to

(6:36:33) police women and girls Behavior to conform to a specific gender prescription okay so we're using a lot

(6:36:39) of buzzwords here we're talking about oppression abuse humiliation uh degrading these are things that you

(6:36:46) allege uh I do or Andrew does in general is is a misogynistic

(6:36:52) space yeah it's a misogynist okay so what is an example of uh something done

(6:36:58) or said that was misogynistic on this podcast I mean I I I mean what do you want me to pull up tap and point to it

(6:37:05) just I mean just one thing um I mean do do would you say that

(6:37:10) originally you did have uh like o girls and and Instagram

(6:37:15) models what do you mean originally I mean I don't know if that's your guidelines now but guidelines I mean so

(6:37:22) or who you're looking for as um dating show you know a part of your show like

(6:37:28) hold on are you saying you can only be misogynistic towards of girls no not at all so I

(6:37:35) specific demographic when you're having guests on how would that pertain to misogyny when a woman who doesn't do can

(6:37:41) be victim of misogyny why does it right because obviously o and women who engage

(6:37:47) in sex work under patriarchy seen as undesirable so having that specific clientele is meant to shame and

(6:37:54) humiliate them for for being on o or so on and so yeah so I'll answer the question of all the guests we've ever

(6:38:00) had the representation of women who do o it's about 15% so some shows there's

(6:38:06) more some shows there's there's none uh and we still do have of girls who come on the show uh I think it's actually

(6:38:13) decreased a little bit there was perhaps a period where the representation of of models on the show models uh was higher

(6:38:22) but now it's maybe a bit lower but they still come on the show and then we have normal girls who come on the show we

(6:38:27) have women in college we have women who are professionals women in the hair excuse me Healthcare field so we have

(6:38:34) all kinds of different women who come on the show um I don't think you've really answered my question

(6:38:39) though what did I not answer so you were asking me well what are the kinds of women you bring on the show I've just

(6:38:46) answer for specific demographics and I do think how is the show misogynistic can you give me one example

(6:38:52) well that is one example simply by virtue of bringing only fan some only fans girl on the show I'm meant to

(6:38:59) essentially shame and and demonize sex work and saying that you know you're a degenerate you're a low class because

(6:39:05) this is how you engage I categorically reject your uh

(6:39:13) presumption there that that's the reason we bring them on the show to humiliate or degrade them okay so your premises

(6:39:22) flawed what Brian doesn't he doesn't actually think that they're necessarily

(6:39:27) degenerates or things like that because they do sex work that's me I mean I think it was definitely

(6:39:33) implied by his statement which statement you degenerate you do o yeah but I mean they were tra they were trading insults

(6:39:40) right like you don't always mean what you say when you're training insults to say just kidding is kind of my point

(6:39:46) well I mean here's the other I mean there's this is why context matters uh

(6:39:52) the girl was uh I suppose there were other factors that led me to make

(6:39:59) perhaps assumptions about that specific girl uh she appeared to have possibly

(6:40:05) been on some kind of drugs possibly blasted in you know

(6:40:11) tattoos um had a weirdo I I don't know if this pertains to her being a

(6:40:16) degenerate had a weirdo boyfriend who was like acting really weird probably doesn't pertain to degeneracy really but

(6:40:23) uh yeah well that that was the specific context that you gave yeah so she had just gotten done trolling the show she

(6:40:31) came on in bad faith she wasn't paying attention she was being rude to me I was extremely patient with her I'd reached a

(6:40:38) point in the show where I was like hey I'm not dealing with this girl anymore I gave her plenty of chances she

(6:40:44) intentionally came on in bad faith and to troll the show I was in the process of kicking her off as I kicked her off

(6:40:51) in a bit of an abrasive way although I think it was warranted uh she says something along the lines of good luck

(6:40:56) with your dead ass podcast bro and then that's when I say dead ass podcast who who the hell the implication who the

(6:41:03) hell are you you do only fans you [ __ ] degenerate so I think in the situation where somebody has been

(6:41:10) insulting towards you you might have you might just be like look just take it on the chin you just you know don't sink

(6:41:16) down to their level sometimes you're going to feel compelled to insult somebody back when they've just insulted

(6:41:23) you so I think context does matter perhaps you think it doesn't I mean sure if you would have been like you know

(6:41:29) said something different like great you know [ __ ] off [ __ ] have a great day [ __ ] off idiot yeah you know something

(6:41:35) like that to well the degenerate was attached to the only fans um label and

(6:41:43) so it's not her behavior towards you it's not her regression it's just um it's just the fact that she's an only

(6:41:48) fans model that makes her a degenerate I mean isn't the basis of like insulting somebody like you might the isn't

(6:41:55) insulting somebody the idea there is and I try to avoid it as much as I can the

(6:42:00) idea is to put in a dig that hurts them like that's the point of an insult it's

(6:42:06) to say something that will be hurtful to them and so I could like couldn't you make say the same thing about like if

(6:42:12) you were to make a commentary about somebody's physical appearance like often times that's how people will

(6:42:17) insult somebody is by saying something about their physical appearance okay okay I I'm sorry is is there a question

(6:42:24) yeah so it's like you're saying I'm making some sort of like moral I I don't

(6:42:30) understand your objection the fact that she's an only fan model is what makes her a degenerate not her behavior

(6:42:35) towards you yeah it's a component not her trolling not anything else just this only one component yeah I mean I could

(6:42:41) have used all kinds of other words I could have called her a [ __ ] I could have called her a prostitute I could

(6:42:46) have used all other kinds of words I think degenerate was actually a pretty

(6:42:52) it's not the word that necessarily that you're using it's in what the label is applied if you would have been like oh

(6:42:58) you you're on drugs you you [ __ ] degenerate then I would have said like oh he's calling her a degenerate cuz

(6:43:03) she's a drug user but you said you're a degenerate you're an only fans model so in What scenario can one call somebody a

(6:43:11) degenerate like what if there's evidence of them being a degenerate I mean I don't think being a sex worker innately

(6:43:18) makes you a deer what makes somebody a degenerate from her view nothing I mean

(6:43:23) I guess I don't know do you want me to look up what degenerate means without morals without morals if the insult is

(6:43:30) originating from me would why were you hold on hold on if the insult originates

(6:43:35) from me wouldn't it be my world view that would

(6:43:41) instruct the insult that I opt to use in the situation like I I get that you

(6:43:47) don't think that like letting 10 dudes bang you in a day is degenerate but like maybe I do so like wouldn't it just be

(6:43:54) my preference to say yeah she's a [ __ ] Degen are you agreeing that sex workers are

(6:44:00) degenerates um I suppose it would depends you'd have to you'd have to give me like what does she do because sex

(6:44:07) work is this nebulous term that is like it can mean any anywhere from a woman who is a hold on hold on let me finish

(6:44:16) uh a woman who's a prostitute who sleeps with 10 different men a day to a woman who takes lingerie photos so are all sex

(6:44:24) workers degenerates I don't know maybe maybe not Andrew might say yes they're all of them

(6:44:31) are degenerates I'm sure he would I might say like a woman who takes like linger like who's who's like in like

(6:44:38) traditional calendar lingerie model is she a degenerate what does her being an

(6:44:44) only fans model have to do with you calling her a degenerate uh well I I didn't have a great opportunity to to

(6:44:50) review her only fans work but like I looked at her Twitter beforehand and I've luckily it hasn't been burned into

(6:44:57) the back of my retina but there were some degenerate things for example on her Twitter she was sticking certain

(6:45:04) objects that I don't think belong in certain holes it honestly doesn't matter anyway it doesn't because the point is

(6:45:10) the point is just to say that he can think that she's a degenerate and probably does think she's a degenerate

(6:45:17) probably thinks sex work is degenerate but that doesn't prove that he brought her on the show to shame her for being a degenerate that's the problem that's the

(6:45:24) whole problem with I mean I I would think that um if you do have this common demographic um within your panel and

(6:45:32) when you know there is conflict that arises that that's what you highlight in terms of oh you're just this you

(6:45:37) degenerate that that can be a reasonable strategy even if it's only 15% I mean

(6:45:43) didn't you have this debate with RC that this is his issue with the whatever podcast is that it

(6:45:49) features uh sex work models yeah and his channel does too so the thing right so

(6:45:54) then if we agree that you do feature sex workor models and and only and only fans that that is a common demographic that

(6:46:01) comes on your panel um it doesn't mean it's coming on for the purpose of you of you doing anything

(6:46:08) to them because or to start a conflict where you call them a degenerate well I mean in that aspect it did and that was

(6:46:15) uh the context behind the insult you know again it wasn't any other behavior that doesn't show only fans that doesn't

(6:46:22) show the purpose of them coming on though is for that to happen that's the problem you have like you can say Brian

(6:46:29) you think they're a degenerate and I'm susing out that your motivation is that you only bring these degenerates on so

(6:46:34) that you can call them degenerates okay that's fair but it does even show hate and hostility towards them yeah but that

(6:46:40) that doesn't actually prove the intent that he was bringing these women on is so that he can somehow do something bad

(6:46:46) to I mean I I don't have like a computer with all Clips where I can give you examples even if you did though like

(6:46:52) let's say you had let's say 50 or [ __ ] let's say 75% you got in a fight with 75% of them

(6:47:00) and called 75% of them when you got pissed at them de that still wouldn't prove that you

(6:47:05) brought them on specifically to call them degenerates like that doesn't follow obviously this is one example but

(6:47:12) if I had clips of other examples of showing hate or hostility especially within these

(6:47:17) contexts um isn't hostility just like they don't like it or it doesn't make

(6:47:23) them feel good and they would feel hostility like if a woman feels hostility can be aggression it can be

(6:47:29) change in tone it can be yelling it can be um talking over people it can be uh

(6:47:36) steamrolling I mean it can be a multitude of things yeah so um really

(6:47:42) what's interesting to me though if we've had I think I don't recall the exact numbers uh but I think I said it was

(6:47:49) like 15% of all the panelists have been have done the of I think that puts the

(6:47:54) number at like 150 to maybe 200 of girls have been on the show uh I think I've

(6:48:01) maybe call I that might be the only girl of the perhaps 200 o models who we've

(6:48:07) had on the show who I've called degenerate so you're saying this one inst off the

(6:48:14) street uh no what do you mean the majority wait wait hold on the majority

(6:48:19) of our guests are pre-booked and they have typically weeks or months to

(6:48:25) prepare to come on the show we don't make we don't just try to get people out

(6:48:31) like the people reach out to us predominantly of all the guests that have that we have on reach out to us to

(6:48:37) be on the show sure so when when you are getting people on the show um who are

(6:48:44) the male counterparts what do you mean uh like Chase um Justin Waller who how long what

(6:48:52) they Justin Waller was like on the show a year and a half ago or something I mean how old is that video it's mostly

(6:48:57) just three people he wasn't even in that video it would be no I mean how as my video a year and a half

(6:49:04) so it can be around that time as well yeah so you're looking at so came on the show two times right so

(6:49:12) why are there women that are off the street just kind of random women whether they're College whether they're o

(6:49:17) whether they're Instagram models but when it comes to the mail pan panelist they're they're hand

(6:49:22) selected you know they just aren't random col how does that pertain at all because when you're

(6:49:30) having these subject matter experts within certain aspects obviously like Andrew he's had a lot of experience when

(6:49:35) it comes Andrew is not a subject matter expert on dating like not at all he's he

(6:49:42) doesn't study do have subject matter expertise right which I mean he's married but I don't know if that makes

(6:49:48) dating I don't if that makes he's been in fact I've been out of the dating market for like half my life you you've

(6:49:54) been married for what 20 or like I've been with Rachel for Andrew wasn't even dating when they

(6:50:00) were dating again like I I don't know what want me to do when I can't reference like specific clips that I

(6:50:05) don't have well you can't well so okay I mean I explain things and you're like that was a year and a half ago thiser is

(6:50:11) not a sub what is he a subject matter expert of um I mean like capitalism and economic

(6:50:18) success he's not a subject expert yeah that's not a subject matter expert so he's just a random guy are you a subject

(6:50:25) matter expert and in Marxism no how come I wouldn't say that how come you're not

(6:50:31) what makes you not that um I definitely think that's what my B my platform is based on so I would say

(6:50:37) more of a subject matter expert than like the average person sure well then that's all Waller would be right so why

(6:50:43) did Waller come on because he wanted to probably engage with these various

(6:50:49) individuals about their various worldviews the same reason that most people so he he's a random guy just like the women are random why do you take

(6:50:55) random callers I mean all my callers are random well I don't understand if all your callers are random is it because you

(6:51:01) just want to humiliate people people weren't subject matter experts like yourself oh uh no oh no you have

(6:51:07) different motivations than that that's really weird I mean it it really like you're not random are you no this is

(6:51:13) actually hildon Andrew we've talked about this before this is actually a fantastic argument this is a criticism

(6:51:18) hold on well this is a this is a criticism he he kicks people off too you

(6:51:24) kick people off he tells people to be quiet you mute him like well this isn't this is a criticism like and I think

(6:51:30) maybe Dean and Parker have forwarded like oh why do you you bring on these

(6:51:36) these huh you said de and Parker forwarded this no no no they like put the argument forward yeah they they

(6:51:42) forward this oh man the what why do you want to bring on these girls who are just ill prepared and d d da you host if

(6:51:50) I'm correct you host Tik Tock lives correct yeah so that's like for and

(6:51:56) secondly thirdly I don't even know where we're at firstly that's just random people scrolling on their phone I

(6:52:03) suspect the IQ of people on Tik to Tik Tok no offense is probably low lower

(6:52:08) than the IQ of our average guest like look Tik tok's like so basically what you have you have a guy who's never seen

(6:52:14) your content before okay and you put in these prompts and Andrew called you out

(6:52:19) uh on this during the show you forward these positions I don't know if if it's

(6:52:25) um bait mod and Bailey but you you're like oh abortion should be legal for the

(6:52:30) entire term and then you're going to like capture these people are like wo so she's okay with people who want to get

(6:52:36) an abortion like 5 minutes before gives it completely proi you totally like change your position but so these hold

(6:52:43) on hold on hold on so these people that you and you do how often do you do the Tik Tok debates multiple times a week it

(6:52:50) depends okay so you do Tik Tok debates these people are going in 100% blind

(6:52:55) they're just on their phone scrolling they happen to happen on your Tik Tok live through the algorithm they're like

(6:53:01) oh let me do a Quest and it's some like completely unprepared person who probably like never debates or he just

(6:53:08) has like vague uh you know political beliefs and maybe voted for Trump and he's like some grandpa or some [ __ ] and

(6:53:16) you've like have you have all your information you have everything and

(6:53:22) instantly they get thrown in all the girls who come on our show have weeks or months to prepare they often ask to be

(6:53:30) on the show they they have opportunity to to uh practice their debate skills they have opportunity to review for

(6:53:38) weeks or months past episodes so how are you saying that I'm somehow you know

(6:53:43) doing this unfair thing with my platform where they have to come in studio and

(6:53:49) they have an abundance of time to prepare whereas you're just like you're

(6:53:54) just picking people who are popping up in the algorithm sure they have way less

(6:54:00) of the people you engage with have far L time to prepare and less debate experience not subject matter experts

(6:54:06) and you have proprietary definitions for everything you put up there like abortion in fact almost every definition

(6:54:11) you have for everything we've discussed today which why we spent more time on semantics and defining things anything else is because every definition you

(6:54:18) gave is proprietary none of them are like like your definition of feminism

(6:54:23) proprietary misogyny proprietary well just everything is a proprietary definition well my my definition of

(6:54:30) feminism is from Bell hooks my definition of misogyny is from K man so

(6:54:35) obviously but these are not these are not the definitions which you'd find in the Commons like misogyny would just be

(6:54:42) uh right the dictionary is descriptive not prescriptive so obviously I'm not making descriptive definitions

(6:54:48) proprietary they're proprietary well yeah like how how do you define fascism

(6:54:53) I'm sure that um a lot of political Scholars have different definitions of fascism because they're talking about

(6:54:59) how they're trying to convey the subject but when you're talking about abortion people think termination of the so if I

(6:55:05) can finish um when it comes to the abortion topic I've run a different

(6:55:11) variety of backgrounds which I'm sure you've seen legal without restriction abortion legal and free all 9 months now

(6:55:18) I won pro-abortion because there were aspects of the prompt that I was sick of

(6:55:23) explaining so um one of the aspects of Tik Tok is is just finding good prompts

(6:55:29) to uh communicate what you're what your position is effectively yeah but the second I don't use the abortion free and

(6:55:37) legal 9 months any but you say abortion is the liberation of a pregnancy when you say that I never said that

(6:55:43) deliberate termination sorry 9 month yeah yeah

(6:55:49) sorry deliberate termination of a pregnancy yes so the thing is is like that is super proprietary when people

(6:55:55) are thinking you like me to use the medical definition from Harvard when people are thinking of abortion right

(6:56:01) they're thinking that you're saying it's okay to terminate the baby up to 9 months that's what they're thinking sure I I don't discount that which is why

(6:56:08) when they come up and you know we discuss that I'm not like oh you [ __ ] idiot like haahahaha oh right but I'm

(6:56:14) just saying I tell them this is how well and I've told you that I have change my prompt because there are certain heavy

(6:56:21) lifting things that I don't want to do like there's conversations I want to have and I don't want to spend my time

(6:56:27) um correcting certain assumptions so I I have changed my background I don't use that anymore okay um here we'll come

(6:56:34) right back to it I just want let's wrap up hold on hold on we're almost done I just want to just want to say I'm ready

(6:56:40) to go okay hold on I need to let a couple come through though before they fall off if Andrew

(7:00:05) even think I don't know if we saw grid one or cheeks tonight but uh they're definitely regular patrons um one

(7:00:12) question for you do you think like defra do you think defrauding people is degenerate um how are we defining

(7:00:19) degenerate without morals is it immoral I mean to defraud

(7:00:26) people in in what like just fraud in any context fraud fraud

(7:00:32) is that wrong um well I mean fraud is wrong sure

(7:00:37) okay like the majority of the majority of only fans creators are employing something called typers and Chatters so

(7:00:44) they're representing to uh their predominantly male Audience by the way this is me typing this is me chatting

(7:00:51) with you this is a representation there's this term in uh in marketing or in the legal World false advertising

(7:00:58) these women are false advertising they're saying uh essentially purchase this product and you get to talk to me

() 

(7:01:04) spend this money you get to talk to me in the reality they're employing either a management company or they have like a

(7:01:10) typer typically in like a third world country uh you know it's typically a man who's going to be typing on behalf of

(7:01:16) the woman and sexting with these men I think if you're representing and you're saying hey I'm uh I'm the one who you're

(7:01:23) going to be talking to they are making a representation a false representation that's fraud Point Blank

(7:01:30) period they're def Fring I think it's uh civil fraud and criminal fraud they are

(7:01:36) defrauding the and if they're not doing it then it wouldn't technically be fraud but the majority of these women have a

(7:01:41) management company they have typers they have Chatters they have somebody else typically a man sending messages and

(7:01:47) they're saying it's me but it's actually not that's fraud that's

(7:01:57) degenerate I mean uh sh that that's definitely an aspect of capitalism that

(7:02:03) I would agree with WR do you think it's wrong oh okay you do think it's wrong yeah I don't think there's a lot of ethical consumption under capitalism

(7:02:09) okay but you just you just granted that so when we fraud would be degenerate so

(7:02:15) I think I was justified then to call her degenerate well I I again just because she's like is she engaging in this

(7:02:20) specific practice of saying like pay me and I'll chat with you I again like I I

(7:02:26) think you're really being dis dishonest how would it be demonizing about you demiz work you're trying to massage it

(7:02:33) to make it seem that you were demonizing other aspects rather than actually demonizing sex work this actually my

(7:02:39) goto my my go to hold on hold hold on you're not going to dictate what my own position is kind of steamrolling me I'm

(7:02:46) not steamrolling you let me respond to you no I've been quite I've been moderate I've been quite the whole show

(7:02:51) you guys have been talking a lot at least allow me to respond to that so this idea that this is like some sort

(7:02:58) of I'm I'm now forwarding this position about these women defrauding men like

(7:03:03) that I'm trying to massage it yeah you're trying to massage your St hold on and what you were referencing actually I

(7:03:09) mean Andrew can can vouch for me on this when I have criticisms of only fans it's

(7:03:16) never like oh you post naked photos you're doing porn porn bad I typically

(7:03:21) defer to this precise argument of you haven't given a position I defer to this

(7:03:27) position of you are you are defrauding these men by having typers Chatters and

(7:03:33) doing false rep misrepresentation is that not the case Andrew whenever I'm not like oh they're

(7:03:39) they're they're a moralc because they're posting nude photos no it's like actually I actually have not heard that

(7:03:45) no that well I haven't heard Brian demonized women because they do sex work

(7:03:50) because they post like nude photos it's it's like my attack on it tends to be that's usually me that's Andrew that's

(7:03:57) me I me I don't know how you can say that's not the the statement that you said you're a degenerate you do o You're

(7:04:04) a degenerate but if the majority of O creators are engaged in defrauding Their audience and you granted that fraud if

(7:04:11) you would have said is degenerate you are you would have to agree with are defrauding your off audience you degenerate then I would probably give

(7:04:17) you more leeway why do I need to add that qualifier because saying you're trying to massage the context to make it

(7:04:24) seem to fit a different if within my own worldview and within my experience wouldn't I be the perfect person to know

(7:04:29) this I have women admitting to me on the show multiple times yes I have a Ty yes I have a chatter they tell me after the

(7:04:36) show they have management companies I have men who run have a proprietary definition of degeneracy that's it

(7:04:43) that's like done she has proprietary definition for all kinds of [ __ ] you can have proprietary definition like when

(7:04:50) you say proprietary do you just mean prescriptive no proprietary meaning it's a definition unto me it means so you're

(7:04:58) not using what's the difference between proprietary and prescriptive uh well it depend like a prescriptive

(7:05:04) claim a prescriptive definition oh a prescriptive definition yeah so it would be a a prescriptive definition but it

(7:05:11) also be here I'll give you an exact definition so that of the difference between proprietary and prescriptive

(7:05:18) yeah okay yeah so that we have the delineation we just make sure we get it right really quick while he's doing that

(7:05:24) can you pull up the video again because I just wanted to check the pull the video tab yeah 5 10 minutes pull it up

(7:05:30) real quick you said that five 10 minutes ago I was wrong pull it up really quick pull up the video T we we have video

(7:05:37) please the video 7 hours you're in the window tab video tab please can you skip forward to the like

(7:05:43) abuse part I just wanted to make sure I'm quoting it correctly skip forward in any you're not yeah so BL can you skip

(7:05:50) forward proprietary in this case like scroll though can you just

(7:05:58) scroll no can you scroll forward like like in the video yeah yeah I'm looking

(7:06:04) for the here I need to hide this only have hide they have women outside of that context is if they're conservative

(7:06:10) like Candace Owens or lla Rose and obviously they have this structure because their arguments will go

(7:06:15) unchallenged abuse challeng part I don't know where that is though you see there's a very unique setup when it

(7:06:21) comes to men centered around anti-feminist or heavily there are many yeah I think you should go to the

(7:06:28) beginning cuz I think abuse women and I also said that in these spaces as

(7:06:35) well on Tik Tok and that there is similar setups when it comes to this a lot of men will hold anti-feminist

(7:06:42) highly conservative red pill spaces to enact misogyny against the women that you you hold uh anti-il spaces to enact

(7:06:51) mandry upon the men that come into your tiil space am I holding you host Tik

(7:06:56) Tock lives and you specifically seek out to debate men who disagree with your politics and world not men women as well

(7:07:04) it just depends who requests okay fine mostes on and we've debated we've debated come on cuz obviously men would

(7:07:11) hold the okay and mostly women come on here so we're is it I mean I don't see you having like men come on me and

(7:07:19) Andrew did a 2v2 debate against one guy who uh when was that it was it was more

(7:07:25) recent than the Justin Waller appearance but it was what 6 months ago something like that how is this video huh how old

(7:07:31) is my video like two yearses or a year and a half no long is it how old is it I

(7:07:37) think it's it doesn't matter don't worry about a year and a well it does because obviously oh um obviously that 2v2 was

(7:07:44) after I made this video right but now you're you you're not like changing your

(7:07:50) position I'm now referencing that into words that have came out of your mouth I'm saying this is my at this time based

(7:07:57) on the content that I had viewed again if you want me to be specific I can give

(7:08:03) specific Clips but I'm not prepared to I don't know what you want you don't even need to give the clip just tell me

(7:08:08) something that I have said that is misogynistic or abusive I think saying

(7:08:14) you're a degenerate because you're an only fan is misogynistic an only fans model CU you are misogynistic yes you

(7:08:20) are shaming a sex so if I would if I said that to a male only fans model would it be

(7:08:26) misandrist or would it still be misis obviously her gender is going to be at

(7:08:32) the center of the misogyny because a sex worker is out is um is acting outside of the patriarchal

(7:08:39) prescription of their gender which is to be virginal to be virtuous not to sleep

(7:08:45) with men so on I think male sex workers could be degenerate too so would that be

(7:08:50) misogynistic or misandrist it would or neither it would be neither it wouldn't be Mand that's not a social prescription

(7:08:56) of masculinity or of men under patriarchy what if it's under like a world viw I don't hold worldw so I can't

(7:09:04) tell you that okay so it's just you have to understand that everything everything that's come out of this view has been

(7:09:10) the definition only applies to the next proprietary definition proprietary meaning it's you own the definition

(7:09:16) again I haven't heard the difference between proprietary and prescriptive you ever really do want to

(7:09:22) go I don't want to like make it seem like I'm trying to run but this hasn't gone on seven

(7:09:27) hours yeah I but proprietary in this case like I'm sure you want me

(7:09:33) to be here willingly and enthusiastically and I'm not about if we if I give you a hard out in five minutes

(7:09:39) can you stay another 5 minutes like it's 10:0 or it's 11:05 how

(7:09:45) about 11:11 lucky number that's six minute five minutes I'm

(7:09:50) done is like Rage Quit done again like

(7:09:56) I've been saying I want to be done for for a while now going to rect keeps pushing and pushing and pushing and

(7:10:01) pushing but there's going to be an expect just to let you know our dating talk panels go longer than this so there is an expectation what expectation did

(7:10:08) you give me when we discussed it over DMS for this specific discussion I'd have to review the email I don't recall

(7:10:14) exactly it was three hours yeah it was going to be shorter but long to be fair look you brought up the some you guys

(7:10:19) started talking about necrophilia you started talking about start talking about some crazy [ __ ] again maybe this is the failure of moderation for not

(7:10:26) moving topics or having a different dis uh different structure when it comes to the debate

(7:10:31) but I I think I've been a very willing and considerate and uh participant

(7:10:37) panelist and now that I'm done after 7 hours I'm not forcing you to be here I'm

(7:10:43) asking if you st telling me Oh you're going to rage quck when I wanted to go 20 minutes okay fine I was wrong for

(7:10:48) saying you're rage quitting I'm asking if you can stay for an additional 4 minutes that's it and it's a hard out

(7:10:54) 1111 it's 11:06 I'm keeping track here 4 minutes and then uh okay so when I when

(7:11:00) I say proprietary I just mean personal it's your personal definition of a thing um it's not I told you where I got them

(7:11:07) from and were their definition is proprietary um so again it doesn't tell

(7:11:13) me what the difference between a prescriptive definition and a what a prescriptive definition so a prescriptive definition is how the word

(7:11:20) ought to be used the difference between a descriptive and a prescriptive is it describes how people often use it in

(7:11:26) language and then so it's the same as prescriptive or descriptive in philosophy opy prescriptive being what

(7:11:33) you ought do descriptive being just the descriptor of how a thing is so okay so if it's a prescriptive definition

(7:11:39) fortive definition yeah in the Commons there's going to be a different way in which abortion is used than the

(7:11:45) proprietary defition and I think there is validity in having different prescriptive definitions to to explain a

(7:11:52) concept uh while the majority of abortions do end in the death of the fetus I think that a lot of people have

(7:11:58) centered it then that that is the goal of the ab that's not my criticism my criticism is just that everything that

() 

(7:12:04) you utilize is is a definition which feeds a definition which feeds a definition which um which renders these

(7:12:12) Concepts uh true just definitionally true but it doesn't render them actually true like your definition of

(7:12:19) misogyny your your definition of misogyny is essentially only a way to

(7:12:25) demonize men so you say uh well my definition of misogyny is anything which

(7:12:30) uphold the patriarchy right basically no okay what is your definition of misogyny

(7:12:37) the hate or hostility towards women and girls for stepping outside of their patriarchal prescribed gender role okay

(7:12:42) so yeah any so you add the word patriarchy in there so any type of hatred for you for stepping outside of

(7:12:49) whatever patriarchal gend G you have gender is a patriarchal

(7:12:55) prescription how we have conceptualized masculinity and femin I'm just showing you how you use the things to make them

(7:13:00) defin my definition yeah okay well then they're using it to make it definitionally true and you're then

(7:13:06) using it also to make it definitionally true even if it's not true like what definitionally true so that so the idea

(7:13:12) of patriarchy is not anywhere in any common version of misogyny I can find

(7:13:17) anywhere okay so when people are talking about misogyny they don't mean oh you're

(7:13:24) not conforming to whatever this nebulous patriarchy wants you to do they're thinking that you hate women that's what they think sure so so you use this to

(7:13:32) say see you're actually um because you believe in things like patriarchy you're

(7:13:38) definitionally a misogynist no you're [ __ ] not definitionally a misogynist you're only definitionally a misogynist

(7:13:44) under your proprietary definitions that's my problem with marxists in general every time I debate with not a Marxist definition every time I debate

(7:13:51) with marxists they use proprietary definitions that feed proprietary definitions to make them definitionally

(7:13:57) right I don't know why you think this is a Marxist definition I've told you it's from feminist theorist Kate man and is

(7:14:03) Kate man a Marxist I don't think so okay well I don't know her say she created

(7:14:08) one of the top 10 feminist thinkers okay well this is and there's there's arguments to why this definition would be would work better functionally why I

(7:14:15) think when we categorize the Hat uh misogyny is the hatred of women how can

(7:14:21) you determine outside of a man saying I hate women that he hates women because

(7:14:26) he can just essentially say like oh well I love my mother oh well I love my sister sister so of course I don't hate

(7:14:32) women so I'm not being a misogynist yeah what's wrong with that but when we're because then cuz then you can't classify

(7:14:39) anybody as a misogynist the definition isan no it's still not meaningless it absolutely is no you can say I you can

(7:14:45) say that a person hates all women they're a misogynist or you can make another deter all women is absolutely

(7:14:51) ridiculous that that's why you want it to be every single woman like what man would ever meet that standard is it so

(7:14:58) then no one's a misogynist is it well first of all there are men who meet the standard of hating all women who men the

(7:15:03) men who hate all women well where are they men who have described themselves as I hate women I hate women does not

(7:15:10) mean I hate all women okay but when they say I hate all women do you take them at their word I I have not met one man who

(7:15:17) says I hate all it seems to me like you just want to you could actually describe it in different ways too you can say um

(7:15:23) you hate most women or you hate a significant portion of the population does that now not make you a misogynist

(7:15:30) yeah you can do can do that right you can do it in any different way but what you're trying to do is stop for you're

(7:15:35) only trying to expand the definition of of what makes a person misogynist I'm

(7:15:42) trying to make it functional because it does address different uh Concepts when we're talking about misogyny and

(7:15:47) patriarchy obviously under patriarchy it's going to have the prescription of supporting male domination and Supremacy

(7:15:54) which is going to have uh women as subservient or as secondary and so there's going to be specific con

(7:16:00) structions around that and when women don't adhere to it they receive hate and hostility so it is acting as a policing

(7:16:09) of the patriarchy how can you prove that they're receiving hate and hostility just because they're women like if I

(7:16:16) hated a guy for those same exact reasons right stepping outside of whatever their patriarchal role is am I a misogynist

(7:16:22) then well no because again it would be towards girls and women oh right so what

(7:16:28) would you call if you do it to a guy nothing right he's not misogynous um I mean technically that

(7:16:34) would be the definition of mandry I mean if we're saying yeah that they're opposite that

(7:16:39) men are not adhering to their patriarchal prescription just real quick so that we can wrap this up I know you

(7:16:44) want to go and all that okay and it is 1212 I'll finish I'll finish it like right now it's 1212 so hard out yeah

(7:16:51) well I didn't make the agreement I just want to finish the last point last last I me I gave her the heart out if you want

(7:16:58) you're welcome to take the heart to take one last thing I mean I would like to

(7:17:03) finish and close yeah close should we do can we do close is that yes I'm

(7:17:08) CL we'll do this um we can do it tomorrow so whatever your points are can

(7:17:14) we uh you want to save it for tomorrow and do you want to close so I think if I

(7:17:19) recall who opened you opened first so Andrew you get to

(7:17:24) close yeah first and then you make can make it yeah yeah I'll close first so yeah it's all it's always the same thing

(7:17:30) it's always just expand the definition of the thing she says it makes it more functional it's like no it doesn't

(7:17:35) actually make it more functional you can have tons of different definitions for misogyny that are functional for

(7:17:41) instance I just don't like X thing about her because she's a woman that would be a perfect example of what you could call

(7:17:47) misogyny because it's a woman I don't like this trait that's easily provable and demonstratable it's because she's a

(7:17:54) woman that could be considered misogyny it's totally functional there's like a zillion different ways to do this but

(7:17:59) what happens with feminis they constantly take words in the Commons and then what they do is they

(7:18:05) redefine them in order to expand what their meaning is and they and then they make the next definition in order to

(7:18:11) expand on that meaning as well to make the first one make sense etc etc so you spend all your time with them unraveling

(7:18:17) the semantics in the language before you can even get to a damn argument which they never have because the second you

(7:18:22) move it outside of their definitions there is no argument to be had it's just it's all definitional

(7:18:29) based it's just based on my proprietary definition of this word this word uses

(7:18:34) the loaded context of the word like misogyny which is very loaded it's a very loaded context but people don't

(7:18:41) think of this uh word as meaning well based on my proprietary definition it

(7:18:47) actually means Behavior which doesn't moves outside of the Accord of what the patriarchy would think your behavior ordinarily should be nobody thinks of it

(7:18:54) that way they think of it as you hate women or you hate people based on the fact that or you yeah you just hate them

(7:19:00) based on the fact they're women that's it that's what they think misogyny is so what happens is you take this term which

(7:19:06) is loaded in the public domain and uh with the hatred towards women and then

(7:19:12) you expand it to include all these other things you can use the hatred around the room and expand that to more men who

(7:19:19) don't fall under the idea of hatred of women and it's a typical bait and switch and it's very frustrating because uh

(7:19:27) they do this with other things too they do this with fascist Nazi at this point

(7:19:32) by the way you're basically just a Nazi if you're not like I mean if you're not like just on

(7:19:38) your knees worshiping trans lgbtq women you're just a Nazi like that's that's the way they view it because they've

(7:19:45) expanded the definition of what that is so this is just like how it always works and it's super frustrating and you can

(7:19:50) barely get to any points because you can't address the point outside of their definition so they just make everything

(7:19:56) definitionally true' be like if I said well I think m Y is when you talk back

(7:20:02) to me it's like well they'd be like no it's not like yeah I think it's just

(7:20:08) like when you talk back to me that's missandry would that be true no right it

(7:20:13) wouldn't be true but you I mean you could you would it would be definitionally true if she then talked

(7:20:19) back to me and I called her a mandress right that would be definitionally true and this is how all these loaded terms

(7:20:24) work so it's super frustrating all the things that we went over very quickly in the beginning she never really gave a

(7:20:30) good account for first second third wave feminism feeding women into the capitalist meat locker meat grinder except to say well I

(7:20:37) guess I don't actually agree with those waves of feminism even though I'm a feminist I'm just on some weird bizarre

(7:20:44) Fringe into feminism um we got into the feminist movement um and oppression cruel and

(7:20:51) unusual punishment there wasn't a lot of arguments there either um let's see what else did we get

(7:20:58) into here oh yeah we got into debt and it doesn't

(7:21:03) seem like the idea that women now being in debt in any way shape or form makes

(7:21:09) them more liberated than when they depended on their husband she just kind of says well I just think that they are

() 

(7:21:14) there's no real good reason that she ever gave for it um and then what else did we cover a few things few other

(7:21:21) things I was trying to take notes as I went oh yeah jail she doesn't believe in jail she just believes in Rehabilitation

(7:21:28) but then we dive into what Rehabilitation is it's basically jail they can't leave right and if you do

(7:21:34) leave they're going to come get you and take you back it's like it's basically jail so it's just all these crazy ass

(7:21:40) circles um and then we get we get to the idea of abortion the idea of um of

(7:21:48) murder things like this and um so that was a bait and switch it's not really

(7:21:53) all nine months it's again a very proprietary definition of abortion

(7:21:59) designed to bait and switch and then um we we got into consent you know she

(7:22:05) thinks that two people are drunk they're graping each other if a if a husband wakes wakes his wife up with sex he's a

(7:22:12) Grapist if she wakes him up with sex he she's a Grapist it's like that shit's [ __ ] crazy but at least there we got

(7:22:18) a definition of what it was that we wanted so that we could point out the insanity so I'm done with that I'm

(7:22:24) that's my closing I appreciate it Kenzie yeah so I think when we're talking about

(7:22:29) specific Concepts that we want to convey it's disingenuous and actually a logical fallacy to just say that oh we should

(7:22:36) Define these words as the definition uh the dictionary prescribes because that's how like the commons uses it if we're

(7:22:43) having an intellectual discussion and I say something like well peanut butter Supremacy and you're like well what is peanut butter and then we agree on the

(7:22:50) definition then essentially I've just effectively communicated my concept to you we just use words as symbols and so

(7:22:59) using abortion in the aspect like I've talked about before um I think a lot of

(7:23:04) people have the notion that abortion the purpose of it is to terminate the life of the fetus when that's not true it is

(7:23:11) to end pregnancy and that is an important distinction that I want to make because there are cases um where

(7:23:18) the fetus has already passed and the body has failed to uh complete the miscarriage and so an abortion is

(7:23:25) necessary um where there are Health complications and deliberately turning the the uh terminating the pregnancy is

(7:23:32) necessary and so when when and I I just can't believe where that we have a

(7:23:39) debate for several hours and even take the time to outline the how we're

(7:23:45) conveying certain Concepts and then because the concept is concise it's

(7:23:50) disingenuous because it doesn't agree with the dictionary that just seems so contradictory to me um I think in in

(7:23:57) aspects of of sexual consent yes we absolutely want to have a conscious

(7:24:03) partner that's just absolutely wild to me that um he's more interested in his

(7:24:08) wife sleeping rather than just waking her up and wanting to engage where you know consent is

(7:24:13) reversible um and there's Mutual experience and pleasure I mean he even said his he's only worried about his own

(7:24:19) experience which is very red flag for me um we did talk about the different waves

(7:24:24) of feminism which I even said I didn't like categorizing feminism within that method because then it leaves out

(7:24:31) specific sex of feminism when it comes to uh abolitionists who were feminists

(7:24:37) which were obviously going to be a lot of women of color and I don't want to whitewash uh when it comes to certain

(7:24:43) ideas of feminism that just because Bourgeois white women wanted to participate in voting in political power

(7:24:51) with men that somehow this encompasses the entire first wave I think that's marginalization of of racial groups and

(7:24:59) I I already did dis agree with him that I don't like liberal feminism that we should be looking to for women to find

(7:25:04) the means of Liberation under capitalism I think if we give women more Choice

(7:25:09) under oppression that's better than less choice and so that's what that would boil down to but obviously I would like

(7:25:15) to get rid of this the oppress oppressive system in general we didn't really talk anything about second third

(7:25:20) or fourth wave feminism I do want to highlight too that um I think he gave some information that was incorrect

(7:25:26) people do live long healthy lives with just one kidney so sometimes in these discussions it's hard to always fact

(7:25:33) check which I do want to say to your point I definitely give people on um my

(7:25:39) live the space to look up information or to give me what they're reading uh because I do want the intellectual

(7:25:45) challenge I do want the discourse um I do want the knowledge um where obviously we're

(7:25:52) limited within this kind of perview um to really ask for sources which I know can be very boring and take time but but

(7:25:59) that's kind of delineation I think that's important to make um I mean the

(7:26:05) abolition of police and prisons is not a new take I'm not the first person to have that and again I think just to say

(7:26:12) that jail is just sequestering from society again is is an inaccurate way to

(7:26:19) represent what prison and what policing actually is uh e even prison especially

(7:26:27) within America is um just a new strategy to continue to enact slavery and

(7:26:33) obviously since uh people of color are disproportionately affected by the police it it's just a new method to do

(7:26:40) so and then prisoners don't have uh they're not humanized they don't have rights and I do think even when people

(7:26:46) have committed harm in society that they don't lose their humanity and dignity to where we can just treat them like

(7:26:51) garbage and so that's the delineation between prisons and then obviously

(7:26:56) having someone who's committed depending what crime it is what strategies we can take for them so that we actually

(7:27:02) prevent the harm in the future rather than just punish and release them into a system where where crime and and harm is

(7:27:10) prevalent um I think policing's different but we didn't really touch on policing so I won't touch that

(7:27:17) um yeah and oh sorry is that more no I I think that that sums it up okay

(7:27:23) appreciate you me on Rachel Wilson says I've given Andrew lifelong IR retractable consent Lady it's called marriage I think it's weird that you

(7:27:30) think it's weird I don't know if you want to respond to this but we can leave it there no I don't okay we'll leave it

(7:27:35) there um I know you have to go I'm going to let some of the other chats come in

(7:27:40) so me and Andrew will continue the stream I can't end it immediately just because we have them coming through but

(7:27:46) you want your the heart out so thank you for coming Ken appreciate it Kenzie it

(7:27:51) was a very uh interesting debate I think honestly one I think it we've had we've

(7:27:56) done a lot of these debates I think Andrew maybe this is probably one of the better ones in terms of an opponent sure

(7:28:05) okay I don't know trying to do a little compliment there at the end but Kenzie thank you so much for coming do

(7:28:10) appreciate it we'll see you uh tomorrow and uh please don't report us to the

(7:28:15) police that we held you hostage there at the end uh thank you Kenzie oh is he about guys he's about to eat oh my we
