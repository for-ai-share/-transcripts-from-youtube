URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HSK2QTWWM

(0:00) about gender uh abolition and gender roles so I think the let's just quickly go over the initial proposition I think
(0:06) the initial proposition should be like are gender roles good bad do they serve a purpose or do they not uh is it
(0:12) something that we should stick to or is it something we should remove something like that are you guys both okay with
(0:18) that sure yeah I don't I don't care it's uh it's her prop so what whatever her
(0:25) opening is it it regardless of of that it's it's fine with me
(0:30) okay you know would you mind going first uh I mean no one's really the Challenger here since I was kind of set up this
(0:35) debate but uh I mean if you if you don't want to we can have Andrew go first but I think yeah I think it will make sense
(0:42) for you to go first so Andrew could understand your position better and then he can respond to it sure um there's a lot of intri
(0:50) intricacies of gender abolition that um I don't know um how much I feel need to
(0:57) be brought up necessarily but the main premise of it is generally the elimination of gender
(1:05) roles there's more complicated aspects of it as well that go into a lot of like very um theoretical um philosophical
(1:12) conversations which I imagine that's not very fun to talk about um but it's fun
(1:17) for me to talk about but okay what whatever you want I think I
(1:24) think your position wait Andrew this this is opening thoughts like let her make her opening wait I didn't even know
(1:29) we were live I thought we were still hashing out thought we were still hashing out what we were talking about oh I thought okay no it's fine we can
(1:35) hash it out before we get into that yeah I've been so yeah you guys want just want to quickly establish this and then
(1:40) we'll get into it no no I'm good I'm sorry go go ahead I I didn't even realize I didn't even know we were live so no no apology sir um okay yeah
(1:49) continue okay um so what I find um appealing to
(1:56) gender abolition is the you know obviously the uh abolition of generals I think the that the phrasing of abolition
(2:04) doesn't do it any favors um as a like concept it's kind of like how people like like when you first see it you're
(2:10) like the police abolition like oh so there's going to be no you know all of that type of thing I don't I think it's
(2:15) a great phrasing so I don't want people to get wrapped up in in what that means um it's it's it's a you know a theory
(2:23) basically um that is just generally saying that gender roles are pretty
(2:28) Antiquated they're not really very necessary and I think they're actually at this point a hindrance and what I
(2:33) mean by that is that it's a hindrance to the point of I don't know why you know like you you would imagine that you'd
(2:39) want the the first the best person for the job to get said job um and there's
(2:45) no direct line that oh all of a sudden because it's in this particular role
(2:51) that is related to like you know your like you're if you're like a guy or whatever um that you're going to be
(2:57) better at those things when I think that the rigid aspects of gender roles like will kind of assume that which I think
(3:03) we could hopefully agree doesn't really make sense like if you're going to go into a job that's maybe like okay I'm
(3:10) doing construction maybe a guy would be better at that because of the physical aspect of it um but if we're going into
(3:16) a job like where most of our jobs are right now in in obviously like like white collar um or service industry we
(3:23) we're not doing like strength based things we're using technology right there really isn't any reason to have any um different
(3:30) when it comes to like careers um I think it's very tox to change a little bit here when it comes to generals I think
(3:36) it's incred incredibly toxic to say like oh guys can't be stay-at-home fathers
(3:42) because they're not men if they can't be stay-at-home fathers I think that is really like anti-man personally I think
(3:48) that that's really stupid and I think that it's harmful to both men and women to have these roles where you
(3:55) can't you can't do something that you want to do because you are you know either a man or a woman I think that
(4:01) that's like one of the worst things about gender roles is just that aspect where it's telling you what you can and
(4:07) you cannot do because you just are one thing and I think that that's Antiquated stupid and unhelpful
(4:16) and I don't understand how anyone could defend that okay
(4:25) Andrew yeah so I didn't I didn't actually hear an argument of any kind for anything not a not a single op
(4:32) actually didn't even hear really a description for what is right just kind of like just this nebulous you know I
(4:40) don't really think that you know like a construction worker should be barred from being a woman or dude should be
(4:46) barred from being a stay-at-home dad which they're not no nobody's barred from that I'm not exactly sure what
(4:53) Nina's position is um I'm not really sure nah has a position luckily I have a
(4:58) fantastic position so maybe nah can like play off of that okay so for those of
(5:04) you who don't know I have a bit of a history with nah so let me kind of explain to you what this history is it's
(5:10) my contention that nah and people like nah suffer from a condition where microorganisms infect their brains
(5:17) called Noms these Noms get in there and start making them say and do and assert
(5:23) ridiculous [ __ ] that nobody cares about and makes no sense in this particular case the Nom moids have gotten in there
(5:30) and have convinced Nina for reasons unbeknownst to me and anybody else who
(5:35) has any type of logic and reason or you know will of any kind um that men and
(5:43) women are equal which they're not equal there is no such thing as egalitarianism we've been over this before but when it
(5:49) comes to gender itself nah tell you that she's a gender abolitionist right you first you have to
(5:56) you have to start with the Assumption the very weak assumption this logical IAL chain first and foremost that
(6:01) there's a such thing as gender at all that it's not just some sort of complete societal construction that's limited
(6:08) based on whatever tribe you're a part of or whatever locality that you're a part of my contention very simply is that
(6:16) gender itself doesn't even exist that everything that Nina would consider to be a socially constructed gender role is
(6:23) actually a biologically grounded phase of sex and necessary for the perpetuation of human existence
(6:30) that's what I think but that's also because you know I'm a person who has some s sort of grounding in these things
(6:36) and have thought about them over and over again um so I'd like to hear like what anina's thoughts on transgenderism
(6:43) that would be uh a focus of gender for instance not just uh uh transgenderism
(6:49) but transracialism I'd like to hear Nina's take on that I'd like to hear Nina's take on gender right as it uh as
(6:57) it appears that she it can just be changeable and malleable and it's not really related to sex so that's kind of
(7:04) where I'm at cool let me just give a quick statement so I'm going to be generally hands off during this moderation I will step in only in two
(7:11) situations number one where it's so much over talking no one can understand anyone I will allow for a good amount of
(7:18) like you know discourse and banter but if it gets to the point where no one can understand anyone I will step in or
(7:23) number two if I feel like the conversation is completely off the RO else in which case I will try to redirect it but generally speaking you
(7:28) guys probably won't hear he much from me during this debate all right guys floor is yours love nids again yeah the nids uh
(7:37) so so before the the Noms become too overwhelming you have to begin to um dog
(7:43) mom drink them away with your wine cup what do you think that gender is
(7:49) Nina well you said it didn't exist I'm a little confused on what your stance on that is what I think gender is gender is
(7:55) a socially constructed um uh performance basically that
(8:01) uh is a display to go towards like a very like either a feminine or
(8:06) masculine interpretation of yourself so it doesn't exist it's not a physical reality what
(8:13) do you mean does it exist is is a does a play exist like what do you you smell it taste it touch it can is does it
(8:19) actually exist or is it just something that is in our brains that we make up you can see it like what do you mean
(8:26) like where do you see it at Define what you're saying about existing cuz it seems like you're being a
(8:32) little ironically NE nebulous about it no ironically I'm not being nebulous at all so like the word gender obviously
(8:39) exists the phrase gender exists the theory of gender Theory exists so um like are you say
(8:45) like what are you trying to say exactly I'm trying to ask you if this thing exists is a physical reality or if it's
(8:52) simply an emotional manifestation or a human social construction meaning if all
(8:58) human beings were soci construction okay if it's a human social construction it doesn't exist in reality it's just made
(9:06) up I don't see that direct connection between that like that's like saying like um words don't exist because if
(9:12) humans weren't there there wouldn't be words words do exist such a okay because of what explain to me why
(9:19) because because of sound you have sound and interpreters which interpret the sound and so you have physical existence
(9:25) but if humans don't exist then you're kind of like giving me a if a tree falls in the wood would have make a sound argument here like that's just no I'm
(9:32) I'm not giv let me try to let me try to help you out here right all I'm looking
(9:37) to establish from you because you are a gender abolitionist meaning you want to abolish gender just trying to establish
(9:44) if gender is real or if it's not real if it if it exists in tangible reality or
(9:49) if it's just some madeup [ __ ] that you're trying to abolish literally everything is made up if we're
(9:55) talking about language so I think that we're kind of on this level right now and and I think not everything not
(10:02) everything is made up when we're talking about language what do you mean that's absurd makes no
(10:08) sense there's all kinds of things in language that isn't made up right that is a physical manifestation that you can
(10:14) look at language itself is made up yes you could say that the process is a social construction that's fine so
(10:20) that's made up got it right so I'm just trying to figure out you want to abolish this thing is this thing real that you
(10:26) want to abolish to begin with Andrew just to quickly clarify your position for the chat you believe sex is real but
(10:32) gender is made up correct that's correct that's a biological reality and so what I think is that all these social
(10:38) behaviors that nah thinks is relate are related to you're a man or you're a
(10:44) woman okay and that and and this these are genders so this is the way she perceives it she says if x amount of
(10:50) traits are masculine that's manly if x amount of traits are feminine um then
(10:55) that's that's womanly right this is this is the way that she perceived this so I'm saying that me clarify hang on let
(11:02) me clarify my position I'm almost done and then I'll pass the floor over to you what I'm saying specifically is that the
(11:08) way that human beings interact with their environment is directly associated
(11:13) with their sex so their sex and how they react with their environment is going to create the relationship of what you
(11:19) consider to be masculine or feminine via necessity things like short hair wearing
(11:25) jewelry all of these things are actually manifestations that are NE uh NE uh Necessities for men
(11:33) in order to get along in whatever their environment is so you can say like short hair for a military haircut lack of
(11:38) jewelry because your hands get caught in things and etc etc etc there's almost always a practical explanation and
(11:45) application which is environmental which manifests itself as to why it is that these behaviors exist rather than the
(11:52) fact that it's just um well we we just made up these uh these social roles one day and we need to reverse engineer them
(11:58) so that now we're equal that's bizarre okay it's funny that you
(12:05) mentioned jewelry because that used to be a very masculine trait to wear a bunch of Jew jewelry so I feel like um a
(12:11) lot of like the history that we look back on traits of um both men and uh or
(12:18) I guess like we're going to be like biological females biological men whatever like what was considered
(12:26) of uh traditionally like uh biological females would you know wear dress
(12:32) biological whatever all like the dress the way that they'd act like all of those behaviors have changed like so
(12:38) many times throughout history that I find it very odd for you to say that like
(12:43) oh there isn't like a cultural sense of a gendered expectation to be one sort of
(12:50) way because it relates to your uh your I guess your uh uh your your sex sorry um
(12:58) and and you're it tell me that like wearing jewelry is more what
(13:06) feminine like I I I don't really know where you're at depends on what the environmental setup was that caused that
(13:12) behavior to become integrated with masculine or feminine Behavior so you're then telling me that
(13:18) it's socially conditioned right because it has to have to do with your environment well it's not just socially
(13:25) conditioned I'm saying that there's a biological catalyst for it so well then why have things been the opposite
(13:31) throughout time like Jew us to been a very masculine thing to have a lot of
(13:37) jewelry yeah it could be that the environmental manifestation for this becoming something that's masculine is
(13:43) that jewelry was extremely rare and so for men to establish dominance over
(13:48) other men via wealth they would wear their actual wealth that could be one explanation for why that's a that's a
(13:55) manifestation of environment with sex but it always if you look for a descriptor of why these things end up
(14:01) happening why we make these associations you can always Whittle it back to the biological sex of the person and people
(14:08) group engaging with material reality okay and the environment and those
(14:14) creating the social behaviors via necessity even right now that's the case via necessity what do you mean when you
(14:20) say via necessity so there was some there's some reason for it that uh is environmental
(14:28) and their biology intersects with the environment and that's the reason that these behaviors
(14:33) start why is there a biological reason to wear jewelry I just gave you the example I just gave what was my example
(14:40) that I just gave you Nina repeat it back to me of why that how that could be the case uh that men would find it uh to be
(14:48) good to wear a lot of jewelry at certain points in history why would they think that as a possibility I assume because
(14:54) they just like like the way it looks because they just want status symbol probably I don't know yeah status symbol
(15:00) right so so the biological human male behavior of being a dominant over one
(15:05) another one of the ways in which you can show your dominance is with displays of wealth so if you have a display of
(15:11) wealth in this case jewelry of course it would be considered masculine or maybe Stylistics or maybe clothing or all
(15:18) sorts of different Trends but all of it is dictated around the the biology of
(15:23) both the male and the females interacting with their environment so I'm saying that these aren't just car
(15:29) istics of people who are who have like oh I think that pink is just pretty so
(15:34) we consider it feminine that's way more complex than that okay so it seems like you're just
(15:40) kind of going in a circle trying to weirdly like kind of agree with me that
(15:45) you are saying it's just socially conditioned then you understand what social conditioning means right well no it's not just socially
(15:53) conditioned it's it would be the opposite of just socially conditioned I'm saying that there's actually biological functions which make these
(16:01) social conditions let me give you an example of how I know that that's true can you name a place on planet Earth
(16:07) where men or women predominantly act as the protectors and act as the physical
(16:12) arm and act as the strength of whatever the tribe or nation is and that this is
(16:18) purp have no idea what this has to do with je can we stand well because what I'm saying is that anywhere anywhere on
(16:24) planet Earth there's a biological reality that there's a huge difference between men and Wom women and one of
(16:30) those one of those huge differences is the interaction with environment is that men are far stronger so they almost
(16:35) always no not even they always end up moving into those roles by necessity
(16:41) that's the way their biology interacts with the environment and why the social behavior begins to begin with okay so
(16:48) why would they were Jew then I just gave you the example
(16:54) noting but why did you relate that to the jewelry conversation we were just having I I don't understand your logic
(17:00) here like you're saying like oh because biology the way biology interacts with environment is what actually creates
(17:06) what you consider gender that's why what do you mean by very specifically what do you mean when
(17:12) biology interacts with environment because that kind of just sounds like me that you're just literally describing like social
(17:18) conditioning well I've already okay is is um is your sex socially
(17:25) conditioned is your no no it's not it's biological reality right sure and the
(17:32) distinctions in these realities is that men have different hormones they have uh different even different brain
(17:38) archetypes different interests all sorts of different things that just by by
(17:43) itself the hormones on average between the two uh create physical differences
(17:50) between the two to the point where uh it you know it's almost absurd to say otherwise right so if that's the case if
(17:57) just just off of the difference in chemical makeup between men and women they then have to operate with whatever
(18:04) their environment is their localized environment whether it's let's say the desert let's say the forest let's say
(18:10) the big the Great Plains wherever it is the the biological makeup of men and women are going to interact with those
(18:16) environments differently based on strength differentials interest differentials all these different types
(18:22) of things so the biological extension of them engaging with their environment itself is going to create these
(18:30) naturally distinct roles but many of them become universalized there's a distinction in other words between men
(18:36) and women biologically okay you're going off in a tangent here my guy I gotta it's not a
(18:41) tangent like I'm trying to explain it so a two-year-old would understand
(18:46) it right but then I mean it's very confusing as an again
(18:52) let's just keep with the jewelry conversation if we want to keep it simple I feel like that's the best way to go about it let's just stay focused
(18:57) on the example so why how would you explain with your or with um you know
(19:03) what you were saying about the biological relating to your your environment thing with the jewelry where there used to be a very uh male Centric
(19:10) thing to wear jewelry and or high heels or high heels could be exactly or any
(19:16) different number of stylistic how how is that not social if it's changed with
(19:22) biological men now do not tend to do that because Ferraris didn't exist Nina
(19:27) because they displayed their wealth in a different way Nina obviously that's why because they they didn't
(19:34) have let me finish I'm trying to finish because they didn't they weren't able they weren't able to peacock with their
(19:41) Ferrari or their Lamborghini or their giant mansion or this type of thing but it's the same was the same thing it's a
(19:47) demonstration of wealth for dominance or to attract the female or
(19:53) whatever okay so why why don't modern guys just they do PE is an as right but what
(20:01) okay so then why why aren't they wearing heels that well no what they do now is
(20:06) they get their legs broken they get their legs broken and then have their legs extended so that they appear taller
(20:14) instead of wearing heels they literally get their legs broken now Nina because of science because
(20:21) science finish n you asked me a question you need to let me finish the answer
(20:26) literally men will get their legs broken and then reconstructed so that they
(20:32) appear to be taller this was the same reason that it used to be style stylish
(20:37) for men to wear lifts they weren't directly high heels but they were lifted shoes so that they appeared taller wait
(20:44) but if there's status symbols if there's status symbols that doesn't really make any
(20:49) sense right cuz I assume the idea that the heels were a status symbol was because they were expensive to make
(20:57) that's could be one reason talking about the the breaking the legs the breaking the legs thing if if you
(21:03) can't tell that you paid for that then how is that a size symbol okay listen I'm I'm saying that
(21:10) it's both and it could be both and so it could be that they want to appear taller could be that they want to appear taller
(21:17) so they wear boots for instance maybe lifted boots or lifted shoes or they have their legs broken to extend their
(21:22) height or they wear certain shoes which are completely nonfunctional in reality
(21:28) but are god- awful expensive uh and they want to wear those as a status symbol
(21:33) which uh which many men do that as well so all of it all of these different
(21:39) reasons in other words are extensions of the biological reality of men's behavior
(21:44) being different so to summarize this gender is a direct expression of biological sex interacting with
(21:53) environment I mean it really I don't really want to keep going on with circles in this but like you're
(22:00) really just literally describing like social factors here so um I think like
(22:06) you're kind of co- posting a little bit about the the the sex being related to it I'm sure things like have like a very
(22:12) small degree of uh relation depending on like your biology I guess but I mean
(22:19) which one do you think is more powerful like um what do you think about the
(22:25) whole um no cuz we kind of wanted to bring this up yeah that is true your audio is desynced by the way you might
(22:31) want to log out and log back in what's the is her audio is
(22:37) desynced it is yeah it is it maybe that's on I mean Alex you're
(22:45) the is how it sounds fine for me uh no it's not it it doesn't it's not a sound
(22:51) issue she I know I'm saying I don't see it Chad look straight look straight at the
(22:56) camera and say test one two3 so can see for himself test one two three did you see that okay there's a little bit of a
(23:02) l yeah it's minor but yeah if you want to loog back in it's fine but it's not significant but it's up to
(23:08) you like you're just trying to say that to throw me off my game I mean I'll just I'll just do right in the mic
(23:13) unnecessary for me to do anything to throw you off your game Nina it's completely
(23:19) unnecessary uh I mean the fact that I'm running it through OBS might be the reason why and I'm not going to fix that so it's as long as it's a it's fine it's
(23:27) not sign it's not okay yeah okay sorry where were we at Mr
(23:33) distracting you were about to ask me a question can you give me the context
(23:38) you're the one who distracted me the context for your question I have no idea
(23:43) what we talking about previously my guy well I don't know my
(23:49) girl like sneak I don't know I don't know what your I don't know what your
(23:54) question was you guys were talking about you guys were talking about status symbols and how like back then they used
(24:00) to wear heels now they don't arguments because of technology I think you're going to give some Counterpoint uh to that or ask him a
(24:07) question I don't know right I remember saying something about like not W to go in circles about this but as you collect
(24:12) your thoughts and find your next cup of wine I'll crack a beer here while uh
(24:18) while you figure out what it is that you wanted to ask me so one more time to State my position gender is a direct expression biological sex interacting
(24:26) with environment Oh I thought you said it didn't exist one more time what you're calling gender
(24:33) it's an internal critique gender yes it's an internal critique Nina okay but then it kind of tracks in some way
(24:41) because it seems like you're stating exactly what a socially conditioned thing is so I think we're kind of in
(24:47) agreement on this I guess we're just choosing to uh it's not socially conditioned one more time to repeat my
(24:53) position back no it's a social structure and not say it's socially conditioned I think it's a social structure it's just
(24:58) like a social thing literally it's you reacting with your environment that's what a social thing is let me let me
(25:04) clarify this because I think I understand Andrew's position so Andrew is saying that your gender is always GNA be the same as your sex the whole
(25:10) concept of a gender social construct because you cannot have a different gender than your sex right it's the same thing gender really means sex right
(25:16) correct Andrew yes that's correct they're interchangeable terms literally interchangeable terms right and Nina I
(25:22) believe you don't believe that I believe you can have a difference between gender and sex and I believe that gender for example is something that's not
(25:27) necessarily 100% reliant on sex right so that's that's kind of the quux of it yeah it's an expression of
(25:34) yourself to uh relate to more like either feminine or um I mean obviously
(25:39) an gender abolition it it is kind of unironically a little bit in agreement with the fact that it doesn't exist
(25:46) you're kind of like going full C full circle on this where you actually align more with like the the more radical um
(25:53) theories of gender abolition that would actually agree with what you're saying um where is just a bunch of like social
(26:00) relations between like um uh between your your sex and the way
(26:06) that you're perceived but I feel like what we're we're missing here um is the
(26:12) understanding of what modern versions of like gender is and the subtleties of um
(26:20) what it would look like gender abolition in the future would look like versus what it is now um because I know you wanted to talk about like you know
(26:26) transness and stuff like that um and I think that it's really interesting conversation to have but I just want to
(26:32) make sure that you understand what I'm saying when I do say things like you're kind of going like full circle to being
(26:38) a little bit like of a gender abolitionist yourself where um to I abolish a thing which doesn't exist okay
(26:45) but you're using the word so the point is to change what it would that's because the word is the word is
(26:52) completely synonymous with the word sex they mean the same same exact thing when people in modern times say the word
(26:57) gender they actually mean the word sex they've always meant it this way they have never meant it as a set value of
(27:04) behaviors between uh the two Sexes they've always meant it as just being
(27:09) sex so if you go back to the 90s and you play Boulders gate and it says select a gender it's asking you to select a sex
(27:16) it's not asking you to select a carefully assorted uh uh bunch of traits that you think are associated with a
(27:22) woman it's literally asking you to to pick a sex that's what it means by gender
(27:29) okay yeah no I mean like yeah Boulders G very good uh factual statement or no all
(27:35) all everything everything you could possibly imagine for the word gender which has always always been used since
(27:41) its Inception by John money does your driver's license John money has all your
(27:46) driver's license doesn't ask you for gender it asks you for sex right so like an actual government
(27:53) yeah but John money came up with the modern conceptualization of gender and when it introduced out into the ethos
(28:00) and people began to use it they used it as a synonym for sex it was never used as a trait specific characterization for
(28:07) x amount of female behaviors or what we perceive as female behaviors in whatever Society you are makes you a woman that's
(28:14) insane and has never been the truth right you guys disagree about what gender is that's the
(28:19) part well he's saying it is okay so you said you want to talk about gender roles then and if you're going to tell me that
(28:25) gender doesn't exist where are we at on that one sex roles you think that gender is a
(28:34) separate conceptualization of sex I do not if you're going to make the claim
(28:40) though that gender and sex is the same thing then we are in agreement and you could just concede the debate they
(28:47) didn't say that well then make an argument I asked you a question about what what are gender roles to you then well there's no such just told you
(28:54) there's no such thing there's just Sexes interacting with their environment there's male and female that's it that's
(29:00) it it's all there is okay so you just refuse to accept the idea that there are gender roles I talked to you before my
(29:07) guy like that's not what your position was back why don't you tell me what my position was before well you thought that gender
(29:13) roles were a good thing really why don't you point out any place I've ever said anything of the sort when we're
(29:19) especially gender roles is it's absurd on its face there's just sex there's
(29:25) biological sex there's nothing outside of that never has been anything outside of that anything that you consider to be
(29:32) this set value group of feminine or masculine traits is nothing more than an extension of your actual Baseline
(29:39) biology okay and you just make up a word in your head in order to accommodate
(29:44) like this small group of mentally ill people basically nothing else which is
(29:50) who in this case transgenders what does that have to do with gender
(29:56) roles well because they're trying trying to change your gender Nina they say that your gender is not based on your
(30:02) biological sex but whether it it's a construction you understand gender roles are gender roles have really nothing to
(30:08) do with trans people yeah I understand conceptually what you're saying a gender role is
(30:15) right I'm just telling you that it's not some sort of movement of pushed behavior
(30:22) um saying if you're a girl we expect you to act this way rather it's a set of
(30:27) environment what it is right so that's the now you're getting to the Crux of the disagreement rather it's a
(30:32) biological reality of your sex engaging with environment which creates conditions where you have to act in
(30:39) certain ways because to do otherwise would be in contrary to your own
(30:46) nature so you just think anyone that doesn't go with whatever I don't know sex roles you want to call it like okay
(30:53) so for example like if somebody doesn't want to have children or like doesn't want to take care of the children um you
(31:00) know or a a sis woman doesn't want to take care of children and wants to just
(31:07) work just just a woman you mean a sis woman woman yes a sis woman yes what makes her
(31:13) sis the fact that her um gender identity aligns with her um sex what does that
(31:19) mean your gender identity so if that's true then how do you perceive yourself what makes Alex
(31:25) white I don't know who that is the the guy who's hosting the debate what makes him white oh I didn't know your last
(31:32) name sorry his first name is Alex what are you what are you talk it's in bold
(31:37) it's in bold his name is in bold it's a l EA you can't miss it how the [ __ ] am I
(31:42) gonna assume that I thought just see Alex Jones I'm gonna assume
(31:48) that it's Alex like him like what theing what makes Alex the guy whose name is
(31:53) desate in a big bold letters a x what makes him
(32:00) white what makes him white Nina Oh I thought you were saying his last name was white Jesus [ __ ] sorry that's not at
(32:08) all what we were talking about I I was not misunderstanding my bad I thought you said what makes Alex white and then
(32:14) just like stop talking um what makes him white like I what what the [ __ ] does that have to do
(32:20) with like your gender identity well because is it just an identity that he's
(32:25) white well I mean whiteness and itself is um more of a metric of like power
(32:31) like as we know obviously in the past like even like Germans weren't considered white back in the day so can he CH going hang on so can he change his
(32:39) him himself being white as an identity okay as I said that has nothing
(32:45) to do with what we're talking about when it comes to it does have ex wait so you think that race is same
(32:53) as sex that's what you're trying to argue right now
(32:58) what you're trying to argue I'm saying that biologically if you think that white is not biological but rather a
(33:05) social construction and and gender is just a status of identity and has nothing to do with Biology then I need
(33:13) you to tell me if you can change your gender the socially constructed thing
(33:19) that we uh perceive women as can you change your race the same
(33:24) way in the same way as in how as in can Alex begin to identify as a black man
(33:31) and would it be true um I mean if you're going to talk about like if he's like related to the
(33:37) black community he can obviously have like a more of a a feeling of more belonging to that
(33:46) group of people but I don't like I don't know what you're trying to say with that like if we're talking about like
(33:51) identify can he get affirmative can he get affirmative action can he get affirmative action If he ident if he
(33:57) identifies as let's say he's raised in the black community okay and he he has
(34:02) adopted the entirety of their culture and their Norms my God and he he identifies as being black can he get
(34:08) affirmative action hum yeah can he get affirmative action
(34:14) Nina um I don't believe that is how that works no no no that's not how it works however in your mind this gender rule
(34:21) switch you think that trans women should be considered actual biological hang on let me finish let me finish about
(34:28) reality here I mean you've been talking way more than I have come on just finish point and I'll give it to you let me
(34:33) finish my point let me finish my point so how this is one for one analogous is you think that trans women should be
(34:41) afforded all the same rights as biological women so I want to know if you think that people who just identify
(34:48) as a different race should also be afforded the same status as that race rights I think everyone should have the
(34:55) same rights absolutely what the [ __ ] women so hang on you think that women is a legit woman is legitimate protected
(35:01) class right um is it I don't know is it yeah yeah of course they have their own
(35:07) sports leagues they have their own sports they have their own everything I
(35:13) don't think you know what a protected class what is it Nina you're talking protected class is something you could like uh you know like hate crimes
(35:21) yeah that that's what usually is considered under the protective class laws yeah like Christian
(35:28) would be that would be a protected class different races would be a protected class women would would
(35:35) operate under protected class they're going to have different considerations for women when they apply for college when they apply for stem Fields when
(35:41) they apply for these different things they have their own forms of affirmative action for women they're a protected class so my I'm asking you specifically
(35:48) is if Alex can change his race if race is socially constructed if it's a social construct they're not a protected
(35:55) class oh man okay f Nina they're not a protected class uh either way can Alex
(36:03) change his race and get the same protection of class that blacks would
(36:09) have um I don't think you can change your race I don't know how that would go
(36:15) I don't think there's any mechanism for it you can I don't know if you know this but on your um on your ID you can if
(36:21) we're going to we're just talking like legal stuff right so we're talking about like if you change your uh you can actually change your ID to say that
(36:27) you're you're female um and then you are um able to get certain like if we're talking about like grants that maybe
(36:33) like people can get from being like like tax breaks or whatever for being women own again I don't necessarily agree with
(36:41) um affirmative action to begin with so I don't really know how much that you think that's gotcha but like I
(36:46) personally don't necessarily even have a very strong um feeling about that
(36:52) affirmative action is positive it's I'm I'm kind of on the fence about it personally well whether it's positive or not try to try try to understand why
(37:00) this is analogous because you're saying to me that genders and idty no but you keep saying what I think and I and I
(37:05) don't think that because I don't really like from you just said gender is an a form of
(37:11) identity yes self idut so it's self ID self ID is that like a yes it's how
(37:18) you identify yourself that's what gender is okay so how come race which is a form
(37:23) of social construction is also not interchangeable as a self
(37:29) ID because I don't think that people of different races um have any you know gen
(37:34) generally like intrinsic uh differences outside of cultural ones of
(37:40) course yeah so so then so then if that's true why couldn't you just identify as
(37:46) being that race because it makes you feel better and be treated as though you're that race I mean you could that'd be just I just don't know what the
(37:52) treatment would be different you if you wanted to identify
(37:57) is black what do you think how the treatment so here's how your is because you want to say the N word or what like
(38:02) how would it how would it change it would be completely different you the things that you could qualify for uh
(38:08) from the state would be totally different affirmative action would be totally different all of these things would be totally different the same as
(38:14) if you I in your case you say if you identify as a woman you can go into Nina don't ask me a question and then two
(38:21) seconds into the answer you cut in just relax a second same thing as if a woman
(38:27) uh or man decides he wants to go into women's locker rooms and self IDs as a man suddenly has the extended courtesy
(38:34) that he can just go and shower with women and this kind of thing okay so you're saying that hey none of that
(38:39) matters it's all just a conceptualization of self-identity it's like well obviously it's not just a
(38:45) conceptualization of self-identity because if that's the case then you'd have to bite the bullet on
(38:52) Race uh I don't feel like I'd have to do that because Okay so can get affirmative
(38:58) action if he walks around in blackface Nina can he get can he get affirmative action if he puts on blackface and gives
(39:04) himself cord Rose and say actually that's that's an interesting point to bring up because does Alex
(39:11) identify as black let's just let's play into what you're you're saying does he identify as black yeah but let's assume he
(39:19) did okay but does he no I'm sure he doesn't but who cares okay then so it
(39:24) doesn't really track I I identify as Asian actually okay but sure I think that's what a lot
(39:31) of people like you guys like up a little bit with operating within the the world of he he is though he is for the sake of
(39:38) this hypothetical we're just going to assume that he is right but what I'm saying is like I think that there's a
(39:44) lot of subtlety there with if you're really going to talk about like it depends like I'm half I'm half Japanese and I'm half white like I could maybe
(39:52) identify more with one side I identify more with my white side like
(39:58) how do you feel about that like is that like something that doesn't track like consistently like I it does level it
(40:06) really matters that her Point well she when she when she says do you think when
(40:12) she says do you think X that's a question right can you answer the question yeah so that both those things are pointing to biological structures
(40:20) right you are white and biological okay so do you think that people are
(40:25) significantly biologically different this same way that men and women are biologically different um of being
(40:30) different races I think that the significant standards are relevant that there if you're just going off of like a
(40:36) racial construction of certain clusters of people look very similar and therefore they're treated in certain ways due to the similar looking or
(40:43) whatever and this you're trying to relate that to you're trying to relate that to to race right I'm trying to just
(40:49) Rel F where you're at with this just relating it to self ID so in this case you just self-identified as half
(40:56) Japanese half white you don't believe that these are intr intrinsic biological categories but rather they're social categories
(41:04) correct uh sure yeah okay so then if that's true and these these aren't
(41:10) biological categories are just completely made up Social constructions why can't you identify as
(41:18) black well I just I don't really know what would the reason to this is why I'm saying like you need to know the reason
(41:24) behind it like I don't like if you grew up around like again like in a in a very black community you could identify with
(41:29) that particular group um significantly more but it's not going to change your skin color so like if we're talking
(41:34) about things like Element no no no if we're talking about things like like reparations and stuff like that um what
(41:40) we need to be addressing here is why were those things put in place why was affirmative action put in place it was
(41:45) not to directly like oh because your melanin level is a certain level that you just get this like um this Branch or
(41:51) whatever what we're really talking about is oh how were these people's ancestors treated right and I think that as we go
(41:59) on um this thing will not be as important as it is to to be racially divided in the ways that we are right
(42:05) now but um I think that what you're getting caught up on is like the these structures that already exist um for
(42:13) example like and again I I have mixed feelings on affirmative action we can absolutely talk about that if um uh if
(42:19) you want to um uh assuming Alex is okay with that but I just I have very complicated uh opinions on that as well
(42:26) but I I I don't think that these this tracks directly oneon-one here when it
(42:31) comes to to to to sex and gender because I think that when we really talk about
(42:39) like race like what is being black mean what is being white mean like those then do become like a very socialized thing
(42:46) which I think you're trying to get at with this and that's fair um but I think that they're the subtle you're trying to
(42:51) be very simplistic about like oh you're all of a sudden going to be like oh he can just like say the end word like what
(42:57) is identifying as black mean right okay so that's I think that's
(43:03) a fair question kind of but let me just dive into it so that you understand right if you want to get into kind of
(43:09) these Nuance distinctions so let's start with is thing X possible okay so you
(43:17) would you agree that it's possible for Alex to put on blackface and identify as being a black
(43:23) man um it is possible for him to put on black face yes and pretend to be a black
(43:29) man right is identifying and pretending I I think those things are actually completely different okay fair enough so
(43:34) he can identify as then being a black man right Sor so he can identify as being a
(43:41) black man right um sure so the question is does
(43:46) that make him one does that make him a black person again that really is again what I'm
(43:53) talking about subtleties is what what black person
(43:58) uh who very light is a light-skinned person um a very like somebody who looks
(44:04) like Alex for example who is half black is that person still black I think that socially they would
(44:11) be considered black you sure you think socially that they would be considered black so the way that
(44:18) people would react to them was that they would just know that he was black yeah but I think that you have the case of
(44:23) Barack Obama to kind of fortify what I'm saying I'm saying that he looked like Alex is Alex so now answer my question
(44:30) so now answer my question now that I've answered yours as you pivoted twice Alex if he puts on black face and identify as
(44:37) black you said he can do that my follow-up question is does it make him
(44:42) black okay but no this is what you're you're losing here okay answer the question being is somebody you answer no
(44:52) no you did not answer you did not answer my question if somebody so if somebody who looks like Alex is
(45:01) you know black or whatever is is so what what is your level of what is black is
(45:06) it just like the skin color is it the the uh the history like your like your ancestors like what do you think black
(45:14) is I think black is how we perceive a a a skin color of people who largely come
(45:19) from the subsaharan African region in the United States that's what we call okay so then he would not be considered black because
(45:27) you black just me who cares who cares I'm asking you no that's incred no no no no no that's incredibly important so
(45:33) you're saying that black just means a skin color no he's not saying that okay
(45:39) he said he literally just said that means that you have a skin tone that is Subs hair in Africa when when you're
(45:45) when you're ready now now that I've just answered multiple more questions of yours can we go back to mine did you
(45:52) just say that let me one more time I think that we associate black in the United States as individuals who you can
(45:59) largely identify as likely coming from the subsaharan African region just due
(46:05) to their physiological externalities so you would not consider Alex someone who looked like Alex who's
(46:12) like half black to be a black then he's not half what are you talking about I'm
(46:17) saying if somebody looked like Alex right yeah they probably wouldn't be considered black yes in in my
(46:24) framework or in socially uh in and social framework of course not now back to my question now that I've asked now
(46:31) that I've answered all of yours one more time back to my question you agree that Alex can put on black face and identify
(46:38) as being black I'm GNA ask you again is does that make him black in Nina's
(46:43) worldview would that make him laugh if your okay right that's why I wanted to establish this because in your view who
(46:49) cares about my view for the 300th time I've already explained it now on to you answer my question you're you're not
(46:55) wait why why is opinion matter in this like what do you mean if if when you say
(47:00) black right you mean uh people who physically look black then no if Alex
(47:08) put on black face and said that he was black um it would really depend I guess
(47:14) on the quality of it like if you're if that's like your your primary level of like what is black like then on your uh
(47:21) assessment of that then I guess yes but that's because that's your
(47:27) is skin T I'm Nina's world viiew for the 300th time I just want an answer
(47:33) to you didn't ask me what and I answered and I did ask you I've asked you six times I'm gonna ask you again if Alex
(47:40) goes in blackface if he puts on blackface and he says he's black is that
(47:45) a true statement or not in Nina's worldview that a true statement what do you mean by a true statement like again
(47:51) like you're just like being so nebulous and everything you're saying a true statement about what like like that he is all of a sudden black and in your
(47:57) world viiew yes in my world view melanin yeah because all you said was that it was
(48:02) melanin he's asking about your world viiew okay but then we have to establish
(48:08) the conversation of what like Blackness is and I think that's like again tell
(48:13) what it is um that's an interesting uh conversation around that what blackface
(48:20) is generally related to uh is is what I think about is like the minstral shows of making fun of an under class
(48:29) so so wh be black just as long as they're in the
(48:34) underclass whites can be blacks in or is there something hisorical right I understand
(48:40) for example like when we're talking about like why are things like reparations a conversation why are things like affirmative action a
(48:45) conversation it is because of the uh historical injustices that have been made on histor uh uh historically like
(48:52) you know like we're talking about black like African origin um uh people um that
(48:58) were like slaved it really depends what we're talking in America right in America we are very much talking about
(49:04) like people who had um Origins to like to slave ownership and then also like obviously the conversation about Jim
(49:10) Crow all of that like the injustices like things like affirmative action which again interesting conversation to have is related to um like making up for
(49:19) the wrongs that we had made in the past as a country like again as somebody who
(49:25) is Japanese the wrong that happened to my family that the country made up for
(49:31) was obviously the internment it doesn't mean that Japanese people coming in after the war would get like the
(49:36) reparations but the the systems that have been in implemented um at that time
(49:42) like uh with uh you know we're talking about like again affirmative action um when it has to relate to to like former
(49:51) uh like the in that were happening with uh which is why I have such a complic
(49:56) relationship with how I feel about affirmative action because I think that it's kind of gotten all as a moderator
(50:04) no no don't step in Let Her Go trust me I'll bring it back around go ahead just bring it back around oh my God you love
(50:12) just cutting me off I didn't C you I didn't cut I want you guys to bring your back around because this is just now game I'll bring
(50:18) it I'll bring it back around I promise let her finish all right go ahead sure okay um God damn it I [ __ ] get hate
(50:25) getting cut off whatever just do it you were talking about how Blackness is more of an less of an indication of skin
(50:31) color and uh the social perception and it's more of a shared lived experience
(50:37) based on a uh specific demographic experience in history that's where you
(50:42) were at specific demographic no I'm say like the the anchest I was specifically
(50:48) talking about how that we were talking uh related to affirmative action as an aspect of like something that could be
(50:53) taken advantage of because I don't think that that NE necessarily is something that we can relate to gender because
(50:59) it's like so complicated in a way that um the history
(51:05) is like it's not the same as in like oh like what uh you you could say about
(51:12) like the history of like gender expression you know like there isn't like like white people weren't really
(51:18) like like Germans weren't considered white right for a while and then they were because what it represents is to an
(51:26) extent like a underclass um specifically when we're talking about
(51:31) America that's where a lot of that comes from like the one drop rule for example you know what that is
(51:36) right yeah get to get to your point like I'm trying trying to just wait for you to get to your point I've been very
(51:43) patiently waiting for you to get to your point okay right but my like entire point of when your question was related
(51:49) to like oh can he be can you like identify as black right um if he had
(51:56) like obviously like a historical relation to that Community even though he appears white that like yeah sure he
(52:04) he could but my problem is the black space aspect where I don't understand
(52:09) why that would be a part of the uh racial identity like cuz because he
(52:16) wouldn't have to change his physical appearance right if he did identify with his black roots you understand what I'm
(52:23) saying so if this is true and you're saying that these specific groups need
(52:29) to be isolated in order to get reparations how are we going to isolate the groups we would isolate them based
(52:36) on their physiology that's how we do it so if you want to know which group belongs in the camp whose ancestors were
(52:43) persecuted and enslaved there's a really easy tell for that and the easy tell for
(52:49) that is their biological externalities in your particular case you're saying if you want to apply for reparations or you
(52:55) want to have some type of group reparations uh for things that have happened in the past you have to have
(53:02) some type of biological claim to that group that's what you're saying I think that that's completely true and the same
(53:10) thing would apply with men and women when it came to transexuality that you cannot adopt the
(53:16) identity of women as men because you do not have the required biological makeup
(53:22) that would put you in that group so that you could be extended those courtesies so in other words you don't get to have
(53:29) the same type of Oppression Olympics as a man who dresses up like a woman as you do as a biological woman because you
(53:35) don't share the same history do you understand now you said oppression Olympics what
(53:41) ises that I don't really think that made sense in the context of what you're talking about what I'm saying to you
(53:47) specifically is that if your claim is that you have to be a part biologically
(53:52) of a group in order to be isolated to be considered for these things like reparations then you're pointing at Alex and saying
(53:59) Alex simply putting on blackface wouldn't be enough because he'd have to share the history of struggle and the history of ancestry and all this other
(54:06) stuff okay fair enough then why would you extend the same courtesy to men who dress up as women and pretend that they
(54:12) share the same struggles that women shared have the same shared history as women have the same biological claim to
(54:18) Womanhood that's insane that doesn't make any sense holy [ __ ] like that's like saying like oh
(54:25) because like you have a like that we're talking about
(54:31) the okay but I just don't even understand how you got that from what I was saying you're saying that like okay
(54:36) so what else can't he be black other than a shared history it's not like every single human being is like mixed
(54:43) race my guy every single human being is both part like of made from like a
(54:48) female or a male or you know obviously the INX that can be involved in that as well but like that's that doesn't make
(54:55) any sense of what you're trying to use that perfect sense then tell me why Alex can't be
(55:02) black uh I don't know Alex are black it's irrelevant let's assume for a
(55:08) second he identifies as being black hypothal identifies as being black are you going to say he industry and maybe
(55:15) he like his white he might identify with being black That's my boy he doesn't he
(55:20) doesn't assuming he doesn't have any shared history no shared anything he doesn't a single drop of biological DNA
(55:29) from let me finish he has not a single drop of this of blood from the
(55:35) subsaharan African region okay let's just say everything from Alex's family for the sake of this hypothetical comes
(55:42) from Scotland right doesn't matter where it comes from okay but he doesn't share any genealogy whatsoever with subsaharan
(55:50) Africans okay can you explain to me if he puts on blackface and identifies as
(55:56) being black why he's not or can't
(56:01) you why he's not or can't you um I see I mean like can he or can he not like yeah
(56:08) of course you can do that I just don't know why you would like what would the
(56:13) point of that be would he be black at that point black
(56:18) Yes again this is where I went into the definitions of that
(56:24) um what level of what level of consideration talk Talking if black is genetic relations to
(56:31) that then no you're under your worldview nina not my
(56:37) worldview what under your worldview your Nina's World we're in Nina's worldview
(56:43) now I've already explained my worldview you can critique it all you want I'm fine with that but just answer my
(56:49) question the same page answer my question from Nina's worldview from what nah thinks in Nina's [ __ ] brain if
(56:55) Alex puts on black face and he claims that he's put on okay it doesn't make you black
(57:03) awesome black face does not make you black yes okay so Alex if he identifies as being a black man and put on blackace
(57:10) would not be telling the truth right um that he identifies as it or
(57:17) that he like he is it that he is it is that he is that thing but that's why I'm
(57:24) saying that when it comes to like what's important of what you're def let me just let me okay I'm gonna clear this up because we
(57:31) been going circles for half an hour okay the hypothetical that I think Andrew's trying to Cree this let's say that I identify as black I have zero black
(57:37) ancestry zero anything like that I put on black face I start dropping the end bomb I start applying for like
(57:42) affirmative action type of [ __ ] okay but why would you do that let's let's say I want to let's say I really want to be black and I just want to do it right and
(57:49) I identify and identifies maybe I feel way more in in common with the Black Culture maybe I
(57:54) love rap maybe I love like everything about Black Culture right would that in your world viiew uh make me black and if
(58:01) not uh if I do say I'm black am I telling the truth or am I lying that's the
(58:07) question answer question somebody that you're list she can't answer the question and collapses her worldview
(58:13) Alex she it can't be it it it's G to be impossible like to get Nina to answer so
(58:18) just say yes or no nina yes or no I literally just said no no he can't be black so then he would be lying if he
(58:25) made made the statement that he was that he's not black um that he was black um I
(58:32) would assume I guess sure okay so if that's true then we can apply this to
(58:38) gender now and tell me why it is that a man who's saying that they a woman is telling the
(58:45) truth what do you mean are they saying that they are able like like that they're a biological female or are they
(58:51) saying that they're a woman a woman is biological female that's what people associate with woman
(58:58) okay but this is where we have the gender conversation here yeah but this is this is exactly applicable to the
(59:04) conversation we just had before my contention is that they're lying they're lying because they can't they can't be
(59:11) those things based on both biology and the social makeup of who we would put
(59:16) inside of those groups due to their biological struggle under Nina's worldview so they can't be telling the
(59:22) truth Nina Okay so
(59:27) what do you would you say that um if if you're so like upset about that
(59:34) phrasing for some reason of like thinking that uh women just means biological female what do you think of
(59:39) the the term transwoman well transwoman indicates men
(59:45) who have a mental illness called gender
(59:53) dysphoria the what okay like what do you mean so you're you're okay with uh the term transwoman if it's to describe if
(1:00:00) the descriptor of transwoman is not to describe a biological female but rather
(1:00:06) to describe males who have a mental illness uh which makes them just like
(1:00:13) want to pretend to be females then I'm fine I'm fine with using that terminology but the second you try to
(1:00:19) Interchange it and say that they're women they still be women then right no they wouldn't be women they'd be trans
(1:00:24) so but right be trans women that was black women not women black okay so
(1:00:30) first of all you don't need the additional descriptor so black women are just women you're just woman all females
(1:00:38) are just woman all trans women would indicate the people who do not have the biological functionality to be
(1:00:45) considered adult human females descri okay so just what about a
(1:00:52) [Music] um a firewoman M what's a fir
(1:00:59) woman like like a woman who's a firefighter yeah okay so if you were
(1:01:05) going to say um you know for the purpose of the conversation women who are
(1:01:10) biological females who are also firefighters we call them fire women I'm fine with
(1:01:16) that okay so you are okay with the term then like trans women as long as the descriptor of it is
(1:01:23) describing this specific phenomenon of a mental illness called gender dysphoria I'm fine with it okay so you're just
(1:01:30) really married to the term the mental illness aspect of it you know I think that's fine I think we'll take that from you that's that's as Progressive as I
(1:01:36) think we're ever going to get you um but I think that's actually interesting thing that you're willing to um engage
(1:01:44) in that I think but they're not women they're men but why do you call them
(1:01:49) women then I'm not calling them women you're calling but you're you're calling them trans women right I say the word trans if if if they make the delineation
(1:01:57) and transwoman becomes synonymous with man with mental illness male with mental
(1:02:02) illness instead of I am biological female I'm fine with that distinction
(1:02:09) yes transwoman is synonymous with male with mental illness do you think that transwoman then is synonymous with male
(1:02:16) with mental illness my personal definition of that um I I don't think that being trans mental illness no but I
(1:02:22) think that that's okay that people can see it that way um if we're going to
(1:02:28) make you know some progress with that because I think there are elements of what is considered mental illness that
(1:02:33) we can go into whatever like having um I mean there there is a lot of subtle
(1:02:38) conversation about transness that like like non-binary people could also be considered you know trans so curious on
(1:02:45) you it doesn't mean anything it's just made up made up tribe does me binary yeah it means nothing it doesn't mean
(1:02:52) anything so maybe I should ask meaningless label it's a meaningless label would you be offended if I called
(1:02:58) you she yeah well that would be a false statement so it wouldn't be an indicator
(1:03:04) of Truth okay why because you when you say
(1:03:09) she you're referencing an adult human female as opposed to an adult human male which would be he the reason that those
(1:03:16) distinctions are made is so that we don't we don't make false wouldn't like being
(1:03:22) misgendered well it's not a misgendering it's it it's more it's actually uh far
(1:03:28) simpler than that it's a descriptor which is inaccurate because it's a lie
(1:03:34) it's a it's a descriptor which is inaccurate because it's not indicating truth there's no truth that it's
(1:03:39) indicating so it would be inappropriate to use it it'd be like if I said Nina that guy that guy nah is super weird
(1:03:46) that guy's [ __ ] dumb right that makes no sense because the indication there is that you're male which isn't true it's
(1:03:53) obviously not true okay but as somebody who identifies as non binary I don't
(1:03:58) care you could absolutely say that but but but the Nuance here where you [ __ ]
(1:04:04) yourself is you said that a simple as self-identification with an empty label
(1:04:09) isn't enough there has to be an indication of some sort of actual physical reality which goes in in with
(1:04:15) it otherwise you would be able well you actually had to concede that that's what the black question was about but we're
(1:04:22) not talking about I know we're not talking about it directly but it's analogous across the board Nina so it
(1:04:28) would be inaccurate for me to say that and if you say I'm be because if you say that in that
(1:04:35) people group The the indication there that Alex can't be black is based on the
(1:04:40) fact that he doesn't have the requirements biologically nor socially to be black and so you don't have the
(1:04:47) requirements biologically or so or socially to be a male you don't have those requirements so me calling you a
(1:04:54) descriptor in IND indicating your male would be inaccurate how do you know I'm
(1:05:00) not a trans woman because You' publicly stated you're
(1:05:08) not together on that one yeah okay well G Nina do you have a
(1:05:16) penis does it matter what I say do it matters one's a lie and one's the truth
(1:05:21) Okay but well let me ask you this are you a liar
(1:05:26) uh sometimes sometimes you lie so should I even take anything you say should I
(1:05:32) take anything you say at face value are you GNA lie it doesn't matter like you're just do you just assume that I don't or
(1:05:38) what yeah we're able to make um societal assumptions based on just like we could make the the social assumption that Alex
(1:05:44) isn't black there's a reason for okay have you ever seen a really Butch lesbian I have
(1:05:51) yeah do you think that the fact that um a lot of like women get like or a lot of
(1:05:57) Butch lesbians are get like harassed in women's bathrooms because they think they're trans women does that by a lot
(1:06:04) you mean almost none ever is that what you mean by a lot almost none ever if we're talking about like statistically yes a very small amount yeah very very
(1:06:11) very small am okay but it doesn't it doesn't matter the point is that like it's indicative of the fact that you you probably can't really
(1:06:17) tell right there can be certain instances where a magician's trick can
(1:06:23) trick the eye or where a person eye can be tricked where they can't tell there can be instances of that yes but that
(1:06:30) really doesn't mean anything there could be an instance for instance where you had black men who did a movie called
(1:06:36) white girls and they dressed up like white girls for the purpose of this movie and the special effects were so
(1:06:42) realistic that it's possible that they were walking down the street and were treated like white girls it's
(1:06:49) possible because it happened that actually happened right it happened to comedian were dressed up
(1:06:57) women no I am I I am familiar with the movie Yes I
(1:07:02) just how do you not understand that the expression that we show of ourselves is
(1:07:09) indicative like when you like say she her he whatever like are you seeing
(1:07:15) their dicks or [ __ ] like when you say it like I I don't understand like how of course we make the of course we make the
(1:07:21) association with that because it's biological only way that you want to breed with women because they no but are
(1:07:29) you on the street and you're just in like a store right and you're just like walking down the aisle here are you and
(1:07:37) you see somebody who like is presenting very very uh feminine like do you really
(1:07:45) know you can be biological you you can be tricked the same way that a black
(1:07:51) person who who looks exactly like a white person because put on all sorts of
(1:07:56) makeup and Hollywood special effects that can trick your eye but it's not an indication of Truth you think it's not
(1:08:04) indicating what's true yeah I just gave you an example of that it's rare but so is the phenomenon you're talking talking
(1:08:10) no you're talking about a movie my guy we're not talking about like what do you what do you mean who cares like the
(1:08:16) reason why that they're doing that in the movie is because they're filming a movie if somebody is a trans woman it's
(1:08:22) that they identify with and want to be perceived as a woman right so they want to present a nonr state they want to
(1:08:29) present a non-true statement to get you to trick your mind into believing they's something they're not just like those
(1:08:35) movie goers did just like the movie Producers did there's no difference There's no distinction okay how is how
(1:08:42) what did they get out of it let me let me they have a mental illness they have a mental illness they you can't apply
(1:08:51) reason to people who are mentally ill because they're mentally ill you don't have any reason to believe that you're
(1:08:56) just saying that they are mentally ill it seems like you're kind of mentally ill that you just think people are
(1:09:01) trying to Ill the dsm5 calls people with gender dysphoria mentally ill not me
(1:09:06) it's considered a mental illness they're not like considered like needing to be that's right it's considered a mentally a mental illness yeah that can be
(1:09:12) treated with a gender affirming care right so lying to
(1:09:18) them lying to them that's horable well so let's let's turn it around then if that's not so you think like somebody
(1:09:24) who has a mental illness Cas let's find out if you're telling the truth or if I'm telling the truth if the DSM put in
(1:09:30) a prescription saying that people who struggle with racial dysphoria let's say in this case Alex in blackface um I
(1:09:38) don't I'm not I'm not dealing with this treat best talk and that the best
(1:09:44) treatment for him was for us to affirm his race even though it might upset everybody else in the black community
(1:09:51) should we do that um is it statistically going to lower the uh significant amount of like
(1:09:57) suicide rights absolutely oh I would consider it sure we'd have to know the facts on that you
(1:10:03) would consider affirming it even though it upset every black person on planet Earth who says that person do you're
(1:10:11) you're the one that gets upset about trans people I don't care about your opinion I want trans people to have [ __ ] Healthcare okay because it makes
(1:10:17) them feel better and it doesn't affect you well hang on in this talking about blackace is that obviously has racial
(1:10:23) undertones do you think that that is the when it to gender affirming care racial undertones do you think that the N word
(1:10:30) has the same effect of other slurs it has sex undertone so the thing is is that you want sex undertone so a
(1:10:35) historical uh interpretation do you want Christians
(1:10:41) are the overwhelming majority of the United States and you're asking them to lie in order to make people feel
(1:10:48) better but you would take you would take do you understand that Christianity is a lie you would take black people's
(1:10:54) feeling is a matter religion is a [ __ ] lie dude whether you think it's a lie or not
(1:11:01) we're just operating off of feelings here they're not against uh against trans people so I don't know what you're
(1:11:06) talking about so yes well I mean yes they are but I don't know what you're talking about but anyway back back to
(1:11:11) what I was saying you would take the entire consideration of the black community into account and say it does
(1:11:18) actually more damage to affirm Alex's identity as a black man if it causes more harm to the entire black community
(1:11:24) but in the case of a Christian person you would say that's fine [ __ ] them they're Liars
(1:11:30) anyway um does it does do trans people people affect the Christian
(1:11:36) Community yes I just told you we have to lie expectation is that we lie yeah
(1:11:41) that's very harmful to people there's it's harmful to people who are so you
(1:11:48) think Christians having to lie is the same as blackace the black community I think that the ask that a person says
(1:11:54) something which is not true has the same ramifications on both communities yes
(1:11:59) because that's what you're doing in both cases okay so so yes just say yes that you you agree straight up that blackface
(1:12:07) is as bad as asking Christians to lie you know there's a lot of other things 100% believe that that's true is that
(1:12:13) your same opinion on like abortion or some [ __ ] like that's insane no well
(1:12:18) just asserting that it's insane isn't an argument okay so why don't you um go in
(1:12:24) on so why is asking to like let's assume that it's a lie or whatever so um how is
(1:12:33) lying the same level to Christians as Black Faces to the black community
(1:12:38) because both in both instances it's simply an emotional response based on something that's not true so they're directly blackface was
(1:12:47) like minstral shows and stuff like you understand what Minal literally making fun of do you
(1:12:52) understand in this black community we're talking about Alex pretending to be black and you affirming his
(1:13:00) [Music] Blackness you affirming his Blackness because it it will help him with like
(1:13:06) suicidality issues that's what we're talking about so if that's the case right you're saying it's okay to lie to
(1:13:12) Alex and affirm his identity as a black man in order to prevent him from from
(1:13:18) suicidality it's like okay that's fine if you say that and you'll disenfranchise every other black person
(1:13:24) who says no that that actually hurts us right but you wouldn't give the same AFF foration to Christians who say we're not
(1:13:30) going to lie and call men women who put on a wig and have a giant [ __ ] beard women that's
(1:13:35) insane I don't think that most uh trans women probably want to do that that's more of an NB thing again like I don't
(1:13:42) think you understand the aties of gender identity and that's fine
(1:13:47) that's for my I just don't understand what you're talking about no I just don't think like it's not like you're
(1:13:52) dumb or something I don't think you're a dumb person I just think that it's like more um like I think you're really like
(1:13:58) in the in the camp of wanting to make these things black and white and I think that's really un unhelpful opinion to
(1:14:05) have like just for yourself even like I mean you have multiple children what if one of them was trans would would you
(1:14:10) how would you feel about that they can't be trans it's an indic they can only have a mental illness that's it there's
(1:14:16) no such thing as trans mental illness okay so if the Sol okay so if they have a a mental illness right that makes them
(1:14:24) maybe vulnerable to like committing suicide right um and you had a solution
(1:14:30) to make sure that didn't happen would you not want to see that happen for your child I think that I would do whatever I
(1:14:38) could to mitigate their health not at the expense of whatever my personal
(1:14:43) values were so would I do anything the answer be values forance for instance if what if they were a psychopathic serial
(1:14:49) killer and it made him feel better to kill people okay but that's not what we talking about right but hang on should I let them do that the answer would be no
(1:14:56) because it would be a contradiction in values so if they said the only way that you can actually help your son through
(1:15:02) this mental illness is to affirm a lie in in contradiction to your own values would I do that the answer is also
(1:15:10) no okay so you're saying if you if if your child was trans and they were
(1:15:17) really upset that you would not accept if they had a mental illness I'm no I'm just no I'm asking you like just
(1:15:23) a straight like okay if you think of that that's mental illness that's fine let's go with that that's fine I don't see any problem with any way possible
(1:15:29) that was not contrary to my Christian values yes okay but what if statistically well there's not anything
(1:15:36) against in Christianity transable yeah lying is lying is bad in Christianity Nina I don't know if you knew that or
(1:15:42) not but we're not allowed to do that it's a sin okay I don't really want to engage with the lying aspect because I feel
(1:15:48) like that's very but youve already you already have so so if you have the choice of affirming your Christian
(1:15:54) values and your kiding yourself you're going to go with a kid killing yourself or themselves you mean if there was a
(1:16:01) direct like you have to violate the sanctity of all of your values or this kid dies depending on the mortality of
(1:16:07) the sin I just don't think that's not much of a okay so the mortality of the one of your kid lies like that's the
(1:16:14) that's you violating the sanctity of all of your values just like lying about anything yeah lying lying is a sin yes
(1:16:21) now there's a hierarchy when it comes to when it comes to not all sins are are equal you know so is it possible that I
(1:16:28) might is it possible that in my own selfishness I might set some of those sins aside for my Prodigy in order to do
(1:16:36) uh something different than is W within my value structure even knowing that it's wrong I might I might do that but
(1:16:43) that mean it's right to do okay that's fair but you would you would be willing to do that if if the
(1:16:49) LIE cuz I I mean lying is not like a on not on that high level
(1:16:55) the yeah I think that the magn is worse is worse uh often than
(1:17:02) just killing someone lies can enslave an entire population lies can convince people that men can be women lies can
(1:17:09) convince all SS of M okay so in your mind how how high is
(1:17:15) the the trans life for you what level is it like the genocide that's a complete that's a complete rewrite of reality so
(1:17:23) it's it's a it's a socially controlled lie so it's it's high up there it's a it's a very awful and horrendous lie
(1:17:31) that has been perpetuated on the public to state that women the essence that is
(1:17:38) woman which is its own unique thing under God it's its own unique thing is
(1:17:45) perverse to the point where men can just make the claim that they're interchangeable with a thing that gives
(1:17:51) life to other men is a horrendous lie it's horr horrendous
(1:17:57) horrendous why I just told you why it's because it's a reite of the fabric of of all
(1:18:04) things that are true you're just kind of saying like Grand claims you're not really giving me an example how do youed
(1:18:11) off my belief in Jesus Christ and my religion and the affirmation of that
(1:18:17) belief if you have if you have problems with that and you want to get into transcendentals and get worked there too
(1:18:22) Nina we can do that too what whatever you want to do if you want to question my value structure comp religion
(1:18:28) something that doesn't have any basis in anything yeah I'm sure that I don't want to get religion let's keep it on topic
(1:18:34) okay so here on topic what I'm saying is that yes the affirmation of what's true is very important to Christians there
(1:18:40) are Christians who lie of course nobody is perfect okay and of course certain
(1:18:46) lies have a magnitude greater than others in their effect we're not [ __ ] we understand the distinctions
(1:18:52) here nah what I'm saying is that if you if you make this radical claim that men
(1:18:58) and women are interchangeable that is such a wild claim that you need to present overwhelming evidence that
(1:19:04) that's true and all you have is that it's an empty label of a self ID which
(1:19:09) is [ __ ] pathetic it's pathetic do you think that all men are interchangeable of course no there's a
(1:19:16) separation between what makes me me and what makes Alex Alex okay so why did you say
(1:19:23) interchangeable in that context because you believe that men and women are interchangeable widgets and they're not
(1:19:28) they're not interchangeable widgets you do like to say that I don't think I've ever even said the word widget I had to affir First debate I can give you the
(1:19:35) time stamp I'll have l pull it up right now and we can play it live if you sure that's fine but you did say sure your
(1:19:42) word choice doesn't mean that I go against or absolutely agree with
(1:19:47) everything you said it's like you're kind of trying to do like a very weird gocha
(1:19:52) but would I get a little confused at when you're saying
(1:19:58) like I know we've had this conversation or I'm not sure if I had it with you but you know who Buck Angel is
(1:20:04) right I do I know another guy named Buck Angel gper but I won't get into that
(1:20:10) yeah go ahead go ahead you want to make like the The Buck Angel Blair white comparison right can do that I still
(1:20:17) want to have that okay so if anyone doesn't know who Buck Angel is you can just go with he's a very jacked man but
(1:20:23) to The Mind's Eye right like and like just seeing them on the street you're going to assume that he's a man because
(1:20:30) that's the utility of things like gender right where it doesn't really matter um
(1:20:37) what their sex is it's just how they're presenting MH um so what is
(1:20:43) your so you say you say Andrew if you saw Buck Angel graper would you or Buck Angel sorry not Buck Angel graper funny
(1:20:49) asess with the graper I'm a little wor if you think if you think uh Buck Angel right uh would I would I instantly
(1:20:56) assume that that's a man right the answer would be yes but so what my eye can be tricked just like a
(1:21:03) magician can so I'll give you a counter example if I pulled right if I pulled up right now hang on if I pulled up right
(1:21:09) now six pictures of Labrador retrievers could you tell me which of them were females and which of them were
(1:21:16) males I don't know maybe probably not could you do it like honestly could you
(1:21:21) just could you tell me which ones are males and which ones are female Labrador rever uh certain dogs have like
(1:21:27) different aspects of it but for the reason of just not being annoying um as know no right you can't so the thing is
(1:21:35) is the reason that you can't is the same reason that my eye can be tricked at times it doesn't indicate I'm making a
(1:21:41) truth claim wait you're going to relate gender does mean I'm making a truth claim right doesn't mean that when I say
(1:21:48) that Buck Angel that I my perception was tricked and I thought that that was a man that that actually is a man anymore
(1:21:55) than the labrador retriever right that you see it just like you just see their
(1:22:00) head or you just see their body or whatever you can assume hey that could be a male or a female you don't know
(1:22:06) relationally you can be tricked do you understand that like you you're that your mind can be tricked but that that
(1:22:12) doesn't mean it's true okay but the fact that your mind is tricked does that not seem to make it
(1:22:19) seem that you know what general phenotype phenotypical characteristics
(1:22:25) are related to what you assume is a woman how it's being tricked just the same the same way that a person can make
(1:22:31) a quarter disappear cut a person in half in front of you you understand intuitively that a saw cutting through a
(1:22:38) person would kill them so you're oo in odd when they pull the thing apart and this person is cut in half but they're
(1:22:44) not dead you call it witchcraft when you're like watching a magician like who gives that it's a trick I mean
(1:22:50) everything is supposed to be like a I mean do you think makeup is Trick did you do you think
(1:22:57) that you of course it is makeup is designed to enhance makeup is designed to
(1:23:06) sexuality then why do you wear it and do you think hiding like a it that's like really prominent why do you wear it I
(1:23:13) think hiding is it that's like prominent is the same as like wanting to like get
(1:23:18) [ __ ] I'll tell you what I'll tell you what you know what if it's not about sexuality and how you're perceived by other people Nina go take off your
(1:23:24) makeup and come back to the camera I'll wait why because you think I'm wearing right now because I let's see what you
(1:23:30) really look like go go take off your makeup and ship back down care you're not gonna be in B then go do it I'll
(1:23:36) take take your time go do it okay but the reason I'm wearing makeup is not for that purpose what is the purpose why
(1:23:42) would I do that what is the purpose because I think it makes you look cool well you think that it makes you point
(1:23:48) like you wearing this nice you got a nice haircut you got a nice shirt why the reason you doing that are you trying to like hit on uh Alex hair or what no
(1:23:55) men do things for socially different reasons than women do okay you notice that I'm not wearing makeup I'm not
(1:24:01) wearing makeup right oh wait so are we talking about men wearing makeup or just women wearing makeup well women are the ones who wear
(1:24:08) makeup they're trying to hide their age they're trying to wear makeup they're trying to enhance sex appeal things like
(1:24:14) that yeah sometimes they do it for similar reasons but overwhelmingly women do it for these
(1:24:20) purposes so go take off your makeup you're not going to embarrassed it doesn't even matter Nita go take off
(1:24:26) your makeup I just don't want to do that I don't have to even get up I have a thing I'm sure I'm sure you don't I'm sure you don't but the thing is your
(1:24:32) dunk that like oh take off your makeup like I don't care no my I'm not even wearing face make I'm not even wearing that much makeup my guy like what the
(1:24:38) [ __ ] are you talking about consider you're wearing makeup my dunk is simple it's just to say that the indication of
(1:24:45) the things in which you point to are most often not true one of the things which one are often not true yeah that
(1:24:50) was like absolute non-st mod it was you're calling me a li yeah yeah that's true you do like to do
(1:24:58) that only when you're not telling the truth only when you're not telling the truth okay okay oh I wonder how much
(1:25:05) gaslighting you do to Rachel my guy like it's a little worrisome do you get mad when she wears makeup outside no of
(1:25:12) course not I think I [ __ ] up my focus but she's just trying why because she would be honest in the statement that
(1:25:19) the reason that she's wearing it perhaps is to appear younger or to appear better or to
(1:25:26) that was to make a personification of a thing well when you're talking about sex appeal is very important for
(1:25:31) women okay but is that is to okay so she's wearing it for sex appeal I think
(1:25:38) sometimes sure especially for me and you're um okay what do you mean sometimes it kind of seems like it's an
(1:25:43) all or nothing there with the way you explain it well I don't think always it's being used for the purpose of sex appeal but I think it's always being
(1:25:49) used to hide some sort of reality yes
(1:25:54) um I'm okay with that I think it's fine like if you were gonna hide a zit I might hide a zit I think that that's
(1:26:00) fine okay but I'm but the thing is is like all you have to do is make the indication of what's real that's all I'm
(1:26:07) asking you to do the reason I think you're a liar is because every time I point to a truth statement of something
(1:26:12) that's real your instant knee-jerk reaction is to tell me no actually you're wrong and this is none of this is
(1:26:20) just like straight up gaslighting that you're doing right now like we trying to be like oh well if you disagree with me that means you're lying like are you
(1:26:26) [ __ ] serious like with this right now literally like I I just actual point out
(1:26:32) the LIE would you like me to point out the LIE uh so it's not sliding I mean I pointed out multiple times that you
(1:26:38) saying things that weren't in wer inconsistent is that really where you're at that one but you said that like
(1:26:44) literally the reason of going out was just like for or wearing makeup was just to be like sexually attracted I think it's one reason pivoted the it's one
(1:26:51) reason of many reason you said oh my God okay so back to back to the lies that you're
(1:26:57) telling though which are [ __ ] insane you say that it's not even directly analogous to to say that gender can be
(1:27:04) equated with transracialism even though it's the same exact concept you believe that race is socially constructed And
(1:27:11) yet when we apply this as a physical phenomenon to people you go into panic mode and you say no we need to have we
(1:27:18) need to have a shared history wait what do you mean physical phenomenon wait
(1:27:24) you need to say your ter try to bro I'm trying what do you you tell me you tell me when it's okay for me to talk Nina go
(1:27:31) ahead you let me know when it's all right for me to point out your lie I just would like you to answer the what
(1:27:37) you meant by a physical phenomenon a physical phenomenon meaning a biological phenomenon there has to be
(1:27:42) a biological characteristic which ties you into this group if there's not you can't be a part of the group that's what you
(1:27:50) said I feel like you're just using a lot of terms interchange that I don't think are consistent with what you mean but if
(1:27:56) you want to continue can you give me two seconds you give me two seconds because
(1:28:02) um he's too white I don't know um give me two seconds I really need to run the bathroom give me
(1:28:07) one that weak bladder which is part of the phenotypical expression of women
(1:28:13) part of their biology that they can't get away from dude I don't know man I used to
(1:28:18) like like nowadays for the last five years I [ __ ] wake up like five six times throughout the night to piss
(1:28:25) what's that nowadays like for the last five years I've been waking up like five six times throughout the night to take a
(1:28:31) piss well you're probably drinking a lot of water I am drinking a lot of water it's probably because I'm black though
(1:28:36) that's probably uh that's probably it yeah that seems that seems [Laughter]
(1:28:43) fair yeah we we were stuck on the black thing for like 40 minutes I was like Jesus Christ like because I I knew
(1:28:50) exactly what like analogy you're trying to make I picked it up like the first time you said it but yeah she knows she
(1:28:56) look nah understands just that her worldview can't account for it so she
(1:29:01) you end up with all these red herrings trying to chase you down different obstacles it's very common very common
(1:29:07) when you're talking to leftists their worldview makes no [ __ ] sense the feminist worldview makes no sense none
(1:29:12) of these [ __ ] people make any sense
(1:29:17) um y yeah it's just true I don't know what else to say it's like that's a true
(1:29:22) statement so we'll wait for um we'll wait for Nina
(1:29:28) to come
(1:29:34) back I'm so sorry I needed a pie since we began and I should have done it beforehand my
(1:29:39) bad we're gonna call we're gonna call this the had to PE cope okay you can if you want I'm done I
(1:29:48) don't I don't think I don't know where else we could possibly go with this like you've basically affirm my worldview
(1:29:53) Every Which way could be affirmed so I don't know what else to say really what's let me unless you want to say
(1:29:59) something you know I'm going to POS a question to both of you go ahead what is a
(1:30:07) woman um I I think a woman is just anyone that identifies as a woman that's
(1:30:13) an infinite regress you can't actually think that plenty of things you can what is a chair that's an infinite
(1:30:20) regress well a chair has an indication of trying to portray information so what information are you
(1:30:26) trying to peray by saying that anybody who identifies is a couch or chair I think you could you could make kind of
(1:30:33) this broad description that uh any any particular thing that you in the case of
(1:30:39) a chair or any type of social descriptor has its limits but I think that the way
(1:30:44) we know what a chair is is by ruling out everything that's not a chair so the thing is is that this
(1:30:52) occurs with almost everything but what you're when you say a woman is anybody
(1:30:57) who identifies as a woman you're entering into an infinite regress because you're not giving us any
(1:31:03) description uh of what a woman actually is at that point so for instance if I said what's a Lakers fan you would say
(1:31:09) somebody that that's indicating somebody who watches their games and goes out and
(1:31:14) like you know or watches them on TV and knows the team and things like so it has some in information which is being
(1:31:21) pointed to with the description saying what information are you pointing to in
(1:31:26) your description of anybody as a woman who identifies as being a woman okay but if you're if using your
(1:31:33) argument about the the teams right if if the characteristic of somebody identifying as a a Lakers fan is that
(1:31:40) they you know have these certain social behaviors why could that not apply to
(1:31:45) somebody identifying as woman doing those same social behaviors that we um relate to being a woman may it could but
(1:31:52) that's not that's not your definition your definition is anybody who identifies as a woman that you didn't say a woman
(1:32:00) somebody who dresses up like this or does this you just said anybody who identifies as that that's like saying
(1:32:06) what's a Lakers fan what the definition no no no it's like saying what's a Lakers fan and somebody says anybody who
(1:32:12) identifies a Lakers fan right it's tological it makes no sense you're saying literally anybody who says this
(1:32:19) thing but you just described a lot of characteristics of people that are Lakers fat so I didn't just say somebody
(1:32:25) who identifies as so who was a fan of sports uh who somebody how so the the
(1:32:33) information that you're indicating there are people who do X Y and Z that's how you know that they're there's something
(1:32:39) there in other words so like if I say what is a chess player or a chess fan the the like definition the definition
(1:32:46) that I would yeah the definition that I would give is you know somebody who watches chess or somebody who plays chess or somebody who does these same
(1:32:53) thing the Brad concept of sports yeah con what does that mean it's an indication that
(1:33:00) they're playing sports or watching sports or doing something with sports so there would be some type of
(1:33:06) definition that was indicated they're not just identifying as that so if I were to say uh what is a sports fan you
(1:33:12) say anybody identifies as a sports fan gives me no information it's just an empty
(1:33:18) label but what do what do you mean like we're talking about somebody a fan of sports like yes which would
(1:33:25) indicate we still use it it still implies something doesn't not yes it does it indicates other information
(1:33:31) which is why you would not identify sports fan as anybody who identifies a sports fan you would identify it as like
(1:33:37) people who watch sports or play sports or do things with sports you would indicate information it wouldn't be an
(1:33:42) empty label an infinite regress would be you saying anybody who identifies a sports fan as a sports fan because then
(1:33:48) I would say well what's a sports fan and you would say anybody who identifies this one and on and on and on becomes so
(1:33:54) tautological in fact I can mathematically show it to you that it just is referencing itself over and over
(1:34:00) it gives me no information right so you saying sports fan does the exact same thing but again like we're to that
(1:34:06) example like if you're saying who identifies as a woman and then like they dress like a woman they act like a woman
(1:34:12) they um behave like one they they do voice training to sound like a woman um is that not the exact same thing no I
(1:34:19) just explained to you well didn't didn't I just give you a descript of the difference between an empty label
(1:34:26) and a definition there's a difference between a definition and a descriptor
(1:34:32) okay so you having an empty label like for instance you say my name is Nina
(1:34:38) right well I can't give you a definition of Nas because it's an empty label it
(1:34:43) doesn't mean anything it's a self-identified empty label it means nothing it doesn't give me any
(1:34:50) information when I ask you what a woman is and you say a woman is anybody
(1:34:55) identifies a woman what information are you giving me about what a woman is what are you giving me what are you showing
(1:35:03) me what are you telling me there idice as a woman yeah right it's an infinite
(1:35:08) regress it it just it just continuously plays off that's where it becomes the social aspect of what I mean that's
(1:35:15) where the main problem comes between the the sex and gender aspect of it to you it should mean woman or like uh
(1:35:21) biological female right because you said to me to me a woman
(1:35:26) would be an adult human female okay so if a trans woman if woman
(1:35:33) is an adult human female then a transwoman is somebody who is an adult human female no and a trans
(1:35:40) woman is an adult human male with a mental illness okay but but woman to you
(1:35:46) means adult human female right yes right so if a trans the trans aspect being
(1:35:52) that they are um going from a male to female they can't that's a biological
(1:35:57) impossibility but you already no but you already accepted the fact that transwoman is a form of woman it's just
(1:36:05) different right but if we're going to talk about the phrase woman you have to you have to accept the fact that
(1:36:11) transwoman means a a person trying to go into the class of woman to your
(1:36:17) definition which is a biological impossibility fale right so it's it's a
(1:36:23) it's an possibility So when you say doesn't matter but you're relating that matter you still have to accept that
(1:36:29) though that's like literally your logic not only do I not have to accept it but it's wrong what you're saying is
(1:36:35) incorrect a fair phrase to use for what what states a fair a fair phrase to use
(1:36:41) for what phenomenon to describe trans people no to describe men males who are
(1:36:48) attempting to act like females due to mental illness okay so they are okay so
(1:36:54) you are literally agreeing with what I'm saying where you your definition of
(1:37:00) transwoman should still mean exactly as it as you said it was where it's um
(1:37:06) biological males that are um presenting as yes as yeah so there's information so
(1:37:12) there's information with the definition whereas in your definition of woman and infinite regress there's no information
(1:37:17) there's no information in your definition none okay you're not giving me any information definition of that is
(1:37:24) to some extent I don't agree with your mental illness aspect but it's pretty consistent with mine so it seems to me
(1:37:30) that um G to be like no it's not you don't have a definition except to say
(1:37:37) it's the thing you asked me what it is you're saying so if I say what's a rock you say well it's a rock what's the
(1:37:42) definition of a rock any anything that we think is a rock well what is a rock anything we think's a rock but a rock
(1:37:48) the thing what is that anything we think it is you see how [ __ ] stupid that is n I think you're trying to run away from
(1:37:55) the fact that literally you confirmed that trans women are women that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life
(1:38:00) trans women are women so Nina one more time run away from that if you say are
(1:38:06) you running away from that Nina no of course Nina I've already emphatically stated by definition of what a
(1:38:12) transwoman is okay so transwoman or women we love that for you that's they're not
(1:38:17) women the definition that I gave you does imply in no way that it's a woman because a woman's an adult human female
(1:38:23) it's a qualif human would be the opposite of that you said like firew woman was still
(1:38:30) like a you know in your mind a uh adult biological female that just has another
(1:38:37) qualifier relating to it to occupation somebody has another qualifier relating
(1:38:43) to occupation but they're actual female so the qualifier for trans women are as
(1:38:49) you said um as much as I don't agree with the mental illness aspect of it that's fine but it they are biological
(1:38:56) males who want to perceive themselves as women or present themselves as women who
(1:39:02) are acting as women so so what's the distinction they're not women because to
(1:39:08) be a woman the qualia requires female so they can't be women they
(1:39:14) behaving in like how they so who cares if they behave like labradors are they
(1:39:19) Labradors okay so no I answer my question if they behave as Labradors are they
(1:39:25) Labradors if they behave like lab that doesn't yeah are you
(1:39:30) saying furry like furries no I'm not saying FES I said their Labradors are
(1:39:36) they Labradors no they're furry Labradors I would assume no they're not Labradors
(1:39:42) just say no just say no just try not to lie for once in your life and say no they're not Labradors Andrew they're not
(1:39:47) am not lying do you think that they're [ __ ] Labradors because they act like they're Labradors
(1:39:54) you can't ask me to just do yes or no questions you understand the fallacy that is you qualify do I have to ask you that
(1:40:00) when did you stop beating your wife question there were certain question the answer would be no I've never beaten my
(1:40:05) wife there you go no yes or no yes or no just answered no I've never beaten my wife no no no no you can't have the rest
(1:40:12) of that you just have to answer yes or no I already told you yes or no qualif you stop beating your wife do you
(1:40:17) understand why that that question what that question me called loed question but unless you can point out unless you
(1:40:23) can point out what question I'm asking you that's loaded unless you're unless you point out allowing me to do subtlety
(1:40:30) you're not allowing me to do my answers I'm asking you to give me the yes or no unless you can point out what's loaded
(1:40:36) and then give me your qualifier after the yes or no no you were you were asking me literally just yes or no I I
(1:40:41) gave you my qualifier I said you're going to compare that to like the uh like if somebody's like Iden as a or
(1:40:50) might be did you wake up this morning
(1:40:56) what did you wake up this morning yes why was that so hard to do it's almost
(1:41:03) like when there's not a loaded question question didn't involve subtlety my guy loaded it wasn't loaded none of the
(1:41:08) questions I've asked you are loaded you asked me a loaded question you asked me a loaded question so so since I'm not
(1:41:15) asking you trying to give to you that you you're doing those things to me for a second you know if you want to
(1:41:21) make the claim that he's asking you load of question which question you felt yes yes tell me what's loaded about the question well the the labrador question
(1:41:27) repeat it does it make you a labrador to act like a
(1:41:34) labrador doesn't make you a labrador yeah if that's a loaded question tell which is loaded like yeah I think it's I
(1:41:40) would just say no cab but the point is that we're talking about language related to
(1:41:46) um if you're like a a furry who like identifies as a laborator where you're a laborator furry then yeah but that's not
(1:41:54) what I asked you I didn't ask you about furry I asked you if you pretend to be a labrador are you a labrador you prend
(1:42:00) Bex yeah are you a literal dog a literal dog no of course not right right so the
(1:42:06) descriptor here for when we say Labrador when we have a definition of Labor you're talking about Behavior though
(1:42:11) that's where I'm I'm not just talking about behavior I'm saying that my definition of female has a biological
(1:42:17) element to it and so as a descriptor indicates something your definition doesn't indicate anything it's an empty
(1:42:23) right no exactly but like okay to to bring it back to the laborator um question if you behave like Gabor
(1:42:31) nobody's going to necessarily assume that you are a literal dog but to some extent you could have be in the furry
(1:42:38) maybe I'm going to in the weeds with that one but like your behavior could still get
(1:42:44) across something that you're trying to get across right like I don't think everyone should just like identify as like FES or like
(1:42:51) like like that's like the same identification as like somebody who's like doing like their gender identity but I'm just trying to use like the
(1:42:57) language the language is if somebody is behaving in a way they still might want to be identified as such in a particular
(1:43:04) environment it doesn't mean that necessarily like sorry go ahead no I so
(1:43:09) so there's some things here that I agree with but when we're talking about descriptors and definitions if you say to me Andrew what's the definition of a
(1:43:16) woman I say adult human female then any qualia where you attribute woman from
(1:43:22) now on the quality of female has to be included right because it's that's what it means adult human female so if you
(1:43:28) say fir woman it's going to indicate female every single time if you say uh
(1:43:34) you know [ __ ] I don't I don't I don't know what else whatever you put in as woman it's always going to make the indication of female because that's
(1:43:40) definitionally true definitionally true in your case you're saying a a a woman
(1:43:47) there's anybody who identifies as a woman that doesn't give us a single bit of information as to a woman is it's
(1:43:54) just an empty label in fact the trans Community has moved away from that because they know it's an empty
(1:44:02) label right I mean I don't disagree that there is a empty to the label like I
(1:44:08) don't care I didn't disagree with that at any point I'm just saying that if we're going to use the phrase
(1:44:14) transwoman the qualifier within that is where that becomes important where
(1:44:20) you're saying that it's the same right well I'm saying if you make the claim
(1:44:27) transwoman right necessarily you're trying to make the inclusivity of female in woman right but
(1:44:34) the term in this particular case means man who is trying to pretend to be
(1:44:40) female male trying to pretend to be female that would be transwoman my
(1:44:46) definition okay so what's the problem with that like
(1:44:52) you're still saying the word transwoman so like what you don't add like the qualifier there like I don't understand
(1:44:59) like if you're using phrase transwoman like yeah the the woman part maybe just doesn't really apply that severely I
(1:45:06) mean it does if we're talking about like transwoman versus trans man but it's like it's more of like the the first part is the more important important
(1:45:13) part right you trans you mean yeah yeah I think that that would
(1:45:21) be the indication that there's something there that's not woman so it means something different than
(1:45:29) female okay yeah I I think that that you know again like that's actually pretty trans inclusive that I I I have no
(1:45:36) problem with that I think that's basically what most trans people think it's not what most trans people think it's not no they're very different
(1:45:43) positions oh of course yeah there's a lot of like discourse in there it's a new um you know if you'll ConEd yeah if
(1:45:50) you'll concede that's true that we're indicating something that's not a female
(1:45:55) and you're willing to concede that I'm willing to concede it too absolutely I don't think a transom is a biological
(1:46:00) female absolutely can never be can never be right a biological female yeah yeah I
(1:46:07) don't was that
