(0:08) Somebody actually said in the chat earlier that this is like a twisted version of whatever because it's it's
(0:14) all the dudes and then only one girl. So, we're kind of there.
(0:20) There's definitely there's definitely some horrors on here. But, uh I I just don't think I just want to point out like like Jay's
(0:27) friend. Okay. Oh, now that you say that, you have to say who and it better not be me.
(0:33) Well, I mean, I was I was thinking of attention horse and I would say that Andrew takes the cake on that one.
(0:38) What do you mean? You can't, you know, you could say a lot. You love the Listen, you love the sound of your own voice. We all do,
(0:44) though. Look, you can say that, right? And uh it would be true that I do have a silky
(0:50) smooth voice. No one's denying that. The silkiest and smoothest anywhere on TikTok, just ask them. That's what they
(0:55) always lead with. They're like, "You have a voice for radio." And I'm like, "A face for it, too. A face for it, too." But, but the thing that you cannot
(1:04) deny is that I do tweet things I actually believe. I just phrase them in such a way that
(1:10) people lose their [ __ ] minds because it's really funny. And I'm not ever going to stop doing that because, well,
(1:17) it's really [ __ ] funny. And I just like I don't know what to do about that. No, it's one of the compliments I've
(1:22) given you in the past and you know that. I appreciate that. I believe that you believe what you're saying and you stick
(1:28) by it even if I disagree with it. Gay for that point misfit. I thought your
(1:34) your woke right debate with Andrew was pretty fun and I I came out if you remember I came on afterwards and the
(1:39) biggest critique that you got uh once I was on the panel was that you were giving ground to people like me because
(1:44) we would have uh like we would we would be able to you weaponize the your description of the world
(1:49) which by the way I was right about that misfit page they they have been trying to weaponize it against people they should do an app descriptor
(1:57) and I [ __ ] hope they do that's the point it is a real thing and it's a real problem I don't give a [ __ ] who uses it
(2:04) to point out the fact that people like Nick Fuentes, Candace Owens, and a bunch of other [ __ ] retards that are taking over the right should be kicked out. So,
(2:10) yeah, good. Keep using it, please. Yeah, but what about the fact that it's not just being used for them? That was the whole point of the context of the
(2:17) debate to begin with. I think it's And it's being used It's being used way more to be weaponized against people who
(2:23) like, look, this is my was my whole point. The left calls those people [ __ ] Nazis. You're not going to one
(2:30) up them with woke right, dude. Like that's deliluding. That's actually deliluding.
(2:36) Yeah. It's like they literally call them [ __ ] Nazis. And so it's like from my
(2:41) perspective, all you've done is create a weapon which they can use against people you wouldn't consider to be Nazis. They
(2:47) just call them woke rights. So if the So if retards misuse something that is like so if there's if there's a
(2:53) real problem, we shouldn't bring attention to the real problem because some retards might misdirect bringing
(2:58) attention to the real problem at the wrong people. [ __ ] you know, like it's it's that's a personal sounds like a concession that it's a
(3:04) real thing. You just doesn't want you to talk about it. Exactly. It's a real thing. It's a real problem and you you don't not address it
(3:10) because somebody might uh attack the wrong person. You captain is James Lindsay, dude.
(3:16) Yeah. I never thought I would align with James Lindsay. I considered him like an enemy for so long until this woke right
(3:22) stuff. I was like, "All right, James, like we can align real." You and James Lindsay look like you would be aligned right.
(3:29) But let me point Let me point something out here that I think about critical race theory. And let's see if Ryan makes this concession.
(3:35) James Lindsay isn't doing this because he's legitimately upset about anything other than these people attack him and
(3:42) make fun of him for his stupid [ __ ] takes and he wanted to weaponize a term against them. Yeah. Well, I pretty much he's a grip
(3:49) for sure. Like I told you in the debate, I don't even follow Jame. I I follow him like as as like a button push, but I don't watch
(3:55) his content. And I I started talking about this completely separate of James Lindsay. And I think that our definitions are different. So, you know,
(4:02) the the you know, classifying me as the same as James Lindsay or saying that we're doing the same thing or saying the
(4:07) same thing is disingenuous. And also, I don't really [ __ ] care. Like, I don't
(4:12) care about this whole like guilt by association thing that everybody tries to do. I don't have a cult. I don't have a click. I don't
(4:18) Well, it's not a guilt by association, but for sure what happens is sometimes
(4:23) groups will create a term and other people will piggy back off of that term. Yeah. Like America first.
(4:29) Yeah. You Well, wait a second. Uh there's people who I would say piggybacked off the term AF or America
(4:36) first. Sure. Uh I wouldn't say that Donald Trump did though. It's true that other people the use the slogan, but
(4:42) they were completely disconnected in terms for you though. you you attach yourself to the branding of this and
(4:48) definitely use it in the same context that Lindsay does. That's why people associate you with his message of what it is because that's correct.
(4:56) I don't see the difference. What's the difference between you and James Lindsay? So like like we are we are
(5:01) seeing a similar message but I think that he gets uh he gets into it very um you know he gets more indepth into the
(5:07) psychology behind it where whereas I just go with the literal terminology of woke basically just means oppressor
(5:13) oppressed with a victim mentality basically acting just like the left but on the right and and we we talked about
(5:18) this in the debate we don't have to rehash the whole thing what James just quickly so you're saying that like the wolf right they use they use various
(5:25) forms of identity politics there's like a faction of the right wing that uses various forms of identity politics.
(5:30) Sure. Yeah. But it's not just identity politics, right? The main tenant of woke like which we discussed in the debate
(5:36) with Andrew, it's basically the oppressor oppressed where there is a they out there. There is a people group
(5:42) that is holding you down and you have to rad you have to impose radical change throughout the government and have some
(5:48) some type of um overreach and totalitarian control in order to shut down the they right. And on the right,
(5:56) on the right, on the right, the they is like Israel, the Jews, and [ __ ] globalists. On the left, it's
(6:03) capitalists and Trump and [ __ ] It's the same. Yeah, I get it. I get it. So, you're saying that these people, they uh they
(6:09) they have a they somebody outsider. They identify a systemic problem. They think that they are they there's an injustice
(6:15) being being imposed upon them by a systemic problem, and then they have an outside threat. Which which um like
(6:21) right-wing movement or throughout the 20th century wasn't like that.
(6:26) Every political movement inherently believes there's a threat that they need to push back against and they want
(6:31) change. So, well, I you leaving out the word radical, right? That's why I said
(6:36) radical. You see, like the woke right wants like all abortions are are are bad
(6:41) and all abortions. Now, I'm just saying this is just one example, so it doesn't encapsulate the whole movement. But what
(6:47) they would want is they would want the government to force that abortion law on the entire country and and basically
(6:54) throw away the constitution. The left Christian, right? Then the left wants the exact opposite. They
(6:59) want all abortions to be legal. They want abortion up until birth. Now, this is Do you want all anything to be illegal,
(7:04) Miss Do you want all theft to be illegal? Oh, murder. Sure. Okay. So, are you woke right then?
(7:11) No. center. I could I think I could clear this up, right? The difference between Misfit and
(7:17) James Lindsay is James Lindsay is actually woke by his own definition because he believes Israel are the
(7:23) constantly oppressed and misfit sticks up for Israel because he's on the Epstein list. That's the difference
(7:28) between him and James Lindsay. Release the list. Trump. Hey guys, I can't remember. Can someone remind me who was president when Epstein died? I
(7:35) just can't place I was actually enjoying that exchange. Can we just keep going? Can you guys remind me who was president when Epstein
(7:41) died? Trump. Oh yeah, that's right. That's crazy. Who was president when Hitler did stuff
(7:47) like what kind of [ __ ] people? I actually just don't see what the uh because you when you look at the at the
(7:52) woke right, you're looking at some sort of like a modern incarnation like a new sort of beast when it comes to uh like
(7:59) politics, but the fact that they have an outside force that they think is imposing an injustice upon them and they
(8:04) use identity politics, it's like no [ __ ] That's what right-wing movements do. Cool. All right. So again, what we're
(8:10) what what you're trying to do is generalize this this woke terminology to
(8:16) apply to so many other people like Andrew says is the problem. What I do is I very specifically tailor it to one
(8:22) group of well a couple groups of people. The Groper movement, right? These uh they call them dissident right,
(8:28) reactionary right, whatever you want to call them, but they are acting in a fashion that is very similar from
(8:34) anybody with a set of eyes to the woke left. The woke left is basically the far
(8:41) left, right? The woke right is basically the far right. Now the far left
(8:48) are generally considered woke as well. It's not the same, but it's close where there where the the majority of woke
(8:54) left are on the far left. Would that be a fair statement? No. The majority like the average liberal
(8:59) believes in like systemic oppression of of like black people for example and like recognizes like disparities in healthcare and education, all this
(9:04) stuff. I think far left broad definition. That's the problem. It's not It's not a broad definition. Hang on. Hang on. I'll explain it. I'll
(9:11) just just so that there's not so much uh issue there. By the way, I just got a $500 donor over on our side from Jordan.
(9:18) Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Um straight to the tooth fund. Yeah, I told you I'd pay for it, Ryan.
(9:24) You just got to tell me. But anyway, uh just to like clarify this, when you're talking about the far left, we're we're
(9:30) talking about Marxists, uh hard socialists. That's that's far left. When
(9:36) you're talking about woke, woke is just looking at the ideas of like equity and they're looking at the ideas of how to
(9:43) draw attention to the various plightes of minorities. And so a lot of times the absurdities of like all the purple hair
(9:49) and the [ __ ] nose rings and the ear, you know, all that [ __ ] is literally designed to specifically get eyes on
(9:56) them so that they can move after whatever they perceive as those plightes. So when you're talking about far-left, never associated with
(10:02) wokeness. Quokeness is a specific example of left-wingers who utilize um
(10:08) you know uh modern dress and things like this in order to associate attention on them for whatever those issues are.
(10:15) That's what wokeness really is. So you you would agree that there are two descriptors in in the in the term woke left. There is the word woke which
(10:22) is a descriptor and there is the word left which is a descriptor. Yes. Right. Just like where there is a descriptor in
(10:27) the two descriptors in woke right. There is woke and there is right. trying to isolate what woke means, which is all
(10:34) I'm doing, is is very simple. There is a oppressor, oppressed, a they out there,
(10:40) which is where the terminology started. Like we just like we discussed in the debate, it was started by this group of, you know, black people who were like,
(10:46) we're being held down and we need to we we are waking up, right? And look at what the grippers call themselves,
(10:51) noticers. A simile to woke, right? We notice, we are awake, we are noticing, right? So there is
(10:58) the difference being that black people were systemically oppressed. It's like there were laws. They they believe and what do you do in
(11:03) the morning? You wake up. Whoa. Yeah. Yeah. That's See, that's the [ __ ] that's the [ __ ] stuff that
(11:08) James Lindsay says that I don't I don't agree with where I'm like he's making it too intellectual, complicated, and I I'm
(11:13) trying to simplify it. It is a oppressor oppressed victim mentality, hyperfixated on identity politics. Now that's the
(11:20) woke side on the right and left side where you have to differentiate it where the left has equity inclusion and uh the
(11:26) the they is a different people group where the right is you know nationalism
(11:31) socialism isolationism and there is a different people group that's the difference between the two um the two
(11:37) sides of this is yeah but this is just stupid like what you're talking about is just let me just you just you just know
(11:47) wait just let me let me So what you're just talking about is just a basic ideological dialectic
(11:53) that's always like if you look at the 20th century and you look at the communist threat and then if you have more of a nationalist uprising fascist
(11:59) uprising against the communist you wouldn't call the fascist commas
(12:05) you'd call them what they are right or yeah so why you doing so why are you doing that with this why you why you
(12:11) applying the leftist logic like woke is a specific thing woke is a technology that looks at um
(12:16) that looks at race and gender and all these types of thing and then looks at equity and looks at intersectionality.
(12:23) All base all based stuff. Love that stuff. See, you're you're again you're taking the wrong descriptor and applying it to
(12:29) the other word in the descriptor, right? You're taking the left and applying it to woke. Woke just means awake to the
(12:37) idea that there is a that is holding us down. No, it's not like woke is about is
(12:44) about leftwing racial ideology, leftwing gender ideology and intersectionality. Otherwise, they would have never called
(12:49) it woke left. They would have just called it woke. But they they don't call it that.
(12:55) I'm going to kindly remind you that I am not moderating this round. However,
(13:00) however, Andrew dodged again. You guys started in, but then you let him deflect
(13:06) it all back to Misfit Patriot. I overak ass men.
(13:14) Well, that is Andrew's deflect 247, right? How did I How did I def I was just sitting here, bro.
(13:20) Andrew Andrew, how old is it, Andrew? Is it really your birthday? How old are you? I'm 41. No, it's not my birthday.
(13:25) You're only You're only one year, you're one year older than me and you look that much older than me. Dang.
(13:30) I look I feel like I I look younger than you, but Yeah. Actually, your lighting is not helping you, bro.
(13:36) All right, Andrew, turn turn your head like this to the side. I want to see how much Okay. Yeah. No, you're older. You
(13:41) guys have like similar amounts of gray in your beards. No, he has way more. This this just
(13:47) the light. I don't know. The interesting The interesting thing is is that every single political movement
(13:53) always says there is a negative thing out there, there's a threat out there, whether that be too big of government,
(14:00) government overreach, immorality, or whatever it is. And then they push against it. Every political movement
(14:06) ever has others in it problems they identify. But but it's it's it's using
(14:13) okay but the radical that's going to be that's a tough you you think that banning murder infant murder is radical.
(14:18) So that's going to get down to semantics. I think forced pregnancy is radical. I'm saying I'm saying wait you can use
(14:25) common sense to identify what the woke left. My phone's dying. I gotta go. Andrew thank you so much man. Congratulations
(14:32) on 200,000. Can't wait to see you get more. I gotta get back to work. Since Ice raided the Crucible facilities, now
(14:38) the work's been put on me even more. So, see you guys all. Who do you think called them? Who do you think called them, bro? Who do you think
(14:44) called them? All right. See you later, bro. All right. Bye, Rob. Thank you. Rob Rage quits another debate.
(14:51) What's radical to you? Okay. So, like, and we don't have to I'm literally trying to get your
(14:56) definition on what's radical to you, like abortion, Christian ethics. So, so you you can identify woke. Woke
(15:02) doesn't if you see somebody on the left, right, and they they have these they're espousing certain ideas, you you go
(15:09) that's woke, right? It's like it's one of those things where you you just know it when you see it. Okay. So, you know,
(15:15) no, but I'm saying you know it when you see it. It's one of those things. Okay. But it's you.
(15:20) So, the same thing is happening on the right. There is a there is a um a like I
(15:26) would radical might not be the right word. I would say extreme back on radical and
(15:32) no no I would I would I would say extreme would be better radical and extreme both fit but I would say extreme
(15:37) fits better right so the like the groper movement I would say that the groper movement is a group of extremists right
(15:43) where they want to impose extreme change on the right they are a small faction of
(15:48) the rightwing who is getting the loudest most um the loudest voices with the most
(15:53) attention right to impose radical change to the party. I think that that would be
(15:59) a a statement that most people would agree with. Now, the reason why I think they're woke is because the behavior is
(16:06) very similar to what I see on the left with the hyperfixation on identity politics. The pe the people group is
(16:11) oppressing us, the the conspiratorial [ __ ] [ __ ] about how the like there's there's um the [ __ ] the the
(16:18) Jews control the government and [ __ ] like that. It's a it's the same thing. It's just a different um spectrum. not
(16:26) rooted in reality, right? That's a difference, I would say. So, misfit, you're just talking about talk, not descriptors like blue hair,
(16:32) uh, gender swapping, all this other [ __ ] that's happening on the left. You're just talking about behaviors on the right. I'm talking Yes. I mean, yeah. No, blue
(16:40) hair. Everybody could have blue hair. Conservative people, that's what you're talking about. A conservative could have blue hair. They don't usually, though.
(16:47) I would I would ask you to find one because that I've I've always kind of pondered that. There's a there's a girl
(16:53) on the right um that has pink hair there. Uh what's her name? She's um that's not blue though, right?
(16:59) I know it's not blue, but it is. Wow, Miss Vicin. The [ __ ] man.
(17:04) But I'm saying dyed hair is not is not woke. I don't think anybody would would say specifically said blue. They didn't
(17:10) say certain types of dyed hair. Maybe I associate with how in the world can you be the you know, I was I want to roast
(17:16) Andrew. I really do. But misfit, bro, you're catching all the heat because you keep saying such stupid things, man.
(17:22) What did I say? Stop it. Stop talking. Stop talking. Stop talking, [ __ ] What did I say? That's stupid.
(17:28) Say like I don't want to get back into it. I I I've got a list. There's like a Don't open your [ __ ] holster if you're
(17:35) not going to follow up with what the [ __ ] I said. That's stupid. Okay. Woke right was number one. Language like right out of the [ __ ]
(17:42) gate. So you sit there. So you ask me to define something. I defined it. You You
(17:48) dismiss it. You did not define it. You did not define it. You You failed at defining a good abstraction. But you
(17:55) [ __ ] failed. Everybody sitting right in front of you. You got five people sit with. We're not
(18:01) going to count coder because he's not real bright. We're not going to count because she's a moderator, but you got
(18:07) five people who are still saying you have not defined [ __ ] So only one
(18:12) person that's not ideologically predisposed to think that it's a bad term to use is the only one who thinks that he said some reasonable things.
(18:17) That's curious. Yeah. There there are five people on the panel that disagree with me. I have like tens of thousands of followers, right,
(18:23) who do agree all like like the entire panel disagrees with you. Yeah. Because it's a
(18:28) Also, by the way, they're uh do you guys think Hold on. Do you guys do
(18:33) We're all actual right-wing people. Like I think so anyway. Actual that may be that Australian over there.
(18:39) How do you how do you define actual how do you find actual rightwing? What is what is your definition?
(18:45) I'll give you the three pillars. Yes, please. Yeah. So, the three pillars were outlined years ago by one Michael
(18:51) Savage. Um and he said cultures, border, nation. I would actually accept those as
(18:57) being the three pillars in which I would accept for those who are on the right
(19:02) for both social and economic reasons that we're looking at those three things. We're looking at culture. Mhm.
(19:09) We're looking at language and we're looking at borders. I agree with those things. Yeah. So those those are the the uh kind
(19:16) of three big ones. However, uh when you're talking about culture, so the
(19:22) gaper ideal here is that if culture is being unduly influenced by uh one group
(19:28) or another group that that should be looked at. You say in response, okay, well fair enough. But that's exactly
(19:34) what the left does. The left is saying that whites have undue uh cultural influence where they shouldn't have
(19:39) undue cultural influence. It's like, okay, I can accept that, too. I guess my
(19:44) big disparity with you has always been when I'm kind of defining words and I'm trying to figure out uh dichotomy. In
(19:52) this case, dichotomy is left versus right. So, in order to dive into what
(19:57) the worldview means, why is why is it that they believe these things? Ryan can
(20:03) have racial motivations in the way that he views the kind of overview of how
(20:08) society works and so can the right. They can have racial motivations to look at
(20:13) the way that society works. The issue here is why. What is the pillars which
(20:20) hold up each of these worldviews? That's where I think that you're and I've said this before that your definition here
(20:27) fails to map on. It sounds good only on the surface level. The problem is is that when we get to the actual pillars,
(20:34) the left and right, I agree with you, are not disagreeing that there can be oppressor oppressed classes. That's not
(20:40) it. We're disagreeing on the reasons why, right? The reasoning why there's oppressor oppressed classes. If you look
(20:47) at the left-wing paradigm, it's based around lack of equity and access and social access to basic services, which
(20:56) would uh basically push that equity forward. So that now there was some sort of egalitarianism across the board. That
(21:02) would be what was missing from. So that's their racial prism. The what
(21:08) you're associating here with the dissident right is being their prism is like sure they can look through the same
(21:13) same prism and say there's an oppressor oppressed class and there can even be one race oppressing another. In this case maybe we're oppressed by you know
(21:19) whoever the [ __ ] they say it is. But the pillars but just be toss cool
(21:24) here please. But anyway, um it's not that I'm trying to duck the heart of it.
(21:29) I'm just telling you when I'm on YouTube, so just be cool there. I don't even know what that means, okay? It just means uh don't even say
(21:35) the J word because you get you you'll get mass flagged for things you're not even saying. I didn't. Okay, that's all I'm saying.
(21:41) So anyway, the the prism though, what are the core things which hold that ideology up has nothing to do with
(21:47) equity and it has nothing to do with the disparagy. It has to do with conquer, might, uh subtrifuge, things like this.
(21:55) So I I think that your your kind of like core here for for how you map these on
(22:00) doesn't actually make and I never thought it made sense. The second we take it from the uh the slight overview
(22:06) into the depths of what holds it up. I've never thought they mapped on very well. I think I think let me explain something
(22:12) that I didn't explain the last bit. I think that what you're looking at is like the two words, right? And there's a behavior and a solution, right? So
(22:19) there's the behavior side of woke, which is what I'm classifying as woke. Then there's the solution problem which is
(22:25) what you're talking about. On the left it's equity inclusion and they have they have this idea of radical change but
(22:30) with but that's the worldview for the descriptor. No no no yeah sure but no because with
(22:35) the but with the right hold up with the right wing you have a lot of people
(22:41) espousing nationalism or or isolationism, right? With the left you have a lot of people espousing
(22:47) socialism, right? Or communism. And those aren't mutually exclusive. leftwingers leftwingers have often been
(22:55) the ones who actually advocate for for isolationism. Bernie Sanders and most of
(23:00) the Democrats in their early career when talking about immigration especially were very much if they were socialist
(23:06) isolationists because they understood the uh economic impact that immigration would have on local job displacement. So
(23:13) they actually I can show you especially in the uh '7s and ' 80s where hardcore
(23:18) socialist activists inside the United States were literally whipping up mobs to beat up immigrants coming in so that
(23:25) they could stop them from coming in and they they made a big deal out of it. So it's like I don't know about that. I would I would
(23:32) I would argue that woke is a new term for a new movement. And I would argue that the the reason why the woke um term
(23:40) was created, like you said, was because it was it was a lot different in the in the modern um context than what previous
(23:49) uh revolutions and previous um uh movements were like back then because
(23:54) there was a different um atmosphere. Now, like I said, what I did and what
(24:00) James Lindsay did are two different things. They're similar, but they're two different things, right? All I'm doing is trying to put a descriptor to a group
(24:06) of people because I believe that that group of people I agree with that. Like I agree with what you're saying there that
(24:13) what he's trying to do is is intellectually categorize like he gets
(24:18) way too complicated with it. And and that's fine. That's all well and good. That's fine, right? But what I'm simply
(24:23) trying to do is exactly what we did to the left. We turned the woke left into a
(24:31) descriptor for a certain group of people. And if you want to try to pick it apart and define it, it's much for
(24:38) the for the general population. You just know it when you see it. And this is what I'm saying. There are a lot of
(24:44) people out there. Now, there might be people on the panel that don't agree with me, but there are a lot of people that agree with me that you know it when
(24:50) you see it and when they hear woke right, they go, "Ah, I've been thinking that." So, if you guys don't agree with
(24:56) it, if you want to try to pick it apart, that's fine. There are so many people that think you're Can I show you? Can I just like show you
(25:02) real quick an inductive example of what I'm talking about? So, Sure. Do you agree with me that a Nazi and a
(25:08) socialist are two totally different things? Totally different. Yes. No, but different. Yes.
(25:15) Okay. It's the National Socialist German Workers Party. So, they kind of went socialism just for like the Arian racist.
(25:20) So, I So, I just want to make sure then um North Korea is actually a republic then. No, that's what I'm saying. Like Nazis
(25:26) were socialists but socialists aren't Nazis if that's okay. So, so then so then when we're talking about modern day and this is
(25:33) what I'm referencing in modern day references when somebody says Nazi and
(25:38) somebody says socialist. Yeah. What? Okay. So, so what are the things which bring these ideologies together?
(25:46) Um, the descriptives. Yeah. Yeah. Total I mean the Nazis were
(25:51) totalitarian. The socialists are always leading to totalitarians. So socialism is sort of a precursor for
(25:57) Nazi Nazis, not Nazism itself. Okay. But in the modern sense, what would bring these two ideologies
(26:03) together? I'm not not following. I I don't anything like if you're a modern Marxist
(26:09) or you're a modern Nazi, is there anything which you would have in common? No, the Jew there's a lot of the Jay
(26:15) stuff the there is that there is that commonality that they um that they have a common enemy.
(26:22) They would both have similar desript descriptors about the enemy. Yeah, they both have similar descriptors
(26:28) about the enemy. Exactly. Okay, gotcha. The Jilling. So is it more Hang on. So hang on, hang on. Shut up, Ryan. So is it is it is it
(26:36) actually more useful then because there's this this massive commonality between the two to call all Nazis
(26:42) socialists or Marxists and call all Marxist Nazis
(26:47) is actually useful to do that or does that overlap ideologies where they kind of don't belong?
(26:54) Um, I'm not I'm not really following along with your Andrew, you have failed. If you called if you called a Marxist,
(27:00) communist a Nazi and or you called somebody in the in the modern sense who was a Nazi a Marxist or a communist,
(27:08) would that be accurate language or would you be describing two different phenomenons? If you called a Nazi a Marxist or a
(27:15) socialist or communist, then there would be enough um commonalities where it would fit. It just wouldn't be the prop.
(27:21) It wouldn't be the best term to use, but it would it would fit. Why? Why wouldn't it be the best? Well, because they because they had the
(27:26) national they had the more the more national nationalism um aspect to their
(27:31) they have different pillars, right? Yes. Correct. No. So, listen. If it is the case that you have two ideologies,
(27:37) political ideologies that have separate pillars, if if it is the case that you have one big thing, which is an
(27:44) overlapping principle, in this case, let's say shared hatred of Jewish people, uh you still would disassociate both of
(27:50) these identity groups, these political identity groups based on the distinct
(27:55) differences rather than on this one commonality by your own admission because it's much more accurate to get
(28:01) at the pillars of the ideology. And that's the whole point with the woke right versus woke left that I keep
(28:07) trying to kind of get across to you is like if it even if it is the case that I grant to you and do that there could be
(28:14) both sections who utilize race for the purposes of uh dissecting it and understanding how it impacts uh you know
(28:20) society and uh you know the social forms and things like this. But if the pillars which are underneath them don't hold up
(28:28) right for you can't actually apply the same idea. It doesn't make any sense. The pillars aren't the same. Okay. So,
(28:34) like, and this is what I'm saying. I think that I I see I see your argument. I just think it's it's sort of
(28:39) redundant, right? It's like, all right, so you got the Zohan Ramdani uh in um the New York mayor primaries race,
(28:46) right? He Yeah. based. Yeah. He is what I would call an Islam Marxist, right?
(28:51) But you wouldn't call him a Nazi, would you? No, no, no. But he is what I would call an Islam Marxist, right? And he calls
(28:56) and he calls himself a democratic socialist. Right. Now, these like if you
(29:02) ask two different people, right, we're we're both going to say, "Yeah, you're right. He is an Islam Marxist." And you
(29:07) ask somebody on the left, they go, "No, he is a democratic socialist." But the ideas behind totalitarianism and
(29:13) authoritarianism, they're all basically branching down into these different subcategories, which is what you're
(29:18) trying to get to. So, it's it's just like Christianity, right? You you have Christianity, you have Christianity, Christianity, which is the
(29:25) And you're a poor student. So, so Christianity is the overarching thing and then you have you have Protestants
(29:31) roast Andrew and Andrew you failed as a teacher. Sure. Misfit still doesn't understand
(29:37) anything. I just I I understand that you don't understand what Look, I understand you're you're not a
(29:44) I understand you're [ __ ] It's like a disappointed uncle seeing his nephew just be an idiot at the table
(29:50) and just scold my father. I love watching you all fight. I think it's great. I get I get it. The the dude
(29:56) the dude with the glass infighting in fighting is healthy. Yeah, it can be. Yeah, the dude with the glass is [ __ ] and
(30:01) interrupts people when they're in the middle of their sentence. That's great. All right. So, but like I was saying, Christian barely said anything going on
(30:07) and you are the [ __ ] that's sitting there. I can't help it if I overpower the conversation because everybody you literally can't understand the
(30:13) simple principles that Andrew is laying out. Andrew, please do a better job as a teacher. I agreed with him. I agreed with him. I
(30:20) believe in you, Andrew. See, this is the problem. know why my position is so
(30:26) lucrative? Because people talk over each other. You can't even have one [ __ ]
(30:33) conversation that's meant to be casual and chill and here you are still being numb skull.
(30:39) Sarah, you shouldn't have invited you shouldn't have invited me because this I'm like a magnet for these people. I invited you
(30:45) because I knew I mean number one I liked your interactions with Andrew and I thought it was very
(30:50) I like Yeah, I think it was good. It was good and Ryan as well. You guys all have
(30:56) like the uh Ryan likes me too. Don't listen to his [ __ ] He genuinely likes me as a person.
(31:02) I have I have some positive but I think I mean I think your worldview is ultimately very destructive to the society I want to live in. So I I think
(31:07) it would be very bad if like power but like personally I don't have a
(31:13) problem with you. Uh, you playing right now with glasses on. You said the dude with glasses.
(31:18) There's two. Oh, there's Jake and Chase. What? I mean, I knew who you were talking. This is a tattoo. I don't wear glasses.
(31:25) This is a tattoo. I said it right. I I said it right after you.
(31:30) What is I said it right after. What do you mean by they earlier? You said they. What was the What was the last grade
(31:36) that you passed? Sixth, seventh. What is Are you Oh, so are we doing like
(31:42) Are you Are you like Are you like a Are you like a liberal where you're like I have a college degree, so I'm sorry. Let's get back to the conversation.
(31:48) Yeah. What? What? There we go. So, so just give me a second here. Um, let
(31:55) me I the idea that you're trying to create a definition of woke right around
(32:01) about uh, you know, that Candace Owens is like the woke right, which I don't ne necessarily disagree that she's a poor
(32:07) example of uh, the current right. Uh, but I don't think she's that woke. Uh, which is has a very specific definition.
(32:15) Why is it that you have such an issue with uh, with simple concepts? Are you okay? What do you No, first of all, I
(32:22) have I have like music going on, so I don't know where that's [ __ ] coming from. Um
(32:28) I don't have music. No, it's definitely coming from my headphones. Anyway, um as far as Candace
(32:34) Owens goes, Candace Owens was a far-left who started her her social media career
(32:40) um that way. Now she seems to be defaulting back to to her you you get people like
(32:45) Wait, she was a a far-left? Yeah, she was a far left. I wouldn't say far leftist. I mean, I think that she Well, she was a she was a liberal that
(32:51) started her um I I guess social media YouTube. You know, words have meanings, right? You know, words Yeah, words have Yeah, words do have
(32:58) meanings. Like, when I call you [ __ ] like when I call you [ __ ] I I mean
(33:03) I mean you're just saying dumb things, right? I don't mean that you have Down syndrome. You said far leftist and I said, "Well,
(33:09) wait. I don't think she was ever far left." I'm pretty sure I think she was a far-left. I'm pretty sure. I don't think she was.
(33:14) Okay. Well, you know what? Somebody can Google it, but um I'm pretty sure she was on the far left and that's how she
(33:19) started her career. Then she saw she was an opportunist who saw a movement happening where she sort of switched sides and came over to the right and
(33:26) then she got in with Charlie Kirk and TPUSA and she started saying all of the right things that the that the incrowd
(33:32) wanted to hear right is Charlie Kirk right? No, Charlie Kirk's not walk right. Look, like I understand that this is what you
(33:37) guys want to do. You want to try to discredit the thing that I'm doing by just continuously I don't even know what the [ __ ] you're
(33:43) doing. I just I No, no, no. Listen, it does. It's so stupid for you to try and like push a term that doesn't exist.
(33:50) It does not shock does, right, is they identify something and create a new term. It does not shock me even a little bit
(33:57) that you don't understand something. All right? I can tell just by looking at you that that's that's something that you struggle with every [ __ ] day. But if
(34:03) you want, I can break it down again. All right. You tried and you failed miserably. You Oh, yeah. If you're if you're [ __ ]
(34:09) [ __ ] if I tried to explain [ __ ] quantum physics to a 5-year-old, they wouldn't [ __ ] get it either. Absolutely. I meet a lot of dumb people,
(34:16) but you, sir, absolutely I can imagine taking the cake. All right. So, what what would you like
(34:22) what would normally normally I reserve what would you like me to explain to
(34:27) you, sir? How what you still haven't been able to explain woke, right? other than it's a woke
(34:32) means something and we're going to apply it to the right but woke is specifically
(34:38) designated in my mind towards the left liberal ideology right that's why that's
(34:44) why you're [ __ ] so hold on hold on I want to I want to be clear where is it
(34:51) that the left it where where are right people on the left how does that work it doesn't work
(34:57) you okay so again right let me I'm gonna try to break this down to you like I would like a child. Okay.
(35:04) Yeah, please do because you can't explain concepts. You have woke. What does woke mean
(35:10) to me? No, no, no. What does the word woke mean? The word that like if you looked it up
(35:16) has very specific um connotations depending on how it's being used. Which
(35:21) way would you like the way it's being used? No, no, no. I just mean the actual [ __ ] word, right? It means woke means
(35:26) what way is it? Woke means to awaken. Again, you have trouble with simple
(35:33) woke means. If I say something is red, there's like 3,000 variations of red. So, if I say
(35:39) torch red, then I understand that etmology. I'm talking about etmology, right? What does the word mean? Woke
(35:45) means to study to to realize, right? Awaken. Hold on.
(35:51) awaken, realize, notice, like all of these things apply to the word woke. The
(35:57) word there are various other definition. So there's there's a reason why the word
(36:02) was created for this movement. Correct? It's because there was a people group. Andrew, don't you fall asleep.
(36:08) There was a people group who used the word to say this is what we're doing. Right? You have the word associate was
(36:16) applied to a liberal to the leftist movement. They didn't claim to be woke. Oh, I'm
(36:22) woke. Yes, they did. People, we just want to have a nice Thanksgiving
(36:28) dinner as a family for once and you guys can't argue with each other. Get back to the table. Chase,
(36:33) you don't even make it to my soccer games anymore. I don't. I want to know. Andrew, did you lie to
(36:40) me? They said Andrew lied when he said, "We like your opening intro. We hate it." And he forces us to listen to it
(36:46) because he knows we hate it. We like the night intro. Uh, I would never do that, Sarah.
(36:53) Okay. Well, we'll move on from this because I'm I'm overpowering the whole thing. Well, let's talk about Andrew's uh
(36:58) Andrew being a Canadian fighting so hard for American rights. Are you [ __ ] Canadian? No way.
(37:04) That's the rumor. That's worse. Oh, he's Californian. Even worse.
(37:09) True. That is worse than being Well, wait. Is that worse than being a Canadian? I'm not sure.
(37:16) Andrew's pot farm. Andrew's pot farm just got raided. Give him a break. That's true. That's true.
(37:22) And all your employees were underageed Mexican illegals. Also true. I just told you. That's why I
(37:27) called ICE. You know, raided my own farm. Own farm. You got you got Ray Rayless over there.
(37:34) He was he was uh the one that was, you know, trying to I think Canadians definitely worse than California for sure. Think
(37:41) I don't know, man. I don't know. I think honestly I think that most of Canada is actually reasonable. It's like they have
(37:47) they have these three small three or four small Now we got to find this rat. We got to find a rat in the [ __ ] chat. Who Who
(37:52) spilled the beans? Sarah. Uh this
(37:58) you know what? I'm gonna make my videos even louder. And see this is what this is called counter
(38:03) ratting. You little [ __ ] It's counterratting any paid $5. Yeah, now we know. Collins, time Collins

(38:16) dude. Uh, we got about five more minutes left and I'm going to give Andrew a very short break. It was supposed to be
(38:22) longer, but uh yeah. But anyways, um I would like It's turned into a debate part two for
(38:29) I know you guys just can't resist it. I didn't start it. I bro that's [ __ ]
