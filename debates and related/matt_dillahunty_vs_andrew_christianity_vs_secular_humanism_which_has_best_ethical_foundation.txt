(1:36) all right thanks so much folks for being with us we're going to get into our main event debate for the night before we do
(1:42) we're going to do something different in particular this conference has a sponsor which is manifold who we really do
(1:48) appreciate manifold is the online play prediction market so you don't use any
(1:54) real money you don't have to risk any of your real money it's just for fun like Monopoly money you can predict anything
(1:59) in including the debates we have for debate conon this weekend so what we're going to do is in order to resolve who
(2:06) is more persuasive during the debate is we're actually going to do a before and after poll raising your hands you don't
(2:15) have to vote but if you happen to lean one way or the other namely if you think
(2:20) that Christianity has a better foundation for ethics even just a smidge or if it's all
(2:28) the way then at that point you'd put your hand up if you're like totally 5050
(2:33) or like I I really am truly 50 then don't put your hand up when we do the poll and then if you lean towards
(2:39) secular humanism even a smidge or 100% you'd want to put your hand up when we give that option does that make sense so
(2:46) we're going to do a percentage basis so percent at the start of the debate and then at the end and then for our online
(2:53) audience you highly encourage you to check out manifold which is linked in the description box you can actually
(2:58) vote right now now in terms of who you think will win in other words be more persuasive in this debate by clicking on
(3:06) that link right now in the description box thanks so much to manifold for sponsoring our
(3:11) event and by the way last if you want to vote in person via manifold you can
(3:18) actually use your phone camera and use the QR code and actually do that right here if you want to do that vote as well
(3:24) so with that want to say we're gonna have Matt going first but before we do we're going to do that quick hand vote
(3:31) if you happen to lean even like a smidge or all the way towards secular humanism
(3:37) would you slip your hand up and then we're gonna give Chris a chance to he's gonna Vote or count them
(3:43) real
(3:49) quick cool and then if you happen to lean a smidge or all the way all the
(3:54) degrees in between or Christianity if you slip your hand up
(4:03) you got it all right great so Chris has that recorded and then we'll resolve the market at the end of the debate but with
(4:08) that we're going to kick it over to Matt for his opening statement thanks so much for being with us and Matt the floor is all yours for your
(4:15) opening thanks so much James and thanks Andrew for being here and all of you for showing up um humanism has as its focus
(4:24) the betterment of humanity in this life while Christianity has as its focus adherence to a God and the dispos
(4:29) position of souls in an afterlife our best efforts in this life are according
(4:34) to the Bible like filthy rag our best attempts at righteousness and Justice are portrayed as vile and disgusting
(4:40) when compared to a bumbling god constantly failing to get his creation to love and respect him while also
(4:46) prescribing the death penalty for nearly everything adultery blasphemy breaking the Sabbath disobedient children
(4:52) witchcraft worshiping another God not being a virgin on your wedding night which is better for society well I'd say
(4:59) the one that has human society as its focus and isn't so intent on killing humans for not buying into a specific
(5:05) Doctrine heaven and hell if they were to exist aren't human societies what a God thinks is unknown and
(5:13) irrelevant there's never been a secular humanist Nation either in a governmental form which I'm not advocating for or in
(5:20) a primary philosophical view of the majority of the population which means we have to look at the ideals between
(5:25) these two positions secular humanism has been around for 90 years 19 1933 the first secular humanist Manifesto was
(5:31) published it identified humanism as a religion with 15 points it was updated 40 years later in 1973 with a lot more
(5:38) information and then it was incredibly shortened in 2003 in addition to the
(5:43) manifestos there are organizations like the council for secular humanism American humanists Etc in the first
(5:50) version of the Manifesto It's presented as a religious view where it acknowledges there's no Supernatural guarantee of human value we Advocate a
(5:58) heightened sense of person personal life and a Cooperative effort to promote social well-being the goal of humanism
(6:04) is a free and Universal society in which people voluntarily and intelligently cooperate for the common good in the
(6:11) manifesto version 2 40 years later this includes a lot more information short
(6:17) versions they they begin by saying those who sign this disclaim that they are setting forth a binding Credo this
(6:24) statement reaches for a vision in time that needs Direction we affirm a set of
(6:30) common principles that can serve as a basis for United action this isn't a to-do list or Thou shalt or Thou shalt
(6:36) not list we're fine with religion's inspiration but we're opposed to dogma and authoritarian views that place
(6:42) anything above human needs religions don't pass the test of scientific evidence the promises of immortal
(6:48) salvation or Eternal damnation are ucer and harmful ethics and moral values stem from Human Experience and situational
(6:54) ethics stem from the human need and human interest reason and intelligence are the most effective instruments we
(7:01) possess we are not advocating for the use of scientific intelligence independent of or in opposition to
(7:08) emotion for we believe in the cultivation of feeling and love individuals are precious and their
(7:15) dignity is affirmed this is important us human being
(7:23) affirming the value of individuals and human beings is more powerful than a god
(7:29) affirming it and it's infinitely more powerful than a human claiming a god
(7:34) affirms this which is all we appear to have the third version of the manifesto in a nutshell it's so short whether God
(7:42) exists or not we have problems to solve we have to do this without appeals to the supernatural entities or intervention we must utilize the best
(7:48) methods at our disposal reason and science seem to be the primary ones to assess reality and reach conclusion
(7:55) Justice fairness equality and autonomy are the primary goals this life not a
(8:00) hypothetical afterlife is what we're trying to improve so what happens when religions control societies and
(8:05) governments either legitimate or illegitimate well conflicts with other societies and other governments may not
(8:11) have any reason to diplomatic solution need only look to Gaza but that's Islam
(8:17) and Judaism here we have Christianity as a primary and Christian nationalism
(8:23) under secular humanism you get to be a Christian a Jew a Muslim gay straight
(8:28) socialist capitalist you just don't get to impose those necessarily on others through acts of
(8:34) Fiat not necessarily true with the religions in charge of the
(8:39) government Mike Johnson's the new speaker of the house in the United States he's homophobic because all get out he's argued to criminalize
(8:46) homosexuality homosexualities by the way are US citizens with PF specific rights that he wants to take away moreover he
(8:52) advocates for gay conversion therapy which is unscientific and torturous because he thinks he can help them pray
(9:00) the gay away and the gay can be eliminated he's not anti-gay he just wants them to cease to exist as gay they
(9:07) get to keep being human beings he thinks there's no right to sodomy privacy laws
(9:12) don't protect everything and he thinks that what sort of sex you have it should be his to regulate sodomy by the way is
(9:19) anal or oral copulation which I have it on good authority heterosexual folks
(9:24) engage in as well 2022 he presented a what was called the don't say gay Bill outlawing any
(9:31) discussion of gender identity sexual orientation or related subjects which was incredibly problematic because he
(9:37) ignored the the what the experts have to say about age appropriate content and how critical it is especially for kids
(9:44) under 10 which was his Target to have correct language in order to better report on and about sexual abuse his
(9:52) policy if it had been implemented would have made it more traumatic for kids and more difficult for them to uh out their
(10:00) abusers and easier for abusers to get away with it happily it failed in 2015
(10:05) he blamed abortions and the breakup of the nuclear family for school shootings he also says the teaching of evolution
(10:11) is to blame for mass shootings because we've taught a whole generation of couple Generations now of Americans that
(10:16) there's no right or wrong that it's about survival of the fittest and if you evolve from a primordial slime what is
(10:22) that life of any sacred value he wants student-led prayer back in school so
(10:28) speaker are you okay with Islamic prayers satanic prayers or just particular Christian prayers he's
(10:35) opposed to the separation of religion in government sometimes called the separation in church and state he thinks that the founders only wanted to protect
(10:41) the church from the state and didn't want to protect the state from the church citing the notorious lying pseudo
(10:47) historian David Barton um to support this view he definitely seeks to impose
(10:53) his views on others now some of you are saying hang on he's the speaker of the house he's not the speaker of chrisan
(10:59) Christianity or that's not my type of Christianity great but what is your type
(11:06) what's your type of Christianity like because there's a lot of them how is it better and how can we make sure that we
(11:11) get your better version than the one that Mike Johnson want he thinks his version is correct so do you countless
(11:17) denominations without consensus he's already got more power than my opponent has right now so I don't know Andrew at
(11:24) all I don't know what what version of Christianity is advocating for I didn't bother to look him up we literally just met said hello as I sat down here is his
(11:31) version of Christianity better I really hope so because it' be hard to get a whole lot
(11:37) worse but they point to the same book they point to the same savior the same history liberal and moderate Christians
(11:44) provide legitimacy and cover to hide the fundamentalists and to allow them to engage in Christian
(11:50) nationalism secular humanism allows you to be a Christian right up until you try
(11:56) to oppose it on others and then you get to keep being a Christian you just don't get to practice it in the way where you're imposing it on others you can
(12:01) pray you go to church you can tithe you can worship gather share discuss convert
(12:07) vote based on your values you can vote against your own best interest I see people doing all the time you can teach
(12:13) your kids your values under secular humanism the foundational principles of secular humanism solve conflicts with
(12:19) data debate and discussion instead of coercion conversion or Conquest there is
(12:26) no secular humanist sect and no denomination of humanist that's ever required someone to believe something
(12:31) that is not empirically verifiable that's ever ordered the death of another person that's ever ordered or acted to
(12:38) act or destroy property of any person or government that has ever overthrown a democracy to impose a secular humanist
(12:44) regime that's ever been connected with terrorist cells and activities that's ever denied freedom of speech or
(12:50) expression that's ever called for the deaths of people for criticizing secular humanism or any religious view that is
(12:57) ever advocated for or inspired suicide bombers or terrorist attacks those
(13:02) things are simply not consistent in any way with the core values of secular
(13:07) humanism there is no threat to Christians Jews Muslims
(13:13) scientologists from secular humanists there might be from scientific
(13:18) skepticism and rationality if you're not able to actually demonstrate the truth of your claim but life freedom and an
(13:26) equitable relationship are the foundation of secular humanism there is no list of Thou shalt not or Thou shalt
(13:33) because we recognize that nearly every attempt at such a list fails at some point as we learn more about our world
(13:40) and about getting better at understanding the world better about doing better and being better in this
(13:46) life the goal of humanism is a free and Universal society in which people
(13:53) voluntarily and intelligently cooperate for the common good if you have an OB
(13:58) objection to that or a better goal what is
(14:04) it all right thank you so much for your introductory statement uh we're gonna hand it over to Andrew Wilson for 10
(14:09) minutes so thank you for being here Andrew and the floor is yours you're welcome for those of you who don't know me my name is Andrew Wilson I am the
(14:16) host of The One and Only Crucible the fastest growing debate channel on the
(14:21) internet James I just just in case you didn't know appreciate that very much
(14:27) appreciate everybody being here all of you are way too stodgy in this room very low energy just wanted to let all of you
(14:34) know that ladies and gentlemen of all pronouns the Z's the Z the HM and hers I
(14:40) would like to thank you for tuning in today for this in exciting inperson conference on modern day debate my name
(14:47) is Andrew Wilson um there's a few ways this debate could go the topic is Christian ethics
(14:54) versus secular humanism which which has a better Foundation the funny thing is is I already won that topic because as
(15:00) mattt explained to Jay Dyer he has no justification under the skeptical belief structure to give an accounting for any
(15:06) metaethical uh presupposition he may have he just kind of Grants himself stuff he grants himself logic he grants
(15:13) himself reason he grants himself an entire worldview even though he's using an unjustified starting position for it
(15:19) so I'm not honestly all that interested in doing the God not real do debate because one it's boring and two it's
(15:26) also really boring it goes like to this I don't see enough evidence and remain
(15:31) unconvinced there's a God then I say but you use a theistic worldview of justification like there is a God to
(15:37) Grant yourself logic and everything else so instead of that I'm just going to Grant Matt's entire
(15:43) worldview 2third or more of the plan of this entire planet are all operating
(15:49) inside of a shared delusion that they were created by a sky daddy who loves him some slavery and
(15:55) murderousness he thinks it's funny to kind of Cosmic Le with people that's his
(16:00) deal kind of his whole thing that's Matt's worldview so now Matt's right and
(16:06) the question becomes should we let them to continue to believe in this nonsensical Stone Age Madness or do we
(16:11) stop them from engaging in it my contention is even if God isn't real at all that people acting as though he is
(16:18) is still Superior to whatever nonsensical egalitarian worldview Mack and come up with see Matt also just asks
(16:25) as though the things he believes are true he believes he believes he believes
(16:30) and therefore acts as though logic is real math is real everything is real based on his presuppositional belief
(16:36) that they are real you see human flourishing the Cornerstone of Matt's ideology and that of secular humanism is
(16:43) totally meaningless flourishing by who metric from my perspective for instance
(16:49) attempting to lie to people who claim men can be women isn't human flourishing from Matt's perspective it
(16:56) is why why should the collective of humanity lie and say men can get
(17:01) pregnant why should uh they say that men can have periods things which are
(17:06) categorically and obviously false that preserving homosexuality in
(17:11) society is good for human flourishing even though they are reproductive dead
(17:17) ends and that Western society and egalitarianism is superior to those evil Theo Society even though the Western
(17:23) Nations can't even reproduce their own populations but instead have to replace
(17:28) their population with foreigners from those theist Nations that can reproduce let's start with a basic
(17:35) societal question recently asked of the West who has now embraced a scientific and non-theistic approach to governing
(17:42) super basic question every kindergartener knows if you don't believe me go watch Kindergarten Cop the
(17:48) question posed to the Western nation is can a man be a woman right to the question of if a man can be a woman they
(17:56) say the answer is yes and the way we will decree they can be a woman is by
(18:01) simply saying that woman now means male problem solved thank you Secor humanist
(18:07) thank you so much nope not kidding why you ask would people be this overthe
(18:13) toop stupid well it's simple the good is the good man we have to do what's good
(18:18) for human society and human flourishing and if you don't call these strange lunatics something they obviously aren't
(18:24) they might self-terminate so in order to avoid that we need to make everybody on planet Earth to them this is human
(18:31) flurry just redefine pretend it's true how laughably absurd this worldview
(18:37) is Matt will often say I remain unconvinced well Matt I'm also going to use your standard I need for you to 100%
(18:44) convince me beyond a shadow of a doubt that males can have babies what's the answer going to be no Andrew you big
(18:50) stupid males can't have babies men can have babies cuz we just Define man to
(18:55) include females dummy well Matt I remain unconvinced I'd like Matt to convince me
(19:01) that if you are a male and you are having sex with another male which would not be allowed in my version of a
(19:07) secular humanist worldview how is it that you're not just basically having sex with a guy with a wig on I really
(19:13) want to know the answer to that question not just me but all rational people who aren't lunatics also want to know why
(19:20) it's ma'am isn't a complete and total Croc of garbage because I remain unconvinced that it isn't a total lie
(19:27) and that's these people just pervert the language to include their own perversions and then add human
(19:33) flourishing at the end Matt has said he wouldn't make a law stopping 9-year-olds
(19:38) from having sex with each other not kidding now I know this is going to sound a little bit totalitarian but I
(19:44) would in fact create laws that made it a crime for a 99-year-old and have sex their 9-year-old I would hold the
(19:49) parents criminally liable for allowing this to happen in my evil authoritarian Society where I don't even let
(19:56) 9-year-olds have sex or the parents go straight to jail for negligence now I
(20:01) think that's better for human flourishing I think maybe parents would be far less likely to let their
(20:07) nine-year-olds do that if they went to jail stupid me next I would in my
(20:12) authoritarian Society decree that all simulated sex acts in public were criminal offenses and would make sure
(20:18) that all people went to prison for the crime of indecency which doesn't assist
(20:23) with human flourishing and I'd like to know why I'm wrong secular humanis can basically be whatever the hell you
(20:30) want it to be it doesn't really need the principle of Freedom or the starting axium of freedom and peace in order to
(20:36) postulate whatever it wants it's sloganeering they're slogans they don't mean
(20:41) anything okay why do nine-year-olds need to be able to have sex in order to advance Humanity why do we need to lie
(20:48) about a person's sex in order to advance Humanity why are these things necessary for human flourishing why are decency
(20:54) laws bad why would Christian ethics stop flourishing when the theist mandate is to reprodu reproduce and the secular
(21:00) mandate is let's just all have sex and have fun bro that sounds way worse for
(21:05) human flourishing in fact I would say not reproducing is a worst possible thing for human flourishing because if there's no humans how do you flourish so
(21:12) I guess in essence step one I remain unconvinced step two I need to be convinced so I am no longer unconvinced
(21:20) and step three but God not real though doesn't matter here I've already granted it to still demonstrate just how stupid
(21:26) this ideology actually is with that I'll yield my time and I'm happy to get into
(21:32) it hey James I just sent you a message all right we are gonna kick it
(21:38) into an open discussion so uh 50 minutes and uh let's kick it no I don't think
(21:44) so I'm not going to sit here and dignify the preparation that I went through and
(21:50) what people work here for you're so indignant keep interrupting me I I am you're so indignant would the moderator
(21:56) like to step in so that I can finish what I'm saying please Matt please how dare someone have an opposing world I'm
(22:01) not going to sit here and dignify what was supposed to be a debate about Christianity versus secular humanism
(22:07) which one's better for the world yes with someone who clearly showed up with an agenda that has nothing to do with
(22:13) that I just someone who refers to trans people as deranged lunatics who will
(22:21) self-terminate if you dare to question them how am I wrong Matt someone someone who
(22:29) misrepresents a quote from a debate where I said I wouldn't make a law about nine-year-olds having sex being legal
(22:35) with respect to the 9-year-olds not that I was in any way in favor of it and that I was actually opposed to it which I
(22:40) addressed during that debate but moreover this is not remotely an honest
(22:46) interaction on the front of whether or not secular humanism is valuable because
(22:53) this when he presented his position here has nothing to do with secular humanism from from the get-go it's all about me
(23:00) Matt thinks Matt thinks Matt thinks I'm giving what Matt thinks what Matt thinks what Matt position Matt's position I
(23:06) came in with the secular humanist Manifesto I came in with positions that aren't just my that aren't merely my
(23:13) positions oh well as long as multiple people hold a position this guy's not serious and I'm leaving James if you want to refund you let me well good day
(23:20) sir and I'll cover your refund Mr Matt he just said he'd cover my refund I
(23:25) would cover his refund
(23:37) no I'm not going to dignify a debate with someone who walked in to trash talk people and be smug and all of the things
(23:46) that he's being right now he's already said he will cover my expenses you don't have anything to worry about this debate is over goodbye goodbye
(23:55) Jack did you call did you did you call me a jackass Matt well you and your husband have a
(24:01) good day Matt have a wonderful day
(24:08) mat yeah yeah no that was fine I mean if you're gonna take a Parting Shot I will
(24:14) too Matt yeah yeah thing is my parting shots correct no your parting shots
(24:24) correct oh man tough tough crowd tough crowd
(24:30) I am Sor that and do appreciate you
(24:37) coming our no you guys got to cover your own cost sorry so I agree that what
(24:44) Andrew said wasn't helpful in that well hold on just let me actually talk is
(24:49) like I'm already addressing it so you want to interrupt me still really yeah selfcontrol please so is Andrew like
(24:56) when you call people Luna it like that does come off as the
(25:01) presentation of a correct worldview so uh but I at the same time I can't help
(25:08) that Matt left like I would like Matt to refute and explain to Andrew like hey
(25:14) here's why calling people lunatics isn't an argument and this is intellectually
(25:20) low brow but I can't help that Matt left I'm sorry about that
(25:26) so uh if you want to email me I'm at modernday debate gmail.com I could even
(25:32) give you my number if you want to email me first and we can talk but I think we'd agree that you know calling people
(25:38) names isn't an argument and it's low brow I didn't call anybody any Nam at
(25:43) the same time my preference would be that Matt would kind of explain that for the internet to see like I think that's
(25:49) why we've hosted these debates is that there are bad arguments that they'd be exposed to the world like rebutted and
(25:55) exposed to the world but I I can't help I can't make Matt do something so I am
(26:01) sorry that we don't appear to have a headline debate
(26:07) tonight you want to ask Andrew questions if you guys would in spirit of
(26:14) debate you guys want to ask questions if you guys would like to engage with Andrew and challenge his calling people
(26:19) lunatics I am open to that if you guys would like to go ahead I think you well
(26:24) we do need to have you speaking on the mic though yeah do it say we can have somebody speak in the mic unless up there my goodness all right
(26:31) it's on you buddy so it seems like you lost the debate it seems like you didn't have an argument to begin with so I'd
(26:37) like to know so where's because I fled the debate stage yeah where's your like degree in Psychology to understand these
(26:44) like Concepts you need a degree in Psychology to know what a man and a woman are sir well apparently you need
(26:53) holds please I'm serious I'm going to toss people if this gets out of hand seriously I don't care I will carry you
(27:00) up myself so keep selfcontrol okay Andrew you have to let them ask a
(27:07) question pissed off everybody okay fair enough including me like for what you have to let them
(27:14) actually ask their question that's fair okay fair go ahead probably P being
(27:20) personal um so I didn't hear an argument against secular humanism I'm not
(27:26) necessarily on board with everything with the secular humanist Manifesto What
(27:32) specifically about the manifesto that he talked about do you find troubling it's
(27:38) all lies it's literally based on non-reality being subjectively interpreted as whatever you want you can
(27:44) make bold claims specific please I'm giving you a specific one if you sir
(27:50) believe that a man can be a woman and you can think that you can Gaslight the entirety specifically are you going to
(27:56) let me answer the question question or no go ahead if you want to try to Gaslight the entirety of humankind that
(28:02) this falsehood actually exists in descriptive reality and then say well
(28:07) that's science and we rule with science We Rule with our mind we rule with our brain that's absurd it's absurd how in
(28:13) the world can you want a Doctrine like that to run your life how where is that in the secular
(28:20) humanist Manifesto there he has no descriptor for
(28:26) what is true he has no justification for truth because he has no justification for truth they can make up whatever they
(28:32) want as being a truth claim in this case they make up what is a man and what is a woman do you understand yeah so you're
(28:38) making the presuppositional argument that you have to ground all beliefs in your belief in God which which made that
(28:44) argument I conceited his entire worldview to ask him one descriptive Claim about reality and he got so upset
(28:51) about the descriptive reality claim he fled the room you're being personal about it but uh what was personal
(28:58) when did I name anybody your your close your closing statement as he walked out
(29:03) I hope you and your husband have a good Oh you mean after he called me a name which was very personal when he called
(29:09) me a name first yeah so you're insulting his partner along with him why not if
(29:14) he's insulting you why don't you just directly insult how can how can it be an insult if I'm giving you a descriptive
(29:20) real true statement that's a real true statement how could you be insulted unless you know it's a
(29:26) lie how all right next one coming in good luck
(29:31) to you hey Andrew I um I'm I'm pretty
(29:37) religious myself um I I tend to keep to myself uh but uh one thing that I I've
(29:43) always been listening to or I can't really say the the verse really well I don't really remember it by heart but
(29:49) it's had something to do with along the lines of uh don't give uh swine don't give pearls to swine because they
(29:55) wouldn't know what to do with it not to call anybody who doesn't believe in religion I you just called the whole audience fne yeah sorry not not not
(30:03) that's just what the that's just what the I that's just the quote was uh basically saying don't uh you know push
(30:09) and try to convince someone if they're like unbelievers or they don't believe
(30:14) um you know so what kind of gets you fired up and want to try and uh tell
(30:20) them you know your position you know so my position has a requirement in truth
(30:27) it's one of the Commandments of Christianity it's one of the four things that we should focus on is what is true
(30:33) and yet people make these descriptive ridiculous descriptive claims and expect us look at how pissed off some of these
(30:39) people are because I told the truth what in the world did I say that was not true
(30:44) nothing there was nothing I said which is untrue and yet they're still that
(30:50) upset over what because they they don't have truth there is no truth on their
(30:56) side it's all bunch of lies and a facade and so when you tell them what's true
(31:01) they malfunction they go into NPC mode I was told man can be woman it's
(31:07) insane they can't it's nuts it's nuts yeah I just think that like uh that
(31:13) cannot go like hand inand like religion and secular humanism can go hand in hand if like you kind of just like you're not
(31:19) totally right you're not totally wrong but you know we're in America you can live the way you want I do have you know
(31:25) I do have a personal problem when you try to force it regardless if it's you know religion or um secular humanism
(31:32) when you try to force your beliefs and tell them like oh you're a bigot if you don't believe this or you're delusional
(31:37) if you don't believe this and stuff but you know it's just uh let's all get together be friends you
(31:43) know I'm not adverse to people having the most radical from me World Views on
(31:49) planet Earth I debate with them all the time professionally okay all the time professionally talk to him from all over
(31:55) the world I don't don't run away from their views I don't run away if they say think I find they're mean I tangle with
(32:04) them and their ideology and I destroy it because it's wrong it's a wrong ideology
(32:09) Matt knew what was coming the next thing was just a simple question and it would have led unfortunately for him to a
(32:15) place that nobody likes to go because societally it's become uncomfortable to tell the truth and his ideology clearly
(32:21) promotes the discomfort in telling the truth there is truth there's objective truth
(32:27) like at what point are we going to decide um you know that a 400b guy is
(32:34) skinny because he says he's skinny like there come on at some point you we have to use what he calls rationality and
(32:40) reason right all right next question hey Andrew uh so you just mentioned truth 80
(32:45) times it's true it's true it's true can you describe to us your process for finding truth yeah so the same as all
(32:53) Christians we gain truth through divine revelation the belief in God church history we have uh all sorts of
(33:00) different metrics that we can use which I'm happy to get into with somebody during a debate could have brought all those things up I would have been happy
(33:06) to go through each one of them and absolutely we can use these scriptures for what is true but even in the
(33:13) comments I don't think you and I would disagree in just the way that we kind of look at things what might be true or not
(33:20) true you know I think we can both look at a tree for instance and say you know what that's a
(33:25) tree the problem is when somebody goes no it's not man it's a rock and I no
(33:31) wait that's no it's not you know what I mean and they try to Gaslight you into believing that it is that's Insanity to
(33:36) to me that stuff is insane it's just pure Insanity one of the one of the ways that you mentioned that you you find
(33:42) truth is through divine revelation if two people have conflicting divine revelation how would you find truth
(33:48) between them yeah so that's a good question for Protestants so Protestants for instance I ask the Protestants the
(33:54) same exact question if you're imbued with the the Holy Spirit you're imbued with the Holy Spirit you're both reading the same passage and you come up with
(34:00) completely different answers to what that passage mean how do you know who's telling the truth how do you know which
(34:06) one of you is right it's the same exact criticism that I have luckily for us we have church history how find we have
(34:12) church history and Apostolic succession so we actually know what the Bible says right from the very beginning through
(34:17) Apostolic succession we don't have any disagreement because we yield to the authority of the church who's in
(34:23) Universal agreement except based on interpretation when you different based on based on interpretation yeah okay so
(34:30) what is the interpretation that you think that my church holds that you disagree with I I don't know what
(34:36) specific belief well then why would you even open your mouth about it makes no sense I'm I'm good thank
(34:42) you another question from ozian come around there just a final question um so
(34:49) what's it is it true that the topic today was Will secular humanism be
(34:54) Christianity or was it about transgender no the topic today was secular humanism
(35:01) versus Christian ethics Christians have an ethical duty to tell the truth and
(35:07) they the secular humanist does not as I just demonstrated live to everybody they
(35:13) have no absolutely no duty to tell anybody the truth about anything none
(35:20) well I think everybody can see on screen what the debate topic is and what he said was not the truth it says no no no
(35:27) that was not the debate topic even just an hour ago even just an hour ago that was not the debate topic
(35:33) so to be fair that is a question yeah regarding to the debate but yeah we will carry on the questions there given that
(35:39) this clearly wasn't the topic and you've been bodied on the issue before including by nominal Naomi a year
(35:46) ago why not on a new topic instead okay so first of all I I literally went
(35:54) through and said these people have no justification for their beliefs at all
(35:59) could have gone after that I went on to further explain here's how I can demonstrate that they have no justification for any of their claims
(36:05) here's how I can demonstrate they don't have truth on their side because I can show an example in real time of these
(36:11) people completely in totally lying to you totally lying to you and so many of
(36:17) you in the audience are like how dare you I'm not saying anything incorrect
(36:22) here you're being lied to I'm sorry I didn't say
(36:32) yes it is that we have to make sure that you're speaking to the mic or otherwise the
(36:37) online audience can't hear you do you want to come back on up all right that's not how myself or
(36:43) the commenters on those videos well nominal Naomi got obliterated on that topic and if you'd like the video
(36:50) evidence I've got seven times the views that nominal Naomi had and nominal Naomi backed out of a second debate with with
(36:57) me just letting you know just letting you know do we have any other questions
(37:02) from anybody in the chat or our audience here at the chat see I'm still in moderation mode my brain's gotten fried
(37:07) from all the traveling and that just happened so that's a little bit exciting isn't it well we are sorry of course
(37:13) that uh things didn't go to plan uh not sure if anybody's got some questions in the live chat or if anybody wants to come forward for more questions but uh
(37:19) if not then we'll wrap it up I think uh at this point if you had anything else you want to say there James we take a
(37:25) well you do have the we do have the poll that is correct
(37:32) R okay all right so if you if you're no longer neutral but you were earlier but
(37:39) now you're like why I lean this way now you can vote now if you're if you didn't
(37:44) vote earlier because you were neutral does that make sense okay all right so
(37:49) show of hands um who here has been swayed by the secular
(37:55) argument well and it and was secular coming in let's see those
(38:01) hands we'll take the ones that were secular or if you changed your mind leave it down that's fine if you changed your mind that's fine I mean I thought I
(38:08) thought we were going to try to figure out who's actually swayed here so we need everybody if anybody hands go up that didn't go up for the other side
(38:14) last time then we'll know and have you been swayed by the arguments for Christianity let's see a show of
(38:25) hands okay we got those results and also if you're watching online you can uh vote on our poll there you can see that
(38:31) it's shifting ever so back and forth as people are placing their bets and votes so uh we're going to close that out in a
(38:37) second and uh thanks everybody one thing I do want to do is in case there are any online questions people are interested
(38:43) in hearing sure did you guys want to yeah let's do that where is my phone
(38:48) that's a good question I need I need my device to uh
(38:54) pop these up guys there it is bear with me there live audience we've
(39:00) had a little a little mishap here it's not going entirely to plan but we're we're making it work all
(39:07) right yeah I got the fan chats here so just give me a second we'll read
(39:13) some of those out if it loads but if I get the mic oh you want
(39:20) the mic no so I do think I mentioned Andrew that uh not only is it like int actually low
(39:26) brow but as a fellow Christian calling people
(39:32) lunatics it doesn't seem productive so for me as a Christian like I have to say that I trusted you as a fellow Christian
(39:40) and when you call people lunatics you can see why I'm kind of like okay this is helpful now is it true
(39:46) that online sometimes there are you could say uh I don't want to paint with broad
(39:53) brush Strokes there are some pocket of secular people that might say like oh
(39:59) Christians are delusional and that's I get how that's like basically them calling them lunatics I'm not painting
(40:04) with broad brushstrokes that's pockets of secular people so but in either case I think we
(40:11) both agree like calling someone a lunatic or calling them uh delusional
(40:17) whatever it is whatever insult it is like it's not fruitful it's you know I mean it's not edifying it's not spiritually like encouraging someone or
(40:23) building them up so for me as a Christian I'm um you know I'm just like why
(40:31) Andrew because it's true James I can understand if you come that's why like
(40:37) CU it's because it's true that's why so but like I said in terms of the barbed
(40:43) approach though is that there are some Christians that have conservative theology including me uh that will come
(40:50) on and you know they'll State what they believe but they won't go further to to
(40:56) offend I mean for example like the gospel like we know what that means like this idea that Jesus died on a cross for
(41:02) people that's already offensive and so like which I don't mind you know if people are offended by that I don't mind
(41:08) they can take all of our symbols destroy them take them out of everywhere they can go online they can deface our Lord
(41:14) they can do any horrible thing to us that they can possibly imagine but lo and behold we tell the truth why I mean
(41:21) why allow why allow us to do that why allow us to do that that's that's where we should draw the line
(41:27) I've said my piece I'm going to you do have objections from online so uh some
(41:33) of these might be for Matt in which case Matt obviously is not here to respond so I'm not going to read if if it's for
(41:39) Matt because I don't want to I don't want to read something you can't respond to this one is
(41:49) from let's see actually a lot of these are more
(41:54) more of these are uh from M than I
(42:09) expected let's
(42:17) see study let's
(42:25) see what is your uh I'm an Orthodox
(42:30) Christian I don't think the questions that we have from online are uh a
(42:35) substantive or related so if anyone has questions in the inperson audience otherwise I think
(42:41) that's go ahead yeah I'll take it on over all
(42:48) right all right over to you yeah do you think that Jesus Christ would be proud
(42:54) of your behavior tonight I I think that anybody
(42:59) anybody who values Truth at all of any kind would not have a single dispute
(43:07) with what I said which is just objective reality descriptive objected it's no
(43:12) different than me saying the paint's white like do you think Jesus Christ would be okay with you saying the
(43:18) paint's yeah dude it's just objectively true but if you're like a prick about it I
(43:23) mean I I started so so it started as me being the prick I didn't call anybody a
(43:29) jackass he didn't personally insult dillah Hunty didn't say a word about anything about dillah Hunty related at
(43:35) all there was nothing nothing right hi Andrew this is less of
(43:42) a question and more of a statement as a followup to what his question was make sure it has of unor sorry sorry I'm
(43:49) trying to ask a question give me the most sorry sorry I'm trying to ask a question make sure it SE and dri I I do
(43:55) remember Jesus saying something like the least you do to my people you do to me
(44:01) mhm so I so the least so I told him the truth then that's that's what Jesus
(44:06) would be mad at uh so I am curious uh on your perspective of how far is is too far
(44:15) like uh for example like I go to a lot of like comic conventions and stuff and uh all the time I always see like a
(44:21) group of Christians always saying you guys are worshiping idolatry y'all are going to hell and I myself am pretty
(44:27) religious but I just go there for fun uh would you I mean they may or may not by
(44:34) their perspective they're telling the truth but many others might not believe that but I I guess the question is how
(44:39) far is too far like would you I think that was just walking over to him and saying do you think a rock is a rock and
(44:44) a tree is a tree is too far I don't think that's too far I think that walking over to him maybe and making
(44:50) threats or trying to do horrifying things to them I think that's too far but I think asking a basic question or
(44:56) saying something that's descriptively true like thing X is thing X and thing Y
(45:01) is not thing X I think that's fine why would they get even get upset about it yeah but I mean uh it's it's like going
(45:08) out of your way I mean for some people it's just a hobby you know creating something and just enjoying the time and
(45:15) then having someone on a megaphone just saying you guys are all going to hell because y'all are dressing up I mean if
(45:21) that's the case you know everyone who dresses up for Halloween would go to hell I mean people who dress up Santa
(45:26) Claus during Christmas time they should go to hell and pretend inside your scenario for a second that you disagree
(45:32) with these people and so they get a represent a representative for them one of the best representatives for their
(45:38) ideology they possibly could and then they set up some kind of like area where
(45:44) that representative and then a representative from the other belief were able to go and there was like some
(45:49) guy who was like moderating it and then both of them could hash it out and determine who was right like what what
(45:55) if we had that what if we had a situation like that but then still somebody could become so offended right
(46:02) just by a claim against their truth value that they run off why would you believe them why would you believe them
(46:11) Integrity what what about it is integrity to lie to people what's what's integral about that you just lied about
(46:18) he he listed it right there the the 9-year-old thing that you commented oh no would you like to see the video yeah I'd love to I have it peed right here
(46:25) the video you're wrong okay what did he say he made the argument that he would
(46:31) not be in support sorry come on over come on
(46:36) over he very plainly stated I I think it was with uh hi hikachu is that right
(46:42) yeah it was in a discussion with hikachu where hikachu goes goes off and like you said something that he clearly didn't
(46:48) say he was making the claim that uh you have claimed that it's perfectly fine
(46:54) for 9-year-olds to hook up this was not the case so not even close he this was
(47:00) in the debate with Daniel where he got up and got in Daniel's face or kind of also also sorry to interrupt but out of
(47:06) the two of them between Daniel and dillah Hunty who do you reckon is more in favor of kids I have no idea
(47:12) I don't pay attention to Daniel but in the Daniel in the in that particular debate to respond here's what actually
(47:20) happened and I'll bet you I'll tell you what if I'm wrong about this I will personally send you $50
(47:26) personally here's here's what actually happened what actually happened was he said yes or no Matt yes or no Matt is it
(47:34) okay or would you make laws sorry he says would you make laws would you make a law saying nine-year-olds couldn't
(47:41) have sex with each other by the way that's what I referenced in here too would you make a law saying nine-year-olds can't have sex with each
(47:47) other and he said if I have to do the yes or no thing then no I wouldn't make that law that's what was referenced that
(47:52) was what was referenced and what was the followup who what was the followup tell me he he said he said that he didn't um
(47:59) support 9-year-olds having sex but even even you said a similar thing when you
(48:06) were talking with Matt you said you would hold the parents negligent and the
(48:11) children so so you would put 9-year-olds in jail would put them in jail then you don't hold them criminally responsible
(48:18) 9year olds so you don't support criminal laws for 9-year-olds what you're saying here is not whether or not and by the
(48:25) way can be you can have a criminal law where nobody goes to jail what are you talking about do you think even under
(48:30) Christian ethics respond to my first stop I I've answered your questions answer one of mine do you have to go to
(48:37) jail when you're held criminally liable for something we do not no you do not
(48:42) but no you do not but we do not hold children criminally liable even under
(48:48) Christian ethics I think it's 13 years old it passes over to the parents the parents go to prison for negligible for
(48:53) being negligible even you agree with that you would not hold the children themselves criminally liable show me the
(49:00) clip of Matt saying the parents should go to jail for the kids having the sex not asked that question yeah but what do
(49:06) you think he would say if he was I don't know right well he not to ask he could have asked he could have he could have responded he doesn't support it he says
(49:13) you took me out of context why didn't he contextualize it we could have got into it and and I may be I may agree with you
(49:19) that maybe the criminal the parents should be held responsible for what the kids why you get mad at me I didn't
(49:24) leave the debate you knew well knew what I was doing audience wouldn't know what
(49:30) actually was said it's the wrong audience first of all first of all I was correct about what he said I I was
(49:37) correct about what he said that's what he said in that inter in that exchange later you say saying you were correct
(49:44) yes I was correct they can't Che you're yeah so if we're gonna if we're going to keep having back and forth we're going
(49:49) to have to come on up we just had this discussion with you and you maintain
(49:55) that you're correct not only am I correct accurately said and that it was a good
(50:01) idea to make that misrepresentation not only in front of it wasn't a misrepresentation it wasn't a
(50:06) misrepresentation that's his exact words you say clarified later but even the clarification does not get to the heart
(50:13) of what I responded to which is the negligence that you would hold the parents to if he wouldn't make a law
(50:19) saying nine-year-old if you and D Hunty agree how do you know we agree it sounds
(50:25) you do the tell the audience how we agree you just made the claim that the parents
(50:32) should be held accountable right sure dillah Hunty would believe I I can only
(50:37) how do we know he's not here just based on past comments oh based on P based upon what was said at the time I would
(50:44) suspect can't speak on his behalf but would suspect that he would make the claim that yeah parents should be held
(50:49) accountable if there's some sort of negligence I can't argue with what you suspect unfortunately I could have argued with
(50:56) his actual position but he left what do you think his actual position I think
(51:01) that he would say no that he would not actually criminalize the parents even for two consenting 9-year-olds to have
(51:07) sex that's what I believe he would say okay if two 9-year-olds if two
(51:14) nine-year-olds I think in his worldview were to do that deed I do not think that
(51:20) he would hold the parents criminally responsible for that no I don't think he would okay
(51:27) um I cannot possibly fathom why you would bring it up at all if that was
(51:35) your contention because that is so far from a big issue that might have to do
(51:41) with secular humanism well next time you can do the debate given that that seems to have some particulars around whether
(51:47) or not oh should the parents be held responsible to what extent were the parents involved and so forth
(51:53) because muddy it's not I'm trying to figure out why exactly it is that you
(51:58) would bring it up at all except for the express purpose of misrepresent what did Christian nationalism have to do with
(52:04) the debate then I'm sorry what did Christian nationalism have to do with the debate then Christian nationalis
(52:10) yeah he brought up Christian nationalism and went off about a congressman or I'm sorry somebody who's going to be the speaker of the house he went off on that
(52:15) for like I don't know five minutes yeah because this is an ethic that's being brought for for by people who consider
(52:21) the Christian so if you have some different ethics from that which I know that you don't if you have some
(52:28) different ethics from that system maybe you can present them to I just did and
(52:34) explained emphatically that we value truth and that I don't believe that under his system they do he he brought
(52:41) up as an example an institution or the formings of an institution Christian nationalism to criticize as an argument
(52:48) as an example of something he would be contrary against I brought up similar examples the other direction I didn't
(52:54) fle when he criticized Christian nationalism I didn't run out of the room when he criticized my worldview I didn't
(53:00) do any of those things I'm trying to figure out how your idea of Truth is
(53:05) different from your opinion backed up by an all powerful friend who knows
(53:10) everything and I granted that even if my opinion was nothing more than me
(53:16) appealing to Sky Daddy then it's just subjective relativism and is every bit as valid as his subjective relativism
(53:22) your moral system isn't subjective it isn't objective it is dependent upon Command right but let us assume for a
(53:29) second that I grant you that I'm just living under a delusion and the delusion is that I believe in a sky fairy and I'm
(53:35) totally delusional about the entire thing if that's true even if that's true
(53:41) then still from a subjective relativist position it's just as valid as their
(53:46) position it's just as valid so if it's just as valid and I just say something
(53:51) to him like well I don't believe in that  just based on whatever my own opinion is how's it less valid than
(53:59) his subjectivity and objectivity are not operating in the same way as taking
(54:06) Divine command as the basis of your inform gred that already and moral system yeah I granted it I'm not sure
(54:13) how it is you can claim that there's some sort of let's pretend that I made up an entire
(54:22) ethical system and just said there was a God I didn't believe in someone did let's just say that okay let's just say
(54:28) that that's true it's just as valid as whatever relativistic this guy comes up with same just as valid i' like
(54:35) to see some evidence for you to back up that your system is just as valid as somebody who's basing their ethics or
(54:41) their information objectivity or what kind of empirical evidence do you think we could demonstrate like could we maybe
(54:47) measure have could we maybe measure like the objective truth of things like would we start there would we start with what
(54:54) we think might be true we could you won't I did I don't think
(54:59) so I did I granted his worldview and acted as though I was a sec humanist who just decided that I believed in these
(55:05) views because I thought they made more sense ver beneficial beneficial versus valid
(55:11) you're saying your view is valid but is it beneficial is it useful does it have utility yes I think it's maximum utility
(55:16) to not lie to people I think that that has the maximum utility I think it has maximum utility not to hold people
(55:22) emotionally hostage and tell them that we will self-terminate if you don't validate an identity you know is a lie
(55:29) that is the worst thing you can do right yeah do you have positive relationships
(55:36) with your family members like I'm just asking like do you have people that love you in your life I
(55:43) don't it's a sad tale okay well then I can understand your worldview better it's a sad it's a sad tale
(55:50) well we got another I just will note that when we took the second
(55:56) vote at least one person that voted for the Christianity worldview mhm did
(56:05) not vote the second time oh well then I guess in the opinion of the biased people in the room then that means I
(56:12) lose then oh yeah I think so because I I
(56:18) stormed out I got up and ran out I fled the debate I was unwilling to engage it
(56:23) was all me it's all my fault you lost without even having to right what a bunch of cope a bunch of cope
(56:31) hang out no I think we're done with this guy heyone all right we're gonna wrap it up
(56:37) there um James did you want to make any other announcements anything you want to say before we close off for the night of
(56:43) course I think you guys know that it is daylight savings tonight so if you are
(56:48) coming back tomorrow do be sure to set your clocks or just have an idea of what
