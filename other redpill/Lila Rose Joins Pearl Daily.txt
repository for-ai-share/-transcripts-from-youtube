Title: Lila Rose Joins Pearl Daily

(0:00) ically no because men are useless this headline from The Hill it caught my

(0:06) eye most young men are single most young women are not young men have fallen faster than any demographic in America

(0:13) over the last 40 years it's a different world now like we don't need men the way that they used to nobody needs men the

(0:19) future is female men and women are drifting further apart

(0:25) and society is crumbling because of it a fascinating debate has broken out

(0:30) about the value of merit you've kind of got the tradcon versus red pill thing this men's rights crowd that sometimes

(0:36) just goes too far the other way you need to stop acting like grown boys and infants and actually become men marriage

(0:42) is a bond and it's a sacred bond it's a machine designed to extract resources from you now many of the red pill have

(0:49) taken the position that it's bad for men to get married hannah Pearl Davis or just pearly things

(0:56) one of the most controversial faces in all of the internet she goes on to say that marriage is a terrible deal for men

(1:03) because if me and you were in a business contract you would never sign a contract where I am paid to leave gee what could

(1:08) go wrong there 74% or something of divorces are initiated by women men have

(1:14) everything to lose primarily their own children men get killed by the courts and by divorce laws i had no idea that

(1:20) courts of family law were courts of equity not courts of law because in family court you don't need evidence to

(1:26) accuse someone of abuse you need no evidence when you guys say get married young a lot of these men don't know what they're signing up for and you're not

(1:33) going to be there when their entire life falls apart i interview them on the other side i didn't meet my son till he

(1:39) was 15 months old how much did you spend trying to get him back on legal fees alone was about 200,000 before you know

(1:45) it you're homeless you're literally just thrown out into the street we absolutely reinforce bad behavior from women wives

(1:51) are taught to leave their husbands and then daughters grow up without their fathers family is the foundation of the

(1:56) society every problem in society comes from single mother homes a lot of women will just chase this negative rabbit

(2:02) hole of happiness endless happiness feminism's biggest failures is it lies to women we tell women to date as many

(2:07) guys as possible we tell them to put off family in a marriage you are allowed to leave your perfect husband you are

(2:13) allowed to end a relationship with a really great boyfriend oh freeze your eggs have an abortion what you're evil i

(2:20) don't think there's anything else in life that we actually ever go into preparing to fail like if you have the mentality of this is going to go wrong

(2:26) and be pessimistic naturally the outcome is going to be that it's going to fail anyway it's self-sabotage and that's the

(2:32) thing like women are so willing to leave marriages because they're not happy this is not about happiness the most

(2:37) important thing is the children and the problem is we have a modern society where it's me me my feelings leave when

(2:44) I feel like it instead of doing what's best for the kids this myth that we live in an age of male

(2:50) privilege where's my male privilege they think well men have all the rights they have all the power privilege patriarchal

(2:56) system that we have why doesn't our society care about men's rights i have no friends no wife and no social men are

(3:03) alone in this situation men are homeless men are thinking about eating guns i've seen so many men on on the brink of

(3:09) suicide and they didn't do anything wrong how are you equal if the men are the ones that have to fight and die to

(3:16) defend the country the men are the ones that build and maintain all the infrastructure women are helplessly

(3:22) dependent upon men the so-called deaths of despair from suicide overdose or alcohol three times higher among men

(3:30) than among women culture is telling men you are no good you got to get your act together i think men have failed themselves what kind of a man are you

(3:37) what kind of a woman are you going to attract if men are in trouble so are women everybody knows this is a huge

(3:43) problem but nobody wants to admit it every single woman at the table said they wanted a man 500k 500k 300k 200k am

(3:50) I crazy everything is really set up against you to fail as a man if men make less than women women don't want to

(3:56) marry them so you know who wants more economically and emotionally viable men women

(4:02) i don't want to be an independent woman anymore i don't want to be a strong independent woman i'm over it when is it

(4:08) going to be my turn where are we meeting the men that don't suck i can't keep having these same conversations the only

(4:13) s here is you Pearl you sent for No I think I think you sent for women she's a provocator she says stupid stuff but

(4:19) Pearl is right about this it's already happening it's just not out in the open yet now it's just hookup culture is

(4:24) going to be our fairy tale ending because men don't want a wife and women can't find a husband the future if

(4:29) everybody follows your path is there is no future we go into population decline and our economy goes into decline

(4:36) civilization will crumble the American story does not end well this is an

(4:41) existential crisis failing young men

(7:25) all right how are you Lyla i'm good Pearl how are you i'm good um

(7:30) so I wanted to start I was going to Thanks for doing this yeah no problem i was going to give you your intro is that

(7:36) all right oh yeah go for it okay okay so Llaya Rose guys president of Live Action

(7:42) um a prolife nonprofit she's got almost 300,000 subscribers and runs a prolife

(7:47) YouTube channel did I miss anything Laya thank you that sounds good thanks Pearl

(7:52) okay cool um so thanks for coming on i know we went back and forth a little bit

(7:58) on Twitter but I do enjoy having conversations with people that we have different ideas on um so I do appreciate

(8:06) you coming on the show i appreciate that and I I thank you for being willing to dialogue with me and grateful for that

(8:12) and thanks for having me on cool um so I guess I wanted to flesh out a

(8:18) little bit of your ideas on different topics that may maybe have different um points of view on so um I wanted to

(8:25) start with abortion so I wanted to see what your stance is on abortion

(8:31) sure well abortion and we'll define it quickly because there's sometimes some media confusion that they try to throw

(8:37) confusion into the topic but abortion is the direct and intentional killing of a baby it's always wrong and that's

(8:44) because it's always wrong to kill an innocent human being and a child in the womb is an innocent human being so this

(8:50) is the greatest human rights issue that we're facing I believe as a country there's 3,000 babies killed every single

(8:55) day by abortion it's devastating our entire social fabric there's a million

(9:00) babies killed every single year and this has been a a mission for me since you

(9:05) know teen years basically since I was a kid thankfully our movement has grown but we have a ton of work to do because

(9:11) there's a lot of people who are blind on this issue and there's a lot a lot of laws that we need to change to protect

(9:17) children and to create a culture of life so what laws would you want to change

(9:22) well I think first off there should be complete abortion bans so there needs to be complete abolition of abortion and

(9:29) complete legal protection for the pre-born child that's the most important law and then I think there's also public

(9:35) policies we could do to make America a friendlier place for families more tax credits and cash quite frankly cash uh

(9:42) money given directly to families who have children so that it's easier to raise families so there's a lot of

(9:48) pro-life positive public policy but the biggest thing is we need to protect babies in the womb from abortion okay so

(9:54) when it comes to enforcing that do you think that women should be put in jail who have abortions

(10:00) i think that yeah if somebody is intentionally willfully with full knowledge pursuing the crime of killing

(10:06) the baby whether that's a woman or she's someone else outside of her it's a man who's p pushing that on her another

(10:12) woman the abortionist obviously committing the act there should be criminal penalties for that okay and so

(10:18) we would agree then life in prison similar to like aborting um an adult we would agree i mean I think it's not

(10:25) killing an adult by that sorry go ahead yeah I that's okay i think it depends i mean every every state has different

(10:31) kinds of homicide laws and there's different penalties depending on different circumstances different degrees of murder so I think it'll

(10:37) depend i mean right now for example if you commit infanicide you kill a newborn

(10:42) baby right and you do it with full intent and full knowledge there wasn't some sort of mental health issue right

(10:48) you could get a very significant prison sentence and I think we need to have justice like that to protect life and to

(10:55) make sure we're valuing life in our laws so I think it's going to depend case by case but overall yes of course we should

(11:00) have legal protections and that would include penalties for those that willfully intentionally with full knowledge there's not some like mental

(11:06) health issue or coercion issue um going on that I think that is an important part of our legal system and should be a

(11:12) part of our legal system what is a coercion issue well so a lot of abortions

(11:18) unfortunately there's a coerc coercive aspect where and and this is reporting that we've done at live action now for

(11:24) over a decade where especially if there's a situation of sexual abuse or u you know an abusive relationship

(11:30) generally speaking sometimes there's going to be a partner a man involved usually not a husband as a boyfriend who

(11:36) is pushing for that abortion and so if there's you know a a woman who's basically being coerced into having that

(11:43) abortion she's being threatened that you know I'm going to kill you if you don't do this um she's being you know driven

(11:48) to the abortion clinic kicking and screaming things like that then of course when you're uh looking at abortion you know pro-life laws there

(11:55) should be penalties for that for coercing someone into having an abortion and and different studies that have been

(12:00) done it's about up to a third of women report that they felt coerced into having their abortion and there's a lot

(12:06) of cases of this you know boyfriends throwing abortion drugs into the girlfriend's drink saying she has to

(12:12) have the abortion she you know has an abortion because her the pills were put in her drink those sorts of really

(12:17) tragic situations and that that is an element of abortion today right but there's no law that a man could put a

(12:24) gun to a woman's head and make her get an abortion it it's 100% her choice at the end of the day outside of like

(12:31) throwing something in her drink right which is the equivalent of like roofy you know but outside of that

(12:38) well yeah yeah i mean there's not a law saying you're saying there's not a law that says the man gets to decide that's true like in today's like today you know

(12:46) just to be clear I mean to on the flip side separate the coercion can go the other direction right so the the man

(12:52) could be coercing the woman to have the abortion the woman could be coercing the man that I'm going to have this abortion

(12:57) whether you like it or not and that also tragically happens horribly men have no rights when it comes to protecting their

(13:04) baby so you can be a man today you know your b your the girlfriend's pregnant with your child you have no rights to

(13:10) protect that child she goes and have an abortion you don't you don't even have to give have knowledge of it that also tragically happens it's horrific and and

(13:16) I I totally agree but I think where I would have a difference of opinion is I think that's just a get out of jail free

(13:22) card that women use when they don't want to take accountability for the choice that they made it's really easy what is

(13:28) a get out of what are what is a get out of jail free card what do you What are you talking about specifically but what

(13:33) what I've noticed with traditional conservatives and with whenever women do

(13:38) something terrible they have a tendency to blame the men when they can and so I

(13:45) I think it's [ __ ] that women can say "Oh I was coerced into something." When

(13:50) women have every right under the law like there's no way a man can put a gun to a woman's head um without severe

(13:58) consequences in making her get an abortion so I see what you're saying yeah i think well I think we hold on I

(14:04) think we agree that of course it should be illegal and it is largely speaking to

(14:09) physically harm someone you know outside of the womb anyway it's not a baby in the womb they're they're they're up for

(14:15) being killed which is horrific right but yeah I mean technically if a woman is you know physically dragged to an

(14:20) abortion clinic or threatened she could you know probably have a legal case against him and it would be great if she

(14:25) could pursue that they don't always get pursued so that's a problem but the reality is abortion involves coercion

(14:31) often on one or the other side and that's another element of just us allowing the killing of babies in this

(14:36) country and that anybody has a consent to kill the baby is wrong no one should

(14:42) have that right to kill there's no right to kill and nobody should be pressuring anybody into an abortion so think we're

(14:48) aligned on that no I don't think I hope we're aligned on that i agree i'm just curious if you agree with that and I I'll get into it but I don't think like

(14:54) necessarily right because Okay so if I wanted to get an abortion I personally I

(15:00) would never right i I don't believe in it yeah personally wouldn't but let's say tomorrow I change my mind and

(15:07) I want one um what can my my boyfriend

(15:12) can he legally stop me no and that's part of the that's part of the horror of

(15:18) this right we just did a piano but the other way around like if he wanted me to get one and I wanted to have the kid he

(15:25) he can't do anything well unfortunately in many cases there are coercive situations where there's

(15:32) abuse and they do try to do something so that that does happen it's you could say

(15:37) it's technically illegal like she could call the cops and say "Get him out of here." But in a lot of domestic abuse

(15:43) situations you know even calling the cops doesn't always work for multiple reasons there's a lot of complexity there so it's just another sad dark part

(15:50) of our culture today unfortunately but how like how is how how is calling the

(15:56) cops not a solution well I mean I don't know how much you Yeah go ahead i don't know how much

(16:02) you've kind of looked in so Live Action News reports on some of these cases right and so I don't know how much you might look into it but in in cases where

(16:08) there's sort of this um there could be overt pressure which would be you know I want to kill you if you don't have this

(16:15) abortion right or there's a sexual abuse victim like a young girl which we've documented this in multiple cases

(16:21) there's actually court cases of like 12 and 13 year old girls who their stepfather or their soccer coach got

(16:28) them pregnant drove them to the abortion clinic to get the abortion um you know that was part of continuing the cycle of

(16:34) abuse underage is a different conversation but I'm talking about of age so like 18 i'm not sure I'm not sure

(16:42) where you're going with this or what you're trying to uh how we might disagree do you think we

(16:47) disagree on something I've said or yeah because what do you disagree on i disagree with saying that a woman can be

(16:53) coerced into getting an abortion i disagree okay because the women have the police on their side and we have um all

(16:59) of the laws are on our side so there's nothing that a man can like he can tell you to go get one but you can say no f

(17:06) you and not and I would encourage every woman in a sit and I hear what you're saying and I

(17:11) think I do think the kind of potential language of empowerment you're using of like ladies like if you're feeling

(17:18) pressure like buck it like forget it like this guy has no power over you you stand up and fight for the life of your baby that is one of the prevailing

(17:25) messages of live action for women whether it's a boyfriend whether it's their parents whether it's the doubts in

(17:31) the back of their mind that are thinking oh I need this abortion otherwise my life is over whatever it is no don't

(17:36) listen to that voice don't listen to that pressure you have the power to choose life you have the power to fight

(17:42) for your baby so yeah I agree with you that that is that should be the ultimate message to women we should fight for our

(17:47) babies and love them and we have the ability to do that we have the we have the ability to do that now any woman can

(17:53) do that yeah i think where we disagree is I watch what women do not what they say and so just because a woman says she

(18:00) was feeling a certain way that doesn't mean she's telling the truth it's like anyone can feel i mean that's

(18:06) certainly possible for some women yes a lot of women yeah yeah i mean depends on

(18:12) on on the women you talk to but yeah there's going to be some women who you know may feel a certain way and not act

(18:17) by their feelings or you know certainly people do can blame other people for their actions i think that can happen so

(18:24) I know you I know that you know from what I know of your content I know you say you know you have a lot of broad sweeping statements about you know men

(18:31) at large or women at large and you know women kind of are I I don't know I don't want to put words in your mouth but um

(18:37) and certainly there are bad bad actors out there doing bad things so I'm not going to act like there aren't okay um

(18:44) so the next question I have is what is your timeline on when you think abortion

(18:50) will be banned so I my my work our work on this in this

(18:57) fight I believe it will be within our lifetime for sure um I think that even under this current administration you

(19:04) know we were very disappointed that you know there's some progress being made but the Republican party right now has

(19:10) made a lot of compromises on this so we have to work to reestablish protection of life in the Republican party and

(19:16) obviously convince the Democrat party to fight for life that's a big fight right there because most Democrats are proabortion but I do think that there

(19:23) are you know every day little shifts happening you know people when they learn about abortion when they learn

(19:29) about the evil of it there is a lot of conversions that are happening so that's the focus of live actions work primarily

(19:34) more than public policy even is changing hearts and minds and it's a it's a difficult task of course Pearl because I

(19:40) mean as I'm sure you've seen there's a lot of toxicity in our culture today there's a lot of lies people you know

(19:46) post sexual revolution I think people are just very damaged and so we've come

(19:51) to accept abortion as this normal thing and we've also come to accept you know sex outside of marriage and sex outside

(19:58) of a loving lifelong commitment as normal like oh yeah of course people hook up of course that's normal that's sort of a prevailing societal attitude

(20:04) today and that's what leads to abortion right because people think oh I'm going to have sex without consequences i can

(20:10) do what I want and then of course you know sex can lead to new life even with

(20:15) contraception and that's what happens again and again and that's why we have 3,000 babies killed every day that is

(20:20) the backup contraception today abortion yeah so that's you know this is the kind of the larger societal issue and so

(20:26) anyways back to your question of are we going to ban abortion i believe we will it is it is going to happen but there's a lot of work we need to do to change

(20:33) hearts and minds and to change uh really how we operate as a society where we

(20:38) instead of looking at sex as cheap the hookup culture is the way to go we

(20:43) celebrate marriage and say no marriage is is a good thing and sex belongs

(20:49) within marriage and children are gifts they're blessings and would you agree that it's a would you agree it's a

(20:54) losing cause that when women have aborted an eighth of when women have aborted an eighth of

(21:00) the world population an eighth like one out of eight people like the most dangerous place you can be is in your

(21:06) mother's womb yes it's horrific hor horrible so like wouldn't you say I

(21:12) agree yeah like wouldn't you say it's a losing cause no i don't think it's a losing cause at all and I see people

(21:18) change on this issue i see former abortionists become passionately pro-life and start crusading for

(21:24) pro-life laws i see women who had they do it when it's convenient see that's

(21:30) the I I disagree with that i don't think it's a convenient sacrifice a lot no I've seen

(21:35) um I've seen the one lady that um work like and this is just what I I see tend

(21:40) to happen and I think it really um detract you might have good intentions right but I think it often detracts from

(21:47) the message is you know it's very convenient to say after you've aborted

(21:53) like I think there's one woman she aborted two kids and then became like a speaker and I'm just thinking it's very

(21:58) convenient that now that you can make money as a pro-life speaker that you're conveniently now you're pro-life and I

(22:06) just see that pattern where a lot of people it's very convenient when they choose to be pro-life it could be a true

(22:13) change of heart possible but yeah go ahead yeah I I totally disagree i think

(22:18) today it actually is inconvenient more than convenient to be pro-life because there's so much societal infrastructure

(22:26) and pressure to actually be proabortion so I think it's actually it's not like oh being pro-life you know we're working

(22:32) on making pro-life mainstream i think we've made actually a lot of progress Pearl which I'm proud of there's a lot more work to do you know 3,000 babies

(22:39) dying every day is an an emergency of the greatest level maybe it's over the counter now like I don't know if there's

(22:46) been like in my lifetime I would say in the past 10 years it's become easy i

(22:51) mean I know there was Row versus Wade i'm I'm sure you're going to say that but even so I mean I've been to some of

(22:58) these feminist like conventions they they just they ship the abortion stuff

(23:03) in the mail you can get Plan B over the counter like if you think plan B is abortion I don't really see any progress

(23:11) at all well and if you're speaking about the abortion pill that is now over half of abortions and that's can be shipped

(23:16) by mail because we don't have regulations and the pill is even on the market i mean the fact that the abortion

(23:22) pill is on the market that happened under Clinton in the 1990s and then under Biden they took off all the

(23:27) regulations and now you can literally order an abortion pill in the mail yeah that's horrific and that's only going to

(23:32) you know that leads to the normalization of oh it's just a pill you know it's not just a pill by the way one out of every

(23:38) one out of every 24 one out of every 24 women who take the abortion pill end up in the emergency room one out of every

(23:44) 10 of them have serious complications and 100% of those babies virtually are being murdered right so it's a it's a

(23:51) huge issue but I I don't think it's convenient just just back to what you're saying originally you know I I don't

(23:56) think it's somehow like convenient to go out there and be a pro-life uh speaker like many women are and many men are

(24:03) quite frankly um I think it's a beautiful work that they do and I I wish there were more people out there

(24:08) advocating for life i Yeah I disagree because I see YouTube numbers like I

(24:13) know what you guys get paid to speak at a lot of these places and like and maybe

(24:18) I'm off by 10 20% but it's good money and a lot of them are getting paid very well

(24:24) so yeah I mean I think it's Yeah I just wouldn't say I I don't think I think

(24:29) it's one thing to pay people for you know work and they're giving a speech or things like that but you know the people

(24:34) that I know in the Prolife movement they're not doing this because oh this is my way to make all this money they're

(24:39) doing this because they are passionate about saving lives and thankfully again there's a lot of beautiful work being

(24:45) done i mean I think about the pregnancy resource care center movement thousands of pregnancy resource centers across the

(24:50) country more than Planned Parenthoods more than abortion clinics they don't get taxpayer dollars they're not the

(24:56) ones like Planned Parenthood getting you know $800 million a year from taxpayers and they're literally saving lives every

(25:02) day in our communities they don't have a big marketing budget the way that Planned Parenthood does plumbing has like hundreds of millions of dollars to

(25:08) lie to people and spend a market you don't have to convince me that pro-life is like a good or abortion wrong i think it's I just what I what I what I'm doing

(25:16) curl is I don't want to discourage people from joining the pro-life movement and I would say I think we need more professional people in the pro-life

(25:22) movement who are advancing the cause planned Parenthood has you know a tremendous amount of money that they're

(25:28) investing professionally in developing the proabortion lobby so I would argue we need actually more resources in the

(25:33) prolife movement we need more people who are professionally engaged in the pro-life movement in order to advance the cause of the unborn but the

(25:40) challenge is we see this abolition and changing hearts the challenge is most people see this as a losing cause like

(25:46) nobody really sees the pro-life movement as having really won much in the past 50

(25:52) years and I would I would say wait I'm going to I would say a lot of people that hypothetically could or would be

(25:59) you know when you say like oh it'll maybe be banned in our li I do believe it'll be banned in our lifetime it's

(26:04) like it's kind of like you know if you have an employee and you're like when is this project going to get done and

(26:09) they're like "Well maybe in our lifetime," you're like "Well I don't know if you're winning right?" And in my

(26:15) and you know it's one thing to like obviously you're going to list the stats or what you know give anecdotal stories

(26:22) but when I look outside you know one out of three women have had an abortion and we're getting

(26:28) pills in the mail now and I think it's disgusting but I just see it as a losing call like I just I I see it as you guys

(26:35) lost well here's a here's a few things to consider Pearl hopefully to encourage you so first of all there are 12 states

(26:41) that have banned abortion that's a big deal in 12 states it is illegal to kill a baby and that is huge progress and

(26:47) they reported that after Roi Wade fell another huge victory just just three years ago Roie Wade was overruled now we

(26:54) have you know the opportunity to protect life that's a huge opportunity there were 40,000 more babies born the next

(27:01) year than the year prior that otherwise would have been killed if abortion hadn't been made illegal so lives are

(27:07) being saved on a daily basis because of pro-life laws and we have a lot more work to do but that is that is a good

(27:13) thing that we have looked into that though and they saw that that women are going to other states to get the

(27:19) abortion and plan B sales are going up i just don't see a baby boom coming

(27:24) anytime soon in fact I see the birth rate going down i see if if abortion

(27:29) decreases I I looked into this um plan B increases so I think you're talking

(27:36) about the abortion pill right um you're saying more abortion pills well there's

(27:42) plan B and then there's the abortion pill i believe those are you would you know they're different things yeah so so

(27:47) here's the thing i I hear what you're saying and yes there is you could call it like the black market and this is

(27:52) going to happen even after abortion is banned you know when we ban something like murder fraud rape whatever

(27:59) sometimes the bad thing still happens to some degree right so I'm not going to say oh it's possible to make sure that

(28:04) no one ever commits any sin again that's not possible right in this life you know before one day hopefully on our on our

(28:10) journey to heaven we can be perfected you know by God's grace right but we can fight towards justice and we should

(28:16) fight towards justice for our laws in our society and in in Texas as an

(28:21) example Texas banned abortion and the birth rate did go up in Texas Pearl despite the fact that yes some women

(28:27) went out of state you know my state of California horrific saying like one I I think the number was around 40,000 more

(28:33) lives one one kid per because we're at like 1 point something for the birth rate so what to 1.8 the birth the birth

(28:40) rate is very low it's below replacement rate but my point is lives are being saved that's my point and that's a good

(28:47) thing celebrate every single one of those lives and I'm not saying that's a bad you know I'm all for it but you have to

(28:54) understand that still sounds like a losing cause to me like it doesn't sound

(28:59) like you guys are winning here here's another perspective for you so throughout human history and certainly

(29:05) in American history there have been a number of injustices or abuses right m and I remember uh studying the history

(29:11) of social reform to look at different injustices like let's look at slavery as an example in America there were a lot

(29:18) of people slavery was deeply embedded in at least you know the entire southern

(29:23) part of America right it was a core part of the economy it was a po core part of the culture people thought it was normal

(29:29) you know people thought there's no way we're going to eradicate slavery there is no way and the abolitionists at the

(29:35) time were told that as much they said there's no way you're going to solve this problem there was a lot of you know reasons that they had for that we could

(29:41) get into it doesn't doesn't matter the point is they said there's no way and people said "We're going to make a way we're going to fight for this even if

(29:47) it's difficult even if people tell us it's you know it's not going to happen we're going to believe that it can

(29:52) happen and we're going to work to you know change hearts and minds we're going to work to protect life ultimately." And

(29:58) in the end yes through a lot of you know yes there was a horrific civil war but in the end we were able to eradicate

(30:04) slavery later on eradicate Jim Crow that took time it took a lot of You know what

(30:09) the difference was then you know what the difference was then though right it was successful do you know what the difference was then right

(30:17) sorry can you say one more time did you say do you know what the difference is yeah do you know what the difference was back then well how how do you see the

(30:24) difference women didn't vote women have too much power i I don't think that's the reason we had slavery because women

(30:30) No I'm saying men have a tendency to have moral could you not you're a Misha

(30:36) you know you got to got to let me talk are you saying that women just make sure I'm tracking you i'm saying that men

(30:41) have a tendency and not all i'm on YouTube so I have to I have to say not

(30:46) all but men have a tendency to do the right thing where women have a tendency to do the wrong thing and so now that

(30:53) women have had all this voting power the last hundred years I mean really uh you

(30:59) know abortion's gone up promiscuity's gone up and the family units gone down

(31:05) so I just could not see something that is so moral being passed in my lifetime

(31:12) because women are the primary voting block and as you said earlier Democrats and Republicans

(31:18) um they they both have to cater to women that that's the challenge we're going to

(31:24) have and that's why I'm what I'm not saying is that the pro-life movement is

(31:30) bad or wrong or that even but I do see them as ineffective and a losing cause i

(31:35) don't really I think Row versus Wade was the last victory they'll really have in

(31:41) our lifetime and I also believe um that we really have better things to worry

(31:47) about because it's been so ineffective yeah I just totally disagree i think

(31:53) every life saved is worth celebrating and we're saving more as we go and this thing about women voting and you know

(32:00) that's led to all the problems i mean slavery existed in America before women could vote so I'm not sure your argument

(32:07) follows that oh before women voted you know everything was hunky dory in the US no I didn't say that so the argument is

(32:13) that men will um do something moral even at the cost of themselves

(32:19) so even like they they will vote or pass something that is morally right even if

(32:25) it's at a cost to themselves at times women are not the same way they vote very selfishly and abortion gives women

(32:32) power over who is born so they're just never going to give that up ever

(32:37) i think you're casting really big generalizations about men versus women

(32:43) and I think you're kind of speaking to maybe the virtue of fortitude where people do you know are courageous or do

(32:48) what's right even when it's hard but I think women can have that virtue different well let me just finish what I

(32:53) was going to say i think women can have that virtue too so I don't think that there's like an exclusively male virtue to do what's right or an exclusively

(32:59) female virtue to you know be loving or something like this um so I disagree with the broad strokes that you're um

(33:05) you know painting here but I I would ask you you know it sounds like we agree which is a good thing that abortion is

(33:10) murder abortion is horrible abortion is wrong we agree on that and if we agree on that I guess my question to you Pearl

(33:17) be why wouldn't you want to fight that even if it would only help save one life wouldn't it be worth it to you to still

(33:22) speak out against it to still advocate for the rights of those children well I and I think this is what women have a

(33:27) tendency to do is they think that talking into a microphone like saves lives right i don't really believe again

(33:34) I don't believe the pro-life movement is effective i think it's easy to like take the credit but I think that women that

(33:40) don't want to abort their kids will find the resources to not the same way somebody that wants to lose weight will

(33:47) find the resources to not do that i think if they found your organization they really didn't want to do it to

(33:53) begin with because like you know women aren't aborting NBA players kids or like

(33:58) rich men's kids in general i mean there's broad strokes obviously um and I

(34:04) also don't really understand the I think that's totally untrue by the way but I I don't know where you're getting that

(34:09) from uh women steal viral story women steal

(34:15) condoms women Women steal condoms Laya from the NBA so So this was this was a

(34:22) problem this was a problem where they had to issue out statements telling men to throw away their condoms because

(34:28) women were stealing it i don't think it's untrue that women have a tendency to try to get kids off of wealthy men um

(34:36) if anything you congratulated Ashley St clair for doing that exactly you you

(34:41) congratulated her when she was pregnant by Elon Musk's baby which she planned for years so I don't know when it's in

(34:48) front of your face how you can deny that happens so well a couple things first of all

(34:54) when it comes to congratulating you're mentioning Ashley Sinclair for her baby i think any baby's existence is a

(35:00) beautiful gift and deserves celebration so that's the first thing I'll say the second thing no matter how they were

(35:06) conceived Pearl no matter how they were conceived they are a gift from God and they deserve a right to life and they

(35:11) deserve celebration but then another thing I'll say is you you you seem to be continually you know doing these broad

(35:18) brush strokes of all women this all women that all men this all men that i don't think that's reality i don't think

(35:24) that's reality and I think it's really unhelpful to you know paint such broad

(35:29) brushes because certainly there are women that do terrible things certainly there are men that do terrible things

(35:35) but I don't think it's going to be useful ultimately to say all men are this way all women are this way why

(35:41) don't we focus on the argument instead of why don't we focus argument instead

(35:46) instead of tone policing because you're like right now you're basically saying I don't like the way you said it which is

(35:51) fine but that's what I'm saying i'm saying what you're saying is untrue there's a difference what is how you're saying that did Ashley St clair not try

(35:59) to get a kid off of Elon Musk did that not happen that That's not what I was talking about i was talking about you

(36:05) saying women are all like this women always do this that's not what I said though okay no you you claim something

(36:12) untrue so tell me exactly what I said the characterization that all women try

(36:18) to do X right i said they have a tendency i said have a tendency well I I I just disagree that all women have this

(36:25) tendency to go after rich men and try to whatever you were saying you know I don't think that's true i don't think

(36:31) that's true okay well what data do you have to prove it well I can I can have

(36:37) you meet at least I know hundreds of women personally that that's not how they behave so right there I just you

(36:43) know I proved you wrong because there are many I know someone that's not a good argument Laya i mean it might work

(36:49) on them if you're saying on the tra people you argue with it doesn't work on me like you know they just so if you're

(36:57) saying all women have this tendency but they're not all women are not doing that then I think that that is not a correct

(37:03) characterization tend to divorce men that they outearn women tend to marry

(37:09) men and have children with men that earn aren't you conservative protect provide

(37:14) you don't want provider men I I think that's good i'm not sure how

(37:19) that connects back to what we were just talking about but yes I think it's wonderful when men provide okay um the

(37:26) other thing you said I said where are you going with all this because I I am curious if I may ask you another question you know you're saying the

(37:31) prolife movement has you know no hope and it's pointless but I just explained

(37:38) I said it's ineffective well you were saying it's ineffective but I just explained to you that as one example

(37:45) there have been there were 40,000 lives saved when Roie Wade fell roie Wade would not have fallen without the

(37:51) pro-life movement so are those 40 lives 40,000 lives in your view not they don't

(37:57) matter that that that that means that the pro-life movement is ineffective because those 40,000 lives were saved i

(38:02) believe that those women if they wanted to have a child they would have it and if they didn't want to have a kid they

(38:08) wouldn't i think oftent times um people on the internet have a tendency to think

(38:14) and attribute everything to themselves but the same way that um the the same

(38:19) way like if I was a personal training um page right and somebody found me to lose

(38:25) weight if they didn't find me they would have found somebody else they wanted to lose weight i believe that when women

(38:32) women I I believe ultimately your actions show what you want to do not what you say but what you actually do so

(38:40) that's how I What would be your what would be your recommended solutions to abortion to to save lives what would you

(38:45) do i don't think it's solvable unfortunately i think women are r women have a tendency have a tendency to be

(38:52) ruthless um and I've shown women videos of abortions and with a cold face they

(38:58) don't care i've met women that have had five abortions they do not care women are very callous and cold um I mean

(39:05) there's a reason women even when a kid's born in the first year if there is an infanticide I'm sure you know the stat

(39:11) the most likely person to do it is the mother the most p likely person to abuse a child when it's one of the biological

(39:18) parents is the mother so women are vi women are far more

(39:24) violent than society gives them credit for they're also the most likely to abuse the elderly when it comes to

(39:30) killing the innocent oh my gosh women are ruthless um I think you could try to logic women uh that's a strategy i don't

(39:38) think it's an effective one because I don't think they care and the reason I don't think they care is because you

(39:45) know I've been pro-life from a young a like quote unquote pro- like I I haven't believed in abortion from a young age

(39:50) and it's because I wanted to find the I I wanted to find the information right i

(39:56) I want it's on Google there's nothing stopping a woman from finding that information but they choose to not

(40:03) because they don't want to so I don't see women stopping killing their kids ever ever i I mean Pearl by your logic

(40:11) let's be real here Pearl by your logic you're saying women are so evil they're going to kill no matter what they kill

(40:16) their born children too let me just finish please the world population that's pretty bad let me just finish Pearl give me one second here by your

(40:23) logic we should just get rid of murder laws we should just get rid of laws that govern the behavior of women because

(40:29) they're so bad they're going to always do bad stuff and I say absolutely not the law is a teacher the law does have

(40:35) power it doesn't mean everybody perfectly will follow the law i would love that laws i totally would love for it to be

(40:42) illegal if it was up to me well good i'm glad we agree on that much we would agree but it doesn't mean that I think

(40:48) it'll happen and I think what I often hear conservatives I mean start what I often hear what I can I finish so and I

(40:55) often hear conservatives say is they say the word should well should is just a wish list it's just I wish that would

(41:02) happen and you know anyone that's like run a company or or you know you know

(41:07) like if I went to an army general and said "There shouldn't be war." He would say "Wow that sounds nice well what's

(41:13) your plan how are we going to end this war in the next year?" And he says "Well I think it'll happen in my lifetime." If

(41:19) I was the general I would say "I don't know if I don't know if we're going to win this war that's not a great

(41:25) strategy." And what I've heard just really aren't the best strategies and I

(41:30) I don't know if there is a way to win because women have too much voting power

(41:36) well listen I think that the kind of argument you're making that it's so difficult there's so much entrenched

(41:42) interest for why people would want abortion and so they're not going to we're never going to get rid of it you

(41:47) could make that argument about other human rights abuses historically you can make that argument about racism and Jim

(41:52) Crow you could make that argument to about slavery it was certainly a very uh there's a huge financial interest for

(41:58) slaveholders so you can make those arguments about other evils that we have overcome historically so I think it

(42:05) really is going to come down to willpower and it's going to come down to a lot of grace from God i don't think that this is just a you know physical

(42:12) battle this is a spiritual battle too it's going to come down to a lot of supporting the needs of people and

(42:17) education and it is going to come down to the law and so we're going to continue to work i mean I I'd love to

(42:22) have your your support and backing Pearl i get it that you know you're saying it's a helpless fight but we're we're going to keep crusading and we're going

(42:29) to continue to work so that's not just 12 states that bans abortion but that it's 13 states and then 14 states and 15

(42:35) states we're going to continue the crusade until every child the crusade is an eighth of the world population

(42:42) aborted i just don't think you're winning i don't think you're close like that's my point i I wish you I think

(42:48) there's a lot of work to do i agree with you but I think there's been a lot of victories as well and we're going to keep working well yeah i just I would

(42:55) get a better plan than maybe it's like in the next year we'll achieve this this and this you know then you might then

(43:02) you might we'll keep working on it Pearl trust me every day that's the that's the question of how do we do this more

(43:08) strategically i mean right now the big fight I'll just tell you is defunding Planned Parenthood and I'll explain why they're getting $800 million every

(43:15) single year from taxpayers i mean they're an almost $2 billion group you look at the pro-life movement the total

(43:21) amount of resources in the prolife movement including all the pregnancy resource centers you're talking completely is dwarfed by Planned

(43:27) Parenthood's budget right 800 million bucks from the government they get to then turn that money around for their

(43:32) propaganda machine and media for their political machine in the Democratic party for their academia you know

(43:38) relationships they're in the school system they're doing all of their propaganda in the school system that's all because they're being taxfunded so

(43:45) right now there's an opportunity really of a lifetime because we technically had the Republicans right have power over

(43:50) the House enough power in the Senate and they have the White House that they could defund Planned Parenthood right

(43:56) now and so one of the big big things that we're calling for is get the job done defund and try to get all the

(44:01) people who are politically engaged who you know would say "I'm conservative or I'm Republican or I care about life to

(44:06) say let's get this thing done and defund." And there have been some defunding that's happened it's a small

(44:12) amount in the tens of millions the whole thing needs to be defunded if that were to happen that would be a huge step

(44:17) forward for the pro-life movement and I think that is within the possibility at this time politically so that's one thing we're working on yeah I just think

(44:24) there's bigger issues unfortunately that bigger issues Pearl what is a bigger issue than the killing of 3,000 babies a

(44:31) day crime taxes um what is a bigger crime than killing 3,000 babies a day

(44:36) it's women are going to do that anyway my god you're not going to take that i don't believe you'll take that away from

(44:42) them i I looked up the infant mortality rate in the 1800s and it was very similar to the abortion rate today i

(44:49) believe that women have always killed their kids i think it's a terrible thing but I I think a lot of like I don't

(44:56) really see nagging women into stopping aborting their kids as being effective i

(45:01) hope so you know but yeah so I I think maybe where you and I disagree is I

(45:06) think that people do have the power to choose to do the good including the women that you you know have such a negative view of i think people have the

(45:13) power to choose to do good and I think we need to urge them to do it we need to celebrate them when they do keep it up

(45:20) and this is for both women and men by the way and so I and I do think that by God's grace you know we've been given

(45:26) the gift of a mind to mind to think and a will to choose and I think it is important to speak the truth again and

(45:33) again especially in a culture like today where there's so many lies being told so many rationalizations for evil we got to

(45:38) speak the truth and it does convict people there are people still have consciences even if they're seared and

(45:43) and truth does have the power to convict see this is kind of the difference between men and women is women have a tendency to think that speaking into a

(45:52) microphone is going to do a lot more than I believe it does why do you speak

(45:57) men I report the news why do you do your podcast project what is your goal if you think it's it's it's meaningless i I to

(46:04) be accurate and so I think I think it's in that kind of contradict it's I think

(46:09) it's inaccurate to paint to paint women um to even say that women are ever going

(46:17) to stop killing their kids when one out of three women have done it i I just

(46:22) think that's inaccurate just to be clear Pearl it sounds like you're saying people's minds are made up they're their

(46:27) people have their evil natures they're going to do what they're going to do what's the point my question follow

(46:32) incentives people follow incentives that's my point if I can just say something here my question to you is why

(46:39) do you do what you do if you think people's minds are all made up they're just going to be the way that they are because I always felt like conservatives

(46:47) similar to you and other conservatives were inaccurate because they want to be right and they want to push their

(46:52) religion so it's very important to me that I'm accurate with what's going on

(46:58) but what's the point of being accurate if it's not going to make any difference to your point what's the point of being

(47:03) accurate yeah you're saying "Oh I'm doing this be to be accurate even though it's not going to make any difference

(47:09) cuz people's minds are made up and they're also evil." So I'm just trying to understand you didn't say that they now you did this woman put words in my

(47:15) mouth i didn't say they're evil well you said you indicated that people have always killed you know their babies

(47:22) people have these bad natures you know I think you're referring to people tend to do what's best for themselves and if

(47:28) it's in a woman's best interest to kill the kid she she's going to do it most likely and and me moralizing and saying

(47:35) "Oh like it's really easy like for me to come on here and say "Oh this is so wrong." Like then you look good right

(47:42) you get the virtue signal it's great but it doesn't change the fact that women are going to do it in my opinion yeah so

(47:49) I mean I hear what you're saying but I I think you're wrong i think definitely people do change their mind they do

(47:54) choose not to have abortions all the time and I think we making it illegal making abortion illegal also helps a lot

(47:59) with getting women to not have abortions that has been proven based on the increase in live births in the years

(48:05) after abortion laws have gone into effect um this argument that people are always going to sin so therefore we

(48:11) should just legally permit the sin and give up the project that's not the that's the law i

(48:17) said I'm not a lawmaker like I'm not my point is I

(48:22) can't I can't change the laws this isn't make a wish right this isn't If I could

(48:28) I would but I can't okay so sure i mean I I I understand

(48:34) you're not a lawmaker but I I I don't know that has how that's relevant to what I was just saying i mean you're you're it sounds like your position is

(48:40) you're you're kind of saying give up the pro-life fight it's not worth it that's not what I said because people are Oh that's not what you said i said you guys

(48:46) are ineffective and I don't think you're winning yeah i don't think you're winning yeah do then how does the PLC

(48:52) movement become more effective how How should we win tell me how to win Pearl i'm curious i wish I could i think it's a losing cause because women want to

(48:59) kill their kids that's We're talking in circles a little here because it sounds like you're saying "Well it's a losing

(49:04) cause because women are always just going to want to kill your kids." Is that your position yeah you guys are not going to win this one and my and and

(49:11) what I'm saying in response to that the argument that well they're always going to do the bad thing so why try right

(49:17) that argument they're always going to do the sin they're always going to do the bad thing so why even try to persuade them otherwise i don't really care if

(49:23) you try like it's not or to establish laws otherwise i think that's a faulty position to take because I think people

(49:29) laws do matter and I think that people can be persuaded not all but some and I

(49:34) do think what you said earlier was good i thought I liked what you said about well I believe in accuracy you seem to

(49:39) be talking about the importance of truth i think that's what you were getting at i think the truth matters and the truth

(49:45) can convict people it can move people not everyone but many people and I think it's important to not just work for

(49:51) legal change but to continue to speak the truth in as many different ways as possible to in as many different people's as people as possible because I

(49:58) do think it it makes a difference not with everybody but with some yeah but it's going to be a small minority

(50:05) you can I mean it will depend on the person but well depends on what you mean by that we

(50:11) can agree that if a third of women are having abortions it's really not going like they're not going to stop anytime

(50:17) soon significantly right one other one other morality right like we're not going to

(50:23) drop it from a third to 10% in the next 5 years let's say of a women having

(50:28) abortions well if we if we if we get the funding away from Planned Parenthood

(50:34) they will close a lot of their facilities and if we get the abortion pill if not off the market at least put

(50:39) regulations back on which is a bare minimum thing i mean you don't you shouldn't be regulating an evil pill

(50:45) that kills babies it should be taken off the market but at minimum if this administration claims to be Republican

(50:51) even or you know in support of Maha they say they're all about making Americans healthy again that sounds like a lotable

(50:57) goal well why are you allowing the abortion pill which which is lethal which kills babies which lands one out

(51:03) of every 20 you know four women in the emergency room why are you allowing this on the market so there are things that

(51:09) could be done politically right now that would be very consequential in saving

(51:15) lives they could be but I wouldn't predict it cuz women vote so I don't think I don't think the incentive this

(51:20) isn't about voting cuz these people are already in power Pearl and and some women actually help them but let me get

(51:25) reelected go ahead um one other quick thing too is you know the 14th amendment matters here we actually already have a

(51:32) law in our constitution you know the governing legal body for our entire you know American project the 14th amendment

(51:38) says "Nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to

(51:45) any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." So already our constitution under the 14th

(51:52) amendment says that every person should be given equal protection under the law that means that those homicide laws

(51:58) those murder laws that already exist in our country should apply to babies because they are just as human as you

(52:04) are to me so I think we need to continue to make these cases it will influence people as well as we continue to

(52:10) legislate and yeah it this is not an easy fight i'm not going to sit here and be polyiana and say "Oh it's so easy no

(52:15) big deal it's going to work out everything's fine." This is a huge fight we're undertaking and it it's not resourced enough it needs to be more

(52:21) resourced but there is progress that is definitively being made and we are on the cusp of potentially substantial more

(52:28) progress and I think right now is the time to lean in and keep fighting not to back down and say "Oh I give up everybody's you know everyone it's all

(52:34) lost everyone's sensible i believe in radical acceptance so I believe in accepting the

(52:41) things that I can and cannot control so there's some things I just can't control

(52:47) why do you keep talking about women then and I believe that women can't impact them i believe you go

(52:55) on these monologues and you interrupt a lot you know I'm just letting you know um the I believe

(53:03) that women killing their kids is out of my control because they've always done it i hope you guys make some progress i

(53:11) wouldn't predict it that's my opinion well I appreciate your hope Pearl yeah

(53:16) so appreciate that i want to talk about I think it I think Well I'll just say one quick last thing i think that it's

(53:22) important that we don't um I would say that saying "Well it's always it's

(53:28) always been this way it's always going to be that way i would say if that's our posture then yeah it might never change

(53:33) but throughout human history when there have been huge changes when there have been huge injustices that have been

(53:39) rectified or overcome it's because people stood up and woke up and said "I'm going to do something about this." And that's the spirit that drives our

(53:45) movement and and that's what's going to continue to uh win make wins that we've had and and get to more wins yeah I

(53:52) think that sounds nice um but I don't think it's the most pragmatic so I wanted to move on to the next

(53:59) um would you agree that women are

(54:06) not actually let me say this in a different way you stop but um that's horrible if

(54:13) true I mean it's all very horrible okay I don't necessarily think women are as nurturing as conservatives make us out

(54:21) to be and I think women are far more violent than conservatives really

(54:27) um talk about and the reason I think that is because of the abuse towards

(54:32) children and their inclination towards killing their kids would you disagree with that

(54:38) i So you're saying you think conservatives think women are more nurturing than they are yeah i think

(54:43) that women are nature I think men are the nurturing gender but go ahead okay i

(54:49) mean it's an interesting theory i think that men can absolutely be very nurturing i do think that there's sometimes a stereotype about men like

(54:55) they're not nurturing and I don't think that's true um I think women are designed to be nurturing and it's a very

(55:01) defective society that produces unnurturing women and that's a very that's a big tragedy it's really sad and

(55:08) I agree with you that American society because of abortion quite frankly and

(55:13) the sexual revolution has created a generation of people that struggle to be

(55:19) their their natural design maybe even more than former generations because we we objectify each other so much with

(55:25) pornography because of the sexual revolution because abortion and contraception is just right there it's like okay of course I'm going to have

(55:31) sex outside of marriage no big deal okay abortion is the backup contraception so yeah I I agree with you in as far as as

(55:38) far as the 100,000 foot view of yeah society today there's a lot of uh defectiveness in uh the kinds of ways

(55:45) that we're shaping how we're shaping people so what makes you blame society and not women so because I I hear this a

(55:53) lot i'm going to I'm going to make my case and then you can go so I hear this a lot from conservatives that it's

(56:00) always the default whenever there's a negative trait about women they always tend to blame society so if women are

(56:06) choosing because we have the choice to do anything now so if we're not choosing to be mothers and we're choosing to be

(56:11) violent towards our children maybe that's just by and large how women are

(56:17) why is it that society is pressuring women to do it or society is um pro I

(56:22) heard you say propaganda earlier i just when I was selfish they just wanted to

(56:28) do other things rather than be a mom one wanted to be a nurse and one was just crazy irresponsible um I don't think it

(56:36) was propaganda when I see in the real world i don't think they were coerced i think they were just selfish people um

(56:43) so what makes you blame society and not the woman so I I don't know that it's

(56:49) such a binary of oh you only blame society and you don't blame the woman i think of course people are responsible

(56:54) for their actions 100% and you know I would say it's similar to saying okay the society is so pornified right

(57:00) there's porn everywhere the average age of exposure to porn is like seven or eight years years old right there's a

(57:06) ton of men who are addicted to pornography i would say that that is in part a problem with our society right so

(57:14) you can say well isn't it the men's fault they're addicted to pornography well it's also society's fault because we're so pornified and they're growing

(57:20) up in a culture that's so dark and that it you know has pornography can we say corn can we say a moment away on the

(57:28) internet can we say corn just for the the YouTube i'm sorry sure corn yeah but but do you see what I'm saying so I

(57:33) don't think this is like you know giving special women a pass or giving men a pass i my argument would be our society

(57:40) is really broken right now people still have responsibility for their actions but we're making it easier for people to

(57:46) commit vice by having pornography or sorry pornography however you say it on

(57:52) you know to for YouTube regulations whatever but I think that makes it easier for people to commit sin who

(57:58) voted for these things you're saying who voted for for um uh

(58:04) the sexual revolution and hookup culture what exactly are you i mean well you could look at the

(58:11) history of the sexual revolution so there's Hugh Hefner there's Larry Later there's a number of you know these you

(58:18) know Alfred Kinsey is a huge one i don't know if you're familiar are you familiar with Alfred Hefner for women wanting to

(58:24) be [ __ ] laya come on well I don't know that I think we're maybe talking past each other now but

(58:31) you're asking me about how did we get to the I think you were asking me it's a little unclear sometimes what you're trying to ask but I think you were

(58:37) asking me how did we get to this point where we have all this sexualization in our culture because who voted for it i

(58:42) think that was your question i'm saying who voted for who wants sex ed in school who wants abortion who wants hookup

(58:50) culture who voted for this stuff

(58:55) well I don't know that people are voting for sexed in school that's not like an up- down vote so the way it works if

(59:01) just to look back in the history of the sexual revolution you had you know what I'm asking voting Democrat men or women

(59:10) okay I mean both vote Democrat but you're are you saying that more women are voting Democrat than men is that in

(59:15) the last 100 years if only men voted it would be 100% conservative

(59:21) a guy so the women women are opening up their legs to men so I would say that

(59:28) women are responsible for this it sounds like you're kind of taking a posture here because you're kind of acting like

(59:34) oh you know you must think women don't hold any responsibility for their actions and I don't think that I've I

(59:40) haven't said that so it sounds like we're maybe talking past each other here a little bit I don't know how productive that is but I would say if we're going

(59:46) to talk about you know how did we get to where we are today if that's the the discussion here like how did we get to where we are so maybe we can discover

(59:52) how do we solve the problems of the day right you can look at it through a lens of oh it's all you know this particular

(59:58) block of women who were voting left every day all day long right you could say you could make an argument like that

(1:00:04) i would want to go back and look even further and say okay what are the um ideologies right that are driving

(1:00:10) people's yeah voting decisions is part of it but most importantly actually it's their behaviors because the sexual

(1:00:15) revolution wasn't the consequence of voting the sexual revolution was a consequence of people saying "Aha we're

(1:00:21) liberated." I just notic whenever I say something's like women whenever I say something's women's fault you'll always

(1:00:27) find a way to like divert and blame it on either society or or basically a man

(1:00:32) so that's not accurate Pearl i don't know where you're getting that okay well they watch it the broad sweeping I'm

(1:00:38) what I would say is the broad sweeping generalizations that you you know seem to be making are not particularly useful

(1:00:44) in actually diagnosing the problem of where where we're at today and how we got here if you you know I can I was kind of trying to speak to uh the sexual

(1:00:51) revolution and how we got here ideologically and also technologically because the advent of the birth control

(1:00:56) pill I think was also a big um impetus quite frankly for the sexual revolution

(1:01:02) and so now we think oh sex can be separated from procreation right that's no problem just have sex it's not a big

(1:01:09) deal well sex is a big deal it can create new life abortions being used as backup contraception right so I think

(1:01:16) part of The issue is you know the public funding of abortion and contraception via Planned Parenthood is a huge issue

(1:01:23) that we can fight on a public policy level and then on an education level you know undoing all the nonsense that's

(1:01:29) being taught about sex and about you know human identity i think that's a a big project is everybody going to listen

(1:01:36) is everybody going to just do what's right once they learn the truth not no i'm not saying everyone's just going to listen but I think it's important to

(1:01:42) still speak the truth and and work to educate people both men and women you know everybody needs that so okay so I

(1:01:49) wanted to move on to the next topic so I hear you talk a lot about marriage so I would love for you to sell me marriage

(1:01:56) what benefit does marriage have for men yeah well I would start by saying marriage is not for everyone so I I

(1:02:03) don't want to come in here and be like "Everybody has to get married because it's not for everyone." I believe marriage is a calling it's very

(1:02:09) beautiful i believe it's for maybe many people even most people but you know I think some people might have a different

(1:02:14) calling so I want to start with that um I think that also if if somebody is you

(1:02:21) know look maybe because of divorce in the ba in their past meaning uh they

(1:02:26) they were a child of divorce or you know seeing abuse in their household with their mother their mother was abusive or

(1:02:32) their father was abusive there was neglect whatever it was they might have a lot of wounds right that makes it

(1:02:39) difficult for them to imagine a happy life with a family a happy marriage happy children and so I think there's a

(1:02:45) lot of people like that today and I would say we need to work on discovering

(1:02:50) healing finding healing uh because people aren't going to want to get married if they think marriage is

(1:02:56) miserable or they think that marriage is just going to end in divorce or you know unhappy with each other so what does he

(1:03:02) get what does he what what's in it for him for just any man what would be in 28

(1:03:09) Ivy League let's say he's 28 years old he's an Ivy League graduate at a law school i have a friend 28 Ivy League

(1:03:16) grad he's going places in life what is in it for him to get married what does

(1:03:21) he do i mean it's not just to just to be clear if this is where you're going with this I wouldn't be like oh 28-year-old

(1:03:27) man in Ivy League in in Harvard if I was like talking to him right now I'd be like you have to get married i don't

(1:03:32) know that he should get married he might not be his calling many of them uh I think will get married it's a beautiful

(1:03:38) thing a good thing so where are you going with this are you trying to say men should Is your your position that

(1:03:43) men should never get married and I guess women then no one should get married to each other period uh I don't tell people

(1:03:49) I don't tell people what to do i certainly don't Why are you asking so So you don't have a position on this you're

(1:03:55) saying I I say do what you want but I hear

(1:04:01) conservatives I hear conservatives sell marriage i believe I've seen tweets from you that are pushing like marriage and

(1:04:08) getting married so I'm asking you if you're going to sell it and push that what is in it for the man what does he

(1:04:14) get if he says "Layla I want to what do I get out of a Catholic marriage or out of marriage in general?" Well let's make

(1:04:21) a couple important distinctions you're saying "Oh you you push marriage in tweets." And I definitely have talked about marriage being a very beautiful

(1:04:28) thing and a very good thing which it is uh it's a sacrament I believe and it brings two people together in a

(1:04:34) beautiful relationship that is between them and God and they can bring life into the world i think that's amazing and we need strong marriages for any

(1:04:40) strong civilization so I'm going to say that proudly and you know I don't I think that's good to say but that

(1:04:46) doesn't mean everybody I'm going to go say everybody in the world has to go get married then so I'm I don't know I don't

(1:04:53) know what your push marriage I would I would say I definitely promote marriage

(1:04:58) it's a good thing and we need we need healthy and strong marriages so if it's a good thing what does but I'm not going to say everybody should get married i

(1:05:04) don't think that's correct that's totally fine but I'm asking what does he get out of it

(1:05:09) you mean what does any hypothetical man get out of any hypothetical marriage is that your question i gave you a hypothetical guy so like what does he

(1:05:16) get out of marriage well I let's say asking guy to get out

(1:05:23) of marriage i mean if he's this marriage freely for to put your hypothetical if

(1:05:30) he I want to make sure he's not like being forced into getting married because then it's like don't do it right or he's mirroring some bad you know if

(1:05:36) he's marrying somebody who is not a woman of virtue not a woman who shares his values but if you're a man and you

(1:05:41) desire marriage and you're working on bettering yourself I would encourage you look for a virtuous woman look for one

(1:05:46) that shares your values look for somebody that you can see her family background you can see her history and

(1:05:52) she's trying to live a good life she's trying to live a life of virtue she's trying to you know she she's open to

(1:05:58) life herself she wants to be a mother she's open to um you know loving any children you might create i think you

(1:06:05) know you you you obviously have attraction for each other i think those are all beautiful things and if you're a man considering marriage you should

(1:06:11) weigh those things and then if you were to find a woman like that get married I mean women according to the men women

(1:06:17) men and women according to the social data who get married are happier and men who get married are wealthier because

(1:06:24) they have a family project they're now working towards so in that sense marriage can be a very beautiful thing and a beautiful choice for some men

(1:06:32) right but I still have not hearing what he gets in return so he can make more money that his statistically you said

(1:06:40) get married do better financially you said he can make more are you aware of that yeah you said he can make more money that his family can spend so he

(1:06:47) gets to pay for more people so well I didn't say that exactly but that is true

(1:06:52) his family would be spending his money that's true but I just um I purpose in that right i I want to actually I think

(1:06:58) I maybe I probably said it but are you aware of the social data about men and and and marriage and how men who get

(1:07:06) married they do do better typically not all but overall economically and there's

(1:07:12) a reason for that they have a driving purpose in their life where they're working for the sake of their family and

(1:07:18) also women who get married similarly women who get married similarly uh are

(1:07:23) more happier and satisfied according to social surveys so both men and women experience these advantages when they

(1:07:29) get married in general i'm not saying it's for everybody but in general yeah i mean they can they can make a survey

(1:07:34) that says that but when half of women are fat and a quarter of marriages are sexless that's not really you know what

(1:07:41) we're seeing and and the average marriage is eight years you could you could like put a survey in front of me

(1:07:48) but when every other person's getting divorced even in conser even so-called conservative women

(1:07:56) um you could say that it doesn't mean it's true right i personally I think it's a bad deal i I think it's an

(1:08:03) unfavorable deal to men would you get married Pearl just curious you don't have to answer if you don't want i don't

(1:08:08) understand what my personal situation has to do with it i may I may not but my

(1:08:15) my question is for men it's it's simply an unfavorable deal in my opinion and I

(1:08:21) just would love to hear if conservatives are going to say it's this beautiful awesome thing well it would be good to

(1:08:28) answer the question what do men get out of it well the the the biggest thing

(1:08:33) that men would get and women get this exact same thing when they're entering marriage with God as a sacrament uh the

(1:08:40) whole point of marriage is sanctification a journey to heaven and so the ultimate you know prize of

(1:08:46) marriage would be heaven and I'm not saying that you know you can't go to heaven without marriage of course you

(1:08:52) can go to heaven without marriage but it's a it's a sanctification it's a it's a family a school of love for you to

(1:08:58) grow in virtue and grow in love of God and each other right you said but you said they can get

(1:09:04) heaven without it too yeah if you're called that way not every as I said before not everyone's called to get

(1:09:10) married okay so but some are many are anything else they get out of it

(1:09:18) well I mean heaven's pretty great uh uh being married to your best friend I think that's a beautiful thing children

(1:09:24) are absolutely a beautiful gift um children I would say now they don't they

(1:09:30) don't need marriage to get that anymore yeah just to finish I think children are the the crown of a marriage they're the

(1:09:36) most beautiful gift of a marriage is a child and yes you can have children outside of marriage but I would not recommend it i don't think that's good

(1:09:42) for you or the children well what's the difference well I think I mean I don't know your

(1:09:49) personal experience but I think if you just live with someone and you stay together forever what's the difference

(1:09:54) well I think that marriage is this public declaration before not just other

(1:10:00) people but to God and it's a covenant where you're promising you know for life

(1:10:06) to love this person even in sac even even with sacrifices exclusively

(1:10:11) faithfully to be open to life i think that's a a beautiful thing i mean I don't think cohabitation yeah but God

(1:10:19) doesn't stop these women from divorces i I there was someone in the even the Catholic I can't remember their name but

(1:10:26) even recently in the Catholic community there were like one of the worst divorces I ever saw was from Michael Nolles's church that he went to in

(1:10:32) California like the one of the worst most brutal so God's not God's not stopping these women

(1:10:39) that want to leave so how is it like I don't just don't see the difference

(1:10:45) sure i mean I think maybe we're talking past each other a little bit but some of the so look we can talk about social data for a minute right so social data

(1:10:53) um shows this is a survey that looked at the happiness of men you know their personal happiness right and 43% of men

(1:11:01) who say that they're very happy with life are and this is men in their 20s and 30s were married so the majority of

(1:11:07) the men who were very happy um or the largest a single amount I should say of the men who were said they were very

(1:11:13) happy with life or were married so I think marriage absolutely can be a source of great happiness for people not

(1:11:19) all people again I'm not saying there aren't bad marriages i'm not saying that divorce isn't a major problem those are

(1:11:24) all true things but I think we sometimes kick marriage like a dog in today's culture like oh marriage is so bad and

(1:11:30) you know marriage is worthless marriage is useless i think that's totally untrue and marriage is marriage is beautiful

(1:11:36) and and it's a good thing ultimately yeah um I would disagree because I think it gives the women leverage and that's

(1:11:42) why women really like it is because now they have legal power over the husband so I think it can really change the

(1:11:48) dynamic almost negatively in favor of the woman so I actually It's an interesting

(1:11:54) perspective but I don't think you can really I think it's a good thing yeah i don't really um And and you said virtue

(1:12:02) how can we tell if a woman's virtuous right um her actions wouldn't you agree

(1:12:07) it's her actions not her words her actions definitely i think that's a great point Pearl i think you you can

(1:12:13) best know what someone's going to do not by what they say necessarily but how they behaved um how they behave and

(1:12:20) their actions actions do speak louder than words words matter too but actions speak louder than words i think that's a

(1:12:25) very wise observation that you're making right so if 95% of women aren't virgins

(1:12:30) on their wedding days like how can the guy really see that she's virtuous

(1:12:36) well I would say in in today's culture unfortunately you know you were kind of speaking maybe alluding to this earlier

(1:12:42) there are a lot of sex there's a lot of sexual promiscuity so virginity is rare today that is a fact um I think it's

(1:12:50) kind of making a comeback in some ways people are saying "Hey it's normal actually to not have sex before marriage." And that's a good thing you

(1:12:57) know people I remember you know when I was uh I remember being made fun of for being a virgin and unfortunately some

(1:13:02) virgins are made fun of for that right and that's a really gross thing that our culture might do or people might do but

(1:13:09) I think that I do think chastity and pure love and at least in some circles is making a comeback i think that's a

(1:13:14) beautiful thing and I also think people can choose to recommmit themselves to a life of uh chastity even if they've

(1:13:21) lived a very rough past and I think that that happens that's also very beautiful and good right but there's nothing like

(1:13:27) what's in it for the guy to do that when 70 to 80% of divorces are fi filed by women 90% of alimony payments are men to

(1:13:36) women the majority of child support payments are men to women the average marriage is eight years you know on

(1:13:44) average he gets a 28 27year-old nonvirgin woman with x amount of sexual

(1:13:51) partners what does he get for taking on this astronomical risk like you know if he has two kids with a woman she

(1:13:58) garnishes 40% of his income for 18 years and you don't believe in prenups you

(1:14:03) don't even think I' I've seen your tweet on that you don't even think he can mitigate against that so if if that's

(1:14:11) the case you know what does he get well again I mean I I did mention some

(1:14:17) of the social data that women men who are h men who are married report that they're happier than men who are not men

(1:14:22) who are married actually are more You're attributing you're attributing the happiness you can just let me finish

(1:14:28) you're attributing the happiness to the women so like they're happy people women like happy men sorry go ahead go ahead

(1:14:35) okay thank you um yeah so there's a lot of social data that shows that men who are married are happier they're more

(1:14:40) happy with their sex lives they're more happy overall you know report higher levels of satisfaction also that they

(1:14:46) you know make more money again I'm not saying that's directly because of the marriage per se but I'm saying that's

(1:14:52) important social data to look at because I do think there's some fear-mongering today about marriage being so bad you

(1:15:00) know you're just going to get divorced it's miserable everybody's out to get you it's going to be terrible right and

(1:15:05) I think that we shouldn't live by fear or make decisions based off of fear we should yes look at the data look at the

(1:15:11) information but when we're considering marriage if that's a desire that somebody has instead of looking at the

(1:15:17) broad brush of oh there's a lot of failed marriages out there there's a lot of bad you know people doing bad things

(1:15:22) out there instead look at okay what do what would I want in a marriage what kind of marriage would I want in terms of um a spouse right

(1:15:30) and and and I think they should look for people that share their values share their you know have virtues and that is

(1:15:37) going to be the most secure kind of partnership to build as opposed to somebody that is not aligned with them

(1:15:43) with their values with that kind of core foundation of what even marriage is virtue things like that right but men

(1:15:49) it's not really fear-mongering when men are nine times more likely to commit suicide after divorce I I've interviewed

(1:15:56) men who've had their kids transitioned the and this is not uncommon it's not

(1:16:02) just a fringe case this happens all the time with women that are I mean we saw what happened to Steven Crowder he

(1:16:07) married a virgin religious woman and she painted him painted him as an abuser so

(1:16:15) you keep like diverting from the question i'm just saying if he's going to take on this astronomical risk which

(1:16:20) could lead to indentured servitude which 18 years 40% of your income that's a ton

(1:16:25) of money a ton and and not to mention reputa i' I've interviewed men where the

(1:16:31) women actually called all of his business friends and ruined his business i' I've talked to men thrown in jail

(1:16:38) i've talked to men that had their kids transition this is a huge risk Laya it's not really fear-mongering when these are

(1:16:44) real cases and it's not uncommon so I don't think it's I think on I don't think it's wrong of me to say that this

(1:16:52) could happen and ask the question what does the guy get out of this what is his

(1:16:58) reward well a few things first of all I think marriage the greater the risk uh the

(1:17:04) greater the reward right marriage is self- gift marriage is an all-in and it's becoming one flesh with someone

(1:17:10) else that is a huge risk it's for richer or for poorer it's for better or for wor it's in sickness and in health and

(1:17:15) that's that does expose someone but there's also this incredible potential for beauty right as I was talking about

(1:17:21) earlier it's this covenant it's a sacrament you can bring life into the world you can raise a family together

(1:17:26) this is the person that can be your your best friend your most your most faithful companion and I see marriages like this

(1:17:32) all the time those marriages exist and I don't think they get enough air time we don't talk about how good and beautiful

(1:17:37) marriage is designed to be and can be so I agree with you that there is chaos out there that there are a lot of broken

(1:17:43) marriages that there's a lot of suffering but I don't think that should hold people back to say "Well then it's impossible for me i can never have a

(1:17:50) beautiful or good marriage." So why don't you think women want to get married today

(1:17:56) i think there's a lot of women who want to get married today well then why don't I You're talking about all women who are

(1:18:01) you talking about when you say women you like to say women a lot do you are you speaking about who are you exactly

(1:18:08) speaking about cuz it it seems like it would be I think a much too much of an overgeneralization to say all women so

(1:18:14) what do you mean by women most women don't want to get married when they have the most choice to the average age of marriage is around 30 so when women have

(1:18:23) the most your argument is that most women don't want to get married is your position yeah if women wanted to how do

(1:18:28) I see what people want to do Laya well based on what they I'm just trying to track your argument here uh Pearl so

(1:18:35) you're saying I'm asking most women So you're saying most women don't want to get married and the way you know that is

(1:18:41) because there's a lot of unmarried women that seems like a pretty Yeah that's the choice they make

(1:18:47) well I know a lot of women who are married so I don't know where you're kind of going with this there's certainly a lot of married women there's

(1:18:52) unmarried women how old are they how old are these married women i mean all different Gen Z gen Z only it's like 10

(1:18:59) 15% are married so if you know women under because I'm the youngest millennial so sure so 27 and younger you

(1:19:08) can't know a ton because statistically the majority just are not married

(1:19:14) okay i um what what you had you had a tweet

(1:19:20) um and I can't remember the exact tweet off the top of my but I just want to

(1:19:25) know why you think you said there's a reason women don't get married so what is their reason why

(1:19:33) so you're asking me why don't some women get married i think there's going to be a lot of reasons why some women don't

(1:19:38) get married um you can there's a whole bunch of hypotheticals we could create here so and we can do them for men too

(1:19:45) and some of the reasons will be the same some will be different but I think some reasons women might not get married is because they feel like it's not

(1:19:52) meaningful enough it was just so sad right they think it's not like going to be a beautiful thing it's somehow a

(1:19:58) burden that having children is a burden unfortunately a lot of women today not

(1:20:03) all but there's definitely women today that see children as a burden and that's

(1:20:08) you know one of my you know projects of trying to speak to the beauty of children the beauty of marriage men are

(1:20:15) not threats men are not your competitors men are uh are are good they're good and

(1:20:21) they are designed for being in partnership with women that's a good thing so you know

(1:20:29) what's up like partner partnership we're not equals

(1:20:35) i mean that may be your opinion but I think men and women have equal dignity before and as as children of God so I

(1:20:43) mean that maybe you don't agree with that you you would say you you have less dignity than a man or I would say I have

(1:20:50) less I would say women have less value in terms of what they bring to a marriage and society um men don't have

(1:20:58) less value uh men produce 80% of the world's stuff i think men are smarter i

(1:21:03) think they're able um women have a tendency to do things in the least effective way possible um and I don't

(1:21:10) think unequal is necessarily a bad I don't think unequal is necessarily a bad thing i think there's hierarchy in the

(1:21:16) world right i think it goes God men women children just cuz um the kid has

(1:21:21) to listen to the mom it doesn't mean the mom is um it doesn't mean it's necessarily a

(1:21:26) bad thing it just means there's a hierarchy so just to be clear Peril do you think that women have less value

(1:21:33) than men or do women have equal value to men i would say women provide less value than men do women have the same value do

(1:21:42) they possess it by nature of being a human being like men do they have the same value as men it depends to who and

(1:21:47) what so you could say to God but I'm not speaking are they

(1:21:53) as I'm not I'm not over I'm not overly religious but when I look at the value

(1:21:59) women bring in a marriage I would say it's less than men do you believe in

(1:22:05) universal human rights um I think so but I don't necessarily

(1:22:12) know what that would entail but it sounds like something I would believe in do you think that men and women should

(1:22:19) have the same basic human rights like the right to life as an example

(1:22:24) um they should have the right to life voting not necessarily that I don't think so I don't think there should be

(1:22:31) equal rights but should is a wish list it's never going to happen so so you think that women shouldn't vote is your

(1:22:37) position i can't argue about this on I can't say the answer to that and it's not cuz I don't want to but I I got to

(1:22:44) stay YouTube friendly but I could I could I could I I can't I want to but I

(1:22:50) can't I can't I just got remonetized but wait so you're So you I

(1:22:56) can't I can't argue I can't argue that i can't I want to but I can't um but I I

(1:23:03) just want So you're saying you're afraid you'll be demonetized on YouTube for I was demonetized for that topic so it's

(1:23:09) not an afraid like that happened so um I but I still want to go back to the qu I

(1:23:15) still haven't gotten to of what men get out of marriage i I a lot of things I can keep going if you want but I'll go

(1:23:22) back to it because I think marriage again uh you can it sounds like you're you're talking about a lot of the negative things the broken things that

(1:23:29) can happen with marriage which are all I'm not going to say that's not that those things bad things don't happen they absolutely can happen and our

(1:23:35) culture is kind of a mess right now with divorce and all these other things i agree with that but marriage is beautiful marriage is about self-gift

(1:23:41) and it's about entering into a sacred covenant with another soul you know imperfect soul but another soul who's

(1:23:48) oriented towards the same end which is I believe heaven towards uh God ultimately

(1:23:53) and it's the place where children deserve to be born into you know I think that's another part of this conversation we're not maybe having enough is that

(1:23:59) kids deserve to be in a household with married parents with a married mother

(1:24:06) and a married father now that's not the case unfortunately for many children today but that is what we should strive

(1:24:11) towards that's what the that's what the kid gets out of marriage but not what the so I keep asking what the man what

(1:24:17) does he get well I you you kind of dismissed the social data I mentioned and and didn't respond to it but

(1:24:23) according to the social data men who are married report the highest levels of satisfaction and happiness and they also

(1:24:30) earn the most so that is an objective data point about how men many men not all but many men in marriage fare very

(1:24:37) well right they earn more but that doesn't necessarily mean they have more take-home well they're happy oh I don't

(1:24:45) know about the takehome I mean I think they earn more and yes they do have more takehome and they're very hap they're happy too it's not just money it's

(1:24:52) happiness wouldn't you say that women marry happy men um I mean in general like you you didn't

(1:24:59) you when you met your husband you didn't want a doomer guy you wanted a happy guy right so it's I would I would discredit

(1:25:06) that because I think women select for happy men in general so I just would

(1:25:11) love to hear like something do they get sex whenever they want that would be a good selling point is that is it can

(1:25:18) they legally get that no well I mean I think people who are married yes do have more sex according

(1:25:24) to social data and and report higher levels of sexual satisfaction yeah that is that is true okay so what do you

(1:25:32) think oh yeah promiscuous sex is not as great as it's cracked up to be having a different partner every month and all

(1:25:37) the issues that come with that you're you actually are more sexually satisfied in a marriage right if she sleeps with

(1:25:44) you but a quarter of marriages are sexless so there's not even a guarantee there like you know what I mean like if

(1:25:50) I was going to buy a product and there was a one out of four defective rate I'd be pissed

(1:25:55) yeah yeah i mean I think you're looking at marriage in a very through a very utilitarian lens instead of marriage

(1:26:01) being about this sacred covenant about self- gift and about ultimately yeah

(1:26:07) it's a spiritual thing it's not just oh what do I get out of it and what am I doing in it it's about ultimately a a a

(1:26:13) beautiful gift of yourself to another person with all the risks that come with that and the potential for new human

(1:26:18) life that you can bring into the world right but if women Yeah you so so I would I would just say actually to kind of maybe put a finer point in it for you

(1:26:25) i would say if if you're a man or a woman right and you're thinking about marriage and you're like "What am I

(1:26:30) going to get out of it what am I going to get out of it what am I going to get out of it?" And that's kind of the preoccupation then I would say "Yeah maybe you shouldn't get married."

(1:26:37) Because if you go into marriage either as a man or a woman and it's all about what am I going to get out of this then I think you're going to be you're going

(1:26:43) to be disappointed yeah i think that's easy to say when you're the woman and you accumulate pretty much no risk in

(1:26:49) marriage i think that's easy to say when you are the benefit well isn't that your point isn't part of your point though

(1:26:54) that men should It sounds like your point is that men shouldn't get married because they don't get enough out of it right i would say it's an unfavorable I

(1:27:00) would say it's a bad deal and that if conservatives want like if you want the babies that you you know you say you

(1:27:06) want like you know more people having kids they're a gift yada yada well then

(1:27:11) maybe conservatives should try to have a better answer for this question yeah well again I I I'm giving you know I'm

(1:27:19) I'm speaking towards the fact that social data says that 43% of men who are

(1:27:24) married say they're very happy versus only 21% of cohabitating men and only 20% of single men so married men are

(1:27:31) objectively according to the social data reporting higher levels of of high happiness like I'm very happy than

(1:27:38) single men or cohabitating men so that's a data point that measure is important how do it's through surveying it's

(1:27:45) through surveying act the most accurate way to measure happiness of emotion that

(1:27:50) changes every single day well you ask people generally speaking are you would you consider yourself happy unhappy you

(1:27:56) know there's a different way that you The wife sitting there she's like are you happy he's like yes are you saying the men are not telling the truth in the

(1:28:02) survey or what's your position there my position is what a lot of people have a tendency i I think happiness studies

(1:28:09) tend to be [ __ ] and it's you usually used by people that have an agenda to push that that's my opinion on happiness

(1:28:16) surveys in general sure well you can you can have your opinions about surveys

(1:28:21) that's fine but I I think the I think the surveys are very illuminating and I also think that the data about wealth is

(1:28:28) very interesting that married men according to the data are wealthier than

(1:28:33) unmarried men and even if they get divorced they're still wealthier than they would have been than the unmarried

(1:28:39) uh undiv so I think that's another important data point where is that data from where is that from i don't know if

(1:28:46) you're familiar with Brad Wilcox but he does he sells marriage i know his stuff

(1:28:51) what's that yeah yeah he He's You don't like him no it's it's who funds his stuff so Oh who funds it okay but you're

(1:28:58) saying people when it's a relig Well it's when people are selling their religion right they have a tendency to I

(1:29:04) don't think he's selling religion Pearl i think he's just reporting data about the financial status of men but you know

(1:29:10) here's here's the thing Laya when men don't want happiness they want peace

(1:29:17) so I think that's that's the thing you're equating what women want out of marriage instead of what men want out of

(1:29:22) marriage um the second thing I don't think that's true at all i mean I don't I don't even think I've used the word um

(1:29:29) I don't I I don't think you're right uh I don't think you're thinking my

(1:29:34) position at all you don't think men want peace correctly no I I think of course men men I I Who wouldn't want peace i

(1:29:40) agree that I'm sure men want many men want peace and I a lot of women want peace but I don't I don't think that's a

(1:29:47) the characterization that I'm just talking about women marriage from a women's lens i don't think that's

(1:29:53) accurate i'm talking about social data i'm talking about men reporting self-reporting that they're happier no

(1:30:00) that study that study over 40% of men who are married so you don't believe you think the men are not telling the truth

(1:30:06) i think that men want peace women want happiness so when you're saying that men get happiness out of out of a marriage

(1:30:12) I'm saying well they want peace so I'm saying you're equating women want happiness men want peace sure yeah i

(1:30:20) mean I just don't think your position that you know men should never get married and marriage is all bad is

(1:30:25) correct i think that's completely incorrect i think the social data proves otherwise i think there's a tremendous

(1:30:31) amount of uh you know happily married couples that would prove otherwise so I I don't I I think we should stop i think

(1:30:38) we should uh look at the data of course but also just look at the human design i think we were designed for love i think

(1:30:44) we were made for love and love comes with risk of course it does loving any

(1:30:49) other person you know that person not only could they do something bad they could die they could get sick they could

(1:30:55) you know they could have certainly messed up so love comes with risk but we are made for love to love and to be

(1:31:01) loved and marriage I do believe there's graces that you get in marriage talking about this from the perspective of

(1:31:07) someone who enters marriage with the lens of self-gift i'm doing this because I love this person i want to get to

(1:31:12) heaven i want to serve God and other people i believe there's real graces that God gives us and you know I I I I

(1:31:20) uh see this in my personal life you know beautifully i know that's a personal example but you know God does give

(1:31:25) people grace to live out their vocations and I believe if someone is called to marriage and they become the best they

(1:31:31) can be they meet someone they have a beautiful relationship dating relationship they really get to know them they think this is a good person

(1:31:36) that I want to build a life project with i think that can be an incredibly beautiful and good thing then they can

(1:31:41) bring children into the world that's how civilization will even stand you know that's why we can even have any kind of

(1:31:47) a healthy civilization if we have healthy marriages and families we should celebrate that and and support that

(1:31:52) right i just don't think it's realistic i don't think it's common and and I would say it's been a little

(1:31:57) disheartening because I was a consumer of a lot of conservative content right the last decade you know before I was

(1:32:03) even a YouTuber and a lot of people with the same talking points you have ended up getting divorced

(1:32:10) so it's like even the people pushing this stuff can't keep it together i hope I hope I hope people are married

(1:32:17) i know i mean yes there's a lot of divorce i agree that's a really bad thing like I debated we're in agreement there's a lot of people who are who are

(1:32:23) married still and it's very very beautiful and you know I think I think you know it does seem like you have made

(1:32:30) up your mind Pearl and you know at least at this stage and I don't know all the personal reasons for that or the reasons

(1:32:36) for that beyond what you've maybe shared on this in this conversation but you know objectively speaking according to

(1:32:42) data and according to both financial data and survey data there's a ton of married men who are very happy and doing

(1:32:47) well and also marriage is a sacrament I believe it's covenant It's designed for

(1:32:52) more than what I what I get out of it but it it's designed for what I actually tell you what gave me I could

(1:32:59) tell you what gave me this opinion uh it's fake it's fake tradcons

(1:33:06) that No and I'm going to I'm going to Do you want to know what I Do you want to know what that is do you know what that is tell me yeah tell me tell me why you

(1:33:13) So it sounds if I'm if I I don't want to mischaracterize your position but it sounds like you're saying marriage is bad it's not worth it no man should get

(1:33:20) married is that your position or am I misreading you my position is a it's a bad deal for men so so would you say

(1:33:27) then would it be then therefore men should not get married would be your Do you think it's in your place to tell Do

(1:33:33) you think it's your place as a woman to tell men what to do well I I I'm not again I'm not going to

(1:33:40) go tell any specific man you should get married or you should not because I don't know what he should do i can say generally speaking marriage is good for

(1:33:46) a lot of people and it's a beautiful gift and we need more healthy marriages do you do you think you're kind of

(1:33:52) moving the goal post a little bit do you think it's your place as a woman to tell men what to do

(1:33:58) i mean if if you're Let's kind of break that down are you saying uh I can't as a

(1:34:04) woman say you know we should have homicide laws that stop men and women from killing people then yeah in that

(1:34:10) sense I guess I'm telling men what to do because I think we should have those laws so in their house I think it depends what you mean by your Okay do

(1:34:16) you think it's in your place to tell men what to do in their house do you think

(1:34:21) that's your place as a woman i mean I would not go around and I do not go tell

(1:34:27) individual men what to do in their houses no unless they're like you know coercing doing bad you know coercing bad

(1:34:34) activities or something and then I'm I'm you know educating about the bad activities saying it's bad so I I don't

(1:34:40) know where you're going with this coercing coercive activities you're going to tell them it's bad

(1:34:47) well I'm going to continue i mean you've probably seen my content Pearl i'm going to continue to educate people about and

(1:34:53) work on uh exposing things that I think are truly bad in our culture abortion

(1:34:59) being the worst and helping people see how horrific it is and and reject it and

(1:35:04) that includes to men as well as to women so I'm not going to be like well I can't tell men that these behaviors are bad

(1:35:10) because I'm a woman i think that would be a um a mistake yeah so what kind of

(1:35:15) behaviors are you telling men are bad well again I think it's it's more like

(1:35:21) for example when it comes to uh sexual ethics i've been pretty open with my

(1:35:26) content about the harm of pornography and the harm of promiscuity and I think

(1:35:31) that's a message not just for men that's a message for women too so but you you

(1:35:37) will now you you will tell men what to do when it comes to sexual promiscu i saw you do it with Justin Waller so

(1:35:44) you're going to tell men what they should do when it comes to porn and sexual promiscuity

(1:35:51) yes i'm going to say don't do not look at porn i'm going to say do not be sexually promiscuous and it's for your

(1:35:57) good and that's why I think you're a feminist because I I think that any woman that nags men and tells men what

(1:36:03) to do is a feminist and so I I would say that I'm against fake traffic you are

(1:36:09) always entitled to your opinions including on your channel girl yeah totally um so when I when I say a fake

(1:36:16) tradon this is what I say they use Jesus and religion to make money um they use

(1:36:22) their kids and their hus and some of these apply to you I would say but some don't so don't take all of them as they

(1:36:28) use their kids and their husband as a way to get clout um so you'll often see the women posting their kids on Twitter

(1:36:34) there's pedophiles on Twitter i don't know why the hell they're doing that so they'll say they'll try to sell me

(1:36:40) marriage right but you're putting your kid on an app for clout that has weird

(1:36:46) people on it and you want to say you're in a traditional marriage that that makes me

(1:36:52) think women even the conservatives ones aren't taking it too seriously you know and they're using their husband for

(1:36:58) clout um I'd say undercover feminists tell men what to do and how to run their

(1:37:04) household so I think nagging men and their behavior I just think it's out of place who are you to do that um you're a

(1:37:12) woman i think it's out of order um four using shame guilt insult and need to be

(1:37:17) right in an attempt to nag men into changing their behavior um they also tend to use this to shame the male sex

(1:37:23) drive so for example that you guys will say that pornography is like the worst thing ever but you never criticize women

(1:37:30) for delaying marriage um really the corn problem would be solved if most women

(1:37:35) married their high school boyfriends but we choose not to delete that false statement i'll I'll keep going you can

(1:37:41) respond but I want to get through all of them so they use shame guilt you could take notes and then you can go through

(1:37:46) them one by one i'll give you like two minutes so they use shame guilt insult and the need to be Oh I read that one if

(1:37:53) a woman does something sexually immoral it's always the man's fault so what they what you guys tend to do is um for

(1:38:01) example you'll say that the women were coerced um you'll give get out of jail free cards to the women that you know

(1:38:08) did cam work for Tate but Tate is the villain for making money off of it just an example um the fake conservative

(1:38:16) women they they tend to claim to be pure so what they do is they have a tendency to say that they were virgins on their

(1:38:22) wedding day or didn't make liberal decisions but when I look at their choices the purities it's always

(1:38:28) unverifiable i can't verify it it's always I have to believe them um they generally marry after 25 um they use the

(1:38:36) relationship for clout and generally the sex like women on average lose their virginity at 16 so I just have to

(1:38:42) blindly believe that in a decade you did nothing it might work on your you guys' not you but you guys' simp husbands it

(1:38:49) doesn't work on me um fake TRDCON women um tend to call themselves virgins but

(1:38:55) they have workarounds like back door [ __ ] fingering etc fake TradCon

(1:39:00) women have a tendency to platform sex workers or former hose even without verifying their story is correct i saw

(1:39:07) you do this with Nala um you know she was even when she came on your show she still had pretty provocative pictures on

(1:39:14) her Instagram net wasn't called out for it softball interview um fake tradons

(1:39:19) tend to care more about money um and being right than being honest they have a tendency to get caught in money

(1:39:26) laundering schemes um they tend to pay themselves exorbitant amounts of money in the name of God um tradons have a

(1:39:34) tendency Nala did this to convert when it's convenient and generally um they are not religious before they made money

(1:39:40) off of God trdcons tend to demonize male sin and downplay female sin for example

(1:39:46) a former hoe or oh I said this one church is generally the last um stop on

(1:39:51) the [ __ ] train and shroud cons make sure it's really easy for them um conservative women have a tendency to

(1:39:57) think that they do hard work when really they just talk into a microphone um they have a tendency to tell me they'll pray

(1:40:03) for me or insinuate why do you think this way and it's a shaming tactic to say I'm broken bitter etc um they have a

(1:40:12) tendency to use God as a way to be passive aggressive they talk too much they're not hot and generally nobody

(1:40:17) likes them so that's that's really what drove me away and gave me the opinions I had was I just saw women that did all of

(1:40:24) these things and um yeah I was like if this is who's selling marriage then God

(1:40:30) help the men go ahead i'll I'll give you respond as long as you want

(1:40:36) thank you Pearl well first of all I think you are living in this fantasy world that reduces human beings to say

(1:40:45) that men and women can't speak truth to each other that we can't you know this whole idea you can't speak truth because

(1:40:50) it's a man listening i think that's ridiculous um I don't think men and women need to be at constant war with

(1:40:56) each other i think your whole worldview is that men and women are at constant war with each other we need to just

(1:41:01) fight each other because we're always going to hurt each other and well yes there's sin in this world and we do hurt

(1:41:07) each other there is also virtue in this world there's also love in this world because of God's grace we can choose

(1:41:12) what is right and there are beautiful thriving marriages the social data shows us that men who are married actually

(1:41:18) fare better financially that men who are married by a large degree report more happiness than men who are cohabitating

(1:41:25) or men who are single that data I think should give people hope because there is

(1:41:30) this push today not just by your platform but by others including on the left i think the left is actually

(1:41:35) especially pushing anti-marriage narratives even more than you or a few people kind of adjacent to the right

(1:41:40) saying "Oh marriage isn't worth it or just be you know do what you want to do sexually doesn't matter you know morals

(1:41:46) don't matter." But I think that the moral path is given to us for our flourishing and putting sex back in

(1:41:52) marriage where it belongs is given to us for both men and women's flourishing and it's also given to us for the

(1:41:58) flourishing of children because children deserve to be in a household with a loving mother and a loving father who

(1:42:04) are committed to each other for life and that that project is absolutely possible even if you come from a bo broken

(1:42:10) background i know people who have come from extreme broken backgrounds divorces cheating all kinds of horrible things

(1:42:15) and they have faithfully been married for 40 50 years and they are an incredible testament to the power of

(1:42:21) saying "I am strong i can love i can choose to do what is right even when it's hard and I'm going to commit to

(1:42:26) this person for life and they're going to be we're going to be in this together and raise a beautiful family together there are tons of those stories they may

(1:42:31) not always be on YouTube channels or on the internet but there are tons of those stories in our communities across the country and those give me a lot of hope

(1:42:37) as well as of course looking at the social data and I think the other thing that we need to say about marriage here is that marriage isn't just about what I

(1:42:43) can get marriage is also about what I can give and I think that that lens of understanding that marriage is about the

(1:42:48) gift of yourself for the other person going allin helps us understand that life isn't about me life is about

(1:42:54) together serving other people and building a project in care of other people in the in the case of a marriage

(1:43:00) the children that you might bring into the world and if we um I think uphold marriage as a beautiful thing not for

(1:43:06) everyone not everyone is called to marriage you don't have to be married I think to be happy or to be fulfilled but

(1:43:11) that it is a beautiful calling for many and even most people and that we should equip people with the tools to be uh

(1:43:18) more happily married by helping them grow in virtue helping them with things like having good role models good mentor

(1:43:24) couples i think this is where people should really get involved in faith communities Pearl because I think it's very hard to you know stay married even

(1:43:31) in a culture like ours i know you don't like me you know blaming the culture people should take responsibility of course people should take responsibility

(1:43:37) but the culture is pretty toxic today and so I think people need to find faith they need to find belief in God and a

(1:43:43) higher power they need to look at a moral pathway that is designed for our flourishing and they need to get in

(1:43:48) community with other people who are living the same way i think that's really important because if your community is like just an online

(1:43:54) community or your community is people that are just down and out and really upset and kind of always griping about how bad the world is and they're not

(1:44:00) wanting to commit they're not wanting to love yes you might feel yourself pretty miserable pretty hopeless but if you get

(1:44:06) plugged in with a community where there are healthy marriages there are thriving families as I'm blessed to be and I know many people who are blessed to be I

(1:44:13) think there's an opportunity for more hope and you're getting closer to not the dysfunction but the functional

(1:44:20) marriages that exist you can learn from those married couples you can find married couples that you can say "Hey how did you do it how did you how did

(1:44:26) you you know date and find a good spouse how did you you know build this project together and and weather the storms

(1:44:32) together?" Um and then you make faith a part of your life and you pray to God i do think faith is crucial for all of us

(1:44:37) men and women to ask God God what do you want me to do with my life how how do you want me to live what what's your purpose for me and I think God can guide

(1:44:44) you and give you hope and consolation so you're not living with fear in knowing

(1:44:50) how you should direct your life and the decisions that you should make you're still listing things one last

(1:44:56) thing actually I need to say one last thing to address something you said go ahead go ahead thanks for listening you

(1:45:01) said this thing you made this comment you had a lot of comments you made but the comment about men you know are

(1:45:06) looking at pornography because they're not they're being denied marriage i think that was largely speaking the

(1:45:11) point which is I think a crazy point i think pornography is a poison corn sorry

(1:45:17) excuse me pornography is a poison inside and outside of marriage so just because someone's married getting married is not

(1:45:23) going to solve uh sexual addiction issues if someone has them um getting married is not going to solve you know

(1:45:29) vices that someone might have right they will bring those into the marriage and they will need to work on those right so

(1:45:35) I think just saying like "Oh marriage is gonna solve uh porn addiction getting fat or sexual addiction." I think that's

(1:45:41) actually not a good argument to make yeah well I mean a lot of it's the wife getting fat too

(1:45:47) um but you're saying I think that's totally untrue but we can agree 80% of women gain 20 pounds or more in the

(1:45:53) first five years of marriage 80% 20 pounds is a lot that's a lot of fat

(1:45:59) well I I'm going to guess a lot of that i do think there's a lot of weight gain around getting pregnant and sometimes it

(1:46:04) can be hard to lose the weight after pregnancy that's an excuse my mom ran a marathon you guys are soft like

(1:46:13) um but you keep listing stuff i would still go back to everything you listed was that men should sacrifice for

(1:46:19) society so you you still haven't listed anything just to be clear Pearl men and women just to be clear Pearl this is

(1:46:25) really important men and women it's not like oh men do all men should be the sacrificial ones and women shouldn't

(1:46:31) sacrifice no in a marriage you go all in 100% the woman and the man it should not be I'm going to leave some cards on the

(1:46:37) table what are women's What are women's duties to you're saying what are women's duties

(1:46:43) in a marriage love to love their husbands faithfully uh exclusively of

(1:46:49) course to be open to being a mother i think I think that is a duty and to be uh a nourishing loving nurturing mother

(1:46:57) uh if they're able to have children of course some women are not able to have children um to respect their husbands to

(1:47:03) try to make their husband's lives better easier should they obey their husbands in all things largely speaking yeah they

(1:47:10) should sub I think there's a um important largely speaking or biblical I think there's an important biblical

(1:47:16) teaching about submission and I think the husband is the tiebreaker and that's a good thing in a household

(1:47:23) okay but women aren't having kids so what what are I mean again

(1:47:29) you're kind of painting the broad brush all there's definitely a lot of women that are are having kids um some women

(1:47:35) don't want kids and I think statistically not that's tragic for many of them statistically not true women are if women are having kids they're having

(1:47:40) kids in their 30s which you have a much higher likelihood of having a kid with autism or something else wrong with it

(1:47:47) so so how does that relate back to I'm asking what we were discussing well I'm

(1:47:53) asking what women's duties are they're not having kids so what are what do the men get what do the women have to bring

(1:47:59) to the table well I think I do think it is a duty of marriage to be open to life so I think if you go into marriage

(1:48:05) and saying "I'm not going to have any kids i don't want kids." It's a burden i don't I think that's an anti-marriage ultimately attitude yeah and I totally

(1:48:12) agree but that's not what women are doing that's like again it goes back to the idealistic and realistic well what

(1:48:20) would be nice versus what is you know men are like "Oh that sounds great my

(1:48:27) wife not getting fat that sounds great kid that sounds great a 22year-old that

(1:48:33) wants to get married that sounds great where are they?" I mean I I again I I I know you don't

(1:48:39) like to use personal examples you kind of make these broad brush generalizations but um you know there

(1:48:44) absolutely are statistically many people getting married there are millions of married people in this country uh so I I

(1:48:52) don't know what you're where you're going with the point if your point is that marriage is in disarray if your point is that it's you know can be hard

(1:48:58) to get married in today's culture I agree with you on all that i don't think we disagree on that my point is that

(1:49:04) and here's another data point the fertility rate in uh faith communities is usually much higher so you're going

(1:49:11) to have people who are faith-based having more kids and why is that right the reason for that is they're going

(1:49:18) into marriage with an understanding of what the purpose is and they're supporting each other in the beautiful

(1:49:23) project of building families so that's again another reason why faith is such a key component I think to everything here

(1:49:30) especially with with regard to healthy marriages my point is that tradcons have a tendency to list all of the things men

(1:49:38) need to do in sacrifice and not have women do anything in return or little to

(1:49:44) nothing um nothing is more important to women than their selfish desires and

(1:49:50) that's what they tend to do so I wish it wasn't so but that's the market

(1:49:59) all right i mean like I said you can paint as many generalizations as you you want all day long about women about men

(1:50:06) and I can keep coming back with data about married men being happier and about married men being you know having

(1:50:13) more uh uh financial success things like that so those are key data points i know you've kind of dismissed them well those

(1:50:19) don't really count but I do think that you know the negativity about marriage is a is a problem today i think that

(1:50:27) marriage is a beautiful beautiful good thing that has made a lot of people um a

(1:50:33) lot when a lot of people choose it they build a project together they bring life into the world i think without marriages

(1:50:38) and strong marriages we don't really have we're not going to have a functioning society and the biggest problems in society are because of a

(1:50:45) breakdown of the family well right but that goes to what society gets out of marriage not men so you just kind of

(1:50:51) diverted it now it's like what does society Well we get a a safe society you are way talking past me my friend you're

(1:50:56) you're I listening very closely it sounds like you have a script you repeat again and

(1:51:02) again and you're not I don't know that we're talking to each other right now because you know I I am talking about

(1:51:09) men that you know statistically speaking report being happier in marriage they're more financially successful in marriage

(1:51:16) and you keep saying well you're not talking about what men get out of marriage but it's like you didn't hear what I I just said did are you hearing

(1:51:22) what I'm saying say that the divorce stats cancel out the marriage stats because men are nine times more likely

(1:51:27) to commit suicide after a divorce and more veterans have committed suicide than all of the world wars combined

(1:51:35) and a good a good percentage of those were from horrible yeah a good percent were from when the Iraq war happened and

(1:51:41) they came back and their wife was banging some dude you know you know how it goes yeah I mean I I think that's

(1:51:47) absolutely heartbreaking so I but I don't think that the risk of divorce

(1:51:52) means means that someone should not pursue marriage especially if they're feeling called to it i I don't think

(1:51:57) that risks I mean you get in a car and you risk getting in a car accident and you risk dying right life is full of

(1:52:05) risks so the question is how am I going to how will I live my life um love is a risk bringing a child into the world is

(1:52:11) a risk um love is a risk so I'm not going to say "Oh you're going to be so safe everything's going to be easy

(1:52:16) there's never going to be a problem in your life." But I will say according to the social data men who are married

(1:52:22) report that they are very happy significantly more than men who cohabitate or men who are single that is

(1:52:28) survey data with men themselves saying this is how I experience my life it's their information so you can choose to

(1:52:34) believe it or not and men are financially who are married they do better than men who are unmarried and

(1:52:40) even those men who get divorced are still doing better than the men who never got married in the first place

(1:52:47) right but I would still say that the divorce rate when the average marriage is seven to eight years that does cancel

(1:52:52) out pretty much everything you said i don't think that applies at all i

(1:52:58) don't think I would say that men are nine times more likely to commit suicide that cancels that out uh women mostly

(1:53:04) put men on child support and alimony i would say that cancels it out i would say when a man has to risk 40% of his

(1:53:12) income up to 18 years that's a long time so there's also if we want to talk more

(1:53:17) about data here there's also the data about again back to the faith communities and people who have faith

(1:53:23) people who seek a higher purpose for their marriage for their lives there are uh surveys that show that those that

(1:53:30) pray together in their marriage and attend weekly church services the divorce rate can be as low as 2% yeah

(1:53:36) I've seen that but it's a pretty small sample size um is one problem with that study and the other issue is uh it's

(1:53:43) taking people pretty good those are I mean are those good odds in Europe in your mind well the if I thought they

(1:53:49) were accurate they would be but it's again you guys always want to push religion and that's what you guys are selling in general so what you guys tend

(1:53:57) to do is you take these studies and extrapolate them like they mean something but they're very small sample

(1:54:02) sizes one you include Gen X and Boomer women which were in very different

(1:54:07) circumstances than the women today is problem number two um they also included

(1:54:12) millennials in the divorce rate for that study so the the challenge is if the

(1:54:18) average mar So I'm a millennial so you just dismissed so you just dismissed you just dismissed the study about those

(1:54:23) that pray together and go to church divorce rates as low as 2% what's this what's you said it's too small as a sample how big is a sample well the

(1:54:29) other the other issue I can't remember off the top of my head but I've looked at it before the other issue assuming

(1:54:35) it's too small i mean here's the thing no I'm not i've read it before but the the it was kind of a lot you know if you

(1:54:42) gave me a list before the debate I could have went through it but the which is fine i didn't expect you to do that but

(1:54:48) the other the other challenge um you have with it is they include and I I I the reason I'm saying this is because I

(1:54:54) want people to be it to be accurate and people to be informed about how they tend to lie to you to push their

(1:55:01) religion i'm not saying it's malicious i don't I mean here here's here's something the the challenge is if you

(1:55:06) include millennial women you're including people that haven't divorced yet because if the average divorce is um

(1:55:12) it's around eight years then when the kids hit a high school if you make it past 25 you're you're kind of going to

(1:55:18) make it but uh statistically but they're including people that haven't divorced

(1:55:23) yet is one challenge um in very sect communities so go ahead i'm I'm curious

(1:55:29) how you see risk because I I think it's like a worldview question right so I've been talking about the fact that men who

(1:55:35) are married are more financially successful than men who are unmarried and then even men who divorced are still

(1:55:40) more financially successful than the men who never married you know the surveys that show that men who are married

(1:55:45) report higher levels of happiness than men who are unmarried or men cohabitating so there's all that data right and then there's all the anecdotes

(1:55:51) we could talk about that as well we could talk about faith communities and the divorce rate being low as 2% in faith communities so we can talk about

(1:55:58) all of that but I think what underpins it sounds like to me your worldview is this idea of risk well bad things could

(1:56:04) happen in some cases men you know may experience may get divorced right and then they might you know be suicidal and

(1:56:11) there's this horrific there's tons of horrific sto horror stories out there right so I'm curious like when you get

(1:56:16) in your car like I don't know if you drive or you walk where you live but when you get in your car you are taking the risk you are taking a risk of your

(1:56:22) own life actually because there are car accidents i think it's like one out of every hundred people are going to get in a car accident right so you're taking

(1:56:28) this risk of getting in a car accident possibly risking your life but you still get in your car so how do you decide i'm

(1:56:35) curious how do you decide how you choose what risks to take and how do you what is your do you have a recommendation for

(1:56:41) how people should weigh risk or you're just saying I'm putting the risk information out there men naturally weigh the risk versus the reward if you

(1:56:48) had you responded and I've been asking so do you ever talk about the rewards of marriage pearl right if if there were

(1:56:54) some now like men 100 years ago any rewards to marriage girl are you gonna let me finish or no okay so a hundred

(1:57:00) years ago men got a virgin bride at like 22 they got a young hot wife um that had

(1:57:07) been with zero other men and they got like six kids risk versus reward that's a pretty good reward today they get an

(1:57:15) exho or someone that says they weren't a hoe but still marrying around 30 so it's like [ __ ] what were you doing the last

(1:57:21) decade don't have to believe you um three um that they also get one maybe

(1:57:27) two kids half the time it's going to be via IVF um they get no she's actually

(1:57:33) paid to leave you and steal your children and ruin your reputation and if you start a business you can take that

(1:57:39) too um half the time they don't even want to stay home so if I think and I'm

(1:57:45) I'm just you know putting myself in a man's shoes 40% of my income for 18

(1:57:52) years for an ex ho that'll give me one kid that could be [ __ ] because she's

(1:57:58) having it in her 30s i don't know if that's the best sell and I keep saying "Well what do I get?" And then you guys

(1:58:05) say "Well my study says they'll be happier." And I'm like "Well does the women stay fit does she have to have sex

(1:58:12) with him well we can't say that well uh this isn't a great cell i There's no God

(1:58:19) in divorce court and I've seen women that were more religious than you Laya

(1:58:24) that did terrible things god awful thing women that aren't on the internet women

(1:58:30) that had like 10 kids and married at 22 and they did terrible things i don't

(1:58:36) think that's the same thing as a car accident and if I get in my car every

(1:58:42) ride there's not like a 15% chance that somebody's going to ruin my life for 20

(1:58:47) years that's a pretty big risk so I would recommend that people

(1:58:53) look up those that are listening to the show right now look up the statistics the information the survey data on men's

(1:58:59) wealth who are married um sexual you know the amount of sex people have and how happy they are their sex lives they

(1:59:05) care about money Laya they care about their kids let me just finish they want to see their children see this is the

(1:59:12) same this is the problem you're talking about money before their kids they want to be We're totally talking past each other right now no they want to be there

(1:59:18) from birth till the kid is 18 i know men they'll spend money they don't like

(1:59:24) they'll give up like money isn't the end of the world but it's paying for a wife

(1:59:29) that's screwing another dude and spending more time with your kid than you are that's hell that's death girl if

(1:59:35) if men want to have children if men don't want children they shouldn't get married but if men want to have children

(1:59:40) the best way to protect their rights is actually getting married if you are a single father who's not married you know

(1:59:47) the the the woman that you had the child with is you're not married to her you will have less rights actually for your

(1:59:53) child so if you're arguing that you know men who want kids shouldn't be married because of marriage being you know some

(2:00:00) sort of a threat to their rights actually being a man who's not married having a woman that with having a child

(2:00:05) with a woman you have less rights in that situation you get more rights with a surrogate if we want to go down that

(2:00:11) route well then the then the child doesn't isn't being raised by the woman you love and the mother so that's a

(2:00:16) problem so I think Yeah but then you can't kidnap you can't kidnap the child either there's pros and cons for

(2:00:22) everything it seems to me that you are recommending uh you know keep saying you

(2:00:28) keep saying Mary these hoes that's what I keep hearing mary man up man up that's

(2:00:33) why it seemed that's why you had um what's her face on redhead porn star

(2:00:39) pearl it seems to me that you're saying that you know it's not worth the risk doesn't check out in the end don't you

(2:00:44) know you're not saying don't do it because you say well I would never tell anyone what to do but you're kind of you know pushing really hard that's a lot of

(2:00:50) your statements on the show give them something Laya give them something but again I I just say look up the I know we

(2:00:56) got to wrap here it's We just hit the 7:00 button here but listen look up the information happier more happiness uh

(2:01:04) you know yes men who are married are financially more successful uh it is one of the most beautiful things if you're

(2:02:26) do these things they send their f I don't think Yla seems like a nice enough woman um but in general they tend to

(2:02:32) send their followers after me and doing this stuff man it's not for the faint of heart so if you can join my membersonly

(2:02:39) community at some point you will get to meet me if you join that um and I also bring on the smart intelligent men that

(2:02:45) I know and the occasional woman but let's not get carried

(2:02:50) away um the occasional woman to also come on and it's a one-time lifetime

(2:02:58) purchase and you're basically buying in because we're new uh saying Pearl is going to interview people for life and

(2:03:06) um I I at some point we're going to have some big names where you can actually directly ask them questions we're still

(2:03:13) getting it going but it's I had a dating coach on there i have a child support officer telling you how to avoid that so

(2:03:19) if you want to get if you do want to get married I do give you tools to alleviate risk um I'm going to read the super

(2:03:26) chats now i'm not going yet guys i'm not going i got supers all right can we do a poll

(2:03:34) do we think that she's going to come back i didn't mean

(2:03:42) to all right let's

(2:03:52) see what the hell oh it's cuz I got to do it on this laptop

(2:03:59) i forgot that one doesn't have access to the super

(2:04:04) chats also if you want to send a super chat for my efforts I I people do try to

(2:04:10) ruin my life over this stuff they really do demonetized for a year i would have loved to have gone to the voting thing

(2:04:17) guys but at right now all right 90% divorce rate equals risk ask Laya how

(2:04:22) does she feel about Christian women who are partly responsible for the rise of Only Fans and Corn because they didn't want to meet their husband's bedroom

(2:04:28) desires regularly oh that would have been a good question crazy finance is 50

(2:04:33) I'm 30 and fighting an illness through my 20s here comes Pearls calling other people an exho with nothing to offer

(2:04:40) yep pearl with um a knockout win over Li the Trad thought um Pearl lockin just

(2:04:46) stopped generalizing pearl women aren't having kids because they're dealing with chronic health issues in America yeah

(2:04:52) health issues from waiting a decade to have kids getting pregnant is another health issue they want them kids turn 10

(2:04:58) trade in for new Richard the TRCcons like her and Tommy Lauren can or won't answer what a man received for marriage

(2:05:04) because they believe they don't believe their husband should get anything laya doesn't care about these points because no one is perfect everyone is worth

(2:05:09) Jesus's forgiveness all of these points KU list can be correct god will use their arrogance to renew them um this

(2:05:15) girl needs to read Aaron Clary's book The Book of the Numbers based on her attitude you won't believe most of the data Aaron researched lead me only when

(2:05:22) I want to be led marriage um yeah love comes with risk from the man alone evangelical feminism like early '9s

(2:05:29) baptism marriage positive for one and the advantage guys I'm sorry I didn't do these during the show but I was trying

(2:05:36) to lock in you know what I mean i just couldn't um happiness surveys are

(2:05:41) absolute nonsense and men do not live for happiness this is a female metric it is driven by United Nations Pearl i sent

(2:05:47) you an email about high-profile United Nations leak Zoom meeting that exposes their anti-f family court agenda check

(2:05:53) your emails do your thing laya believes abortion and murder and says um perpetrator should be punished but wants

(2:05:59) to give women the get out of fr jail free card with coercion i feel like try like Laya is a fake TRCON feminist um

(2:06:06) greetings to Pearl and Oh wait that was from the last one i'm going to refresh it uh let me just see if

(2:06:14) anyone Okay should I react to one more video while I'm live or should we call it doug

(2:06:21) MPA you get to pick why don't actually Doug MPA can you send get on the hop on this Zoom let's do a post show talk what

(2:06:28) did you think uh Doug MPA gives me feedback on like debates and that sort

(2:06:34) of thing so I mean he might we might as well just do this live because you know we were

(2:06:40) going to talk after anyway we might as well bring the fans in you know um I

(2:06:47) could react to this other thing but no we'll do that tomorrow tomorrow I'll do

(2:06:53) the reaction but I will bring up Doug MPA

(2:07:05) uh let me see the poll will she come back i would totally debate her about

(2:07:10) this again or if she has something she wants

(2:07:20) to not should she i said will she

(2:07:28) is he coming on let me just double check i'll text him get

(2:07:40) on oh isn't it in the chat it's in the chat just scroll

(2:07:47) up hold on i'm going to send it i'll send

(2:07:54) it here we go

(2:08:02) yeah me and Andrew are good guys we're pals like we have disagreements

(2:08:10) but you know it just

(2:08:17) Hey can you hear me doug MPA how are you give me one second let me turn the

(2:08:23) YouTube off i'm good how'd I do you can be honest tell the YouTube people

(2:08:29) um the the abortion thing too long i like

(2:08:36) your stance on it cuz I agree it's just people were misconring guys what what

(2:08:41) Pearl is trying to say is you're never going to stop women from aborting children never so you only have 365 days

(2:08:50) in a year 52 weeks 24 hours in a day so you have to focus on things that are

(2:08:56) actually attainable in our lifetime women's right to to have an

(2:09:01) abortion is never going to go away so there are things that you can affect more than that i'm sorry so Pearl is

(2:09:07) pro-life but she's just accepted that women are women will not give that power

(2:09:12) away so but other than other than that I think the abortion conversation went on

(2:09:18) a little too long but other than that you just cooked Laya she cannot answer

(2:09:23) all these dragcons cannot answer the question what does a man get what does he get and if you guys if you guys are

(2:09:30) interested um second link in the chat is the GoFundMe for the divorce documentary

(2:09:35) we would love to finish if we can get funding um we would love to finish it but you

(2:09:42) know we got to get to 100K we got 25K which is really great you guys are awesome but if you want you know send us

(2:09:48) send us something there go ahead yeah doug is biased for Pearl he He can't give

(2:09:55) constructive criticism well one that is true i am biased for Pearl i've been

(2:10:00) supporting Pearl since she had 17,000 subs and two one of the reasons why Pearl and I work well together is I let

(2:10:06) her you know I give her honest feedback oh he gives me feedback oh believe me we

(2:10:12) want to we got to fund raise so Doug MPA can can come in person yeah but but Laya

(2:10:20) you um I know your feels about Laya and you I think you kept it civil um I think

(2:10:27) that you and her have fundamental disagreements i think that Yla's a fake Dragcon and one of the things one of the

(2:10:33) best parts about Pearl is Pearl is a fake Drag Con crusader there too many of

(2:10:38) those out there and Yla's one of them she's nice but um you didn't go over the

(2:10:46) $14 million for her nonprofit i wanted to but there was you know and only like

(2:10:52) 85,000 of it went towards lobbying and like 14,000 went to donations and she kept the rest oh my god she kept that

(2:10:59) much yeah uh-huh according to the tax documents

(2:11:04) holy [ __ ] yeah i went over them uh well should I say allegedly i don't want you

(2:11:12) to get in trouble yeah I'm going to say allegedly just in case but I looked I looked over the dock

(2:11:17) anyway yeah so but Laya just keeps saying marry these hoes guys all the

(2:11:22) trackons all they all they can say is marry these hoes it's your duty and put society and women over

(2:11:29) yourself and also she kept saying that that whole equality debate i don't

(2:11:34) understand how women can be religious but then say that men and women are equal when men provide more

(2:11:42) value yeah so I just she tried all the track con typical and techniques but she

(2:11:48) got nothing guys Pearl will never tell you to not get married but you got to cons cuz look

(2:11:56) guys all of us red pillars we can say don't get married but most guys are going to get married in my lifetime

(2:12:03) sorry but if you acknowledge you're taking a bad deal then you can figure out then you can prepare accordingly

(2:12:10) yeah yeah you can mitigate risk and then you know you'll know exactly what

(2:12:15) happened not if but when she leaves you cuz what's% of college educated women

(2:12:23) um divorce their husbands 90% come on guys yeah like if um like if you if you

(2:12:30) guys are a 30-year-old guy and you want to get married then you know by 40 you can be you can go for your wife number

(2:12:35) two 100% you can plan you could be like oh you know what the the 30-year-old

(2:12:41) didn't work out now I can now now at 40 I feel like 40's got to be easier dating

(2:12:47) as a guy is fifth than 50 you you could you guys could tell me but I just imagine at some point you got to age out

(2:12:53) of the 20s year olds is that true or no i don't know well they say that guys between the age

(2:13:00) of 42 and 50 are the most desirous men on in society period well do you know

(2:13:07) what I was thinking though i think they're going to get them and I don't know this is hypothetical

(2:13:14) um you guys would be able to tell me more but I see um men getting the most

(2:13:22) matches in those age groups because um they're matching with like the 30 year

(2:13:28) olds the 50 year olds the 40 year olds and some 20 year olds but if I had to

(2:13:34) guess like the women between 0 to 30 are still going to match the most with guys

(2:13:39) in their like mid30s to 40s rather than 50s but I could be wrong you're on the

(2:13:45) app so you tell me and like you have guy friends around that age I'm guessing so

(2:13:50) yeah yeah i would say 25 year old women don't go past 40 30-year-old women don't

(2:13:57) go past 45 35 year old women don't go past uh 50 so I think that there's a

(2:14:04) 15-year limit for each age of the woman yeah un there's exceptions obviously

(2:14:10) like Leonardo DiCaprio and like whatever but just like in general that's what I've seen

(2:14:16) what is this whole virtuous women thing guys in the chat help us with this virtuous woman

(2:14:22) thing what does that even mean cuz here's the thing what in women are

(2:14:27) rewarded for un for for um for acting without virtue and what can keep a woman

(2:14:35) virtuous even if you marry virtuous woman what can keep her virtuous

(2:14:40) nothing and if she stops cuz remember virtue is based on actions you have to

(2:14:46) your your actions have to be virtuous women are rewarded for actions that are not virtuous so this whole trad Oh you

(2:14:54) get a virtuous woman oh really where and for how long

(2:14:59) right she's virtuous right now just curious why don't proifers advocate for a ban on divorce after marriage produces

(2:15:06) children they just want to make money and and virtue signal that's generally what I've

(2:15:12) seen there are some people that really care

(2:15:18) but you know you could care at like 50 grand a year and they never take that

(2:15:23) money they can make sure every cent goes towards these children and they never

(2:15:31) Yeah it's just Laya Tommy Lauren they just can't help the feminism man what it

(2:15:37) Andrew Wilson say to Tommy Lauren there's that feminism it always rears

(2:15:42) its ugly head man when pressed TRCON women will will speak the same talking

(2:15:48) points as feminists and what do I always say why fake dracons are worse than the

(2:15:56) feminist uh nature makes its most dangerous and poisonous things a weird

(2:16:02) shape or a bright color so feminists usually have purple hair that seep them

(2:16:07) piercing tattoos so you can spot them easy but these fake tagcons they don't

(2:16:12) look like like that at all so they're hard to spot well

(2:16:18) um yeah I agree uh so if you were to have her on

(2:16:24) again what would you talk about the next time i just enjoyed cooking to be honest um

(2:16:29) maybe the embezzlement um I mean if she if if there was ever

(2:16:35) something in the news I totally would have her on like it's something that's like relevant in the news we had a

(2:16:41) different take on she wanted to come back she totally could i don't I don't know i don't think she will i think I

(2:16:47) cooked too hard but I don't know maybe she will

(2:16:52) yeah I um you know once you talk to one of these Trackcons you talk to every single one of them it's the same

(2:16:58) arguments guys let me know put a one in the chat if you knew where she was going

(2:17:03) before she even said it or put a two if you heard anything new tonight so put a one in the chat if you heard every

(2:17:10) single other TRC con fake Trackcon argument or put a two if you heard anything new

(2:17:19) nothing yeah but yeah you know I think you especially you and her vehemently

(2:17:26) disagree on certain things that it was civil you know um I just once again she

(2:17:32) has nothing all these tracks guys just marry these hoes just do it men are

(2:17:39) supposed to be um hack mules for women and society

(2:17:45) you're supposed to get nothing out of it and and how dare you ask what a woman is going to give you back for sacrificing

(2:17:52) your emotional mental spiritual health monetary health for for a woman how dare
