(0:00) [Music] hello what up guys we are live so we have a pretty fun panel for you today we
(0:05) got Andrew from The Crucible Corey who's going to be arguing for the left torso you know Lauren's been on a channel before Destiny you know he's been on a
(0:11) channel million times and his lovely friends so we're going to be debating two different topics the first topic
(0:17) that we're going to be debating is is the meu movement a good idea we're going to let this go for about 45 minutes an
(0:23) hour for that one topic depending on how interesting gets then we'll move on to the second topic the second topic will be uh who is more pressed in America men
(0:29) or women so those are the topics we've chosen all the guests have been told the topics I'm generally a hands-off
(0:35) moderator so I will only get involved under two things number one if one person is getting interrupted so bad that they can't get a word in for like a
(0:41) long period of time or number two the conversation is completely derailing and it's just going way off track and I feel
(0:47) like someone's uh you know just derailing the conversation other than that you won't hear much from me I'll literally just be in the background uh
(0:53) the way I typically do this is I allow the uh everyone to give a brief opening statement because I think it's good for
(0:58) you guys to know what the other person's position positions are uh you know two or three minutes probably keep it under that and uh then we just get into the
(1:05) open portion of it and then typically we'll do like a minute long closing statement but yeah uh I'll let it go for
(1:11) as long as it's interesting but again somewhere between 45 minutes to an hour per topic uh okay so once again the
(1:16) first topic is is me too movement overall a good idea or a bad idea and uh
(1:22) Andrew do you mind kicking it off since you're first in line yeah sure I can do that so I would say that me too and the
(1:30) spiral of believe all women um I tend to believe all women sure but I also believe all men so I think that men who
(1:38) say that they're innocent should be believed as much as women who make allegations I think that's fair across the board when it comes to me too itself
(1:45) I think that the societal kind of damage which has happened from it has not been good for the relationships between men
(1:50) and women especially in the workplace and external even to the workplace the trust level has drastically gone down as
(1:57) men in positions of power don't seem to want to work with women very much anymore um including attractive women I
(2:02) was just reading a survey about this this morning it's a little bit older but I was looking up some of the newer data
(2:08) and they definitely have trust issues a lot of men have begun to have trust issues with women um due to the fact
(2:16) that they can just be um you know accused of doing something that they never even did and then their whole life
(2:22) gets uh basically ruined so yeah I don't I don't think in retrospect it was a
(2:28) great idea cool Corey uh yeah so on the whole I would
(2:33) say overall a good idea uh and overall good movement even though there are totally some drawbacks in terms of what
(2:39) Andrew brought up in terms of you know believe all women there might be in some instances too much benefit of the doubt
(2:45) however if you just look at uh you know the rates of false reporting or false allegations like they do happen they are a thing but it's a very small minority
(2:52) uh and that to I guess what Andrew brought up of like a lack of trust in women uh I would say probably be overall
(2:57) poor decision-making uh if like if your concern is like the small minority like the slim minority with false allegations
(3:03) versus hiring a competent person especially if you look at education rates of women uh you're probably passing up a lot of competence just
(3:08) because uh you have just a very small concern uh with false allegations uh like the trust issue I think it's like a
(3:14) non-issue uh so overall on the whole good but there are some negative drawbacks to it uh but yeah that's where
(3:19) I stand for now cool awesome let's go with torso next
(3:25) yeah here I have a link for everybody put it in the chat right now so until we
(3:31) can accurately report rape statistics I think it's a bunch of [ __ ] and
(3:37) that's it thank you okay short and sweet uh Lauren um I really appreciated Andrew's
(3:46) opening uh statement because I think the false accusations have played detrimental effect on a lot of men's
(3:53) lives and so for and I thought it was really interesting how Corey combed that with well it's such a small portion um
(4:00) it doesn't really matter that it's a whether or not it's the majority or the minority uh there we just know that
(4:08) there are a portion of women who are lying about this and absolutely destroying men's lives and the me too
(4:14) movement has actively changed legislation in a way to make it so that
(4:20) laws actually make it easier for men to be convicted or at least penalized um
(4:26) whether it's laws or byst standards in like School standards have made it easier for men to get penalized even if
(4:33) there's not sufficient evidence to prove that they've committed the crime do you want to add anything maybe
(4:41) later all right Destiny um here you go first so the
(4:46) question is oh wait are we doing are other people here speaking why didn't pixie say anything I don't
(4:52) know I don't want to like impose uh okay so here's what we do since both of you guys have friends they
(4:58) can get in on it but I don't want it to be like where like a massive like you know like a thre person in one package
(5:05) so let it go well I'm a moderator let me make the rules so you can you can uh like for
(5:12) example if you're like okay want you answer this question you can give your perspective but it shouldn't be like you guys get three times at the time because
(5:18) three amount of people hopefully that makes sense but yeah so you guys can all give your quick take in the opening statement okay quick take go for it okay
(5:24) so do I think the me too movement was overall good yeah basically is it overall good or bad I think it was
(5:30) overall good that doesn't mean it was perfect but I think like men being falsely accused and actually having
(5:35) actual consequences for that that actually were detrimental to their life I don't think that was a very common occurrence however I do think that there
(5:42) were certain behaviors that were just put in with like the like oh if a guy smiles at you it's this and that I I
(5:48) don't think that I think there was times and certain behaviors that weren't actually that bad that women were
(5:54) perceiving as bad just because it was the internet and then it was so I do think that happened I don't want to ramble
(6:00) cool hi guys um all right I would say that with any movement there's going to be people who piggyback on it who don't
(6:07) have good intentions but overall it had to happen otherwise it would just keep
(6:13) continuing to be ignored that women are treated like they're just
(6:20) accessible yeah I think we're all in a of this camp we all agree I think it was a good idea good movement sometimes it
(6:25) goes a little bit too far but I think that the um the false like men rape accusations or whatever I think are D
(6:31) drastically overblown I know there are a few big cases where it's happened but I think overall having people talking more
(6:36) about this is is probably the most important thing that's come out about this cool all right we're gonna move to the open Panel part so anyone just just
(6:43) have added let the blood bath begin uh I have a question actually for Lauren because you brought up uh laws were
(6:48) passed that allowed you know let's say convictions or something as a result of insufficient evidence so what laws were
(6:53) passed specifically that's actually a really good question so they changed the evidentiary standards in a lot of states for what uh how women are required to
(7:00) testify so you have like a sixth amendment constitutional right to like face your accuser and they've uh changed
(7:08) some of the constitutionality so for instance in child saay cases uh a lot of
(7:13) times children don't actually have to go up on the stand they could do a deposition they could talk beforehand because it's a child and they've shifted
(7:19) some of the laws to also affect women in the same way that they've protected children in the past um and then and
(7:25) then not just actual state laws there's also school policies and that's the big
(7:31) one for me so for instance like the UC policy on how to affect or how to deal
(7:37) with uh sexual assault accusations completely change so as soon as someone
(7:43) is accused of sexual assault they believe the woman as opposed to doing before like and they started the process
(7:50) of like removing the man from her classes and then start the penalization process um and so there are men who have
(7:58) been penalized before and and a lot of the uc's in other schools have walked back some of what
(8:04) they've done because they went too far and then they they have curtailed it somewhat when they've penalized men who
(8:10) have been proven to be innocent when women later came back saying yes I lied because I had a boyfriend at the time or
(8:16) yes I lied for instance there was um do you guys remember the mattress girl yeah
(8:22) They Carried the mattress around okay so like that's like a perfect example of somebody who who lied
(8:28) in the school really supported her and then they walked back some of how wait Shand was she lying about her story or I
(8:34) don't think so was she she was okay Sor I don't walk around the mattress I just
(8:40) want to clarify because like you brought up so from what I gathered what you said when it comes to like laws seems like
(8:46) the large changes were just like uh use the example of uh children don't have to face their abuser so women don't have to
(8:52) face their abuser for some states for some instances that's the major change that has occurred overall they don't have to go on like uh they don't have to
(8:59) face their accusers in the same way different evidentiary standards are lowered so what are the so what what
(9:06) specific like so for instance like um past acts are treated differently so
(9:14) for there's uh when you're trying to show past actions and evidence a lot of the times you can't show um just because
(9:21) somebody is typically for for example just because someone's typically a bad driver you can't use that as evidence to
(9:27) show that they got in a car crash on this one specific occasion however if
(9:33) you have somebody who's like constantly turning left when they're not allowed to at a red light then you could use that
(9:40) as evidence that they turned left on a specific instance at that particular R red light so like there's the way that
(9:48) you look at evidence based off the situation um they used to exclude evidence so like if a man was like
(9:54) sexually aggressive they would tend to exclude that evidence in the past now they're making the statute so maybe they
(10:00) so that they would allow more of that type of evidence to come in if he was sexually aggressive in the past then he
(10:05) might have been sexually aggressive in this instance wait but yeah why is that a bad thing so in the so just like I try to
(10:12) explain with that car situation just because you were a bad driver in the past doesn't mean that you like actually
(10:19) got in that car crash so just because you are sexually you potentially could be a sexually aggressive person or other
(10:24) people have perceived you as sexually aggressive that doesn't mean that you were sexually aggressive in that instance
(10:29) however if you have a particular like sexual aggression against um a
(10:34) particular person and a particular situation I think that would be more uh more like the left turn scenario however
(10:42) the just a Qui clarifying question on that isn't it the case that for a lot of crimes like certain types of character
(10:47) evidence like that is admissible when you're trying to determine the culpability of somebody or having committed a crime so
(10:53) itend I'm trying to explain like the difference between like the two types of character evidence so if you're trying
(10:59) show like someone is based off their character they committed the crime it's only allowed in for certain situations
(11:06) so like if you're um like perent perpetu propensity you're not allowed to
(11:12) show it for propensity situation so it's actually not allowed in most crimes however with sexual assault they are
(11:19) allowing that type of evidence in they're allowing what type of evidence character evidence so the rape you're
(11:25) saying they went back on rapes shield laws because I because you know with rape Shield laws you're actually not allowed to and this was way before me
(11:31) too where you're not allowed to bring in any evidence of a woman's past sexual activity in a rape case to prove consent
(11:38) for instance so those things have been around way before me no I'm talking about sexual aggression I'm talking
(11:44) about like evidence of his sexual aggression evidence that he or people
(11:49) are like claiming that he um for example wasn't saying taking into consideration a girls like no or was still like
(11:55) pushing forward that now that's allowed in the court of law that character right
(12:01) exactly so like for like you would know for um what Jazz right Jazz yeah jasine
(12:07) sorry Jasmine um so for most character evidence it's
(12:13) actually not allowed to come into court for yeah uh so like I I I was trying to give a better example
(12:20) um I was trying to give a better example than the left turn and the bad driving example but do you understand what I'm
(12:27) saying well well I was trying to read for what the I wasn't completely listening I was trying
(12:32) to read for what changes you're saying that me to like which states implemented the changes that you're talking about
(12:38) and I'm seeing a lot of changes that actually are good like the way that they would uh they started um extending
(12:45) statute of limitations throwing out um ndas like I think those are changes that
(12:50) came out of the me movement that were largely good because it is really hard to get a rape to actually get a
(12:55) successful um rape conviction and those are some of of the barriers that we're getting in the way better testing and
(13:01) for the rape kits all of that so I was just I think the statute of limitations is actually like a really interesting
(13:08) example because when you look up I think the reason that you have the statute of limitations in the first place is
(13:13) because you lose evidentiary uh value over evidence as time goes on when
(13:19) you're trying to pursue it in court from like the time that the incident happened until the time that the court case
(13:24) actually occurs so you're losing evidence in between that time and then uh so it so have the same standard case
(13:33) you look at the Trump case you look at the Biden case you look at all of these accusers coming decades later and
(13:38) accusing them of sexual assault and because we have these statute of limitations extended it's it's making it
(13:45) easier for women to make accusations and I think it's uh giving
(13:53) more this burden of proof is still the same even they can make the accusations later L on that doesn't help them if
(14:00) they don't have the evidence that actually makes it harder like absolutely it if you recuse someone 20 years later
(14:06) with less evidence people are going to be way more forgiving than if you accuse somebody a week later and have no
(14:11) evidence Lauren James ston who's a New York divorce attorney he's pretty high-profile he's in my chat and he says
(14:17) you're full of [ __ ] and you don't know what you're talking about I love James I love Jameson yeah I
(14:26) don't instruction they say feel like you know and now sorry I don't want to take too much Destiny my time no you're good
(14:34) more like on what part was full of [ __ ] yeah I'll ask him James uh which part
(14:40) was she full of [ __ ] about I'll get back to you when he gives me an answer thank you he usually does that in Super Chat
(14:45) form which is awesome that's nice of him okay um and yeah no like I would I would
(14:53) say like certain things that you mentioned like I do agree it is nicer to have the ability to
(15:00) turn like I do have a lot of empathy for people who have been stuck in a
(15:05) situation where they've been assaulted like that that being said you shouldn't be allowed to turn around 30 years later
(15:11) and accuse somebody there's a reason that we have the statute of limitation are they extending it that long I I
(15:16) don't know how long they're extending no you're saying that they're extending the statute of limitations I can look into it I don't going to 30 years and are you
(15:25) actually seeing where this is actually leading to cuz what my what I would say is that if they're stat extending the
(15:32) statute of limitations and these women are taking these men to court and actually getting a conviction and
(15:38) they're they're they're they're being found guilty you're saying that they're being found guilty when they shouldn't
(15:44) be is that what for instance like the Trump civil case that just occurred I
(15:49) don't think that there was enough evidence for a reasonable jury to find Trump guilty based off you know just the
(15:56) testimony alone but he was found guilty ask question on that for the Trump case are there and I just don't
(16:03) know this so the lawyers can answer is there a statute of limitations on civil
(16:08) litigation is there yeah yes yes well sex says that her explanation of the
(16:14) concept of Prior bad acts is totally inaccurate and the evidentiary standards related to the child testimony didn't
(16:20) change due to me too I didn't say the child change I said the way that they treated women was is now I don't know if
(16:27) it was actually proposed or if it change but they I saw something that proposed
(16:32) that they change the evidentiary standards for women to reflect more similarly proposal or an actual change
(16:39) have concern okay I saw changes of in Legislation during the me too movement I
(16:45) I suppose I should have done a little bit more research to see if it actually was a proposal versus whether or not it
(16:50) was enacted but I did see changes in legislation or proposed changes in legislation that I thought were
(16:56) detrimental coming out of the me too movements specifically the lack in evidentiary standards when it came to
(17:03) accusing men okay but it's possible that's just proposal right now and nothing actually changed so you'd have no issue if nothing changed but what
(17:09) wasn't proposal was the UC Standards the UC Standards absolutely did change and then they retracted on that also so real
(17:16) quick so it seems like for New York state in May of 2022 the adult survivors Act was a piece of legislation that
(17:22) extended the statute limitations for looks like for civil suits um and then
(17:28) this expanded the ability of plaintiffs to sue for sexual assault and unwanted sexual contact in the workplace so yeah
(17:33) good job me too that's all they got done that's it but I mean also do we want
(17:40) like an extension of the statute of limitations I don't even know if that's something that we do want well given
(17:45) that in New York stat was three years it was only three years that's
(17:51) insane okay that's really short they have it done in kind of a they have it done in kind of a sticky
(17:56) way so the statue limitations was 10 years but it looks like you could only bring suit if you had uh filed the
(18:02) actual complaint to the police within three years so they kind of have it set up that way so if you hadn't filed that complaint within three years then you
(18:09) essentially your statute limitations has expired so let's let torsa get a warden because she hasn't spoken once go ahead
(18:14) no I was just confused because I thought Lauren said that uh them extending the
(18:20) statue of limitations is a positive thing and I think that's absolutely [ __ ] no earlier when you were saying
(18:27) you were saying something like can you guys hear me you were saying um that you
(18:33) think that people will believe people after 20 years no I'm saying they'll I
(18:38) think they'll maybe I heard you after 20 more 20 years they'll give
(18:44) more them more leniency for not bringing hard evidence so for instance if like if
(18:50) I if pixie assaults me tonight and then 20 years later I accuse her they're not
(18:56) going to be like well why don't you have have you know the sheets why don't you have your clothes it's like well that was 20 years ago well did you get a rape
(19:04) kit right because I could say oh well it was 20 years ago super traumatic so there's all this evidence that is gone
(19:10) now and like just accept that evidence is gone so just off of word of mouth that's
(19:16) what you guys were arguing that's my issue that like if if you allow people to turn around and accuse people decades
(19:23) later that's my issue because it's you're going to be losing evidence and the jury's going to have it's going to
(19:28) be more acceptable to lose that evidence but that same evidence the defense deserves and has a right to review as
(19:35) well and that evidence is just gone and nobody gets it and then it's in the benefit of the woman because well of
(19:42) course it's 20 years later why why would she keep why would she keep her clothes but feminists are also saying that right
(19:48) now women don't like they're saying you should believe women because regardless if they didn't get an STD test or
(19:55) something because they were traumatized a lot of feminist are arguing right now that we shouldn't care about that stuff
(20:01) and that you should believe them and so a lot of people are saying well you need the kit but you're saying that well it
(20:08) makes sense if in 20 years from now they don't have a rape kit well what about the feminists saying well we should
(20:14) believe them now you see what I'm saying I think that if if it's a shorter statute of limitations people will have
(20:20) expected the the woman to get more of that evidence and to do more of that like if you have a shorter period to do
(20:27) that then you're more lik to gather that evidence within the like a reasonable time frame and get something that would
(20:34) help this and is this an unfair burden to place on you but I'd be curious if there is there actually like criminal or
(20:40) civil cases where it's like they did a really old rape accusation but because it's been so long these like evidentiary
(20:47) standards are lower or like the jury's way look at yeah just look at um what's his face uh judge Kavanaugh for instance
(20:54) I think that's like a really like clear example she didn't have any evidence she didn't know the house she could am I
(21:01) crazy did that go to court no I don't think so did that go to court that was just like I think testimony during his like whatever well went in front of
(21:07) Congress legal consequences for these people or like the court public opinion I'm saying in legal consequences I could
(21:13) be wrong almost it was almost a legal consequence to be
(21:21) not it's not it's not AI like you're not getting the Civil penalty of uh
(21:26) financial and you're not going ja like none of these stat limitations of office
(21:32) it is like it is a legal none of these statute limitations have anything to do with like Kavanagh before Congress
(21:38) question statute of limitations doesn't have to do with Kavanagh however it's just like it's the only example that
(21:43) came to my head of somebody being accused decades later and people having
(21:48) leniency for the accuser for not having any evidence for not having any
(21:55) knowledge of any of the people there for not having knowledge of where she was when it occurred so wait if he was if he
(22:02) was like fully believed like would then he not have made it to the Supreme Court presumably or like that would have been heavily weighted against him
(22:09) then um well it based off the people who were judging him the people judging him
(22:14) at the time so the people judging him didn't really maybe fully believe the test it's kind of that was a super
(22:21) partisan so I mean that why he got okay well so so due to their partisanship
(22:27) yeah they were to BR aside let's bring it back Kavanaugh is like very not
(22:32) related to this the most related one is like what was the name of the celebrity guy that just got eaten up the ex-
(22:38) Scientology dude or whatever oh it was uh Masterson yeah Masterson yeah that wasy but like the evidence for that was
(22:45) it seemed like it was fairly strong like that girl had reached out to several people right after it happened there were text message logs of everything
(22:51) like I totally different though but there are I know it's different but I'm just curious like something that would
(22:56) be really strong is like here's a guy especially a criminal conviction of rape on like no evidence just because it was
(23:01) like 30 years old like I just haven't heard that happening and you the way you talk about it it sounds like it's like a common problem but I don't know you
(23:07) proba I mean that's also because they just changed the statute of limitations with me too right so it's a newer so we
(23:14) don't have decades down the future to see true we don't have it you you made the CLA that like juries were treating
(23:20) it differently but now you're saying juries haven't had a chance to be in fronted with it yet which I feel like two different CL it to 30 years they're moving it most
(23:27) places are mov it from like three years to five six years which seems very reasonable to me that is reasonable I 30
(23:33) years I'm not seeing anywhere the most was that New York you pulled it was like 20 but most of the ones I'm seeing it's
(23:38) like they extended it to six years five years I would appreciate that like three
(23:44) three years seems way too short and if the me too movement did like it succeed
(23:50) in moving the statute from three years to five years and I would say the me too movement had some positive impact and I
(23:56) don't think that the me too movement was a 100% negative impact there were a lot of things that I really liked about the me too movement such as giving women
(24:03) hope especially a lot of women who thought they were alone in this situation and knowing that there's so many other women like them which is the
(24:09) whole point of the me too movement but my main issue is that it created a major
(24:15) issue a divide between the genders like we had never seen before uh issues within the workplace uh inability to
(24:24) like it highlighted before the AR yeah wasn't this argument that the Divide
(24:29) already existed it was just dramatically in favor of men yeah the me too was like encouraging people to come out like this behavior is happening uh but now we
(24:36) stand in like solidarity uh we're no longer afraid to come out and call out the horrendous
(24:42) Behavior I yeah that is one side of it to be I think that it's too it's too
(24:49) like it's swinging pendulum like I think there was the absolutely the issue that you guys are pointing out um and then I
(24:55) think the pendulum swung completely to to the opposite direction where we have people being accused of like just the
(25:02) minor these minor microaggressions are now considered you know sexual harassment when they're they're just not
(25:09) inen like are you because there's like a whole thing of like oh if you say hi to a woman now you could get you could get
(25:14) thrown in jail this isn't happening
(25:19) I where is that in other countries where is this you're saying these changes
(25:25) occurred so are you now seeing men and men es 30 years later being thrown in jail with no evidence I don't think it's
(25:32) necessarily thrown in jail but it's absolutely in the workplace the way that the men and women interact is absolutely
(25:38) different post me too movement and I think that it's what if it's better you just say different but
(25:44) different how you have any data say yeah you you have less you absolutely have
(25:51) less sexual harassment which is great like that's the goal um but then you
(25:56) also have a a really you have like a unfair
(26:02) dynamic in which women can hold something over a man in which men are uh
(26:08) fearful to they're walking on eggshells around women and I also think women are frequently excluded from male dominant
(26:16) areas and not as easily accepted for the fear of a potential me too
(26:24) situation are like in the corporate world you're saying or like yeah
(26:29) like you have't so you're telling me you've never heard a man say oh since the me too movement I don't want to work
(26:35) with a woman I would never hire a guy actually say never unless you're looking online I think it can happen but it's
(26:41) going to be way more subtle than that I don't think there's ever a guy like well since the me too like that's basically you're like screaming I'm a
(26:48) rapist I have literally heard people say it and even if people aren't saying it out loud as frequently even if they're
(26:54) more subtle it's it's definitely an underlying feeling that men within the workplace are
(26:59) feeling I was in the corporate world for like seven months as a practicing attorney and I still have my license but
(27:05) now I do only fans and I the things you would hear more are like men who would be like oh I really like your outfit and
(27:10) maybe would be like I hope that doesn't make you uncomfortable you know because they're afraid that it'll come off as and you see that but I don't see them
(27:17) excluding women not wanting to work with women I don't see that especially in
(27:22) among life in your past seven months of working like I understand saying like I
(27:28) I where are you seeing it who's telling you are you working in a corporate I have worked in I have absolutely worked
(27:34) in Corporate America before and I mean I've worked in law so since me too and
(27:40) you've noticed in your job in the in the corporate world that you're work I don't know what you do ab that men are not
(27:46) hanging out with women anymore and they're just I don't know maybe I've absolutely had conversations in the
(27:52) workplace with men where people feel like they're walking on eggshells where they feel less comfortable with their female counter Parts where they um maybe
(28:01) they're just annoying or maybe like not to sound like a s but like if I heard a guy say that like oh I feel like I'm
(28:07) walking on eggshells after me too I would just assume that guy is like a rapist that's the weirdest thing in the
(28:13) world that's an insane thing to say now I think there are more particular um worries so this is one wait wait why is
(28:20) that an insane thing to say because if you worried about being perceived as a rapist you probably have like a lot of behaviors or ways you engage with women
(28:27) that make come off as like a worrying about how you're perceived has nothing to do with the fact that you would it's not entailed that you would engage in
(28:33) Behavior because you're worried about being perceived I'm sorry but your perceptions absolutely entail the way that you act in reality there's no
(28:40) entailment whatsoever that if you're worried about being perceived as certain way that you are that's because you're
(28:45) going to act that way somehow I'm not surprised that you would be the one to argue against well give me an argument back I
(28:51) can't argue against you saying no against yeah against you're just saying [ __ ] I'm saying that in any other circumstance we we're applying different
(28:58) standards to rap here okay for for whatever [ __ ] reason but in any other circumstance if a guy were to like come into your house and he would just start
(29:04) talking like C like awesome with me but like I'm so worried because a lot of people think that I just like steal stuff from their
(29:10) house like if a guy randomly said that it be like what the [ __ ] do you mean why are people worry you steal ship from their house like I
(29:16) just toally reason I think it's totally reasonable for men to say that they walk around
(29:22) eggshells around women if they perceive that there's all sorts of false uh sex ual Dynamics at play FAL sexual claims
(29:30) that will be made against I don't think worrying about their how they're perceived is them
(29:37) saying Oh wait a second uh I'm actually wanting to do this behavior and now it'll just be perceived that I am I
(29:43) think that's a bad take okay but maybe not but for a man to have that a man
(29:49) who doesn't disrespect a woman's space in the first place and knows how to
(29:54) behave around women in a respectful manner wouldn't be afraid because he knows how he is acting in his uh work
(30:02) environment what usually something that happened for there to be consequences at least so when a guy says oh I just said
(30:09) hi to her and they've reported me to HR did that I don't think that's the you hang out with like the elderly
(30:15) generation ever and like have you ever noticed and it and it's just like part
(30:21) of their generation they tend to Bex they're just like they
(30:28) little cuty they're there's a little bit and then we look at them and we're like oh how inappropriate and how wrong and
(30:35) like yeah but we can't like that it's it's become such an
(30:40) extreme we can say some of May maybe we could recognize in society that some of the mannerisms that were tolerated
(30:47) decades ago shouldn't be tolerated anymore but it shouldn't go to such an extreme where we're penalizing people
(30:56) for basically flirting like I being
(31:01) penalized though is it just are they just are they being penalized or are do they feel like they're going to be
(31:07) penalized no people are being people are absolutely being penalized I I don't know why unjustly
(31:15) penalized I've met SE I've spoken to several men who I feel have been unjustly penalized for in what ways like
(31:24) a woman accused them a woman accused them of sexual harassment woman has accused them of rape a woman speak to
(31:29) the women did you get the other side of the story did you talk to the man well for the one of the cases like the case
(31:35) where the guy was uh accused of rape it was a UC case and it was overturned in his favor however he was already
(31:42) expelled from the school at that time even though they found that he that she had actually lied um and she was
(31:49) eventually expelled from the school as well but at that he played for uh their football team and because he was
(31:55) expelled he couldn't like go back on the football team there was no point for him to go so he lost everything he was like
(32:01) heading to the NFL he lost his he lost his ability to go to college are GNA be
(32:07) less likely than the other side the L that women who actually yeah I worked I
(32:13) worked in corpor I was an accountant for 17 years and there's so much sexual harassment in the workplace yeah so much
(32:20) so would you say it's still a net negative because a few men and and so we're seeing legally that statute of
(32:25) limitations being sent to 57 years is reasonable the workplace I don't know in what ways they're being actually
(32:30) penalized and their jobs are being affected and then in the school you're you're giving us a few cases where yeah
(32:36) I think you could argue the pendulum swing too much but in general if we're looking at the overall question of was it a net positive you're also saying
(32:42) yeah I also got rid of a bunch of sexual harassment and a bunch of women who couldn't um some benefits there are
(32:49) benefits but when I and it's hard I there are benefits to the me too however
(32:55) there are negatives to the me too and I think think if I look at the overall picture of me too I would say it's a net
(33:01) negative based off the way that men and women relate with each other I think men are scared to flirt with women I think
(33:07) it's made dating hold on wait real quick I just I don't I don't feel like men are
(33:12) scared to flirt with women I think that what's scary is if you're too autistic to realize if your like flirtatious
(33:18) advances are welcome or if they're inappropriate or not uh I think that those are the issues a lot of people are running into I agree with that older
(33:23) generation thing I don't know if it applies to anybody in this call or these two but like every single girl or woman that
(33:29) I've talked to that's worked in corporate any kind of corporate environment any kind of even engineering environment has stories about like the
(33:35) guy passing behind you that puts a hand on your lower back like all of these like really weird subtle gasy disgusting
(33:41) [ __ ] behaviors that and men can say and this is why I don't like this excuse men are confused men don't know what's wrong that's [ __ ] if I did that to
(33:48) [ __ ] myON he would kill me instantly men know exactly where the boundaries are okay they know exactly where the
(33:53) boundaries because we know when we engage with each other what's acceptable what's not acceptable reason women are like okay I don't like sounds S as [ __ ]
(34:00) but yeah are you are you not being flirted with anymore yeah but but it's very but it's heavy it's heavy risk
(34:05) would be another what would be risk is the problem so if we're looking at this objectively if you have men who have
(34:11) something to lose right it's very high risk for them under the pretense that there could be false allegations why
(34:17) take the risk if you can hire a man for the same position and there's no risk why wouldn't you do that that seems
(34:23) logical and reasonable to me and yet the employment trends don't reflect that in the United States well wait a second 45%
(34:29) of men ages 18 to 25 or 18 to 30 haven't even approached a girl this year in
(34:36) person so like that alone you think because of the
(34:43) me say find iric sorry I didn't mean to cut you off
(34:49) go do you find it ironic that Destiny you called these people autistic it's like yeah first of all we have a rise in
(34:56) autism and then on and that is compounding the difficulty in the dating relations like relationships between men
(35:02) and women and then you compounds that with this other issue of
(35:08) um of trying to figure out the Nuance between determining whether a girl is
(35:15) flirtatiously going oh no stop versus going no stop like versus whether or not yeah I'm sympathetic to these confusing
(35:22) right I'm sympathetic to these but like here this is a super easy answer and I would give this as personal advice somebody asked me if somebody came up to
(35:28) me and they're like listen up stepen I don't know of this girl blah blah blah blah blah here's what I would say if you don't know why the [ __ ] are you flirting
(35:34) at work you [ __ ] [ __ ] and I would call him a [ __ ] and I would slap him across the face if you have no idea if your advances are unwelcome or if you're
(35:41) being making somebody feel uncomfortable why would you risk permanently destroying your workplace environment that's like the worst where else you
(35:47) wouldn't you would stop hiring women and then that has not happened anywhere yet and it's not going well listen the
(35:54) employment trends that you're talking about it has happened there are surveys on this and many many men have said that
(35:59) they don't feel as comfortable hiring women as they did before and they're moving they have been moving away from that steadily especially in higher
(36:06) positions there is data to reflect that you're full of [ __ ] be
(36:11) curious are different actual employment numbers like you can get all the men to profess that they're not going to hire
(36:16) women but actually show me some employment statistics that shows a drop of like higher level management positions that there's for women what
(36:23) about the rape statistics those are all polls and surveys are those not valid um okay wait also
(36:30) another thing Lauren I agree that like meeting people in different areas is is important work is a good place to meet people but like I think you have to look
(36:36) at the other end of the equation too you can't just say well men don't know where to meet women except for work therefore like every woman's like Comfort at her
(36:43) job now has to be held C meet at work most people that kept married meet at
(36:50) work this idea that it doesn't happen is like stupid good thing I never said it doesn't happen because that would be
(36:55) actually yeah because actually like two seconds ago you were saying well if he wants to approach her at work he
(37:01) shouldn't be doing that or whatever the [ __ ] like no what I said was if you don't know if your advances are welcome
(37:06) or not don't jeopardize how would you know who would know that how would you know you don't know if you know then you
(37:12) don't know it's that simple hold on none of this is different from before me too as well by the way if you don't know your advancer welcome don't [ __ ] your
(37:18) workplace up with it I agree this and people still meet at workplaces it's not like are no longer I've link this over
(37:26) one in this is from Forbes almost one in five men or uh and about 6% of women
(37:31) report that as a result of me too they're less likely to hire attractive women this do great and also when you
(37:37) pull like 95% of women they say they want a guy that's over six feet tall people's preferences don't necessarily
(37:42) map on to real world Behavior reluctant but they're doing it yeah they're still doing it the thing the thing end day you
(37:48) go for competence and given education rates but the thing is is that that's not a good Trend and if that Trend
(37:55) continues there's and you you'll see this in other surveys which are reflected with Mentor status and all sorts of other things it's not really so
(38:02) much whether or not this phenomenon is going on in real time but whether or not the perception of it is going to
(38:08) continue to spiral in society and it seems like it's going to as all agree that that would bad thing yeah we all
(38:15) agree that that would be a bad thing nobody likes that Trend but it seems like when we talk about this the whole point of me too was to just punish poor
(38:21) guys and that's the only thing that's happened but the other side of the argument is maybe there's been a dramatic reduction in the way or
(38:27) dramatic change in the way that men associate with women at the workplace yeah there's a bad side to this too and that some people are a little bit more
(38:33) afraid of engaging with women but I mean as culture advances as people go on like people will learn how to do it different
(38:38) learn how to do it better as Lauren said earlier the older generation of men and women were creepy as [ __ ] and that's not
(38:43) the norm even in even for Gen xers and definitely not for Millennials and definitely not for Gen Zer when we aren't dealing with a
(38:50) massive labor shortage a nationwide labor shortage let's say in a few years we're not which is possible and and
(38:56) suddenly you do have the same qualified candidates who are coming in who are men and women and you have a lot to lose for
(39:04) your business or something like this doesn't understand a reason don't you think that a lot of those men would prefer to hire the man over the
(39:10) woman destroying Us in school and the workplace right now like women are on course to completely up end well they're
(39:16) not destroying us is so you see hang on you can see that
(39:22) especially with trades and with education the Gap is beginning to close and this is going to continue
(39:30) maybe it's reversed reversed it's literally reversed we didn't close it we reversed it now women are outperforming
(39:37) men in almost two to one in college even in med school there's more women I'm talking about college what was what did
(39:43) what was it that I said I said about the trades Andrew we're not here to talk about plumbers and electricians what I
(39:49) said was that the trends this Gap Trend could what I said was that the trends between the pay gap of Tradesmen and the
(39:56) educated is beginning to close up so no it doesn't really tell the whole story to say that women are getting more
(40:02) educated that's fine if a massive education was about rewarding the best and brightest almost nobody would be
(40:08) able to go to college but almost everybody is a college degree as people are finding out do notan does not mean
(40:15) that you're qualified for [ __ ] it doesn't mean you're qualified for [ __ ] anything and fast becoming
(40:21) something that is kind of um your nose has almost looked up at it because it it doesn't seem like matters if it's not
(40:27) about rewarding the best and the brightest then what end where are the numbers on the college
(40:33) degrees are being snubbed and people like no I want a high school graduate instead so if you're talking about like
(40:39) let's take a a field like sociology or no no let's not let's just talk broadly about statistics in the United States
(40:45) okay this is not happening what isn't happening that people are like oh I don't want the college degree guy I want
(40:50) the high school graduate no that's not what I said what I said was that the standard yeah the standard on College
(40:56) educations are that if more and more and more people have them they become actually less and less and less valuable
(41:02) because you appeal to the lowest common denominator you have to in order to get the most amount of people these degrees
(41:08) and so a consequence of that going forward likely is going to be that people will be less and less impressed
(41:15) with your degree and more and more impressed with your skill set and that's probably why you see the Gap in the trades with the degrees beginning to
(41:21) close on the o uh on the opposite side I mean even with higher education like I mean Lauren I didn't I didn't know you
(41:28) but I guess you're a lawyer too we're almost half of the profession now doctors we're women are are the are they
(41:35) are are law degrees less useful now or didn't we just say a huge employment yeah actually law degrees are
(41:41) significantly less I I get what you're saying but the fact that women it's not like our elsat scores are lower than
(41:47) men's we're getting into the same schools they are on Merit and it we're we're doing well yeah no you're you're
(41:55) right women are dominating the educational field um but that has I think that has a lot to do with how
(42:01) education is currently being ran and I think that's more specific and I think that's going to go into our next debate
(42:08) about why men are actually currently struggling with more oppression than women
(42:14) um yeah so I I I actually agree with you somewhat on that point that women are dominating the education field but I
(42:21) don't can I ask a question for everybody because I would like to know
(42:27) if if me toooo is so terrible what would be in your eyes what would be a good way
(42:34) to deal with the sexual harassment in the workplace it's not that it's so terrible it's just that for me better
(42:41) IDE than that yeah for me it wasn't that it was so terrible because when it first started there was so many things I
(42:48) actually really appreciated about it um like a lot of things like it really meant a lot to me but then it just it
(42:54) got out of hand and I think it ended ended up hurting our culture more than it ended up helping it even if it did
(43:00) have some successes such as uh more conversations about sexual assault
(43:05) changing some of our uh standards in the workplace and
(43:10) changing some of the statutes to three to six years those things are great however I think uh the way that men and
(43:16) women communicate with each other now are vastly it like has been strained I'm sorry the relationships between men and
(43:22) women has absolutely been strained from the me too movement and pretending like that's not true it seems quite silly to
(43:27) me um and there's and there's other things and I think that men being
(43:33) falsely accused of this horrible thing is at a all-time high and um I would I
(43:43) would rather have an hundred innocent people go free than one innocent man
(43:48) sorry 100 guilty people go free than one innocent man in jail and I feel like this is like in jail
(43:56) men rap because one man I'd rather have gu woman who's raped
(44:05) got damaged like for life as well or many many years probably her whole life
(44:11) I'm sorry are you guys for putting innocent people in jail like
(44:16) what you think is fair what okay let me ask a leg question the legal system is
(44:22) working if the legal system is working for every person who committed a crime
(44:28) who is not convicted how many innocent people should be locked up who which
(44:34) innocent person got locked up isn't it literally one but you would rather a hundred men go free versus I I would my
(44:40) point being is I don't want any innocent men in jail just evid question or but
(44:47) You' rather have but you're okay with having them go free that I would rather I don't want I
(44:55) would if you committed a horrible situation it's a horrible situation but
(45:01) why you just take it that's part of being a woman if she has to pick one of those she's gonna pick that one right so
(45:07) not saying super person she's just saying that's the one that she would pick if she had to pick between those two well and then also hold on just a questions for the United States for
(45:12) criminal conviction it's like I've heard I don't know what they teach you in law school is it 90 or 99% for Beyond Reasonable Doubt uh Beyond Reasonable
(45:20) Doubt yeah that's standard is it 90 like prance of evidence 51 no it's it's 90 it's like super like yeah so let's say
(45:26) let's say be [ __ ] up there's no number system to it there's no number that's why when you asked I was kind of like uh
(45:32) but preponderance of the evidence is over half I thought prance of evidence is basically over half and Beyond
(45:37) reasonance of the evidence is over half but I never knew beyond A Reasonable
(45:42) Doubt Beyond A Reasonable Doubt right that phrase that doesn't mean 100% it
(45:48) doesn't say only if you are completely sure so even baked into our Judicial System some people are going to be
(45:54) locked up that are innocent because Beyond a reason doubt could be satisfied by somebody that yeah so there's always
(45:59) going to be some amount of friction in a legal system where guilty people walk free and innocent people are put in jail
(46:05) but to say that even one innocent person going free um that's unacceptable so a 100 rapists can walk free because one
(46:11) innocent person might be convicted I don't even know if that's consistent with our understanding what I'm trying to say I'm trying to say it is M it is
(46:18) devastating to put an innocent person in jail it
(46:24) is not it we should just move on
(46:31) honestly rapist versus it's not a matter it's not a matter of number it's not
(46:37) saying that the hundred people will do XYZ it's literally saying that in America our our system is so good that
(46:45) when you have an innocent person go to jail that's a really really bad thing because to get them exonerated is
(46:51) probably not going to happen is really bad thing when a crime has been committed and the person yes sucks but
(46:57) do you think no but what do you think is worse having a jury convict somebody who's innocent into jail for the rest of
(47:05) their life or somebody who commits a crime wait wait wait wait you can't even answer that this telling you I'm telling
(47:12) you it's a moral thing yes no the moral thing you're absolutely dead [ __ ] wrong what's worse that you put an
(47:18) innocent man in jail or you let a guilty stereo killer walk free and kill five more people cuz that's five innocent lives destroyed inste the one innocent
(47:24) person going to jail you're whole hypothetical is completely [ __ ] absurd wait wait teaching them that you can keep doing this like oh my God this
(47:32) is like the trolley dilemma is what we're saying no it's not at
(47:38) allely no my God there's never a right thing is what I'm trying to say but
(47:52) most have just said let's go one time let's let Andrew Andrew hasn't talked in
(47:58) like [ __ ] five years so let's let I was just saying it does actually sound like the trolley cart dilemma so I think that the question is like would you
(48:05) throw the lever if one man innocent man went to prison in order to save 10 I think it is basically the trolley carart
(48:11) dilemma it's phrase differently but I think it is essentially the same thing that you're asking her uh so the answer
(48:17) to this question from you Destiny is what for the for this particular dilemma I think that our criminal standards of
(48:23) Beyond A Reasonable Doubt are adequate in the United States I think I like the way that our legal system functions but
(48:28) it's dishonest to ever use the phrase I don't want an innocent man to ever go to jail because if that's your position you
(48:34) are at ends with the current US legal system as criminal convictions work well I mean you don't you don't want innocent
(48:40) men to go to jail though no of course not but you also don't want to set the evidentiary standards so high that you
(48:45) only convict on 100% because that means a plethora of almost assuredly guilty
(48:51) people are now roaming the streets and committing more crimes and with rape in particular that's happened far more
(48:57) frequently than the other way around can you guys Define rape in this country
(49:02) please no exactly Bas so it doesn't exist or what the point of that question
(49:09) no no of course torch is probably right that's where we're going there no I'm not I'm not going to go through it all
(49:15) I'm honestly [ __ ] exhausted this conversation just keeps derailing three sentences how are you ex I'm bored cuz
(49:21) we're derailing into so many different things like it's not the reason the reason I've let it go is
(49:28) because I do actually feel this is on topic because an interesting it is an interesting philosophical discussion right like okay what is better in terms
(49:35) of outcomes is it better that a 100 guilty people walk or one innocent person goes to jail right I'm not going
(49:40) to give my answer because I'm the moderat but it is interesting discussion you think it factors in into the me too me too discussion which is why I allowed
(49:47) to go on for that long but if you guys want to like move on can I can I correct
(49:52) the Lauren if I'm maybe I'm mistaken but I I think what you meant to say was would you rather let one rapist walk
(49:59) through walk free or the one uh innocent man in jail
(50:06) no there's a common saying I'm surprised no one on no it is common that's common
(50:12) thing to say I'd rather have a hundred innocent or 100 guilty men go free than
(50:18) one innocent man in jail could com based off and it's based off why we have the
(50:23) American legal system set up the way it is yeah but she's still asking she's still asking the question the point
(50:30) noou why the American system is the way it is and Destiny's like well then you don't like the American no I like the
(50:36) American system it's set up specifically because we would rather have a hundred
(50:41) no but that's not true because if it was so then our standards for criminal conv then why are for criminal conviction so low they're nowhere near do you know how
(50:49) many cases prosecutors drop are you aware and like we a lot of rap cases
(50:55) wait what does that have to do with anything we let guilty like the current American legal system we probably let
(51:02) more than a 100 guilty that's not the question the question is in the current legal system without it being 100% no
(51:08) hold on you're bringing up things we all know that are pointless assertion like yeah there are obviously cases where they don't have enough evidence and they
(51:13) can't conict probably that's somebody like guilty we probably know that however right now in the United States you can't disagree with this you agree
(51:19) that the vast majority of convictions are done my point yeah Destiny no one disagree with you no no hold on the
(51:28) disagreement is Lauren what I'm saying what I'm saying is what I'm
(51:33) saying is yeah hold on what I'm saying is right now as it stands in the United States our system is set up to put one
(51:40) innocent person in jail for every 100 people convicted explicitly so probably less so probably less
(51:48) okay part of have Mone or not legal system is I
(51:53) want system I want to keep the American legal system with a really really really high
(51:59) standard of who we can stand can I ask a question Lauren how
(52:05) that CH yeah go ahead just to distill something are you for or against capital
(52:12) punishment um I'm on the fence on okay but you you know that innocent people have been yeah yeah yeah that's why I'm
(52:19) on the fence about that because yeah wouldn't you rather have uh
(52:24) how does that yeah that's a difficult circle square I understand that I want toir on
(52:32) the side of Inn but capital punishment I'm okay with executing a few fence with
(52:37) it and clearly off the fence and against wait a second wait a second that
(52:42) doesn't make any sense her position follows wait hang on guys one more time let's let Lauren finish we'll go to
(52:48) Andrew go ahead recently I have because of this specific issue where I'm not
(52:54) like I would have having one innocent person killed with is like destruction
(53:00) of our legal system in my mind so because of that reason I have been leaning away from capital punishment
(53:06) that being said there have been different so some states have different evidentiary requirements for if you're
(53:12) going to do Capital so like they have first the trial and then they have a second hearing afterwards to determine
(53:18) whether or not uh they should actually be you know killed uh versus you know
(53:26) jail for the rest of their lives and so I think that does help a little bit with like really really really ensuring the
(53:33) person is guilty but that still doesn't negate for the fact that you're going to have prosecutors committing Brady
(53:38) violations you're going to have corruption that's going to sway the system and so you're going to have innocent people on death row and I so
(53:45) that's it's a very tough according to your 2014 study the numbers about 4% 4% of people who got capital punishment who
(53:51) were uh turned out to be innocent D evidence yeah I know it's sh but
(53:57) anyway let's go to Andrew next yeah I was just saying no her position would actually be consistent Corey I don't
(54:03) understand why you said she couldn't hold it it's not a dual position she's saying she wants the evidence to be extremely high when it comes to these
(54:09) cases in court she would still want the evidence to be high in a capital punishment case she's aware that there's going to be some innocent people who are
(54:16) killed via Capital Punishment just like she's aware some innocent people will be locked up in prison but she still wants
(54:21) the evidence to be high there's no inconsistency there but there's also no disagreement we all do you have examples of it not being
(54:27) high now and people actually being thrown in jail or executed more so because of me too like I'm trying to put us back me to doesn't obviously affect
(54:35) Capital because me too is no I know but that's what that was I'm trying to put us back on track because you were saying
(54:41) that it's a net negative and that's because maybe even though we're putting a 100 R the capital punishment argument
(54:48) I'm not talking about capital punishment I'm saying that you're saying that it's a net negative okay because why why is
(54:55) I'm just trying to get us I gave so I gave my my points already I think it has harmed the relationship between men and
(55:01) women in many areas including dating including the workplace and also I think the workplace is one of the few areas
(55:08) left in which people even really hang out anymore we don't really have like soda shops we don't really have like
(55:15) places of meetings anymore other than the internet bars in work so it's very
(55:20) difficult this is all just your anecdotes that you feel my question was like what would be
(55:26) an alternative to me too to so that would be an alternative it's it's not that like I
(55:33) think that um people went into me too with bad intentions or that uh a lot of
(55:40) people that engaged in me too were doing the wrong thing so it's not like there's one thing that you could do and instead
(55:47) of the me too there's like an alternative option it's just that I think with the me too movement there
(55:53) have been a lot of negative repercussions that we didn't anticipate that came along with maybe some of the
(56:00) benefits including changing the statutes from three to six years I think that is a benefit changing it to 20 years I
(56:06) don't know if that's a benefit and so I just think overall the net negatives
(56:12) include the social interactions between men and women the uh easier to get men
(56:18) in trouble and at work at school and I think that definitely attempted to trickle into legislation I don't have
(56:24) any specific uh statutes in front of me that I could point to um and let's let's
(56:32) also let Andrew and torsa answer that question because an interesting question so basically I'll just repeat it what
(56:37) what should be the alternative against the me too Movement Like obviously you guys don't like that movement so what would be your alternative in the ideal
(56:43) world uh I don't have Solutions I just think there's some things that need to
(56:48) be fixed it's a multifaceted problem uh well it is it's a lot more new want then
(56:55) well what's a better idea I don't know probably starting with how to define rape because it's changed since the 70s
(57:02) uh probably getting statistics right I mean us was rated the most uh dangerous place
(57:11) for women because of the rape statistics I find that to be shocking in the US has
(57:16) the most dangerous R Rooter did which is and so no this is I swear to God and I
(57:22) heard actually a feminist talking about it they call her are you sure this isn't like of o or of the G7 or whatever like
(57:31) no here I can I took notes on it let me grab it uh [ __ ] what's her
(57:37) name in think we can all agree on the definition of rape rape is putting your P side of girl without her permission
(57:42) there go for rape um so the rape statistics though include things like
(57:48) intent did they try and stop that's included and that's absurd like they
(57:54) stopped they didn't rape it's my point yes this is and I don't know why like I didn't want to go oh that's a perfect
(58:01) example torche of how like the statutes have changed like think that's a perfect example of how it's the CDC and the way
(58:08) that we report it we have one group the uh justice Bureau or whatever who's
(58:16) the one and they're the ones that uh do like the actual criminal stuff like they
(58:22) have the evidence all that [ __ ] then you got the other ones who are just uh coming up with surveys and there was a
(58:28) lot of discrepancy in like 2013 about it and it hasn't changed about how they ask
(58:34) the questions and that there's a lot more false positives than there are positives aside from that uh pushing the
(58:42) me movement in my opinion uh like influences women to think that certain
(58:51) instances I don't want to say regret sex because it's kind of undermining other victims but I think when you have a big
(58:57) Collective group of people saying this is actually rape this is rape but none of it's following suit with the
(59:03) definitions it's problematic as [ __ ] because I know if men did the same thing people would be pissed they changed the
(59:10) definition of consent as well right so it was so they not only change in in the
(59:15) stat and that affects the statute so if you change the definition of rapen you change I'm a degenerate I don't know the
(59:23) statutes so what behavior is now considered rape and actually leading to legal consequences that weren't before
(59:29) that you think are unjust so I think that it's absolutely absurd that if a guy is going to uh have sex with a girl
(59:37) or something then she says no and he stops and that can be included in rape I
(59:43) think that's wrong changed what state I don't guys I don't know statutes I don't
(59:49) know I have an example so when I'm talking about statistics I'm talking about uh surveys or I'm talking about uh
(59:57) women who report to the police not necessarily charge the guy though because you don't have to that's guys
(1:00:03) also just a five minute warning for this topic before we move on to the next one so just want to give you guys that okay go ahead another example of the change
(1:00:09) of definition is like with consent so it used to be uh wait wait who's changing what are the statutes I think because
(1:00:15) you're just like saying these are so the where I saw this occur was like the UC campuses okay so this isn't a legal
(1:00:22) thing right this is just like scho trickle into legal things it trickle like they absolutely file cases the UC
(1:00:29) absolutely files cases on behalf and they start the case process based on whether or not it's gone through like
(1:00:35) the UC process so actual statute changed to include behavior that was not
(1:00:42) considered rape before that is considered rape now what where is nothing nothing has changed me to
(1:00:49) nothing has changed that's not true the con so like with consent so it used and I think and I I really wish I had like
(1:00:55) the statutes but certain places have changed so it used to be that consent was if um like you got some passive yes
(1:01:05) so like if you ask like like like you want to hook up or you show insinuation
(1:01:10) of trying to hook up and she appears to be [Applause]
(1:01:16) enjoying you need we've heard these we've all heard the stories before like consent change but if we're making a
(1:01:22) legal argument what if ARS Char police whatever be da would you
(1:01:31) guys to there's crial case here unless like an actual legal like statute or code or legislation important that wording is in
(1:01:38) statute so if that change I want to know the wording and I want to know how it was changed to change consent
(1:01:45) legally I I literally just explained how it the wording was changed so it was
(1:01:52) changed can I you don't have you don't have any example though I just said it was at universities and I believe
(1:01:59) certain State Statute yeah so I believe certain State statutes also have changed
(1:02:04) alongside the UC campus UC I know for sure for sure for sure but cool it's con
(1:02:10) even like doesn't affect
(1:02:17) men saying it doesn't affect men but you were saying California would have to change their statute for their I'm
(1:02:25) not she's saying that the schools are implementing things that can like uh get
(1:02:31) guys uh expelled and stuff so it's not I get it not
(1:02:38) ilal no no no no it's at their discretion because it's a private institution but I'm saying it's not a
(1:02:45) legal it's it's up to the schools the schools can expel if they think this is
(1:02:50) XYZ it doesn't have to be criminalized whatever the [ __ ] sorry guys real quick I want to also let uh uh sorry what's
(1:02:57) your name the girl in the middle Lana Lana okay I want to let uh Andrew answer Lana's question before we
(1:03:04) move on this doesn't like what would be an alternative to me
(1:03:09) too uh so I would try to move towards a patriarchal system where women were
(1:03:14) slowly phased out of the workplace altogether and then that solves this problem right how would we survive and
(1:03:20) live the same way that we survived and Liv for most of our history which is without women inside the work abandon
(1:03:28) their homes to go to other women what the first the first divorce case was because the the guy ditched his wife and
(1:03:34) his kids and went to be with another woman which has what to do with anything I'm a widow I mean like what would I
(1:03:40) what does it have to do with anything it has to do with everything survive how will they survive
(1:03:46) if the same way that they've always survived without women in the workforce there was not a problem with the survival before women were in the
(1:03:53) workforce post women are enabled to be in the workforce only through the usage
(1:03:58) of Technology if you look at wa no wait don't do this diet Tri answer the question how would a woman let's say a woman gets widowed how does she survive
(1:04:04) she would probably remarry the assets of the husband always have traditionally gone to the woman not
(1:04:10) only that there's usually an obligation from the family of the person you were widowed from who's going assuming the
(1:04:17) man was doing everything right like the man was just working hard saving money
(1:04:22) we can't assess all of societ just based what if RIS of what if a meteorite strikes you that's not fair
(1:04:29) and I'm sorry hang on let me finish Lady it's I'm sorry that a a [ __ ] meteorite might strike your husband and
(1:04:36) he might die but we're not going to make a societal prescription based on that that would be Insanity so yes there's
(1:04:42) going to be some unfairness baked in but we can't unfortunately alleviate all unfairness from every situation over all
(1:04:48) times we can't isn't it common right now that like the average savings rate is like negative for like people under 35
(1:04:54) so basically every Widow under the age of like 35 or 40 is just [ __ ] first of all they're not [ __ ] if you were to
(1:05:01) reduce the woman the uh women's participation in the workforce you would see a massive increase in salary more
(1:05:07) than likely for men that would Pro that follows in fact no it doesn't follow it
(1:05:13) that is it doesn't follow the number one indicator of like countries becoming prosperous and successful is women
(1:05:18) entering the workforce and starting to own businesses that's like one of the biggest indicators of it familiar you're familiar with supply
(1:05:25) and demand right if you have less workers do you have more of a supply of workers or less you understand that when
(1:05:31) you go to high school question like I just answered your no I'll answer your question the supply and demand X graph
(1:05:37) is an incredibly crude and simplistic way to analyze markets yes of course if you remove all the women from the
(1:05:42) workforce the men will get higher wages [ __ ] argue they wouldn't what why did
(1:05:47) you just argue they wouldn't because every single Economist in the world agrees with me and not you Andrew so maybe with you about what you just
(1:05:54) agreed with women start to own businesses enter the workforce you just agreed with me and my position that if
(1:06:00) all women were exited from the workforce tomorrow salaries for men would Skyrocket you literally just agreed L
(1:06:08) Dollar in our economy salaries might increase Andrew do you think murdering half the US population would be good for
(1:06:14) the economy because now you've got half what happens to the hang on so
(1:06:20) phasing phasing women out for one thing there's a massive distinction between that murdering half the population but
(1:06:25) assuming that we granted your hypothetical and half the population was somehow murdered salaries would still
(1:06:31) increase for the half that were here yes Destin not how it works there's no you
(1:06:36) just get them saying that's how it works that didn't get done saying you're using a high school supply demand graph to
(1:06:41) analyze an entire worker economy workers are a Supply in the economy generally an economy you increase your supplies you
(1:06:47) increase the standards of living you increase the GDP you increase wages across the board here's a question
(1:06:52) Andrew if we look you disagreed with me again no I didn't agree with Andrew I agree with you that the very crude
(1:06:59) Supply demand graph might seem to support what you're saying but there's a whole bunch of reasons why a crude supply and demand graft would never
(1:07:05) explain in something entirely like wage markets for an entire Society that's absurd you just listen you've agreed
(1:07:12) with me in every way you possibly can you just keep deferring to but there's other complexities which might come in
(1:07:18) okay fair enough there might be some other complexities that come in but men's salaries if women exited the
(1:07:23) Workforce tomorrow would increase drastically there's no way around that and then they would decrease yes your consumer base would fall your overall
(1:07:29) level of wealth would fall your overall like everything why would your consumer base fall entering the workforce has
(1:07:35) brought so much money to the economy when you compare it to like if women were never that those changes never
(1:07:41) happened so the economy has 100% been benefited by women entering the
(1:07:47) workforce wa wait it's this isn't even Up For Debate I'm sorry where are all of these I'm sorry answer this where are
(1:07:53) all of these hyper competitive countries that don't let women in the workforce because they want to be more competitive on the world stage can you name like one
(1:08:00) you mean uh Nations which are in the west they're all egalitarian and so they've all pushed for this
(1:08:07) however I'm answering your question you're not answering we can look at the markers before women entered in the workplace and we were very prosperous
(1:08:14) first of all no we're not number yes we were we were very Pros where is the where are the countries that are out
(1:08:20) competing everybody else cuz they're like we're not going to let our women enter the workforce cuz it's better for our country
(1:08:28) answer and then we'll go to go listen there's a distinction to be made here not no no you're rambling tell telling
(1:08:35) you the truth right now current in existence in the west no I couldn't point to one
(1:08:42) because of egalitarianism but I can still use the historic marker to show that those same Nations before women
(1:08:48) entered the workforce in Mass were quite prosperous sorry I think it's
(1:08:54) how did that not answer your question because he asked you for an example of a country today that exists today all
(1:09:00) Western nations were prosperous even before women entered the workforce you're giving me the argument that like
(1:09:06) women entering the workforce is like in like I don't know has made it so reality TV has appeared you're just correlating
(1:09:12) two things that aren't necessarily related to each other the way that you would study this in econ is you wouldn't go what was it like 500 years ago and
(1:09:18) now let's compare today you would compare one country to other countries and you would say you wouldn't you wouldn't look at the historic stand I
(1:09:24) think you would no you would never look no you don't look at that's why when you do any look at historic standards no no open the NBR open any Econ study ever
(1:09:31) you don't say like oh well 50 years ago what was it like let's see all this like first when you do minimum wage experiments you go state by state you
(1:09:36) pick Leo cities so when a kenian so when a kenian
(1:09:41) economist don't have the political Teran hang on stop stop stop whatever Economist you want but I'll just say
(1:09:47) kinan if a kenian economist goes in and to a government position and he wants to
(1:09:53) to offer economic Solutions wouldn't he appeal to kan's and Cane's markets and
(1:09:59) solutions and those those Market Solutions are going to be B standards for that what do you mean no you don't
(1:10:05) go up to a guy you go hey what about kanes hey what about the 1950s no no you okay economics of course you do I'll
(1:10:12) even grant you that but they would highlight examples of hey this country implemented Keynesian economics or
(1:10:17) economic policies and then this is how it played out as opposed to we don't use a historic standard remember Destiny
(1:10:23) just said don't ever look at a historic standard when it comes to the economy that is the dumbest single thing I have
(1:10:30) ever heard in my life by the way I have never heard anything that
(1:10:36) stupid in my life now I want to ask you Cory Cory do you do you think that it's
(1:10:42) unwise to look at historic standards when you're making Economic Policy Corey uh across the board University know
(1:10:48) there are some lessons to be learned from history uh but to Destiny's Point like making Economic Policy today
(1:10:54) generally speaking is driven by data generated today and looking at other policies yes but you're still looking at a historic standard and you're comparing
(1:11:00) the data that way you know which is good and which is bad policy can you give me an example of a
(1:11:06) major for the future Eon research that's looking back to the 1950s for modern-day
(1:11:11) insight into how we should be doing government policy oh yeah well that's done all the time of course oh then you
(1:11:16) should to name one time it's done well I can send over tons of data that goes over aund years economic policy
(1:11:24) kyian economics aan econom a policy that's not anything no no hang on the
(1:11:29) Kian kyian economics is our current policy Des you're [ __ ] oh God why am I getting baited by this I'm
(1:11:36) sorry economics is our like economics that's why we're
(1:11:42) gonna raise the r hang on I promise Lauren can talk L talk then we so okay
(1:11:49) Andrew I agree with you a lot in this debate however with Destiny's Point why for instance wouldn't China like force
(1:11:56) all of the women to stay at home and then have all of the men be in the workforce if truly that was what created
(1:12:04) the most prosperous one of the biggest problems right now is a labor shortage it's actually due to a lack of human
(1:12:11) beings labor shortage good because it increases wages Andre let me finish yeah tell us remember the supply demand no no
(1:12:18) it has not increased wages wages have essentially been stagnant there hasn't been much in of wage increases at all
(1:12:25) Destiny because of women and I because of women in the workforce
(1:12:30) actually workers um if you have more if you have more people in the workforce for hang on
(1:12:37) hang on yes Destiny wait a second and since to labor shortage that was basically the first time in my entire
(1:12:44) lifetime probably yours too where people could actually go in and begin to negotiate salaries because of this
(1:12:49) shortage yes Destiny you get it now destiny okay you Prov yes you proved
(1:12:55) your point so then answer Lauren's question why doesn't TR to say hey oh so what okay what was the answer you need to concede so concede on this China why
(1:13:02) doesn't China tell women first back up and concede to the point that I Wasing anything to you because so wages haven't
(1:13:09) been stagnant due to women in the workforce even though you just said that you that point again women in the workforce have increased the
(1:13:14) productivity and increased the real wages and increased every level of economic success every indicator in every country around the world that's
(1:13:19) why to Lauren's question why doesn't China tell women to stay home from work at this point there is again a worker
(1:13:26) shortage which is going on he's not the question he has no answer that is the answer there like a debate tactic literally no that how is that not an
(1:13:33) answer because I'm asking let me see if I can BR the app
(1:13:39) Andrew are you saying that the reason that uh China doesn't tell women to stay at home is because there's a labor shortage they don't have enough labor
(1:13:45) force for to to do that this is uh this is right now this is a global phenomenon
(1:13:50) this has to do with the fact that China had a one child policy and it's the same thing with our fertility rates here we
(1:13:56) can't keep up with the Supply right now we can't we just can't do it because you have the essentially the 18 to 30 year
(1:14:03) olds are going to subsidize the generation before and the four generations after and so you need this
(1:14:09) pool but we're now entering into this section where you have this pool which subsidizes all these Generations is so
(1:14:16) small that you have a huge labor shortage period across the
(1:14:22) board hang hang on hang on I'm going to bridge the gap I'll rephrase the question uh
(1:14:28) because I do see your point well what about if we take a country like India right they don't they have insane amounts of people being born why would
(1:14:35) they like following Destiny's logic why would they not just exclude logic thank you very much I mean India India's cast
(1:14:43) system does often exclude women and some of the Muslim nations often do exclude
(1:14:49) women so I don't know what you're talking about in this case we're talking about a western phen phenomenon we we
(1:14:54) have entered into a labor shortage because of
(1:15:00) I'm and by the way yes South Korea is completely westernized 100% do you
(1:15:05) disagree Destiny I don't know what your definition of westernized is uh they listen to every they're basically Us
(1:15:11) Port at this point I don't know what that means but okay okay they're basically I mean we
(1:15:17) run South Korea South Korea is a massive American Port our culture has definitely
(1:15:23) uh since the Korean War reframed South Korea it's basically it might as well just be like an extension of an American
(1:15:30) state at this point Andrew is right about that but let's let him answer the initial no I want Destiny to answer to
(1:15:35) this would you agree that that's true I'm not answering until you answer the China question you haven't answered it you're not going you just said you just
(1:15:40) made a claim you said what about South Korea south the West noing away I made this claim because you said only Western
(1:15:46) countries do this but countries around the world I was just giving you I'll ask question one time the audience can hear
(1:15:52) you evade it if you said that removing women from the workplace was good why doesn't China just order it to happen because it would be good for the country
(1:15:59) well like I said at the moment China is dealing with a problem which happened from their one child policy they're
(1:16:05) dealing with a labor shortage as well because this key demographic that they rely on all right how is this not an
(1:16:12) answering labor what he's answering the question
(1:16:18) no hold on he's not he's saying there's a labor shortage so they don't want to get women off of the workplace what do you think would happen the United States
(1:16:23) if we ask 50% of our Workforce when our unemployment is like three and a qu% didn't say that you should ask it tomorrow I had a plan to gradually phe
(1:16:31) women out so that women were more comfortable staying at home than in work and so this way we could try to get our
(1:16:37) population back up because well when you're when you moved off of year when you've moved off of day one supply and
(1:16:42) demand graphs go look up like the lump of Labor fallacy or literally any other type of reading you can do on Eon to
(1:16:47) show how stupid this point is what is the lump of Labor fallacy the idea there's like a fixed amount of work in the economy and if we have many people
(1:16:53) working we're gonna run out of work for everybody to do Andrew that's not true like I'm pretty sure there is there there's literally a a famous quote where
(1:16:59) it's like like 95% of stupid econ ideas uh start with this idea that there's a limited amount of goods and services
(1:17:05) forever available this not true one one minute warning this I've let this run way long because it's entertaining I'll give you guys another minute to duel it
(1:17:11) out and then we'll move on to the next topic anyway yes there's obviously an application to historical standards from
(1:17:17) Economist of course there would be why wouldn't there be even if they're just looking at data from five or 10 years ago that would still be them looking at
(1:17:24) historic data to make modern uh prescriptions for the economy not only that they often go back and look at
(1:17:30) different policies with different populations which worked and work off of that which is why legislative bodies
(1:17:35) often reintroduce policies that you know uh at one time were introduced and taken away for whatever reason because there's
(1:17:42) an EB and flow so I don't I don't I don't really even understand this as far as the labor
(1:17:48) shortage yes we had lockdowns people getting out of work plus China's one child policy here our fertility rate
(1:17:53) hasn't kept up we have a key demographic which we need to get up in the worst possible way it's pretty simple I would
(1:18:00) Des respond then we'll move on to the next topic I it's I don't even know how to I I don't
(1:18:06) know how to he's like he's not even wrong like that's how juvenile the understanding is like when you start to throw like Supply demand like crude
(1:18:12) graphs to try to explain like well this is how labor markets were it I mean like you've got I brought up the lump of
(1:18:18) Labor fallacy there's a broken window fallacy they did well if you break Windows now everybody's working you know repairing stuff um it's just it's not
(1:18:25) even based on like a bad understanding of econ it's just like a total lack of understanding of eon I don't know how to argue with somebody that legitimately is
(1:18:31) saying that if we remove all women from the workplace it's going to be good because there's going to be the supply
(1:18:37) of labor is going to go down so the demand for male jobs is going to go up without acknowledging the 50 million
(1:18:42) negative external knock on effects that that will cause that's why Andrew will never be able to answer the question of what are the successful countries that
(1:18:48) prohibit women from entering the workplace and that's why one of the key paths for every country to become economically prosperous is usually women
(1:18:55) entering the workforce that's like that's that's just been a trend of the entire world's let's move on to the next topic
(1:19:02) uh I want to give everyone like 30 seconds to just give their closing thoughts on this uh usually I give longer but we're running late on that
(1:19:08) one uh so for anyone who has any closing words let's start off with uky because we haven't heard from you in a while we'll just go in that order so 30
(1:19:14) seconds closing thoughts on this topic uh yeah overall I wasn't really swayed by the arguments I still think there are
(1:19:19) definitely some downsides to the me too movement uh but overall on the a good and that you know when I asked for like
(1:19:25) specific like policies that were implemented it seems like it just uh refer back to policies at University so
(1:19:30) nothing has really changed the world uh at large on the policy level uh so I don't think uh all the negative claims
(1:19:36) have just been OV exaggerated is that the economy Hang on we're just doing closing them
(1:19:42) torsa um I agree oh now it's loud uh I don't I wasn't really convinced on the
(1:19:49) other side though I still think in order to address this issue we have to get uh firm on statistics and really
(1:19:56) know where to pay attention I don't know okay Lauren thank you um yeah I think that a lot of really
(1:20:03) good points were made um especially about like on from the other side about the benefits of me too but um I and I
(1:20:11) think maybe I was not aware of some of the benefits that I was enlightened to today but that doesn't change my overall
(1:20:18) feeling that uh the overall effect of me
(1:20:23) too has been detrimental to the relationships between men and women in most spaces especially workplaces and
(1:20:29) school and um however yeah I'll I'll give a lot of
(1:20:35) credit to uh the my opponents for pointing out some good things such as
(1:20:40) like the change in statute of limitations to three all right cool Destiny and gang yeah I think we uh I
(1:20:47) think our team over here basically thinks that me too maybe has caused some more tension to the workplace Maybe
(1:20:52) maybe has led to some people being falsely accused so the false accusations have happened in the past um but it feels like people are too quick to look
(1:20:58) over like probably what has been a really large amount of good that's been done in terms of getting men to be more cognizant of being creepy or putting
(1:21:05) women in awkward positions of the workplace and holding some older figures accountable in ways that they might not have been had we not have this social
(1:21:10) push to be more aware of I guess rape and sexual assault in the first place yeah I just want to add a lot of the
(1:21:16) negative also was like speculative like oh well I this they're saying that they're more reluctant to hire women and
(1:21:21) that hasn't happened so all of the changes that have happened for the good in women less sexual harassment all of
(1:21:27) that versus oh there's this survey and maybe down the line it will actually
(1:21:32) have some real world effect even though right now it's the opposite that's not very convincing to me and I don't think
(1:21:38) anything was said that showed that in the legal world this anything was really happening in workplace you were just
(1:21:43) saying oh they just feel awkward didn't seem like real consequences were happening there and the only thing you
(1:21:48) were really focusing on when we would really push you was school and even then it was was like oh I know this one thing I know this one and to me the 100 to one
(1:21:56) and all of that was just not convincing okay cool let's go to Andrew and then we're going to move on to the next topic
(1:22:01) no I I actually agree with Corey I was completely and totally unconvinced by any of these women's
(1:22:06) arguments okay all right so anyway next topic is even me Andrew you I was confused why you guys
(1:22:13) were arguing because you guys are on the same team and you're making the same points Andrew we were on the same team and you still shout what do you mean
(1:22:20) same team I didn't
(1:22:27) you you guys were both you guys were both you guys both had the same position on this topic anyways okay so next topic
(1:22:32) is who is more pressed in America men or women and we can kick it off in any
(1:22:38) order uh what we started first with Andrew last time so let's start off first with uh let's start off with
(1:22:45) Lauren and we'll go in that order kind of like clockwise like this um I think
(1:22:50) that men currently have a more difficult time in society than women especially
(1:22:57) when it comes to laws in the books the main the main thing that I'm thinking of is parenting laws and I think of um
(1:23:06) that's the question sorry what was your question it is who's more I thought the mic was off
(1:23:12) I'm so sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you I I was just wondering the oppressed
(1:23:17) okay or did you say oppressed or oppressed who's more oppressed in America in America men or woman yeah
(1:23:24) yeah oppressed I think men are more oppressed uh you look at specifically
(1:23:29) for me it's child laws you look uh you could look at in abortion laws so if
(1:23:36) women I think the most important thing in life is your children that's always
(1:23:41) going to be the most important thing to anyone's life is their children and when it comes to the laws currently on the
(1:23:46) books it is unfair for men versus women and it's and that's why men are more
(1:23:52) oppressed than women I'm going to end there and we'll talk about it more right let's go next to Destiny and gang uh
(1:23:59) yeah I think I don't know at this point I don't know if I would say like I don't know if I say men are oppressed men definitely have problems but I don't know if there's like an oppressive Force
(1:24:05) working against them in society right now um yeah I think yeah I think I would say that so would you would your
(1:24:12) position be that women are more oppressed or would you say neither one of them is oppressed I like I think oppression shows itself in a lot of
(1:24:18) different ways I think there's probably some ways that women still feel it I think there's probably some ways that men feel it men do feel it it has
(1:24:23) absolutely nothing to do with divorce laws and Child Court though no um but that would be my position yeah so are
(1:24:29) you like I just want to flush out position so you're saying it's like kind of like it's equal or here's here's like
(1:24:34) the issue that I have right now okay I think this is a Peterson quote so maybe everybody will be happy with this if you're on the right um it feels like men
(1:24:41) Broad in the most broadest of sense men are like have this bimodal thing in society where men are leading everything
(1:24:47) they're like at the top of everything but then men also suck the most [ __ ] at the bottom of everything whereas women
(1:24:53) like happily occupy this kind of more stable centerr so when you look at like prisons it's probably like 96% men or
(1:24:59) when you look at like leadership positions like CEOs people in Congress is probably like 60 70 80 90% of that so
(1:25:04) like in that sense like well depending on where you look around men are doing really good or really bad and then women seem to just be gradually making these
(1:25:11) like really large macro improvements over time um but I don't know like do I say that like oppression is the reason
(1:25:16) why men go to jail or oppression is the reason why men don't get into school um I I don't know if I necessarily agree
(1:25:24) with that unless maybe you could argue about the affirmative action thing but that just got flipped in court so in the Supreme Court so yeah I'm not sure okay
(1:25:30) let's go to Andrew next yeah I think that um delaguna is
(1:25:36) essentially right here I would say that definitely men probably see more oppression and I think broadly we would
(1:25:43) probably agree on what we mean by oppression like kind of unjust push towards one group something similar to
(1:25:50) this we could flesh out the definition more if it's necessary but I don't think anybody would have a big problem with that yeah I would definitely say men I
(1:25:57) would say that men uh don't give a [ __ ] about other men and never have and probably never will I think the
(1:26:03) oppressors of men are men but I think the liberators of men are also men so I think it kind of stands to logical
(1:26:09) reason that yes men will essentially always be more oppressed in society uh in this particular case you have kind of
(1:26:15) the simp class of men uh who have now formulated through democracy how to team up with women and they kind of go after
(1:26:23) uh different class of men so it's almost hyper predatory at this point but I think it's um I think it's an
(1:26:28) interesting discussion I can't wait to have it okay Corey uh well I mean I Echo a lot of the
(1:26:34) same sentiments that Destiny just went through where there are totally uh issues specific to men as was sort of
(1:26:39) already alluded to uh there's definitely appears to be a higher education crisis among men uh I'm sure like male suicide will be brought up uh maybe at some
(1:26:45) point uh and a couple of other uh you know sort of largely men's issues uh but
(1:26:50) you know oppression uh yeah It's Tricky but let's just say I'm going by maybe just like political
(1:26:56) power and looking at maybe you know the US House of Representatives uh like yeah I think generally speaking on on the
(1:27:01) whole man hold more political power but it's yeah I give like the slight Edge to like generally speaking maybe winter
(1:27:08) slightly more oppressed but I can totally see the other side but that's where I stand now cool
(1:27:13) torsa um I just texted you I have to go but I would say probably both of them
(1:27:19) unfortunately I can't support that though but gota go right now my mom keeps coming in
(1:27:26) here so I'm gonna go help her and if you guys are still on then I can come back all right cool all right we'll see you
(1:27:32) later Toro uh all right yeah hang on hang on a second I got to take a leak I'll be back Jesus I got to Alex
(1:27:40) later hie Alex I gotta go uh okay can I just okay while I guess
(1:27:47) Andrew takes a piss you guys can just get into the open Panel par since we got through everyone anyway bye test friends
(1:27:52) too okay bye bye nice meeting you if you guys ever want to come on my show you're
(1:27:57) more than welcome and Lauren and Cory thank you a thank you so sweet moment
(1:28:05) okay anyway if you guys want to get into the uh because you got two people who are saying one thing and one person who's saying something different uh so
(1:28:12) let's uh why don't you guys kick it off yeah I have a question for Lauren so you were saying that in custody cases and
(1:28:18) stuff this is where you're seeing that men are oppressed can you explain that more yeah so like my issue for instance
(1:28:24) uh it's not necessarily custody so much for me is like the abortion issue so if
(1:28:29) you can if a woman so like I I believe abortion is murderer
(1:28:34) and so like if you you are killing your your man's child when you are getting an
(1:28:40) abortion and the man has no legal ability to prevent the woman that he
(1:28:47) impregnated from murdering his baby so he literally doesn't have any legal capacity over the ability to protect his
(1:28:55) own child's life uh while it's in the mother's womb and then furthermore
(1:29:01) people people have discussed balancing this out with um allowing men to like
(1:29:08) financially abort a baby so like if a woman doesn't want a baby she can abort it but if a man doesn't want a baby the
(1:29:15) woman could still have it and he would be financially responsible so there's no way for a man to get out of the
(1:29:22) consequences of impregnating someone but there is a way for a woman so I feel like that's just not fair um and
(1:29:30) furthermore as you know like just determining parental rights so like when you took Family Law class and you
(1:29:36) learned about the definition of a father it was so wild that was such an interesting concept for me because it's
(1:29:43) not just you're actually the DNA father legally right you could be the father in
(1:29:49) many states just because you either signed the first certificate because you thought you were the father or because
(1:29:55) you were married to the woman while she was pregnant and she gave birth and you held out to be the father for the first
(1:30:01) two years of the child's life and then you are legally obligated to financially support that child even if you're not
(1:30:06) biologically the child's father so that was my that these are just like specific
(1:30:12) instances that I think are extremely lifechanging and have affected many families that only seem to hurt the men
(1:30:20) uh can I clarify something because uh just to get your position clear you said abortion is murder so like in all
(1:30:25) circumstances no exceptions that's your position so including rapist is in rapists have the right to
(1:30:32) force uh in my opinion so like if you are raped as a woman I think that's
(1:30:39) obviously like one of the most horrendous things that could ever happen to you but what would be even more
(1:30:45) horrendous would be murder yeah but so can you answer my question so a rapist has the right to force the woman to
(1:30:50) carry the child to term no the government has the right okay okay sure yes okay can I ask a question I don't
(1:30:57) think any man has the right to force there's no state in which any man rapist or non- rapist has the right to force a
(1:31:04) woman to carry the child's term can I ask a question on this I'd be surprised this is true but legally I don't know
(1:31:09) are you telling me that if a man and a woman have a child and the father believes that child is his and they do a
(1:31:15) paternity test when they're 8 years old that there is like a ton of case law and everything that like the father if he
(1:31:21) decides to leave because it's not his child he's financially on the hook for that child
(1:31:26) whates what do you mean what cases aren't you a [ __ ] attorney there's entire stat you know graduate family law
(1:31:36) remember I do remember the paternity C like that unit in it but I'm trying to REM that's why I want you to remind me
(1:31:42) can you give me some names if this was such a big like we all have the this is literally the like certain that is their
(1:31:49) main stat what that's the entire state state like every case from that state is
(1:31:55) going to have that state law what you mean just look up the definition of paternity there are certain states where
(1:32:00) if you hold out for the first two years of the child's life that you are the father then you are financially considered a father and like no I'm not
(1:32:07) saying specific some of the funniest [ __ ] I've ever heard I don't believe
(1:32:12) lawo yeah wait wait hold on wait so I'm curious in your world then let's say that the let's say that the father does
(1:32:18) a paternity test and he's not the father and then let's say that the woman finds the real father can she Sue that guy and
(1:32:23) get child support from the father and have the normal father at the same no why is paternity only holdable by one
(1:32:30) person or yeah so like yeah so that would be only one person could be def definitionally the dad of the child you
(1:32:38) can't have like you could have like a stepfather you could have but there's only one father of a child and one
(1:32:45) mother of a child okay that sounds unbelievable to
(1:32:50) me but that I'd be interested that was unbelievable to me too that blew my mind
(1:32:55) inwo apparently like dozed off in that class when I say unbelievable I mean I don't believe you that's what I I'm
(1:33:01) curious this actually the C I guess I'll do more reading of this but no yeah it's crazy and and I think and I think a lot
(1:33:08) of those State statutes so those State statutes were written well before DNA testing like well before and I think it
(1:33:16) would be very easy to update those statutes so that for instance if you get
(1:33:21) an aest and you find out the kids's not yours um or but there's certain reasons
(1:33:26) why they have that law in place
(1:33:34) anyways okay moment of silence let's go to either Corey or Andrew uh well I mean I'm still sort of
(1:33:40) like processing uh and just to like really make it clear and like Hammer home the point like pretty much like no exceptions whatsoever like rap and
(1:33:47) ancestor on the board it's not an abortion to be I think the murder we're are getting a little off
(1:33:52) topic like with abortion more about uh I mean it does relate somewhat but uh yeah
(1:33:57) let's try to bring it back a little bit more that was like an entire month of
(1:34:03) law school so I'm just like mind blown right now I know I know T25 got into t14s I'm not an idiot
(1:34:10) but I remember the paternity unit but honestly I didn't pay attention super
(1:34:15) hard in family but I I'm trying to remember because I do have this was five
(1:34:21) years ago for me I'm like a porn star now this isn't what I do but I'm trying to that's why I'm trying to be like okay
(1:34:27) let me look into this what cases because a lot of especially family law a lot of those were based on cases so I'm like
(1:34:33) cases I remember I remember stories so I'm like give me the story and I can look back and see what I remember that's
(1:34:39) what I was saying yeah but you know from family law like that was the one class that was that wasn't my family law
(1:34:45) professor really he was great it's not even about your professor it's about the type of class is is this definitely
(1:34:52) wasn't on the U bar exam I can tell you that oh my God this is definitely I
(1:34:58) literally took the uve bar and pass this was a question family law
(1:35:04) was yeah it was so yeah but this was a question on the uve this could potentially could have
(1:35:10) been a question on the UB no because again if I pass the bar
(1:35:17) pass the uve I know there's a family law on the bar but this I
(1:35:23) what I passed the bar this year in two states in Arizona and in Florida what
(1:35:28) Arizona is a ubbe and Florida's not yes but so and you saw this question on your
(1:35:34) bar exam one of the two no no no I remember this from La school because I paid attention in class yeah so I mean I
(1:35:40) I got to the same place you did I guess I just didn't need to study as hard but my question for you is was this on the
(1:35:46) UB bar it could have been it could have been a question on the exam now not
(1:35:52) everything that could be a question on the exam makes it onto the exam but it's absolutely testable
(1:35:59) material and you were taught it not through cases you were taught it through what like I'm just curious all guys I'm
(1:36:06) enjoying this lawyer cight but let's bring back a bit this is like [ __ ] like I think it's boring most of the
(1:36:11) chat uh let's bring it back to the initial I think here's how we can kick off this discussion a bit more maybe uh each person can spec uh point out
(1:36:18) specifics in which case uh they the gender they're talking about as oppressed so Corey for example if we
(1:36:23) start with you uh maybe you can point out some specifics ways in which women are oppressed uh well I would take the
(1:36:30) opposite side uh I guess in this specific case of like the overturning of roia weight I see as somewhat oppressive
(1:36:37) uh to a uh and I would just uh sort of in my opening statement uh sort of somewhat lack of potentially political
(1:36:43) power uh at you know the United States House repres Representative where I think it's only like a qual women uh so I just think there's just an overall
(1:36:49) lack of representation uh now this is the result of Oppression uh arguably not
(1:36:55) potentially uh but that's more or less the lens that I view it through of like just overall lack of political power uh
(1:37:00) that might be uh resulting in oppression so yeah it may not be oppression
(1:37:06) specifically I'm confused is it oppression or is it not oppression uh well I guess it's nuanced is a lack of
(1:37:13) political power oppression uh given the fact that you have largely you know men that are making the laws and legislation
(1:37:19) uh is that oppressive arguably not or arguably it is okay well I mean that's
(1:37:25) what he's trying to clarify though are you making the claim that that yes I would lean towards the fact that given the fact that pretty much at a political
(1:37:31) level in terms of political power uh that is largely men that are making legislation and passing legislation uh
(1:37:37) across the board then I would say that's lean towards being oppressive but they aren't these men voted in by women uh
(1:37:44) yeah they are then how is that a but well so it could also just be the fact that uh due to certain Maybe social
(1:37:51) environmental and maybe biological factors who knows that uh women do not run for office and there's but so I will
(1:37:57) grant you that over time representation of women in United States of Representatives has increased over time
(1:38:03) uh I'm not saying it has to be exactly uh 50% uh but yeah until we actually get
(1:38:09) closer to that uh I think there's AR made that there's a some level of Oppression but women are voting but but
(1:38:15) hang on hang on but women are voting them in yeah they're voting of selected candidates okay that run okay uh and
(1:38:23) from what I understand it could be wrong but it's largely men that are running uh of the candidates that just as in like
(1:38:29) uh look at the pre uh presidential candidates etc etc so do you think that so hang on so do you think that it's
(1:38:35) oppression then if uh in a district it's mostly white people who run for office
(1:38:42) and mostly black people who vote for them are you saying that they're oppressed because they're not you don't think they're adequately represented uh
(1:38:48) at some level yes because then the question is why so then the representation must always be one for
(1:38:54) one you can't represent him any way I I didn't say that I didn't say that the United States House Representative has to be exactly 5050 uh I I still think uh
(1:39:02) an underrepresentation might be a sign of Oppression this why I'm not I'm not planting my flag of absolutely there is
(1:39:07) an oppression I think I've been pretty clear uh that I can see like both sides and I brought okay so you're wait let me
(1:39:13) just kind of clarify and I'm trying to avoid like actually getting involved in debate but also the same time like
(1:39:18) moving things forward so you're saying Corey that you don't have a firm position on this you're saying you could
(1:39:23) see both sides of the argument is that correct yeah uh as of right now like I said I lean towards on average across
(1:39:31) the board uh women being slightly more oppressed but I'm not like I'm open to having my position change totally okay
(1:39:37) oppression just just to be clear oppression is like an unjust system right so for example if it turned out that the reason there's less women in
(1:39:44) Congress is because less woman run for office then there would not be oppression but if it turns out that there's some kind of system that's
(1:39:50) keeping them from getting that where that then that would be op press so just I think it's support make that
(1:39:55) clarification so that that is totally fair that so it just begs the question of like so then it is it is a valid
(1:40:00) question to ask of like well why are there not enough women candidates and the question is why is that the result
(1:40:06) of Oppression I think that's an open question enough women candidates maybe women don't want to be politicians as
(1:40:13) frequently as men men want to be politician the whole point he brought up yes I said it might be environmental
(1:40:19) social biolog I don't know that's why I said the why okay ignoring that point going back to your whole
(1:40:26) argument it kind of relates back to Destiny's opening argument there needs to be an
(1:40:31) oppressor well well what it's just leftover from
(1:40:36) how it was it's just left over from them being repressed before it's loosening up
(1:40:42) now so that's why women are you know coming into the government and political
(1:40:47) sphere but they are so yeah like let's say hypothetically so like the feminist argument would be patriarchy oppressed
(1:40:52) women and that's why they aren't in school and now that we've lessened up in the patriarchy women are participating in school more and somebody might say
(1:40:58) well why aren't men in school and you go to oh well patriarchy has kept men out of school because men still have the masculine expectation to be the sole
(1:41:04) providers of households so for instance during the coid time period more men dropped out of school than women did I believe to pay for their households so
(1:41:12) you could so people could argue that there's still oppression it just it was against the women and now it's kind of against the men but like at the end of
(1:41:17) the day like quantifying all of this gets really really difficult I think yeah also just to be clear we're not
(1:41:23) like talking about what people think we're talking about what each one of you individually think I I I do agree it's
(1:41:29) kind of harder like oh is it 40% men and 30% women but just like we're talking about more so like is it slightly more
(1:41:35) that men are being impressed slightly more than women being oppressed by the system so yeah just to clarify so I feel it so depends on like the lifestyle you
(1:41:42) live and the circles that you run in like if you've got like friends on only fans who make a [ __ ] ton of money for being women and being hot then you might
(1:41:48) be like oh women have it way [ __ ] easier than me I work at McDonald's my life sucks but like if you run in certain circles where it's like if
(1:41:54) you're an engineer and you work at a certain firm and like 95% of your Workforce are men and the 5% are like Secretary of women or whatever then you
(1:42:00) might feel like oh men are doing like way better than women so I feel like to some extent this might be really localized I'm not sure if you yeah I I
(1:42:08) understand what you're saying okay it's hard to say like on a broad level like even the thing that Lauren brought up was really interesting saying that men
(1:42:14) kind of get [ __ ] over in the abortion process because women get to choose when to abort the baby which is true but it's
(1:42:21) resting on probably one of the most unfair biological facts and that's that every single child born in society has
(1:42:27) to be carried by a woman and that is like a lifelong process of having periods and giving birth and all of that
(1:42:32) that's an unfair thing that will never be remedied as much as trans people might want that to be remedy that will always be a burden for women to care so
(1:42:38) like is it is it unfair that men can't have Financial abortions I mean like it kind of is but is it unfair that women's
(1:42:44) like half their bodies are preparing constantly to get impregnated that's also super unfair and that will never change so it's just it's hard to one is
(1:42:51) a difference is like we're recognizing biology and bi biological differences between men and women and so there's
(1:42:57) going to be some things that suck for women that they have to go through biologically and there's certain things that suck for men that they have to go
(1:43:03) through biologically that women don't have to well the problem with this argument though is that that's not true
(1:43:09) men ultimately do have a choice on whether to get somebody pregnant it's called protection wom certain things
(1:43:15) that there's certain things biologically that men go through that women don't have to there's certain things that
(1:43:20) women bad like what so is it unfair that men are
(1:43:25) stronger than women kidney stones like get kidney ston puberty sounds pretty
(1:43:31) terrible your ball is way not like women don't go through my
(1:43:39) balls didn't drop actually they're still up in there so go through
(1:43:44) that actually I'm confused biological woman my point being there's
(1:43:50) certain things that are biological that we can't change and then there are certain things that are man-made such as the law such as statutes and the when
(1:43:57) you look at so constitutionally we're we're required to treat every human equal uh if you're going to discriminate
(1:44:03) based off the there's you can discriminate based off race and gender racist strict scrutiny gender is
(1:44:09) intermediate scrutiny it's lesser because it there are actual distinct differences between men and women so
(1:44:15) they have to write the laws differently but we should attempt to make the playing field as even as possible possible for men and women when it comes
(1:44:22) to the man-made things not obviously we can't change biology but we could at least try to legally make everything so
(1:44:29) didn't you say like there's strict scrutiny for race and now there's intermittent scrutiny for gender based on biological reality so aren't the
(1:44:35) abortion laws also representative of a biological reality that I think they're doing a poor job the abortion laws are
(1:44:42) doing a poor job of equaling the playing field so they could do a better job by allowing men to have Financial abortions
(1:44:49) or by making abortion is illegal I mean as you know like child support is not
(1:44:55) gender specific so in the in the event that if a woman gave birth and then decided actually I don't want the child
(1:45:00) I want to give it up for the adoption but the father said no I want to keep the child then the woman has to pay child support to so once the baby is out
(1:45:07) of the woman's body everything legally is exactly the same yeah but that doesn't really answer to her uh kind of
(1:45:13) initial opening which is to say that right now you have massive or at least
(1:45:18) some cases of paternity fraud which are going on no you don't Flink it you have to Source it we're a massive case of
(1:45:25) paternity fraud sour massive I literally said sum so okay you
(1:45:30) said M and then you change some okay so some meaning what 20% or 1% Andrew I'm
(1:45:35) not sure how many but regardless regardless of how many she is making the point and I think that it's around 10% I
(1:45:43) would have to double check or between 4.5 and 10 I think something right in there no 10% of children are fr
(1:45:50) frul born that's an insane number if that number out of the ones where
(1:45:55) praternity was talking about the same numbers you're talking about you're talking about out anyway but what she's
(1:46:02) but what she's alluding to is she's saying that there's something which is also unfair here which is how is it that
(1:46:08) men could get straddled down with having to support children which aren't biologically there after it's been
(1:46:14) demonstrated via DNA that they aren't that seems like it's fundamentally I understand what you're saying but I
(1:46:20) don't think that that's the case I think Lauren kind of misrepresented that so there are way something Destiny it's
(1:46:27) a link it's about like Apparently one in I don't know how and I just I thought it was one in N up but people are saying
(1:46:34) one this this article that I found and I haven't reviewed it says one and three the chances are how how many children
(1:46:41) are genetic offsprings of someone other than the guy who they think is Father you have read or heard or watch anything on this question you will have
(1:46:47) encountered many estimates from nine to more than 30% a that almost one in three people
(1:46:54) might I I was just looking this you're right but there's a clear very important caveat these are out of the PE out of
(1:47:01) the situations with the guy specifically challenges disting
(1:47:06) it those it turns out that one out of three of them all right so it
(1:47:12) is think still pretty high but I am curious about the ones whoas now you're
(1:47:19) looking yeah the selection bi is literally people that think that they don't have fraternity right this particular study
(1:47:27) but then I would just because we don't have the data on people who aren't questioning we don't have the data on
(1:47:33) people who aren't questioning no no but we they call these they call they call these extra part hold on green shirt
(1:47:40) what are you Jasmine you're saying we do how do we have that data so if you're saying that it's only one out of three
(1:47:45) of people who are actually questioning that's what I'm saying what are you saying I'm saying on this study it's
(1:47:52) people who are questioning one out of three it's not the kid right so do you
(1:47:57) have the data for fathers who are not questioned right no I'm saying we have the data if we look at all the babies
(1:48:03) being born what percentage are then found to be we would be able to have that I could look it up so that's it's
(1:48:10) literally that's part of the outline that I made Andrew wipe the Tucker Carlson look off your Jesus yeah that
(1:48:15) was part of the research that I did for the uh they called them extra partner pairings in the literature that I
(1:48:22) DNA Mi Hospital numbers come out to anywhere
(1:48:29) from 0.5 to I think the highest Outlet was 2.3% that's what I mean
(1:48:35) because 2.3 you don't think two out of a hundred dads
(1:48:41) having think I can actually wait wait hang on hang on let me jump in real quick because I I've been looking this up and there's actually some statistics
(1:48:47) so the problem is that most of the studies were done 1991 to 1999 but if we go off those it actually heavily heavily
(1:48:53) depends on the country so it is out of we're talking about like out of total it's 11.8% in Mexico but in France it's
(1:49:00) like 2.8% and UK is like 1.4 to 1.6% Switzerland is like 8% so it seems like
(1:49:07) it also really really heavily depends on the country I don't know what's going on in Mexico but a lot of people raising B
(1:49:13) are not them so yeah but it's around there in Western count seem to be around 2 3% seems like in Mexico it's just like
(1:49:19) yeah and then also just quick thing this was brought up earlier this was brought up earlier about paternity for children if you have
(1:49:26) a child with somebody and then you take a DNA test and it's not your child you can disestablish paternity um just
(1:49:32) looking up on the Florida law the things that will prevent you from doing this are if you like made other promises
(1:49:38) after knowing that you weren't the biological father so I'm just saying on some random legal site like if you allow
(1:49:44) the mother to put the name on the birth certificate when you know you aren't the father if you promised in writing to support the child if you signed in
(1:49:50) acknowledgement of paternity or if you married the mother after you knew the child wasn't yours and you assume parental and child support obligation so
(1:49:55) you can you can divest from a child if you take a biological test like this is not my and as you know that's why you learn this stuff through cases so I was
(1:50:02) like looking okay what were the facts what did the court say it wasn't just like oh no you know that's why I wanted to know but is the Florida law
(1:50:09) representation of the standard in other states well it's not Andrew I welcome you to show me a state where different their own laws every state especially
(1:50:16) when it comes to this sort of like family law I it is kind
(1:50:21) honestly cases from States you know that we didn't read a lot of I fin my sentence I was going to give you some
(1:50:27) credit here girl I was gonna give you some credit about how it would make it it did seem silly to me when I was
(1:50:34) taking the bar that to be studying for family law for uve test anyways where
(1:50:40) every state is different and we're supposed to know like the basic generals of all I always thought that was stupid
(1:50:46) for the particular reason that every state is different so yeah I I was I understand why you forgot that family
(1:50:52) law was on the test no I didn't forget family law was on the test I looked but I don't know did you take barbery like
(1:50:57) Bary didn't spend a lot of time on this question because they didn't I i' would love to see your like case Mater like
(1:51:03) the material family law this was not at all
(1:51:08) that's why I was like what's the case but you know okay right like I'm thinking family
(1:51:15) law in regarding the babym case like there's things that you just remember because they were such big parts of
(1:51:20) family law maybe I was skipping class I just and I I didn't see it as a huge part of the bar exam because those are
(1:51:27) the things that stayed in my head the most and this wasn't one of them so I I that's why I'm like what percentage of barbery did you do what do you mean what
(1:51:34) percentage of barbery like 30 still that makes sense family law was in like the
(1:51:39) last 20% of barbery so I mean I moved around I did the critical pass flash cards I did all the things I I know how
(1:51:46) to study efficiently and not just do the whole [ __ ] and still pass that's why if something wasn't a big thing on my mind
(1:51:53) that means it wasn't highly tested family law I looked okay what are the things that I need to know for family law and I don't remember being like this
(1:51:59) is a huge part of family law so that's why I'm like okay give me the cases so I can see because there's probably some caveats in there that make it because if
(1:52:05) I heard something like that I would probably be like as astonished as you that's why I want to see the cases and the nuances see where cases came out
(1:52:12) differently what facts were analogous what facts need to be distinguished that's what I'm looking for and that's why I'm like thinking of big cases in
(1:52:18) family LW and I'm thinking if you none of them have to do with this as I ask you but we can move on from this that's all I'm saying
(1:52:26) okay let's let Andrew talk we haven't heard from him in a minute yeah I I don't really know where
(1:52:33) we're going with this honestly I don't know where we're going with it you haven't said anything either Desy
(1:52:40) you don't know where we're going with it either where we going with going wait did you bring up Rolo no yeah in your
(1:52:47) chat gossiping I think it's cute how you guys like gossip hang bring up Rolo no I just brought up Rolo yeah you
(1:52:53) just brought up Rolo so then the question stands did you [ __ ] Lauren
(1:52:59) Southern hey you brought it up no he didn't he did he brought up had to bring
(1:53:05) up did not bring that up what the what is your obsession with Lauren oh everything's everything's an obsession
(1:53:12) she Li you real being married obsessed with Lauren
(1:53:17) Southern know she's right about attention as Lauren Southern's vagina gets it's just wild do you know she lied
(1:53:24) about being married she lied about being married she's on your side in the conservative movement this and and
(1:53:30) probably hump that little Gremlin and you don't [ __ ] care about that at all we don't even need to worry about it no
(1:53:35) big dealin it's [ __ ] crazy to me like oh we're just just let it go don't even
(1:53:42) worry about it no problem and it triggers men like it's so wild she's oh
(1:53:48) my God if she were ugly like that's okay I'm sorry never mind it would still be a
(1:53:53) scandal if this chick is lying about her you guys wouldn't care and you guys would accepted her more and you would
(1:53:58) have brought making [ __ ] up I don't give a [ __ ] what the chick looks like ugly girls in the red pill movement don't
(1:54:04) [ __ ] care what she looks like that's not the Scandal the Scandal is not what Lauren Southern looks like gives a [ __ ]
(1:54:09) it obviously is because all of you men keep talking about her [ __ ] Non-Stop and accusing talk about her [ __ ] what are you talking about southern has
(1:54:16) [ __ ] Destiny has [ __ ] myin has [ __ ] um who else did Rolo say that she
(1:54:23) [ __ ] like oh uh Hunter Avalon um who else why am
(1:54:29) I Lauren Southern's [ __ ] everybody now it's just so why are we talking and even
(1:54:34) if she has [ __ ] everybody who the [ __ ] cares why do he care if you misrepresent
(1:54:41) that you're married for an elongated period of time she did not only did she
(1:54:46) but she admitted to it made an elongated video about how she did what are you talking about even care about her
(1:54:51) personal life because because she's supposed to be a conservative a Trad conservative woman on my side of the
(1:54:57) aisle and if she misrepresented her own marriage lied about it and at the same time was humping a leftist you know
(1:55:04) cheating helping with I think that that's fair game for us to ask about conservatives can't [ __ ] Le wait Andrew
(1:55:11) I have a question for Andrew would would it be would it be original press secretary was be married to the guy in
(1:55:18) charge of the Lincoln project sorry hang hold that thought for one second Lauren I just want to explore
(1:55:24) this would it be like I don't know if you said that last ver a joke but would it be like less bad if it was a conservative that she [ __ ] or does the
(1:55:30) part that Lial it worse no well if she was misrepresenting herself as being married while she was humping anybody it
(1:55:36) would be bad I don't give a [ __ ] that Destiny's cing Destiny's a cumer but I don't care
(1:55:42) what he does it's never been about the cumer it's always been about the fact that she is making he's talking about
(1:55:48) hypocrisy he's not saying if she wasn't married I think he wouldn't care I don't know if he would or would not but I
(1:55:53) think he's arguing against the hypocrisy of Lauren not so much like her sex life is that correct yeah that's irrelevant
(1:56:00) to it it's that she's misrepresenting herself on the tradcon side it it's not
(1:56:05) hypocritical to have an opinion and post that opinion and then live your life and
(1:56:12) then maybe not have all of your morals 100% acted out in your life you
(1:56:19) could have morals and not follow them 100% of that time it doesn't make you a hypocrite it makes you a human it makes
(1:56:25) you not a perfect person everybody is human and then to be digging into her personal lives accusing her of like
(1:56:32) getting pregnant and having an abortion and doing all that no you didn't but Rolo did which I don't care what R does
(1:56:40) Rolo okay whatever this whole [ __ ] [ __ ] is just driving me up a [ __ ] wall
(1:56:47) I you you know you know what would solve this this she could just answer the question then we'd all know who cares
(1:56:53) who we care because she's misrepresenting herself like why do you not understand this cares what she does
(1:56:59) with her vag we care because because if you're a tra woman who's grifting and pretending that you're hus you're
(1:57:05) [ __ ] mared yes she did not only did she she made a video showing that she
(1:57:11) did literally made a video about it she is living her life to the best of her
(1:57:16) ability with a weding ring on misrepresenting her herself as married on the tradcon side and you're just like
(1:57:23) there's nothing to see here these aren't the trits you're looking for why don't we give any other God so we don't do this to men at all so like for instance
(1:57:30) sneo you I guess women are more oppressed then Lauren
(1:57:35) don't just in the red pill space we are yeah be fair is being
(1:57:42) called women that's why none of the conservative women followed any of the conservative men into these [ __ ] spaces that's why people like Andrew and
(1:57:47) R are so asmad about people like Lauren and Britney is they expected all the conservative women to follow them into the actual degeneracy that is red bell
(1:57:54) yeah so obviously the conservative men are super mad and I don't have anything to do with a red and all of your time gossiping now about like oh come on your
(1:58:01) entire show's about gossip bro first of all my entire show is not about gossip I just came back Congress talking to Rono
(1:58:07) what have you been doing the P I know what you were doing actually you were on a stream with Rolo talking about me and Lauren because somebody told him to me
(1:58:12) right after my [ __ ] interview with a Sit how you gonna say that bro you bro
(1:58:19) most of your you put your public life you can't put your public life on display and then pretend it's not fair
(1:58:26) game to talk about it D had two barass attorneys arguing some legal Manner and then when it was your turn when it was
(1:58:32) the man's turn to talk you gossiped you know you you brought it up I didn't I
(1:58:37) brought up Lauren Southern no you brought up Rolo for some reason so I so I went ahead and asked the question
(1:58:43) because he's in chat in your chat talking right now was hisers he wasn't even he wasn't talking to me I'm sorry
(1:58:49) it's Lauren in my chat talking am I missing her messages what does have do with the price I'm not not the other
(1:58:54) Lauren the one that I had the abortion with multiple abortions and secret children I guess yeah I never kused you with
(1:58:59) that anyway Alex was this relevant yeah I I enjoyed it because it was funny you
(1:59:06) guys got hat it but yeah it's absolutely not relevant uh what Destiny does with his dick let's uh let's read right back
(1:59:11) to the initial topic but seems like you guys are kind of like uh I don't know like do you guys have anything more to add on this feels like you guys it's
(1:59:17) really hard to quantify like on if anybody is like going to come out the door swinging like men have it harder women have it harder I think it's kind
(1:59:23) of dishonest like we we all have our own struggles right now and I think women have done caught up or surpassed men in
(1:59:29) a lot of ways uh so to to sit here and say that like women have it you know
(1:59:34) harder than men when I I it probably wasn't part of the legal analysis but like you look at affirmative action and women are destroying men in school now
(1:59:40) like that was probably a part of the rational that was probably part of like at least the American public's feeling on it so yeah I feel like having a hard
(1:59:45) answer one way or another is kind of silly okay yeah just to also so since we're kind of wrapping up I'll go back to the the thing that you guys were
(1:59:52) discussing I had some thoughts on which is uh the hypothetical that Lauren laid
(1:59:57) out about like one innocent man versus 100 guilty men no it wasn't even a hypothetical that was just like as an
(2:00:02) expression it was a saying it's highlight The Genius of the American legal system I I don't even want to go
(2:00:09) into that further so then okay so then the question I would ask to everyone is what do you think like a ballpark or
(2:00:14) what that ratio should be should be one for one like obviously that's a good question like obviously like there's
(2:00:21) like if you go really hard in the legal system right you make it really really [ __ ] aggressive there's going to be some innocent people get caught up with
(2:00:26) it if you go very loose right you're going to be there's going to be less innocent people get caught up in it but there's gonna be a lot more people walking what do you think like ideally
(2:00:33) obviously it's zero innocent people but that's not practical from P like from a practical perspective what do you think
(2:00:39) that ratio roughly should be just anyone could
(2:00:45) start uh right now my int like I obviously just coming up with an answer on the Fly uh I think probably and maybe
(2:00:54) it might depend on the nature of the crime uh but maybe on like the order of like uh one in a thousand I can even see
(2:01:00) like one in 10,000 like I spelled barbery wrong there's no e at the end um one guilt so for every so you rather
(2:01:07) have um one uh guilty well sorry one innocent person going to jail yeah as
(2:01:14) long as like a thousand or 10,000 are being convicted okay oh like wait oh so
(2:01:20) yours is flipped right or am I am I losing you uh yeah yeah yeah sure mine
(2:01:26) is like reversed okay gotcha yeah also I think like the one thing that none of you guys brought up is just how much
(2:01:32) money affects how good of an outcome you have in the legal system it really comes down to like a huge amount of is how
(2:01:37) much money you have and if you have a lot of money you'll have a much much better outcome in the legal system than if you're poor it's like not even close
(2:01:44) uh okay let's go to Lauren next it's very difficult for me to quantify ify it in a
(2:01:50) number um I would say more I would say more than 100 obviously
(2:01:58) um quantifying in a number is extremely difficult for me it is very hard yeah
(2:02:03) yeah extremely difficult I almost want to say more than a thousand um which is probably where it
(2:02:10) is at legitimately so yeah I'm just going to stick with more than a thousand actually it's definitely not at a
(2:02:16) thousand if you just go off like the um is it not do you not think it is I think
(2:02:21) it is for every crime committed you think first of all I think most crimes don't even go reported like first of all
(2:02:28) you have to find them out then you have to report it and then you have to decide to prosecute it if there's enough we
(2:02:35) talking are we talking like traffic infractions or like trespassing because like kids running through backyard I'm not talking about M I'm talking about
(2:02:41) like like felonies and [ __ ] like that like if we just go off the death um what what's it called the death penalty uh
(2:02:47) innocent people statistic 4% of people according to a study done you're asking how many crimes don't get caught no no
(2:02:54) not I don't know if that's what she's asking but uh for every like every hundred people who commit a crime I'd
(2:03:02) rather hundred guilty men go free than one innocent man be put in jail but you
(2:03:09) would want to loosen up the aggressiveness of the legal system right so like I would make it I would want to
(2:03:15) make it as difficult as possible to put someone in prison that being said I
(2:03:21) would I would like to prosecute more like more cases I I feel like we are
(2:03:29) like for instance in Boston recently uh they highlighted 15 statutes that
(2:03:35) they're just not going to prosecute anymore and a lot of prosecutorial discretion is being used especially in
(2:03:41) liberal states to um to not pro like I don't want that I do want crimes to be
(2:03:47) prosecuted but I do want want it to be much more difficult to get a conviction what kind of how would you change like
(2:03:54) what would you change because you're talking about changing the fundament like the pillar of our legal system which is our evidentiary burden how
(2:04:01) would you change that to make it more difficult to put people away is that what you're saying like you have to be
(2:04:06) super so that you don't risk putting an innocent man away that's what you're trying to say right there are ways to change that can make the penalty for
(2:04:14) prosecutor or misconduct like [ __ ] 20 years in jail that would that would be one way for example penalty can getting
(2:04:19) like disbarred I mean depending on the type of misconduct right no I know but I'm just saying like there are ways to do what Lauren is saying I'm not saying
(2:04:25) that what she's arguing for is good or bad but there are ways to do that like again like one of them is like uh prosecu misconduct 25 years in jail
(2:04:32) guarantee that will move things move the bar in One Direction is prosecutorial misconduct
(2:04:38) even that big of a thing for like people getting yes it happens pretty often unfortunately wait can you when you say
(2:04:45) pretty often wait what does that mean uh I don't have the exact statistic I can look it up but it's I'm just curious
(2:04:50) when you say pretty often you're like in half of cases and like 1% of cases no it's probably it's more than 5% less
(2:04:56) than 30% probably okay because that's a pretty if like 25% of one in four cases
(2:05:02) has like significant prosecut prosecutorial misconduct that demands like review or not I I can pull up real
(2:05:09) quick uh I just I've just heard uh yeah so 30% actually report Val as child
(2:05:17) welfare workers yeah so 30 % uh this is not just prosecutors oh yeah prosecutors
(2:05:23) is 30% Law Enforcement Officers 35% forensic scientists 3% good for them and
(2:05:28) child welfare workers 2% wa wait is this like when they're charged or when they're accused or you're saying in 30%
(2:05:34) of all criminal trials yeah the prosecutor is doing something that's uh unethical or illegal or is doing
(2:05:40) something Shady basically that violations and [ __ ] I can legit I know
(2:05:46) that's a huge number I know it's actually uh that's actually harder than it's uh larger than I thought but yeah
(2:05:53) sure I'll just share my screen so are you talking about where Pro prosecutorial misconduct was a factor in
(2:05:59) overturning something because I'm seeing that for that where if something is overturned a lot in 30% of those cases
(2:06:06) prosecutorial misconduct was the reason that's different than in 30% of cases in general I'm looking at what you're try
(2:06:13) yeah I'm just trying to read what you're saying but it's saying deliberately conting exoneration so it sounds like
(2:06:19) the% that's not in all cases that's out of exonerations where okay fair enough yeah it did seem a little high to me but
(2:06:26) still it's kind of up there I mean I I would to research well that's because
(2:06:31) that's because cases could only get overturned Force like very select
(2:06:36) specific reasons and one of them is prosecutorial that's true but that doesn't also prove that then it's 30% of
(2:06:42) general in general I didn't say that I didn't say that but he's saying 30% seems pretty high and I'm saying saying
(2:06:48) well no because it's one of like only three options so it's not that high I know but he meant 30% of high with the
(2:06:55) original was Am I Wrong it did seem kind of high to me uh
(2:07:00) but it's also kind of hard because unless the case goes to like uh gets like appe peal like how would they even
(2:07:06) know there's prosecutor misconduct it's like a chicken and egg type of problem well I most the court process is like
(2:07:12) pretty open source right like Discovery evidence is made available all the Motions can be seen by both sides like
(2:07:18) who's going to like unless the defense appeals the case and like pushes it further like who's GNA who's going to
(2:07:24) see that well like what hold on what are you not seeing what do you mean like if there's a case and there's some prosecutor
(2:07:30) misconduct and you have I'm like what kind of misconduct would you not see
(2:07:36) uh withholding evidence I mean it could be any number of things this is probably something Lauren is g to be better able
(2:07:42) to answer the me because I'm not like Brady violation is essentially withholding evidence yeah so that would be one thing and you're saying that this
(2:07:49) is happening a lot and it's just not being caught but where's your evidence for
(2:07:54) that she's laughing at you because it's a hard to prove because you're basically asking for it would be like saying what
(2:07:59) are the number of unreported I want know where they're getting this because they said you learned about this in law school I understand but that's what I
(2:08:05) mean people are just conflicting 30% look at it and it's 30% of it like you said exonerated cases so
(2:08:12) what percentage of cases do you think are actually cases not overt like people cases being overturned are actually
(2:08:20) there's prosecu misconduct happening and where are you getting that number that's what I want to know
(2:08:25) so feeling it's probably between my mind to to feeling is probably between five and like 15 or
(2:08:31) 20% uh I would okay here's a question for the two lawyers so withholding
(2:08:36) especially exculpatory evidence that sounds like some [ __ ] that can get you completely [ __ ] do you
(2:08:42) think yeah is that not or yeah it's it's a bad thing you could uh many attorneys
(2:08:48) are still capable of practicing after but you can you can be disbarred I think
(2:08:54) can you be criminally prosecuted I don't know if you could be criminally prosecuted but you could absolutely then
(2:08:59) question then so what do you think is the percentage that's my question yeah what do you think the percentage of like Brady act violations or withholding like
(2:09:05) exculpatory evidence or whatever that you think prosecutors are engaged with yeah and then yeah so I want to know
(2:09:11) where you're getting what percentage and also you're depending on the Brody violation the uh and like your intent
(2:09:19) and the egregiousness of it the violations are very very different sometimes the case just goes on and and
(2:09:24) you or and sometimes the Brady violation isn't even significant enough to overturn the case even if they're aware
(2:09:30) of the Brady violation and they show it so so like let's say you're convicted of a crime and then you later prove that
(2:09:36) there was a Brady violation but that Brady violation like let's say they has to have substantially like I know what
(2:09:42) you mean it has to have affected the case enough for that to be a reason to overturn it for sure but I'm asking you
(2:09:47) what percentage cases even and that's for a good reason if it's a little tiny thing that wouldn't have even changed
(2:09:53) that's what the courts are looking at would this have actually changed the outcome of the case if the answer is no then the case should the outcome
(2:09:59) shouldn't be changed well hon if you know that the prosecutors holding
(2:10:05) something back and they're like um okay that wouldn't have been enough to overturn the case but it was relevant
(2:10:11) and therefore it's a Brady violation and you only caught one of those I feel like if you like if they're you see smoke
(2:10:19) there's fire if you so like it that's of the time is this happening
(2:10:24) that's my question to you how I don't know that's one of those things I can I can give you a little bit more of a
(2:10:29) number that and I never pretended to give you a stat on that so don't throw your hands up in like a disgruntled well
(2:10:37) I think on well I think the frustration is that because earlier when this number was provided the number was high enough
(2:10:42) that in my opinion it undermines our entire legal system if I think that one out of three prosecutors are committing sever ethical violations by withholding
(2:10:49) culpatory evidence that's like what what we have like a Banana Republic at that point but if it's like 1% are engaged in
(2:10:55) Brady violations where sometimes somebody [ __ ] up or there's some evidence that they should have brought up or they should have presented their side but they didn't think it was
(2:11:01) relevant and it was that's a severely different thing so yeah that's my do you think it's significantly higher than 1%
(2:11:06) up to 30% I don't think so I don't think 30% did seem kind of high to me I was just going off that statistic but yeah
(2:11:13) you're right I mean like affect the outcome
(2:11:18) that no no because if a prosecutor is doing something uh intentionally that's either legal or unethical that's a
(2:11:25) problem in of itself it regardless of whether that would affect the case or not right and there are consequences for that okay but
(2:11:33) here's question really quick though I the reason that I don't think judges so with PR you know in the Appellate level
(2:11:41) you're only going to overturn a case even if there's a Brady violation if it wasn't enough to sway the case then
(2:11:46) they're not going to appeal the case I disagree with that I don't think that's the way the law should be even though
(2:11:53) that's the way it is because I feel like if the prosecutors are withholding some
(2:11:58) evidence that we find we don't know what we don't know we don't know what
(2:12:03) evidence the prosecutor withheld and was never exposed so some smoke so if you
(2:12:10) see some smoke there's probably a fire and so to encourage prosecutors to never
(2:12:16) commit Brady violations they should make it so that if there's any Brady violation then the case should be
(2:12:23) appealed in my opinion and that would encourage prosecutors to be giving all
(2:12:29) of the all of the evidence over immed as much evidence over as
(2:12:38) possible what the judge is looking at the judge is looking at what was usually withheld and yeah you can't go into the
(2:12:44) mind and see everything but it's not that every time there's a Brady violation we have no idea what they did
(2:12:50) hang on hang on hang on so first of all I think that it should be much more than like the the case gets appealed like if
(2:12:55) you if the prosecutor does something intentionally illegal they should go to jail or they should get punished but here's a really interesting thing that I
(2:13:02) found so uh this is a surve that was conducted and basically they looked at five diverse States over uh fiveyear
(2:13:10) period 2004 2008 uh and identified 660 cases which cord found prosecutors
(2:13:17) committed to miscon conduct such as tampering with key evidence withholding evidence from the defendant or coursing witness to give false testimony now
(2:13:23) here's the really interesting part of the 660 cases examined only one prosecutor accused of misconduct was
(2:13:29) disciplined so it seems like the vast majority of them actually get away with it what was the what was the numbers that you said of the 600 cases how many
(2:13:36) admitted on the survey said they did misconduct of the it looked it identified didn't look at how many cases
(2:13:42) they looked at they just said they looked at five states over a 5year period and they identified 660 cases and
(2:13:48) out of those 660 cases only one prosecutor that was accused was actually disciplined disciplined at all so they
(2:13:54) so the rest weren't even sanction nothing well it sounds like they weren't discovered is what he's saying saying they weren't discovered okay wait were
(2:14:02) the violations discovered and the attorney still not reprimanded that it doesn't
(2:14:09) say that I don't think I I think Lauren you know that we would be reprimanded for
(2:14:16) that honestly I don't know because I think a lot I don't know if that's
(2:14:23) actually if you actually would be we get [ __ ] for everything if we file a frivolous suit everything you're saying
(2:14:30) suit yeah you can you you can get sanctions
(2:14:37) for filing frivolous suits but that's usually if you filed multiple frivolous suits and the court wants to because a
(2:14:43) lot of times the judge's discretion that's correct but you're saying it sounds like well it sounds like for here what could happen is like thetically
(2:14:49) there might have been some text message that maybe the prosecution discovers or some line of text that they discover
(2:14:54) they're like this isn't relevant and it turns out that like maybe the defense would have liked that but it's not a big deal so like in this case the judge
(2:15:00) isn't going to be like I'm coming down in your hardore they whatever that's exact that are looking at because we
(2:15:06) don't want every single thing to go back and that is a perfect example that is a
(2:15:11) perfect example that Destiny just gave because the the as a prosecutor you
(2:15:17) shouldn't be determining whether or not you think it's good for the defense or not you just need to determine whether
(2:15:23) there's any relevance at all and hand it over and not to do that if you were to
(2:15:29) change the law so that if there were Brady violations whatsoever then prosecutors would be more encouraged to
(2:15:36) turn over literally any evidence that they have including that text message that might appear irrelevant at the time
(2:15:43) especially if they were to get sanction or or we should start sanctioning like do mandatory sanctions for attorneys who
(2:15:49) don't turn over evidence I'm notat sanctions for for but the thing is
(2:15:55) as you know there's so much little stuff that comes in with this that if you're all over what like how hard you've okay
(2:16:03) you've worked hold hold she expl okay what she's trying to say is that that for if you're a prosecutor you should
(2:16:08) just turn over everything that you should don't ask a question if you do any type of research anything that all of it should be turned over to the
(2:16:13) defense and she's saying that if you make the uh the punishments sufficiently high enough for ethical violations related to Brady whatever the [ __ ] that
(2:16:20) if you make it high enough then prosecutors will just turn over everything instead of them trying to decide what's appropriate to turn over or not because she doesn't want a
(2:16:25) prosecutor making a decision for the defense about what evidence might be relevant to them AR to do that anyway not that I I mean not that I'm
(2:16:32) aware of because I know there's different in different states like I know for instance in Arizona you do have to turn in more than just what would be
(2:16:39) relevant or look bad for the I'm in Miami with you chica what I'm not I don't live in Miami
(2:16:46) I'm just visiting you're in Miami right now yeah but I don't live here okay but I don't did I miss what
(2:16:53) you said yeah but I don't live in Arizona so you just okay yeah but that was giving you an example of like that
(2:17:00) there are different rules and a lot of times if I remember correctly Arizona is an example of a state where you don't
(2:17:08) just have to turn in um your evidence that you think will negatively impact the other side because some some states
(2:17:13) that is the the standard some states you actually do have to put forth all your evidence anyway and I do agree if you
(2:17:20) don't do that it's wrong but I don't necessarily think that a bunch of cases I think it's good that the judge is
(2:17:26) looking at okay how relevant was this would this have changed the outcome of the case if it wouldn't have changed the
(2:17:32) outcome of the case I'm just saying maybe it's not a good idea to completely bring here bring I understand where
(2:17:38) you're coming from here's here's and I do get I genuinely hold on what Lauren is saying
(2:17:45) is that like Lauren agrees with you that it might bad to do that the same way that we probably like we shouldn't
(2:17:51) overturn a case just because the evidence was gotten in a bad way right you could say we know this but we wouldn't say that we would say well no
(2:17:57) the principle of doing the process from the very start is so important that we will throw out those cases so she's saying that the penalty should be so
(2:18:03) high that we're just going to throw out all Brady violations because we want people to be acting the best manner possible even if we know some people
(2:18:09) might be guilty we would still do that in a court of law like for instance of a c PS you over doesn't read your man he doesn't mirandize you he doesn't do whatever right that's the argument yes
(2:18:15) okay okay I I don't necessarily disagree with that but I don't think that there there's like in a like a mass problem of
(2:18:22) lawyers just getting away with this and getting no like for instance remember in um was
(2:18:27) it Massachusetts where they had the attorney uh gosh I'm forgetting it was
(2:18:33) with the drug I want I don't want one case I want you to show me that this is like a widespread this was like a serious issue the McD the dogall case
(2:18:40) where the where the woman Civ Pro I'm trying to remember it was a Civ Pro case you're talking about D
(2:18:49) responsibilities it would be an Evidence case it's a newer case so it's probably not going to be in your textbooks I
(2:18:55) graduated in possibly would have gone over it with you it's essentially uh this woman she worked in the evidentiary
(2:19:03) like the chemical she was supposed to be testing the drugs for the prosecution and like determining oh this is cocaine
(2:19:09) it's this amount and yeah and that's used for the prosecution and that that
(2:19:14) relied upon in court she was actually snorting most of the drugs and then just like signing forms saying what was did
(2:19:23) she did she not get in trouble is that what you're saying or I an attorney who like used her [ __ ] for years and then
(2:19:32) didn't want all of her cases overturned figured out that she had been doing that
(2:19:37) and then didn't tell the defense about all of the issues and then like one one more minute on this before we wrap up so
(2:19:44) one more minute of warning and kept trying to Adit so they kept trying to change the time period of
(2:19:49) how long oh she was only snorting coke for like the last three months and then you find out oh no the prosecutors knew
(2:19:55) that she had been snorting coke for like a year and a half so all of their cases for a year and a half involving any of
(2:20:02) the drug evidence that she had been on all of those cases are essentially should be overturned but the prosecutors
(2:20:09) withheld that and that prosecutor what was like for this came out of it because if you read
(2:20:15) it that means that something was the black letter law that came out of the case give me the Quimby rundown of this case not don't just tell me the facts
(2:20:22) yeah because it sounds like everything you're saying is wrong and we agree it's wrong and another my issue I'm not gonna give you
(2:20:29) the Iraq for this but the is the issue that I had was this
(2:20:35) that she didn't receive sufficient sanctions you remember what sanctions she received I don't remember what
(2:20:41) sanction I just remember hang she was able to keep
(2:20:46) herney license that's what keep it we really went deep into this lawyer
(2:20:54) talk uh I think that we just found zerker next girlfriend but anyway let's do final closings uh just this happened
(2:21:03) in Massachusetts yeah she sounds like she got disbarred she was disbarred for
(2:21:08) violating thousands of criminal defendants due process rights by failing disclos key evidence related to government chemistry stole drugs from a
(2:21:13) State Crime I was like what is the why did you read this case in class because you know we read every for a reason it's because we're trying to get the black
(2:21:19) letter LW and the reasoning of why we you know you're in law school so don't just tell me the facts I'm notw grad the
(2:21:25) facts are so bad I agree the facts are really bad and she was it looks like she was disbarred well I think she should
(2:21:32) probably be much more than disbarred but anyway I do want to wrap and I don't even think and I wonder
(2:21:37) when she was later I don't think it okay let's we just you can in your
(2:21:45) closing statements you can literally like talk about anything whatever it is that you that's on your mind in terms of
(2:21:51) this whole discussion uh and then I just want to get through some super chats and they we're done uh let's start off with
(2:21:56) you Andrew since we haven't heard from you in like a few years and then we'll just keep going uh clockwise yeah my

(2:22:20) learned a lot about the United States legal system that I didn't know before which I appreciate uh and I guess to
(2:22:26) quickly close up the actual topic like yeah it's hard and it's Nuance uh but I think slightly on the whole women are
(2:22:32) more oppressed maybe like 51% or 50.1% but I can see it either way uh but yeah
(2:22:38) again super grateful to be here and to be invited uh you can find me on Twitch twitch. cor Cam4 I'm a biochemist I
