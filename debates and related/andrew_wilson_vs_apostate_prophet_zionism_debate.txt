(2:45) AP Terrible terrible beginning Yeah
(2:50) [Laughter] we'll kick it over to AP The floor is all yours We got the timer set Thank you
(2:56) so much uh James Thanks to Uncensored America and thanks to uh Andrew for organizing this Andrew is a newcomer to
(3:02) debates Many people don't know him Uh he might be a little bit nervous today Uh before I start um I want to point out
(3:09) that there is a QR code over there It might also appear on the screen So uh I'm not going to go with a presentation
(3:14) but I have a onepage landing site there where uh everyone can follow the evidence and everything that I'm going
(3:21) to talk about today So I'm going to argue for the position that Christians should absolutely support Zionism In
(3:27) order to have a proper debate about this topic we feel we need to establish first what Zionism is Over the last years lots
(3:34) of people have began talking about Zionism often in uh very wrong ways They
(3:40) have given wrong descriptions Especially when Christianity comes into the equation lots of people misunderstand what Zionism is about They think that it
(3:47) is about um some end time prophecy often influenced by certain Protestant uh
(3:53) teachings But uh it might come as a surprise to many people But when I say Zionism we are simply talking about the
(4:01) establishment and the protection of a land a country a state where Jews can
(4:06) live freely a Jewish state in what is now known as Israel At some point in history this was known
(4:12) as uh Palestine or Palestina named by the Romans in order to suppress Jewish
(4:18) identity Uh today the Arabs living in the region have adopted or rather appropriated this name for themselves
(4:25) But that's all it is Zionism simply stands for establishing and protecting a land a state for the Jewish people I
(4:32) want to make one thing very clear which is that I am not a Christian Zionist I'm not a religious Zionist I am a Christian
(4:39) today who also happens to support Zionism because I care about the
(4:45) continued existence of the Jewish people in the land That's what I support being an
(4:50) anti-Zionist would by definition be to be against the existence of this state
(4:56) to be against the existence of a state for Jews and would also conclude in the annihilation the
(5:04) extermination the destruction of the Jewish people in the land and this is not just a fallacy this is not
(5:10) propaganda this is the truth destroying such a state would immediately very
(5:16) quickly lead to the destruction of the Jewish people living there We don't have to speculate very much about this Islam
(5:22) uh Israel is currently at war with Hamas Hamas stands for Islamic Resistance Movement A very very uh nice trick by
(5:28) the Islamists to describe themselves as a resistance From the very beginning Hamas made their mission very very clear
(5:35) to destroy Israel and to eradicate the Jewish people This is not just Israeli
(5:42) propaganda It is in Hamas's own declaration rooted in Islamic prophecy In the Hamas charter of 1988 you can
(5:50) read very clearly in article 7 that it says the hour will not come until the Muslims fight the Jews and kill them And
(5:57) the rocks and trees will say "Oh Muslim there is a Jew behind me Come and kill him." Except for the garat tree which is
(6:03) the tree of the Jews You only get something this sick in Islam where you
(6:08) have a Jew tree that is evil because it refuses to snitch on the Jews Uh but the
(6:14) message here is very clear It is the destruction of the Jewish people That is literally what Hamas started out
(6:20) with Hamas doesn't hide this at all After October 7 their leadership declared that they would happily attack
(6:28) Israel over and over again until Israel is completely destroyed and eradicated
(6:33) The leadership of Hamas Fati Hammad a leader among the Palestinian Arabs in
(6:39) Gaza has in 2018 and on multiple occasions explicitly said word for word
(6:45) I'm not exaggerating that within a few years we will fulfill the promise of the
(6:51) eradication the cleansing of the filth of the Jews from the land of Palestine
(6:58) He also said that the second goal after that is to establish or reestablish the
(7:04) Islamic caliphate in Jerusalem And I will come to that in a in a minute in less than a
(7:09) minute Now Hamas is not alone in this The while Gaza is led by Hamas On the
(7:15) other side in the West Bank the Palestinian Authority is in charge The Palestinian Authority uh marks itself as
(7:22) a secular movement But being secular in the Muslim world is not like being secular in the west Being secular there
(7:28) simply means that you establish a political system which is not a theocracy but which is also not free
(7:34) from Islamic influence For example the Palestinian Authority has a Ministry of
(7:39) Religious Affairs which only one week or two weeks after the October 7 terrorist attack instructed mosques and you can
(7:47) find this when you scan the code instructed mosques on October 20th to
(7:52) tell Muslims in the mosques that the time will come when the Muslims will
(7:58) fight and eradicate the Jews When they however speak in English to the world
(8:03) they make it look like all their problem is just about existing and resisting
(8:09) That's not the truth Let's not make any mistakes here While Israel's ambition from the very
(8:14) beginning was to exist and to coexist with the other side the the other side from the very beginning always aimed to
(8:21) eradicate the Jews It's no coincidence that one of the earliest leaders of those Palestinian Arabs was the Grand
(8:27) Mui Hajin al- Husseini who was also a good friend of none other than Hitler
(8:32) who to him directly promised in word we have documents on this that uh if the
(8:38) Nazis win the war they will come down and together annihilate the Jews the
(8:43) leftover Jews in the region and the Islamists will then be in charge of all the Arabs in the region With all of this
(8:51) uh on our minds I want to present three reasons why we should be supporting Zionism Reason number one is to prevent
(8:58) a caliphate This should be a given Eradicating Jews as I just pointed out is not the only not the final goal
(9:04) According to Hamas after the Jews are destroyed the Islamic caliphate would be established In a fantasy world where
(9:11) Hamas uh wins and actually destroys Israel it wouldn't simply end there I
(9:17) know some people might not care about Jews but uh at least care about the other people in the region or care about the history Uh the euphoria would be
(9:25) huge among Muslims I grew up in an environment where it was talked about again and again that the Muslims will
(9:31) rise up again one day If Israel were defeated an Islamic empire would be reestablished and together they would
(9:38) establish brutal Sharia law and begin oppressing all the others in the region as well and then they would probably
(9:45) ally align themselves with Britain which also is very much Islamic today Um in history we can see that over the last
(9:51) 1,400 years Islam did nothing except conquer and
(9:56) slaughter Only last century the Armenian genocide happened At the same time the
(10:02) Assyrians and the Greeks were slaughtered These massacres inspired the Nazis to commit the Holocaust and to
(10:09) slaughter the Polish and Eastern European people The Islamic conquests were only forcibly stopped by the
(10:15) Christian West If they awaken again it would very
(10:20) very quickly lead to the rising of an Islamic empire It is in the best interest of Christians and of even of
(10:27) Muslims that we prevent this and we wish for stability through Israel Reason
(10:33) number two is to protect the Christians Israel is significantly better for Christians and other minorities and even
(10:39) for Muslims than any other alternative that we have in the region Let's take Christians as an example Israel is the only country in
(10:46) the Middle East where Christianity is not shrinking but growing The only place in the Middle
(10:52) East where Christians are overwhelmingly satisfied and happy according to themselves the only place where Christians have full freedoms according
(10:59) to Open Doors International which is a Christian organization that tracks oppression of Christians in the
(11:06) world Meanwhile in Gaza the Christian population is shrinking In the West Bank
(11:11) the Christian population is shrinking In Gaza over the last decades the general population exploded by about 300% At the
(11:19) same time the Christians are about to be non-existent They have shrunk under the number of 1,000 Some people actually
(11:26) come and ridiculously suggest that this might be Israel's fault But how could that be That doesn't make any sense If
(11:33) Israel was at fault then the entire population would be shrinking not just the Christian population Under Israel Christianity
(11:41) thrives Under Islamic persecution Christianity dies
(11:46) In 2014 the Greek Orthodox Archbishop Alexio Singaza said that Hamas use uses
(11:52) the uh the compound of the ancient church of St Pfurious to fire rockets
(11:57) from there at Israel which would inevitably lead to Israel having to respond During this current war the
(12:04) compound of the P St Pfurious church received damage and a building inside there collapsed Guess who people blamed
(12:10) that for Israel Reason number three and here I want to appeal to scripture In Romans 9
(12:18) through11 St Paul writes that his heart is aching for his fellow Israelites that he would give up his own salvation if he
(12:24) could to save them his fellow Jews the Israelites by flesh As he says he makes
(12:31) it very clear that the true Israel are those who believe in Christ But he nonetheless acknowledges that those who
(12:36) reject Christ are still the natural branches He writes "As regard the gospel they are enemies for your sake But as
(12:42) regard election they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers Only for the
(12:47) Jewish people is something like this ever uttered in the Bible He says "For the gifts and calling
(12:54) of God are irrevocable." He warns Christians and says "Do not boast against the natural branches the Israel
(13:00) by flesh If you do remember that you do not support the root but the root supports you." He prophesied He said
(13:07) that there is a partial hardening upon Israel at this moment but that God will
(13:12) through a mystery change things and in the future remove sin from the people of Israel and
(13:19) graft them back in and therefore all Israel will be saved St Kirill of Alexandria also said based on this that
(13:27) Israel in the future will be reconciled to Christ through faith St Augustine
(13:32) said that the survival of the Jewish people is a huge sign from God and that they will eventually be reconciled St
(13:38) John Chroasum despite his harsh rhetoric about Jews said that it is bound to
(13:43) happen in the future before the end that the Jewish people will be grafted back in by
(13:49) God I want to finally also quote a respected Orthodox hierarch metropolitan Kalisto where who recently died who also
(13:57) very very emotionally uh in the '9s wrote an article in which he said that
(14:03) the Jews are still God's chosen people until the end Let us never show the slightest disrespect or hatred toward
(14:10) them I went to Israel myself I saw the people there when I was still an ice
(14:17) cold atheist I experienced the people there I exper I had interactions with
(14:23) religious Jews there My time in Israel is something that led me to question everything I realized one thing which is
(14:29) that these people are amazing despite what every everyone says And it didn't
(14:34) make sense to me that uh people around the world would vilify the Jewish people It certainly cannot be because of the
(14:40) way they are When I open the Bible today in which I firmly believe I see that St
(14:46) Paul loved the Jews who rejected Christ God still loves them and still has a
(14:51) plan for them forever I love them too and I think everyone should support them in their fight for survival instead of
(14:58) letting them die Thank you Thank you very much for that 12minute opening from
(15:03) RIVAN
(15:11) We'll kick it over to Andrew for his 12minute opening as well The floor is all yours Andrew Good evening ladies and
() 
(15:17) gentlemen Before we dive into the topic at hand can we get a standing ovation
(15:22) for Ribbon and his acceptance as an Orthodox Catacuman Welcome home brother
(15:36) [Applause] [Music]
(15:42) And now it's time for you to lose The topic tonight is significantly
(15:48) narrower than I think many people are comfortable with It's often in the ambiguity that people make emotional
(15:54) arguments instead of using logic and reason And that's exactly what you will see tonight from my opponent which you
(15:59) did which is why I wanted to narrow the topic to avoid this ambiguity You will
(16:05) see from him emotional rhetoric rhetoric but no actual arguments which we didn't The topic at hand is simple enough The
(16:12) proposition is do Christians have some sort of ought to support the political ideology of Zionism Apostate Prophet
(16:19) says yes I say no For the purpose of this debate I will be using the most charitable definition of Zionism which
(16:25) is the one AP agreed to pre-debate so that everyone's clear A movement for originally the reestablishment and now
(16:32) the development and protection of a Jewish nation which is now Israel Seems straightforward enough So let's get into
(16:38) it I will be presenting four logical arguments for why Christians have no such obligation secular or otherwise to
(16:45) support this Jewish political endeavor I will order them with my weakest objection first and my strongest
(16:50) objection last Note I have many more arguments than the ones I'll lay out tonight but for the sake of time I'll
(16:56) just stick with four To preface these arguments I'll explain that Rivven cannot make the claim that the religion
(17:02) of Judaism isn't part of Zionism The right of return applies to both religious and ethnic Jews Israeli law
(17:09) defines Jewish as someone who is born to a Jewish mother or who has converted to Judaism In other words the very people
(17:15) group defined as both religious Jews and non-religious Jews emphasizing all Jews have the right of return According to
(17:21) legal expert Nancy C Richmond in her analysis of Israel's law of return published in Penn State International
(17:27) Law Review quote "While Israel is not a theocracy the Jewish religion has a central role in Israeli politics because
(17:33) the main purpose of the country's establishment was to create an independent Jewish state." End quote
(17:39) This analysis is shared by virtually every scholar I can find pro or anti-Zionist and is logical due to the
(17:45) fact that if Zionism really had nothing to do with the Jewish religion it wouldn't specify Jewish converts as
(17:50) being allowed this right of return Very simple This is an important preface as apostate prophets going to argue this as
(17:57) a secular state and that's simply untrue as a matter of fact This leads me to argument one There is no ought under
(18:05) Christian ethics to support other religions which specifically oppose doctrine and an establishment of a
(18:10) homeland for them The Jewish religion is acknowledged as being incorrect by every
(18:16) major Christian branch This includes the Eastern Orthodox Church which apostate prophet is converting to as well as
(18:22) mainline protestant protestant and Roman Catholics The specific problem here is particularly the denial of Jesus Christ
(18:28) being the Messiah as outlined in simple language in 1 John 2:23 No one who
(18:34) denies the son has the father Whoever acknowledges the son has the father also In simple terms if you don't accept
(18:40) Jesus Christ as lord and savior you don't worship the same god Christians
(18:45) worship Now this is also found in John 14:6 Jesus says "I am the way the truth and
(18:51) the life and no one comes to the father but through me." Christ as a messiah is a is central to the creed of every major
(18:58) Christian profession of faith So my first argument concludes Christians ought not support it this heretical for
(19:06) Christian political ideology and supporting heretical ideology is itself sinful as it violates Christian ethics
(19:12) The argument itself premise one Christians who support heretical ideology denying the divinity of Christ
(19:18) are sinning Premise two religious Jews reject the divinity of Christ after he's revealed himself to them as the savior
(19:25) Premise three if religious Jews reject Christ they are incorrect And Christians who claim they aren't are spreading
(19:30) heresy Conclusion religious Jews are by Christian standards wrong and should not
(19:36) be supported by Christians who would be spreading a heresy If they acknowledge Jewish theology is correct or give it
(19:41) support to reduce it to a much simpler view If one of my daughters had an only
(19:47) fans I would still love her We are commanded as we were commanded to love the Jews and the Muslims But I'm not
(19:52) going to promote it I'm not going to promote it Argument two the pragmatic argument and its response Ridban focuses
(19:58) a lot on the pragmatic approach through geopolitics to make an aught for support for Christians toward Zionism focusing
(20:04) on the anti-Muslim factor rather than the Christian ethics factor The pragmatic argument from him is simple If
(20:10) we have to choose to support the state of Israel who are seemingly at least sympathetic to the West and Christian
(20:15) nations then we should or Muslims will dominate the region unopposed There's no way Um and they are in no way
(20:21) sympathetic to the West This is in my opinion his best argument but it falls flat because it focuses on a false
(20:28) dialectic that relies on facious reasoning In his view of pragmatism he presents two choices where there are
(20:34) actually hundreds of choices uh or more For instance there isn't from a purely
(20:40) pragmatic approach any reason I can think of for the protectors of Israel in this case the West to demand Israel open
(20:46) itself up to tens of thousands of Christian missionaries yearly and give them all infranchise
(20:51) status Many many thousands of Christians would love to live there This would
(20:56) effectively end the quote Jewish state apparatus which would appease Muslims and also create a dynamic for which
(21:02) Christians could begin their work of converting Jews to Christianity which is their mandate Jews would not be be uh
(21:08) persecuted under this arrangement and would still be able to freely practice Judaism as they saw fit and would be
(21:13) infranchised to vote just like they are in all other nations They also would have more protections from other nations
(21:19) who have vested interest in their settlers Will this plan work I have no idea No clue But to pretend it couldn't
(21:26) be done creates a false dialectic that only two choices exist where many choices exist Ridan would have to
(21:32) effectively argue Israel would need to remain a Jewish state from a secular view which to quote a thing he says often that makes no sense Why Why does
(21:41) the state actually need to be a Jewish ethnostate and Jewish religious state in order to protect Jews That's actually
(21:46) rather stupid Uh all Western nations afford Jewish people the same rights as all of the citizens get Redban from the
(21:53) pragmatic approach would actually have to argue that Israel remain a Jewish state from a secular standpoint which he
(21:58) can't do As long as the state protected Jews and they were allowed to practice a religion why would it be a problem if it
(22:04) wasn't dominated by Jews themselves To formalize this argument to RVan premise one Jews deserve a homeland for both
(22:10) ethnic Jewish individuals and religious Jewish individuals This is his view Premise two the Jewish homeland is
(22:16) necessary because it protects Jews from persecution Premise three the Jewish homeland can't let in majorities of
(22:21) other groups for its own protection Conclusion Israel must remain an ethnic religious state with a supermaajority of
(22:26) Jewish people Now you can see here the conclusion doesn't actually follow from the premise The key here seems to be
(22:32) that Jewish individuals deserve protection from a pro uh atrocity Uh but the case isn't being made why they would
(22:38) specifically need a Jewish state to do so Early anti-ionist Jews made similar counterarguments as well Social
(22:44) dominance and culture doesn't assure prevention from atrocity for Jews any better than being a protected class
(22:50) under a different dominant culture This seemingly can be viewed right now by the conflict going on with Hamas at least
(22:57) not logically and not pragmatically Also we could use accelerated pragmatism here to point out the absurdity of this false
(23:04) dialectic by simply pointing out it could be pragmatic to nuke the entire Middle East Israel included and no
(23:11) longer worry about Middle Eastern conflicts and cultures ever Uh but my guess is most people would rightly state
(23:16) that would be against Christian ethics which rejects pragmatism for Christian ethics which Rid also should do Now even
(23:24) in easily dismantling the pragmatic argument I will simply now grant it and the false dialectic of a binary choice
(23:30) to simply point out that even if I do it still doesn't provide an aught for why Christians must support Zionism which is
(23:37) both hilarious and ironic but does provide us for not for Christians to not support it because you're being
(23:42) presented with a false binary My last argument is the most important It combines two arguments together for the
(23:47) sake of time This argument focuses on the biggest ought not for Christians and
(23:53) requires a preface The first preface is that Israel refuses to disclose if it has nuclear weapons and will neither
(23:58) confirm nor deny if they do nor allow any inspection of them if they do Our own CIA has confirmed they do but they
(24:04) don't disclose it Second the Israeli government works handinhand with the Temple Institute and American Evangelicals Also there is an
(24:11) organization called Kufi or Christians Unified for Israel Goofy has 10 million members and Israel doesn't even have 10
(24:17) million citizens Goofy spreads the false heresy of dispensationalism and host charismatic doctrine heresy as well By
(24:24) Ridan's own faith he knows these are heresies Goofy's on over 300 college campuses and growing Their stated goal
(24:30) is to educate millions of Americans on these heresies according to their own website quote through our 16 social
(24:36) media accounts websites blogs daily briefs to bring in groups of pastors and next generation influencers and students
(24:42) to Israel every year Guys like Charlie Kirk and dare I say Rid Van and David
(24:49) Wood and others to quote those would be the types of influencers who would be their target Not saying that that Kufi
(24:56) paid for any of that I'm just saying that would be the target to reach thousands through Kufi Weekly and Israel
(25:02) Collective uh videos on YouTube He's brought in over a thousand major influencers including celebrities All of
(25:07) this is right from their site Now what do these people want you ask Well they This is going to blow your mind but this
(25:13) is what they want They want to assist with the fulfillment of biblical prophecy to bring about a new false
(25:19) messiah and usher in an Armageddon Not kidding Not kidding Now the Temple
(25:24) Institute's goal in Israel using both private and Israeli state money is to rebuild the third temple and name a
(25:30) Messiah which Christians know is a false messiah Israel the supposed secular state gives large swats of money to the
(25:36) Temple Institute and many government officials back this undertaking So remember when I said Christians ought
(25:41) not support heresies Well here's why Right now this second major personalities on the right such as
(25:47) Charlie Kirk most of the day Daily Wire even perhaps David Wood and Ridban themselves who I like know for sure that
(25:55) any messiah named by Israel will be Antichrist They know it Now perhaps not
(26:02) the antichrist but the spirit of Antichrist will be with whoever this person is And they have to denounce
(26:08) Christians definitionally Have to So to recap the supposed secular Zionist
(26:14) government is giving money to the religious Zionists in Israel and get American support to do this with both
(26:19) American government money and direct aid with mega preachers like John Hegy leading the charge in America with Kufi
(26:24) to back this endeavor to usher in Antichrist So Ridban I will see any
(26:31) argument you make for why Christians ought to support uh Zionism and I will raise you one antichrist as not not This
(26:40) is the most powerful ought not for Christians to support Zionism and is
(26:46) really the one argument I want Ridban to address as it's my primary argument So
(26:51) the formal argument goes like this Premise one Christians should not support false messiah or antichrist ever
(26:58) Premise two Zionists are attempting to name a false messiah Premise three secular and religious Zionists are
(27:03) working together to bring about biblical prophecy and name a false messiah Conclusion: Christians shouldn't support
(27:10) Zionism especially not a Zionist nation with an antichrist at its head and nukes which it won't
(27:17) acknowledge False messiah head of a state with nukes Genius
(27:24) Ridden Now to end it very quickly with this I'm going to enjoy this spirited
(27:30) debate Um but I really want you to address this argument with that Oh the
(27:37) uh the floor is back Go ahead Much
(27:44) [Applause] Thank you very much gentlemen for those
(27:50) openings We'll jump into the fiveminute rebuttals AP the floor is all yours
() 
(27:55) So when Andrew announced that he was going to have a very very amazing um opening speech here I was expecting
(28:01) something incredible What I heard is not very impressive to be very honest Is anybody actually impressed Because
(28:07) here's the issue He said that uh that I'm going to rely on uh on pragmatism
(28:14) Wrong False He said that I'm going to argue from emotion Maybe I mixed emotion into it
(28:20) rightly so But I argued on emotion based on scripture Number three he listed a
(28:26) bunch of things that I never even addressed that I never even think about And he even made the false assumption that I would call Israel a secular state
(28:32) Israel is not a secular state Israel is in in some way secular But Israel is very very explicitly from the very
(28:39) beginning of its foundation partly built on religious grounds This is acknowledged from the very beginning It
(28:45) is a compromise that was made in the history of of Israel and the founding of Israel that it would be partially founded upon uh religious Jewish values
(28:53) and partially on on secular values because the secular ones were the ones who advocated for the building of Israel
(28:58) but the religious ones were also uh in on it and wanted also uh their rights to be protected which only makes sense
(29:05) There is one big issue that uh Andrew here is um has a problem with In my
(29:10) opening statement I never ever argued that it is an obligation for Christians to support Israel I did say uh
(29:18) Christians should I I did say it would be the right thing I did say it would be morally right I never ever made it look
(29:26) like it is uh an obligation for Christians or it is within their religion that they that they must
(29:33) support the state of Israel I argued that within certain things that we read
(29:39) within the Bible which by the way he never even came close to addressing And
(29:45) I'm sure he will not come close to addressing because he can't really get out of that Uh it would be the right
(29:50) thing to do for Christians not to stand by and let those people die whom God if you open Romans 9:11 still loves despite
(29:59) their unbelief I want everyone to uh to read this again and again Open your own
(30:05) Bibles Open the Bible Open Romans 9 through11 Read it again St Paul condemns
(30:12) their unbelief and still says that God loves them and still says that God has a
(30:18) plan for them Even those who have rejected and have fallen into disbelief and who were broken off He says it is a
(30:24) mystery of God that he uh took the wild branches the Gentiles and put them into
(30:31) the tree and he broke off the natural branches which are the Jews and just like that he will bring them back in it
(30:39) add them back to the tree This is precisely what Romans 11 says The narrative here is that these Jews not
(30:45) just Jews who follow a certain type of Judaism not just Jews who follow this Judaism or who do this or who do that He
(30:53) says "Jews by flesh my fellow Israelites." That's literally what he's
(30:59) saying He's never talking about a distinction of religious belief among Jews He says Jews by flesh So when
(31:06) Andrew talks about how um lots of these people are secular people they don't believe in Judaism It doesn't matter St
(31:12) Paul talks about Jews by flesh Do you want to contest that I would not contest it because that's what my Bible says
(31:17) This is not Protestant reasoning Sit down and look at the scripture This is literally what it says
(31:23) Uh I never said that supporting uh Jews or supporting Israel requires that we uh
(31:28) somehow acknowledge their theology as correct This is uh ridiculous This is absurd It is facious Nobody is required
(31:34) to do that What we what we would be uh in in our right to do is to look at the
(31:40) Middle East Another thing to address here by the way which I uh mentioned on my opening statement Israel
(31:46) significantly treats Christians better than the other side does Would you rather support the other side or would
(31:53) you rather support the Jewish people I would rather support those that my Bible describes as still beloved by God and
(32:00) those who have a track record of actually protecting Christian people Whereas all the other Muslim nations
(32:06) together have a history of oppressing them and if they gain the power and yes if you don't support Israel then you are
(32:13) supporting the other side If they regain power it will only lead to more oppression of your fellow Christians
(32:18) This is not pragmatism It is about caring for your fellow Christians and caring for those that God says he still
(32:26) loves Not pragmatism I'm not sure where you get pragmatism here Uh Andrew says that um there's an
(32:33) alternative of Christians going and settling there Please let's not be ridiculous Um so
(32:39) that's that would be the least likely option Finally rebuilding of the temple and the antichrist The best polls put
(32:46) the number of people who want to reestablish the temple at uh a maximum of 30% Are you serious
(32:54) Oh is that all Thank you very much for that five minute rebuttal We'll kick it over to Andrew for his fiveminute
() 
(33:00) rebuttal as well Yeah So I mean this is a no-brainer He didn't actually address my arguments Notice that I put my
(33:06) arguments even in simple premise form so that even you even you could have addressed them So it was very simple He
(33:14) did not actually address why it is Christians have an ought to support a nation which he admits is attempting to
(33:22) create Antichrist They're going to they're going to name a false messiah Any Messiah that the Jewish nation names
(33:30) by definition has to be false under Christianity By definition that false messiah also has to condemn Christians
(33:37) right Because how could he not if he's the Messiah He'll have to say that Christ was not divine Blasphemy against
(33:44) the Holy Spirit Rid van So the thing is is he also brings up multiple false dialectics right Again false dialectic
(33:52) after false dialectic First I was not saying that Rid Van takes the position
(33:58) that uh that this is a secular state but that even if he did the argument wouldn't matter Right So I'm doing an
(34:04) internal critique I'm arguing both sides to still show how I'm correct and you're
(34:09) not Uh when he dives into some of these other arguments let's go through them real quick He says "God still loves the
(34:17) Jews God loves everybody He wants Muslims back in the fold as well." Okay It's not just It's not just about
(34:24) bringing Jewish people back in the fold It's about bringing everybody back into the fold It's another false dialectic
(34:29) The church The church is Israel We're not talking about a specific bloodline
(34:35) people group okay That's not what we're discussing And that's when you're talking about St Paul And we can bring
(34:41) this up especially when you're talking about the cutting off the limbs of the tree Paul is specifically saying that he
(34:47) himself would give up everything if it meant that his people who rejected Christ would come back to Christ I would
(34:54) love that But RVan they haven't And the temple institute which is there and I
(35:00) need you to acknowledge this Raven is trying to name antichrist You said only
(35:06) 30% want to name Is that all 30% This is just an insignificant number
(35:13) 30% and it's by the way he's also not telling you this It's increasing It's not decreasing It's increasing And
(35:20) they're getting more positions in government And he knows they're getting more positions in government How can we
(35:26) have a nuclear armed nation that the United States and Christians in the
(35:31) United States is supporting who wants to name an antichrist Please answer that question
(35:38) Raven Please pretty please with sugar on top Why ought I send my big American
(35:45) dollars which I want to give to my kids for college and other things to a nation
(35:50) that uh wants to name the antithesis the the antithetical the entire opposite of
(35:57) Christianity antichrist Need that answered My primary argument for an
(36:03) ought not need something better than well because geopolitically if uh if uh
(36:08) Israel is not there bad things bad things could happen It's like yeah they could maybe they maybe they don't though
(36:14) That's a false dialectic It's called a false binary You keep presenting false choices If this if a happens then b
(36:21) assuredly will happen You don't know that You have no idea if that's the case you're just making that uh um you know
(36:29) kind of assertion without even admitting either that it's facious argumentation It's you can look up the fallacy It's a
(36:36) false binary fallacy And with that please I'll yield the time right back over I need an answer to this
(36:44) We'll actually be jumping into the crossfire section It's about 15 minutes
(36:49) Sean from Unensurred uh I should say Sean the leader of uncensored America asked me to give you guys a long leash
(36:56) So commit RIP for 15 minutes The floor is yours Do you acknowledge Andrew that
() 
(37:02) uh that the Jews are actually in an extermination war for their survival right now Uh yeah I would say that
(37:08) they're in a war for uh survival Sure Okay So uh do you also acknowledge that
(37:13) um if they don't have the support that they need uh the other side wants to exterminate them which you just
(37:18) acknowledged basically and that they could be exterminated as a result Even if I were let's just say I'll just grant
(37:24) the whole thing So I'll just grant for the sake of argument that if the United States were to pull out support from
(37:29) Israel tomorrow that the nation would be exterminated Let's just grant it Right As horrible as this is nobody wants to
(37:34) see anything like this That's still not an odd for white Christians have to support him Riven It's still not an
(37:40) claim You're still not making the moral a claim for why Christians have some moral duty to step in on behalf of a
(37:47) secular Zionist state that has religious components that wants to name antichrist Can we please get to that Do you
(37:53) acknowledge that uh if that if Israel is destroyed and the Jews are eradicated in the region this will lead to the reestablishment of the historical enemy
(38:00) of Christianity which also led to the destruction of Orthodox Christians in the could but also it could Listen I'll
(38:08) give you the logical acknowledgement It could Can you give me the logical acknowledgement that Western nations can
(38:13) also prevent this from happening even if Israel's not there Logically they can't actually Logically they can't No no no
(38:19) Raven listen Not saying that it would be the case Only that logically it could be an extremely low likelihood It's
(38:25) ridiculous to even Why are we talking about then it's a false binary Is is there is there is there a fantasy Like
(38:31) do you think that Christians would actually go there and take over If you if you grant that there's other possibilities just with lower likelihood
(38:37) then you're admitting you're engaging in the fallacy of a false binary So then let's let's do this That's it Let's do this If if the if the Jews in the region
(38:43) are destroyed do you think it is much more likely that the Muslims will take over or do you think it's much more likely that the West will step in and
(38:50) somehow stop this Even if I again even if I grant the argument for likelihood it's still a false binary because you
(38:56) have admitted that there's other options which also could be utilized So you have just admitted that it is extremely
(39:02) likely in such a case that the that the Muslims will take over and reestablish a caliphate which had which is hellbent on
(39:09) fighting and oppressing when the Jews are done then the Christians are next There's a saying in the Middle East which you think support first the Sunday
(39:15) people then first the Saturday people then don't fill a bus ribbon Do you think I support Muslims You are
(39:21) supporting them You are supporting them by not supporting Israel That's basically what you're doing Okay then So
(39:26) by not supporting Israel I'm supporting Muslims right Yes Yes Then by by not supporting Muslims you're supporting
(39:33) Antichrist Does that make sense No it doesn't make sense Does that make sense No it doesn't make sense Redmond It
(39:38) doesn't make any sense because it's a facious argument doesn't make any sense Makes no sense because what you're
(39:43) because what you're suggesting you you think that the existence of Israel itself would lead because of certain
(39:51) plans certain conspiracy theories to the rise of the conspiracy theory Let's go A planning of the antichrist to come
(39:58) Because of this because of this you want to risk the people that God loves By the
(40:04) way very very big issue here I specifically said that the Jews are the only people according to Paul himself
(40:10) who is especially beloved by God So you're saying Jew for their sake of Yes
(40:15) For the sake of Yes And do you do you think that the Orthodox Church supports for the sake of their ancestors You
(40:20) think that the Orthodox Church believes that uh Jews have magic Jew blood which puts them above Orthodox Christians No
(40:27) Then your point is moved What does What does he What does Paul say Does he say that they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers
(40:34) Uh well yeah but you're also What does that mean But you're What does that mean For the sake of their forefathers I'll
(40:40) grant it What does that mean I'll grant it You are also beloved for the sake of your forefathers The Jews are also
(40:46) beloved for the sake of your forefathers Because there's no magic Jew blood ridden All right let me read There's no
(40:52) mic It's not magic It's not made out of magic It's made out of the same thing as my blood and your blood Now let's read
(40:57) this So Paul says that they are especially Hang on before you divert a
(41:02) few minutes What What do you mean You never I'll dive into this You never address this topic My main argument is
(41:08) about antichrist Here is your main argument It's about antichrist Ribbon Look at this Can hang on Ribbon He
(41:13) equates this He equates this to look at this St Paul says "For I could wish that I myself were accursed
(41:19) and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers the kinsmen according to the flesh." He says "Magic blood." He's
(41:24) making fun of Paul here Actually I'm not making fun of any They are Israelites by flesh This is what he's making fun of
(41:30) This is not what I'm saying And to them belong the adoption the glory the covenants the giving of the law the
(41:36) worship the promises the patriarchs the race according to the flesh is the Christ who is God over all Blessed
(41:43) forever Amen Does anybody else fall into this category Andrew except for the Jews Yes Yes We no are Israel We are beloved
(41:51) of God We are the fulfillment of the promise Paul talks Paul We are the fulfillment of the promise Paul talks
(41:58) about your own faith Paul talks about two Israel If you have an understanding of what he talks about here you would
(42:03) see this in an easy in the Orthodox study Bible which says that he's talking about two Israels One is the natural
(42:09) Israel one is the spiritual Israel Okay Are Jews above Orthodox Doesn't matter Are they Doesn't matter Are they doesn't
(42:14) matter Answer the question Doesn't matter What does it doesn't matter mean Do you acknowledge Are Jews above Orthodox Christians Do you acknowledge
(42:20) that Christians won't answer questions Look I need you to answer the question Are Jews above Orthodox Christians No
(42:26) Okay No Thank you Do you acknowledge that That's done It's done Okay Can you
(42:32) answer this question since I answered your question Do you acknowledge that according to Paul Jews are especially
(42:38) beloved because of their ancestry of all people But Paul's also making a demonstration that thank you I would
(42:44) thank you So Jews are especially beloved but so are you especially also
(42:50) especially beloved do to your ancestors Were my ancestors given the covenants Were they given the the law of Orthodox
(42:56) Christians No So what makes what makes Orthodox Christians then equal with the most beloved of God You're straw maning
(43:03) it You're strawmaning it You don't understand the logic here I say I say that Paul clearly says that they are
(43:09) especially beloved aside from those who are especially who are the spiritual
(43:14) Israel The Jews because of their ancestry are especially beloved What does especially mean You want to
(43:20) basically deny what Paul is saying What does especially beloved mean They are especially beloved for the Does that
(43:25) mean that they're loved more than by God than you ribbon actually if you want to think about it
(43:32) in comparison to somebody to somebody who is not a Christian and who is not a Jewish yes they are beloved more by God
(43:38) okay so then what you're saying is that just by the fact that they have magic Jew blood loves them more than you now
(43:45) you are making fun of the Bible no that's not listen that's not biblical what's actually being said here now I'll
(43:50) step through all of this with you if you want right but that's not what's being said I just admitted is that You put
(43:57) Jewish people above Orthodox Christians because you think God loves them more No I explicitly said I explicitly said they
(44:04) are not above and I explicitly just compared them to non-Christians You heard that right Everybody has heard that Jews in comparison to other
(44:10) non-Christians are especially beloved to God This is literally what Paul says You might scuff about it as much as you
(44:17) want I cited St John I cited St Augustine I cited St Purel I cited a
(44:22) recent Orthodox hierarch Mhm Metropolitan Kalistos Where Metropolitan
(44:27) Kalistos is where the very say that God loves a Jewish person cuz he's Jewish more than you Yes No he won't Yes he
(44:34) won't That's what No he won't Nobody's ever going to say that ever Here's the thing So here let's here's the thing
(44:39) Andrew If you can't go through this with If you can't accept what the Bible says and what the hierarchs say dude you
(44:44) can't entire debate We have to go through the scripture Do you want to go through it You never answered my question Okay let's start with 11 Never
(44:49) answered my argument You have an answer to mine My very first argument Here's my contention I answered all your questions
(44:55) You never answer Can we talk about Antichrist then What What is it to talk about Okay Can I Can I ask you to
(45:01) contend with my argument Here's the argument I literally put it in premise form Let's do it again Okay So let's do
(45:08) that again Yeah Yeah It's very important that this actually gets answered And I'm happy to go through the scripture with you You didn't understand it the first
(45:13) time Let's do it again Okay Yeah You never actually answered to it I answered it No you didn't Okay So uh you agree
(45:20) that Zionists are attempting to name a false messiah that that is a critical function of Zionist I would say
(45:27) religious Jews asking can I even ask the question you just asked answer I have to qualify so that you understand what's
(45:32) being asked Okay sure okay so premise one Christians are uh should not support
(45:38) a false messiah or an antichrist Do you agree with that Yeah You do Yeah Okay
(45:44) Premise two Zionists are attempting to name a Messiah No Okay So then can you
(45:50) explain why the Zionist government gives money to the Temple Institute who has a stated goal of naming a messiah You are
(45:56) talking about Zionists as a general term Zionists are all those who support the existence of Israel That would be the
(46:02) second would be the majority of the Israeli population That's not what Zionism means That is literally what
(46:07) Zionist Now what you said Zionism meant and I'll give you your exact definition It meant an establishment of a Jewish
(46:13) state And you agreed it couldn't be secular It had to be religious and it had to be secular So if the religious
(46:19) and the secular are both working towards a goal then what is it I never said that Then what is it You're not paying
(46:24) attention to the details Okay I can't wait to hear it Establishing establishing a Jewish state a state for Jews in the land of Israel right The
(46:31) same thing is wanted is wanted by by conservative Jews by Orthodox Jews by by atheist Jews All all Jews want this The
(46:39) all want does not require it to be completely in alignment with certain
(46:45) aspects of orthodox Jewish uh theology Got it Totally agree So we've established it So when you say Zionists
(46:51) want this then you are overgeneralizing because when you say all that necessarily includes who has a right to
(46:57) return religious Jews as well and if the the secular Jews are funding with money
(47:04) the religious Jews towards X goal that would be all Jews doing this The logic
(47:09) here the logic in question is that you are saying that all that basically you
(47:14) could make the same argument that all Christians want to establish an apocalyptic Israel in the mil Why Why
(47:22) Because why Because Protestants are Christians and they believe in an esquetology that includes the reestablishment of Israel You're not
(47:28) making a nuance nuance and is federal government funding these Protestants and
(47:34) bringing about this army You're failing to make a nuance distinction between certain making the nuance distinction
(47:39) Let me respond Is the is the United States federal government funding these uh these groups these uh these free
(47:45) groups who are moving who are moving towards dispensationalism Let me ask you this question Riven can I ask it before
(47:51) you answer it Sure Okay great So is the United States government funding Protestants to usher in Armageddon I
(47:57) have no idea You have no idea Are they Yeah the answer is no But is it the case that Zionists are indeed funding the
(48:04) Temple Institute who does want to bring in Antichrist Some Zionists Yes Not all Z Would you like to go through what the
(48:10) state of Israel gives the Temple Institute or are you denying that they give them money No of course they give them money Okay great Antichrist Here's
(48:17) my question to you You say Zionists Do secular Jews who are also Zionists uh
(48:22) generally agree with the rebuilding of the third temple Uh well if if it is the case do they secular Jews are funding Do
(48:30) they agree with the building of the of the third temple Maybe not Not Okay fantastic So when you say Zionists then
(48:35) you are overgeneralizing and making a mistake I'm not because Zionism includes all Jews No it doesn't We just
(48:41) established that secular Jews don't support the building of the So is there secular Zionism and other types of
(48:47) Zionism Yes there is Zionism in general Zionism Can we maybe go with a
(48:52) definition like Zionism means that Jews want to reestablish a homeland and they're calling this homeland Israel and
(48:58) they want it protected Can we like go with that definition Andrew did you not listen to me Yeah Are you not listening
(49:03) I said it right here Andrew Do you want me to read this again Andrew Yes Do you want me to read this Yeah Read it again Zionism alone simply means the
(49:10) establishment and protection of a land a country a state where Jews can live freely a Jewish state in what is now
(49:17) known as Israel Does this mean it has to be a religious state Have you not
(49:22) listened to So wait we've got it So then this would apply to secular Jews and religious Jews Yes Yes
(49:29) So so then if it's all Jews support if it's secular Jews supporting religious
(49:35) Jews by giving them money right by giving them money so that they can establish antichrist then that would be
(49:42) Zionists doing it right So because logic logic some Zionists support a certain
(49:49) religious movement that most Zionists by the way do not support we are therefore to conclude that all Zionists by
(49:55) definition support the rebuilding of the third temple Hang on Is it increasing It doesn't make any sense What I say his
(50:00) main argument would be doesn't make any sense It makes total sense And I'll explain it I say making any sense Should I as a
(50:07) Christian send my support over to a country where 30% of them want to introduce Antichrist Yes Okay
(50:15) Why not I don't know where else to go with that I don't know where else to go with No I have a question to to you Andrew Where else do I go with that I
(50:22) have a question to you Andrew When when when St Paul says that they are still beloved and that God still has a plan to
(50:27) reconcile them and to bring to graft them back into a tree Do you think that he's talking about all the good Jews or
(50:33) is he just talking about uh he's talking about what what happens when they finally bend their knee to Jesus Christ
(50:39) their Lord and Savior Wonderful Wonderful And now it's my follow-up question Andrew Now is my follow-up
(50:45) question If you allow the enemies of both Christians and Jews to try and
(50:50) eradicate them do you think that you will do God and Paul in the Bible a service here I'm sorry If you think that
(50:58) Jews have magic Jew blood and are therefore the most beloved of God isn't it the case that even if we didn't
(51:03) support Israel God would love them so much that he would never let their enemies take down If a if a robber comes into your home Yeah Uh you could just
(51:10) leave it up to God to handle it You don't have to do anything It doesn't make any sense You are still like you're the most beloved Does it sound like
(51:17) you're the most beloved You are still supposed to fulfill the obligation to morally Why is my obligation right Great
(51:22) Let's talk about what is morally right An ought Why Again give me a moral paradigm from a moral paradigm Andrew
(51:30) Christians even though you agreed with me on premise one should not support any type of false messiah Should
(51:36) not support the naming of any type of false messiah Andrew you and your government need to send tons of money to a nation which 30% of it by your own
(51:44) admission I think it's higher and growing by the way but I'll just grant 30% wants to name false Messiah Raven
(51:51) can you please in a very concise way tell me why it is that I need to send my support my money to a nation which is
(51:57) funding that endeavor Yes Very simply Yeah Very very simply But then we actually have to wrap up and go to the audience Because uh the Jews were always
(52:04) expecting a Messiah Even at the time of St Paul they were expecting a Messiah And when St Paul talked about how he
(52:10) still has love for them and how God still loves them and how God will will naturally graft them in And even when
(52:15) all the saints that I just mentioned talked about how Jews are expecting a Messiah and the Christ will come and
(52:20) reconcile them they clearly did talk about all Jews who are still expecting a false messiah Therefore you should
(52:26) support them Okay Wait a second Wait a second We're done Who said that we shouldn't love Jews for being Jewish
(52:32) It's fine that we can love Muslims and Jews and atheists and everybody You're finished
(52:38) But this is that was a ridiculous answer though We give you a chance to respond We do have to go Q&A Ridiculous answer Folks
(52:46) the way this is going to work for the Q&A is if you come up the middle and stand right in front of me we'll
(52:51) actually give you a chance to give a couple of follow-up responses if you'd like as long as they're short and piffy
(52:58) I'll still hold the mic just in case things get weird Okay ready Please come up with your questions and then if you
(53:05) could put your toes right here in front of the tape Hey sorry for your loss
(53:11) Well I was just going to ask Andrew for his answer to that The cope is painful Raven
() 
(53:16) The cope is painful Although I was just going to ask Andrew his response for the what he just said Yeah Yeah So I mean
(53:22) it's super simple Saying that we need to love everybody right Regardless of the
(53:28) the heinous things that they might have even engaged in Nobody said that you as a Christian are not you're not obligated
(53:34) to have love for people who are Jewish and Muslim and everything else That doesn't provide an ought for why Christians have to support Zionism
(53:40) though It literally doesn't He gave a descriptor instead He said descriptively this is the case You can't get an ought
(53:47) from an is giving me a descriptor doesn't address the ought that Christians should do anything It's never
(53:54) about loving them Andrew It's about supporting those No it's about them being extra loved And by the way we'll
(54:00) allow you guys rebuttals throughout if you'd like Yeah I just have a curious
(54:05) question on um AP's position on the Jews of Israel How do you know that the Jews
(54:11) in Israel today are the same contextual Jews in the Bible It doesn't really matter because
(54:18) um yes it doesn't matter It doesn't matter at all Why does it matter And and
(54:23) how do you want to prove that they are actually the same Jews Do you want to prove that by blood Do you want to prove that by tradition We have um in the
(54:31) Bible when Paul deals with the people in his time who are Israelites who are Israelites by his flesh he talks about
(54:37) those who still hold on to the traditions that's what he points out He says that they have a very great zeal
(54:42) for God and for the law That's what he says about those that he considers evil Um and uh he points out that because of
(54:49) their traditions they take their traditions so far that they fail to see the truth in the true Messiah Those Jews
(54:56) continued after the fall of the second temple to still hold on to their traditions and to develop a new tradition which is called rabbitic
(55:02) Judaism which started as soon as the temple fell Those same Jews held on to their traditions and continued to be the
(55:09) very same Jews that we have today The Judaism that started when the temple fell was rabbinic Judaism The Jews that
(55:15) we have today are rabbitic Jews They are the same Jews There's arguments to be
(55:20) made against this including that they're not doing sacrifices in a tabernacle or in the temple So it may not be the true
(55:26) succession of rabbitic Judaism but even granting the fact that there's a possibility that it is It doesn't really
(55:33) matter because when we're talking about Paul here he says he says bloodline itself is irrelevant That's not But what
(55:40) do you think Paul was talking about when he said my people Do you think he was talking about some future people that wasn't a part of the people group he's
(55:46) addressing right then No No he wasn't That that's nowhere in the scripture here It actually is Well then you've
(55:53) refuted your argument twice because now you're saying what he's saying is there's a future group of people who
(55:58) could be considered Israel right Who are not the group of people he's talking about right this second I would say
(56:04) Raven that we know who that people group is the church and Christians No because
(56:10) he's talking about those who have rejected Christ How can that be the church and and how are they going to be reconciled How can the church be those
(56:16) who rejected Christ How can the church be those who are in sin and who are in their rejection and who are enemies
(56:22) because of of you because of the uh because of the gospel but still beloved to God because of their ancestors How
(56:28) can that be the church again When we move that doesn't make any sense You want to move any sense So when we move
(56:34) into this what I'm arguing to you is when you say a reconciliation for these people I want them to come back into God
(56:40) Okay That's what I want I want that more than anything I also want it but for that they have to be alive Yeah Riven
(56:46) Riven does that mean that I have some moral obligation How much how much treasure should I give Riven I give you
(56:52) a chance to support them You got to go to the next support How much is that It that that's a trivial issue which we can
(56:57) talk about a dollar Do you agree that we should support 50 cents No that you haven't provided me an a yet for why If
(57:04) you don't agree that we should support them then what's the point of talking about the details of how we should support them Angie because we need to start with an I hate to do this but
(57:10) because we have so many questions gentlemen we need to start with an we're going to go to the next question Hey uh Ren congrats first on joining the church
(57:17) Um I just have a quick disambiguation question for you Are you would you make the argument that your ex Jesus of
(57:23) Romans 9 through11 um would be supported by the majority of Petristic sources or even the majority of modern biblical
(57:29) scholarship outside of dispensational circles and if so could you elucidate on that Uh well as said I when when I went
(57:36) when I talked about it when I went through my script I appealed to uh some uh very very important figures in early
(57:41) church history uh as Orthodox Christians I'm sure Andrew also knows that St John Chroasum is an ex extremely respected
(57:48) figure in terms of his homalies He the one who wrote a homaly against the Jews written Yes Exactly Exactly that one
(57:54) Exactly that one Uh do you know what he says in his homaly on Romans 11 He says if you want to cherrypick it I wouldn't
(58:00) advise it Well it's not cherry advise it It's not cherrypicking because what he says is that is that what St Paul says
(58:05) about the Jews being grafted back in it will come true And he says if it has not happened yet then you then uh you must
(58:13) be you must be sure that it is bound to happen I want to point out here that St
(58:18) John Chrisman is talking in the 4th century long after the fall of the second temple So this also answers the
(58:24) other question here Those are the Jews that exist here today The rabbinic Jews by tradition Another point uh St Kurill
(58:32) of Alexandria St Augustine supports it very very well He says that their
(58:37) existence is uh basically a proof of God's work and that they will be eventually reconciled and as said uh
(58:44) late metropolitan kalistas were also very much he even goes further I don't even say this he goes further and says
(58:49) they are still God's chosen people and also says that you shouldn't fall into
(58:54) heresy by spreading around any of the false gospel that inside of this they
(59:00) are blaspheming the holy spirit by what by denying the divinity of Christ this
(59:05) is also stated riven You leave all of this out for the Hang on Let me finish man I didn't interrupt you once Sure Go
(59:10) ahead I'm sorry So what you do So what you do here right is you creating again these false dialectics by cherrypicking
(59:17) The truth of the matter is is that even if we were to grant everything you just said as being true and that modern
(59:23) rabbis are the spiritual successor one way or the other or the bloodline successors that Paul is talking about
(59:28) here I'm still willing to grant it It still doesn't give an aught for why we must support Zionism a political
(59:34) ideology which includes secular and religious Jews It doesn't I want to establish one thing here which is very
(59:39) very curious because you seem to object to it but don't really address it When I site uh Metropolitan Kalisto Square Yeah
(59:45) you just said he also said this or something like that No I was talking about St John Okay Do you acknowledge that uh hierarchs like him in orthodoxy
(59:53) in Greek orthodoxy respected around the world would naturally use words such as
(59:58) that we should have love and no disrespect toward the Jewish people the uh people of Israel because they are
(1:00:04) still beloved and they are still God's chosen people Do you agree that this is a normal Yeah it's it well it's normal
(1:00:10) enough for um for people in higher up orthodox positions to say that we should love basically every chosen people
(1:00:17) Andrew people Yes But what does he mean by that Does he mean chosen people Do
(1:00:22) you think that he means what they mean by what he means by chosen people is they have extra love over Orthodox
(1:00:28) Christians and they have special Jew blood Do you think that that's what he think he means I hate to say this but we do have we have to go to the next
(1:00:33) question just because we've we've gotten deep here Um a big part of your argument was
(1:00:40) saying something about the um support of the of the state of Israel is because if they didn't have a state they wouldn't
(1:00:46) be able to continue their existence Did the Israel did Jews exist before the establishment of the state of Israel
(1:00:52) Yeah but I'm I'm clearly talking about uh the Jews who are currently in the region If they fell and if they no
(1:00:58) longer had the protection of their state they would probably seize existing because that's what the other side
(1:01:04) promises We have Jews around the world still who are outside of Israel How were the people there in order to establish a
(1:01:10) state in the first place Well you have people who lived there You have people who traveled there who uh went from
(1:01:15) around the world there right So how does it logically follow that they're unable to continue their people
(1:01:22) without their people I don't understand the question You're saying if they lived in all these other countries I understand that I don't understand I
(1:01:28) don't understand the issue here They specifically went there the Zionist movement was specifically about how uh
(1:01:33) living as a Jew in these different countries throughout history has been very difficult as we can all know and
(1:01:38) see So so when they so so when they went there they wanted to establish a state where they can finally live in peace
(1:01:44) without being at the mercy of others Now you have a large Jewish population in Israel If Israel suddenly fell to fell
(1:01:50) today then the Jewish population that is there would be eradicated by the Islamists in the region Now there would
(1:01:57) still be there would still be Jews left on the other side of the world But that doesn't really take away from the fact
(1:02:03) the state is take away from the fact that logically follows what I'm trying to say Yeah I can I can respond to this
(1:02:09) as well very quickly because Rivven's not going to He just this short circuited him So the question was
(1:02:14) actually a good question The question was "Wait a second Didn't Jews exist before there was an Israel So how is it
(1:02:20) that even if Israel wasn't there Jews would just stop existing That makes no sense." Great question right Seems like
(1:02:26) it's a performative contradiction in his worldview which is why he doesn't want to address it Here's the truth right And
(1:02:31) nobody's calling for there to not be a state of Israel by the way But if we were to hypothetically even say that
(1:02:36) Israel was um destroyed and Jews again had to disperse or were scattered that
(1:02:42) doesn't mean that they would be uh Jews themselves would be destroyed They would go back to other nations where they were
(1:02:48) before Now uh here's the issue I was actually answering your question but if you let me speak without trying to
(1:02:54) interject every second I would actually answer your question properly because I understand the question that you asked The question you asked is "Weren't Jews
(1:03:01) around before?" uh didn't so weren't they around before How were they able to establish this this this land Did their
(1:03:08) existence really depend on the land If the land is destroyed uh does that really mean they would all go extinct
(1:03:13) and so on Here's the issue You have a significant part of the Jewish population that currently lives in the land of Israel If the land of Israel
(1:03:19) would be destroyed a significant part of the Jewish population would be eradicated That means a small amount of
(1:03:26) Jewish people who are outside of Israel would of course still be left as the the amount of those who survive the massacre
(1:03:33) that would unfold which Andrew Wilson here never actually acknowledges uh
(1:03:38) would of course survive and run away But do you really how is it how is it a reasonable or proper point to simply
(1:03:46) allow for that to happen instead of protecting those people when it is so clear is so clear the other side wants
(1:03:53) to eradicate them The majority of Jews don't live in Israel Raven what does it matter Because you just said that it
(1:03:59) would take out a substantial port of the population The majority it's not even the majority of the population That's
(1:04:05) the point Nobody's calling for Israel to get wiped out at all All I'm saying is that there's no ought for Christians to
(1:04:12) support a nation that wants to to have Antichrist by at least 30% by your own
(1:04:17) admission It depends on their numbers That's very very funny What We'll give you one last follow up then we're going to go to the next question Yeah you you
(1:04:24) made a false statement and then I'll sit But you made a false statement Neither Paul nor St Johnum places the Jewish
(1:04:32) people higher than any other non-Christian Um yes you did Raven No no
(1:04:37) no no Yes All right Hold on We got We got to get You never said they are more special than Orthodox Yes you did You
(1:04:43) said yes You let me speak dude But don't lie I never said they are more important than Orthodox Christians That's what I
(1:04:49) was saying You said God loved them more because he keeps insisting that I said that You said God loved them more I
(1:04:54) asked you point blank You said yes Andrew I'm clarifying it for you here right now I never said and I will never
(1:04:59) say that God especially loves the Jewish people more than Orthodox Christians I never said that What is what I clearly
(1:05:06) said And you can you can go back and listen to this again and again Yes we can I can make a clip I can make a
(1:05:11) compilation out of this for you I said again and again that they are more beloved especially beloved among the
(1:05:16) non-Christians Remember when I asked they die or did I not say that Do you remember when I asked you I want to go to the next especially more beloved than
(1:05:23) the other non-Christians I want to go to the next question I want to go to the next question just because
(1:05:29) Okay just real quick I see that you have your references there Both of you guys
(1:05:34) have made Sorry got to eat it Both of you guys have made quite a few claims
(1:05:39) Yeah both sides And some of them got to be fraudulent because of course they contradict each other So I see
(1:05:46) references from you I don't see a single reference from you All I hear are your
(1:05:52) claims Mhm And I have no sources to go Yeah You remember how I cited in the debate the references So you you can go
(1:05:59) back and hang on Let me I'll answer the question Right I did cite the references Just because I don't put them up in a
(1:06:05) PowerPoint presentation for the purposes for the purposes of time doesn't mean I didn't verbally cite them But most of my
(1:06:12) claims that I'm making he agrees with He agrees that there's at least a large
(1:06:18) amount at least by his admission of Jews inside of Israel up to 30% who want to name antichrist I gave four logical
(1:06:25) arguments What references should I give you for logical arguments except me Any
(1:06:30) beyond you Because I do not have What's a logical argument dude I remember maybe one reference Do I go to an expert of
(1:06:37) logic to ask them for a logical argument or can I make logical arguments You cited like one person this entire time
(1:06:42) That's it That's all you've given us I cited my own logic to be able to logic
(1:06:48) Are you saying that we should only believe you as the supreme authority Believe me about course man What am I
(1:06:54) claiming Because what am I sources Yeah Do you do you know what Tell me this What's an argument What's a logical
(1:07:00) argument Well you still have not yet given what's a logical argument Answer my question If you give a logical
(1:07:07) argument which is steps from one to the next to the next should be verified
(1:07:12) Who's the source of the logical argument At this point it's you making it up And isn't it always the source that somebody
(1:07:17) is making a logical argument but because it's a mathematical expression you can falsify arguments That's why they're
(1:07:24) called arguments They're falsifiable uh or they're provable That's why you give sources Sources for an logical argument
(1:07:32) that I made Yes we're you very funny In case you had a different question Okay
(1:07:37) I'll tell you one second Sorry folks Hold on Hey source Premise one me Premise two me Premise three me
(1:07:43) Conclusion also me Now the great thing about that you can falsify them with
(1:07:48) logic You know what I find very funny here Source Andrew claims Do you have a source for that Andrew claims on one
(1:07:55) hand that I agree with pretty much everything he said Yet during this entire night during this entire debate he claimed at least four times that I
(1:08:01) argued that uh Jews are more beloved than Orthodox Christians which I never ever said Actually he's just
(1:08:09) No I I didn't I didn't I never ever said that Jews are more beloved than Orthodox Christians Do you have a question for a
(1:08:15) prophet as well Show me where we'll jump We'll jump We'll jump
(1:08:21) to the next question
(1:08:27) Hello So I have a question for Andrew I'm not familiar with you personally So it's been interesting hearing your um
(1:08:34) trains of thoughts However I've heard a lot of straw man attacks tonight against magic Jew blood feigned outrage about how much money for your kids you have to
(1:08:41) give up to Jews who reject Jesus and claims about protecting an ethnic group of people's existence meaning supporting
(1:08:46) a blasphemous antichrist None of which were brought up by AP or logically or intrinsically follow Meanwhile
(1:08:52) biblically we see God himself set up and set apart Israel for his glory And we see open your mouth for the mute for the
(1:08:58) rights of those who are destitute Open your mouth judge righteously defend the rights of the poor and needy Proverbs 31:8-9 So my question is based on these
(1:09:05) things if you believe in the sanctity of the lives God created how can you attack the primary group who is speaking up for
(1:09:11) their preservation when the things that you claim such as ushering in the antichrist of biblical prophecy does not
(1:09:17) logically follow Yeah So first of all my job here tonight is to make logical
(1:09:23) arguments as to whether or not there's an ought or an ought not What if Christians must they have some moral
(1:09:29) obligation to support a political ideology right I granted AP's definition
(1:09:36) I've been very charitable I granted his definitions I've granted his numbers I've granted everything and showed that
(1:09:41) they still don't falsify the actual position The reason I utilize the idea of magic Jew blood is so that he could
(1:09:48) say yes this is above orthodox Christians Do you ma'am do you believe that Israel is the
(1:09:54) church Do you believe the church is Israel I don't know how that's relevant to support group Can you answer my
(1:10:00) question Thank you It's not answer about supporting the light of ethnic group So that is irrelevant Did I
(1:10:07) answer your Did I answer your question I answered it Yes I did Can you answer mine Is Israel the church
(1:10:13) I believe that the church that is with Christ are the branches that have been
(1:10:19) grafted on to the naturalborn olive tree AP though in his religious belief and in
(1:10:24) mine we believe that the church is the Israel which is being referenced He
(1:10:30) believes that too That's part that's part of his fa hang on hang on That's part of his faith So when I'm making so
(1:10:36) when I hang on let me finish my point What does not exclusively mean It means
(1:10:42) also yes I do but means yes I do but a qualifier great but he does all believe
(1:10:48) that all Christians believe that can finish let me clarify one thing here for you hold on one second I do want to I do
(1:10:53) want to give stop filibustering me let me let me finish the damn point so anyway back to this by his own by his
(1:11:01) own faith he believes that Israel is a new church me and you are talking past each other me and AP are not I'm
(1:11:07) falsifying his direct ideology not trying to falsify whatever yours You're making a false uh Okay then who's the
(1:11:14) church Here here is the issue Andrew Do you acknowledge Do you acknowledge that according to Romans 9 through11 And
(1:11:20) according to Orthodox teachings there are two Israels
(1:11:25) here One would be the natural Israel and one is the spiritual or also called the true Israel Do you acknowledge this Um
(1:11:32) well let's uh let's define our terms real quick So do you acknowledge that there are two Israel The natural Israel
(1:11:38) and the spiritual Israel Yeah So if they're saying what is well what is natural Israel It's right in the scripture I tell you what the Orthodox
(1:11:44) church position is This is the Orthodox church position What is it What is natural Israel We find it in the Orthodox study Bible The natural Israel
(1:11:51) are those who are of the tradition of the Jews and the descendants of the Jews
(1:11:56) for their forefathers who may or may not have accepted Christ Whereas the
(1:12:02) spiritual Israel are those who have accepted Christ and who are the church
(1:12:08) There are two Israel Now I understand two Israel Do you acknowledge that there are two Israel Yeah Yeah So what which
(1:12:14) one were we talking about What question I ask her Who's the church Do you acknowledge Andrew that there are two
(1:12:20) Even if I grant it Who's the church Can you answer my question Who's the church Red Van can you answer my question Do
(1:12:26) you acknowledge Okay There are two Israel Who's the church There is two Israel
(1:12:32) Fantastic So when it talks about when it talks about them being enemies for the
(1:12:37) gospel's sake but still beloved by their forefathers which Israel is this Andrew So who's the Okay I answered your
(1:12:43) question Answer that question Which is the question again promise that you be fair Andrew did answer one I do want
(1:12:49) Sure Go ahead Sure When Paul talks about how they are enemies for the gospel's sake but they are beloved for their
(1:12:55) forefather's sake Which Israel is he talking about Um well in in this case
(1:13:01) I'd say the natural Thank you And that's the one that this promise is about So hang on So who's the church Say on So
(1:13:07) who's the church Israel The the church is Israel Yes And so when
(1:13:12) I told her that you believe that the church is Israel I was accurate Right This is what just answer the question Uh
(1:13:20) yeah but that's not holy Had to do all of this to get the answer from you
(1:13:25) That's not relevant to the issue because talking about the natural Israel It is relevant He was not referencing natural
(1:13:31) Israel Clearly she clearly mentioned the natural Israel That's what we were talking about No she I I told her that
(1:13:37) we're referencing until church until just a getting answers out of you is like
(1:13:44) pulling teeth We have we have a question that there's an we have a question for you AP Sure Go ahead So Andrew mentioned
(1:13:51) earlier that he believes the religious Jews are the ones who reject Jesus but I wanted to get your viewpoint on this
(1:13:57) since you guys clearly differ on some things Would you agree with him that the religious Jews are those that reject Jesus or instead those that actually
(1:14:03) accept him Sorry um I didn't understand the whole distinction So uh Andrew put forward the idea that religious Jews
(1:14:09) reject Jesus I'm asking you if you would agree with that position or if you would instead believe that the religious Jews
(1:14:15) are those that do follow Jesus Thank you So um all those who are Jews all those
(1:14:21) who are Jews by flesh all those who are Jews by tradition who reject Christ
(1:14:27) would be considered um the Jews and of the natural branches of Israel That is
(1:14:33) literally what uh Paul says And then there are also those who he says not all
(1:14:38) are Israel Uh the true Israel are then those who accept Christ So this is where the diversion comes in And by the way he
(1:14:45) is trying to make it look like this is just orthodox uh theology It's not It's it's literally in the Bible This
(1:14:51) Protestants teach the same thing Catholics teach the same thing Orthodox teach the same thing because it is in the Bible He didn't even just he only
(1:14:58) just acknowledged he only just acknowledged that it might be true that Israel is also the natural Israel You
(1:15:04) know the people of it from the view of you Ren I will I do want to jump I do
(1:15:09) want to jump to the next question as a on this one for a while Yeah Your view depends on you right now It doesn't
(1:15:15) depend on me Your view depends on specifically right now I need to do this folks but so I have a brief
(1:15:22) uh statement uh and then a question So uh I'm a seminarian in a in the reformed
(1:15:30) tradition almost or reformed the reformed tradition universally rejects
(1:15:36) dispensationalism Yeah And and many of the other sort of main Protestant groups
(1:15:41) It's mostly uh restorationists that accept that that that hold that position But
(1:15:48) um that's true It's small It's like 20% of a of a of like Yeah it's like 20% who
(1:15:53) accepts dispensationalism Yeah I was just saying that you characterized Protestants when it
(1:15:59) is not universal to Protestantism That's true But look I wasn't being real quick
(1:16:04) my so in in the 70s the United States sent uh money and weapons to the Taliban
(1:16:13) in the effort to fight the Soviet Union Yeah Today
(1:16:19) [Music] the Israeli government sends or money to support
(1:16:25) dispensationalists in the US Yes Does the US support the political aims
(1:16:33) of a caliphate of the Taliban just because they send them money They have
(1:16:38) So that I mean they actually have supported um what you would consider you
(1:16:44) know like if we're talking about if we're talking about al-Qaeda things like this the US has actually supported
(1:16:50) groups like this I would say though from a Christian perspective we would say they ought not do that right They ought
(1:16:58) not do that That's the whole point right I think you misunderstand my question or
(1:17:03) my question Um the support of a group or
(1:17:11) organization by a government Yeah is almost not is almost never because of
(1:17:16) some you know the phil philosophical or theological alignment I totally agree It
(1:17:22) is pragmatic I think it is I think that your assertion that you know or your
(1:17:28) your assertion that Israel is there to bring about the Antichrist because they support ridiculous dispensationalist
(1:17:35) nonsense um in the United States is a bridge too
(1:17:40) far in that they're supporting them because they bring you know because they
(1:17:46) uh support and bring people to support and uh positively you know tow the
(1:17:54) Israel state Then why do they say why do they make the claim that they're essentially biblical accelerationists
(1:18:01) Because they're trying to get biblical accelerationists to support them right
(1:18:06) But that doesn't that's that doesn't mean that they're biblical acceleration biblical accelerationism ends in uh
(1:18:14) stupidity But and and and antichrist right Antichrist Yeah The end of the
(1:18:20) world If you if you believe that that's that esquetology is true but if it's not it just means ridiculous Yes but we do
(1:18:27) believe that that esquetology is true that there will be an antichrist right Well there is antichrists But
(1:18:35) Yeah But I'm talking you Yeah I understand what you're saying But by that by the same uh definition of
(1:18:41) antichrist the Jewish state itself is antichrist because it's not openly supporting Christ the Israel the uh the
(1:18:48) the enemies of Israel are antichrist because they are openly against Christ It's almost like we should not support
(1:18:54) either of them Wow Great Yes
(1:19:00) Yeah Cool Let the Christians in the Middle East die We can support Christians in the Middle East We can
(1:19:06) even get Christians in the Middle East We're letting them die And we don't have to support Muslims or Jews to do it
(1:19:11) You're letting them die You're not letting them die literally letting the Christians in the Middle East die by
(1:19:17) refusing to support the only state in the Middle East where Christianity is thriving According to the Christian
(1:19:23) organization Open Doors International which tracks Christians and their oppression across the world Andrew I
(1:19:29) want to show you one 1.8% I want to show you this I have a list here of uh World Watch List published by
(1:19:36) Open Doors International Open Doors International tracks the oppression of Christians around the world Yeah it uh
(1:19:42) the entire Middle East is is marked here Where do you think Israel ranks on this list of it's way higher than a lot of
(1:19:48) the Muslim nations Where do you think it ranks in terms in terms of oppression Where Where do you think let's just say it's like number
(1:19:55) eight zillion who cares Yeah it's nowhere on the list because because among all the countries in the Middle
(1:20:00) East where Christians are brutally oppressed and which have an a history of oppressing Christians destroying
(1:20:06) Christian sites diminishing Christianity Lebanon was taken over as a Christian country has been turned into a Muslim
(1:20:12) country where Christians are losing their rights day by day You're not arguing with a Muslim Israel is the only
(1:20:18) nation that defends the rights of Christians and you don't give a about them You're letting them die
(1:20:23) opinion So first of all let me just I got to respond to that one First of all inside of Israel right what is it 1% or
(1:20:31) under 2% of who are actually Christians You think that we can't remove them from
(1:20:36) that We can We definitely can By the way hang on By the way by the way
(1:20:42) can I finish bro You don't want them to live there Why Why am I not allowed to finish ever Stop filibustering me dummy
(1:20:48) So real quick we can assist we can assist Christians around the world and
(1:20:54) have ton we have and so have tons of organizations which have assisted
(1:21:00) Christians around the world by not supporting Muslims or Israel You can do
(1:21:05) both It's a bifurcation to claim we must do one Why Because we have great reasons
(1:21:11) biblical reasons to not support a state which wants to usher an antichrist which protects Christians and protects
(1:21:17) Christians We can protect Christians too Raven are we doing it Yeah we protect here What do you mean We are not
(1:21:23) protecting the Christians in the Middle East They are dying Your fellow Orthodox Christians are dying And do you think
(1:21:28) that the United States is hindering programs from people inside the United States to assist in the removal of
(1:21:33) Orthodox Christians from those areas No The truth is why would they do that Right now Christians in Palestine aren't
(1:21:39) even allowed to leave Palestine are they Yes they actually are They actually are Oh they are Yes they actually are Okay
(1:21:44) So they're literally working in Israel right now Population of Gaza the Christian population of Gaza is below
(1:21:50) 1,000 Who lets them go Because of the Palestinian Who lets them go Israel Israel Okay great So you're saying what
(1:21:56) you're saying to me then is that we can take Christians out of Israel Why would
(1:22:01) you want to And we can take Christians out of Muslim nations The Christians are happy in Israel According to the latest
(1:22:07) poll 84% of Christians say they are satisfied with life in Palestine Are they are they satisfied They would be
(1:22:13) happier as well if Israel was in charge Are they satisfied right now No they are not because Muslims are in charge No they're not Because terrorists are in
(1:22:18) charge But why would they be happy on the terrorism Here's the thing Why can you tell me why it is that I have an
(1:22:24) obligation some obligation to protect Jewish interest for the Jewish state
(1:22:29) instead of the Christian interests Well let's give Amy a chance and then we really do we have to if you if you as a
(1:22:35) Christian do not care about the well-being of Christians in the Middle East or the wellbe I just said we should help the Jews on the brink of
(1:22:41) extermination I guess that's your problem and deal with it when you are okay I guess if all you care about is
(1:22:47) placing Jews above everybody else then I guess I guess if we're going to straw man each other straw man once again we
(1:22:54) have to move to the next question Okay first of all thank you so much for doing this in humble little Asheville and
(1:22:59) thank you for taking my question Somebody uh ahead of me actually made the point that I wanted to make about
(1:23:04) well Jews existed prior to Israel but I didn't want to look like I punked out and step out of line So I reformulated
(1:23:11) my question to address Andrew's argument uh that uh I think Josh thought went too
(1:23:17) far but then the person right in front of me just so I'm going to try to formulate it this way because I agree Christians shouldn't support an ideology
(1:23:25) that may conflict with Christianity wholeheartedly and is growing But the uh
(1:23:30) the pragmatic thing that of course I'll lose cuz I'm trying to be pragmatic but
(1:23:35) uh 30 to 36% of people in the United States are socialist uh support
(1:23:41) socialism XYZ The United States government has given tens upon tens of millions of dollars to socialist causes
(1:23:47) Therefore should we support America because America wants to start a socialist revolution by that Well here's
(1:23:53) here's the thing I would never make an ought claim right that Christians would
(1:23:58) have to support United States endeavors because it's the United States I would
(1:24:03) never make that a claim He's making the claim we must support Israel because
(1:24:08) they're Jews That's literally his ought claim Two completely different paradigms Here's the issue Andrew Here's the issue
(1:24:15) This is all I can do in terms of response I'm just like on my third uh reformulation but I appreciate it
(1:24:20) gentlemen Thank you so much We have to go to the next question because we're going to do rapid fire with these last guys And should um I slightly wanted to
(1:24:26) come back to a question that this young man you brought it up um a couple minutes ago but you were saying how it's
(1:24:33) safer for Christians to live in Israel but Israel has been killing 3% of
(1:24:40) the Christian population in Gaza recently You mentioned earlier in your opening argument that the idea of
(1:24:46) Zionism is to coexist with one another And maybe Theodore Herzel you know didn't understand the idea of coexistence but there's been plenty of
(1:24:52) paramilitary groups that have been attacking you know during this region during you know the
(1:24:59) original faser Um you said you weren't going to reiterate propaganda but
(1:25:05) Amin was just one man You know what I'm referring to Now here's the issue Um you are once
(1:25:12) again uh influenced by by the propaganda which I see which is why I brought this up to Andrew Wilson and said that uh if
(1:25:20) we have a list tracked by a Christian organization do you trust your fellow Christians Open Doors International is a
(1:25:25) Christian organization which tracks oppression of Christians around the world According to their data despite
(1:25:31) the fact that they report on every single instance of Christian oppression even in Israel if it happens Israel is
(1:25:37) not listed among the countries where there is Christian oppression So if if people are dying in the middle of a war
(1:25:44) if people are dying in the middle of of a war then does that really mean that that it is Israel that is oppressing
(1:25:50) them No they are in the middle of a war Do you know how many Christians died in this war so far Why did Israel support
(1:25:55) Hamas What Why did Israel support Hamas Why did
(1:26:01) Israel support Hamas What are you talking about Is this new to you No it's not new to me Israel did support the the
(1:26:08) forerunners of Hamas before Hamas came into existence because they thought that this was a charity organization which
(1:26:14) they marked themselves as It then turned into a terrorist organization The only thing that happened afterwards is that
(1:26:19) Netanyahu came up with this brilliant policy for which he has been heavily criticized where he said if Qatar wants
(1:26:25) to send funds to Hamas I will just allow the funds to reach Hamas because this could prevent them from violently
(1:26:31) attacking us That's the only capacity That's the only capacity to which Israel has supported Hamas If you want to rely
(1:26:38) on lies and don't want to listen to the truth here I'm not sure what to tell you
(1:26:46) Uh good evening Thank you guys for coming Uh quickly to the other two gentlemen about uh the quickly about the
(1:26:53) other two gentlemen that talked about um like if if a government supports uh like a
(1:27:01) foreign organization that means that they believe in what the organization is saying Not that we should support it but I don't think it's fair to claim that
(1:27:09) Israel supports like the whole messianic like ideology of the temple organization but America didn't support
(1:27:17) or doesn't believe in like like they just recently admitted that they were supporting like Bam al-Shabaab all these
(1:27:23) I don't think they believe that they should establish like America should establish like caliphates in these
(1:27:29) little areas like based off of these organizations Um that's my question which is not it's not like a big uh
(1:27:35) disagree What's the question though Like uh do you think it's fair to assume uh
(1:27:41) that Israel supports the messianic movement if other governments like America supported like al-Shabaab and
(1:27:46) these other Islamic the government's becoming the Messianic movement in Israel that's becoming that So it's
(1:27:51) growing by leaps and bounds Benjamin Netanyahu had to get in good They had to get good in good with these people
(1:27:57) politically So the truth of the matter is is like if if you look at it that organization is growing to become the
(1:28:03) government that's literally growing to become it He can he can cope about it but he'll have to admit it's been
(1:28:09) growing not shrinking I don't want to thank you for the response and then just a quick question to you Uh do you okay
(1:28:15) so yeah you say that Israel is like important in supporting Christians in Israel but how about like abroad Israel
(1:28:20) supported uh many dictators that have persecuted Christians like in Nicaragua for example funded uh 90% of their uh
(1:28:27) their military to kill 50,000 Nicaraguans which there could be Christians in that group and Angola they
(1:28:34) did the same thing by supporting three uh of the rebel groups fighting in the country by switching sides each time and
(1:28:40) uh increasing the violence against Christians This is apparent everywhere Even in my uh home country of Aratria
(1:28:45) pushing faster sorry even in my home country of Aratria Israel support trained a bunch of the commandos not
(1:28:51) only that they end up oh that do you think uh wait with this uh information
(1:28:57) do you think um that Israel you think that Christians should still support Israel despite what you're basically
(1:29:03) asking me is is uh because Israel makes uh makes certain mistakes in the past does this mean uh we should we should
(1:29:09) support Israel I would I would just ask the same question to make the very make a very similar point about America America did a lot of pretty bad things
(1:29:16) in the in the past in pretty messed up things Does that mean that America is altogether a bad nation Does that mean
(1:29:22) America is undeserving of our support and solidarity No Israel just as well may have done in the past certain things
(1:29:28) that are unacceptable Does that mean Israel is undeserving of our support and our help No Go to the back Sorry we've
(1:29:34) already gone over time for the Q&A So I do want to jump into the actual closings You have three minutes for each speaker starting with Apostate Prophet The floor
() 
(1:29:41) is all yours Yes So um this did go a little bit as I uh thought it would go
(1:29:47) which is that um much of what I brought up in my opening speech much of the
(1:29:52) argument has been left unressed by my opponent Andrew Wilson whereas uh I
(1:29:58) answered to very much every single thing that he brought up in one way or another He didn't like my responses but uh but
(1:30:04) that's just his issue Um he doesn't like it when he gets responses that don't make sense to him Um he didn't answer my
(1:30:11) issues about uh the threats that face the world with uh Israel going extinct
(1:30:17) I'm an ex-Muslim I grew up in an environment and in a system where people preach day and night that if the Jews
(1:30:25) who are the enemies are defeated then the Christians are next There is a saying in the Middle East that goes uh
(1:30:31) first the Saturday people then the Sunday people I'm not joking Don't trust
(1:30:36) me Go online and Google the phrase okay Use Google Google the phrase first the
(1:30:41) Saturday people then the Sunday people You will be shocked by what you will find out because what you will find out
(1:30:46) is that this is a common sentiment in the Middle East that once the Muslims are done with the Jews they would go to
(1:30:52) the Christians and oppress them as well Because Islam is not a religion that is about coexistence It is a religion about
(1:30:58) uh dominating and massacring populations I am an ex-Muslim I have the death
(1:31:03) penalty on me for leaving Islam Uh I know exactly how Muslims think how they feel If Israel were to fall the euphoric
(1:31:12) rise of Muslims to once again reestablish this sick order which was only by the way stopped by Christian
(1:31:19) western people by force It will rise again and it will threaten the entire
(1:31:24) region and it will it will threaten Christians as well Not supporting Israel here in this case because some people
(1:31:30) are paranoid about Jews and about Zionism and all that is supporting the
(1:31:36) Islamists who want to take over The very people who are fighting against Israel
(1:31:41) say very openly I gave you the sources that once they are done with the Jews
(1:31:47) then the next goal will be to reestablish the caliphate and start from there You think this is just some uh you
(1:31:53) know a possibility This is what they are aiming for Why in the world would anybody support that by refusing to help
(1:32:03) those who are fighting against that Israel If you don't care about Jews if you don't care about the Bible if you
(1:32:09) don't care about God if you don't care about Paul care about a little bit of logic care about the the Christians
(1:32:15) there don't allow the dam that is preventing the flood from coming in to
(1:32:21) break support those people that are holding back the masses of barbarians
(1:32:28) that not only want the extermination of Jews that people are obsessed with but also the extermination of all the other
(1:32:34) people in the region You are allowing them into your countries You're allowing them to rape your people and now you're
(1:32:41) also allowing them to defeat the only ones who actually have the balls to stand against them Good job Thank you
(1:32:46) very much for that closing We'll kick it over to Andrew for his three-minute closing as Yes So I think that that's a really effective closing argument
() 
(1:32:53) against a Muslim but the thing is is that I'm not a Muslim and I am not a
(1:32:58) supporter of Islam in any capacity And he ends it with a false binary Again if
(1:33:03) you Andrew don't support Israel that means you support Islam Boy that's genius I haven't heard that from every
(1:33:09) political party since I was a kid If you don't support us you support the death of the elderly If you don't support us
(1:33:15) you support abortion If you don't support us you support A B and C Totally false dialectics false binaries and lies
(1:33:23) Here's the truth right The truth is is that the West is the ones who already enable enable the fact that Islam can't
(1:33:30) spread The West is the fact that's already doing this by his own admission We must support Israel Why Because
(1:33:37) they're the ones who are stopping this That means the West is necessary in a component to stopping this So let's
(1:33:42) assume for a second that every single Jewish person tomorrow left Israel just packed their bags and they left and all
(1:33:49) the Christians moved in instead because they have a lot of attachment to the Holy Land Are you saying that their interest wouldn't be preserved there by
(1:33:56) them also against Islam Of course it would That's what makes this a false binary choice You don't have to support
(1:34:03) either I don't need to support Islam and I don't need to support a Jewish ethnostate either a rid that want has
(1:34:10) prophecies for Antichrist it's trying to fulfill I don't need to support either Totally unnecessary for me to support
(1:34:16) either with my tax dollars Totally unnecessary for me to support either in order to stop Islam By the way I just am
(1:34:23) going to point out the historic standard Israel hasn't been along around for very long The reestablished nation of Israel
(1:34:29) and the West has been kicking the out of Muslims for about a thousand years Just want to point that out About
(1:34:36) a thousand years kicking the total out of uh Islamics all all over the
(1:34:41) place when it comes to them spreading their ideology This includes when they were enroaching in Europe which they did
(1:34:46) they got thrown out of there right I would say the destabilizing agent inside the Middle East You could make the argument could be Israel for why there's
(1:34:53) so many of these displaced Muslim refugees moving into Western nations to begin with You can easily make that
(1:35:00) argument Now would I I don't even think that's necessary Maybe that is a step too far But the point is is that it
(1:35:06) still is a false binary choice And that's all he gives you Never ever trust
(1:35:11) the argument of a person who says if you don't support this that means you support that That's pure rhetoric It's
(1:35:18) illogical It's facious Every argument from Ridban was facial He said he addressed my arguments I wrote them
(1:35:24) premise form Never addressed a single argument ever When I asked him and I want you to take this last thing away
(1:35:31) with my closing I asked Rivven point blank "Do you think that we should support the nation of Israel even
(1:35:36) knowing that 30% of the population there and growing right wants Antichrist?" And
(1:35:42) his answer point blank and I'll clip it and put it out for those who don't believe me was yes Unequivocally yes
(1:35:49) Well I have a different point of view No I'm not going in any capacity to support
(1:35:56) Antichrist or Islam I can have my cake and eat it too So that's it We'll
(1:36:02) conclude at least We appreciate you gentlemen Thank you very much Give him a round of applause folks
