(0:00) are you a prophet yes okay and so both of you are prophets for sure and so can
(0:05) you foresee future events yes sometimes refute it you can't refute it excuse me
(0:11) the scriptures say he divided the Nations that's RAC within itself so you
(0:17) mean to tell me that the ideology that you're spewing is the same thing that the white colonizers are spewing you're
(0:25) actually the racist you would first have to prove that you're a prophet based off of swi that's what it says if you were a
(0:32) prophet you should have known that and predicted it beforehand and written it down and then he could demonstrate the
(0:37) proof of it let's just read the book of Revelation 2 and 26 and he that
(0:44) overcometh and keepeth my Works unto the end to him will I give power over the
(0:49) nation but Romans 2:29 but a Jew is one inwardly and circumcision is a matter of
(0:56) the Heart by the spirit not by the letter we can go verse for verse all day
(1:02) [Laughter] long uh welcome to no fugazi podcast
(1:08) Andrew Wilson goad and introduce yourself to the uh to the chat man yeah my name is Andrew Wilson I'm the host of The
(1:14) Crucible I'm a political analyst political saturnist I do debates all over the world I appreciate you uh
(1:20) letting me come in I did um but so I I didn't even know this uh the stream was
(1:25) happening but um somebody came over said I I should probably jump on so I've been kind of patient L listening there's a
(1:31) bunch of things I don't actually understand here maybe you can give me some clarification on the first is um I
(1:37) mean forgive me if I'm wrong about this but I honestly don't think anybody gives a [ __ ] if blacks segregate I don't I
(1:43) don't think they care at all like who who would I mean they they don't they like literally don't care
(1:49) who that is AR cares right I got you gorilla I'll explain to him so yeah so
(1:55) currently right now um uh Andrew Wilson we got three Hebrew Israelites and some of the things that like my
(2:03) debate you know my arguments with them is not about the separation and stuff like that or the segregation um if black
(2:10) separate has nothing to do with that my debate with them which they really can't
(2:15) seem to give me a solid answer on um is this it's all about the racist so they
(2:23) believe in that uh God is going to well only the Hebrew Israel ites is going to
(2:31) be at the top of the hierarchy in heaven this is what they believe in this is what they explain to me everyone else
(2:37) that's makes makes it to Heaven they're going to be below the Hebrew Israelites the only reason why the Hebrew
(2:44) Israelites is going to be above everyone else in heaven is because of the ethnicity is because of their race so my
(2:51) argument was is God a racist all of them confirmed and said yes God is a
(2:57) racist so it's the DNA chosen people thing DNA chosen people thing yeah not a
(3:02) DNA thing but there is a chosen people that God chose well is it a mental state
(3:08) or is it a physical component which makes you the chosen people meaning is
(3:13) it biological or is it just a status of mental capacity a mental state like for
(3:19) instance if a Christian says I believe Jesus Christ died on the cross um this is a mental state right so is it are we
(3:26) talking about yeah so are we talking about a biological State yeah can I read descrip like like essentially there's a
(3:33) there's a biological prerequisite to be in that be in that upper echon there's a
(3:39) it's a prere it's not it's not an absolute qualification prerequisite but you understand that there's immediately
(3:46) something which is fallacious which is happening here just by the very argument of biology nobody at the time that any
(3:53) of the Old Testament was written or the New Testament had any understanding of DNA no conception ization of this
(4:00) whatsoever they only have the conceptualization of house lineage but the idea of blood itself um being in
(4:09) some way passed down and it's through that blood that you will receive x uh
(4:14) that wasn't the actual conceptualization it was it was from house well that's what we're talking about we're still
(4:19) talking about the house of Israel it's it's still what we're talking about what I'm asking is what makes you up that house so one second when you when you
(4:26) say blood the scripture don't say blood the scripture say house it says 12 Tribes of is right so it's the house
(4:33) question is what makes you have that house what makes you have that house what makes you that blood curses prophecies and archaeology
(4:41) we we've been saying it for the longest and also the spirit that's in the scriptures well yeah I know but if it's
(4:47) biological how do you personally trace your root biologically did you not hear me did you
(4:54) not hear me I said I don't I don't understand though that's why I'm clarifying Andre you so
(5:00) you saying to me like did you not hear me doesn't say anything right that doesn't clarify anything let me ask one
(5:07) question time one mik at a time real quick ask one question I've been kind of quiet hold up let me say one thing uh
(5:14) what's your name what's your name Andrew Andrew let me ask you one question what what race of people went into slavery on
(5:21) ships throughout the history of mankind uh all Races of people name me the races
(5:26) that went to slavery through ships uh well so I would say if so race I think
(5:31) is a construction of the mind um I'm talking about fleshly race I'm talking
(5:37) about race yeah I understand I think I just want to clarify this so I make sure I'm answering your question correctly
(5:43) when you say race are you talking about black white are you talking okay got you
(5:49) yes if that's the case theistic of black white things like this then every single
(5:54) race on planet Earth has been trafficked in slavery in a big way every single one of by ships yes in
(6:02) ships name me the time that white people went into slavery by ships the barber States enslaved whites the Arabs
(6:09) enslaved Whit when when was this uh so the most recent occurrence of this
(6:14) happened in the time of Thomas Jefferson the hold up hold up let me reward this in Mass numbers what race of people went
(6:20) into slavery by ships into a land that is not their land I don't I don't understand the I'm
(6:27) sorry I actually don't understand the question what are you actually asking the key the key part of the key
(6:32) component is he's emphasizing there being a maritime nature to the slave
(6:37) trade not simply trafficking but literally trafficking across the world through vessels on o on water so yeah so
(6:45) I understand this so we had the transatlantic tra slave trade and then we had the Arabic slave trade the Arabic
(6:52) slave trade moved uh slaves towards the Arab Nations they killed all their slaves that's why there's not a lot of
(6:58) black Arabs and then you move the on the other side they moved them over to the Americas but this is the transit that's
(7:04) new that's new like this has been happening slavery has been happening for
(7:09) thousands of years via shipping actual ship which ones with the
(7:14) ships all Races no yeah so can you answer every sing Listen every single one going from the Greeks to yes all of
(7:22) them every every single the the Vikings used to use ships to go and get slaves
(7:27) from China I'm not kidding hold on hear me out Esau what I'm trying to say to you is this right here bro I
(7:34) mean Esau is that the SoCal the so-called black people are the only
(7:39) people that are documented of going through slavery stripped from everything from their names to the language to
(7:45) their Customs to their God where to to a day they identify by a cutor out the crayon box that's only happened to a
(7:52) certain people in history hold up let me I'm almost finished let me land my problem no problem goad that's a prophecy that's prophesized in the Bible
(7:58) to let you know who the Israelites are okay so I just want to let you know that what you're saying though is factually
(8:04) untrue so Rome for instance is a great example of uh a society which was
(8:09) literally constructed by slavery there's more slaves in Rome than there were Romans they did this to All Peoples they
(8:16) stripped them of their name they stripped them of their title they stripped them of their family they stripped them of the whole idea was you
(8:22) must become Roman now in some places later they let him have some customs things like this but this happened in
(8:28) the modern slave trade too so in the the Americas for instance some slave owners they let them have customs and things
(8:34) like this sometimes not it just depends where they were in history but no I'm I'm telling all Races had this happened
(8:41) to them all of them those people that went through their slavery in Rome are the people that we're saying that are
(8:46) Israelites and we are those people yeah but that was all people all people yeah
(8:51) listen I I mean I mean got y can handle do yeah but but this doesn't make any
(8:56) sense because all I mean all tribes that they Incorporated who they made a Slave cast they erased they erased them they
(9:04) made them become Roman all of them and this happened to all sorts of bar Barbarian tribes I mean this just this
(9:10) happened to everybody yeah Andrew Andrew so so just to be clear how we make a determination because of course this is
(9:17) a ethno we're talking about an ethn religious group um being the ancient Israelites and and we're talking about
(9:23) an ethn religious ideology right so there were various things various prophecies that were for for told that
(9:30) would occur in the latter days to the Israelites and their descendants so what we do what we're doing is we're taking a
(9:36) look at those prophecies and we're seeing if those prophecies have been fulfilled in various people groups throughout the planet Earth today and
(9:42) we've identified those with people who are black but you have to be very careful with that because you're not
(9:48) prophets yourself so so Jesus hang on hang on hang Prophet Prophet we are is
(9:54) PL Jesus Christ was the last the reason we don't have new prophets we have new
(10:00) prophets is so that you cannot reinterpret the scripture for your own making for you so you can't go in and be
(10:07) like well I'm Joseph Smith the head of the Mormon church and I'm a prophet and so I've just made this entirely new
(10:13) religion which he did by saying hey I'm a prophet no you you by the way cannot
(10:19) make prophetic interpretations absent being a prophet
(10:24) right like you can't you have to interpret them we are can I read a scripture can I read the scripture when
(10:30) you say that and that we're not prophets right this 1 Corinthians 12 and 28 and
(10:36) it says and God had set summon the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that
(10:43) Miracles then Gifts of healings helps governments diversities and tongues So
(10:48) when you say that there's no prop hang on wait a second give me the scripture real quick let's pull it up we'll go over together 1 Corinthians 12 and 28
(10:55) okay when you say yeah so when you say that there's not prophet after Christ um
(11:00) I would disagree because that's how you set up the body as a body f as a body of Christ would function you would have
(11:07) Prophets You would have Apostles you would have teachers you would have those with the gift of tongues if that were
(11:12) the case then you shouldn't have no pastors or so okay I just want to point out that you're you're so here's the
(11:18) thing then is Joseph Smith a false prophet yes how do you know because he's
(11:25) not an Israelite so only Israelites can be prophets correct for sure that's it
(11:32) that's it that's what the book says okay that's what the book say it has to if you're not an Israelite then you cannot
(11:37) be a prophet so can Israelites create new prophecy Israelites can yeah if God
(11:44) reveals it to them yes okay that's why I read that's why I read 1 Corinthians 12 and 28 after Christ death are you a
(11:51) prophet yes okay and so both of you are prophets for sure and so you can for can
(11:57) you foresee future events yeah sometimes okay a prophet isn't a
(12:02) prophet is also a teacher Prophet is everything a prophet ain't just telling prophecy proph prophesy they teach they
(12:09) you verify the tenacity of a prophet through prophecy that's how you verify the tenacity so the way that I would
(12:16) verify a prophet you verify it also by them breaking down what's already written
(12:21) also but that would be that would be post Haw so that wouldn't verify you as a prophet because you're hang on cuz
(12:28) you're interpret things which have already happened and then trying to contextualize them in a way that and
(12:34) anybody can do this anybody can do this so the thing is is that to verify that you are a prophet can you give me a
(12:42) prophecy which you have foretold that has come true that we can verify So when you say that we're not we
(12:49) can't prophesy something that's already written that's incorrect Romans 15 and4 says what was whatsoever was written a
(12:55) four time was written for our learning that through patience and comfor for the Des scriptures we might have hope so as
(13:01) Guerilla was breaking down interpretation I don't know why you're in if you want the respect to speak you
(13:07) got to give it when gorilla when Guerilla was breaking down how we came over here in in the transatlantic slave
(13:14) trade that did not happen yet even though it's written in Deuteronomy the 28th chapter so in Deuteronomy the 28th
(13:21) chapter as that is being broken down nobody can explain how black Hispanics suffered through the transatlantic slave
(13:28) trade until God woke up prophets to break it down to the people and that's
(13:33) what you see today where they can go and read those prophecies break those prophecies down and then reveal not only
(13:39) the Prophecies of old but what we're supposed to do today okay but you have a problem here which is that you're
(13:44) conflating interpretation with prophecy so you can look at a prophecy which an actual Prophet put down let's say and
(13:51) you can interpret it that doesn't mean your interpretation is correct how we would know that your interpretation is
(13:58) prop phcy would be correct if you're if you're an actual prophet and making that claim would be how to test the tenacity
(14:06) of your foretelling and prophecy so demonstrate for us any prophecy which
(14:12) you have foretold which we can verify can you do that or
(14:17) not one Gilla if I just give one and I give it right to I'm G give right to you
(14:22) and Matthew's the 12th chap chapter Christ said this perverse generation
(14:28) seeketh for a sign that's what he said and that's what you are like when you ask that but he said there shall be no
(14:35) sign you know what the sign was when Christ taught Christ taught repentance
(14:41) that was his prophecy Christ said repent repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and if Christ is our King we do it
(14:48) the same way and and if you want you've been asking for scriptures the whole time so that's Matthews 12 and but his
(14:54) question isn't on that his question is too going to read real quick real quick though cuz I've
(15:01) been sitting and letting y rock is to verify if you're a prophet like show
(15:06) proof I'm reading what listen they said the same I'm read Matthews 12 and 38
(15:11) this is what they said to Christ the same question he's asked can I read it but there's a problem certain it's not a
(15:17) problem showing I'm showing a direct parallel of how they acted towards
(15:22) Christ is the same way you're acting now this is Matthews 12 and 38 and then I'll give it to guilla it says then certain
(15:29) of the scribes and the Pharisees answered saying Master would we see a
(15:34) sign from thee which is what you're asking and this was Christ's answer he says but he answered and said unto them
(15:41) an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no
(15:47) sign be given to it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas so there there was a sign
(15:52) given and this was the sign for as Jonas with three days and three nights in the Well's belly so shall the son of man be
(15:59) three days and three nights in the heart of the earth what did Jonah do when he came out that uh whale he taught the
(16:04) people repentance that's what he taught them so that's the sign yeah but this
(16:10) this so the problem that you have here is that if I post Hawk go back and give
(16:16) a completely different interpretation of this than you do and make the claim that
(16:22) I can do so because I'm a prophet right uh then how would we verify which thing
(16:29) is true we could verify that by somebody who makes the claim of a being a prophet
(16:36) of fulfilling or giving prophecy which has been fulfilled that's how it was
(16:41) always verified biblically prophets would go in and interpret dreams those dreams would then become reality there's
(16:47) all sorts of instances of this I want to see some actual verification when you make the claim
(16:53) that you're a prophet that's not post Haw charlatans use post Haw numerologists use post haw all of these
(16:59) people use post Haw after the event is done then they retroactively predict the event that's been done and it's like
(17:06) that's not prophecy that's some madeup gobble goop so do you can you verify
(17:12) that you're a prophet through prophecy you've given that has become fulfilled or will become fulfilled or can't you uh
(17:20) Andrew I I I could there's dozens of people who can verify all those things about me no but he's speaking
(17:26) specifically about YouTu can YouTu verify I said about me that I've done all of
(17:31) those things that he said I I have scores of people that can do that but here's my thing right my thing is this
(17:38) where is the biblical precedence for the criteria you're trying to hold us to right now because I haven't seen that book exp so first of all there's God has
(17:46) ontology there's ont the being of God so the logos or logic is part of the being
(17:54) of God okay otherwise otherwise you would enter into all sorts of contradictions like can God where's the
(17:59) Bible verse God I'll show you I'm going to bro I'm going to demonstrate something for you
(18:06) so that you understand if I say to you can God make another God more powerful
(18:11) than him can God make a a rock that's too heavy for God to lift right you yeah
(18:16) exactly you would say no right you'd say no because I'm saying you're not answering the question hang to answer answer it in
(18:26) scale he's not answering I'm gonna answer it in scale let him land his plane so anyway uh in order to do this
(18:33) in order for you to uh contend with those logical questions you're going to have to defer to the nature of God
(18:40) himself and part of that nature is logic it's a metaphysical rule rules for the universe which exists that cannot be
(18:47) accounted for other than through God that's it now and okay well I'll tell you what refute the laws of logic
(18:53) without using them then go ahead if I could real fast post Haw is a
(18:59) rationalization is a type of faulty thinking that occurs when someone assumes that one event caused another
(19:05) simply because one event happen after the other so when you say that that's post Haw ad I meant ad hoc sorry I'll
(19:13) look that up too but I just want to I think I think I just you can take it right there I just wanted to pull that
(19:19) definition because pull hang on pull up ad hoc I'll pull it up in a second but I
(19:25) also want to add is Gorilla asked him to show the criteria in the Bible and he
(19:30) went to logic not to the criteria Pro because what I'm telling you is that everything which is biblical
(19:37) also has to conform with logic otherwise it's incoherent well well Andrew like
(19:43) the one of the first things you said was there's no Prophet after Jesus and the first thing that cazar did was show you
(19:50) prophets under Paul decades after the crucifixion death burial and resurrection of Jesus so you your your
(19:55) your initial Point has already been debunked but please show me the verse for your criteria okay first I'm what
(20:01) I'm tell ad if you I have the defition now give it the definition of ad hoc thank you so ad hoc is a rationalization
(20:08) excuse me ad hoc rationalization is a logical fallacy that involves making up
(20:13) an explanation to defend a belief or claim without evidence so that also
(20:19) doesn't fit so after after so after the event is done you're rationalizing the event but it says to make up the
(20:26) explanation to me making up an explanation to defend a belief or claim
(20:32) without evidence so you can't say that because when gorilla brought up Deuteronomy 28 and 68 in the
(20:38) transatlantic slave trade as well as the other brother that's an event that H me that was prophesied to happen no
(20:45) rationalization it's not rationalization it's a rationalization because that doesn't those two events it doesn't mean
(20:51) that those two I don't understand why I gotta let you talk but you can't let me talk so when you say when you say Ad HW when
(20:58) you say ad hoc right you are taking and rationalizing an event and then you're saying this event is related to this one
(21:04) I'm making rationalization for it after the fact that's my rationalization what I'm saying to you is this well hang on
(21:11) what I'm saying to you is this even if I granted it to you and just said you know what I use the language incorrectly in
(21:17) both terms what I'm saying is that after you you the event happens you're rationalizing the event and trying to
(21:23) tie scripture in your interpretation back to it you can't verify things that way because it it wouldn't show that you
(21:30) were an actual Prophet now the gentleman who's under me said he can do this he
(21:36) has done this he will continue to do this where's the proof but I agree with
(21:41) him but I want to tell you an example in Matthew's the first chapter when Christ was born you know what they said the
(21:48) they referenced Isaiah 7:14 and said Christ is born from a virgin I'm paraphrasing the scripture so the same
(21:55) way a prophecy was written about Christ that is fulfilled later that the prophet
(22:01) Matthew or the Apostle Matthew deciphered and broke down is the same way Deuteronomy 28 and 68 was written
(22:08) that prophets came later and broke down so when you say that it's an ad hoc you would have to say that Christ also was a
(22:16) ad hoc that's what you would have to say no no you wouldn't that would also be another rationalization so here let's
(22:22) let's break this down first and foremost you're evading all answers to this and you've been evading it the entire time
(22:28) so I'm just G to ask again I'll keep on asking
(22:35) you until until you okay great great okay I haven't answered your question
(22:41) but anyway one more time I'm going to ask you sir if you are a prophet and you
(22:47) have indeed cast prophecy and they have been fulfilled as you have claimed can you show us or demonstrate any shred of
(22:55) proof for this the moment you answer my question that's when I'll demonstrate my proof he actually time out Andrew real
(23:02) quick he asked first and you and you Tred to e you try to avoid the entire
(23:08) question we need some proof this is crazy both of y'all saying that y prophets no we we need some proof no
(23:15) coie here's the problem he made a declaration of a prophetic standard and what it was I'm asking him to validate
(23:23) his standardization that would make me think dignify it with an answer I reject what he's alleging is a prophetic
(23:29) standard I don't think there's biblical precedence for his prophetic standard so I'm asking him to now demonstrate where
(23:36) it says in order for you to interpret propy hold on hold on in order for you to interpret prophecy you must have to
(23:43) demonstrate that you have prophesied okay Andrew real quick I'll just grant it I'll just grant it let's assume for a
(23:50) moment that I'm completely incorrect just for the sake of argument I don't even I have no idea like what what what
(23:56) am I even talking about you claimed sir that you have done all of these things
(24:02) so even if I'm wrong and I'll just grant that I am for the sake of argument can you now demonstrate that you have done
(24:08) any of those things please how would you like me to demonstrate it by showing us evidence
(24:15) and proofs okay so how can I show you an Evidence of proof or proof uh that you
(24:20) have uh cast prophecy written it down it's come true yeah how would I show you the evidence of that show us the
(24:26) writings of it and the dates of it and then say this is what happened things like this the same way we verify the
(24:33) same way verify if I go so if I go okay I wrote that there would be this
(24:38) happened and I just showed you right here and then I said this was written on the date of January 3rd and then it
(24:45) happened January 4th that that's that's what I would need to do right now that would at least be some evidence that that that would that would be adequate
(24:52) that would at least be some evidence yeah there are human beings in the chat that could attest to my prophecies right
(24:59) I don't I don't need I don't need to just take a piece of paper that that I could have wrote at any time and try to
(25:06) postulated as occurring none of that is about the gorilla I think you're mistaking Prophecy with intuition like
(25:13) all human beings have intu I'm not I'm not mistaking anything what I'm what I'm doing is I'm you're really saying that
(25:20) you're a prophet I try I try to actually get give you a bone here I'm try to give you a bone so you gorilla real quick
(25:27) gorilla I've been chilling I haven't been speaking relax I'm going have to mute you bro I was I wasn't speaking at
(25:32) all I've been letting all of y'all speak so I tried to give you a bone hair are you not mistaking prophecy for intuition
(25:40) because everyone has intuition you can be intuitive okay that's cool if you're not saying that you're intuitive and
(25:46) you're actually saying that you are a Prophet this is crazy we would need some proof okay listen but here's the problem
(25:54) he he brought having to be a prophet into to being able to interpret the
(26:00) Bible right that's the difference here whether I'm a prophet or not is not the
(26:05) conversation he's trying to now deviate the conversation into that he keeps talking about that is the conversation
(26:13) that is the conversation brother because you said that only the Hebrew Israelites can be prophets this all stream from
(26:19) your argument what it's real cute what you guys are doing right now so so let let
(26:26) me explain what's happening what hold on Andrew I'm talking I'm talking Andrew
(26:31) right we we have somebody who's trying who's trying to be who's trying to postulate logic that's that's allegedly
(26:39) the place he's coming from that's what I've been doing the entire time I'm Co coie I'm not talking about you it's not
(26:45) what you're not who I'm talking about I'm talking about Andrew who who who is allegedly coming from a place of logic
(26:50) who the first thing he said was there's no Prophet after Christ that was immediately and instantly debunked by
(26:56) Captain zarak he hasn't had had to own up to that right then then he made he totally created a prophetic standard
(27:04) tried to enforce it on people when he was questioned he could do nothing but conceive but alleges that he's coming
(27:10) from a place of logic since we've been on the camera he's chain smoked when lung cancer is the leading cancer and
(27:16) killer of white Americans period right from smoking so he him being wrong him
(27:24) making things up and him being illogical
(27:31) disted Gill gorilla chill out chill out real quick getting distracted no no we're not getting distracted me tell let
(27:37) me tell you you fallacy why did he ask if somebody was a prophet Tell Me Tell You Why why
(27:45) I'll tell you why you know why it's because the conversation that y'all can't answer the question remember you
(27:50) said that God is a racist you said that there's a hierarchy in heaven and only the Hebrew Israelites is going to be at
(27:56) the top of the hierarchy it's only based off of their ethnicity then Andrew Wilson asked you a question he said well
(28:02) how how does how do you verify this is it through um biology or is it through
(28:08) like how do you find this out you guys couldn't give an answer you said through prophecy he asked you who's a prophet
(28:13) I've been listening clearly here he says who's a prophet if we gave an answer how you say that you're a prophet and
(28:20) then he's trying to ask you to verify stop gorilla stop you wanted me to explain he's asking to verif Li
(28:28) everybody you just lied you just told me that we couldn't give an answer and then told us what our
(28:35) answer was that's a lie how can we not give an answer but we gave the answer stop it you're misinterpreting what I'm
(28:41) saying I'm not misinterpreting nothing you just say we didn't listen real quick bro real quick
(28:49) and Andrew I'll let you L your PL that's because you're lying no one's lying no one's lying man you're a Propet is what
(28:55) the LIE is Sir believe said we did something that's a lie stop it stop it
(29:01) gorilla stop it you believe in AET you should have known that and predicted it
(29:06) beforehand and written it down and then he could demonstrate the proof of it true
(29:12) we hold because hold on yes because prophets are Clairvoyant no there's not
(29:17) a prophet is not a psychic being able to foresee an event from occurring does not give you the ability to see everything
(29:24) before it happens [ __ ] be for real how do you know how do you know because I cuz I know I know
(29:30) enough know not to change smoke Andrew you're
(29:35) so mad y you don't know enough not to eat a bunch of [ __ ] cheeseburgers so I don't know what the [ __ ] you're talking about bro I can't wait till you
(29:42) get canc man I N he not getting canceled man no I
(29:48) said cancer not canceled I don't want him canceled oh you said a man why would you wish that on someone that's crazy
(29:53) man why would you why would you actually wish cancer on someone not cancel
(29:59) actually if we're speaking about morality here this is the thing bro gorill stop I anything on anybody time
(30:07) out stop didn't say I hope you get cancer did I time out stop gorilla stop did I say I hope got cancer stop gorilla
(30:14) did I say that when when you when you all of these Hebrew Israelites there you
(30:19) are lying your voice is as loud as your cholesterol Cal down calm down bro bro listen I just muted you real quick I'm
(30:25) going to unmute you but listen man this entire debate was all structured around
(30:30) morality right you guys all admitted that racism is immoral but then you also
(30:36) say that God is a racist God so you're what well you wasn't here yet uh first cap but I'm speaking about um uh gorilla
(30:44) and then 6'5 the other Hebrew Israelite was up here first you're saying that that's a lie we can just rewind the tape
(30:50) back we have the proof you said that you believe in a racist God and but you also say that racism is immoral so that means
(30:58) that God is immoral this entire conversation is about meta ethics morality but guess what your meta ethics
(31:04) is incompatible with your informative ethics so this hierarchy that you supposedly that there is in heaven that
(31:11) only Hebrew Israelites is going to be on top is only based by race this would deem that God is racist and guess what
(31:17) you've all said that well only Hebrew Israelites can be prophets Andrew Wilson is asking a specific question to verify
(31:24) how you are a prophet you haven't given us any answers you're reading some scriptures you're going off point we
(31:30) need proof okay so I just want to give a brief recap because what you're saying
(31:35) is you just lied on I never said racism was immoral I never said that that's a lie again thank
(31:42) you right and I don't know I don't know if listening okay I don't know I don't know if you wasn't listening to the
(31:48) answer but when he first so you gave a good recap I'm going to get the correct recap so when he came on here saying to
(31:54) prove that we're prophets the first thing I did was read Christ's answer
(32:00) when he was asked to prove and he immediately said a perverse and adulterous generation seek it for a sign
(32:08) which is what he's looking for so if Christ is our King and who we look after just like he didn't feel the need to
(32:15) prove himself to those people except to Resurrection except to Resurrection anybody when they spoke I didn't
(32:21) interrupt anybody when they SP show no proof except the whole Resurrection I didn't interrupt anybody when they spoke
(32:28) oh man when they asked him to prove himself the same way he's asking to prove himself he called them a perverse
(32:35) and adulterous generation that seeketh for a sign I didn't call him that I just
(32:41) said the same way my king Christ didn't feel the need to prove himself to them I
(32:46) don't have to prove myself but by teaching and then I read the verse I said Christ said he was proven by
(32:52) teaching them repentance So when you say that we didn't answer the question we absolutely answered the question then
(32:59) gorilla asked him to prove the criteria that he has the right to ask us that
(33:05) question he yielded and said I don't know where that's at in the Bible now once he says I don't know where that's
(33:11) at in the Bible we don't have that's lie never happen he just said what if I say
(33:16) it's not in the Bible what not say I was granting granting it for the shake of
(33:22) argument show where the logic goes wait wa wait cause I didn't interrupt nobody when they spoke but if you want to use
(33:28) the word granting instead of yielding he still did not show the biblical for we
(33:35) talk about the Bible so whatever we talk about has to come from the Bible so if it's somewhere in the Bible where
(33:40) someone can ask a prove your Prophet then he would have a legit question but if I read in the Bible when Christ was
(33:47) asked to prove he was a prophet and he answered him by calling him perverse and adulterers you can't tell me that I have
(33:54) to prove to him so now okay so I'll give you the proofs I just want to finish
(34:01) okay and then you all right cool and then he said then he brought up the term
(34:06) ad hoc where he brought up the wrong word but I read both definitions for him and he said we can't take a verse from
(34:13) the past and use it as a prophecy for the future that's what he said and then
(34:19) I used Isaiah 7:14 Isaiah 7:14 said behold a virgin
(34:24) shall conceive and when Christ was born they used the verse from the past to
(34:30) reveal it as a prophecy of the future and then I highlighted how gorilla Hebrew used Deuteronomy
(34:37) 2868 a verse from the past as a prophecy of the future unless you going to tell
(34:43) me the prophets that use Deuteronomy 2868 as a fulfill point then we've
(34:50) actually answered your question because that's been the answer so you can't say
(34:55) that we didn't you can disagree with the answer but you can't say that we didn't answer the question yeah I can say he
(35:02) didn't answer to the question that was asked he answer to the question that was not asked so the thing is is we're talking about verification we're talking
(35:10) about Jesus Christ verifying that he was a prophet he conducted Miracles he made
(35:16) the prediction of the Resurrection he literally demonstrated these Miracles and the resurrection to say that Jesus
(35:22) Christ gave no proofs of his divinity or prophecy is insane he gave proof hang on
(35:28) hang on my turn my turn bro my turn let let him land his plan man okay Co I I love how can't say anything got just
(35:35) buer the whole world is seeing it yeah good I'm glad the whole world is seeing it listen bro it's I literally had like
(35:41) four Hebrew Israelites get against me Andrew Wilson is on my side I'm giving him a chance to speak that's all I'm
(35:46) doing I'm just saying I'm just saying to you there's proof after proof after proof verification after verification provided by Christ himself that he was a
(35:53) prophet in his own works over and over and over including the resurrection itself that shows and demonstrates that
(36:00) his prophetic ability I don't even know how you can deny that it's absurd you point to a passage that you're
(36:05) misinterpreting the context of that's one and then two when we dive into this
(36:11) remember this gentleman below me said that he himself has done all of these
(36:18) things he has done all of them but the only proof that he can give to us is well some of my friends can verify and
(36:24) vouch for it no one's going to accept that as proof that's ridicul I hang on hang on my let me finish I'm
(36:30) almost done okay so again all I'm asking for is some verification of the proofs
(36:36) you say I don't have to prove it to you because I can point to scripture right but think about this how how silly this
(36:43) actually is because think about how many people if this was a true claim and he went ahead and provided the proofs for
(36:49) this claim how many people would instantly go over to your side right this second there's no logical reason
(36:56) whatsoever you wouldn't just go and provide proof for the claim that you're prophets okay so so like C Zar proved
(37:03) right nobody said that Christ did not verify that he was a prophet what Tarak proved by verse is in practice when
(37:10) Christ was challenged on his prophetic Authority he did not provide the proof he did not dignify that challenge with a
(37:17) proof so what he's demonstrating is we're doing the same thing following after have to because one he was Christ
(37:24) and two the other reason that he didn't need to is because he already was he was already doing it the voraciousness of
(37:30) the proof hang on was already demonstrated show me hold on again again
(37:37) real quick you popping up having zero familiarity with us whatsoever coming and trying to challenge us does not take
(37:44) away from the fact that we've already proven ourselves and our works for well over a but we don't but that's the point that
(37:51) he showed we don't have to prove it to you just because you show up in our first conv why should anybody believe
(37:57) trying to challenge us we don't have to prove and why should anybody believe you
(38:02) you don't have to believe they're not going to logical reason hold on hold on
(38:08) just the same way you didn't have to believe Jesus it's your choice you don't have to believe anybody can you can you
(38:14) here what's the logical want you to believe me to out a timeas one M out of
(38:20) time I understand logically Just give me a reason why you won't show proofs a logical reason if I could I'll give you a logical reason you said
(38:28) you mis L I'm glad gorilla pointed out I never said Christ didn't show no Miracles I said when he was asked to
(38:35) prove himself he denied it and then you try to make a a statement that everybody
(38:40) knew Jesus did everybody didn't because if they did they wouldn't have asked him to prove it the fact that they asked him
(38:46) to prove it lets you know that everybody didn't want to believe in him either they like show us this show us that the
(38:52) same way you are so like when it comes to that when you read Daniels 12 um and
(38:58) nine for example it says and he said go thy Way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end
(39:05) the only way that that seal gets opened up is first when Christ resurrected and then when he revealed it to His prophets
(39:11) to wake up the children of Israel which is going to happen at the latter end which is what you see now but we don't
(39:17) have to prove it to you that's why when I don't understand why people like I
(39:23) said even if you don't accept the answer I gave you book chapter verse as to why
(39:28) I don't have to answer you you have not provided a book chapter verse that you
(39:34) can ask that question do you understand that anybody do that can you Prov before
(39:40) I mute up I'm gon mute up now but can you provide the book chapter verse of you of the question that you're asking
(39:47) yes Deuteronomy 1820 through 22 but the prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded or a
(39:53) prophet who speaks in the name of other gods is to be put to death you may say to yourself how can we know when a message has not been spoken by the Lord
(40:00) if what prophet proclaims in the name of the Lord does not take place or come true that is a message the Lord has not
(40:06) spoken the prophet has spoken presumptuously do not be alarmed so sir
(40:13) can you give me the proof please no problem and we answer that when gorilla
(40:19) Hebrew gave you Deuteronomy 28 and 68 no he's asking for proof
(40:27) think that's what you're doing I don't think you're understanding what he's saying hey when Christ was born I'm ask
(40:33) this simple question because I don't know if this is remedial if y'all not listening or what when Christ was born
(40:40) did they quote a scripture that happened before Christ was born and then apply it
(40:45) to Christ yes or no yes so if we take that same pattern as
(40:52) the prophets of God to see this prophecy of Deuteronomy 28 and6
(40:57) and then apply it to us today aren't we doing the same thing yes or no yeah so
(41:03) those what you're talking about it's logically question makes no
(41:09) sense a prophet who presumes to speak in my name okay here's what your guidelines are how can we know when the message has
(41:17) not been spoken by the Lord right if what a prophet proclaims in the name of the Lord does not take place or come
(41:23) true that is a message the Lord has not spoken through him so this gentleman
(41:28) claimed and this was my claim that you need to verify yourself this way cuz the Bible says that claimed that you're that
(41:34) you sir could do this so I'm asking you since you say you do it in the name hey stop bro since you say you do it in the
(41:41) name of the Lord to go ahead and give me the proof of verification please so so
(41:47) so nice try Andrew that verse does not demonstrate the criteria that you laid out that verse did not say in order to
(41:54) have the capability to to interpret scripture you would have to first be a prophet and
(41:59) your prophecies would have to be demonstratable by X Y and Z hold on hold on Andrew I'm me sentence thank
(42:08) you I mean Co you ain't you ain't gonna get you're not gonna police I'm letting
(42:13) you land your plane go ahead yall both asking it out land your plan I would just love you to have the same Vigor you
(42:19) have when we're talking when he's talking when y do I like but go ahead playing
(42:28) today do ad exactly so so so anyway that verse is how do we know if somebody gave
(42:34) a false prophecy if they said something was going to happen and it didn't happen
(42:40) so what you would then have to ask us predicated on that verse is what event have we predicted that never happened we
(42:47) never said we did that so again that doesn't I'm not done talking Andrew yeah okay go ahead so again that didn't
(42:55) demonstrate your criteria whatsoever and you never asked us at any point what is
(43:00) an event that we predicted that never occurred because that would be in accordance with that verse so here's
(43:06) what actually happened in reality and and you guys can all both of you should rewind the tape to watch this I gave you
(43:12) specific criteria about how to test a prophet because I knew it all right so I told you here's the criteria to test a
(43:17) prophet any of the prophecies as you claim you are prophets to test you we need to test a thing which you have
(43:24) predicted and then see if it has come true that's the test right we know this biblically so stop stop bro and then
(43:31) what here's what you did read it okay I'll I'll read it again can I read it how can we know when a message has not
(43:37) been spoken by the Lord has not let him read it go ahead if what a prophet
(43:43) proclaims yo just let him land his plane let him read it he asked them to read it let him read it if what a prophet
(43:48) proclaims the name of the Lord does not take place or come true that is a message the Lord has not spoken great
(43:53) now we know how to test so if you say you're a prophet now if he stop bro stop I why won't you even let me won't even
(44:00) let me finish my sentence so anyway let land the
(44:07) inter gentleman said you next bro you next trust me specifically was that I have made such predictions I have done
(44:15) all of that I have predicted the future I have people who can vouch for me I have predicted the future therefore he
(44:22) is beholden to the criteria the testing criteria in Deuteronomy that I can test
(44:27) the veracity of him being a prophet he so far has provided no such proof sir because he's not one now can I just read
(44:35) the verse because that's not how the verse goes if we going to read verses let's have enough biblical Integrity to
(44:42) read the verse because it doesn't say what he said Deuteronomy 18 20-22 says
(44:48) this but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which I have
(44:54) not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even
(45:00) that Prophet shall die that's what verse 20 says and if thou say in thine heart
(45:05) how shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken when a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord if the
(45:12) thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the Lord have not spoken but the prophet have spoken it
(45:20) presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid of him so when gorilla said Propet a liar what when gorilla said you would
(45:27) have to show him what he said that didn't come to pass to call him a false prophet he was correct because the
(45:34) criteria of a false prophet is if we were saying to go after other gods we do
(45:40) not if we were saying not to do anything after what God said we are not so you
(45:46) the qu the scripture that you brought us to you would have to show us what we said contrary to what God Said totally
(45:53) fair it's so I will he said he made the claim made multiple claims that he has
(45:59) been able to foretell the future he said I've done that I've done have people who can vouch that I have done that
(46:06) presumably in the name of the Lord I don't know how you would prophesy these things going forward absent that unless it's a demon so if this is the case I'm
(46:13) just asking based on the criteria I know to test this prophet and I'm testing him
(46:19) so please for the 300 time can you provide the proof sir that you're a prophet we we we've redundantly address
(46:27) that and we again you have not demonstrated say no just say no you you've you've no here here's here's the
(46:34) difference right I between you and I right I don't I don't have to subjugate myself answer any question do anything
(46:41) the way that you want me to why debate you said what then why debate but here's
(46:46) the problem you still have not demonstrated your criteria so again you read a verse that did not demonstrate
(46:53) what you said and again no no no again so so like for example he literally read the ver verse homie the verse so coie
(47:02) that verse says that verse says in order to be able to interpret scripture you would first have to prove that you're a
(47:09) prophet based off of X Y and Z that's what it says no no sir that's what he
(47:15) said and that's what our has been the whole time no no it's not what I said specifically is that this is the fourth
(47:20) time You' lied in like 20 years that's czy goad Andrew that if you're a prophet
(47:25) I'm gonna test it that you are making predictions and claims in the name of the Lord which you're claiming that you are and that you have people who can
(47:31) vouch for the veracity of this great I'm here to test that as hang on as the
(47:36) Bible says I'm supposed to and that's exactly what I'm doing if you cannot provide proof just say I can't Andrew
(47:44) are you did Jesus refuse did Jesus refuse to provide Jes you're not Jesus
(47:50) hold but it doesn't I I'm a follower of Jesus so as a follower I'm supposed to mimic what he's doing no but you claim
(47:56) you're a prophet and I'm supposed to test you no okay so so so we've already proven that somebody attempted to test
(48:02) Jesus on the spot whether or not he was a prophet and but but not I'm mids sentence coie are you gonna get him on a
(48:09) leash you interrupted me first you g get leash did interrupt him first bro back and forth go back what did you and what
(48:16) did you do every time we interrupt him tell us to shut up and let us land our plan one time you you haven't done it to
(48:23) him one time so what you're actually demonstrating is the
(48:31) I get this go ahead land your plane yeah I just want to go back to the very first thing that Andrew said Andrew said
(48:37) nobody has a problem with black people segregating themselves that's the very first thing he says and I wanted to say
(48:43) yes nobody but black people have a problem with black people segregating themselves because black people have
(48:48) internalized white supremacy that's why everybody has watched coie go and have a cape on and protect Andrew at all cost
(48:55) from everybody else panel everybody's watch that let let let me say this real
(49:00) quick okay so this is this is what's going on here trying to uh to assist other people I don't know that means
(49:07) it's because of internalized white supremacy I know right so look let's just make this make let's just make all
(49:14) of this make sense for the chat and everyone's watching on Andrew stream as well too so maybe I did get one thing
(49:20) wrong because the other gentleman was in and I got it mixed up so what you said is that God has racist ideology that's
(49:28) what you said right gorilla ideals yes okay and I demonstrated them with the Bible no no you didn't so real quick the
(49:37) other guy no no no how did I not how did I not demonstrate that let me let me my
(49:42) you're ly you interrupting him in the middle of you why you so
(49:49) much you explain why you lie so much I showed a Bible verse where God says you can charge interest to other people
(49:58) I'm have to mute you again cuz both y' about to get this smoke to get this smoke so you mute it
(50:03) real quick just let me land my plane no one's running don't go anywhere gorilla cuz I don't want you to I want you to hear this and I want the chat to hear
(50:10) this too so it was like four veres 1 me and four Hebrew Israelites all of these
(50:17) guys believe pretty much the same thing that either God is a racist or God has racist ideology their belief that In
(50:25) Heaven There Will Be a hierarchy and only the Hebrew Israelites will be at the top top of this hierarchy and the
(50:31) Hebrew Israelites uh the Hebrew Israelites is only based off of race and ethnicity so it's not based off of being
(50:39) virtuous being moral morally good not based off of anything else but it's only based off of race and ethnicity this is
(50:46) the definition of racism so we got a black man down below our people I'm
(50:51) black our people suffered 400 years of slavery of people that adopted the same
(50:57) ideology so you mean to tell me that the ideology that you're spewing is the same
(51:03) thing that the white colonizers disputing you're actually the racist you're actually a racist you're actually
(51:09) a white man dressed in a cape that's what you are you are the colonizers you are trying to colonize people with this
(51:16) racist ideology this is why you're not getting that far because it's racist bro it is racist Jesus came back and said
(51:23) hey guess what if you repent in the name of Jesus you you get what I'm saying you can make
(51:28) it to Heaven there's so many different claims in the Bible where all people can be accepted in into heaven and it's not
(51:34) this hierarchy based off of racism so does this the man that enslaved us does they have the same
(51:41) right to get to that heaven as slave what I'm saying is you are making it
(51:46) justifiable meaning that guess what listen bro ask yes or no I didn't ask
(51:52) about my ideology stop it bro stop it bro question this is what I'm saying
(51:58) with your ideology it is just it makes it justifiable for the 400 years of
(52:03) slavery that all of the Europeans put the black people in that's what it means
(52:09) because you believe that God is a racist or has racist ideologies so therefore
(52:14) guess what the colonizers that colonize all the black people and bring them over to America they can just they can have a
(52:20) justifiable like well in the Bible I I'm a Hebrew Israelite so I have superiority I have a hierarchy over everyone else so
(52:27) it's justifiable for me to enslave y'all [ __ ] this is your ideology basically I refute it you can't
(52:35) refute it both of y'all been sitting here and it's been four of you you can't refute your racist ideology it leads
(52:41) people astray now you're both unmuted debunk me if I'm wrong yeah you are ignorantly
(52:48) wrong okay I asked you if the slave master and a slave have the same right
(52:54) to Heaven yes or no and you would answer question bro you're not muted hello okay so hold on hold on hold up let me answer
(53:00) his question real quick go ahead I have let me unmute you real quick let me
(53:07) mute you quick go ahead and St no answer your question I'm going I'm going to
(53:12) gorilla okay cool he can go go ahead gorilla go ahead so so let's let's just read the book of Revelation 2 and 26 and
(53:19) he that overcometh and keepeth my Works unto the end to him will I give power
(53:25) over the Nations that word for nations in the Greek is ethnos and that word ethnos is the eological origin of the
(53:33) word ethnicity I would give power over the ethnicities and he shall rule them with a rod of iron hierarchy as the
(53:40) vessels of a sh a Potter shall they be broken into Shivers even as I received
(53:46) of my father so right there there is discrimination and ethnic hierarchy coming out of the mouth of Jesus as he's
(53:53) talking about his future Kingdom we never said we weren't racist so that God didn't have racist ideologies we said
(53:58) we're not it's not the same as what happened to us nice attempt nice attempt
(54:04) at appeal to emotions wrong no one's appealing to no emotion Romans
(54:09) 229 but Romans 2:29 but a Jew is one inwardly and circumcision is a matter of
(54:17) the Heart by the spirit not by the letter his praise is is not from man but
(54:23) from God bro we can go verse for verse all day end
(54:29) day listen at the end of the day when we have a logical discussion when we have a
(54:34) log logical discussion your ideology would appeal to the same racist
(54:40) colonizers that enslave black people no it would not no it would not and the reason why I would not how you I'm I'm
(54:46) about to prove it wrong because when when I came on here and even as I came in and I heard Guerilla Hebrew speak
(54:53) when we talk about racism we clearly said we not talking about harming nobody
(54:58) you cannot compare us to the colonizer unless you going to show us out here putting white people or other
(55:04) non-israelites in Chains beating their back and forcing them into op that's not what I said you said we're just like
(55:12) ideology I didn't say what you are just like your ideology their ideology
(55:18) straight from the Roman Catholic Church said you can enslave the Any Nation
(55:25) that's not not following your belief that's their ideology and so they went
(55:31) out about enslaving everybody that was not a Roman Catholic and forc them to be
(55:36) Catholic So when you say our ideology is the same it is not because we don't promote violence against anybody we
(55:43) don't promote enslaving against anybody whatever we teach is out the Bible and what you did question no one answer no
(55:52) one ran from gorilla let me ask you a question real quick I get what you're saying's just ask a question to test if
(55:57) this even is going to make sense because I believe you're about to contradict yourself so here's a question you're a
(56:03) Hebrew Israelite say if someone wants to be a Hebrew Israelite as well what do
(56:09) they have to how can they verify if they're part of the chosen people as well and how can you verify that too
(56:17) good question so I don't have a problem answering the question I just want to finish my statement when gorilla just
(56:22) read Revelations 229 which is a future prophecy about those that endure with
(56:29) Christ that they would be able to rule over the nations with a rod of iron you chose not to answer it so if you're
(56:36) gonna say youge he just read are you listening listening is an art and when he he ask
(56:43) me a question he did you didn't even respond to it what you stat it was
(56:49) question what you did what you did was run to Romans the second chapter talk about you're not a Jew inwardly you're
(56:56) Jew outwardly that was your response to a question I didn't say you're I didn't say you're a Jew outwardly I said that
(57:01) in in Romans chapter 229 says that you're a Jew inwardly so do you think that God resp bro this the entire
(57:09) ideology doesn't make doesn't make any
(57:14) sense listen bro listen real quick listen real quick to me man listen to me real quick like let's just think here
(57:20) now everyone can see let's just think about it logically what you're speak what you're saying is that
(57:26) I'm going to make a clip out of it too bro what you're saying is this God
(57:33) discriminates outwardly not inwardly that's what your ideology is
(57:40) promoting you should be uh looking at this brother over that's below here to you to your right and have him verify
(57:47) his DNA cuz this brother don't look like he Hebrew Israelite of one of your people that's all I'm saying if it's ran
(57:53) through some bloodline so now you talk about colorism that's what you are speaking about that's what you guys are
(57:59) speaking about no we're not that's what you are speaking about we not an Israelite hold on wait wait wait hold on
(58:06) wait what' you say Andrew well that's to Andrew but I thought I was original question was how you refer to biology in
(58:12) this the origal biology is not skin
(58:17) tone well yes it is I mean I'll give example I'll give you an
(58:25) example brought up biology we said it's by the house or the seed of your father
(58:31) you are what your father is it's the 12 tribes of Israel I said that you're you're the SE so whatever your father is
(58:38) that's your ethnicity so if your father is not an Israelite you're not an Israelite it doesn't say your house back
(58:45) to that again being interrupted again being I didn't say nothing to him play so now it it didn't say you're
(58:53) an Israelite by your skin tone color ism is something that was created primarily
(58:58) in America before America but mainly in America of light-skin versus dark skin
(59:04) XYZ like that we don't look at a brother and because he's super duper light we say you're not an Israelite or because
(59:10) you super duper dark you are Israelite okay so how do you verify it that's what we want to know how do you know problem
(59:15) I we I answered that already I said it goes by your father if on your father's
(59:20) side you're ethnic Israelite yeah then you're a Israelite for example bar Mary
(59:26) would be looked at as black or Jamaican to most he's not to us ethnically he's a white man because he has a white father
(59:33) okay I understand so I just got to ask but I was I was interrupted earlier when
(59:38) we talk about Israelites and we talk about ethnicity ethnic Israelites you do
(59:43) have to still follow after Christ so when when we when I interrupted you earlier um and I was saying it's not
(59:51) just a physical thing I want to clarify what I meant it's not enough to be a Israelite you have to be an Israelite
(59:57) that's obey like all the things that Christ said to do that applies to Israel Christ out of his own mouth said I am
(1:00:04) not sent but to the lost sheep of the House of Israel he never said he was sent to everybody and what I want to
(1:00:10) point out since we talking about racism because that's where I was really interrupted at when I brought out when
(1:00:16) you said we have the same ideology as the colonizer the colonizer had a we going to enslave everybody to build our
(1:00:23) kingdom up and force them and Lynch them kill them you show me where Israelites have that same ideology we prophesy what
(1:00:31) the Bible says so in Revelations 2 when it says in 2 and 26 when it says Gall
(1:00:38) dude so much information we can't even respond to it all yeah yeah so listen manit first of all I'm responding to
(1:00:45) what y'all said what you're saying you you responded Hebrew Israelite to the
(1:00:52) genealogy go back and watch this tape you GNA see that I didn't do all this interrupting I'll let y'all get it out
(1:00:57) no you do you do a different tactic called filibustering but the thing is it's like Fuster all answer I just
(1:01:04) you've answered anything but can you answer a single okay so first of all it's an internal critique at this point
(1:01:10) you're making claims we're critiquing them so I want to know problem yeah great so I just want to know this how is
(1:01:16) it if first of all just very concisely give us the criteria the biological criteria for what an Israelite is and
(1:01:25) then how okay no you didn't because the determination hang on me finish question
(1:01:32) and then you can answer it so the thing is is not only do I want to know the biological criteria you say it goes by
(1:01:39) what an Israelite is that's what is in question for me I would need to know from your view what that is and then how
(1:01:45) you trace your line back to that and this gentleman does too that's what I want to know I answered the question
(1:01:52) answer it again so that I understand I don't know
(1:01:58) why you got to keep talking like if we going to play the [ __ ] role I'll do that like I'm say don't see me doing nothing when
(1:02:05) you say go ahead you straight cap for the white boy even though I'm sat here
(1:02:10) you got a white boy on your side what are you talking about he's not a white boy he looks white to me because you
(1:02:17) suffer from coloring no you suffer from colorism your entire
(1:02:23) ideology why you call White if our ideology suffer from our ideology
(1:02:31) if I our if our ideology suffer from colorism we would have this we would believe what you believe and I would be
(1:02:36) disqualified so that doesn't that doesn't make any s again you're not even attempting to grasp our ideology right
(1:02:44) now Andrew Andrew no we are and no Andrew actually is based off the question that he's asking you're not
(1:02:50) you're just man asking same question because for three hours for for three hour now all of a a white boy three
(1:02:56) hours later that's just because I got under we saw what happened what are you talk listen gorilla you didn't get under
(1:03:03) any skin you still can't disprove you still can't disprove my initial claim
(1:03:09) right you said that God has racist ideologies influence creates thinking thinking creates Behavior so if God is
(1:03:16) the ultimate being obviously he's going to be the first influence so God is going to influence his racist ideologies
(1:03:21) on the people no bro it doesn't make any sense man it doesn't make sense that question directly if God put Israel
(1:03:28) Above All Nations what does that say about
(1:03:33) him you said we're not answering your question directly that's to you if that's like a open that's like a loaded
(1:03:39) question what does it say about him God said God question God said I chose you
(1:03:48) to be Above All Nations you're saying we're teaching that Israel is supposed
(1:03:54) to be above All Nations so if we can read in the Bible that God said Israel
(1:04:01) is Above All Nations what does that make him we also have many other scriptures
(1:04:07) that I've already read that it shows SCP talking about I can answer your
(1:04:12) scripture with another scripture that's what I'm going to do are you ready so here we go stop it stop it no stop it
(1:04:18) listen stop question we got acts 10:34 uh through 35 then Peter began to
(1:04:25) to speak I now realize how true it is that God does not show
(1:04:32) favoritism but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is
(1:04:39) right inwardly not outwardly y racist okay so hold real Qui hold hold on real
(1:04:47) quick C real quick now Andrew said if you're not a prophet you have no right to interpret scripture so why are you
(1:04:54) allowed to come here read scriptures and interpret them to us if you're not a prophet prophecy he talk my prophecy to to well
(1:05:02) so to in what I what I was doing was an internal critique again I was asking you don't you need to be a prophet in order
(1:05:09) to interpret prophecy a prophet can he interpret that what prophecy can he
(1:05:15) interpret prophecy is interpreting he's not interpreting inter acts 10 for the record is Peter's
(1:05:22) vision right it's Peter having a vision so that's a prophecy so he's interpreting a prophecy why aren't you
(1:05:27) disqualifying him well it's not prophecy that was
(1:05:34) Revelation [ __ ] are you saying that are you
(1:05:40) saying you're saying that prophecy very next verse in Acts 10 when you read the very next verse in Acts 10 the word
(1:05:46) which God sent unto the children of Israel that word wasn't sent to everybody and why is he saying that
(1:05:52) because Israel was scatter talkinger get interrupted man like why why interrupted
(1:05:58) me I didn't interrupt you the brother scripture yeah you're talking well you just switch the goalpost from Peter to
(1:06:05) Israel itself wait wait wait slow slow down Swifty I read the next verse in the
(1:06:11) chap booking chapter that he went to he read 34 and 35 I said let me read
(1:06:18) 36 in question because we get context okay what's the prophecy question so
(1:06:24) when it said so in verse 35 when it says in every nation that fearth him it's the Israelites in every nation because
(1:06:31) that's who the word was sent to it's just that simple so so hang on so we
(1:06:36) back to my question now so I go over the actual scripture with listen I just want
(1:06:42) to talk to fi go ahead goe I answered your acts the
(1:06:48) 10th chapter by reading the very next verse and showing you that that word was sent to Israel now I'mma ask you my
(1:06:53) question again when God said that the children of Israel was Above All Nations
(1:07:00) what does that make God what does it make God when he said
(1:07:05) that God's chosen people was above other nations does that are you saying that does that make him a racist I'm asking
(1:07:12) that mean I'm asking you what that mean yeah well I'll answer it with the scripture let's not use my own
(1:07:19) understanding I'll do what you guys do I I read a scripture Revelations 14:16 Andrew listen if they play these games we can play it back Revelations 146 so
(1:07:26) then I saw another Angel flying in midair and he had a Eternal gospel to
(1:07:32) Proclaim to those who live on the earth to Every Nation tribe language and
(1:07:39) people you get what I'm saying so even even an angel so what are you talking about bro so it's like this is what I'm
(1:07:45) saying real quick let me lay my plane real quick let me just lay my plane we can go scripture for scripture like
(1:07:51) we've been doing before you came in cap and even before you came in gorilla we could go scripture for scripture that
(1:07:56) isn't really my argument here my argument is very simple my argument is
(1:08:02) based off of meta ethics right so interpreting uh the way you're
(1:08:07) interpreting these scriptures is racist you've already admitted that God is a
(1:08:13) racist or has racist ideologies so think about it if influence creates thinking
(1:08:20) and thinking creates uh action and God we are made in God's IM so if God is a
(1:08:26) racist then obviously we were all born Adam and Eve they didn't even freaking
(1:08:32) have to bite the Apple they were already racist they were already out brother hey
(1:08:37) brother I appreciate you bringing me on the live if I can here's the thing man y'all don't want to go back and like
(1:08:42) even like think to the epistemology of where you got your knowledge from because it just doesn't it doesn't it's
(1:08:47) not it's incompatible with your morals is incompatible with your morals can I just ask about who's an Israelite and
(1:08:54) who is I'm going to if I could uh to the brother I appreciate you bringing me on your platform I really do I'll gladly
(1:09:01) come back because this was an impromptu one but I think these conversations good if I get this close I'll take about 60
(1:09:07) seconds just to close out for sure no no sweat if y'all haven't subscribed to the brother's Channel make sure you
(1:09:12) subscribed this was an excellent uh conversation I don't have no issue the only thing I just want to point out is
(1:09:18) every time we bring out a scripture that shows God's separatist they run to a instead of at
(1:09:24) least saying God was I would respect it more if you said God was separate here
(1:09:29) but he changed his mind here I would even accept that I would we've had these
(1:09:34) discussions though I agree to it though I got you go ahead trying to tell before
(1:09:40) you came questions yeah that's why I'm so the reason why I'm saying what I'm saying is because every time I went to a
(1:09:46) verse and even when gorilla brought to a verse in my time on your Live you wouldn't answer the question you would
(1:09:51) just run to another verse and that's what y doing I'm not I have not done that I've only brought out Deuteronomy 7
(1:09:58) and6 you went to acts 10 I addressed your acts 10 and then you went to Revelations 14-4 I mean 14-6 when I went
(1:10:07) right back to the verse that I asked you that you did not answer but if you ever want to set up a dialogue I'm captain
(1:10:12) tazar y you can find me on Instagram on YouTube I would love to come back on your platform shout out to gorilla Hebrew that's it was nice it was nice to
(1:10:19) meet you no bad blood at all yeah no bad blood man yeah no problem y'all take it easy peace I'll bring up another Hebrew
(1:10:25) Israelite um let's bring up the one I was on before uh so it's even okay um
(1:10:31) gorilla I think you wanted to can I just ask uh real quick because gorilla is right I am legitimately trying to
(1:10:39) understand the worldview I don't even think it's fair to critique it unless I understand it there are things I've
(1:10:45) critiqued that you've said that I do understand but in this case in the for Israelite
(1:10:51) lineage what do you do to demonstrate your lineage that you are in a Hebrew
(1:10:56) Israelite okay so in the book of Ezra 2 um when somebody didn't have
(1:11:02) documentation for their lineage uh priests would go to an oracle right uh
(1:11:07) the Bible tells us that the law is also an oracle it can be utilized to see things right so when we go into the law
(1:11:15) and we look at the very specific prophecies that were said to befall the descendants of Israel in time past and
(1:11:21) we measure that up with people in the modern time we take a look at who fit the qualifications which there are
(1:11:26) multiple they're not vague it's not one or the other there's literally specifically in Deuteronomy 28 from the
(1:11:33) 15th verse all the way to the 68th verse very specific things that were said to
(1:11:38) negatively befall the descendants of the Israelites right so we take a look at the the people groups in modern times
(1:11:44) who fit the description whose history is consistent with that description and then if you have that's why we were
(1:11:51) asking about like the the ships like okay I see that's but but but that's
(1:11:56) often what's postulated but that's the last one there's 15 that's yeah there's more I understand I get it I get it so
(1:12:03) let me ask you about this thing goad if you're patrilineally descended from the
(1:12:10) people groups that are identifiable with those that's how we're determining if somebody's an Israelite so how so so
(1:12:17) then the question becomes you you can utilize your lineage then to fit the
(1:12:25) criteria for each of these things yes okay can you go ahead and do that for us
(1:12:31) can I give you an example Deuteronomy hang real quick uh real quick let him go
(1:12:36) go ahead yeah so if if we take a look at the totality of the curses there
(1:12:41) specifically we can look at all of the things happening to black Hispanic and Native American people right so my
(1:12:48) direct lineage comes from just very quickly I just want to make sure I got this right Deuteronomy what 28 15 to 68
(1:12:57) that would be like a primary and and just for the record are you familiar at all with Dr Michael Brown no okay well
(1:13:04) Dr Michael Brown is one of our foremost biblical Scholars on the planet Earth he's a Jewish Christian and I've I've debated him
(1:13:11) publicly on this topic um to who has a legitimacy to a claim of being
(1:13:17) Israelites the black who we are saying the Israelites or the ashkan aim and this been debated publicly almost two
(1:13:23) years ago hundreds of thousand people have seen this okay so
(1:13:28) um I'm I'm actually trying to I just want to make sure that I get the criteria correct and that we can go
(1:13:34) through it so uh the Lord will drive you and the King set you over to a nation are am I in the right area here uh if
(1:13:41) you're in 28 yeah I mean but it's it's 15 on down all the way to 68 okay 15 on down so curses for
(1:13:48) Disobedience yes so you're using so I see so to understand this correctly you're using becau because it would be
(1:13:55) really hard to like Trace each individual's ancestry yes that far back I get it okay so what you do is you're
(1:14:01) using the curses of Disobedience and if this applies in a general sense to your people group you would assume that that
(1:14:08) would those would be the Black Hebrew Israelites would be would be the Israelites s the Hebrew Israelites I
(1:14:13) just used to the term Black Hebrew israelit because everybody that we're we're identifying with is not um
(1:14:19) necessarily classified as black and Blackness does not denote being isra
(1:14:25) like necessarily I see so you will be cursed in the city and cursed in the country your basket and your needing
(1:14:32) trial will be cursed the fruit of your womb will be cursed and the crops of your land and Cals okay you will be
(1:14:37) cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out now if I could demonstrate for you that each and every one of these
(1:14:45) that you have provided for me can apply to an other people group for instance uh let's say a specific white people group
(1:14:52) would you then claim that they also were Israelites so so again like I said um if somebody could demonstrate at least the
(1:15:00) majority of those curses um bef falling their particular people group so not a
(1:15:05) select one or isolated one but the totality or like I said at least the majority then we would have to consider
(1:15:12) we would minimally have to consider them being Israelites somebody somebody's skin color does not disqualify them from
(1:15:19) being of the Israelite lineage so Native Americans would fit this criteria yes okay and uh what what are broadly
(1:15:26) considered African-Americans and Africans themselves actually would fit this not Africans themselves but I would
(1:15:32) say more so Africans of the diaspora you know people who are victims of the transatlantic slave trade so people
(1:15:37) African-American you know throughout the Americans but not limited to the Amer talking about the subsaharan region basically yeah some of those people who
(1:15:44) who were sent the other way as well okay but this would also apply to uh Arabs correct no no this would not apply to
(1:15:52) certain Arab groups uh other then if you want to look at certain people like afro
(1:15:57) Iranians um the uh kadim and Yemen I I would I would consider them but like not
(1:16:03) broadly the Arabs no now my last question here is is this historical meaning that it predates Christ meaning
(1:16:11) that do do these criteria only apply post Christ or would the criteria
(1:16:16) retroactively go back to also identify pre Christ you oh okay okay I'm
(1:16:23) understanding uh yeah yeah they they could it could be in any time because if we look in the Book of Daniel during the
(1:16:29) time of Daniel in B in the Babylon Exile he said that these curses have befallen so these curses Cally uh befall Israel
(1:16:37) during times of Disobedience so we can look at any time after Moses gave this and we could identify um so so any okay
(1:16:44) so it stops at Moses I guess that was that was my where's the threshold it stops at Moses yeah okay so it goes back
(1:16:50) to Moses anything forward of Moses who is inside of this people group that has these curses Afflicted to them to their
(1:16:57) people group you would have to then consider them to be an Israelite yes okay well sir I just want to let you
(1:17:03) know that I'm looking through the criteria here and I would say that you could essentially apply this to almost
(1:17:09) any people group post Moses who does who no longer exist I mean almost almost all
(1:17:16) of them in fact uh you will be cursed when you come in and curse when you go out this is very vague right this is
(1:17:22) vague uh the Lord will send you curses confusion re and everything you put your hand to until you are destroyed come to
(1:17:28) sudden ruin this has happened to culture after culture after culture I I mean this broadly seems to me like it could
(1:17:34) be applied to almost any now extinct people group post Moses so so so Andrew
(1:17:41) um I I've now this will be the third time of me stating this it there's there's now what what's what's 15 what's
(1:17:48) 68 what's that 50 something verses with various things so you're reading the first couple and you're yeah you you we
(1:17:55) can take a look at those isolate them and vaguely say well this applies to many people I'm talking about the curses
(1:18:01) lifted listed over the course of 50 verses once you get and you could do it and and and here's the thing in my
(1:18:07) debates I've did a compiled itemized list of these things went over each of them individually and demonstrated the
(1:18:15) specificity and the uniqueness to the people who were claiming to be the Israelites right but you said it has to be patal right so so so so I won't
(1:18:23) accept the broad stroke you you would have to do that and you listen that's totally fair to
(1:18:30) categor hang on to ask me to categorize these for specific people groups that's totally fair I'm not disputing that okay
(1:18:36) that's a fair way to ask for the for the for the debate to be done to structure it for like the Spartans or the you know
(1:18:42) whatever the people group is that I want to apply it to my the criteria though is it does have to be patrilineal right yes
(1:18:49) okay if that's the case then then how does this apply to Hispanics because the Spaniards themselves were a white group
(1:18:56) patrilineally they impregnated females who were South American they're known as
(1:19:02) misos that's Mexicans almost all Mexicans are mysos so how in the world would this like apply to mysos yeah you
(1:19:09) said lineage the lineage comes through the father that's through the father it has to be that's a lot of white men
(1:19:15) whole lot that that doesn't that also happened to black people in America it happened all over the place so there's
(1:19:21) not a disputation of that so we're generally speaking about people and then of course there has to be a like it says
(1:19:27) in job 88 an inquisition towards people's lineages right very simple so
(1:19:33) we we would have to make a lineage Inquisition but also to Broad stroke that all Latinos come from span your
(1:19:40) forefathers is also is hold but for example The Mexican
(1:19:45) government has has rejected the term myso and they don't believe that it ethnically accurately describes the the
(1:19:52) bulk of people in Mexico right no that is not true The Mexican government has rejected
(1:20:00) the term miso but that doesn't mean that that's why that's why there's only that's not what I'm disputing that the
(1:20:05) Mexican Government for no but there's a reason why the Mexican Government made that move to talk about the people in
(1:20:12) their country because they don't feel like it ethnically accurately describes Mexicans but let's back up because I
(1:20:19) agree for the purpose of political correctness The Mexican government has made all sorts of different racial classifications cuz he white people live
(1:20:25) in Mexico like let's be real that's why they want to make a lot of different ethnic allocations there's tons of white
(1:20:31) Mexicans this phenomenon is nothing new blond hair blueeyed Mexicans all over the place not a new thing MOS though are
(1:20:39) indeed and we have the historic record of uh when the Spaniards came and began
(1:20:45) conquering Mex they speak Spanish for God's sakes the Spaniards came and
(1:20:51) colonized uh all of that South American region all of it the myo is definitely a
(1:20:57) mix between a white Spaniard and a native who was in South America
(1:21:03) almost hang on hang on only MOS not Mexicans MOS themselves that is their
(1:21:09) lineage and if it's patrilineal then you would have to say that those Spaniard men they would have to be necessarily
(1:21:17) included in this people group because they were the ones who were betting all of the maidens sir oh okay so so Andrew
(1:21:24) um you you're you're clearly not comprehending so if no I'm G to help you out so when the Spaniard who was betting
(1:21:32) the maiden for example then entered and and planted his seed in that Maiden then
(1:21:38) that child is not of the ethnic group right it's it's it's just that simple so
(1:21:43) anybody who that's a case of who comes from that like I grew up in Southern California I'm very well acquainted with
(1:21:50) the Mexican community and culture me too so so in understanding that I know different mean families and some are
(1:21:57) Spaniards and and they're proud of it right most of them that come from Spaniard lard are proud of it versus the
(1:22:04) ones that come from indigenous lineage right or for example when you have an importation of the black slaves who were
(1:22:10) predominantly male that came they mingled with the indigenous women that had babies there so there were plenty of
(1:22:16) mingling so again it's not absolute every Latin American or every black American is an Israelite but there needs
(1:22:23) to be linear in what I'm saying is that the the most of most of these mixed race
(1:22:28) uh groups what we consider mixed race groups especially in South America and even here in the United States the
(1:22:35) there's literal and and we know the reason why this this is the case but for
(1:22:40) most black Americans there's white DNA there too because of what was going on on these various plantations okay that
(1:22:47) that is the case so if this is the case then in this case any of those children
(1:22:52) who were conceived were we're probably the slave master is going to be a man
(1:22:58) and is going to be white and then this this breaks the Patra lineage that it
(1:23:04) breaks it just like hang on just like it would for the mysos so this is this
(1:23:09) actually incoherent no no and I'll explain why it's not incoherent right because you're
(1:23:15) taking an absolutist approach and that's just not the way history works for example my great great great grandfather
(1:23:22) was a descendant of a Slave he a slave master had a baby with a slave that's a
(1:23:28) white a daughter right my grandfather then was allowed to marry the slave
(1:23:33) master's daughter who was a product of so that happened plenty it wasn't just an absolute uninterrupted line of white
(1:23:40) men laid with indigenous or black women and that's been a perfect line all the way down that's not what happened in
(1:23:45) order for that that individual to be absorbed into the black or brown population they would mingle with that
(1:23:51) and again I I actually understand what you're saying yeah I actually understand what you're saying you're saying and
(1:23:56) this makes sense right you're saying from a patrilineal standpoint let's say a Spaniard came over and you know forced
(1:24:03) himself on a native woman and then three lines down though uh that that you know
(1:24:09) The Offspring of that married uh somebody else who was in this this line
(1:24:15) now that's the new Patron so it's still patrilineally reintroduced that's what
(1:24:20) you're saying right yes sir here's the problem what percentage is required
(1:24:25) there's no percentage required it's literally patal it's not predicated upon percentage that's what we're it's I'm
(1:24:32) not going nowhere I'm just gonna get my charger right quick I'm just second don't take me down so if
(1:24:38) there's one drop one drop of of like 1%
(1:24:44) just 1% DNA which would apply to any of these people groups correct 1% of the
(1:24:51) DNA from the father then would qualify as being an Israelite that's how Patel
(1:24:57) linius Works got it that's every human being on planet Earth debate over so the
(1:25:04) Trap that's the end of the debate bro so if you like that clip and you want to watch more click right here but if you
