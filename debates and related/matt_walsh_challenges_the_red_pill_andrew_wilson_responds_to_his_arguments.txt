() 
(0:00) We've got the argument going on here
(0:01) between the tradcons and between the red
(0:03) pillars. So the tradcons have come back
(0:05) out and Matt Walsh is presents his
(0:07) arguments here. So I'm interested to see
(0:10) your take on this
(0:11) which Andrew Tate describes and promotes
(0:13) where men have children
(0:16) fluff with him on Twitter by the way
(0:17) about this.
(0:18) When was this?
(0:19) Uh this was yesterday. We were arguing
(0:21) back and forth me and Matt Walsh.
(0:23) All right.
(0:23) Where I told him essentially like stop
(0:25) stop being a wuss about this and just
(0:27) directly confront these guys. Like I'm
(0:29) so sick of hearing the polygyny debate
(0:31) and it's been at the undercurrent of it
(0:32) and it's time for a few of us to just
(0:34) directly uh debate and confront those
(0:37) ideologies so that we can just show
(0:39) people how stupid they are. As a
(0:40) commenter rightly pointed out, we enders
(0:42) game it, right? We just destroy it so
(0:44) badly that people don't bring it back up
(0:45) for a while.
(0:47) Right. Okay. Well, would you be willing
(0:49) to you would obviously be willing to do
(0:50) the debate. Do you think that Matt Walsh
(0:52) would be willing to do this debate?
(0:53) I don't. And what's funny is like I'd be
(0:56) willing even to do it on Matt Walsh's
(0:57) side against Myron and Andrew Tate and I
(1:00) think we would win, but I don't think
(1:02) that he would do it.
(1:03) Well, he's not a debater, Matt Walsh. He
(1:05) struggles. He doesn't need to be.
(1:08) I'm a good debater. I can carry it with
(1:10) him.
(1:11) Yeah, but that's what I'm saying though.
(1:12) If you were to prep him before it on the
(1:14) various different points,
(1:15) then I think it would be a strong
(1:17) I agree. We'd be ready to go. Y
(1:20) has lots of historical precedent. It
(1:22) does. uh this is the way that primitive
(1:24) societies have operated for thousands of
(1:26) years and today this strategy if we can
(1:29) call it that is very popular in certain
(1:31) communities in this country. It is very
(1:34) popular. I will say that much. And just
(1:35) from me uh sort of on my travels and
(1:38) everything, I meet obviously a lot of
(1:40) young guys. And these conversations tend
(1:41) to come up a lot. And I have met a long
(1:43) a lot of young guys recently who have
() 
(1:45) been saying this. I'm not going to get
(1:46) married. What I'm going to do is I'm
(1:47) going to have multiple wives. I'm going
(1:49) to have multiple wives in different
(1:50) countries. These sorts of things. It's
(1:51) it is becoming very popular because
(1:53) I'm going to let you in on a secret.
(1:55) Yeah.
(1:55) Because you're a you're a young guy,
(1:58) right? This was popular when I was
(2:00) young, too.
(2:01) Yeah. And it was popular when Gen X was
(2:04) young, too.
(2:05) And the thing is is that what happens is
(2:08) this, right, Jake? You go and you sew
(2:11) all those wild oats and then by the time
(2:14) you hit your 30s, especially your
(2:17) mid30s, you start to go, wait a second,
(2:19) I don't have any purpose whatsoever in
(2:22) life
(2:22) and then you end up completely
(2:24) reforming. The idea is is that by the by
(2:27) I mean the the this idea that this is
(2:30) just now resurgently popular it goes in
(2:33) waves go just like when I was younger.
(2:36) You think that there wasn't you think
(2:37) when I was a kid there wasn't people
(2:38) playing the field weren't advocating for
(2:41) polygyny weren't living the they called
(2:43) it the rockstar lifestyle then
(2:45) right? We're going to have drugs and
(2:46) lots of sex and this and that. You know
(2:48) what I mean? That's a rockstar
(2:49) lifestyle. And again, only available to
(2:53) very few people, right? And all of those
(2:56) rock stars all reformed. It's so funny,
(2:58) isn't it? After they were all done with
(2:59) their 90s rockstar lifestyle, they all
(3:01) became Christians, right? They're all
(3:03) singing Christian music and hymns and
(3:06) like that. They all reformed their
(3:07) asses real quick when they figured out,
(3:09) wait a second, this is a purposeless
(3:12) life. H it's interesting because it
(3:14) reminds me of a conversation that we had
(3:16) when I was in Santa Barbara last time
(3:17) and I said, "Andrew, you know, I'm
(3:19) getting into that stage of my life. I'm
(3:20) nearly 30 now. What should I be looking
(3:22) for in terms of marriage? I want to be
(3:24) able to settle down at some point." And
(3:25) I was expecting you to give me the
(3:26) laundry list. But instead, you said to
(3:28) me, um, "Oh, you're not ready." And I
(3:30) was like, "Well, screw you, dude. Who
(3:31) are you to tell me I'm not ready?" But
(3:33) now I I kind of I kind of understand
(3:35) what you mean by that in the sense that
(3:37) there's a part of you that has to die.
(3:39) Um, and I think that a lot of young guys
(3:41) will interpret this as some sort of a
(3:42) death of the soul, death of the spirit,
(3:44) end of the masculine lifestyle, but
(3:46) there is sort of a part of you that that
(3:47) has to die in a healthy way, I guess.
(3:49) Well, there's a it's the materialist
(3:51) side. Once you once you realize that you
(3:54) can have everything you want, you
(3:56) realize that you don't really want
(3:57) anything. And so, the thing is, it's so
(4:00) funny about that is uh think about the
(4:02) thing a material thing that you've
(4:04) wanted more than anything. You've just
() 
(4:06) always wanted it. And then the day
(4:08) finally comes where you get it, you lose
(4:10) interest in it really quickly. That's
(4:12) just how it is. Can you think of
(4:13) anything that you really wanted that you
(4:16) got it and you're still as interested in
(4:17) it today as you were when you got it?
(4:19) Well, the worst part is you're
(4:20) interested in it for 5 minutes if that
(4:22) when you get it and you're like, "Oh,
(4:24) That's a f."
(4:24) Guess what though? That's not the case
(4:25) with a good wife, is it?
(4:27) No.
(4:28) You don't just lose interest, do you?
(4:29) They're just as important the day you
(4:31) get them as the day you lose them. So,
(4:33) uh, this is the this is the important
(4:35) distinction between the material pursuit
(4:37) and the idea that we can just take
(4:39) spiritualism completely out of the human
(4:42) experience and pretend it doesn't exist
(4:44) and pretend that purpose is only
(4:45) material cuz it's not.
(4:47) Yeah. Well, what did you mean when you
(4:48) said you're not ready? Was it not ready
(4:50) in the sense that the priorities aren't
(4:52) there, the roots aren't there, that sort
(4:53) of thing? What does a guy need to to do
(4:55) to be ready?
(4:56) They have to kill off the materialist
(4:58) aspect of themsel. They have to realize
(5:01) that the things which are important to
(5:03) them don't actually exist in the world.
(5:06) And once you once you realize that that
(5:08) most material things are just completely
(5:10) unimportant and always have been because
(5:13) you can't obtain them, you realize that
(5:16) you up the whole time. You
(5:18) up the whole time and you fell for a big
(5:20) lie which was that any material pursuit
(5:22) was going to ultimately be in some way
(5:24) fulfilling. It never is. Look at the
(5:26) lottery curse, Jake. You ever heard of
(5:27) the lotto curse?
(5:29) Yeah. Yeah. How is it that people who
(5:30) had nothing can finally get everything
(5:32) that they ever wanted and the most
(5:33) miserable that they've ever been?
(5:36) It's because it's because once you have
(5:38) access to all the material things you
(5:40) could ever want after your your needs
(5:42) are met, right? So like you need to have
(5:44) water and food and shelter, right? Those
(5:46) are your material needs and some form of
(5:48) recreation. You need to at least have
(5:50) those things. But past that, when you
(5:52) get into the pursuit of thing I want,
(5:54) right? You realize that once you get
(5:56) that thing, you lose interest in it
(5:58) almost as fast as you got it.
(6:00) Almost as fast as you got it.
(6:02) Kind of a terrifying thing though
(6:03) because that is like something that's
(6:05) genu genuinely like a struggle for for
(6:08) guys to to kill that part of themselves,
(6:10) the materialistic part. And if there's
(6:11) not an incentive and there's and if
(6:13) there's not a clear path in terms of
(6:15) killing that side of you, then I can see
(6:17) why guys would get super tempted into
(6:19) the lifestyle of just of of keeping that
(6:22) until their 40s and 50s and they're
(6:23) wearing like a tacky suit at a bar at 50
(6:25) years old.
(6:26) Yeah. But doesn't a kid your age when
(6:27) you see a guy in his 50s living that way
(6:29) think in your head he's pathetic?
(6:31) I do. Yeah.
(6:32) Yeah. That's what all of you guys always
(6:33) tell me that that the 40, 50, even early
(6:36) 60s playboys driving around in the
(6:38) muscle cars with the 25year-old, you
(6:41) know, basically prostitute on their arm,
(6:43) they look at me and say, "Oh, that guy's
(6:45) pathetic." And I'm like, "What's the
(6:46) difference between him and you except
(6:47) the number in your ears?"
(6:49) Yeah. It's so true, man. It's so true.
(6:51) It's so true. Yeah, it is kind of
(6:53) pathetic. And when you see uh and also
(6:56) when you when you interact with these
(6:58) people it's like it's especially for
() 
(7:01) women I find that it's almost a
(7:02) necessary part of the maturation process
(7:04) of a human being to actually give that
(7:06) to be selfless in that way if you know
(7:08) what I mean
(7:10) it's a part of who
(7:12) it's like a necessary part of the
(7:14) maturation process of a human being to
(7:17) to then have that sort of ego death.
(7:20) Yeah. Well, it's just that with age
(7:22) comes the idea that most of the
(7:25) that you wanted is because somebody else
(7:26) had it.
(7:27) Yeah.
(7:28) That 99% of the that you want in
(7:30) life is because somebody else has it and
(7:32) you don't. And once you once you realize
(7:34) that and you stop caring about what
(7:36) other people have and care instead about
(7:38) what it is that you actually value, you
(7:40) realize that you don't value very much.
(7:42) That's why the older you get, the more
(7:45) you see us old guys saying like, "I
(7:47) don't care. I don't give a I don't
(7:50) care." You know what I mean? Don't care.
(7:51) Don't care. Don't care. You'll hear this
(7:53) commonly. The older I get, the less I
(7:55) care about things. That's not true. It's
(7:58) just the the older you get, the more you
(8:00) care about things that matter, and the
(8:02) less you care about everything else,
(8:03) which almost and almost nothing matters.
(8:05) Once you realize that, then you're
(8:06) ready.
(8:08) And you could always spot those
(8:10) communities because they're the ones
(8:11) that are the most dysfunctional, the
(8:13) filthiest, most destitute, and
(8:14) crimeridden places in the country. Show
(8:17) me the murder rate and the average
(8:18) yearly income in any neighborhood and I
(8:21) will tell you whether most of the
(8:22) children in that neighborhood have a
(8:24) father in the home or not and I will
(8:26) never be wrong.
(8:28) Andrew Tate talks about this kind of
(8:29) lifestyle as though it's natural. In a
(8:32) post on Sunday, he made that claim
(8:33) explicitly. He said, quote, "Mogamy
(8:36) isn't natural for men. We are not
(8:39) monkeys or lizards or sharks. We are
(8:41) human beings. And my controversial
(8:44) contention is that we should act like
(8:46) it.
(8:47) Well, and by the way, there's something
(8:49) here which reinforces Matt that he's not
(8:51) bringing up
(8:53) that if it's the case you're coming from
(8:54) this from a red pill perspective,
(8:56) non-religious, then you're adapting
(8:59) evolutionary psychology, which mean the
(9:01) key point of this is what? Evolution,
(9:03) right, Jake? M.
(9:04) So, how can you ever say that if it's
(9:07) the case that half the world practices
(9:09) monogamy, you that men did not evolve to
(9:12) practice monogamy?
(9:13) Of course they did. That would be part
(9:15) of the evolutionary process. So, to say
(9:17) that that's not natural would actually
(9:19) be stupid. That makes no sense, right?
(9:22) It would it would absolutely have to be
(9:24) part of the natural world that we
(9:25) evolved towards monogamy or we wouldn't
(9:27) engage in it.
(9:28) Yeah. And if the idea is to reproduce
(9:30) and survive as well, well, I mean, we
(9:32) have to reproduce our society. And
(9:34) what's the best way to do that?
(9:36) Yeah. Exactly. What's the best way for
(9:38) it to thrive?
(9:39) Yeah. Yeah.
(9:43) Supernatural.
(9:44) Man and wife become one at the altar.
(9:46) They are bound together by the vow they
(9:48) made before God.
(9:51) This is above our base instincts.
(9:55) And so is composing a symphony or
(9:57) sculpting the statue of David out of a
(9:58) massive hunk of marble. These things are
(10:00) achieved just like any great thing is
(10:03) achieved by rejecting temptation,
(10:06) subordinating our base desires,
(10:08) embracing some measure of hardship for
(10:10) the sake of something far greater than
(10:11) whatever momentary pleasure we can
(10:13) experience by giving into them. And
(10:16) there is nothing in this world more
(10:18) manly, more masculine than that. In
(10:20) fact, I would say this is the very
(10:22) definition. So this is where he gets it
(10:24) wrong.
(10:24) At least in my opinion, this is where he
(10:26) gets it wrong. So he's talking about the
(10:28) hierarchy of duties in men, right?
() 
(10:31) However, there's no obligation for men
(10:34) to fulfill this higher duty of moving
(10:37) themselves away from base instincts and
(10:39) moving themselves into the maturation of
(10:42) assisting women at at their expense. if
(10:46) women are not also moving towards the
(10:49) same virtues and duty. So if it's the
(10:51) case that uh one whole half of society
(10:54) is not encompassing those same virtues,
(10:56) what obligation do you have to do so?
(10:58) And this is the question that Matt will
(11:00) stumble on over and over and over again
(11:02) and most people on my side will as well.
(11:04) Right? So what's the answer then?
(11:05) because I think that he does make a good
(11:07) point that in terms of what is manly and
(11:09) masculine being if if you're materialist
(11:12) and everything that you do constantly
(11:13) goes inwards then it sort of almost eats
(11:15) away at you. But if you are taking your
(11:18) masculine virtues and if you're
(11:19) expressing them outwards and and towards
(11:21) family and community and these sorts of
(11:23) things and I think that's a much more
(11:24) masculine thing because it sort of
(11:25) expands endlessly.
(11:27) Yeah. But in the encompassment of that
(11:29) masculinity does that mean that you uh
(11:31) give give your resources to people who
(11:33) are undeserving of them?
(11:35) Sometime undeserving is probably the key
(11:37) word there. Yeah. People in need maybe,
(11:40) but undeserving is the key word.
(11:42) Probably not. No.
(11:43) Yeah. But who determines that people in
(11:45) need deserve it?
(11:46) You, the person
(11:48) who has the resources gets to make that
(11:50) determination, right?
(11:51) Yeah.
(11:51) In other words, you don't have, Jake, a
(11:53) duty to give to people who are in need,
(11:54) do you?
(11:57) Um, well, as a as a as a Christian, you
(12:00) have some sort of a duty to to tithe,
(12:02) right?
(12:03) Sure. But this isn't that supposed to be
(12:06) used responsibly towards people you
(12:07) think uh deserve to have that coming
(12:10) towards them or in some way you're
(12:13) dispensing the charity towards a person
(12:15) because you think that they can do good
(12:17) with it. You wouldn't dispense charity
(12:18) to somebody you thought was going to do
(12:20) bad with it, right? Like you're not
(12:21) going to give a bum 20 bucks to go buy
(12:22) booze, are you?
(12:24) No. No. Yeah. So
(12:25) So you don't There is a duty there.
(12:27) There is a duty there, though.
(12:28) Yeah, maybe. But but who gets to
(12:30) determine when it's fulfilled?
(12:33) You do. Yeah. Yeah, you do. Right. So,
(12:35) that's that's the case that the red pill
(12:36) is making here. Who gets to make the
(12:38) determination as to which women are
(12:42) deserving of these characteristics and
(12:44) virtues and are deserving of the
(12:46) resources? It's not the women that get
(12:49) to determine that. It's us who gets to
(12:51) determine that. And I think that that is
(12:53) one of the key parts that's been missing
(12:55) from the Christian ethics side.
(12:58) So, but what is actually the
(13:00) counterargument here? What is what
(13:01) should Matt Walsh say uh in regards to
(13:04) this? So, he's saying that it's the most
(13:05) to take over. What do you mean the same
(13:07) thing? The same thing we've always been
(13:08) needing to do. You take the over. You
(13:11) tell Christians it's perfectly
(13:12) acceptable to boycott. It's perfectly
(13:14) acceptable for you to discriminate
(13:16) against uh people who don't share your
(13:19) values. Nepotism is totally acceptable.
() 
(13:21) The fact that you can flood the polls
(13:23) and get people with your values in
(13:25) office and they're going to be
(13:26) discriminatory towards those who don't
(13:28) have your values is totally fine. That's
(13:31) the answer. The answer is to take that
(13:34) over and then you institute your
(13:36) force of will the same way the
(13:38) opposition has been for the good of
(13:40) everybody.
(13:42) This whole black pill, we're just going
(13:43) to give the up that. Yeah. Roll it over
(13:47) for Take that over. You take
(13:49) it over.
(13:51) Feel like running through a wall right
(13:52) now.
(13:54) Hell yeah.
(13:55) You do the harder thing for the sake of
(13:58) the greater good.
(14:01) If you're going to impart one thing to
(14:03) your sons and your daughters as a
(14:05) father, it should be this.
(14:08) Teaching them how to do the harder thing
(14:11) for the greater good.
(14:14) And if you can't or if you won't, then
(14:17) you aren't manly.
(14:18) See, I disagree with that, too. And no
(14:19) matter how much
(14:20) see uh I I agree that you should you
(14:23) should teach people especially men that
(14:26) they often will have to embody um a
(14:30) harder thing in life for greater virtue.
(14:33) That's that's not with dispute. But you
(14:35) know with wisdom you find something out
(14:37) right is that half the time you don't
(14:40) have to engage at all.
(14:43) Half the time you don't even have to
(14:45) insert to watch it fall. Right? And
(14:48) that's the easiest path in fact in many
(14:50) cases. So what I would say is this. You
(14:53) want to impart the greatest virtue in uh
(14:58) a boy right the greatest virtue to teach
(15:00) him is wisdom. That's the greatest
(15:03) pathway to virtue is wisdom. Is knowing
(15:05) when not to act is just as important as
(15:07) knowing when. So something maybe your
(15:09) fighting instructor told you at some
(15:11) point Jake knowing when not to fight is
(15:14) just as important as knowing how.
(15:16) That's the art of war. Sun Sue win the
(15:18) battle without without firing a gun or
(15:20) without
(15:21) right without firing a shot.
(15:22) Yeah. Yeah.
(15:24) Much money you have or how much you can
(15:25) bench press doesn't matter.
(15:28) Now Tate says that men will be men and
(15:30) yes that's true. But
(15:33) will they be good men? Will they be men
(15:36) of virtue and fidelity and discipline?
(15:39) They can be if they pursue the higher
(15:42) thing. In a similar way I might say that
(15:45) many men will father children. And
(15:47) that's easy to do.
(15:49) But will they be fathers?
(15:51) But you notice that baked into this,
(15:53) he's not telling you why that's the
(15:54) higher thing to do. Only that it is.
(15:57) And that's and that's the problem,
(15:59) right? Is like you can't just make the
(16:00) statement that it is the higher virtue.
(16:03) You have to state why it's the higher
(16:05) virtue.
(16:06) And actually, I can help Matt's argument
(16:08) out a little bit here. The determination
() 
(16:10) of men versus women's virtues. You ju
(16:13) you can just look at it this way. It's
(16:14) really simple.
(16:16) If you key in the absence of a single
(16:18) virtue for an entire sex and the and
(16:21) look at the kind of conceptual effects
(16:24) on society which are detrimental, right?
(16:27) We can then associate which are
(16:29) masculine virtues and which are feminine
(16:31) virtues and which are higher and which
(16:32) are lower. Here's an example of this. Uh
(16:35) if men tomorrow, all of them stop doing
(16:39) their job of defending the population,
(16:41) there's no population.
(16:43) It's gone. So idealism like courage as a
(16:47) virtue, things like this have to be
(16:49) masculine because if women give up on
(16:51) the duty of defending the nation, who
(16:52) gives a It's not that important,
(16:55) right? Could it have a detrimental
(16:57) effect? Yes. But the way that you would
(17:00) associate that that's a masculine versus
(17:01) feminine virtue is look at the effects
(17:04) when that when one sex drops that virtue
(17:06) and then you'll see why it's associated
(17:08) with one over the other. So the reason
(17:10) you should calibrate towards the higher
(17:11) virtues. These would be the things which
(17:13) would have the most compelling effect
(17:15) around uh everybody in society if you
(17:17) don't encompass them would be these
(17:19) keynote masculine virtues. And that's
(17:21) why you should move towards them because
(17:23) if everybody in society does you're
(17:25) going to have a way better society.
(17:28) So you can't just make the assertion but
(17:29) you can show why we have good reasons
(17:31) for this. Yeah, I think it's a really
(17:34) good point, especially when you're
(17:35) looking at masculine virtues and why we
(17:36) need to follow them and these sorts of
(17:38) things because when you look at the red
(17:40) pill argument and when you look at the
(17:42) black pill argument, it is actually
(17:43) quite compelling because there are a lot
(17:45) of aspects of the modern world which a
(17:47) young man might look around and say,
(17:48) well, things kind of look like they're
(17:50) collapsing around me. It seems as though
(17:51) the game is rigged against me. Why do I
(17:54) need to embody these virtues? Like, what
(17:56) are these virtues that you're talking
(17:57) about here, Matt Walsh? And why is that
(17:59) important for me? Why don't I just grab
(18:00) grab the bag and run sort of thing. So,
(18:03) there needs to be that
(18:05) to to address there's a chatter who's
(18:07) spuring out because I spend my wife's
(18:08) paycheck on guns, right? I thought you
(18:11) rejected materialism, Andrew. Rejection
(18:13) of materialism doesn't say that you
(18:15) can't have material things or even value
(18:17) material things, but that you shouldn't
(18:20) only value those things. And in the
(18:22) hierarchy, they're at the lesser end of
(18:25) valuing the things which are spiritual.
(18:27) So for instance, would I give up my wife
(18:29) or my guns first, stupid? Which is the
(18:32) answer to that question, you idiot?
(18:34) Which is the answer? Because if the
(18:36) answer, you dumb, is that I would give
(18:39) up the guns before the wife, then I
(18:41) don't value the materialism, right,
(18:43) dummy? And these people, people like
(18:46) you, like you are why it is that people
(18:49) like me make the kind of money that I so
(18:52) I can buy that many guns. By the way,
(18:55) it's because of people like you. Without
(18:57) stupid
(18:59) like you, I would never be in the
(19:01) position of being able to do what I do.
(19:04) And for that, I thank you.
(19:06) Thank you, sir.
(19:07) They have children. We salute you.
(19:10) That's the hard part. Now, I I keep
(19:13) talking about hardship and difficulty.
(19:15) Rightly so,
(19:16) but I don't want to make it sound like
(19:18) being a faithful husband and father is
(19:19) nothing but misery and drudgery, and all
(19:21) you can do is just grit your teeth and
(19:23) bear it. This is another important point
(19:25) coming up here I think from Matt Walsh
(19:27) in the sense that this is often spoken
(19:29) about from the common denominator of
(19:31) that well there's misery everywhere and
(19:33) how are we going to sort of deal with
(19:34) our misery? No one it's hard to sort of
(19:37) imagine the real positives of it until
(19:40) you have it. I guess people say that you
(19:42) don't know what it's like to be a father
(19:43) until you hold your baby. You don't know
(19:44) what it's like to be married until
(19:46) you've been married for 10 years and
(19:48) these sorts of things. I don't think I
(19:49) could really imagine that or like really
(19:52) visualize the joy of it if that makes
(19:53) sense.
(19:54) Well, maybe not in its fullest capacity,
(19:57) but I think you can imagine it in some
(19:59) sense, Jake. So, for instance, um you uh
(20:03) you deeply loved your father.
(20:05) Yeah.
(20:06) And you deeply love your mother,
(20:09) right? So h how how is it that it would
(20:11) be like impossible for people to
(20:14) envision how their parents must feel the
(20:16) opposite direction, you know, like you
(20:19) fought, I'm sure, with your father, you
(20:20) fought, I'm sure, with your mother,
(20:22) fought with your siblings, but you
(20:24) wouldn't replace any of that, right?
(20:26) No.
(20:26) So, how could that be any different with
(20:28) your own child?
(20:29) I guess it's the responsibility and the
(20:31) fact that you made that person, you have
(20:33) this, you know, responsibility over
(20:35) their life and their well-being. Like
(20:36) I've never had any responsibility over
(20:38) anyone but myself. So
(20:40) yeah I mean that's not true though.
(20:42) Don't you have an obligation to your
(20:43) brothers?
(20:44) I do. Yeah.
(20:45) Yeah. So there's some responsibility
(20:47) which is baked in there between all of
(20:49) you as well. So it's like look when it
(20:51) comes to family dynamics while you might
(20:53) not be able to envision or experience
(20:56) the full joy of having your own children
(20:58) yet I think that you can still envision
(21:01) what it must be like as you had parents
(21:03) yourself and siblings yourself. Right.
(21:06) All right, let's watch a little bit of
(21:07) more of this and then I do want to cover
(21:08) I know we're getting a bit over time,
(21:09) but I do want to cover a little bit of
(21:11) the tweets between Myron and Matt and uh
(21:13) then Hillary Crowder is tonedeaf.
(21:15) You guys can go as long as you want.
(21:16) How are you going for time, Andrew?
(21:19) Yeah, we can go for a little bit longer.
(21:20) We were uh you know, yesterday was kind
(21:22) of a cluster, so we kind of cut the show
(21:24) a little bit early, like maybe five
(21:25) minutes early.
(21:26) Um and I I today is just kind of a Yeah,
(21:29) it's kind of a makeup day. We're just
(21:31) kind of um
(21:33) kind of making everything up. Because
(21:35) it's Lumbberg from Office Base.
(21:37) It's a makeup day.
(21:39) Kind of a
(21:39) That sounds
(21:40) Yeah, because Well, Lumbberg from Office
(21:43) Base sounded kind of gay.
(21:44) I'm not wearing makeup, Andrew.
(21:46) Yeah. Yeah. Show me mystery.
(21:48) That's not the case. I love being
(21:51) married. I love being a dad. It's It's a
(21:53) lot of fun much of the time. It's a
(21:54) source of great joy.
(21:57) That's what happens when you simply let
(21:59) go of your childish need to put your own
(22:01) immediate gratification before anything
(22:02) and everything all the time. Now, this
(22:04) bit I can kind of understand because I
(22:06) did see the actual joy that my dad had
(22:08) when we we were growing up and kicking
(22:09) the footy, playing sports. He like just
(22:11) loved having three boys. It was just the
(22:13) the center of his existence was his
(22:14) three boys. These sorts of things. Now,
(22:16) that would be fun. And maybe that would
(22:18) be something to um to sort of add into
(22:22) the messaging as well, I guess, when
(22:23) you're talking to young guys like it's
(22:25) actually fun and cool having kids. It's
(22:27) a it's a fun thing, you know.
(22:29) Can I ask you a question, Jake?
(22:30) Yeah. Why is it that chatters think that
(22:33) me going off of them isn't uh like 10%
(22:36) of the reason that people tune into my
(22:37) shows? Because they just love watching
(22:39) me rip you to shreds. I don't know why
(22:42) they think, but anyway, go ahead.
(22:43) Yeah, agreed.
(22:45) You discover an ability to do the harder
(22:47) thing and actually enjoy it.
(22:51) The way that guys like Tate describe
(22:53) marriage makes it seem like, you know,
(22:54) we're living in entirely different
(22:56) universes. and perhaps are
(22:58) because he describes marriage like it's
(23:00) a labor camp. A man is imprisoned by his
(23:02) controlling, ungrateful, promiscuous
(23:04) wife who runs out to cheat on him as
(23:06) soon as he leaves for work in the
(23:08) morning. He makes it seem or outright
(23:09) claims that it's essentially impossible
(23:11) for a man to find a good, faithful woman
(23:14) who will bear his children.
(23:15) See, this this is all This
(23:17) pisses me off because it's a straw man
(23:19) and it's a it's the totality of a straw
(23:21) man which annoys me. It's like, look, I
(23:24) I believe that Matt is correct that
(23:27) Andrew Tate is wrong on this, but I'm
(23:29) not going to strawman his position
(23:31) because that's not how you beat that
(23:33) position. You beat it by steelmanning it
(23:35) and then you win after it's been uh
(23:38) after you've steelman the position. So,
(23:41) uh what t what Tate says is not that
(23:43) there's an impossibility that you'll
(23:45) ever find a good wife. He doesn't say
(23:47) that at all. It says it's improbable in
(23:49) modernity when you have everything going
(23:51) against you for women to not have
(23:52) incentives to both leave you, screw you
(23:55) over, and cause serious and significant
(23:57) damage to you with very little that you
(24:00) can do to mitigate those effects. And so
(24:02) you should look for alternative routes
(24:03) to marriage, which is a reasoned
(24:05) position. I don't know why these guys
(24:07) keep pretending that that's not a
(24:09) reasoned position because it is. It's a
(24:12) reasoned position. Can you beat it with
(24:14) better reasoning? Yes. But you can't
(24:16) straw man this or you lose
(24:18) immediately.
(24:19) Yeah, I agree. It definitely is a reason
(24:21) position and a lot of the stats uh do
(24:24) favor that these days in terms of
(24:25) divorce rates and these these types of
(24:27) things as well.
(24:28) Yeah, he's got good points on a lot of
(24:30) this stuff. Like you don't The nice
(24:31) thing the fun thing here is is like and
(24:34) this is all female influence in the
(24:35) space of women getting upset by the
(24:37) things Tate says and then right-wing
(24:38) creators get pushed back from their
(24:40) stupid female audiences and think they
(24:41) got to plate them, right? I have no such
(24:45) inhibitions. You can get the out
(24:47) of my chat tomorrow. I don't give a
(24:49) what you think about what I'm saying
(24:50) because of what I'm saying is true. You
(24:53) cannot steal man this guy's position.
(24:54) And you cannot take away from Andrew
(24:56) Tate that a lot of the risks that he's
(24:59) talking about and a lot of the things
(25:00) that he's talking about and the unique
(25:02) challenges which are faced by this
(25:04) generation are not things which are
(25:06) being addressed for them. They're not.
(25:08) They're just objectively not. And
(25:09) because of that, and unless you can beat
(25:12) Tate in the realm of ideas that people
(25:14) can gravitate towards, he's going to
(25:17) beat your ass. He's going to beat your
(25:19) ass on every single front. Maybe
(25:22) physically, mentally, everything in
(25:24) between. You have to be prepared for
(25:25) that. And this is I get frustrated when
(25:28) these guys straw man the position
(25:30) because you don't need to. You can beat
(25:31) it legitimately.
