(0:00) what's up guys we are live so we have a pretty [ __ ] epic debate for you today I guess it's gonna be uh much overdue I
(0:07) think uh discussion so me and Marcus are going to be going against Andrew and Richie uh Richie uh I don't think most
(0:13) of my Channel's familiar with you so you want to give a quick introduction uh sure man um my name's Richie
(0:20) um I've attempted stuff on YouTube I'm just too busy for it to be honest I just really enjoy these debates I'm from um
(0:27) more of a traditional I guess conservative perspective generally speaking that's about all
(0:32) cool all right so um I think we we were talking about earlier we're going to discuss uh sex before marriage and what
(0:39) was the other debate proposition we're talking about oh they're your props Alex
(0:45) well remember we talked last night we came up with that one I think we have one more yeah I I don't remember they were your
(0:51) props okay let's start off with let's just talk with sex before marriage and then
(0:56) the conversation can evolve as it goes uh yeah okay so let's let's I guess
(1:01) let's just do like a 30 second opening statement so everyone knows where we're at you can make it up to a minute or two and then it'll just be uh free for by
(1:08) the way Andrew where are you supposed to get Ahmad I was not able to pull a mod off this
(1:13) evening unfortunately so we're gonna have to act like the big

(1:28) uh Kaz if you're if you're listening right now if you got time you want to come on and moderate this debate that'd

(1:48) uh okay this person
(1:53) I can ask oh I can ask your favorite person correct tomorrow I know you guys are really close so I
(2:00) think it'll be good okay I don't I don't have to like him as
(2:06) long as he's a good as long as he's a good moderator I don't give a [ __ ] no no I'm kidding all right Ashley said yes
(2:12) I'm gonna give her the link thank you
(2:17) I think we can all agree Ashley will be fair all right let me send her the link
(2:25) foreign
(2:34) actually jump on and then we'll get started we can we can do opening statements while we wait for Ashley to come on so
(2:41) uh yeah let's just kick it off uh you want to go first Andrew yeah I can do that okay my name is
(2:48) Andrew Wilson I'm the host of The One and Only Crucible it is to my knowledge
(2:54) the fastest growing debate channel on the internet whose content is primarily
(2:59) debates um I am a what would broadly be conceived of as a Christian nationalist
(3:05) uh political debater and um father of five happily married my position on
(3:12) marriage is actually pretty simple uh that hey I don't really understand why secularist d-gens do it at all since
(3:18) it's a religious Sacrament and two that secular Degen should stop being secular Degen so that they can get married and
(3:25) the reason for that is if you take a look at their happiness indexes they seem to do a lot better men do a lot
(3:31) better when they're married women do a lot better when they're married and the most important part is that
(3:36) children do a lot better when they come from homes of married people if you're talking about marriage in general by the
(3:44) way the second topic was no fault divorce Alex if you remember correctly I have it written down so I just wanted to
(3:49) check my notes but anyway how did you make it so mysterious well I couldn't remember I just checked out I got him in
(3:56) front of me so overall I think that marriage is good for Humanity I think that it's good for
(4:02) men I think it's good for women it's definitely good for the dynamic family unit and I think that we need more of it
(4:11) not less of it and I think that men have a duty to shirk the pornography and the
(4:17) [ __ ] and the uh kind of progressive selfish nonsense and start families it
(4:23) is a duty that we have it's not just some imperative which uh relies on your
(4:29) own personal choice your ancestors most of them could not actually spread their seed only somewhere between 40 percent
(4:37) of men traditionally have been able to even reproduce most men have not been
(4:42) able to do that that's why men have almost twice as many female ancestors as they do male ancestors so now when you
(4:50) have kind of the perfect arraignment which has come up where you have an almost perfect equilibrium in the
(4:55) population between men and women uh you can actually have one wife per
(5:03) man which I mean this is fan fantastic news for men but seemingly within the
(5:08) what I call dgn pickup artist Irina they seem to really shirk that off and push
(5:14) it away for sexual exploitation and for basically just just uh selfish Hedonism
(5:21) and I think that that should stop and I think that um that that's not a masculine uh way to go about life so uh
(5:29) the other thing is I want to bring this up kind of in the opening which is feminism so I want I'd like to
(5:36) to point out my wife for a moment um my wife has almost single-handedly
(5:41) changed the narrative throughout the entirety of YouTube politics and twitch politics when it comes to feminism her
(5:49) research her books and her debates have now been adopted by academics globally
(5:54) and uh her book seems to have become a must read for people who are against
(6:00) feminism when you kind of look at this you start to understand that the reason she did
(6:05) this was because she had a duty to do so her Duty was to make sure that her
(6:11) daughters were not set up in the same trap of feminism as so many other men's daughters have been in the last hundred
(6:18) years I'm always hard on feminists on this channel I beat the holy tar out of them every single chance that I get and
(6:25) they deserve every bit of it but I think that the degens who are throughout the
(6:30) manosphere also deserve to get to take their licks on this because uh in many ways they contribute to the same form of
(6:38) feminism that they're trying supposedly to stop or that they're trying to push against and I think that um that
(6:45) basically all of them have a share in the modernity of what I call the great
(6:51) [ __ ] up society which is what we're living in right now so I'd like to push back on a lot of your ideas about
(6:57) marriage about a lot of your ideas about um you know sexual exploitation and
(7:02) things like this which I consider to be um quite frankly revolting so I'm glad
(7:09) that Marcus is here Marcus don't take any of this personally I'm going to be very hard on you tonight just like I am
(7:15) everybody um but that's just the way I am and with that I'll turn it over
(7:21) uh working Europe uh yeah I wasn't quite clear like I got both of those propositions but uh so
(7:29) we're just we're just gonna focus on the effect before marriage for now and then we'll move on to the second one later
(7:34) um okay um man now you're [ __ ] me out because I had a whole nother thing all right
(7:41) that's all right um generally speaking the promiscuity
(7:47) before marriage even outside of a Christian faith standard it leads to
(7:52) um almost effectively so long as there are no contract laws in in marriage um it leads to almost the same thing as
(7:59) polygamy in other societies that is to say that a large percentage of the men or rather a small percentage of the men
(8:06) are getting the majority of the available sex and what that leads to is a societal dysfunction you have a
(8:14) large percentage of men maybe 30 of them that are totally sexless have no prospects for marriage Etc
(8:21) um this is one of the reasons that polygamy is effectively banned in most western Society it's sort of like
(8:29) teetering in Utah it's like sort of a misdemeanor now because of the Mormons you know but um by and large in Western
(8:35) Society is polygamy is banned because of this outcome when you have a huge percentage of the population of young
(8:42) men with testosterone and angst without an outlet to uh no prospects whatsoever to uh obtain
(8:49) them obtaining sex or women or marriage um they do violent things they get
(8:55) increasingly desperate um it's totally societally destabilizing and um
(9:02) yeah I mean just if we're talking strictly about marriage I think that's probably the number one point that I'd stick on
(9:08) okay um do you want to go first Marcus or you want me to oh you doing man
(9:13) so Richie I pretty much agree with everything you said we're just going to have disagreements on the prescription
(9:18) Andrew did a lot of virtue signaling in his speech by the end of the day we can all agree that sex is a key part of
(9:24) marriage dead bedrooms are a big cause of divorce get married getting married without having sex is like starting a
(9:30) business partnership without ever meeting that person it can work out but the odds are lower there's many women
(9:35) that you can will not be compatible with sexually and otherwise and if you blindly ignore that and get into a
(9:41) marriage which is definitely risky for any successful man then you're just setting yourself up for a higher chance of failure
(9:48) cool um yeah I I agree with Alex I think you want to do everything you can to make
(9:54) sure you have the right person before you're getting married um I think you need to find out as much as you can about them I think you should
(10:00) live with them I think you should have sex with them I think sex is a very important part of how you're going to
(10:05) interact with another person romantically and to forego that I think it's a little risky for me
(10:11) um in terms of uh what Richie was saying I I would argue a little bit here in
(10:17) terms of I think if you do have a society with a lot of casual sex as opposed to just having a society where
(10:23) everyone is monogamous I think you're still going to have a percentage of men that are just clueless with women having bad relationships and bad marriages
(10:31) um so I think actually encouraging people to learn to be in relationships uh to learn to have better sex to learn
(10:37) to interact with their partner in a better ways is what's going to help that as opposed to just say all right
(10:42) everyone needing to partner up cool all right so we can get into the open Panel portion of it actually you
(10:48) know we all trust that you so moderate uh step in when you see necessary I guess I'll start with this Richie
(10:53) because you you might like to I'd like to push back if you don't mind yeah but you did in your opening
(11:00) statement you talked about sexual compatibility and that's [ __ ] so let's start with sexual compatibility
(11:05) where where you start off in this debate saying that you think that that's extremely important but you negate to
(11:12) express that sexual compatibility with a partner grows over time regardless of if you've had sex with them before you got
(11:18) married so when you talk about sexual compatibility that's something which increases over time anyway you don't
(11:24) have to go and take the woman's virginity before you marry her in order to have a successful marriage in fact
(11:31) the stats say otherwise don't they Alex the stats say that if you marry a virgin your marriage actually turns out to be
(11:37) pretty good most of the time so sexual compatibility builds up with two people over time it's not just oh well I gotta
(11:44) I'm must [ __ ] her because if I don't there's just no way for me to know that I'll be sexually compatible with a woman
(11:49) by the way you're sexually compatible with almost all women okay men almost all men are sexually compatible with
(11:56) almost all women the plumbing is universalized Alex okay there's a let me
(12:01) respond to everything you said so there's some half truths in what you're saying all right that yes you can build sexual compatibility over time but if
(12:08) you're really not sexually compatible you need unisol Foundation to build on so if a girl is super into like kinky
(12:14) BDSM role play and you're super vanilla you're not gonna probably not gonna find a milligram there needs to be that compatibility there needs to be that
(12:20) chemistry in terms of the second thing you said about divorce when you actually look into the data it does seem that for
(12:26) women having more sexual partners increase their chance of divorce but for men having more sexual partners does not
(12:31) change your risk for divorce yeah but it's a good thing that uh marriage has two people in it huh Alex men and women
(12:37) so the stats apply to both of them and if the stats apply negatively to one then they apply negatively to both
(12:46) but the advice to men is still going to focus around if they're married the same
(12:52) advice you'd give to women because a marriage takes a man and a woman last time I checked Alex so that's the first
(12:57) thing and then the second thing when you're talking about again sexual compatibility if this is all porn Degen
(13:03) brain coming out of your mouth well what if I'm into kinky [ __ ] well if you weren't inundated with pornography being
(13:08) directly beamed into your [ __ ] skull 24 hours a day likely you would not be into all that BDSM [ __ ] it seems like
(13:15) someone who's never really had good sex thinking that he knows a lot about sex oh geez that's a great Burn yeah sounds
(13:22) like somebody who hasn't had a lot of sweet Alex
(13:28) I know that you're I know that you're a DJing so we have to do this I'll just do it right off the bat I've had sex almost
(13:34) every day of my life for 16 [ __ ] years straight including before marriage
(13:39) well the in my in my particular case yes I did but so what so it doesn't make me it doesn't make me
(13:45) it doesn't make me a hypocrite to say that I was a recovering drug addict and so then advocating against drugs Alex
(13:51) that makes no sense it's a bad argument it's a stupid argument I don't know where you came up with it well it seems like you want your cake and eat it too
(13:57) so it's like okay I wanna I wanna enjoy myself I'm gonna [ __ ] all these girls uh but
(14:04) now that I'm married I'm just gonna say other guys should do it again that's the same argument you would
(14:10) use against the the recovering drug addict you'd be like well you want your cake and eat it too you got to go out all the fun with the cocaine how come I
(14:17) can't go have all the fun with the cocaine too because the person who was the former cocaine addict says because it's bad you [ __ ] that's why well you
(14:24) know drugs have a negative impact on your life physically so does pre-marital sex and there's no doubt that that's
(14:31) true well we can go over all of them we've already discussed STD rates when you're talking about STDs these are
(14:37) things which you just shrug off and pretend they don't even exist yes there's no big deal Andrew there's things called condoms you put them on
(14:43) your dick and they prevent you from getting STDs they're not 100 effective that's the one thing and you yourself
(14:49) have admitted that you've contracted STDs even though you wear condoms well this was before I started wearing
(14:55) condenses when I was like in my mid-20s all right just post that no so no guys are getting are getting yeah right no
(15:02) guys are getting any STDs even though they're still even though still they are
(15:07) even though they're wearing condoms do you think that now right now someone puts a condom on properly and
(15:15) then they still get in the CD that's okay by getting hit by a car okay drive to
(15:20) work even though there's a chance a drunk driver can kill you I'll demonstrate this I'll just demonstrate it you're not
(15:27) gonna drink you're gonna take a reasonable precautions but if you're someone who's really paranoid you could also get an SCD test before you have sex
(15:33) people I'll demonstrate it Alex if you you can right now would you say that
(15:40) um STDs are on the rise or on the decline uh I believe they're on the rise last
(15:46) time I checked they're on the rise and so the thing is though is that the amount of training given to children now
(15:52) for how to protect themselves from STD is at an all-time high so people know
(15:58) what protects them from STDs and condom use and um birth control all of these things are
(16:04) also used more than they ever have been in history yet STDs are still increasing so okay okay people know that exercise
(16:12) is more important than ever we have enough information on that yet most of the country doesn't exercise we know bad food isn't good for you A lot of people
(16:18) eat fast food and the problem is that most of those guys they're just not wearing the condoms right you can give people all the information in the world
(16:24) but it's not going to utilize that information it's not going to help them right you can talk about any kind of epidemic STDs drug use obesity all that
(16:32) is on their eyes even though we have more information than ever I think that's okay so a symptom of pornography basically
(16:38) um like why why is it acceptable to have having all these multiple partners increasingly you have young women doing
(16:44) only fans doing like hyper degraded things because that's what gets them attention
(16:50) um but you had said earlier it's like you you know or uh I believe Marcus did that uh you know we want to have
(16:57) multiple sexual partners because we need to make sure we're sexually compatible before marriage but wouldn't that also ultimately tend to lead to more and more
(17:05) depraved sex uh no I don't think so my sexual preferences have been pretty stable for
(17:10) the last 10 years I don't escalate in what do you mean by depressed yeah
(17:16) and it is a bad word for you guys because I don't want to do the whole Theocratic thing but um
(17:21) um more and more deranged thing like so naturally um men have this impulse to have sex
(17:26) with women men don't naturally have an insect an Impulse to have sex with their anuses for instance right but because
(17:32) it's like promoted and you got a girl that's into it maybe you think that they could just oh well I don't know because
(17:38) like I I this girl loves giving me hickeys on my left eye later like whatever it is right like just it it
(17:44) needs to have more and more of a sensationalist appeal because your your ultimate goal effectively is Hedonism
(17:50) your the pleasure that you're obtaining is the goal Richard but you would agree that people hundreds of years ago had
(17:57) Kinks right or you would disagree yeah where do you think these Kings come from not to the same no not to the same degree we know for sure what pornography
(18:04) Marcus does to your brain we know that it desensitizes you just like exposure to violence does over exposure to
(18:10) violence will desensitize you to Violent actions the same way that pornography desensitizes you when it comes to being
(18:17) able to sexually orgasm among other things and just like all forms of dopamine hits to your brain you
(18:23) constantly need to graduate higher and higher and higher in order to receive the same amount of dopamine men were not
(18:29) reporting sexual dissatisfactions or women at the same exact rates not even close uh since this data has been being
(18:36) compiled pornography is definitely a problem it rewires I think we can all
(18:41) agree we're watching a [ __ ] ton of Poland is going to degrade your sex life I think we all agree with that I don't
(18:47) think that those that are having pre-marital sex or watching lesson will
(18:53) porn I don't see we can all agree that if we could all
(18:59) agree wait a second wait a second wait a second hang on I'm sorry rich I don't mean to cut in but you're good I just I
(19:05) just want to know because your argument Alex was indeed that sexual compatibility was the most that's the
(19:12) most important thing it's necessary Marcus says the same thing I never said
(19:19) it's the most important thing okay you said that sexual compatibility is indeed important okay at least it's important
(19:27) okay so so the thing is man is if we're looking at that and your idea which Alex
(19:32) said is what if you have a different Kink than that that chick over there well these Kinks and this type of thing
(19:38) that is probably something which comes from pornography if you're not explosion
(19:43) you're not exposed to those things pre-pornography how the [ __ ] would you even know that they're a kink of yours
(19:49) makes no sense bro we're making straw man arguments no one here is advocating for porn we agree I think we would agree
(19:54) that some of that stuff is fueled by pornography but there's a big difference between watching shitload of porn and
(20:00) having sex with your partner they're not the same thing you're not listening to me do you believe that people had Kinks
(20:08) before porn of course but so what so that's what we're saying regardless
(20:15) of porn or not people are going to have kinks they're going to have preferences even if it's not what about the race preferences right about the rates
(20:22) no one's arguing with you against that it's a little bit of a red airing like that's not a red herring it is because
(20:28) we're we're all agreeing with you that porn is [ __ ] [ __ ] up in general but okay but not really because your sexual
(20:35) compatibility argument is to say you're putting the cart before the horse you're saying listen what if you have all these
(20:40) weird funky [ __ ] Kinks and most most of the time you wouldn't even know that those Kinks existed if he didn't have
(20:45) access to the pornography showing you those things I think yeah precisely like imagine like there was like a town
(20:51) Harley in Rome that was like running around licking people's buttholes and everything well first of all they did all kinds of friends
(20:57) they did all kinds of [ __ ] up [ __ ] in Rome in Greece right right just as an example right like I don't know maybe
(21:03) there's a town harlots or like an oracle told them that I don't whatever I think
(21:08) they were doing more [ __ ] up uh [ __ ] up [ __ ] in like ancient Greece than we do now but yeah I I don't think that the
(21:14) average person uh was actually doing Mega [ __ ] up [ __ ] because uh a man
(21:19) that they were made love to a man's sexual drive is inherent in his biology it's something that we were gifted and
(21:26) cursed with that's how we make babies right that's what makes us it's what motivates us to to do the right thing
(21:31) like it's it's in our DNA licking buttholes is not all right like that's something that somebody was like got
(21:38) into and like told other people about like Ashley Baxter disagree yeah I I
(21:44) don't think you can really prove that there there weren't Kinks before porn I agree that sure if people are watching a
(21:50) lot of porn maybe they discover a little bit better what they like maybe it accelerates and they need a high level
(21:55) of the extremity of what they're doing but to suggest that sexual compatibility
(22:01) wasn't an issue before porn I think is crazy I think even if you take vanilla people you will find that they say they
(22:07) have bad sex with another venerable person even if you take kink out of that completely right some people just aren't
(22:13) compatible sexually like I I will still stand by that Kink obviously adds to that and if you're super kinky it's
(22:19) going to be harder to find compatibility but to suggests that everyone is compatible with everyone else and the
(22:25) only reason they're not is because porn came about I think is like ridiculous well then Marcus why don't you explain to me if sexual compatibility was such
(22:31) an issue how come the divorce rates were pretty much non-existent uh inside of this nation for about 200 years religion
(22:38) social stigma yeah exactly I think so I guess sexual well wait so I guess sexual compatibility was not such a highly
(22:45) important thing in comparison to your religious convictions your duties a lot of those people were Unhappily Married
(22:50) that's the thing exactly prove it prove that they were unhappily married you son of a [ __ ] you have no evidence
(23:00) your assertion you have to prove it in the 60s or 50s there's an epidemic or a
(23:05) bunch of Housewives they can see in and out of drugs because they're so depressed no there wasn't an epidemic of it that's a lie an epidemic of it now
(23:12) is that stick to the question yeah so what you're telling me
(23:19) essentially is the only difference between now and I think you said 200 years ago whenever it was the only
(23:25) difference is that people are having prematural sex and that's why everything is [ __ ] up now is that what you're trying to do no this is one of those
(23:31) like Kathy moments with Jordan Peterson even though I hate that spurg um you're just trying to rephrase what
(23:37) it was that I was saying what I'm saying is that um there are there are many factors but
(23:44) pornography absolutely accelerates them but when you're when you're considering I mean we're we would have to make this
(23:50) a way longer debate to talk about women's rights and all this stuff and like how it's like sort of been subverted but I'm really more strictly
(23:56) concerned with with um the prevalence or the acceptance of of uh casual flings of sexual
(24:04) intercourse before marriage um the body counts uh so for instance the marriage rates
(24:10) in 1980 according to the U.S Census Bureau um 60 of women were married at least one
(24:17) time or they had their first marriage by the time they were 23. in 2015 almost a decade ago this is before only fans
(24:24) uh it was 31 before they were first married that's not even like children that's like married right
(24:30) this is if you both agree that that marriage is conducive to raising healthy
(24:36) children we have a lot more going on than just the pornography like the sex before marriage thing is a really big
(24:42) deal you're actually agreeing with us you're saying there's a lot more to them photography and I agree I would post
(24:47) this hypothetical somebody disagreed let's say let's say we take Emmanuel
(24:53) woman either one of them watches porn and the uh man is into some real [ __ ] kinky [ __ ] he just likes to be super
(24:59) dominant he likes to be violent or not sexually violent whatever the girl is super vanilla she just likes to lay
(25:04) there and do nothing do you think those two are going to work out do you think that first of all
(25:10) uh yeah that is actually fairly common yeah first of all vanilla was actually an example another assertion this is
(25:16) another assertion without evidence show me that it's common well I must have anecdotal evidence but yeah also yeah right there's no [ __ ]
(25:24) evidence here's empirical evidence when they uh poll people who get divorced and I ask
(25:30) what's the cost of divorce uh they say uh sexual uh issues were like I think top three or top four or something
(25:35) they're high up on the list yes but the sexual issues that they're talking about or degradation due to other aspects of
(25:41) marital problems which is why only which is why it's low on the list yes in the exit in the polling for these things
(25:48) when they're discussing them they do indeed discuss that aspect of it and most of the time when they're talking
(25:54) about sexual degradation and marriage over time it's a relationship between other stress factor issues within the
(26:00) marriage that leads to sexual dysfunction or cold bed or things like this it's not a correlate because and
(26:07) here's why well yeah there's men and women really like to have sex you might not know this but they really like it
(26:12) okay I don't know this I have a girlfriend all right well that's my whole point
(26:19) though is like that's not they're not stopping the sexual intercourse uh due
(26:24) to the fact that they're not sexually compatible it's due to contributing other stress factors the number one
(26:29) reason women walk away from marriage is dissatisfaction with money for the most part that's the that's the top reason
(26:35) they normally report that it was irreconcilable differences but it's generally over money money is one
(26:42) because they can because there are no negative repercussions basically on their end there's a lot of negative repercussions
(26:48) they're either married to this they're either married to the state or they're married to uh in another aspect of the
(26:54) state they get child support payments um so the the ramifications the negative
(27:00) ramifications of a woman getting married are much less on on the woman and on the
(27:05) family of the women which is sort of why this behavior is so acceptable nowadays we can agree sorry we can agree that
(27:12) it's less compared to the men we might agree with that but to suggests that it's so small that it doesn't really
(27:18) matter and she will just get like divorce willy-nilly and married again and it doesn't matter I think that's crazy I think women that are getting
(27:24) married it is a huge negative if they end up getting divorced right is it as huge of a name
(27:30) that's huge exactly are they always initiated by women they're basically always initiated by women yeah that
(27:37) there's multiple reasons right one I think is that women typically have to go through the divorce men can
(27:45) kind of sit around but if women have kids and they need to I'm sorry there's feedback going on in my ear yeah yeah actually I'm getting the same and I
(27:51) think it's from maybe Richie Richie mute yourself real quick and let's see if it's from you okay let me me myself
(27:56) sometimes no it's not you it's hang on Marcus say something yeah yeah I'm still
(28:01) getting it I'm still getting it too Alex you tried muting yourself now it's good on my own but I'll try you know all
(28:07) right testing testing testing testing I don't hear anything now yeah this always happens with the microphone
(28:13) let me see let me really quickly fix this uh if I can audio reduce sorry Mark
(28:20) said I didn't mean to cut you off but that's not right it's super annoying yeah it always does this I'll have to
(28:26) switch back to my uh regular audio in which I'll be quiet okay I'll make it work just
(28:35) getting a test test test test Alex say something yo what's up yeah no feedback loop now
(28:42) okay okay yeah I just have to go with my computer mic which is a lot quieter so I'm gonna just try to adjust and turn
(28:47) myself all the way up and turn you guys like 20 down so it's more even you don't need to turn yourself up you sound fine
(28:53) it's the same Audio Level because we were doing the same same Audio Level
(29:00) all right no worries uh all right so as I was saying if women are initiating 80 of the time which I haven't seen that
(29:06) set so I don't know how accurate is but let's assume it is that doesn't indicate um that they are better off or it's
(29:12) really easy for them just to divorce really nearly I think it's probably easier for them or it's more beneficial
(29:19) for them compared to a man but not compared to themselves being in a marriage I think they're probably happier being in a marriage at first
(29:25) um and so I think that's the first thing the second thing is the reason is probably a little bit higher is that uh
(29:31) if you do split women need to get a divorce for that child support right whereas men can kind of just sit around
(29:37) it's not a big issue or not a big rush for them so I think that's probably the biggest reason that's happening but either way even if we do like I kind of
(29:44) do agree with you that it's a lot easier for a woman to get a divorce um than a man I still don't think there's a huge
(29:51) Initiative for women and a huge incentive for them to be like you know what I think I'm just going to be happier marrying than divorce next year
(29:57) and marry again and divorce I I think that's crazy remember what I said when we did our
(30:03) call about the redirecting wait a second wait a second uh so well Alex uh debates
(30:08) and conversations evolved so anyway back to what Marcus was saying and by the way we didn't redirect anything this is a a
(30:15) direct line of inquiry so Marcus uh nobody said or nobody was even
(30:20) discussing which which sex it's easier for uh to get a divorce we're discussing
(30:26) uh whether or not one sex is penalized over the other uh once a divorce is
(30:31) initiated in this particular case it does appear that men are much more heavily penalized than women for the
(30:38) initiation so hang on so how's that not an
(30:44) incentive for them to get a divorce then it's not an incentive okay so if if say
(30:50) we have a business agreement right between me and Alex from playing with fire right
(30:55) um and maybe if I end that agreement uh he will lose two million dollars and
(31:02) I will lose 10 million dollars right it's going to be uh much worse for me but at the end of the day Alex doesn't
(31:09) want to lose 2 million dollars either so he's not going to do that uh he's not going to break up from that agreement
(31:14) essentially so even though I'm much more even like even what if the business no
(31:20) it doesn't make any sense well that's nice that you want to redirect back we're having a question
(31:27) no I'm talking to Marcus about this we're talking about premarital sex
(31:33) you're not the moderator dude Marcus
(31:42) okay and Marcus is hypothetical uh what if the relationship was more something like this like let's say
(31:49) um uh Alex had no prospects of making any money staying with the company but
(31:55) if he leaves the company he gets 600 bucks a month for the rest for the next 18 years yeah
(32:01) would you understand how the power dynamics right listen I I think right that if a woman is really having a
(32:08) shitty marriage and it's awful for her and it's awful for the guy it's going to be a lot easier for her to leave I agree
(32:13) with that we're agreeing with this I'm just not agreeing with the premise that it's really easy and really beneficial
(32:19) for a girl to leave that she's so incentivized that if she's in a happy marriage she's going to be like hey you
(32:24) know what being divorced might be more fun let's do that I don't think literally okay there are literally
(32:29) families like this is called welfare Queens right and it's like you're not supposed to say that but this is what they do so the government will literally
(32:35) incentivize women to have sex and have children with multiple different men and for each man that can't pay for the
(32:42) child support they get a check each month okay so the more children that she has outside of wedlock and has in her
(32:49) house so long as there's no man in the house that's quite literally a stipulation from the welfare
(32:54) she gets a paycheck for each of those kids they're basically farming kids for easy you know how difficult I'm gonna
(33:00) bring this back for a second I'm gonna put this back I want to bring this back that's fine
(33:06) Alex we're not we're not allowed to yeah you can talk about it but like I don't
(33:11) know why you're so determined to avoid the main topic of conversation we're not avoiding anything
(33:17) what does marriage mean you're not talking about economics like we're talking about premarital sex my question is this uh for Richie and Angie what
(33:24) exactly is the downside for a man to have premarital sex there's many downsides okay so the
(33:31) number one downside well go ahead you go ahead you go ahead so the the first downside uh for a man
(33:38) to have premarital sex of course is STDs now you might you can point and say but wait a second some of these things are
(33:44) avoidable right some of these issues are avoidable because you know in modernity we have condoms and prophylactics and
(33:51) things like this but this was not always the case and when we look at the when we
(33:56) look at that we understand that the societies which promoted away from promiscuous sexual intercourse
(34:02) especially with men had much more virtuous societies every single time a man is out there having sex with a woman
(34:09) he's actually devaluing the woman you know that this is true both of you say both of you and I I went and checked
(34:16) Marcus's work out too claim that the more sexual partners a woman has the more devalued that woman is in the
(34:22) marketplace to men okay so if that's true then that means every time a man is out there banging a chick he's actually
(34:28) devaluing the chick under your logic right so that would be bad for society just by itself that would be bad for
(34:34) society so when they actually did studies on
(34:41) this they looked at STD rates between single men and married men they found them to be basically the same and the reason for this is because married
(34:47) people are having sex without condoms right with their wife generally speaking and if their partner cheats on them right then you know the chance of them
(34:53) getting STDs much higher versus typically single men are more likely to wear condoms so the STD rates is the
(34:58) same for married and single men so the first point is mute Now show me the data pull it over you want to see the study
(35:05) yeah especially considering I have I have a counter study from Healthline where Healthline talks specifically
(35:10) about what are called pleasure but Alex finish this point we can pull the studies up
(35:18) I'll pull up the study while uh Marcus Marcus can go back and forth on this let me give me like two minutes I'll pull it
(35:24) up yeah sure uh I would say given your point of devaluing women by having sex
(35:29) with them right this is assuming that everyone is being honest right so if a
(35:36) guy says hey how many sexual partners have you had and the girl's like oh 200 then I think a lot of guys are going to
(35:42) consider that a red flag and don't want to be with this girl and in that sense you could argue that she's less attractive or devalued in your words but
(35:48) the truth of the situation is that if a guy says how many people have you slept with and the goal is going to think that
(35:55) the guy is going to judge her for that then they're simply going to lie about it right they're going to say oh three four like whatever a low number they
(36:03) think the guy will like so yeah so you're basically what about reputation this is the only thing what about what
(36:09) about what about two things first let's talk about reputation which you do is accrue reputation through promiscuity
(36:14) there's no doubt that that's true women always accrue negative reputation through promiscuity they're known as
(36:20) [ __ ] skanks Etc et cetera et cetera not only that though let's move on to the second Point uh which is this doesn't
(36:26) actually address whether or not it devalues the woman the more sexual partners that she has which you are now
(36:33) making the argument that it does no she's not he is and he says if he says
(36:38) let me ask you this if there's a girl that goes around hooks up with every guy at the club by Hooks up I mean kiss uh
(36:45) this but she doesn't have sex with any of them right she makes out with everyone at college she has a tits out
(36:53) half the time but guess what she doesn't have sex with anyone right but then there's one girl that doesn't do any of
(36:58) that sleeps with two guys who do you think is viewed more negatively in this situation
(37:04) okay so I want to make sure I repeat the question back so I don't get it wrong you're asking if a chick is promiscuous
(37:11) if she if she acts in a promiscuous way do you think that that she's going to gain the reputation of being a
(37:17) promiscuous woman is that is that essentially the question I'm saying what would you consider more devaluing for
(37:23) the woman I think promiscuity in general is devaluing to a woman but they have more amount of sexual partners that they
(37:29) have that adds to the promiscuity problem and devalues them further you seem to agree with this because if you
(37:35) state that a woman has 200 Partners creates a red flag for a man then this means the more partners that she has to
(37:41) reach whatever that threshold is the less value she has in the day before she had sex with that new man yeah I'm
(37:46) saying 200 for sure I'd also consider zero when a girl's like 25 years old also a red flag why
(37:53) because if this girl hasn't had sex then I'd be questioning whether once again she's any good at it whether I'm going
(38:00) to be compatible with it and if it's not for a religious reason I'd also tell the red flag wait so the red flag is you're not sure
(38:07) that she could be a great [ __ ] puppet for you go ahead Marcus and finish it
(38:14) I like I like that uh I like that too of course yeah um
(38:19) uh we got this study no I want to finish this though real quick and then we'll get to the study I
(38:25) know you want to know but I want to know this I want to know why it is Marcus that you think yeah so if the goal is
(38:31) zero yeah zero Partners at 25 right and it's not for a religious reason then I'd
(38:37) be questioning if she's had any at all relationship experience right well if she's very inexperienced then chances
(38:44) are she's not going to be a good partner oh wait you just keep it on something he wasn't able to get with anyone but
(38:50) Marcus you just keyed in on something though you said if it's not for religious reason so how come if it's a
(38:55) woman who is staying chased for religious reason that wouldn't draw a red flag for you
(39:02) it probably still would draw a red flag just not as big of a red flag what would the red flag be just that she's not
(39:08) going to be able to satisfy or degenerate sexual needs as well as the horror that's basically what you're saying yeah exactly can we quickly throw
(39:17) out the all agree to throw out the STD argument because it's pure horseshit single man American were found to have
(39:22) the same rates of STD so that your first point is mute
(39:31) I don't know if he likes to be corrected but it's it's moot not mute oh you're
(39:36) good man yeah you can correct me I'll give a [ __ ] for chill uh so so the second thing here I'm gonna Post in the chat right now for you the second thing
(39:43) you were talking about is devaluing the woman so I guess I have to ask for clarification what's this do you mean
(39:48) when you say devalue the woman what do you mean exactly you mean her social reputation what do you mean
(39:54) well yeah I so I think that uh generally speaking women uh as we saw with the
(39:59) poll just here the other night on your channel if a man would prefer to have a virgin even over a woman who had five
(40:06) sexual partners the poll overwhelmingly said stated yes why now why is that and
(40:12) it's a revolting factors the Revolt Factor so most men generally speaking become revolted as you admitted on that
(40:19) same panel by thinking about the fact that the woman that they're with might be having sex with another man or has
(40:26) had sex with other men it's not a thing that you want to dwell on or think about because it causes what I what I think is
(40:32) an impurity imbalance so I think that men generally tend to be attracted to women who have some sort of Purity about
(40:39) them some sort of Chastity about them because these are virtues and men tend to see virtues in other men just like
(40:45) they do in women and what are the virtues we're looking for in women we want loyalty Chastity uh and virtue and
(40:52) those things I think think promiscuity is a good indicator as to whether or not a woman has any of those things
(40:58) especially the virtue aspect promiscuous women tend to suffer from mental illness they tend to suffer from all sorts of
(41:04) issues often coming from single mothers among other uh huge problems so yeah I
(41:10) think that this is a the red flag you're looking at would be virtue based Andrew would you say that you have a successful
(41:15) marriage happy marriage yeah okay but you and your wife both had
(41:22) sex so how do you how do you guys view each other uh positively if you guys both didn't have your virtue when you
(41:28) got married so we're both we both reform to Christianity like so many people do but that doesn't change your body count
(41:35) but yeah so so so what and by the way pointing pointing at pointing at it was
(41:41) attracted to someone but let me tell you I'm going to try to tell you this so that you understand that because this
(41:46) does follow assuming that I can have all things equal and could have met my wife and she's the exact same person she is
(41:53) but had never had sex with a man before me I would choose that and so would every [ __ ] given the choice
(42:01) [Music] marriage even though neither one of you
(42:06) guys had your virtue wouldn't it doesn't mean it's optimal Alex well right right precisely like
(42:11) just there's a big there's a big difference between something being optimal and something being something
(42:17) being a deterrent also you're primarily talking about on a woman's side my initial question was what about for men
(42:22) what are the what are the negative downsides of premarital so ask me the question bro you asked the question I'll give you
(42:29) I'll give you I'll give you a real one I'll give you a real one um so this is my life experience right so
(42:36) anecdotal of course but um initially started off uh in very long-term relationships that split for like
(42:43) military reasons right and uh after that I sort of got jaded and became agnostic and just became one
(42:50) of you guys right and I was just smashing anything and um I'll tell you what it leads to it
(42:57) leads to zero fulfillment basically like if you're if your life is surrounded by
(43:03) satisfying your own carnal Pleasures you become hollowed out inside it I don't
(43:09) care if you're religious or not you eventually become uh very jaded about how the world Works
(43:15) about how women function you stop looking at them as people with like a totally different perspective on life
(43:21) and you start looking them as uh objects right and uh
(43:26) I mean they are I don't get I'm just kidding I'm just kidding um but the uh
(43:32) the uh the reality is like it's it's unfulfilling and the only way that I can
(43:37) see to to feel like connected to to any sense of uh I don't want to do the theologic
(43:44) thing but any any like Soul right like any like I'm I'm doing the right thing I have a purpose in life is is really like
(43:51) serving other people and um you're not serving other people by constantly just finding the next hot piece of ass to
(43:56) smash it doesn't it's where it's it's detrimental to your
(44:01) well-being long term I can tell you there's a lot of married and former married men who are also
(44:08) superb bitter towards women so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna disagree with the fact that there are some single men who live unfulfilling Lives who are not
(44:14) happy but that also happens with married men uh informally married men in fact I think that guys who you know have a
(44:20) unhappy marriage are probably going to be the most bitter and resentful right but this is like this is like the axle
(44:26) argument right like not all X are like that right it's like okay whatever what are the outliers here yeah well right
(44:32) let's let's when it focus on the outlines then for a second right because we've been talking about like very promiscuous women what if we're just
(44:38) talking about um say Richie instead of going through that phase where you were just [ __ ]
(44:44) around you were just trying to get laid there was Zero fulfillment let's say you weren't doing that let's say you were
(44:49) actually looking for a partner and let's say you met someone you've been dating him for a couple of months it's going
(44:55) really well this is someone you can see yourself with and then you have sex right my argument there would be that's
(45:02) not that bad you find out if you're compatible or not if it doesn't work out then it's fine like there's a big difference between someone being like
(45:08) super promiscuous a girl sleeping with like 200 people as opposed to a girl actually just looking to find a partner
(45:13) in a six-month relationship sure sure but we're not arguing about like what's possible we're we're arguing about
(45:19) what's preferable and optimal okay okay let me post this question would you would you guys both agree that causal
(45:26) game moderation yeah sure yeah it's not optimal that you
(45:32) guys drink alcohol right but it's it's not a big deal in moderation but if you guys were drunks who are getting wasted
(45:37) every night then that would not be the same that would be a massive massive negative both in terms of social repercussions and otherwise
(45:45) why is sex any different well this is this is actually a wonderful question so are you saying that's optimal that
(45:51) nobody drank alcohol uh yeah okay well then you've just made our argument for us
(45:59) how do I make your argument for you because we we're just getting done telling you we're talking about what's
(46:05) optimal especially inside of marriage and so when you're talking about promiscuity especially on the
(46:10) promiscuous end you're saying hey wait a second right if promiscuity done in moderation that's not a huge problem but
(46:17) is it optimal that there's no promiscuity under your logic what you just said with alcohol that would be optimism
(46:25) I was trying to draw attention to the fact that things can be okay moderation and not have any deterrence but when
(46:31) overdone or bad you you Andrew constantly choose to indulge in alcohol which is fine right but it but then
(46:37) you're also virtue signaling saying like oh pretty much looks like so bad you got to be optimal but you choose to live your life in a very non-optimal way and
(46:43) I would say alcohol is much worse for you than pre-marital sex even if I had a
(46:49) house filled to the brim with wall-to-wall prostitutes and one was hanging from the ceiling right now that
(46:54) would have no bearing on whether or not my arguments were true or not Alex
(47:09) okay Alex so just to clarify when you made the comment about things being good
(47:14) or bad versus like in reference to moderation right you weren't referring
(47:19) to sex in itself and that you think in moderation it's good or bad you were just trying to attack one of Andrew's
(47:25) arguments from his point of view so you're not conceding that that point of view yeah but I rolled it back
(47:31) I think Andrew knew that but he thought he could get a dunk on me but yeah I did because under your logic my core
(47:38) argument is that premarital sex in moderation is a good thing
(47:43) oh okay so then alcohol it's still drinking alcohol in moderation is a good thing what's in moderation
(47:51) oh wait if it's not Annapolis on hang on if it's not analogous then why did you bring it up as an example Alex
(47:59) I thought it was it was it's not analogous five minutes ago now it's now it's analogous now it's not analogous is
(48:05) it analogous or isn't it you want to choose or if you want no he needs to answer my question Marcus is it
(48:11) analogous I can answer any question I want so I'll need to do anything you're not going to answer you so answer it
(48:17) you just like don't talk for 10 seconds I can answer the question yeah are you done can I answer or you want to go
(48:22) ahead okay so the point I was trying to make is about how things that are in
(48:28) moderation don't have a can not have a social deterrent effect right so for you drinking in moderation does not have a
(48:34) social deterrent effect however alcohol is negative physical qualities which makes it better that you don't drink sex
(48:40) in moderation doesn't have a negative social uh negative effect in extreme if
(48:46) your body count hands if your body counts like 300 then yes I will agree that there's a negative social effect but in moderation it does not so much
(48:53) alcohol however sex doesn't have any negative physical issues hence that the
(48:58) the second part of that doesn't apply do you understand so so I just want to make sure I get this clear okay when you
(49:04) brought up the example of alcohol and you said to me Andrew if you drink alcohol to excess is that a problem and
(49:12) I said yes and Richie said yes okay and then you said what about moderation we said no and he said so the same thing
(49:18) happens with sex I asked you okay well then is it optimal to have no alcohol you said yes so if it's analogous to
(49:24) that then my counter example is also analogous and you are conceding that it would be optimal then do you understand that I have absolutely 100 not conceding
(49:31) that yeah I don't know if you do this on purpose or not maybe I'm not explaining myself correctly okay I was purely talking about social
(49:39) repercussions social image with alcohol in any amount is bad for you physically sex is not bad for your physical I'm
(49:45) calling any amount is not bad for you physically that's a lie
(50:03) you can't bring something up and then when I give you the counter example to the thing you considered analogous two
(50:09) seconds ago and then turn it around on you no stage is no longer analogous that's absurd okay
(50:15) oh my God this is this is so crazy there's multiple one point though I'm
(50:20) gonna that's why I want a clarification from you Alex and then Andrew clarified I will say that I kind of agree with
(50:25) Andrew on this one from a modern standpoint like you did bring up an example he did counter that example
(50:31) right back and that's just that's the way it looks that's fine but again I'm
(50:36) talking about only about social repercussions in that I didn't maybe I should have specified that uh but yeah
(50:42) I'm talking about social repercussions the difference between alcohol and sex once again is one of them has a physical
(50:47) negative effect and one of them doesn't which is why it's different for alcohol uh unless you're Andrew who doesn't
(50:53) think alcohol is bad for you alcohol does in any in any amount is not optimal
(50:58) versus sex is different because there's no negative physical side effects in fact it is a good form of cardio so you can make an argument that's positive so
(51:04) that is the difference for like the 25th time so so then are we going to State then that actually using alcohol as a
(51:12) comparative to promiscuity is not analogous so we can just move on from the point
(51:23) so if I'm using it as a social example then which is what you're using it as and we're talking about the social
(51:29) repercussions of what is optimal and you say zero alcohol is optimal why wouldn't you apply that to promiscuity Alex
(51:35) because I've explained to you like 20 million times because one of them has a physical downside and the other one doesn't it
(51:43) let me try to explain this very simply okay okay when it comes to certain small words there can be I will do my best
(51:49) there there can be physical and social uh negative uh outcomes that follow
(51:55) right with alcohol they're in moderate in a moderation there is not a negative
(52:00) social effect that follows right but there's still a negative physical effect in extreme there's a negative social and
(52:06) physical effect with sex in extremes there's a negative so uh negative social effect in moderation there's no negative
(52:12) social effect but sex does not have a negative physical effect hence why you cannot make the point that just because
(52:18) I say that alcohol no alcohol is optimal no sex is optimal because one of them is physically bad for you one of them is
(52:24) not do is that is that not clicking okay so what's your so what's your overall argument is let me make sure I repeat it
(52:30) back to you you're saying that uh when you're talking about alcohol if you use alcohol in my moderation right that
(52:37) there's uh there is still some physical downside to it but there's just not any physical downside to having sex in
(52:44) moderation is that correct yeah there is but there is though there's pregnancy that can be a downside even having sex
(52:50) just one time can lead to that there's stds.com
(53:06) even if I conceded to you on the STDs it wouldn't disprove my point right now so listen very closely listen yes I can
(53:13) listen very closely how would you use it bro I just let you talk are you gonna
(53:18) let me respond or not yeah just don't just don't use things that we already has proven okay you haven't disproven
(53:23) this okay even if I conceded on the STD front even if I conceded on the STD
(53:29) front it would not disprove this so the short term the short-term ramifications of sex there are physical potential
(53:36) physical downsides that only needs to be proven true once that's it so and if you can see that it's true even once even
(53:44) once then you would have to concede on this point Alex listen well no because the consequences for almost everything
(53:50) we do in life that's right I agreement you take is going to have a positive possible negative effect it doesn't do
(53:57) it doesn't mean it's not good for you then he's a hypocrite I think I think the argument here is
(54:03) talking about anti-permanental sex okay what is the risk you said that there's zero physical ramifications for having
(54:08) sex that makes sense yeah that's insane [ __ ] insane yeah if you have a safe sex yeah moderation there's nothing okay
(54:14) so now it's a different argument so the thing is again again when you're telling you about this yes yeah what like we're
(54:20) using birth control or we're using
(54:29) condomsages from going to the girl very simple do you have it doesn't
(54:35) prevent her her pube is rubbing against yours if she has to open herpes sores does it okay Marcus Marcus is Alex's
(54:42) partner Marcus wanted to elaborate on Alex's point I think that's fair go ahead Marcus and then Richie you can
(54:47) rebutt yeah I I I think um when we say there's no negative
(54:53) effects when Alex was saying that I I think what Alex is trying to say is in the grand scheme of things in terms of
(54:58) risk of reward there really isn't that many negative effects for someone having premarital sex now yes you can make the
(55:04) argument if someone's like isn't using a condom and [ __ ] a girl and does that repeatedly and gets her pregnant that
(55:10) might be negative for him sure but I think what we're saying is most guys if they're just responsible they do this in
(55:16) a safe way then the risk is so low that I don't see it as a strong negative not
(55:21) to do it and you mentioned like open you mentioned open herpes right hsv1 is like
(55:26) 90 prevalent already and that's amongst kids not having bad that's right good
(55:32) and by the way you can get HSV without having sex
(55:39) to say that um the reason not to have sex is because the risk of HSV one or
(55:44) two again I don't think we didn't say that straw man okay what were you saying then so okay so first of all let me
(55:51) correct this because I'm looking I must be looking at completely different numbers than you Alex because what I see
(55:57) is 3.5 STD rate married in a 20 STD rate single that's what I see in a second but
(56:03) Richie you did specifically bring up Herpes what clarify what you brought up no it's
(56:09) it's fine it's what I'm saying is that if you wear a condom it doesn't prevent you from getting herpes and you're saying oh well like so here's here's the
(56:16) problem that you guys have this thing can get you hooked you're you're operating from this like this science framework right so it's like every
(56:22) problem that that science like I'll give you for instance do you think that marrying your cousin
(56:28) is a good idea and I know this is out of left field I'll bring it right back I promise do you think that marrying your cousin is a good idea
(56:34) depends on if your cousin is hot or not but generally no what is that a serious answer no
(56:41) obviously I'm kidding no it's not a good idea to marry your cousin how about you Marcus do you think marrying your cousin is a good idea uh probably not
(56:47) even having sex right probably a bad idea but even I mean the reason you shouldn't marry your cousin and the
(56:54) reason we don't encourage it is because it increases the risk of defects for the kids right so yes but but what if we
(57:03) could negate all of those defects by say using science like birth control or
(57:09) condoms is it now okay to [ __ ] your cousin are you asking me or Marcus Marcus both
(57:16) of you um I'd have to think about this honestly right you'd have to think about it you have to think about it
(57:22) if you could if you could create a world right where hypothetically there were no
(57:28) risks there was nothing wrong with [ __ ] your cousin there were no birth defects anything like that if that world existed then I'm sure we would all
(57:34) change our opinions on that what about your mom could you [ __ ] your mom bro I'm sure if we looked I'm sure if we looked
(57:40) at animals right that [ __ ] their cousins we don't think it's weird or wrong or anything like that I think if we did live in a world where there was
(57:47) Zero consequences what about your mom Marcus can you do it all right listen hang on the reason
(57:54) protective sex with your mom Marcus would that be okay
(57:59) Mom what I'm saying is if we lived in a world where there was no negative effect whatsoever then our views on sex would
(58:07) change we have that world right if you walk in the Middle East a lot of people actually set up marriages with their
(58:13) cousins it's actually
(58:19) I would say I'm against that because of the risk of the defects to the to the kids but my point is in a different
(58:25) culture in a different world in a different environment our views on what is right and wrong is going to change depending on that okay what are your
(58:33) views we're all going to have this visceral well marrying your cousin but yeah like a
(58:40) lawyer yeah but what about [ __ ] your mom correct what about [ __ ] your mom yeah we're both going to say no to that
(58:45) why why
(58:52) so if it's revolting that should be a policy prescription for people that that's the thing you Advocate against is
(58:58) whether or not it's revolting it's like should I be able to discriminate against homosexuals because I find it revolting
(59:03) you asked would we Andrew why do you why do you think it's wrong because you're very interested in it I want to hear
(59:09) your answer because I have biblical grounding from God which states that it's emphatically wrong to have shot
(59:16) with your mom you need God to tell you not to [ __ ] your mom do I need God do I need to have grounding for an argument
(59:22) yes
(59:28) very clearly yeah you literally need a religion
(59:33) no do I need to have grounding for an argument yes I do Alex isn't that insane
(59:39) religions you guys are just Fergie no let us follow up on our questions
(59:45) shut up Alex we're not done
(59:54) we're not done with our inquiry Alex stop trying to bulldoze Alex Stop spurging Alex stop before you just stop
(1:00:01) spurging Alex we're not done with our line of inquiry your office dating hours
(1:00:12) religion you're office skating I'll answer it as soon as we're done with our line of inquiry I promise so
(1:00:18) back to where we're asking for five minutes now and so of you and I asked answered all of them
(1:00:24) all right Ricky had a question about [ __ ] Cousins I get it it's very important Marcus started to answer it in
(1:00:30) a perfect world where we couldn't get up get our cousins pregnant and have defected babies then maybe we would all
(1:00:35) feel differently now Richie you said you would bring it back you promised you would bring it back baby let's go that's
(1:00:40) literally what I was bringing you back to yeah it's sexual morality like okay so if
(1:00:47) your argument is basically uh it doesn't really matter there's no negative ramifications for the man I would argue
(1:00:52) that there absolutely are negative ramifications for the women they're also the men but less so uh if we're making
(1:00:58) these women less valuable like they're there is a like like a good person undertone like whatever you can think
(1:01:04) like oh there's live free all this [ __ ] and it's like okay well how far do you really take that if you can [ __ ] your cousin and not get her pregnant can you
(1:01:10) [ __ ] your cousin you said oh well maybe in Pakistan it's a good idea well that's a [ __ ] obviously terrible idea
(1:01:16) but that's literally what Marcus said in different parts of the world that's not exactly what I said what I
(1:01:23) said is all our views might change on what is moral immoral what is correct it is what is incorrect if we lived in a
(1:01:29) completely different world where there was no consequence of [ __ ] your cousin because that's probably where it
(1:01:35) came from is defective children because a lot of people were [ __ ] their family in the past right I came from the
(1:01:40) Catholic church so I think uh I I think that that is probably the reason
(1:01:46) definitely for me that I would encourage people not to [ __ ] their family right okay so that doesn't follow Marcus
(1:01:53) why that doesn't here's why that doesn't follow I just want to finish this up and they can ask me whatever you want Alex okay okay so Marcus if that's true if
(1:02:02) all you're worried about is the negative ramifications then if you had a mom who was completely sterile and was tested to
(1:02:09) have no STD so she could not breed what would be your justification or problem with her son having sexual intercourse
(1:02:15) with her Marcus because that is the world that you're envisioning right now where you say that hey uh and these
(1:02:22) things hang on hang on if these things weren't present if these issues weren't present and in that case they're not
(1:02:27) present why would that be problematic for me no I'm not envisioning your world where one parent Couldn't Write I'm not
(1:02:33) envisioning a world where okay uh right now we we live in the exact same place but hey
(1:02:40) guess what Andrew your mom can't have a baby so go [ __ ] her right I'm saying our moral decisions come from this world
(1:02:46) that we live in so we lived in a completely different world where we'd [ __ ] people by slapping hands like this
(1:02:51) and that you you could [ __ ] family without anything you're not answering my questions about four years then maybe
(1:02:57) we'd think differently what's the problem with it from your world view I think you should have a whole standard
(1:03:03) set whether one individual kennel cannot have sex or not you have a complete uh
(1:03:09) prescription for you don't [ __ ] your family because there's risk of having taken the risk off the table can I get a
(1:03:17) question for everyone else why can't we finish our exchange and then you can get the questions
(1:03:22) okay so why is it those risks are off the table that's okay so that's why we
(1:03:28) say right drugs a lot of drugs are illegal yeah so in Australia you can't
(1:03:33) smoke weed Now in America you can if I'm in Australian I'm like look I am responsible with my weed right I can
(1:03:39) smoke weed there's no negative ramifications to me I live a happy life wheat actually helps me a little bit right that doesn't mean that I can do it
(1:03:46) and that doesn't mean that I would say that I'm allowed to do it so yeah it still doesn't it all right Bill does it
(1:03:52) not answer the question mark maybe Alex can clarify yeah I have a question that's gonna that's very
(1:03:58) related to this Andrew before you discovered religion you would have been open to [ __ ] your mom I've always been religious
(1:04:06) didn't you say that you were kind of uh you you [ __ ] a bunch of girls and then you kind of reconnected with God yeah
(1:04:12) but even then inside the framework of the religion that I had within protestantism they said no no no no no
(1:04:18) that was not appropriate so Andrew do you think you didn't have religion you would have been open to [ __ ] one mom
(1:04:23) uh well I think that there's also a secondary Factor here which is that uh
(1:04:28) there is a natural repellent inside of people when it comes to families exactly what I said but but hang on even if such
(1:04:36) a thing but even if such a thing does exist that has nothing to do with the moral justification Alex you're not sure
(1:04:42) if it exists like you're like maybe it does maybe it doesn't really and some people it doesn't and some it doesn't there's another there's another
(1:04:48) for what percentage of people do you think I'll explain I'll explain there's another phenomenon uh which was coined
(1:04:55) I'm trying to think of what the name is but it's when mothers and sons have been departed especially since birth I think
(1:05:01) it's called like sudden something attraction I don't remember what the exact terminology was but it's uh like
(1:05:06) sudden or sfd or something like this sudden family attraction and it's for family members who have been displaced
(1:05:13) for x amount of time and once they meet up again uh there's like insane sexual
(1:05:18) attraction which happens now this is rare it's not something that's a common occurrence but there are of course exceptions within the framework of those
(1:05:26) rules so if this is true and there are exceptions within the biological nature
(1:05:31) of people to create exceptions from the revolting nature that people generally feel towards family sex then we still
(1:05:37) need to have moral justifications for these or why this thing is bad which what me and Rich you're trying to get to
(1:05:42) the heart of do you think um what percentage of people do you think are repulsed by [ __ ] like their idea of
(1:05:48) [ __ ] their mom just give me the most probably most like 99.9 I don't know if it's that high but I
(1:05:55) would say most an overwhelming majority the most majority of people right so you just literally proved my earlier point
(1:06:00) which is what I was saying you might have an additional reason not to [ __ ] your mom which is that it your Bible
(1:06:06) tells you not to do it but most people are repulsed by the idea yeah that's enough motivation for them not to [ __ ]
(1:06:12) their mom you want a society just based around the
(1:06:17) social ramifications of what people find revolting Alex um I think that [ __ ] your mom is
(1:06:23) generally not a good idea because most people I think we're hardwired to find a revolting yeah okay not a good idea okay
(1:06:29) so but is it immoral to do
(1:06:34) what what moral framework are you operating are you asking any moral frame I don't care whatever moral framework
(1:06:39) you want is from your perspective is it you're immoral to [ __ ] your mom not whether or not you find it revolting
(1:06:45) yeah I would say it was it's immoral as well why we're just going to go down the tree of
(1:06:51) like WHYY deontology okay why because that's that's the set of beliefs I have and I know where you're going to go with this you're gonna ask me why why oh I
(1:06:58) have a religious framework you don't have anything by the end of the day this is a pointless argument because we can all agree that most people find the idea
(1:07:04) [ __ ] their moms and that and that you can see things that are happening today that 10 years ago would have [ __ ]
(1:07:10) disgusted people and now you have the majority of people sort of supporting it like the trans movement for instance
(1:07:16) is now popular like that's a hang on first of all it's not popular people
(1:07:22) aren't cutting off their dicks because it's popular it's a it's a premium talking point for
(1:07:28) left-wing uh uh giant politicians like everywhere like just I'm just saying disgusting [ __ ] has erupted out of
(1:07:34) nowhere what percentage of people do you think want to cut their mix off we one
(1:07:40) one in five one in five Zoomers are reporting one in five Zoomers are not reporting that they want to cut
(1:07:46) them together no I didn't say that they did I said that they're reporting that they have become lgbtq in some way shape
(1:07:53) or forms I didn't say that they were reporting that they're gonna cut their dicks off
(1:08:00) you inserted something that I didn't say Sir okay well it was it was a natural assumption since Richie was talking
(1:08:06) about cutting your dick off Alex also direct question how many people do you think want to cut their dicks off and you said Zuma's report one in five you
(1:08:13) didn't let me finish what I was saying I literally said one in five are reporting that they're lgbtq whereas just 10 years
(1:08:20) ago they were not this is revolting Behavior to most people right it's moving on going to are we going to
(1:08:25) strike the [ __ ] moms and cousins from the table is this coming back to that I'm fine with moving I'm fine
(1:08:32) Marcus I think Marcus is still thinking about the cousin to be honest
(1:08:39) I think I think it's silly to go through life to look at things very black and white I think Marcus is making Nuance uh point and what he's saying is that hey
(1:08:45) according to my beliefs and upbringing I find that to be you know bad but you know if I was born a different time in a
(1:08:52) different country I might have a different beliefs there's a reason why hundreds of years ago a lot of people were marrying their cousins again like
(1:08:58) did we become like more were we morally worse back then no it was just that fact that that was something that was
(1:09:04) commonly Done Right Moro is all universalized though Alex across different across different cultures
(1:09:10) including including sexual morality which becomes normal why did hundreds of years ago and people
(1:09:16) were more religious were they way more likely to marry their cousin then they didn't understand this first of all
(1:09:23) they weren't okay you're talking about specific Nations inside of England which had to do with crown Authority and so
(1:09:30) this was this had something to do with the genealogy going down the family some people were marrying their cousins
(1:09:36) too way higher than they are some and some and sometimes if you had small tribes things like this yes this would
(1:09:42) happen and no we didn't have the science at the time to understand what's wrong
(1:09:48) but it was very even but even then people were not going out of their way to marry except external to the tribe
(1:09:54) fact many tribes would try to intermingle with other tribes because they would see birth defects that would happen in these children and there was
(1:10:01) still by the way you have to concede this because it was your argument there was still an internalized Revolt factor
(1:10:06) which happened between people getting married in incestuous relationships or hooking up an incestuous relationships
(1:10:12) unless you think that just a few hundred years ago our biology changed so much that that wasn't present Alex but that
(1:10:19) is part of your constructed r arguments so you probably should concede that portion at least okay so I think the
(1:10:24) revolting is much stronger when it comes to the mom than the cousins I think people have a much stronger Revolt if
(1:10:30) you put a gun to a person's head and you say Hey you either have to [ __ ] your mom and [ __ ] your cousin I think 99.9 of people will take the cousin because
(1:10:35) they're less revolted by that but it seems that again people used to be more religious that's a fact and people used
(1:10:41) to marry their cousins more so it seems that more
(1:10:48) Pakistan no like everywhere like across the world fairly common show me well show me you
(1:10:54) want me pull up another study I want you to pull up something that shows that most of the world was marrying their
(1:10:59) cousins I said it was more prevalented much more prevalent than now just just stop are
(1:11:06) you disagreeing with that premise yeah so you think that people were marrying their cousins equal to or less than they
(1:11:14) are not I wouldn't be surprised if right now people have uh more incestuous relationships than they ever have in
(1:11:19) history Alex okay and that also stands to reason even if we do it per capita because there's eight billion people on
(1:11:25) planet Earth it would not actually surprise me if there was more incestuous relationships now than there ever have
(1:11:30) been on planet Earth ever especially the most recent data that I saw on this was how much incest has become prevalent as
(1:11:37) a hidden societal back door so people engaging in this activity without publicly admitting that they're doing it
(1:11:43) okay let me pull up another study for you I don't mind doing that uh space on genealogy in Pakistan it's something
(1:11:49) like 85 of households are engaging in some sort of uh incest with their
(1:11:55) cousins currently today currently and the the population of Pakistan has exploded thanks to basically the modern
(1:12:02) world that the the West has sort of provided these like new technologies populations can explode and if the if
(1:12:09) the rates are staying the same then absolutely there it stands to reason that there's more incest transforming
(1:12:14) energies I'm talking about per capita yeah I mean I feel even per capita I still think
(1:12:22) that you would probably find that incest is more prevalent now than it's ever been because polygamy is less uh less of
(1:12:29) an issue in these particular areas now because lower peasants basically have access to more resources so women are
(1:12:36) needing to go into these four five six you know women into one particular marriage so that means more children from
(1:12:43) different families which yeah I mean I I don't know like the hard numbers on it I don't know if anybody's ever actually
(1:12:48) done it like it would be hard to do a historic analysis that's true okay so I'm I'm looking at this uh sorry I
(1:12:54) didn't have my cousin [ __ ] study pulled up uh I didn't really do much research on that topic uh but I just
(1:13:00) found an article from New York Times before the real story Revolution the United States Canada and Europe you might have ended up marrying uh up to a
(1:13:06) fourth cousin people didn't travel far to find a spouse and the closer you were to a fourth cousin the more likely it
(1:13:12) was you married within your family something changed and people stopped
(1:13:17) marrying their cousins yeah so so what so they might have married their fourth cousin who they probably have no genial
(1:13:24) genealogy with right we're all cousins to each other up to some percentile every human being on planet Earth when
(1:13:31) you talk about fourth cousin I think that's so far removed it's not even problematic that's one and then the
(1:13:36) second thing is is that an article does not support whether or not and this was your argument there's more incestuous
(1:13:42) relationships now on planet Earth as opposed to previously in history that's what I want you to demonstrate
(1:13:49) are you okay with second cousin [ __ ]
(1:13:55) I think I think if you look at if you I don't I would have to look but I think if you look at fourth fifth or sixth or
(1:14:02) this type of thing uh that it's so removed from whatever your genetics are that it's actually a physical problems
(1:14:08) so you wouldn't [ __ ] your second cousin would you [ __ ] yourself scientifically scientifically it's second cousin
(1:14:14) um but it's our our form our our moral framework doesn't come down to scientifically and apparently neither it
(1:14:20) is yours because you have no I'm asking you the question you guys are cool
(1:14:25) yeah I mean anything to obfuscate from the fact that you can't actually support your previous argument Alex
(1:14:34) after industrial revolution people stopped marrying their cousins nearly as much it was not your argument whether or
(1:14:39) not they were marrying their cousins but whether there was more incest now or if there was more incest before that was your argument do you not consider
(1:14:46) [ __ ] your cousin incest of course but that has no bearing on your argument Andrew to be fair I and I know this
(1:14:52) because I wrote it down Alex specifically did refer to marrying yeah that's nice but he also States
(1:14:59) radically you stated it in fact it repeated this argument back and he said
(1:15:05) he would pull up a study to prove it what are you talking about okay let me explain this very very simply okay we
(1:15:10) agree uh marry your cousins is incest right yeah I would say so so if I just showed
(1:15:18) you a source that said that people since Industrial Revolution in America people are marrying their cousins less
(1:15:23) therefore there's less incest in the world now now no that's not a therefore
(1:15:29) that doesn't follow people marry their cousins less now that there's less incest in the world you dumb bastard
(1:15:35) okay explain to me how it doesn't follow are you saying in order to engage in incest what are
(1:15:42) you talking about dude aren't you the people that are like sort of arguing against marriage and for premarital sex
(1:15:48) what how does that have to do with anything I'm just engaging in the point the answer is bringing up because you could
(1:15:53) [ __ ] your cousin and still not get married to her yes do you think do you think that's what's happening do you
(1:15:59) think that people think that's an accurate metric of determining whether or not people are [ __ ] their cousins as to whether or not they get married to
(1:16:05) them well that's exactly the point I made interesting
(1:16:10) people are marrying their cousin Celeste therefore they're [ __ ] Cousins less do you not think those two follow or no
(1:16:16) they don't follow them in America
(1:16:24) dog marriages in America between white women and German Shepherds are extremely low does that mean that they're [ __ ]
(1:16:30) dogs if ever Source says if the sources say
(1:16:37) that since Industrial Revolution people stop marrying their cousins nearly as much then yes there's less incest by the
(1:16:43) way no no literally doesn't follow unless you can make the argument that most
(1:16:48) incest is like Mom bro that doesn't follow you can't make that you can't say the correlate that
(1:16:54) because people marry their cousins less there's less incestors doesn't make sense Andrew and Richie provide a study
(1:16:59) that supports your argument all I'm saying is he did he did provide a study that would support his would-be argument
(1:17:05) right so if you're saying that it doesn't then provide something that would be better a better resource for everyone to determine whether people are
(1:17:12) cousin [ __ ] [Laughter]
(1:17:18) years ago okay so I can I can give you this I'll give you the same exact thing you gave
(1:17:25) me which is an article from the Atlantic which is called America has an incest
(1:17:30) problem where can you show the screen well I'm not going to share the screen I'm just going to DM the the article
(1:17:35) over to you but right now I'm having I'm actually having the stats pulled up so that we can get this settled okay it's
(1:17:41) very difficult well the thing is is that I'm fine with
(1:17:46) moving on from it I just need you to acknowledge though that saying that hey
(1:17:52) because people are marrying family members less that means they're having sex with their family members less doesn't actually follow
(1:17:58) I think it falls pretty closely I think that yeah see people are marrying their cousins list what happens in marriage sex so there's less marriage there's
(1:18:05) probably less sex unless you guys are advocating that you're going to have more sex when there's no marriage
(1:18:12) are you married no I'm not married unless you're gonna are you over 100 right now I'll happily
(1:18:19) answer that question once we get through this my body count is irrelevant to this point of discussion unless Andrew you're going to make the order unless you're
(1:18:25) going to make the argument that even though there's less marriage between family members there's still a lot of
(1:18:31) hookups between family members is that your argument I think that especially now that you have uh Blended families
(1:18:38) and single motherhood yeah probably I think that the interest rates now are probably more prevalent than they ever
(1:18:43) have been uh throughout history wouldn't surprise me a bit if that was true Pakistan was also given as an example
(1:18:49) for this by the way where you're talking about such an overwhelming amount of the population we did give you data on this
(1:18:55) okay so that's one and then I haven't seen any data on it for me not only did
(1:19:01) I just I just texted you this but we brought up Pakistan that is a data point bro I'm looking at the whole world not
(1:19:07) not just Pakistan yeah but if an entire nation is almost okay let me take a look at this article
(1:19:13) are you saying that once you showed me you say that there's more insults in Pakistan in the private chat I will
(1:19:20) I don't give a [ __ ] I'm just saying like yeah if you children in private chat then okay would be great yeah which part
(1:19:27) of the article that you send me so you can say anytime where do they talk about how there's more incest nowadays
(1:19:33) Alex I gave you the same exact the same exact argument back just using an
(1:19:39) article you're I'm not claiming that there's a followence that just because America has an incest problem that that
(1:19:45) means it's more or less prevalent but your argument is that it is that it's more prevalent or less prevalent now
(1:19:50) because people marry their cousins less that incest therefore must be on the decline not only does that not logically
(1:19:55) follow but the logical structure of the argument doesn't make sense don't provide me a source that there's more incest now that's all there
(1:20:02) well you said me it doesn't prove that it talks about Andrew logical argument
(1:20:09) I just demonstrated this logically anything you haven't provided the
(1:20:15) article you send me has nothing to do with increasing incest rates can you provide me one data point that shows
(1:20:21) that instant incest is more common Alex it's your argument oh my God here
(1:20:27) we go uh here we go again we're talking about incest in the first place what was Richie's point
(1:20:32) my whole point was um that you guys don't have a uh an
(1:20:37) actual moral framework for any of this um this is
(1:20:50) whatever the realm that they're on they don't want to get into like precept and things like that Richie I'm fine with
(1:20:55) not doing that so back to this though if you're talking about the prevalence of incest right
(1:21:02) um it's been it's been it's literally been estimated to be as high as 20 percent
(1:21:07) 20 percent bro well what was it before well the thing is is we don't have good
(1:21:13) and adequate research to determine what it used to be but your argument your
(1:21:18) argument was that hang on your argument was hey because there's less marriage
(1:21:25) that I'm going to make the Bold claim that that means there's less incest that doesn't follow all right so guys I took
(1:21:33) it as Alex actually had some kind of data to provide his to like provide for
(1:21:38) his opinion right um but moving on back to topic do we want to stay on the incest thing I'm
(1:21:44) fine moving on let's move on and get let's get it back to topic back to men and women back to uh what the whole
(1:21:51) debate is about can we do the other questions hold on guys let's wash this one out I'm not going to count this as a
(1:21:57) w or an L for either side we're going to wash it okay I just I just I was kind of curious because the other proposition
(1:22:03) was uh um what was it uh no fault divorce yeah can you move
(1:22:10) into that yeah sure is everyone is everyone good to move on from this topic yeah yeah
(1:22:18) but to be fair this is good content nobody's been like ever been called out for cousin [ __ ] on YouTube that's a
(1:22:25) good one yeah it's all in good fun you know yeah anyway anyway back to so back to no fault divorce my position on it is
(1:22:31) that we should get rid of it as quickly as possible that it's detrimental to society it's been detrimental to society
(1:22:38) it's going to remain detrimental to society that you should have justifications for divorcing after all
(1:22:44) you did give your word and you did make an oath and Men ought stand by their Oaths
(1:22:50) two religious people or secular people as well I think that secularists would largely
(1:22:57) agree that they should stick by their Oaths yes no I've asked you the right question do
(1:23:02) you think that no fault divorce should not apply should also should be removed for secular people as well or just for
(1:23:09) religious people yeah I think it would be a step in the right direction for uh secularists as well though it's not my
(1:23:15) primary concern my primary concern is with the religious I still think that's from a secular standpoint it still makes
(1:23:21) a lot of sense didn't you say in the previous debate that you believe marriage should be uh mainly adjudicated
(1:23:28) by the church like the church should have Supremacy when it comes to that and the government should not have a role
(1:23:33) yeah so who's going to enforce no false divorce is going to be because it's it's a it's a legal law it's not a church
(1:23:40) doctrine right it's not the church that's causing no-fault divorce it's a law so how can the church be in charge
(1:23:47) of marriage but at the same time you want to change the law and we have to separate the two entities so if we're
(1:23:53) talking about at this point secular marriage we would say that this is a state enforcement mechanism it's
(1:24:00) let me finish the answer I just let you ask the question let me just finish the answer so if you're talking about
(1:24:06) secular marriage okay then yeah that would be state enforcement we were talking about religious marriage I'd
(1:24:12) want to see that be a church enforcement I don't see any problem with that at all and I think the state should recognize
(1:24:17) the religious marriage and the autonomy given to the church rather than the state having autonomy over that marriage
(1:24:23) I don't see why that needs to be Andrew if you get divorced who's going to enforce the alimony is it going to be
(1:24:29) the church or is it going to be the state well the true if it's a church doctrine there may not be any such things as
(1:24:35) alimony which is allowed if the state recognizes the church's authority over religious marriage who's going to allow
(1:24:40) you to divorce is going to be the church or the state who's who's going to actually put you in jail for breaking the law
(1:24:47) well from the Japan I just told you you need to separate the entities so you're
(1:24:52) asking me which and in which instance for religious marriage or for secular marriage well in both of those
(1:24:58) situations the state would come in and enforce the laws of divorce just because you're religious you don't get a
(1:25:05) different exemption underline wouldn't you why can't you well I'm not talking about why couldn't you I'm just saying
(1:25:10) that's the way it is right now yeah but I'm not talking about ish I'm talking about OT now so uh you're asking me odd
(1:25:16) questions and when I'm actually telling you what ought B what ought to be is that the state recognizes religious
(1:25:22) marriage is a separate entity where the church can enforce those marriages
(1:25:27) or secular marriage the same way they enforce it now they they're the ones who allow you to get a divorce even if the
(1:25:33) state says you have a divorce from us the church may not necessarily give you a divorce and they will literally remove
(1:25:39) you from the community if you do such a thing so the RCF penalties but let's say
(1:25:45) you're a [ __ ] you you have a kid with your wife and you become a total dick uh dead be dead and you run away what can
(1:25:51) the church do to force you to pay for the child's upkeeping so the the way that the church would generally enforce
(1:25:58) this is through excommunication and through kind of your spiritual father talking to both parties so in this case
(1:26:05) you're assuming that the marriage is between a woman in a man who both share the same religion and have turned their
(1:26:12) marriage over the enforcement arm to the actual Church itself so the church has tons and tons of authority because they
(1:26:19) can literally say you're no longer part of this church if you don't adhere to our Creed now I suppose that they could become secularists and then turn their
(1:26:25) autonomy over to the state and that would be fine they could do that but yeah there's definitely an enforcement armed there via the excommunication
(1:26:33) which is within the purview of the church they would effectively have to commit to spiritual wickedness to go
(1:26:39) totally uh um but a lot of people do that right yeah yeah unfortunately they do yeah I
(1:26:46) mean okay so okay I mean I'm not even necessarily disagreeing that much with your argument that for religious people
(1:26:52) the church what about uh at least when it comes to alimony what about child support should the church be in charge
(1:26:58) of that too or should that be okay I think that the church the church uh has often adjudicated such things using
(1:27:04) Church counselors and using Church priests where they will literally have agreements party agreements between both
(1:27:10) parties who are members of the church and say listen here's your duties and responsibilities as a Christian to your
(1:27:16) wife after we've granted you the divorce and we expect these to be upheld or else there's going to be a penalty and the
(1:27:22) penalty would be removal from that Community this is like people will kind of go over and out this is like basic
(1:27:28) this is like basic [ __ ] though like can can we maybe like uh Veer away from the Theocratic discussion here well he wants
(1:27:35) to he wants to do the inquiry that's fine
(1:27:40) in agreement about any of this well that's not the point of the biggest to come to agreements to have a
(1:27:46) discussion anyway here's the here's the issue I see is the enforcement power of the church is significantly less than
(1:27:52) the state so for example uh the state has the you know threat of bonds behind it so if you're dead with that you don't
(1:27:58) pay you don't you don't pay for your kid ultimately not right away but ultimately they can come and put you in jail right
(1:28:03) that's the threat of violence the church doesn't have that so if someone just doesn't have that but if someone just
(1:28:08) decides [ __ ] it I'd rather save thousand dollars a month on [ __ ] bills and [ __ ] than paying for my kid because I'm
(1:28:14) an [ __ ] and I'll just take I'll just join a different Church like there doesn't seem to be a very strong enforcement and they will well wait a
(1:28:20) second that would be the perfect enforcement mechanism right because once they have declared that they are now secularists they are up for secular
(1:28:27) Authority aren't they but who's going to determine whether they're religious or secular enough like
(1:28:32) how's that going to be true the people who've always determined it the church they're going to determine if
(1:28:38) you're religious or not because they're the church so you're saying that if someone doesn't follow the church rules
(1:28:44) they're declared secular and then the state comes in well they're excommunicated from the church and yeah
(1:28:49) then he would appeal to the state Authority but then the state still hasn't this is how this works right now by the way in Many Nations which are
(1:28:56) under uh uh Popple law essentially so they do uh actually allow in some of
(1:29:03) these nations and traditionally have the state to decree who is part of the church or I'm sorry the church to
(1:29:09) declare who's part of the church and who isn't and that marriage is within their Dominion if they excommunicate the
(1:29:15) person or the person walks away then yeah they become secularists and Wards of the state at that point the state
(1:29:20) enforcement uh is what's going to come in and then enforce whatever the marriage decree is but the ultimate the
(1:29:25) ultimate backing the ultimate uh enforcement mechanism is state right because the church it's almost not
(1:29:31) following the church rules the only thing the church can do is declare them to be non-religious and which board the
(1:29:37) state could come in but still the state that has the ultimate power in the situation so even if that was true which
(1:29:43) it's not but even if it was so what uh well then that doesn't follow because
(1:29:49) if a state has I mean I mean we're talking about odds then yeah I guess it's just like your philosophy I can't just prove that wrong like that ought to
(1:29:55) happen uh I just you're talking about you're talking about uh getting rid of
(1:30:00) no-fault divorce which is something that's going through the state and then your idea of enforcement is that hey the
(1:30:06) church is going to take over but then they're gonna you know if someone doesn't fall in the state is going to take back it I mean yeah that's a fine
(1:30:12) argument I don't have like a strong disagreement with that uh I don't see anything now so now that I've allowed you to have the inquiry and you're
(1:30:19) satisfied with the inquiry can we have our inquiry back now Alex I appreciate you allowing me Andrew to
(1:30:25) ask questions that was very kind of you yes you may now ask me questions as well yay well actually I had some directed
(1:30:31) towards Marcus as there's been a lot of bogarting on the debate Marcus your position on no fault divorce is it good
(1:30:37) or bad uh yeah I wouldn't say whether it's good or bad I I didn't have too strong an
(1:30:43) opinion on I think if people want to get divorced for any reason they should be able to oh for any reason
(1:30:50) yeah exactly so so what about the fact that if I if a guy wakes up one day and
(1:30:56) he thinks you know what I think I'm happy you're single I don't want to be with this girl anymore I think he can
(1:31:01) get a divorce so if a woman wakes up and says well we have four children together but I would prefer to go [ __ ] my boss
(1:31:07) and um you know go be uh go be a skank you think that there should be no penalties for her there's no fault for
(1:31:13) her whatsoever to break up her entire family in order to go do that that that's that you don't need any
(1:31:19) additional justifications for why she should be allowed to break up her entire family well if the family's broken up then
(1:31:27) obviously they're the same way it's set up now that if uh child support needs to be paid it's going to be paid
(1:31:33) um so yeah that's going to be a consequence also I think there's personal consequences for them but I wouldn't enforce a consequence as in the
(1:31:40) the wife says Okay I want a divorce I would not give any consequences just because she wanted a divorce no so do
(1:31:47) you agree or disagree that the outcomes for children in intact family homes or far superior to the outcomes of children
(1:31:53) in non-intact family homes would you agree that that's true yeah for the most part yeah yeah so if
(1:31:59) that's true then there is more than just a consequence of the individual's happiness there's an outcome on all of
(1:32:05) society if you have no show cause and you just decide that you're going to break up your intact family due to your
(1:32:12) own hedonistic preference this would actually be bad even under your world view wouldn't it
(1:32:17) yeah but there's a lot of new ones here I don't think there's a lot of marriages where the woman's just like hey you know
(1:32:23) what um I just think I want to [ __ ] my boss like everything else in this marriage is completely fine I love my husband I love
(1:32:28) my kids but you know what I just want to [ __ ] my boss so I'm going to like break up this marriage I don't know typically is what happens I think there's a lot of
(1:32:34) issues as you spoke to before right the reason people get divorce is very complicated there's a lot of issues
(1:32:40) going on the relationship which sex is one of them that we mentioned earlier um there's a lot of issues I don't think
(1:32:45) it's just uh oh I just want to and that's just it and I just want to [ __ ] my boss there's many and so I would
(1:32:51) argue that I would prefer uh there to be a especially if there's a lot of issues
(1:32:58) in that relationship I think the kids sometimes are going to be happier or have better outcomes If the parents are
(1:33:03) divorced as opposed to if they stay in an unhappy so this is this is kind of
(1:33:09) what I was waiting for you to get into as as all the dgns say the exact same thing they claim that I think they think
(1:33:16) that some of the outcomes for some of the people might be better but you just conceited moments before this that
(1:33:22) children from intact family homes have better outcomes than children without intact family homes how can you
(1:33:27) reconcile those two things for the most part yeah for the most part so we're talking about optimal again right so
(1:33:33) pointing to the outlier and saying there are some cases where divorce might be optimal it's not optimal for the most
(1:33:39) part is it if the intact family home is producing the best outcome for the children yeah so I would put a greater importance
(1:33:45) on the ability for the parents to be able to choose not to be with each other
(1:33:51) uh in situations they don't want to be in so I wouldn't force a wife to stay
(1:33:57) with their husband if they don't want to be there why if it even if it means in a greater percentage of the time the
(1:34:03) children have worse or better outcomes I think that I think that the marriage I
(1:34:09) think that the marriage uh if I would never force a woman to stay with a man
(1:34:14) first of all hang on it's not forcing the woman to
(1:34:20) stay with the man the woman and man both took an oath inside of their marriage for better for worse through richer and
(1:34:26) poorer tell death to us part Etc et cetera Etc they took oath to each other when you're talking about no fault all
(1:34:32) we're saying with no fault is that you should have to show actual cause for the divorce other than irreconcilable
(1:34:37) differences which is the number one thing cited meaning infidelity let me finish let me finish Marcus
(1:34:45) infidelity things like this that would break up the marriage from your perspective though it's okay if right
(1:34:51) right now if you're looking at society and why Society is so messed up it's due to a single motherhood epidemic which is
(1:34:57) on the rise and this is why you see so many people having such bad outcomes in
(1:35:02) life homelessness rates are tied to single motherhood poverty is tied to single motherhood almost every single
(1:35:07) instance of negative outcomes that you can find currently in society back to single motherhood you don't give a [ __ ]
(1:35:14) about any of those outcomes just the hedonistic relationships
(1:35:19) Alex had a follow-up to Marcus's and then we'll move to you rich yeah Alex just had his inquiry can me and Marcus
(1:35:26) finish our experience it's directly rain could Andrew could you provide proof that children of couples who hate each other are happier than the Children of
(1:35:32) Divorce couples what would that matter about the outcomes well because if it turns out that children uh when the
(1:35:39) parents hate each other uh have worse outcomes than the children of uh couples who get divorced that now completely
(1:35:45) destroy your home there is some there is here there is some good evidence to this and I'll give you a good example of this
(1:35:51) uh if you look if you look at the children who are remanded to State
(1:35:56) custody okay they are one thousand times in some some cases I've seen is between
(1:36:02) 100 and a thousand some it's only as high as 50 but it's a significant amount more uh that they will actually be
(1:36:09) abused even if they come from an abusive home the abuse will actually be worse what does that have to do with anything
(1:36:15) because what it's demonstrating is that if you're looking at the outcomes base here even then if you have an intact
(1:36:22) family in an abusive home it still seems to be optimal than when you remove even the abusive parents so that does seem to
(1:36:29) lend some sort of evidence to the fact that even if the parents don't get along or even if you're in an abusive
(1:36:34) household with intact parents that it might be optimal to the alternative you're making massive logical leap here
(1:36:40) I'm talking specifically about unmarried uh couples who got divorced right versus
(1:36:46) couples we hate each other and stay together I'm not even I don't even have a strong position on this I'm just wondering whether your premise is even
(1:36:51) true is it like can you provide any proof that the couples who stay together
(1:36:57) and hate each other have the kids have better outcomes than the couples who get divorced there's literally no way to find that
(1:37:03) out because hate is a subjective terminology right
(1:37:10) who cares let's just concede it hang on hang on let's just concede it right what does I have to do with my argument that
(1:37:16) the outcomes for children who are from intact homes are far better and Far and Away better than the outcomes of
(1:37:23) children who are the product of single mothers what would you even if I gave you that argument can you explain to me
(1:37:30) in some way how it negates mine no I I agree with that children on average children from uh intact homes will have
(1:37:36) better outcomes than children single mothers I think then what are we arguing no one's going to disagree with that
(1:37:42) well because we're talking about no-fault divorce right so we're talking about the idea of whether a couple
(1:37:48) getting divorces negatively going to impact the children so we have to do is look at couples who want to get divorced
(1:37:53) and don't and the outcomes of those children versus the couples who actually do get divorced why
(1:37:58) because if it turns out that the couples who stay together uh and don't like each other children have worse outcomes than
(1:38:05) than no-fault divorce would probably be a good thing okay so the epidemic of shingle
(1:38:12) motherhood which has spawned almost in line with no fault divorce are you
(1:38:17) saying so you're saying it on both sides of your mouth on the one hand you say yes if the if there's an in-tax family
(1:38:22) unit that's optimal for the children buy all of your data that you're looking at but your counter argument to this is
(1:38:29) that there could be some cases where the parents are you know uh in a
(1:38:34) relationship where they hate each other's guts and that could disproportionately affect the outcome of the children well your answer's already
(1:38:40) there which is if that's true then we should still see that the intact homes
(1:38:46) you're going to have X amount of parents who don't like each other or hate each other or stay together for the kids the outcomes there still seem to be optimal
(1:38:53) in comparison to the single motherhoods by the stats but why does it have to be single mothers like they're you're
(1:38:59) you're what else are you going to be if you're divorced well you can have a modern a mother and father who both take
(1:39:05) care of the kid they do separately whether they the kid family home right so that's what I'm
(1:39:11) looking at so if we're looking at single mothers sure I will grant you that those will have worse outcomes but they're still considered single mothers
(1:39:18) um we're both we're both of the parents are there for the kid they're just not
(1:39:24) married anymore that's what that's what I'm asking others bro it's it's literally and hang
(1:39:30) on hang on 2012 89 of kids in the psych ward do not have intact families if they
(1:39:35) come from fatherless home ninety percent of homeless kids have single mom 85 percent of behavioral disorders single
(1:39:41) mom 70 percent of kids in juvenile hall single months I agree with you that single mom that oh my God yeah
(1:39:49) right and it would follow Alex and Marcus too then it would follow that
(1:39:55) even if there were intact homes where the parents stayed together even though they hated each other's guts the outcomes for the kids would still be
(1:40:01) better because the outcomes for kids are still better from in tax homes period so it follows do you do you think like the
(1:40:08) only two options are either your single like only the mother's raising the kid and you're intact like do you not think
(1:40:14) there could be a lot of situations where the mother and father both take care of the kid
(1:40:32) do you think most of the time when people get divorced only the mothers there for the kid and the father just
(1:40:37) like most of the time in divorces women get full custody of the children and including primary custody only just now
(1:40:43) in the last 10 years has joint custody and joint physical custody even become even slightly egalitarian but yes for
(1:40:51) the most part the women always get the kids Alex
(1:41:08) how many of those are the father involved right how many of those is I
(1:41:13) understand the distinction but you don't understand that that would still be considered a single mom household versus
(1:41:19) an intact family so it's around you not grasping this so if the father has partial custody that would still be
(1:41:25) considered a single mother home yes yes of course why wouldn't it be if the
(1:41:31) father has joint custody that would still be considered oh she's single she's a single mother
(1:41:37) whether the father has some access to his children the mommy is still single okay
(1:41:44) one week with Mom and one week with that would that still be a single mother home yes
(1:41:49) holy [ __ ] so if we took all these single mothers right wait wait no no I need you to concede that yes that would be a
(1:41:55) single mother hole that's still a single mom in a home who's single all right I've never defied I've never defined a
(1:42:01) single mother as I've defined single mothers I've never been a statistician that works in sociology
(1:42:07) I think most people view single mothers when the mom is the only one racing the kid and that isn't there for the kid I
(1:42:13) don't I don't view the situation hang on relax I don't view a situation where both the mom and dad are there for the
(1:42:19) kid the kid is spending some time with moms sometime with Dad as a single mother home and I think most people don't view that as a single what would
(1:42:26) an intact family home be what would that hang on what would that mean to both of you guys what is intact home mean all of
(1:42:33) the moderate speak all right I was saying it was Marcus had a point to elaborate on that but if I was gonna ask
(1:42:39) you a different question if they want to finish this yeah what is intact single home mean to you guys what does that mean intact family home intact what does
(1:42:46) that mean or the mother and father are living together with the kid so if Mommy and Daddy are not living together with
(1:42:52) the kids and they're living separate even though both of them may have input on the kids lives would that be a single mom or an intact family home Alex
(1:42:59) there's more than two options my man but to give me the third the third option is the the kids spend some time with Mama
(1:43:06) sometime with Dad yeah was that still qualify as a single mother or an intact family home Alex
(1:43:11) yeah there's there's more than two options yeah so the third and so I just asked you on the third option which
(1:43:17) would that fall under as a category do you think Andrew are you a homosexual are you a alcoholic pick one of those
(1:43:24) too I mean either of those sayings it's a presuppositional pre-loaded question so there we go so yes I asked you what
(1:43:30) the third category was three times there is no way there is no way to
(1:43:37) distinguish between uh uh how many you know how many days the father gets what
(1:43:42) the quality of the father is there is no way to to statistically analyze on a mass scale what are the outcomes for uh
(1:43:50) you know four children with the husband who makes this amount of money versus like you could just infinitely regress
(1:43:55) into like all these little different distinctions to where it's an impossibility to gather the data which is the reason that they gather the data
(1:44:01) between two separate entities which is single or together yeah that's it it's
(1:44:07) an intact or it's not intact it can't be no it can't be both no one okay I understand no one is disagreeing with
(1:44:12) you that single mothers uh homes are going to have worse outcomes than intact families what I'm talking about is a
(1:44:18) third category and I'm posing a question does that third category where the parents have joint custody of the kid
(1:44:23) the kid spends time with Mom and Dad's outcomes yes they do that's that's
(1:44:29) considered under the sociological standard to be a non-intact home so you had an intact home it's going to be mom and dad in the same home with the kids
(1:44:35) that's an intact family home everything outside of that is not an intact family so the two options just so I understand
(1:44:41) this are single mother homes and intact family homes there's no third option right that well that's how you're going
(1:44:46) to be categorizing this you could make subcategories under this for the purpose of extrapolating additional data so you
(1:44:53) could say what about homes with a stepfather or what about homes without a stepfather and they do do that and you
(1:44:58) can extrapolate uh you know data off of that as well but for the purpose of this conversation it's either an intact home
(1:45:05) or a non-intact home and in the intact homes the kids do way better than in the the non-intact homes yeah should assume
(1:45:12) that the intact homes are having better outcomes probably because the parents don't [ __ ] hate each other right The
(1:45:17) Single Moms what we need what we really need to look at is if we take all these let me finish for a second if we take
(1:45:23) all the single moms that are divorced hate their [ __ ] partner miserable and have divorced and then force them to be
(1:45:30) staying together how do the kids cope then what do they look like they still right now we have intact family homes we
(1:45:36) already assume are going to be more happy together and then we have people that are divorced probably because there's a lot of [ __ ] going on right but
(1:45:42) what we really need to look at is if you take all these single mums with all this [ __ ] going on that hate their partner it's awesome to be together they're kids
(1:45:49) still going to be as high okay but we've already answered this it's actually loaded in to the data itself so if you
(1:45:56) were to see that most of these married couples dislike each other or hate each other or things like this even
(1:46:02) pre-default or no fault divorce where most marriages stayed intact okay most
(1:46:08) of them did pre uh no fault divorce so knowing that this is true if you look at
(1:46:14) the intact family homes even if those parents and there must have been plenty of them who hated each other the
(1:46:19) outcomes for the children were still better but you don't know it's a correlation
(1:46:26) it's not a causation thing it could be multiple things that are causing kids to be worse off nowadays than they were 30
(1:46:32) years ago yeah just all of them go back to the single mom I just read the stats it's more than a correlatory when all of
(1:46:38) the stats again 89 psych ward do not have intact families and fatherless
(1:46:43) homes ninety percent of the of the homeless children are from a fatherless home 85 percent of kids with behavioral
(1:46:49) disorders fatherless home seventy percent of the kids are arguing they're less home children
(1:47:06) go ahead it's not a virtue signal this is literally happening in reality okay
(1:47:13) your children are 40 times more likely to be molested or abused by somebody
(1:47:20) outside of the home 40 times that's a magnitude of 40. do you understand what that means that was a fantastic argument
(1:47:27) to a point that no one is it is obviously a bad thing
(1:47:32) this is directly related to no fault divorce if it's on a whims
(1:47:38) we're getting 40 times do you have a counter argument or not I feel like I'm just debating chat you guys just keep
(1:47:44) repeating yourself well your nose is [ __ ] up so great like uh
(1:47:50) like let's listen to the mod for just a second Richie bring that back to the actual subject I know I know what you're
(1:47:56) saying and maybe a lot of people can I repeat can I repeat Alex's argument I repeat Alex's argument so we know we're
(1:48:02) on the same page let Richie cook for a second and then sure go ahead Richie let it out what I'm saying is that you're
(1:48:08) sort of hand waving this away and it's like oh well there could be these Exceptions there could be these this is how this is this is how this is
(1:48:14) statistically broken down because there are either intact homes or non-intact types Dad could be a rapist sure it's
(1:48:21) happened 40 times more likely for the children miners to be sexually or
(1:48:26) physically abused 40 times more likely in single mother households and this
(1:48:32) includes all this includes all of the data with the dad that has you know half custody because guess what and then this
(1:48:38) is like this like will logically follow you don't even have to look at the data right if I'm a pedophile and I want to
(1:48:43) find kids that are easy easy access to right where do I go
(1:48:51) I go to a single mom that has a full-time job yeah you'd go where the kids were so that's why it logically
(1:48:57) follows same same way that you see yourself yeah well it's the same reason that hyper Predators you find them in
(1:49:03) schools and you find them in churches and you find them in places where there's easy access to kids you're still not engaging with me let me repeat your
(1:49:10) argument and you tell me if I got it right I just want you to engage with what Marcus is saying I want to engage with both of you are saying but let me
(1:49:16) make sure that I get it right by repeating it first so you know I'm not straw Manning you your argument is that
(1:49:22) inside of intact family homes can we demonstrate that the children from homes
(1:49:29) of married couples who argue and fight and have a bad relationship are still Superior to uh homes of people who are
(1:49:37) divorced am I incorrect in this no you're correct you actually saw okay so then we have answered this 13 times
(1:49:44) and told you that the data itself for intact family homes if we go back pre
(1:49:51) um uh no fault divorce if we go back pre no fault divorce where divorce was not a
(1:49:56) thing for the most part you would expect the outcomes for those children because many of the parents must have hated each
(1:50:03) other to have been worse but they're not right but at another day we just don't
(1:50:10) know whether the dude antidepressants drug users on the rise we don't know
(1:50:17) you're making correlative argument which is fine but we don't know if it's because of no-fault divorce that kids
(1:50:22) are having worse outcomes that's the thing so in order to prove that we would need to isolate for the factors and look
(1:50:28) at kind of the way Margaret said we would have to look at let's find out if that's if that holds if that holds water
(1:50:33) let's find out why do you think it is that people were not getting divorced at the same rate they are now pre no fault
(1:50:41) divorce Alex what would you say the reason for that is if you had to like guess
(1:50:46) I think there's multiple reasons I think that give me one well let me give you multiple there was the religion I think
(1:50:52) social um uh pressure was another one and yeah I think the law played the role sure so I think it's a no-fault divorce at least
(1:50:58) played do you think that no fault divorce played a significant role in the uptick in divorces considering that
(1:51:04) after no fault divorce became a thing divorce rates skyrocketed would you say that's a very strong correlatory Alex in
(1:51:11) what period what's the period that we're looking at Point a correlatory yeah I'm just saying
(1:51:18) we're talking about like a year after the fall divorce so we're talking about like in 20 years
(1:51:25) oh over over even the course of let's say let's just give it like the widest birth we can and say over a 50-year time
(1:51:31) span wouldn't you say that that's a strong correlate if you see the massive
(1:51:37) increase in divorce go uh right alongside with this law being passed and
(1:51:43) people their number one answer for why they're getting divorced is irreconcilable differences meaning they
(1:51:48) don't have to show cause anymore you don't think that that's a strong correlate really I think this is
(1:51:54) correlate yeah is it a strong correlation I think whether it's strong or not depends on the times span and on
(1:51:59) the increase if we're talking like 400 percent then yeah it's a strong correlate if it's like 20 over the span
(1:52:05) of 50 years in this nostril correlate so it's hundreds of percent higher hundreds of percent now if you go back before now
(1:52:12) hang on let me ask you this if you go back before no fault divorce and you take a look at all of these intact marriages wouldn't it stand to reason
(1:52:19) that if there was this kind of rampant abuse which you guys are claiming happens within marriages which is bad
(1:52:25) for kids which is why we need no fault why is it that you didn't see the worst outcomes for the kids when people were
(1:52:31) basically staying married within the confines of their vow can you explain that to me yeah sure there could be multiple reasons it could be the fact
(1:52:37) that okay well I'm just about to it could be the fact that we didn't really uh you know focus on children as much
(1:52:43) like in terms of the government investigating there was less ways to report abuses that we didn't track the
(1:52:48) status it could it could be that for example uh you know uh technology has [ __ ] kids up
(1:52:55) as other things that are causing kids to get [ __ ] up other than the fact that their parents got divorced okay so
(1:53:01) that's why that's why the time span matter let's take these one at a time let's start with the first one the first
(1:53:07) one is that the government has not been researching it enough and that's the problem okay that makes no sense because
(1:53:13) we have the outcomes because we have the outcomes of the people who came before and we know that they were saying that
(1:53:19) child services wasn't as present Alex just restate Verbatim what you said because Andrew that wasn't verbatim but
(1:53:26) when it comes to the government researching what was your point the point I was making is that government
(1:53:31) agencies like child services for example did not have the popularity they have now and there was less ways for kids uh
(1:53:39) to report abuse or report negative outcomes that's one possible wait a minute
(1:53:45) yeah and so we're taking one at a time what do you mean report negative outcomes we can just see the outcomes
(1:53:50) they don't have to report it we can see the graduation rates we can see their literacy rates we can see their job in
(1:53:56) employment rates we can see the lack of homelessness rates we can see the lack of anti-social drugs that they were on
(1:54:01) we can see all of those things we don't need their [ __ ] reporting okay I misunderstood you I thought you were
(1:54:06) talking about happiness okay if we're going off those factors then it will come down to any number of things that happened in the last 30 years could be
(1:54:13) pornography it's probably playing a role probably technology probably a lack of uh you know um communities probably a
(1:54:19) lack of purpose I mean there's so many things they're playing a role and why kids nowadays are having worse outcomes there's a correlation there but I don't
(1:54:26) know if there's a causation there there's no okay so again if it's just a
(1:54:31) correlate and not a causation and you are making the affirmative claim that it must have something to do with things
(1:54:38) outside of this as at least some strong correlate well okay so it's the strongest correlate the no-fault
(1:54:43) divorcer isn't it
(1:54:50) wise because of no fault like how much has it gone up would you say Andrew it's just it's a significant increase
(1:54:58) I'm going to have the chart pulled in just a second so I'll give you the the actual data on this so that you can see
(1:55:04) the significant increase in divorce but 1870. no no not just not just increasing
(1:55:09) divorce I'm saying do you have any statistics on specifically isolated for
(1:55:15) no fault that's what I was curious of well what do you mean isolated for no fault well I I just don't want to see
(1:55:21) that divorces have gone up in x amount of time I want to see
(1:55:26) how much divorce is going up be closer to unfold okay so so hang on so hang on
(1:55:31) so hang on again if that's what you wanted if that's what you want to see Marcus I think that that's I think that
(1:55:37) that's fair so let's see if we can uh walk through this are you ready
(1:55:43) would you say that no fault divorce is a strong correlate for the increase in divorce or not
(1:55:49) well I don't have the daughter on that I'm not sure okay to be honest with you okay well so here I'll pull the studies
(1:55:55) while you guys engage and we'll Circle back to this but I am going to circle back to this I guess just generally
(1:56:00) speaking how could you how could you not see that that's a correlate like if if women are in it we
(1:56:08) all agree it's a correlate well okay okay well he Marcus just said he didn't agree he did he needed no no I said no
(1:56:14) no I said agree I just don't know about how much that's what I'm asking yeah oh okay okay one percent right let's say it
(1:56:20) increases by one percent okay so I have over one dozen studies one dozen studies I'm gonna text them to Alex right now
(1:56:28) so it doesn't the Dozen studies and stats proving the broken homes are causal do not correlated to poor
(1:56:34) outcomes in kids right I'm Gonna State what these studies say and then you guys live can go through these studies and
(1:56:41) let's watch and see but yes it's not just a correlate can you say the study or post I'm sending I'm texting them to
(1:56:47) you right now and the private chat whoever chat
(1:56:55) my my brain hurts about this [ __ ] but are you guys seriously are you seriously
(1:57:01) like the the prospect of going through these studies and you guys like nitpicking them and [ __ ] ah but
(1:57:06) actually my mom was pretty cool and uh looking at study is important Richie well okay fair enough go for it
(1:57:14) um but can't you like just just think about it logically right if if women who
(1:57:20) you know well right because you're pickup artists right like you you understand how women function you know understand how they think right what
(1:57:26) else would you find them to be particularly accountable when they do something wrong
(1:57:33) depends on the woman some yes or no of course generally speaking I would not say gender Wise Women yeah
(1:57:45) is that like part of your plan to get laid why you ask that question no that's right do you think women don't take
(1:57:50) responsibility compared to men do you think is possible well far more often than women do
(1:57:56) generally speaking but of course yeah what are you basing that on I don't know where are you getting that from
(1:58:02) hatred Marcus okay I've seen so many men not take responsibility for their laws that's
(1:58:08) insane so I don't know well fair enough but Society doesn't sort of reward those men for not taking responsibility they
(1:58:15) don't get sympathy like if somebody if you have a buddy that's [ __ ] up at work and he [ __ ] up big time like big
(1:58:22) time like fireable offense and he gets fired you're like you feel bad for him but it's like hey you [ __ ] up man but
(1:58:27) if a woman does it and she comes to you crying it's like a different emotional response women get away with [ __ ] like
(1:58:32) that far more often than men do uh okay so what so are you trying to
(1:58:38) make the argument that women are take responsibility less than men is that is that the point you're gonna make I'm
(1:58:43) trying trying to appeal to your general understanding of just your interactions with women right like this is like what
(1:58:49) you guys do right like this is your puas so you're asking experience yeah yeah
(1:58:57) like I'm sorry but my answer isn't going to change I think I've seen both countless men and countless women not take responsibility and vice versa I
(1:59:03) don't know which one uh my position on this is agnostic I don't know which one takes responsibility less I would say
(1:59:08) it's probably pretty close I would say probably the similar percentages of men and women not taking responsibility but
(1:59:14) if you have some kind of source or something like that sure yeah hang on hang on I've sent you I've now sent you tons I've texted you tons if you can put
(1:59:22) them in the private chat I can't do that because just the the way that I'm streaming but I sent you tons and tons
(1:59:28) of sources now over the top amounts showing not only the rampant rates of
(1:59:33) abuse but the ties in to no fault divorce you can even see the phenomenon in the UK it's tied in for the no fault
(1:59:39) divorces like I can't make it any clearer at how how much the tie-in is to
(1:59:46) no fault divorces here's another one okay can I take a look at it or go ahead take your time yeah so guys let's table
(1:59:53) no fault divorce and move on to another topic of Interest what was another point of contention did we have
(2:00:01) we were talking many things well those were the those were the two tops I'm happy to move on into while we do that
(2:00:07) we'll Circle back to it yeah so I'm happy I am happy to move on if you guys want to into another topic it doesn't
(2:00:13) matter to me but there's plenty of data which Associates this with no fault divorce and our opponents by the way
(2:00:19) their only counter argument was what can you know let's go back to downside of sex
(2:00:54) um so uh Alex made a claim that married men versus single men have the same STD
(2:00:59) rates Andrew I saw you looked at that study and you I heard you earlier in my incorrectance where I I heard you say
(2:01:06) that that was not correct you read that you don't agree that the study shows that it reflects that
(2:01:13) well the the not at the data that I'm looking at which I also sent that over to Alex so if you're if you're talking
(2:01:19) about the data that I see shows that the STD rate in married men is only 3.5
(2:01:24) percent uh and then 20 in the unmarried
(2:01:29) men now of course if this depends on how you want to divide up the data you know what I mean it always depends on how do
(2:01:36) you want to divide up the data I'll resend it to you in just a second but this is what I'm seeing I'm seeing completely different rates than what
(2:01:43) he's saying and by the way that actually follows why wouldn't it follow that people especially people who are in
(2:01:49) intact marriages their rates significantly decrease whereas people who engage in multiple sex partners
(2:01:55) their risk significantly increases so the thing is the reason why homosexuals
(2:02:00) have a higher rate of HIV no one cares about homosexuals I'll explain one more
(2:02:06) time explain it initially they're having sex with more people okay I understand that gay people have a lot of sex uh
(2:02:12) because when you're married you generally don't use condoms with your wife right because there's an element of
(2:02:17) trust and I think we can all agree there's a lot of cheating that happens so even though they have less total
(2:02:23) seconds hang on hang on because they're not using protection right that's what
(2:02:30) counterbalances the risk so yes people who are living this is a totally Wild Thing game which is just just relax you
(2:02:36) uh people people who are single do probably have more sex than married people have more Partners but they're
(2:02:42) typically more likely to use condoms since this condoms are 99.9 effective whatever 99 Point whatever five percent
(2:02:47) effective if used properly that is the reason for that that's what the author says that's not what I said that's what
(2:02:52) the author says actually text me your study on my opinion is on this even if I
(2:02:58) study is high rates among single people I don't think that's a reason not to
(2:03:05) have pre-marital sex I I think it's a very small risk that you might get an STI especially if you're being careful
(2:03:10) about it but that wouldn't be a reason for me to tell someone not to have pre-marital sex well it's not just that
(2:03:16) that's true there'd be a risk of there's a risk of pregnancy which is another that's another Factor not only is there
(2:03:22) a risk of pregnancy but then you can move into the way that you have evaluated women so it would logically
(2:03:29) follow that if you're making the claim that if a woman has x amount on a body count raise a red flag with you then how
(2:03:35) can you explain that except to say that every single time a woman has sex with a man it devalues her as far as men are
(2:03:43) concerned right to a certain point if you if the woman has a 400 lay kind of course if she's got a five-lay count I
(2:03:48) don't consider that devalued at all I you know me personally I think a lot of men would actually prefer a girl that
(2:03:54) has some experience right sure not 300 that's it primary but someone's been with three guys four guys I think that's
(2:04:01) a problem and I would consider the girls that I actually sleep with and I slept with before I would never consider them
(2:04:07) devalued even if we're making the argument that a highly count is going to devalue them because your highest
(2:04:13) priority that's because your highest priority is the sexual pleasure that you're receiving nothing about me or
(2:04:19) Marcus at all you're just purely talking out of your ass this goes back to the point I was making earlier you're talking about when you
(2:04:25) say uh you know uh devours the woman you're talking about social repercussions what else could it be except pleasure okay socials when I have
(2:04:32) sex with someone you're sharing a very intimate experience you're both being incredibly pleasurable a pleasurable
(2:04:38) experience of course it's pleasure yeah so what else is it so when he says that you're hedonist you're just focusing on
(2:04:43) Pleasure why is it wrong your main goal is fun you keep doing the [ __ ] where you like getting married he's pleasurable isn't it I keep doing this
(2:04:49) you can do the [ __ ] where you purposely you need to learn logic that's what your problem answer my questions stop
(2:04:56) obfuscating every five seconds you did she didn't say uh Richie said it's his only goal he didn't say it's one of his
(2:05:02) goals I said it's a primary goal right where's primary is different than only okay no
(2:05:10) pleasure if it was just pleasure I just get prostitutes and tell me what else it is tell me what else it is I just I just
(2:05:16) told you you get to build a connection with the goal right is that pleasurable or not pleasurable
(2:05:21) all of this is going to be pleasurable you can right so then it's all pleasure pleasurable
(2:05:26) everything is pleasure yes yeah I mean you could either essentially right anything the policy was going to be
(2:05:31) everything is not pleasurable having people people who are changing but wait so you're saying that people who are
(2:05:37) chased and not engaging in sex even though they want to that's pleasurable for them are you saying that people who are
(2:05:44) chased and would like to have sex but do not because they feel like it's a duty not to do so that that's pleasurable to
(2:05:50) them yeah it probably is why why would that be pleasurable they want to do they want
(2:05:56) to do a thing but they can't do the thing why would that be pleasurable yeah
(2:06:02) why won't you let this guy answer a [ __ ] question well I just want you to get answers what is different I've been
(2:06:07) answering them non-stop different types of pleasure so when I withhold from eating a Big Mac I actually find that
(2:06:13) pleasurable because I'm meeting my die calls for example if you're someone that really believes that sex is bad and you're withholding yourself from doing
(2:06:19) it you probably feel a sense of pleasure from doing that with myself just because I'm having sex doesn't mean it's just
(2:06:25) for pleasure physically tactically there's a lot more that goes on with sex it's a very intimate experience it's very vulnerable that you share with a
(2:06:31) person there's a lot more that goes into that when I lay down with a girl after having incredible sex with her and we're
(2:06:37) cuddling and staring into each other's eyes yes it's pleasurable but it's more than just oh I'm [ __ ] this girl because I just want to get my dick hard
(2:06:43) right so so then from your world view as Richie just stated the purview of
(2:06:49) consequentialism for you is everything is under a pleasure Dynamic so you believe that if you abstain from
(2:06:55) something it's pleasurable if you don't abstain from something that's pleasurable but it's all based around your pleasure no I'm not I'm not saying
(2:07:02) that at all then give me something that's not based around pleasure okay then we can go back to sexual
(2:07:07) compatibility I might just be having sex with this girl I'm not saying just this is a part of it to figure out if this is
(2:07:14) someone I actually want to spend more time with because if this is going to be awful and we don't match and it's awkward and it doesn't feel right then I
(2:07:20) don't want to spend any more time with this go on a relationship yeah because it's not but it's not as pleasure it's not compatible it's the same way if you
(2:07:27) were to meet someone right and you go on a date and this goal is just a [ __ ] [ __ ] you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] brain dude
(2:07:33) it's not going to be pleasurable it's not going to be pleasurable I agree it's all based around pleasure yeah
(2:07:40) Richie an exorcist oh we operate around Christian deontology not around pleasure and
(2:07:46) consequentialism is having sex with your wife pleasurable Andrew are you going to answer that of course okay
(2:07:51) um that's a pleasure yeah there can be there can be hang on there is
(2:07:58) intersection for having a pleasant conversation
(2:08:04) there is intersection between there is intersection here between different
(2:08:10) ethical standards so I'm not saying that all pleasure is bad that's ridiculous I'm just asking you for a mode or a
(2:08:17) model that you operate off of that's not purely based around Pleasures in your brain because I think that that's the
(2:08:22) odd the mod the modus operandi for you just like it is for Alex I think both of you base everything around whatever
(2:08:30) Pleasures you're getting out of it and you don't really give a [ __ ] ultimately but I what I was going to say is
(2:08:36) if I ever need a therapist I'm definitely going to hit you up I think it's my pleasure I'm sorry yeah
(2:08:43) sorry Ashley yeah if I faulted my pleasure right sales having every time I had sex with someone it killed them
(2:08:49) right then all these honestly I wouldn't want to be having sex with them okay so to just say it's just pleasure it's
(2:08:56) obviously not true that that actually doesn't even make sense what are you talking about
(2:09:01) if I enjoyed [ __ ] a goal but I mean she died afterwards because I had a deadly dick right yeah so then but then
(2:09:09) under your world view you just got done telling me that you would do that action because you find it the most pleasurable for you
(2:09:16) oh no hang on I will give you the accounts
(2:09:23) shut up Alex let us finish our exchange one more one more time Marcus Marcus
(2:09:32) we're going to be completely quiet we're going to be me and Richie will be completely quiet and then you ask the
(2:09:38) question again and let me answer it okay so then if you don't have a
(2:09:45) question let me finish I'm just asking you so here's and I'm trying Alex stop talking so one more time you're
(2:09:51) previously I asked you this I said if a person has a duty to not have sex and
(2:09:58) abstain from sex even though they want to have sex would you consider that to be pleasure you said yes so under this
(2:10:03) same exactly it would be pleasurable for someone to withstain from something they don't want to do no your exact words were yes
(2:10:14) maybe I really want a Big Mac and I don't have it and it's [ __ ] miserable or maybe it feels really good because
(2:10:20) I'm staying with my diet plan it could be both is what I was saying yeah so under your world view then if a person
(2:10:26) has feels like they have a duty to abstain or be chased that doesn't necessarily mean that that's the most
(2:10:33) pleasurable thing for them then correct yeah correct okay great so now so now
(2:10:39) that we have that answer and we're moving back into years why would you want to have promiscuous sex with
(2:10:44) multiple women external to pleasure what is the duty there I don't see it I'm not
(2:10:49) encouraging everyone to have promiscuous sex I'm talking about you specifically all I'm saying is you shouldn't stop
(2:10:56) people from doing it right yeah okay but I'm asking you a direct question and the direct question is can you tell me what
(2:11:03) it is for you which is external to pleasure for why you do that
(2:11:09) why have sex external to pleasure I just said I get to build a connection with a girl I get to be vulnerable with her I
(2:11:16) get to understand if we're compatible I can understand if this relationship I want to move forward can't you do all those things without
(2:11:22) having sex with them not to the same level yeah I probably could but not to the same level so the
(2:11:30) pleasure aspect should be the deciding tipping factor for you yeah not the deciding tipping Factor no well
(2:11:37) then why can't you do engage all of those activities that's a large part of sex okay no one is denying that everyone
(2:11:44) who I hope I hope everyone's having great sex and enjoying it but that's not the only reason I do it as I mentioned
(2:11:50) once again there are many other reasons to it what if all of those but you can do all of those things without having
(2:11:56) sex what if I meet two goals right if I make
(2:12:02) true goals and one I don't have sex with them one I do I can guarantee you I will understand if we're compatible is a
(2:12:08) relationship a lot quicker with a girl I'm having sex with why because it's a shared very intimate
(2:12:13) experience right so it I would argue it's almost the same as if I was to go on a holiday with one of the goals as
(2:12:19) opposed to the other right so the most important aspect for you so then the most important aspective which is a huge
(2:12:26) part of a relationship so then the most important part for you actually is the sex which is what I stated before and
(2:12:31) you disagreed with no I didn't say when did I ever say it's the most important so it will help you
(2:12:37) well it has to be the most important because you say these other factors are are not even you said these other
(2:12:44) factors can't really you can't really determine them without the sexual aspect right
(2:12:50) and understand that much better if you do have sex with them okay I didn't say it's 100 okay
(2:13:02) Andrew why do you smoke and drink besides pleasure because I like it pleasure yeah so all right it seems like
(2:13:10) pleasure is a huge motivator in your life as well it's a motivator for me to smoke and drink what does it have to do with price T in
(2:13:16) China was it pleasurable getting married to your wife of course Marcus Marcus hold on hold on Marcus yeah
(2:13:30) I want to know it's fine I'm willing to answer any questions or like whatever
(2:13:36) okay okay but but um okay so Marcus if let's imagine a scenario where you had
(2:13:42) this girl that was great in every aspect right um but you didn't have sex with her yet
(2:13:49) would you marry her not knowing that you would have like knowing that you didn't really know how she was in bed
(2:13:55) no way Mario then the most important part of your relationship I would say is
(2:14:02) I would say that let me answer this I would say that about plenty of other categories if she was good in every
(2:14:08) single way but she never wanted to have kids then I probably wouldn't marry her now is that going to be the most
(2:14:14) important thing no it's just one deal breaker bad sex is one deal breaker no kids is one deal breaker not wanting to travel is another deal breaker
(2:14:23) she's the perfect woman but what's that a deal is that a deal breaker
(2:14:28) and she [ __ ] crashes her car yeah so this is every other time she's perfect
(2:14:33) yeah hang on hang on for me
(2:14:39) explain how it's a pivot so we're asking Marcus about Marcus specifically and Marcus moves on to a generalization and
(2:14:45) says well it could be for some people this is a deal for you it's a woman who won't have
(2:14:52) children a deal breaker for you to get married how to make I know the exact one you're
(2:14:59) gonna try to make your dude at every debate super boring like oh but Marcus you don't have any like Central philosophy to back up your claims
(2:15:05) tonight dude because I read the Bible and the Bible is like you don't ask him a single I didn't ask him a single biblical claim yeah the point you're
(2:15:12) going to try to make is keeping everything surface so that you [ __ ] bandwidth can understand it yeah
(2:15:22) not smart people well why have sex with woman Marcus I can't use higher grade philosophy because Alex don't like it
(2:15:29) hip brain not work good you make this argument is that good enough for you Alex
(2:15:37) you you don't have a grounding philosophy I do therefore I'm sorry that your worldview has to be consistent
(2:15:43) that's terrible Alex was not consistent with a 2000 year old made a book it's
(2:15:48) not even consistent within its own worldview I know a neanderthal type man who does
(2:15:55) have a Consolidated worldview so there's hope yet
(2:16:03) I'm just curious actually would you marry a woman that would never have sex with you of course not of course not so
(2:16:09) sex is the most important thing for you now in this particular case I have a duty exactly [ __ ] hang on stop stop stop
(2:16:17) can I explain there's a distinction here you are operating under the purview of
(2:16:23) promiscuous sex even outside of marriage and saying that it's not the sex itself which is the thing that's really the
(2:16:30) high value it's the [ __ ] cuddling and getting to know them aspect which is [ __ ] but even if I assumed that that
(2:16:36) was true if you're moving into marriage marriage a functional Part Stop a
(2:16:41) functional part of marriage is what procreation that's also a duty of mine that requires sex last time I checked
(2:16:48) and it's going to always require sex appropriation I didn't say sex is only
(2:16:55) for procreation I gave an example of how it's your duty to procreate and also the
(2:17:00) way that a marriage works inside of our Viewpoint is that it's a symbiosis between the church the man is
(2:17:07) symbolizing Christ as the head of the church and the woman as the body of the church and yes of course it's okay for a
(2:17:13) husband and wife to have sex it's actually encouraged in many ways because you do get all of those connectional values Etc you have five kids but you
(2:17:20) probably had with your wife therefore 99 of your sexual experience with your wife is
(2:17:26) about pleasure not Duty even if that was true it would not negate my point
(2:17:32) how is that not true you have multiple motivations I just told you even if it was true it doesn't create anything just
(2:17:39) yes of course having sex with my wife is pleasurable negates nothing I just said right so the point you're trying to make
(2:17:44) is that Marcus only operates on Pleasure and you don't but it seems that both of you guys operate largely outside
(2:17:52) I'm claiming no there is overlap of course there's overlap between these different systems but in order for him
(2:17:57) to be consistent he's literally trying to convince us that the promiscuous sex that he's out there having the promiscuous sex that you're out there
(2:18:03) having has the sex itself is not that's not really what's important it's the kissing and hand-holding
(2:18:10) him I love sliding like I don't know how if
(2:18:16) we can swear on this you can say whatever you want I love sliding my Coke in them all right it's fun you were talking about cousin [ __ ] girls
(2:18:23) I believe you brought that up Richie yeah Ricky's going back to the cousin he loves it so then the most important
(2:18:29) aspect of it is the sex why don't you just concede that that's true finally it's one of them
(2:18:37) right you just said you said a girl could be a girl you can't have a
(2:18:43) girlfriend no way and if and if and if the sex was bad you wouldn't marry her which means that the most defining
(2:18:50) aspect is
(2:19:02) so either one of these things has to be true because it's just logic right either a what's trying to convince us of
(2:19:08) that sex is not the most important thing but whether it's the kissing hand-holding cuddling and getting to know the woman right either that's the
(2:19:15) truth or that the sex is the primary component I have a difficult time
(2:19:20) believing I struggle to believe if you're going to be good faith about this that you actually are trying to convince
(2:19:26) us that uh the kissing and cuddling and hand holding and getting to know the woman is the most important aspect of
(2:19:32) why you're banging lots of chicks
(2:19:43) he can't be seen on the internet thing yeah
(2:19:49) having sex with me is multiple factors right it is not just the sex otherwise as I said I just [ __ ] prostitute someone
(2:19:55) caring that would be it it's going to be a partly a little bit of validation it's going to be partly the the interesting
(2:20:01) skill set behind it it's going to be exploring Kinks it's going to be development your own skill set it's going to be the cuddling with the girl
(2:20:07) it's going to be getting to know her it's going to be the shed vulnerability there's so many assets and we're honing in on the most important
(2:20:14) where they try to say oh but it's the most important I want to redirect and ask Rich your questions directly related
(2:20:19) to them are you married yeah why not
(2:20:24) I just gave a brief history of it earlier on were you not listening uh just quickly repeat it iterate for us
(2:20:30) Richie I wasn't listening sure I and I knew this was gonna go here because it always does with Pua guys but
(2:20:37) I don't care whatever uh yeah I was in several long relationships uh four or
(2:20:42) five years and then afterwards I sort of uh lost my faith in God or rather I
(2:20:48) became agnostic and uh became a hedonist for a while
(2:20:54) longer well longer than than I should have well
(2:21:00) doing a day is hedonist is longer than you should have um and then um I uh sort of came to the
(2:21:06) okay you know what it was it was Stefan molyneux and he was talking about um he was talking about how women pair
(2:21:13) bond with people um and I realized that I was actually doing more harm than good by Sleeping
(2:21:19) with women that I didn't have any intention of marrying and uh it put me in a difficult spot so now I'm in my 30s
(2:21:26) and uh I'm looking around and most women are either single mothers or married and
(2:21:32) um yeah it's it's tough man I put myself here when did you give up on Hedonism
(2:21:38) when did you switch over to become more I still have it entirely like I still smoke and stuff right like there's still
(2:21:44) physical pleasure in my life it's uh I'm talking about cruel in terms of sex
(2:21:49) um three years ago four years ago so okay so for the last three four years
(2:21:54) the death of the death the death father made me really heavily reflect on my life and and my choices so there you go
(2:22:00) I'm sorry I'm sorry to hear about that man uh I'm like well that's what I'm not trying to like use it I'm just saying like that's what no I understand uh yeah
(2:22:07) but so it kind of begs the question if like in your philosophy like are you
(2:22:12) gonna say that for the last three or four years you haven't had sex at all then correct okay interesting so I guess you've had
(2:22:20) four years why have you not been able to get married if that's the most important thing in your world view
(2:22:27) um well dating Mark is hard man welcome to uh America like I said those stats
(2:22:33) earlier that's where pickup comes in Richie I'll hook you up with a free
(2:22:38) ebook Okay yeah so that that way you can get a bunch of virtualist skanks who want to have sex with pickups yeah
(2:22:44) precisely I'm six five 190 pounds objectively more
(2:22:51) handsome than you you think I had probably pulling [ __ ] but I just had no problem like for the last four years you
(2:22:56) haven't been able to you haven't not that I haven't been able to I'm looking for a virtuous person do you understand the distinction you've been doing it for
(2:23:02) four years go to the bar and [ __ ] a skank well no one's talking about that basically anytime I want to you you for
(2:23:08) four years you haven't been able to accomplish your dating but just remember if you were doing that Richie if you were going to a bar and picking up
(2:23:14) skanks it wouldn't be about the sex it's because you want to hug and cuddle and look into their eyes late at night oh absolutely yeah
(2:23:29) if you're going to a club and seeing it is like picking up a skank and [ __ ] her and then kicking her out of course
(2:23:34) the sex is going to be horrible and I tell you what it's not going to be pleasurable you can keep making jokes about oh you hug and cuddle that's a big
(2:23:41) part of sex is Aftercare especially kinky sex that is very enjoyable and pleasurable which I'm sure you'll go
(2:23:46) back to but sex is more than just putting your dick in somewhere because you're speaking Chinese right now this
(2:23:52) is this is yeah I don't understand how to have
(2:23:57) hedonistic sex over years yeah it's bizarre it's a foreign concept to us tell us more I'm not telling you should
(2:24:03) be rich if you're so successful hang on Don't Run Away if you're so if you're so successful with a woman then why have
(2:24:09) you not been able to achieve your dating goal which is getting married to a virtuous woman for the last four years four years you have not been able to
(2:24:16) achieve your relationship goal why is that if you're so good with women [Music]
(2:24:23) I'm good with picking up horse but also it at my age like
(2:24:28) it's tough man dating Market's hard like how old are you looking for I'm not going to say specifically my
(2:24:34) best not not to dox myself 73. like 30s 20s 40s
(2:24:41) oh yeah I'm 18. no but uh but anyway
(2:24:46) Pua guys uh reflexively do this but it's like you you and I share an entirely different set of values and any advice
(2:24:53) any advice any advice that you would want to get that was a joke any advice
(2:24:59) that you would want to give me is basically a way of sort of demeaning or or like uh
(2:25:04) putting me on a lower uh platitude not actually trying to give you the
(2:25:10) advice that was a joke it's called humor okay so sorry Alpha of your homie so
(2:25:17) okay I I don't understand why it's the [ __ ] arguments I I don't understand why you can't just answer what like age
(2:25:22) like your 20s 30s I'm not asking to give me your exact age just give me like a ballpark who gives a [ __ ] this is
(2:25:29) because he said you have a [ __ ] point to make yeah yeah you're doing it all you're doing right
(2:25:34) now all you're doing right now you're posturing on the internet no that's what you guys are doing well he's
(2:25:40) in his 30s he's in his 30s okay there we go I don't know why I took us five minutes to get there so yeah interested
(2:25:45) he said that bro in your 30s you have spent four years trying to find a virtuous woman and you
(2:25:52) have not been able to do so because it's so hard when you're in your 30s well it's not so much it's not even
(2:25:59) so much just virtuous but the a lot of the women my age uh have children and that's a very
(2:26:05) like serious decision to make I've had siblings and family members that have like married
(2:26:11) single women and of course hasn't worked out um that's a very difficult thing to do but in your world you wouldn't be your
(2:26:18) duty and especially if they have to marry to raise somebody else's children
(2:26:23) I mean whatever my father did it I don't I'm not like opposed to it morally necessarily but it's also you know not
(2:26:31) not super attractive if you marry a girl that's only about pleasure if you marry a girl that got her gender studies
(2:26:37) degree that has two hundred thousand dollars in debt and you're expected to pay that off that's not attractive
(2:26:43) either but the child will have a better outcome if you help take care of the kid shouldn't you do it and to give the
(2:26:49) child a better alcohol married no no like if if the kid is already being taken care of by the father like
(2:26:55) Financial no no sorry oh is that a different story now Richie wait actually no no yeah
(2:27:06) I forgot so you're uh the biggest beauty is to
(2:27:12) give account all right so like I don't mind
(2:27:20) get as personal with me as you want but I just want to make a distinction here I want to make it clear that you guys
(2:27:25) [ __ ] got wrecked on this debate and now you're trying to like go into like this
(2:27:30) like 30 minutes in because you had no report
(2:27:42) let's strike that from the record we're gonna strike that from the record our
(2:27:47) moderator is offended because I'm attacking I'm notified
(2:27:52) a little emotional here's what I'm trying to explain to you is that there's a lot of inconsistencies in hypocrisies
(2:27:58) in a lot of the [ __ ] that you guys say and while the hypocrisies like what I'm
(2:28:03) literally about to tell you if you're just going through sockets one of the hypocrisies is that you say like oh well
(2:28:08) you know it's a duty you know it's the duty to take care of kids and give the kids the best outcome but you know
(2:28:15) if you marry a single mother that that kid will have a better outcome that's because the man who was supposed to be
(2:28:22) taking care of him has shirked his duty and the mom do you understand the distinction there shouldn't you step in
(2:28:28) and uh give the kid it's not my duty to step in and stop you for because you have not completed your own now
(2:28:35) but that doesn't mean that I have a dutiful obligation to take care of your children lieu of my own my highest Duty
(2:28:42) would be to my own children we all get that but then why is it well then if you get that what's the argument why is it
(2:28:48) your duty to overturn no fault divorce uh because those were that's not your [ __ ] because I have a certain type of
(2:28:54) society which I think is preferable for everybody to live in and that Society is not filled to the brim with single
(2:29:00) mothers who are creating mentally ill lunatics all over our streets but it's more preferable for Richie to marry the
(2:29:07) single mom and help raise the kid why is that more preferable tell me why that would be a better outcome when you look at the outcomes
(2:29:15) no the world view the step dad is also problematic so when you're talking about
(2:29:20) the statistics with the stepfather coming in the rates of molestation and everything else Skyrocket so when we're
(2:29:27) talking about homes we're talking about the duty between the biological parents and their own children and their
(2:29:33) shirking their duties
(2:29:49) yeah in your world view if marrying a single mum led to worse outcomes for the
(2:29:55) kids would that mean you wouldn't want anyone to marry single moms if you mean on average that yeah so the
(2:30:04) thing is is that if you're looking at averages for stepfathers it's not optimal what's optimal is if you have
(2:30:10) the parents who are intact that's what's optimal no I just answered the question
(2:30:16) it's implicit in the question so if it's a bad outcome to have stepfathers you probably shouldn't have a stepfather
(2:30:21) however everything is saying no I'm not saying I would ban it we're talking about what's optimal when you're talking
(2:30:28) about individualistic cases I think that those have to be arbitrated individually and I've never said anything to the
(2:30:34) contrary however that doesn't mean that we want to create a society where people
(2:30:40) are having to make those decisions over and over and over again because what we're producing is a single motherhood
(2:30:46) machine do you understand the distinction hypothetically right I'm talking hypothetically let's say micro
(2:30:52) Society has a lot of single mothers right now yeah and let's say according to you that having a guy come in and
(2:30:59) marry those mothers friends would lead to worse outcomes from the kids on average would you ban people
(2:31:04) from marrying single mothers I wouldn't even ban uh I wouldn't ban most of the things I advocate against I just asked
(2:31:11) for a separate adjudication system based on the ethical standards that people have that's one and then the second
(2:31:17) thing is I think that individually I think that individualism or individual
(2:31:22) arbitration for something like that is just fine people can make good choices for stepfathers for their children people can make good choices let me
(2:31:30) finish bro people can make good decisions individually for those things but if we what we should be doing always
(2:31:37) is pushing for a societal outcome which is optimal so if you're looking at what
(2:31:42) hang on stop I'm almost done if we're looking at what's optimal for society it's the intact parents they also have a
(2:31:49) duty to their own children so these are optimals people saying that individuals should
(2:31:55) make that decision it shouldn't be forced upon them now I'm saying ultimately each
(2:32:01) individual is going to have to make their decision however from a policy prescription standpoint and from a
(2:32:07) societal prescription standpoint of what Society is pushing people are more likely to make good decisions if the
(2:32:13) normalization of good decisions is what's raised up as being virtuous as a standard to follow rather than being
(2:32:19) pushed against an example of this again would be like lgbtq propaganda that's
(2:32:24) drastically increased the rates of people now I'm giving you an example we're not getting into lgbtq I'm just
(2:32:30) giving you an example of propaganda so if you look at propaganda for that that's why you see so many people who
(2:32:35) identify along the lgbtq lines is due to that propaganda if that propaganda didn't exist it's likely that they
(2:32:42) wouldn't identify that way so when we're looking at societal outcomes we're looking at what we're trying to push for
(2:32:48) optimization so going going back to what we're talking about so you would push
(2:32:53) that people should not get in relationships with single mothers I don't think that it would be optimal
(2:33:00) so the single motherhood pandemic that we have right now I think that it's far better for us to push as much propaganda
(2:33:06) as we can everywhere that we can that you know next year I am the Next
(2:33:11) Generation specifically the Next Generation understands these stats that they can make better decisions and if
(2:33:18) they make those better decisions we won't have the same single motherhood pandemic there's no curing it right now
(2:33:23) even if you have stepfathers not step fathers it's an incurable crisis
(2:33:28) so back to my question would you encourage people not to get married to single mothers no I'm not encouraging
(2:33:34) that I'm just saying that it's not an optimal solution for most people okay so you wouldn't encourage it even though
(2:33:40) it's not optimal yeah that's correct that's so what okay but you you're all about what's optimal
(2:33:47) and encouraging that a second ago yes you're talking about a distinction of the micro versus macro so when I'm
(2:33:53) talking about a macro distinction I'm talking about what I want to see Society pushing for is normalcy versus a micro
(2:33:59) distinction where I say that individuals largely are going to have to have some control over their own life there's no doubt that that's true but at the macro
(2:34:06) level the push and propaganda is definitely going to influence at the micro level how they make those decisions I'm talking Macro for both
(2:34:12) right it seems like macro you're pushing for no fault you're pushing for uh no
(2:34:18) sex before marriage right but a macro level is what I was asking would you encourage people to macro level not to
(2:34:24) marry single mothers and it sounds like you wouldn't do that I'm just wondering I would no I would push the propaganda
(2:34:30) away from that and push for a more intact family homes or at the very least
(2:34:35) if you're going to have a blended family that you take those things seriously as well so that you don't end up with you
(2:34:41) know multiple different marriages with multiple kids from different people none of those are optimal everybody who's
(2:34:48) ever been in those situations tells you essentially they're not optimal um I know I have experience with it
(2:34:54) myself so no they're not optimal situations so no I don't think that as a
(2:34:59) society we should be pushing that as being optimal at all I have a quick question if you're done
(2:35:06) with your line of questioning yeah no now it's my turn now hang on now it's my turn I answered every single question
(2:35:11) absolutely who decided that's your turn hang on did I just not ask every question you had in his line of inquiry
(2:35:17) yeah but this is this is a follow-up on what Marcus said it's like yeah I know but I want to talk to Marcus now right because he just gave me an inquiry I'd
(2:35:24) like to give him well the moderator can decide who started I think that Andrew but you you have talked a majority of
(2:35:31) this debate albeit I enjoyed it but Alex hasn't and Alex did want to make a point
(2:35:37) I think I'm not allowed to follow up with an inquiry just yeah you can totally follow up I'm literally gonna ask one or two questions
(2:35:45) do you think a single mother home was more or less successful this uh home where the stepfather comes in
(2:35:52) I would say on average it's probably uh less successful than even if you have a
(2:35:57) stepfather present really so you think that a woman by herself is going to do a
(2:36:03) better job than a woman who has a father figure who comes in and helps raise the
(2:36:09) kid no the opposite oh okay so you think okay sorry I misunderstood you so you think that the stepfather home will do
(2:36:14) better probably on average I would say that that's likely but neither one of them are optimal okay understand that all
(2:36:22) right so Richie being the kind soul that he is why would he avoid single mother uh single mothers if he joins that if he
(2:36:30) joins that family he can get a better outcome for the kids you guys actually in here
(2:36:36) you know I'm gonna well hang on you just asked me the question go ahead go ahead okay so if you're if you're discussing
(2:36:43) this in those terms you would say you would actually validate the duty that Richie has to have his own brood and
(2:36:49) from his own brood Focus His Highest Duty on that why would that not be the
(2:36:55) case that would be the fight that would be the most optimal position he could have he's tried four years apparently he's
(2:37:02) not able to you know what many people he can get who cares if it takes him a decade why would it matter if it took him a decade okay
(2:37:08) let's say Richie is Barren he cannot have kids on his own in that case should
(2:37:14) he then go ahead and marry some mother and help raise the kid now here's what I would do in the alternative I would
(2:37:20) actually just uh I would just live for the rest of my family I have siblings that uh have plenty of children
(2:37:28) I want to live near them for one thing maybe maybe I'm trying to answer the
(2:37:34) question but he could have higher duties even than that so he may have a duty that's com of compellence for uh his
(2:37:39) church to stay chased his entire life he could have higher duties than marrying a single mom within his religious
(2:37:45) framework which he does so you don't understand how a duty breakdown works you think that just because we say one
(2:37:52) thing uh which is that uh hey this could be more optimal to not have X happen that that means it's the most Optical or
(2:37:59) optimal that's not true one or that the duty breakdown is that you must do something it's an ought that you have to
(2:38:05) that's ridiculous too Hypocrites and you say one thing and do the other on what what's the hypocrisy
(2:38:12) like premarital sex that's one uh what is the actual hypocrisy
(2:38:17) are we are going to get into this again how do you bring this [ __ ] up and then when I ask you about it I don't know did
(2:38:23) you have sex with your wife before you married her yes 110 IQ
(2:38:36) hang on Alex are you circumcised uh no no okay assuming that you were
(2:38:43) circumcised would you Advocate against circumcision
(2:38:49) would I if I was circumcised would I advocate against circumcision uh I don't know enough about circumcision to like
(2:38:55) know whether it's like bad or good would you find a person to be a hypocrite if they advocated against circumcision if
(2:39:01) they themselves were circumcised well that's that's a decision that wasn't made by you was made by your
(2:39:06) parents what if it was made later in life by you if they what if they made the decision
(2:39:11) they regretted it well I would I'll probably be very suspicious of their motives and I would say like okay well
(2:39:16) does it make them a hypocrite if they got the group sized at 20 to then advocating in circumcision or isn't it
(2:39:23) is that a hypocrisy or is it not a hypocrisy let me explain to you the difference the circumstances yes no
(2:39:29) answer you will be well I'm not going to answer the way you want me to uh with the circumcision or the drug thing the
(2:39:36) circumcision or the drug example you like to use the reason you would be Advocate against that is because of
(2:39:41) negative outcomes right hey I got addicted maybe drugs it cost me you know my whole life hey the circumcision thing
(2:39:48) like [ __ ] made my penis bleed once a week right because of negative outcomes is sex block thing had bad outcomes so
(2:39:54) I'm advocating against it Alex so what's the hypocrisy stupid [ __ ] are you are you gonna agree
(2:40:02) that having sex with your wife negative outcome yes it was a negative outcome what was the negative Alex are
(2:40:10) you going to answer the question or are you going yeah well the question is does it actually make
(2:40:17) you a hypocrite to Advocate against something that you yourself have done if you think that that thing was bad in
(2:40:24) retrospect if it had a positive outcome then yes only why would it why would it matter if
(2:40:31) the outcome was positive or negative I think it makes a huge difference because if it's a positive outcome it
(2:40:36) just seems like someone who's virtue signaling and just wants his cake and eat it too if it was negative outcome
(2:40:41) it's someone who's legitimately warning people against things that you know they find to be harmful in their life it
(2:40:47) makes so hypocrisy only works around the admiration of things what was the negative outcome to you
(2:40:55) having sex with your wife before marriage we bro we were breaking our vows to Jesus Christ in our faith so you
(2:41:00) regretted yeah okay if I had to do it if I had it to do over again I would not have ever had sex
(2:41:09) with my wife outside of marriage and by the way if she died tomorrow if she died tomorrow I would not have sex with a
(2:41:16) woman outside of marriage period oh yeah tell me what's the hypocrisy
(2:41:22) girl tell me what the hypocrisy is the hypocrisies that you had premarital
(2:41:28) sex and now your virtue signaling telling other people you just said that the only way that that could be a hypocrisy is if it was a positive
(2:41:36) outcome for me and I just got done telling you it was a negative outcome for me so then it can't be a hypocrisy
(2:41:43) can it Alex wrong aren't you you might have deluded yourself that's a negative outcome but okay vast majority of people
(2:41:49) will view that as a positive outcome so how is it a hypothesis so bad that like you [ __ ] had a heart
(2:41:56) attack or something like that I think 99 of people view as a positive outcome and they would look at that so Alex so I
(2:42:02) sinned I repented of my sins and still do to this day for many Sins Not just that one and I'm going to continue to do
(2:42:09) that for the rest of my life because the osis is a process so just try to hang on hang on let me finish I need you to
(2:42:16) State how I could possibly be a hypocrite for advocating against a thing
(2:42:21) which I just got done showing you and demonstrating to you had negative outcomes to me in my life why it would
(2:42:27) be that I'm a hypocrite explain it okay uh you're a hypocrite because you
(2:42:33) say you said one thing and you did another thing I understand your argument that it wasn't enough
(2:42:39) it was in the past but it doesn't change the fact okay if I sold if I sold a cryptocoin I made a million
(2:42:46) dollars and then two years later I was talking about how nfts are bad and you shouldn't do crypto would I seem like a
(2:42:52) hypocrite would you believe me that if you gave what if you gave a reason Alex and you said that the nft is bad because
(2:42:59) uh you know you got all kinds of taxes and different things like this and it created massive problems in your life
(2:43:04) and so you Advocate that people don't do that are you a [ __ ] hypocrite then well now you're talking about negative outcomes oh okay so so if I just gave
(2:43:12) you those and demonstrated those but your response to me was well no Andrew because you did you did this thing that
(2:43:17) you're now advocating against even though I gave you the negative outcomes I just demonstrated them I just don't believe in any of the negative outcomes
(2:43:23) you mentioned I think if you if you could do it again okay I think you would do it again all day every day Andrew I
(2:43:30) think this is this is this is what I see with like the hardcore religious people they always do the opposite of what they
(2:43:35) say religious people always the opposite so I'm out cheating on my wife Alex because I'm doing the opposite of of
(2:43:41) being being uh a faithful to my wife I'm out she I'm not saying everything you're doing well I'm being hyperbolic too
(2:43:50) because because I mean if we're just gonna talk hyperbolic uh generalizations you say
(2:43:56) you're going to be hyperbolic I'll be hyperbolic right back so the thing is the answer is no you have not demonstrated I'm a hypocrite and you
(2:44:03) should retract I think I think they started from Richie's uh statement about Judy right so he said he can't get uh
(2:44:10) any women that aren't mothers essentially and we said well if
(2:44:16) it's going to help the kids is that what I said is that what I said yeah you said you couldn't get anyone
(2:44:22) exception that is not Verbatim what he said uh but you so what what
(2:44:29) I can't get anyone in this dating Market all I can get are single mothers I'm with you Marcus but the notes that I had
(2:44:36) here was Marcus said that at his age the dating Market is basically brutal I
(2:44:42) wrote that down in quotes So I know that was my thoughts he also said that most of the women that he meets that are his
(2:44:47) age are already mothers which leaves I guess one to assume he
(2:44:53) means that's a negative thing so move on it's not ideal yeah well it's not it's
(2:45:00) not ideal dude but put yourself in my shoes right like you're you're in your 30s and um
(2:45:06) cool and so your your idea is like uh you wanna you wanna wife that is uh
(2:45:14) fertile number one ninety percent of the eggs dry up at 30. and um
(2:45:21) Yeah so basically I have to yes that's true go look at Moline and now I'm rhyming
(2:45:29) um but yeah dude uh what are you getting at here
(2:45:37) I can I can [ __ ] off okay the number one duty is the church
(2:45:43) the number one duty is the representation of the way that the man represents the church and the woman has
(2:45:49) the body of the church that's the number one reason for marriage procreation is maybe a second or third okay second or
(2:45:55) third fine I'll concede second or third it's one of your top three reasons yeah to get married yeah yeah so so then
(2:46:02) why are you making excuses like women's eggs dry up and like why are you saying that
(2:46:11) um yeah it's not an excuse man it's just where I'm at okay okay cool so so wait so hang on so you're
(2:46:18) saying that Richie's failures uh as he's adhering to his duties which
(2:46:24) he considers his moral prism are wrong because he's failed
(2:46:32) we're saying there's room for Success that is not taking what I was curious about right and what room for Success
(2:46:39) what is your track record of getting people married sir my tracker what are you talking about
(2:46:44) I'm talking about other than yours of getting people married from the sounds of which you can correct me from wrong
(2:46:50) but from the sounds of it he's saying he could marry a virtuous woman but she'd
(2:46:56) be a mother and he can't find anyone that wasn't that he can correct me if I'm wrong but that's that's essentially
(2:47:01) what he was saying it's certainly it's certainly difficult to find dude I don't know all right here
(2:47:06) I'll speak in terms that you POA guys can understand I understand appreciate that um basically my my value
(2:47:14) my sexual market value uh keeps increasing and I'm hoping that I will be
(2:47:19) able to snag um a fertile you know younger woman that's that's basically my best Prospect
(2:47:26) to becoming a father and like being about sexual market value keep increasing yeah what what podcast
(2:47:31) because I keep making more money and [ __ ] look at me okay [ __ ] look at me that's uh that's
(2:47:37) a great argument you keep making more money so do you want are you going to leave with your wallet no no this is this is genuinely speaking this is
(2:47:43) generally speaking like how wait Richard are you going to use your money worse
(2:47:48) you need a girl is that you're gonna love it um women are primarily concerned with uh
(2:47:55) resources if you can't if you can't provide research why why is there a contradiction to say a virtuous woman would not be after security that doesn't
(2:48:01) make any sense well he thinks that his ability he can give security now right yeah he can give a form of security but
(2:48:08) that does not necessarily mean that he's going to uh not have to search for a long time for this the type of Christian
(2:48:14) woman that he wants it has the virtues that he wants that's willing to give him the children he wants that may be a search it takes a while let me explain
(2:48:20) to me he can't find someone because he doesn't have enough money I'm looking for a diamond hang on stop stop Marcus
(2:48:27) repeat my argument back to me that I just gave you repeat it back it sounded like he was saying that he
(2:48:34) needs more resources in order to find this virtual what was my argument that they won what was my argument that's
(2:48:40) what it sounded like you were saying I didn't say a word about that all right well then what were you saying okay close attention now so that you can get
(2:48:47) this correct what I said was that it could take a long while for him to find a virtuous woman that fits the criteria
(2:48:55) that he has for his very rigid ethical system why is that problematic he's
(2:49:00) indicating that it will be easier when his smv increases specifically his money so we're asking them maybe is that
(2:49:06) actually going to help because of course uh women who are inside the purview of
(2:49:12) our moral system also understand the duties a man has to provide them with security and provide them with these
(2:49:17) other values we won't provide them with security right now well that doesn't mean that there's not other options
(2:49:23) within the purview of these virtues doesn't mean that just because you have the virtues and the woman has the virtues that everything just lines up
(2:49:30) that's right so these virtuous women are going to be
(2:49:35) more likely to date Richie once he has more money but they're virtuous woman right no that's not what I said that's
(2:49:42) ridiculous what I said was that they may not align with the value structures it could be any number of different reasons
(2:49:48) however he might consider his strategy for finding one of these women to take
(2:49:53) his time accrue his resources to give the maximum value to his family he possibly can when he does find that
(2:49:59) woman what in the world could possibly be wrong with that I'm engaging with what Richie said and
(2:50:04) he said that his uh his smv is going to go up and that's going to be the big thing that's going to help him meet a
(2:50:10) wife when I asked him about smv he specifically alluded to money what is SMB
(2:50:16) I'm sorry is that not a factor Alex uh I don't think money is going to help you
(2:50:22) accomplish your goal no yeah I actually don't think money will help you
(2:50:30) you don't think money is going to help you raise a family yeah money's not going to help with a family at all
(2:50:41) one of the most virtuous people I know one of the most virtuous people one of
(2:50:46) the most virtuous people I know uh is a family member of mine I have a cousin and also my brother
(2:50:53) um they worked their [ __ ] nuts off uh to acquire uh what they have my cousin's
(2:50:59) actually a woman beautiful woman but her her partner uh similar in age he's a bit
(2:51:05) older than me um they are multi-millionaires living very virtuous lives and they started
(2:51:11) early they started having kids early um but absolutely
(2:51:17) particularly with what's around the corner like like very soon
(2:51:23) um I think that the type of woman that I would be looking for would be interested
(2:51:28) in having a man that could provide a substantial amount of wealth
(2:51:33) for them in fact I think that if I were to find a woman that um sort of just uh
(2:51:39) fell into my lap I I would have basically look at them as a bar fly I I wouldn't see it as as so so if you want
(2:51:48) if you want a gold digger I see yeah no you're [ __ ] it doesn't sound like a
(2:51:53) virtuous woman like do you feel like you're [ __ ] wait at this point in time can you not take care of a family
(2:51:59) do you not have the resources what is that it's a non-sequitur bro it's a complete and total
(2:52:05) non-sequiturate right now well you could raise the future because if that's the argument then we
(2:52:11) don't have a disagreement if you're saying Hey listen man I don't have any money right now and I can't raise a family then I'll say okay fair enough
(2:52:16) but if you're holding down no no my my argument is that I haven't been able to find a virtuous woman that's fertile
(2:52:24) um particularly in my area which is well whatever it seems like the main thing that you think is going to help you with
(2:52:30) that is making more money um absolutely it is no that's not what he said though
(2:52:36) and I'll clarify it's very simple what he's saying he's saying that until he finds a virtuous woman what is the
(2:52:43) problem with him accruing resources for the potentiality of his future family what would that be problematic that's
(2:52:49) not what he's saying is that not what you're saying Richie no it's not what he's saying no effectively yes like if I found a virtuous
(2:52:55) all right if I found a virtuous woman now that was working and like was into me and whatever like we could make a job
(2:53:01) great and you know I want her I want her I want her
(2:53:09) uh to have the opinion that she's going to be a stay-at-home mother she's going to multiply and that's that's really
(2:53:16) [ __ ] tough right now so like that's what weighs on my mind heavily when I'm uh looking for a mate man I don't know
(2:53:22) okay I don't know how that's like difficult to understand me right now is that what you're saying if that's what you're saying then I get it it's fine
(2:53:28) but what you sounded like you were saying was that the more money you get it's gonna be easy to find a goal and
(2:53:33) that's why you can't find a girl right now if you'll sound like I don't have enough money to raise a family so I'm not even gonna look for a goal yeah dude
(2:53:39) this is the most session let me let me let me restate this position the best way that I possibly
(2:53:46) can Andrew the position the position was simple with all due respect he's been cutting me off every time I have an
(2:53:52) inquiry with this other guy I will be fair and I do have a good
(2:53:58) point if you disagree then I digress but to be fair Richie was and Marcus
(2:54:03) specifically were having a back and forth interaction I I think that it would be to the I think that they
(2:54:09) Integrity of the debate would be upheld most if Richie was able to speak for himself and actually clarify his oh but
(2:54:16) it's not okay when I'm cross-examining Marcus for him to speak for himself Alex chimes in that's [ __ ] no thanks so
(2:54:22) back to where I was at let me just restate let me just restate this position because it's very it's a
(2:54:29) simple let me let me now listen to the lottery because whatever the [ __ ] I want dude
(2:54:40) let Richie answer his own questions okay as long as you promise that after that's
(2:54:46) done and I cross-examine Marcus you shut your mouth nope okay then go ahead Andrew to be fair
(2:54:54) like I I I don't know I feel like I've tried my very very best to be on everybody's side
(2:55:00) I like all of you guys except Richie and and this is a contentious debate don't take any of this personal oh you know me
(2:55:07) um but I I I just genuinely mean what I say and this is between Richie and Marcus and I think that uh I do think
(2:55:14) yeah you did you did just hear that Alex said he's not going to say a word when I cross-examine Marcus when this is done right okay perfect
(2:55:21) I love everybody except Richie some
(2:55:31) personally when I talked about the weather we're like searching this comment perfectly perfectly sums up the
(2:55:38) issue at hand what Marcus is trying to say hold on Nick is trying to ask a question or are you asking
(2:55:47) Alex I'll bring it up again I'll bring it up again what it sounded like what you were
(2:55:52) saying is that you can't find a virtual school right now unless she's a mother but you said you're increasing your smv
(2:55:59) and that's what's going to help you find a woman we asked what was your smv you said money right so I'm put put your
(2:56:05) well no my smv obviously isn't just money I mean I've like run circles around you guys logically like I'm obviously intelligent I'm obviously
(2:56:12) better looking than both of you combined actually your books are decreasing if you put your looks actually if you
(2:56:18) put your looks combined you might actually be an uglier person
(2:56:27) we just had the moderator okay well then if that's the case then he just threw the rules off mod so let me restate his
(2:56:34) position I'm just going to talk over again there's gonna be a total [ __ ] Trail so well then I mean we'll do that because you don't want your boy
(2:56:39) cross-examined by me Alex you know it I don't care if cross-examine it was just funny he said that he's he referenced me
(2:56:46) he said that he he's better looking than me and I'm making jokes saying that agrees to the ground rules breaks him
(2:56:52) immediately genius Alex great look bro to be fair he was making a humorous comment he wasn't coming to save anyone
(2:56:58) go out come do it you guys shush I'll shush too I'll even quit with the faces
(2:57:06) I I mean Richie if you want Andrew to come in and give his opinion on it I don't mind it's just that that's did you
(2:57:12) just shut the [ __ ] up while I talk like it that's fine
(2:57:19) because I hate because I hate pickup artists you have a lot of hatred yeah it
(2:57:24) feels that way oh I do I hate Wicked I'm not a big fan but what about Christ bro
(2:57:30) what about not here five times bro yeah if you could just like all right let's
(2:57:36) do it what are you going to say um yeah no it's not the uh it's not the
(2:57:42) the primary reason um there's a lot of different reasons I have had crazy life [ __ ] happen to me
(2:57:47) but whatever it's like I'm not making excuses the number one thing that I can find is that young fertile women
(2:57:53) particularly attractive young fertile women are looking for a level of um a
(2:57:58) lot of things like uh whatever um my best chance if I meet that girl
(2:58:05) right and then it's like we just click I wouldn't want to start a family with her immediately anyway if I wasn't secure
(2:58:12) enough in uh in the future uh uh for for creating those children I think I could
(2:58:17) probably swing it just uh because of family connections Etc but it's not even really it man like I'm I'm basically
(2:58:24) just focusing on gaining enough resources that I could start a family if
(2:58:29) it happened and and even more than that what I've recently noticed is that
(2:58:34) um living for myself being being selfish with with my money uh is is deleterious
(2:58:41) it's it's corrosive to my soul
(2:58:46) when I do things for other people I notice that I have a much more of a benefit and so
(2:58:52) my money goes to like saving and uh if if worse comes to worse I really don't
(2:58:59) mind just being a good uncle figure to mine dozens of nieces and nephews
(2:59:05) um it doesn't it doesn't hurt me at all and no I don't think that like cat like is as um
(2:59:13) as desirable as it is you know whatever I'm still a man to uh have sex with with
(2:59:19) uh easy [ __ ] it's just not desirable to me like like it's not I know that it
(2:59:25) would [ __ ] me up in the end I know that ultimately it's like uh it's just a soul
(2:59:30) thing man I don't know I don't know how to explain it I'm sorry I'm rambling but I've been up to sleep early
(2:59:36) no it's five Amy for me so I get it no yeah I understand if that works for you right that's completely fine it's just
(2:59:43) that earlier on this bait it seemed like you were forcing people to make it a
(2:59:48) certain decision right and so right now we're seeing anyone we were already optimization right it's optimal and
(2:59:56) the reason I was bringing it up is it seems like it's more optimal for you to be with a single mother right now since
(3:00:01) you couldn't find anyone else right but if you're saying that's not the reason and it's just like you're not ready right now and you're working on things
(3:00:07) and you won't have enough money so you can support a family then that's a different argument I understand but it's not it's interesting that this argument
(3:00:14) became about me it's like typical Pua guys but that's fine um what do you mean by typical I don't
(3:00:19) mind well because you go you guys don't have arguments uh against these like
(3:00:25) broader Spectrum um consistently uh throwing out uh oh well
(3:00:31) what about this what about that naxalt just nonsense and um that you got crush in your arguments and so what you
(3:00:37) typically like to do is is you'll find a guy that hasn't been um reproductively successful and you'll
(3:00:43) say oh well well here's what you need to do Richard you just gotta because you're you're
(3:00:49) your uh followers reproductively successful I don't but
(3:00:55) it's like you were using your world view to say that we should be having kids and
(3:01:00) it's our duty yet you didn't want to do it with single mothers that's why I brought it up
(3:01:05) well in my worldview I don't mind if you don't have kids I don't mind if you focus on your nieces nephews dude we talked about this earlier 40 times more
(3:01:12) likely to be sexy I don't know if you guys are done with the inquiry right because it's getting it's getting circular but if you are I would like to
(3:01:19) move into my cross-examination thank you but with two people listening there was still a lot of interest from the chat and I think that Marcus was just getting
(3:01:26) to a point okay yeah I mean I've yeah I've kind of made
(3:01:31) my point that's right if Richie wants to say anything else he can but um it's whatever dude the internet is a
(3:01:37) Fickle place and uh people don't really watch debates to to have their minds changed they sort of watch their debates
(3:01:43) to have their positions reinforced um I hope that there's some possibility
(3:01:49) that some people are actually considering like hey it's kind of [ __ ] up I guess I guess uh don't be a bad
(3:01:56) example would be my my life and you could criticize that as much as you want but I've been broadly open and honest
(3:02:01) and um okay there it is Market or anything else any points with no no that's cool that
(3:02:08) you wanted to kind of hone in on or huh so good all right okay Marcus would
(3:02:15) you be willing to mandate your preferences on society uh which preferences I don't know
(3:02:21) whatever preference is doesn't matter it's irrelevant to me like people shouldn't kill each other preferences whatever the preferences are
(3:02:29) okay uh yeah preference what I I would have is that people do not murder each other
(3:02:35) okay so that's one preference right so and you have no trouble mandating those preferences on society right because you
(3:02:41) believe that those things are optimal it's optimal for people not to kill each other murder each other probably not kill but murder
(3:02:47) that specific preference yes and would you say the same thing about theft
(3:02:53) uh yeah so it says and would you say the same thing about adultery
(3:03:00) um probably I mean probably probably
(3:03:05) all right right so and why would adultery be bad at different levels right so yeah uh
(3:03:12) if yeah I wouldn't punish anyone in terms of they should go to prison if
(3:03:17) that's what you're asking okay so then willing to enforce your preference I would personally say no I wouldn't enforce that preference that's correct
(3:03:24) so what's wrong though if you know that it's wrong or immoral which you just got done saying for somebody else to enforce
(3:03:30) that preference why would that be wrong enforce it on society or on themselves
(3:03:37) enforcement on society that if you if you're an adulterer you go to jail why would that be wrong or immoral or bad
(3:03:44) um because in my world view I think they're going to be things that are
(3:03:50) optimal that we shouldn't punish or that aren't optimal that we shouldn't punish so for example like guns uh could be an
(3:03:58) example of that I think societies with guns probably leads to more murders probably leads to uh more people
(3:04:05) killing themselves things like that but at the end of the day I think people should probably have the right if they
(3:04:11) choose to earn guns right yeah but why would it be bad to enforce those things that are optimal
(3:04:16) yeah but why would not going into free speech be bad that's my question is I'm trying to figure out why these things in
(3:04:22) your purview which you agree are bad why it would be bad to enforce that they no longer exist why would that be a problem
(3:04:29) because they're like positive and negatives to it so if we're taking sex before marriage for example there are a
(3:04:35) lot of positive side effects before marriage right there's some negatives as well so for that reason I wouldn't uh
(3:04:41) enforce it right so it's all based around the consequences right
(3:04:48) okay consequences play a role yes well what else would play the role if you're saying that you you agree that thing X
(3:04:54) is bad but the consequence of enforcing it is worse then you're really just
(3:04:59) looking at the consequences of the action aren't you uh sure yeah so if that's the case and
(3:05:06) consequences or what matter the most for you then if it can be demonstrated their consequences personally there are
(3:05:13) consequences I understand so if whatever those criteria were that it was proven
(3:05:19) to you that these things were bad within the purview of all of those different small nuanced criteria that the outcomes
(3:05:26) were still bad then then you should Advocate to enforce it shouldn't you no
(3:05:32) because I think for example like fatty foods um like fast foods like let's let's pick
(3:05:38) McDonald's or something you could probably prove that it's negative for the individual you can probably
(3:05:44) presented for the society but I feel still feel like there's an element of like uh Choice there that should be
(3:05:50) allowed why though that doesn't do don't you understand that doesn't follow for you
(3:05:55) to tell me listen Andrew what I care about more than anything is the consequence and this is demonstrated
(3:06:01) when I go through the name inquiry with you and we find out that nuanced hang on that's your nuanced personal price stop
(3:06:08) the nuanced personal preference is the only reason you want to take away or don't want to take away choices if the
(3:06:13) consequence of taking away the choice is worse do you understand that's the only reason you have an
(3:06:19) argument for what is that and what's good yes but there's a negative consequence from taking away Choice as well okay so can you tell me what the
(3:06:26) negative consequence of taking away the choice D to McDonald's [ __ ] cheeseburger is well obviously that's a trivial example
(3:06:33) right but I think Society based why is it trivial because it's a cheeseburger yeah so what
(3:06:39) that's my whole point my whole point though is that why would it be bad to say no more McDonald's cheeseburgers
(3:06:46) under your purview when consequences are what matters this is a problem with you guys you're walking contradictions
(3:06:52) choice right I think that's negative in itself you haven't demonstrated why taking away that choice would be a
(3:06:58) negative because I feel like people should be allowed to eat whatever they want because you feel
(3:07:05) and that's what all of this always is with you guys it's how I feel you can't
(3:07:10) demonstrate any of this none of it's consistent and makes no sense I don't give a [ __ ] how you feel about people
(3:07:16) eating cheeseburgers why shouldn't I enforce that McDonald's shut down tomorrow other than because it would make you feel bad did you think we
(3:07:24) should not let people eat cheeseburgers no that's beside the points of non-sequitur what I'm asking
(3:07:30) specifically is I'm asking if you whether I do whether I believe that or don't believe that it's an internal
(3:07:36) critique of your worldview I'm trying to figure asking about your world view do you not share the same world view as me no I don't share the same worldview as
(3:07:43) you and you can ask me about my world view in just a second and I will answer all of your questions you have when
(3:07:49) we're done we're almost done I promise I just need this answered for me what would be the huge negative societal
(3:07:57) impact against choice for me to say nobody else could ever have a McDonald's
(3:08:02) cheeseburger again
(3:08:09) I will answer that question as soon as you answer mines my inquiry so I answer
(3:08:14) my question you'll ask me why choice is good enough I know I'm asking you why that specific Choice the specific choice
(3:08:20) of the McDonald's cheeseburger if it's enforced that nobody else can ever eat another McDonald's cheeseburger that
(3:08:26) choice is taken away from them why in the world would that be a bad thing Marcus I think in general our society is
(3:08:32) probably going to do better if we give people these types of choices so it could be a cheeseburger
(3:08:39) um it could be the type of treatment they have at hospital whatever it is right or if they want to get a tattoo or if they want to get an ear piercing I
(3:08:45) think having individualized Choice actually improves Society in general do
(3:08:51) you do you think that you have a choice to blow a stop sign but this is what I was saying where
(3:08:56) there's certain choices you can and certain choices you can't I don't I don't feel like I find the choice to go
(3:09:01) and murder someone because the consequences of society I think when we add choice in society in the general
(3:09:07) scheme of things there's better consequences and obviously some of those choices we have to restrict like blowing
(3:09:13) a stop sign or drink driving or not eating a cheeseburger at McDonald's because if we're going if we're trying
(3:09:19) to be consistent here Marcus you're still just saying the same exact thing which is the negative outcome levels
(3:09:26) is very different than me killing someone I didn't say that it wasn't however you blowing you blowing through
(3:09:33) a stop sign at 2 A.M when there's nobody on the road probably not a big deal but you should probably still stop right you
(3:09:39) should probably still stop because the potential consequence is bad just like the eating of the Jesus you're potentially killing someone like
(3:09:45) cheeseburger there isn't a chance that I run into someone going wait a second wait a second the massive industry which
(3:09:51) is McDonald's and this and that which is responsible for a massive obesity epidemic amongst other things which you
(3:09:56) would concede is true these are all terrible where'd he go what happened oh no sir I'm still here
(3:10:02) man okay these are all terrible outcomes for all of these people these are terrible outcomes for everybody and yet
(3:10:08) you still uh you seem to just optimize your choice based on arbitrary preference this is my whole problem it's
(3:10:14) my whole issue and you really haven't reconciled that Marcus yeah I would say it's sorry give me one
(3:10:21) second sure uh I would say there's levels to this so if you could prove to me that a McDonald's for example is
(3:10:28) causing a huge detriment Society it's absolutely [ __ ] ruining it and that a bunch of people are dying and it's
(3:10:34) really horrible then that probably would be something that I'd want to punish somehow whether it be taxes or just
(3:10:39) outlawing in general yeah sure right but if cheeseburgers make some people a
(3:10:45) little bit fat or people eat cheeseburgers and are completely fine and have a healthy diet and they can make that choice then yeah that's
(3:10:51) probably something that I wouldn't restrict in my walls so these are all you can prove to me the sex before if you could prove to me that sex before
(3:10:58) marriage completely ruins Society right if you would have approve that I'd probably agree but you haven't and we
(3:11:04) have so that was my so that's where I wanted to get to and I appreciate so much that you brought that up because
(3:11:10) that's where we were trying to get to so I have demonstrated that no fault divorce which was the topic of this has
(3:11:16) indeed radically raised single motherhood women are responsible no not
(3:11:23) only that I sent over multiple studies Alex can put him in the private chat zero studies they're in the private chat
(3:11:28) right now what else can I possibly do I sent them
(3:11:34) all do you want me to take 20 minutes off the stream and go through this no my
(3:11:40) whole point is is that this was demonstrated not only that it's been logically demonstrated over and over again that the single motherhood
(3:11:46) pandemic which once again all rightly hang on hang on let me finish
(3:11:52) miserable let me just finish and I'll give it back you can make whatever inquiries you want then Marcus I promise
(3:11:58) but it has been demonstrated we did logically demonstrate it and I sent over tons and tons of evidence the
(3:12:05) correlatory is so overwhelmingly strong that no fault divorce has LED and is a
(3:12:11) massive contributing factor in the single motherhood pandemic which then trickles down to again let me read you
(3:12:17) the stats hang on let me read you the stats and if you tell me if you dispute any of these 89 of kids do not have it
(3:12:25) who are in a psych or do not have an intact family fatherless homes are 90 of
(3:12:30) homeless kids fatherless home 85 percent behavioral disorder fatherless home seventy percent of kids in juvenile hall
(3:12:36) fatherless home 71 of teens no no don't say nothing let me finish
(3:12:41) and then again I said you can have the whole floor you can have the floor 71 of
(3:12:47) teens in rehab facilities follow us home single motherhood obviously there is no
(3:12:53) dispute that single motherhood is the cause of these problems without the intact family you can't even just
(3:13:03) it is crazy because if you have an intact family they're probably going to be more happy more well put together and
(3:13:10) have better outcomes if you have a single mother there's probably divorce for a reason now if you take all those
(3:13:16) single mothers again sustain a relationship it doesn't seem like these [ __ ] feminist talking points bro
(3:13:22) literally feminist talking points the man if you feel something to be in a
(3:13:27) relationship go go ahead with your inquiry I promised I'd answer whatever questions you have
(3:13:34) go ahead let's learn for closing thoughts after Marcus go ahead
(3:13:39) if all you're comparing it in Tech Families versus single mothers we're gonna assume those single mother
(3:13:45) families they've got divorced for a reason right so they probably already have [ __ ] going on within that family
(3:13:51) but what I'm saying is if you now create a situation where you have a uh parents
(3:13:57) that are bickering that hate each other that it's awful and then you force them to stay together whether the guy whether
(3:14:02) the girl then I don't think that's going to lead to good outcomes and I think what we spoke about before the ability to have a choice we both agreed is
(3:14:09) important I think they should both have a choice to leave that relationship if they're miserable on enjoying it those
(3:14:14) are literal feminist talking points and I demonstrated for you and I and yeah apparently
(3:14:21) I demonstrated that pre no fault divorce these marriages stayed intact and there was
(3:14:28) not these massive abuses going on in these homes or was none of that we know this because of the outcomes of the
(3:14:34) people who were produced by those are the Dynamics of marriages have changed a lot right we know that there's so many
(3:14:40) other variables advocating for promiscuity and being a feminist like the rest of the feminists advocating
(3:14:46) your same feminism
(3:14:54) big brain big brains unironically unironically yes yeah we have more
(3:15:00) virtue signaling okay he just agreed he was a feminist what are you talking about virtue signaling he's joking dude
(3:15:06) he's [ __ ] with you not pick up on basic sarcasm well I guess in the future in the future
(3:15:11) you shouldn't make feminist talking points then claim that you're a feminist and say it's irony bro
(3:15:17) because I say one thing do you think a feminist would agree with the owner makes me a feminist no all of your
(3:15:22) talking points have been feminist talking points in fact yeah all of them I can't even think of one argument that
(3:15:28) you have made that was not a feminism you said it was true so it's got to be true yeah
(3:15:34) it's a fact you think the audience doesn't see that yeah it's a fact
(3:15:44) yeah I'm open for inquiry I promised I would be uh
(3:15:50) uh I don't I don't have any more questions for you honestly if Marcus knows question from the chat I can come up
(3:15:56) with some if you want me to the chat many people in the chat have wanted to know are you planning on opening the panel at all or are we doing closing
(3:16:03) thoughts and then heading now and then I'm [ __ ] okay we can do like 20. it
(3:16:09) depends on what the rest of you guys I can't I can't guys I have I have other stuff to do this evening I do appreciate
(3:16:15) very much the uh the debate I'll Stick Around for like super chats and stuff I think that that's totally fair but I
(3:16:21) have my own chat and my own show to get back to after the debate is done and I have my own Super chats and guys I I got
(3:16:27) to take care of on my end so yeah okay so closing thoughts yeah who wants to go
(3:16:32) first I'll go first uh okay yeah [ __ ] it um effectively everything
(3:16:37) boiled down to in this debate uh naxalt uh not all X are like that every logical
(3:16:44) position that was presented by Andrew and I it was totally refuted by well
(3:16:50) actually there are single moms that do this or or actually people who will operate in this I I I couldn't find a
(3:16:57) logical argument in in the entire debate that we had and it and it and it varied
(3:17:03) greatly we would go from from Marriage to like every single point that was made
(3:17:09) it was always a a pivot and then okay so so uh when I brought up when I brought
(3:17:17) up the single mothers having children that were 40 more likely to be physically or sexually abused it was all
(3:17:22) just sort of hand waving well I know that single mothers are I know single mothers that that whatever man my mother
(3:17:28) was a single mother when I was 12 okay like I understand that there are exceptions but you you never actually
(3:17:34) addressed the arguments at all um
(3:17:40) they take you took no responsibility for the negative repercussions of your
(3:17:46) actions because truthfully down to your core everything
(3:17:51) is an excuse in your and I know that you don't perceive it this way but this is how I perceive your arguments everything
(3:17:58) is an excuse for your Hedonism everything is is basically around how
(3:18:04) much pleasure can I get out of things it it has no serious purpose you have no
(3:18:09) serious like pillars or foundation for the way that you think that you do outside of literally your physical
(3:18:16) feeling even down to Mark is talking about oh well I need to have a you know oh well sex is great you know good sex
(3:18:23) is good even to the point where like I can't actually get married to a woman if if we don't have sexual compatibility
(3:18:29) but then he would sort of like make this like woo-woo excuse of like oh well you know cuddling on the pillow and then
(3:18:35) like we touch each other's hair and scratch it feels good even that even that which sounds good to a woman by the
(3:18:41) way particularly a young woman that that is like oh he really cares about me and
(3:18:46) it does feel good don't get me wrong like I understand like that connection between men and women it does feel good but it's like it's still just pleasure
(3:18:54) there there's nothing there there like there's nothing
(3:19:00) there's no morality it's literally just pleasure Hedonism that's it thank you
(3:19:05) Richie can I go next of course all right so the debate
(3:19:10) strategy with Andrew and rich is basically I have a ground informal by all of you
(3:19:17) oh I'm right that's the common argument I hear over and over and cut out you did I didn't know if it was just me no it
(3:19:25) was God actually God cut you out I'm sure it was okay anyway so the debate strategy with the injured virtues
(3:19:30) basically I have a grounded for my world view based on a 2000 year old book full of fiction and you don't so I'm right also the level of hypocrisy and virtue
(3:19:37) signaling here was off the charts we have a guy who accuses Marcus of being primarily obsessed with pleasure who
(3:19:42) chained smokes and drinks who says that premarital sex is bad who had premarital sex with his wife allegedly Other Woman
(3:19:49) then we have a guy who believes marriage is one of the most important things yeah he has been single for four years he
(3:19:54) says he wants a virtuous woman yet the main thing he believes will help him with that is making more money
(3:20:00) you guys could the hypocrisy you learn can't make this [ __ ] out but I will give props to both Andrew and Richie for
(3:20:05) coming on it was a fun discussion and I enjoyed having it uh like Andrew to go next that way we have one from one side
(3:20:11) one from one side back and forth is that okay with you Andrew sure okay yeah so
(3:20:17) this uh this is absolutely hilarious we didn't talk about our groundation belief at all until it was brought up to us all
(3:20:23) I did was a basic internal critique on this guy's world view and what he thought about things and we found that
(3:20:28) most of this is feminist style talking points I didn't talk about grounding Christian ethics I didn't talk about any
(3:20:34) of that that was brought up by my opponent in fact I was happy to keep it within whatever purview he wanted and
(3:20:40) when they requested we move on I was happy to do that too that's all cope [ __ ] that's one second as we walk
(3:20:48) through this try to understand that these they demanded data we handed them data it still wasn't good enough they
(3:20:53) demanded logical arguments we gave them logical arguments still wasn't good enough they tried to convince us that
(3:20:59) sex that they're going out and having sex with tons and tons of skanks Marcus says because he wanted a physical
(3:21:05) connection with a woman to look into her eyes to gaze into to to have an emotional connection had enough the sex
(3:21:11) that was like that you know that wasn't even that's not even really a priority it's not even really a big deal for him
(3:21:16) that's like secondary bull [ __ ] [ __ ] that's three now moving on from there
(3:21:22) when we get into Marx's world view makes no sense he's a consequentialist he's absolutely not consistent with any of
(3:21:29) the things that he says with things that he advocates for makes no sense whatsoever also for anybody to challenge
(3:21:36) that no fault divorce a thing which we have tons of data on I mean it's
(3:21:42) astronomical and overwhelming the data we have on single moms and no fault divorce and to challenge that with a
(3:21:48) feminist talking point of but some women might be getting mistreated in their marriage is [ __ ] ridiculous we know
(3:21:56) this because we we can look at the patterns before no fault divorce and this was not happening they weren't
(3:22:02) being abused they weren't being beaten up they weren't none of that [ __ ] was going on any more than it is now and the
(3:22:08) out outcomes for the children were far better they couldn't refute a word of what was said they could they literally
(3:22:13) couldn't refute any of it now do I have a problem with Marcus no right you invite me to a debate I'm a debater
(3:22:19) we're going to have it out that doesn't mean I have any personal animosity towards you Marcus
(3:22:24) um and I'm happy that you came on and had this discussion and as with Alex it's always a pleasure always happy to
(3:22:30) discuss these things with you I have no animosity towards either of you guys however debates are aggressive they're
(3:22:36) brutal we're gonna get down on the dirt and also try to remember this last thing which that Alex says there's massive
(3:22:43) hypocrisies on my side I was willing to yield that there possibly could have been so he got into his definition of
(3:22:48) hypocrisy which changed three times not only did it change three times but when I literally sat him down and said now
(3:22:54) show me how I'm a hypocrite all the examples he'd come up with showed that I wasn't a hypocrite these people are
(3:23:00) [ __ ] nuts they don't know what the hell they're talking about and I was glad to come in and wreck both of them
(3:23:05) handily so anyway thanks guys I appreciate that very much all right Marcus all right the
(3:23:12) hedonistic puea feminists uh this is uh so essentially that's a good safe Marcus
(3:23:19) I appreciate it man and don't worry I love you too Andrew don't worry um yeah essentially uh just resetting the point
(3:23:26) six before marriage um I don't think it's a problem whatsoever I think it does allow you to
(3:23:31) cuddle look deep into someone's eyes and actually build a further connection of course the sex is also amazing you get
(3:23:37) to tie those up to have fun you get to explore your kinks but at the end of the day you get to find out whether you're actually compatible with this girl or
(3:23:43) not and sure there's a big difference between [ __ ] around quite a lot or meeting someone getting to know them
(3:23:48) having sex and then if you want to get married get married in terms of the uh no fault divorce I was actually never
(3:23:55) showing stats I know you send them to Alex but you never sent any to me um even if divorce was to go up a little
(3:24:01) bit I still don't think this shows that it is um going to be more beneficial if you
(3:24:07) take people that [ __ ] hate each other a guy that can't stand this woman and just wants to get away from him and make
(3:24:12) him stay in that relationship it's a good thing I'd rather give the guy a choice or sorry I'm a feminist I'd
(3:24:18) rather give the girl a choice to be able to leave um so that's uh that's my thoughts and thanks everyone I appreciate issue
(3:24:23) patriarchy all the way she gets no choice they get no choice I'm kidding I'm joking yeah no they get whatever
(3:24:31) choice we they get the choice that we give them I think that that's I do want to say that you know there's people in
(3:24:36) the chat saying like oh you and Andrew are no longer friends no we're still friends uh this is all just debate you
(3:24:42) know the whatever blood Sports I have literally no problem whatsoever there's
(3:24:47) no hard feelings with Alex at all and I'm sure that we'll have future conversations where me and him will be on the same side wrecking feminists the
(3:24:54) one thing I'll say about the red pillars including all of you out there in Alex's chat I agree with 90 of the descriptive
(3:25:01) claims that you guys make that's why I broadly consider a lot of the red pillars to be allies in the same type of
(3:25:07) conflict that I'm engaged with with the progressive left in feminists just don't agree with their prescriptions which is
(3:25:12) why we're kind of tangling up on a lot of those today I find Alex to be a very thoughtful good man at least he's always
(3:25:19) been decent to me I have absolutely no issues with him personally but I'm not here to be nice to him I'm here to kick
(3:25:25) his ass in the debate and that's what I did like to plug your channel tell viewers
