(4:21) [Music] Hey everybody. Today we're debating Christianity versus secularis humanism

(4:28) and which is better for society. And we're starting right now with Mark Reed's opening statement. Thanks for

(4:35) being with us. Mark, the floor is all yours. Thank you so much, James. And I'll just u share my screen. I'll just get it up

(4:42) in Zoom. So my apologies. I'm kind of a bit all over the place. Um, I'm just using a new program. So, uh, bear with

(4:49) me while I get sorted. Share. And, um, I just have to find the right

(4:57) window or else I'm going to be sad. Uh, let's have a look. Uh, no, that's not it. Yeah, my apologies. I've just

(5:04) haven't used this setup before, so I'm just a little behind the ball. But, uh, if you bear with me.

(5:10) No problem. Folks, want to let you know if you saw in the pre-stream screen, we

(5:15) have an upcoming in-person debate. You could say our outnumbered series, Five on Five, Destiny versus Five Folks from

(5:22) Los Angeles. If you happen to be in Los Angeles, shoot us an email. More to come on that. With that, Mark, the floor is

(5:29) all yours. Thank you so much. Um, so my name's Mark Reed and I'm a secular humanist. I'm

(5:35) here to talk about secular humanism, why it's superior to Christianity or any theistic uh uh morality system. I would

(5:42) like to thank James and modern day debate for having me on and Andrew for being here to debate. I'm so glad he

(5:48) managed to work up the fortitude to make it today. So, first off, I want to really talk about what secular humanism

(5:54) actually is. Um, secular humanism is quite often misrepresented as just being secularism or atheism. And while I'm an

(6:01) atheist and atheist simply oh sorry I didn't do the slide. Yeah, there we go.

(6:07) Um simply believes that no uh uh gods exist which is not really any kind of

(6:12) philosophy or worldview. It's simply a belief position and that's atheism. Secularism can be almost any worldview

(6:19) that is religion neutral. So it would be a mistake to lump a humanistic philosophy like secular humanism under a

(6:26) broad category such as secular as it doesn't tell you anything about what the beliefs are. I do also want to point out

(6:31) that secular humanism is not against religion or anti-Christianity. It's simply religion neutral relying on

(6:38) shared evaluation of the world in order to chart a path towards a goal of human well-being. Um now for most of it uh it

(6:46) it uh it uses uh sorry just one second I just got to yeah here we go here we go.

(6:53) Um secular humanism uses a philosophical school called utilitarianism to evaluate our choices which looks at the

(7:00) reasonable consequences of an action and evaluates whether it will lead to human well-being or towards human suffering.

(7:06) We can evaluate any act in what outcome it would reasonably lead to while preserving human dignity and worth to

(7:13) the benefit of all humans. Um now secular humanists recognize that

(7:18) humans are by nature social and find meanings in relationships and humane treatment of people. This is not

(7:25) nihilism which is a belief in nothing or hedonism which is concerned only with personal pleasure but rather a way to

(7:31) work towards overall life health and satisfaction. Although it is healthy to seek happiness and pleasure in our

(7:37) lives, there must be some responsibility to the society in which one lives. It's hard to be well in a completely sick

(7:44) society and conversely it's impossible for the society to be healthy if the people in the society are oppressed and

(7:50) have no uh freedom to express themselves and live according to their beliefs. Um

(7:57) uh uh secularly humans believe that a person's religious beliefs do not give them the authority to oppress anyone

(8:02) else just as someone else's religious beliefs give give them no authority to oppress yours. So how do we tell if

(8:10) something is doing harm? Well, sexually humanists evaluate it in the same way we can observe stars or perform studies on

(8:17) the ocean. Science for the last few hundred years has been the best methodology for discovering of what is

(8:22) fact and fiction. We know science is capable of this as it produced the most accurate representation of the world

(8:29) around us that we can use to do everything from make planes fly to allow people like like Andrew and I on the

(8:34) other side of the world to communicate. Now you may think that a god created science or that's the only way to

(8:40) science and we can't agree on that. However, everyone uses the products of science in their lives daily. So I hope

(8:46) we can agree on its effectiveness and consistency. Now the problem with science is it doesn't tell us how to use

(8:52) it or which is the right or wrong way to use it. That's what moral systems are for. Um there's a wide array of needs

(8:59) that humans uh uh have uh that we have to address in order to be well. Uh of

(9:04) course there's physical health alongside food, water, shelter. There's a need for safety and security. Um a human in

(9:10) constant abject fear or threat is rarely well and can lead to things like PSD like you know veterans do to can attest

(9:17) to. Um, as I mentioned earlier, humans are social animals, meaning we do need connection and community in order to be

(9:23) well. Um, physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists can evaluate and study what makes a human both physically and

(9:31) mentally healthy. We can also analyze human well-being with sociology, making statistical

(9:37) analysis and giving a large enough sampling size accurately model happiness on a country or even a global scale. Do

(9:44) note that greatest happiness or the happiness used in this context is not just about fleeting joy or pleasure. It

(9:51) it's not like what you get happy when you won something or you're happy. That's a fleeting emotion. Um it it's

(9:57) talking about overall life contentment or satisfaction rather than temporary happiness. Uh now that we've covered

(10:02) secular humanism, I want to talk about why it's better than Christianity for society. Um and is this an ethical uh

(10:10) system that is subjective? It's not so this system is not really a subjective moral system and rather it's an

(10:16) intersubjective ethical system. Now what does that mean? Um there's so when we

(10:21) choose that we care about human well-being there's nothing objective to say that you have to care about humans

(10:27) or even your own well-being. But if you do care about your friends, family, people in your country or people

(10:32) generally we can make up some objective statements kind of objective statements about what will lead us towards that

(10:39) human well-being and what will lead us away. For instance, cutting off someone's head will lead them away from human well-being while providing them

(10:45) with health care will help their human well-being. And that's not really a subjective p perspective. Only the

(10:52) stance that that human well-being is important is. Um secular humanism promotes if you do care about other

(10:59) people, then secular humanism is a way to live a happy and healthy life with no gods, no prayer, no belief, and no

(11:06) dogma. So here are briefly some problems with Christianity. I should point out that these are not exhaustive and the

(11:12) problems with Christianity are varied and massive. Uh crusades, inquisitions, the genocide of the Cathars in 1209. Uh

(11:19) the recent and disgusting sexual misconduct by not only the Roman Catholic Church but many other

(11:24) denominations. Witch hunts not only in the past but including the killing and torture of women that has happened in

(11:30) Africa recently due to evangelical promotion of of witch hunting places like Kenya and Nigeria. uh doctrine of

(11:37) discovery and the forced abduction and conversion of native peoples. I could go

(11:42) on and on and on, but the transgressions of Christianity are too numerous to list in full. Instead, I'll stick to a few

(11:49) things that make secular humanism superior to Christianity, apart from the insane amount of atrocities that have

(11:55) happened throughout the years. Uh Christianity has no way to evaluate the future of human technology and

(12:01) development. it is stuck in the past and anyone wanting to evaluate something like automation or AI must go through

(12:07) the Bible and find something vague that may or may not support or condemn the thing that they're talking about. Um,

(12:14) this leads to vast disagreements on this verse or that verse. How interpretation can be jammed into whatever situation

(12:20) you were trying to dis decide. Since secular humanism does not rely on millennium's old text, we can just

(12:26) evaluate whether it is good for human well-being or bad for human well-being. As we learn more and find out if

(12:32) something is not good for human well-being, then secular humanists can change position in alignment with what

(12:37) we discover about it, making it responsible for any future needs, which is something that religious

(12:42) fundamentalists have a very hard time doing. Once they've decided something is good and bad, it rarely rarely changes.

(12:50) Um, so I want to focus on this problem with Christianity. Dogma is a claim that your beliefs are true and not able to be

(12:55) challenged or questioned in any way. As we have seen throughout the history of Christianity, this leads to Christians

(13:00) crying heresy and attempting to force their set of dogmatic beliefs on other denominations, religions, and other

(13:06) members of society. The problem is that the other religions and members of society will not accept their claim of

(13:12) authority. Take for example the great schism of 1054 between the east and west churches nearly a thousand years later

(13:19) and they only just lift the formal excommunication of each other in 1965.

(13:25) Now, even now, full communion and reconciliation has not been restored

(13:30) almost a millennium later and still ongoing.

(13:35) Um, so I know this title is contentious and it is a bit of a jab, but Christianity does preach and tell people

(13:41) to prepare for and embrace a doomsday scenario. This is a problem because there's little motivation to address

(13:48) society's ills if one does not think there'll be a society to fix. As an atheist, I don't think there is any

(13:53) doomsday coming. And it horrifies me that some would look forward to the destruction of our world. Why preserve

(14:00) the environment? Why make society better? Why work towards a better future if you don't think there's a future? So,

(14:06) this is a real problem that the apocalypse is coming. Prepare yourselves

(14:12) instead of making the world a better place. Um, and another question that I really

(14:17) want to ask and I really want an answer to is where does the morality from come from with a theist? Does it come from

(14:23) the Bible? Does it come from directly from God? Does it come from somewhere else? Does God just decide what morality

(14:31) is? If so, it's still an objective morality. It depends on the sorry, a subjective

(14:37) morality. It depends on the stance of God and what would change a god from just changing their mind. And if it

(14:42) doesn't, you're kicking the can down the road. If it doesn't, where does morality come from? Does God source it from

(14:48) somewhere? Does it come from some other place? Um, this this is sort of a question that's known as the Uifro

(14:54) dilemma. And it's a very pertinent question to this debate. Where where is this actually coming from? Um, so why

(15:01) humanism? So, I really want to talk about why humans have to cooperate and exercise what's called pro-social

(15:06) behavior, basically social productive behavior between people. The more we

(15:12) learn about where we are, the more obvious it seems that we're in a bit of a precarious position. Now, you you may

(15:19) or may not agree, but us secular humanists do not believe that any supernatural being is coming to save us.

(15:26) No, God is going to take us to anything better. So understand that from my perspective. Secular humanists believe

(15:32) that it's up to humans and humans alone to ensure our survival on this planet or we can stupidly cause our species to go

(15:39) extinct. We we don't know what it will take to nurture humanity on this what I

(15:44) believe is an incredibly important journey. But it is possible that we may need every one of us working together

(15:50) for the benefit of all in order to survive. The simple fact is that a secular humanism seeks to have a

(15:56) flourishing happy societies where all people are treated well while Christianity wants to force society to

(16:02) benefit its particular dogma dogma while marginalizing persecuting and even exterminating those do those that don't

(16:09) believe the same thing they do in order to secure their future with their

(16:14) imaginary friend. This should tell you everything you need to know about which

(16:20) system is better for society. Thank you. Oh, uh just just an aside,

(16:26) just uh quickly at the end tail end of this, I do want to say that um there was an act repealed that sort of uh recently

(16:32) in the US that took away the ability for uh the churches can now donate money to

(16:37) political causes. And um you might be happy about that if you're a theist, but uh keep in mind um the Mormons sort of

(16:45) uh um are the richest denomination or you know religion by far with something

(16:51) like 265 billion in wealth. Um the next you know the Catholic Church for

(16:56) instance is like about a tenth of that in wealth. So you know maybe that isn't

(17:01) as great as it possibly could be depending on whether you're a Mormon. But I want to thank you for listening.

(17:07) Thank you for your time and I'll pass it back to James. Thank you very much for that opening

(17:13) Mark. And with that, we're going to jump into Andrew's opening statement as well. But first, I want to do a couple of

(17:19) quick housekeeping things. First, folks, if it's your first time here at Modern Day Debate, I'm your host, Dr. James Coons. We're a fully neutral debate

(17:26) platform hosting debates on science, religion, and politics. And we have a couple of special events coming up. At

(17:33) the bottom right of your screen, you can see an event. In particular, David Wood

(17:38) and Daniel Hokikashu will collide for two debates that are free for the public. In Youngstown, Ohio, that's at

(17:45) the Seek and Share Truth Apologetics Conference. They've asked us to collaborate with them and we gladly are.

(17:51) I'll be there moderating in person. So, come on out and meet David and Daniel, myself. We'd be thrilled to see you

(17:57) there. That's linked in the description box below. RSVP. They just want to have an idea of how many people they can get

(18:03) in before they have to cap it. Also got a lot going on. Want to say thank

(18:08) you guys for your support. We are very excited as our outnumbered series first starring Andrew. As you've seen a lot of

(18:15) our uploads lately have had Andrew in the kind of five on five format. The

(18:20) next one's going to be with Destiny. If you are in the Los Angeles area,

(18:26) let us know. email modernday debategmail.com as you can see at the bottom right of your screen. That's coming up on August

(18:33) 5th. So that's coming quick. Shoot me an email at moderndaydebategmail.com. You can debate Destiny in person in that

(18:39) same format that you've seen Andrew in. And with that, we're going to kick it into Andrew's opening statement. Thanks

(18:45) for being with us, Andrew. The floor is all yours. Well, first I would like to take a

(18:51) second to apologize to my opponent. uh the last debate, I could not be bothered to get out of bed to debate with

(18:57) somebody of his limited social qualities. Uh with that, I'd like to dive right in to my opening statement.

(19:05) Uh Mark's ideas are actually pretty hilarious. Um along with the ideas of

(19:12) secular humanism itself, Mark defines secular humanism as a philosophy, a

(19:18) belief system or a life stance that prioritizes human reason, secular ethics and philosophical naturalism that

(19:25) explicitly rejects religious dogma. supernaturalism and

(19:31) these foundations for morality, decisionmaking. Instead, morals and ethics are derived

(19:37) from understanding humanity's place within the natural world, guided by the

(19:42) principles which are outlined in the Amsterdam Declaration. An excerpt from the 2022 Amsterdam

(19:49) Declaration. We affirm the worth and dignity of the individual and the right

(19:55) of every human to the greatest possible freedoms and fullest possible development compatible with the rights

(20:02) of others. To these ends, we support peace, democracy, the rule of law, and

(20:07) universal legal human rights. They should just say a bunch of dumb asses

(20:12) came up with a bunch of madeup stupid nonsense to sound smart, but ended up saying a bunch of [ __ ] [ __ ] that makes no sense. To start with, Humanism,

(20:20) like most pro-Enlightenment stupidity, isn't saying anything. It literally doesn't tell us anything.

(20:26) Humanist International, where we get the Amsterdam Declaration, has a whole section on the LGBTQI

(20:32) IA triple hockey stick ZFB saying, "As we celebrate uh Pride Month, we

(20:39) underscore the fact that millions of LGBTQ plus a individuals cannot celebrate their identity this June. In

(20:46) 62 countries, same-sex relationships are illegal with several regressive recent

(20:51) developments in this domain, including Uganda, Iraq, Indonesia, seeing the outlawing or de facto outlining of

(20:57) same-sex relationships with harsh punishments. Yeah. So, what are you going to do about it?

(21:04) You going to whine while the Muslims chuck people off buildings who offend their delicate sensibilities? Mark, you

(21:09) ain't going to do [ __ ] Listen to this nonsense from the 2022 Humanist declaration. We accept that morality is

(21:17) inherent to the human condition, grounded in the ability of living things to suffer and flourish, motivated by the

(21:24) benefits of helping and not harming, enabled by reason and compassion, and needing no source outside of humanity.

(21:31) Perfect. So, as long as we persecute gay people because we decide instead of outsourcing it to this silly God

(21:38) character, what's the objection? Oh, Andrew, that causes suffering. Oh, yeah.

(21:43) Well, not after they're gone. You can't suffer anymore if we don't have to suffer looking at a bunch of [ __ ] humping humanists like Matt Dillah

(21:49) Hunty. I say that alleviates suffering. In fact, I'm going to go a step further.

(21:56) You see, Mark, I'm willing to see this whole God character may have just come out of the minds of men. Of course,

(22:03) since you believe morality is inherent to the human condition, this means that it was actually men's inherent morality,

(22:09) which led us to all those Christian sins you loathe so much. Slavery, genocide,

(22:15) oppression of women, the oppression of samesex love. That all came from humans, Mark, and

(22:23) their inherent morality, which applied to them based on the human condition and their environment. So, what can we glean

(22:30) from that? Well, we can glean that humans are dangerous [ __ ] critters, aren't they? If the environment they

(22:36) live in makes for such a wide birth between their ethical systems, then it sounds like we should get this [ __ ]

(22:42) under control and quick. I don't want animals who genocide each other, and sexually assault each other, enslave

(22:48) each other to vote in a democracy. What are you [ __ ] crazy?

(22:53) We need to encircle these dangerous beasts with wardens who have high power weapons and keep their asses under

(22:58) control, not give them a bunch of freedom. Look at what they do with it. Mark will even tell you in his own

(23:04) opening statement, which he did. What they do? They murder and rape and pillage and torture and marry underage

(23:11) children. They burn people alive. They press them to death. But we can't blame God, can we, Mark? After all, he's a

(23:18) pure fantasy. We can only blame the inherent human condition of morality.

(23:23) That's right. The evil god dark creature doesn't even exist, Mark. Humans made

(23:29) them up to reflect their own morality inherent to them according to you.

(23:34) And Mark wants to suddenly trust these crazy [ __ ] to run [ __ ] in society collectively. Brilliant plan, Mark. I've

(23:41) heard some irrational crazy [ __ ] before, but that really takes the cake. insert

(23:47) Christians in Christian ethics, limiting autonomy for duty and self-sacrifice as opposed to do whatever makes you feel

(23:53) good and democracy is based. Yuck. Yuck. What's hilarious about his system is all

(23:58) Christians actually need to do is just give a simple harm to good ratio and the

(24:04) humanist scum will have to bow their heads to our authority for the purpose of human flourishing. Well, I'm prepared

(24:11) to do that in this debate, especially since I'll show you there isn't a single accusation Mark can accuse my system of

(24:16) that his isn't guilty of. Not one. Oh, says Mark. Which denomination's

(24:22) going to run things? Well, gee, Mark, glad the framers thought of that. But on top of that, the same question applies

(24:27) to you. Which denomination of humanist gets to run things? As their beliefs aren't uniform either. Christians can't

(24:32) prove their God is real. So what? Mark can't prove humanism is real or its

(24:38) principles. Christians will use force. What the [ __ ] do you think humanists are going to enforce their will in society

(24:43) with Mark? Rainbow shooting confetti slingshots or masked men with helmets and guns. What's so great about Mark's

(24:50) society that he wants anyway? It's just some stupid ad mixture of enlightenment and libertarian values which gives us

(24:56) some nebulous don't do harm which is stupid on its face. You can't even run a society without doing harm. Every policy

(25:04) will prioritize one group over another, exploiting one for another. All of them. Mark will say, "Well, where we can, we

(25:10) should minimize that." Yeah, no [ __ ] Mark. Christians never thought of that. Luckily, we have 1950 homosexual

(25:17) humanists to guide society into our utopia of reason values using humans have inherent moral something or

(25:23) another. In short, Marxism is totally unhelpful. It gives us nebulous guiding

(25:29) principles, says nothing about the justification of particulars, and can't give us any basis to streamline for an

(25:35) ought. It just points out human beings are super dangerous and need to be controlled. And so the best way to do

(25:41) that is making sure we control them the least amount we possibly can. [ __ ] brilliant. Hey everybody, did you know

(25:47) that all throughout human history, people have been genociding people and murdering and doing horrible things? Yeah. What should we do about that? Let

(25:54) them uh vote to legitimize the horrible things they do to each other. So we and then we'll have consensus that it's okay

(26:00) because they're inherently moral. Mark says Christians can't evaluate the future. And then he says,

(26:07) he says, "We can't cuz we may need to consult the Bible." For what? For moral

(26:13) odd what? You think Christians are incapable of using science? Did Did we Did we suddenly fail at the use of

(26:19) science? We have to consult the Bible for things like robot a robot and AI future. Or would we need to consult the

(26:25) Bible for the moral odds which revolve around these which have a little bit more to do than it just makes me feel

(26:31) good? Mark attacks our esquetology. He says, "Christians are worried that the apocalypse is coming, so prepare

(26:37) yourself." Uh, so does secularists. There's a whole Cold War. What the what the what the [ __ ] is he talking about?

(26:44) Does Mark think you shouldn't have emergency supplies and be prepared in case some some massive apocalyptic like

(26:50) event happen? Of course not. Secularists do the exact same thing. Same exact thing. Oh, do we need to be prepared,

(26:57) Mark, for the end times that nobody knows when it's going to come. So we just constantly are keeping ourselves prepared for inevitable disaster which

(27:04) may come. Same exact thing you would prescribe. There's literally nothing here that you could use that you could

(27:09) attack the society that I want that you will not be guilty of. Not a single thing, Mark. Churches, he says, well,

(27:16) they can donate to political causes and we should be really cautious because Mormons, well, they can now vote, too,

(27:22) and they have a lot of money. Well, that's true, Mark. The good news is is that they're pretty [ __ ] based. And

(27:27) when they vote, woo, it's great. They vote against abortion. They vote against female suffrage. They vote for all kinds

(27:35) of awesome stuff that I really like. Mark, I'm okay with that. I'm okay with Mormons now having the power to put

(27:42) pressure on politicians to end abortion in Utah, to end LGBTQ marriages. I'm

(27:48) fine with that, Mark. And so are the Catholics. And so are the Orthodox. And so are all of them. All of them are fine

(27:53) with that, Mark. It's okay. We'll be all right. I promise. And with that, I will yield whatever is left of my time so

(28:00) that we can get into the debate proper. Thank you very much for that opening. We

(28:06) are going to jump into the open dialogue. Folks, want to let you know we have many things we're excited about. As I had mentioned, one in particular, we

(28:12) are 82% of the way for our camera lens fundraiser. So, I have just put in the

(28:18) chat and we'll pin it right now the link for our GoFundMe. These are going to be used for, as you saw earlier, we are

(28:24) hosting Andrew in Chicago August 8th for an in-person fiveon-one debate like

(28:30) you've seen released here on the channel before. That's why we are getting these lenses is that we are going to use them

(28:35) so many times. It's like, hey, it just makes more sense to buy them rather than rent them. So, join us in our mission to

(28:42) bring more in-person debates back. With that, we're going to jump into the

(28:48) open dialogue. Mark and Andrew, the floor is all yours. Yeah, I um I think that sort of um

(28:55) trying to use slavery against um um secularly humanism very strange since your your Bible has in it sort of where

(29:02) um rules for owning slaves, beating slaves, that kind of stuff. So I think that sort of trying to leverage

(29:09) is a problem. Yeah. What's wrong with it? Um can you can you justify why the Bible has slavery in it?

(29:14) What does that have to do with the debate? We're talking about whether or not secular ethics or Christian ethics are better for society. Why do I need to

(29:21) justify anything that the Bible says? All I need to do is give you a metric for good or not good by your standard and why.

(29:27) So you don't think the Bible you don't think the Bible outlines how people ought to behave.

(29:32) Oh, sure. I think so. But so what we're talking about if it's how they ought to behave,

(29:40) then slavery is something that people ought to do. Then you need to tell me tell me right now how Christian ethics

(29:46) has affected slavery in in society. Mark, well there's been a mixed result. I mean

(29:53) the world the abolitionists a lot of the abolitionists were uh uh uh uh Christian

(30:00) but um a lot of the say the KKK were also Christians weren't they?

(30:05) Oh so oh well suddenly the KKK they don't count anymore. So the crosses they were

(30:12) burning, they weren't Christian crosses. They were non-Christian crosses. I bet they were, weren't they? Oh, that's so crazy. I get Well, the

(30:18) communists were secularists, Mark. So therefore, you're guilty of everything communists have done, right?

(30:25) What do you mean? I'm not a communist. I know, Mark. You're not a communist. You can't lay what the KKK did cuz they

(30:31) were also Christians or identified as Christians, the feet of Christians. So only the good things count. So this

(30:37) is only good fallacy. It's basically when you only count the positives and

(30:42) ignore all the negatives some of the atrocities that Christianity has done over the years. Do you want to

(30:49) go into some of the atrocities? Yes. Okay. Doctrine of discovery. Doctrine of discovery. Let's talk about

(30:54) this of discovery. The invasion of every single new world slaughtering anybody

(31:00) that is a deal and I get to say we don't get anywhere. Just

(31:05) Well, you're interrupting me as well. I'm just I'm trying to make a deal with you. Pardon my interruption. Okay. So, I

(31:10) think Andrew says he's willing to humor what you'd like to go into, Mark. But I think he says he's there's some sort of

(31:15) deal he wants to make. Let's hear him out and then we'll go forward, Mark, with what exactly you had. So, let me

(31:21) just unmute you guys. Okay, Andrew, go ahead.

(31:27) Oh, you have to press un. Okay. So, anyway, uh so here I'll make a

(31:33) deal with you. You can we'll go one for one. You can point out whatever uh Christian atrocity you want and I'll

(31:38) point out a secularist atrocity. I promise I'll take secular humanist. No, just secular.

(31:43) Secular humanist. Well, I don't understand. So, is this debate Christianity versus

(31:49) secularism? Oh, you're Oh, you're right. Okay. So, all the secularists have to do is believe the same stuff as is in the

(31:55) secular humanist. No, no. Secular humanism is what we're talking about.

(32:00) Well, what is a secular humanist? Presumably somebody who believes in secular humanism.

(32:05) Well, I'll h I'll happily discuss the the the things that secularists have done if we also include any theists

(32:11) whatsoever. Yeah, sure. Let's do it.

(32:17) Ready? Okay. Yeah. Go ahead. What are your criticisms? Okay. So, the Muslims, the killing

(32:23) people, 9/11. Mhm. Well, no, no, I thought you were talking about Christians here. Theist Christians, right?

(32:29) I said just going to put it all at the level. So then any secularist understand theist is Andrew. Do you know what theist is?

(32:36) Tell me. Use small words. It's somebody that believes in a personal god. Oh okay. Got it. Okay. Well now I

(32:42) understand what a theist is Mark. I I didn't know before. Thank you for elucidating me. So you agree to discuss theists and now

(32:49) discuss theist. Well I mis I misheard what you said Mark. But if it is the case we'll stick to Christians then. We'll stick to the

(32:55) subject which you're Christian. Christianity versus Christian.

(33:01) Are you at the wrong debate, Andrew? Is every Christian the same though? Okay. What was the question, Andrew?

(33:06) Is every Christian the same or they're the They are Christian.

(33:11) Are they all the same though? Cuz you say all secularists are not the same, right? Are all secular humanists the same?

(33:18) Yeah. And you would agree that that's not the case. They are. Do they have a standard set of beliefs?

(33:24) No, they don't. No, they don't. Secondary humanists don't even have a standard set of beliefs, Mark.

(33:31) So, you went through, by the way, the Amsterdam Declaration, which is an old document. We're up to sort of humanist

(33:37) manifesto 3, which you probably know. You just had to go way back to an old document to try and get it. So, I think

(33:42) it's fair I go back to the old No, I use 2022, but um I'm using 2022 Amsterdam

(33:48) 2022. That's the most recent one. Yeah. But is that the most recent one, Mark?

(33:54) What do you mean? the 2022 uh New Amsterdam um decoration.

(34:00) I'm using I'm using Humanist Manifesto 3. Yeah, but I'm using both.

(34:05) Yeah. So, don't use both. I use the Manifesto 3. I mean, I can go back to

(34:11) the um Old Testament. That's fine. So, you're saying that you're sort of saying we're doing Christianity versus secular

(34:16) humanism, and now you're saying, well, I'll go one for one for Christianity versus secularism in general.

(34:22) Yeah. But do you know why? Can I explain? You want me to stick to your denomination maybe? What's your denomination?

(34:27) Orthodox. Give me all ouries. Yeah. Oh, okay. So, how about in 2005 when

(34:32) there was sex and fraud in in Greece in the Orthodox church with, you know, a 91year-old bishop doing pedophilia, for

(34:40) instance. There was mass corruption. They stole $4 million from the church.

(34:46) They absolutely absolutely corrupt. Um, you know, they they were stealing

(34:52) antiquities. Yeah. This is your church. Okay. Do you want me to respond authority from again?

(34:57) Well, can you let me respond at least to the criticism or No. Okay. So, let's start with this. Can we go through all

(35:03) of the secular run public schools and take a look at all their sex scandals and how they're hundred times greater than that of the Catholic Church and 300

(35:09) times greater than that of any Orthodox denomination you can point to? Can we do that first? Humanism. Oh, it's secular humanist. Secular

(35:16) humanist. No. Can I respond? Can I respond? Can I respond? Can I Can

(35:21) I finish the question? No. No. You're just bleeding. I'm not allowed to finish a child. That's all. I'm trying to finish the question, Mark.

(35:27) It's not a question. You ask me the question. You want to go when I'm done asking it. When I'm done asking, okay, go for it. Finish asking. I don't

(35:33) think this is. So, can you can you tell me how it is that the secular run schools? And yes,

(35:39) guess what? I could show you all the doctrines which now public schools use which are adapted from the secular

(35:46) humanist. The secular humanist manifesto. Yes. that much of that is

(35:51) informing public school systems who are hiring teachers who are [ __ ] their students. Mark, secularism has not

(35:57) preventing that. Have you finished your question or are you just going to keep going? I'm when I'm done then you can the

(36:02) difference between it the difference very the difference between us the difference between it is that these

(36:09) organizations the institutions like the Orthodox Church covered up and secreted away their bishops and these pedophiles

(36:15) in order to protect them. All of these institutions did that while the public schools turned them into the police and

(36:21) there was some repercussions. Do you know what the Orthodox Church did when they they uh found this out? They said,

(36:27) "Oh, it's a it's a shame upon the Cassic and we're really really sorry, but nothing really happened to them while

(36:32) these we're actually doing something about it." Yes, these problems are over

(36:37) a long, but at least our institutions don't willingly cover up and persist in aiding

(36:45) these horrible, terrible people in what they're doing and organize for them to

(36:51) to continue to do it because they they want to protect their church above all

(36:57) else, above the children, above the people, above the country, above the laws. They just care about their church

(37:03) because if they lose the trust in God, then oh, what are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?

(37:08) Is it my turn to respond now? Sure. And you notice I didn't interrupt you? Could you not do that for me?

(37:15) Well, when you stop interrupting me, I'll stop. I I didn't interrupt you even once. I let you go through that whole You've been interrupting me all debate.

(37:21) Did I interrupt you that time? No. Okay. So then, so then So then don't interrupt me.

(37:26) I knew there was hope for you. I knew I knew it. Hope I know there's no hope for your head, Bill. So anyway, what what I

(37:32) was getting George and this was this was really simple, right? Very simple.

(37:37) Doesn't matter. The public school system also has covered up many many sex

(37:43) scandals. Uh in fact, it's gone to an administration level where administrations have covered them up as

(37:48) well. I can give you literally hundreds of examples of this from the even from the preschool level up, right, where

(37:55) these types of coverups have happened. Uh some of these publicly funded, some of these not. Most of them are. Not only

(38:01) that, Mark, but here's something that's really important that you're not touching on because you guys are such [ __ ] liars. Do you think that it's

(38:08) because that these places are churches that they just so happen to breed uh uh

(38:14) PDFs or do you think that it's more likely that PDFs tend to move where they have easy access towards children? So, I

(38:21) would never say it's because it's a public school run by secularists that's why you have so many PDFs because I'm

(38:27) not [ __ ] What I would say is, of course, there's tons of children. That's where you're going to find the most

(38:33) amount of predators. They're going to go where the prey is. That's going to happen in churches just like it happens in all public arenas where there's

(38:39) children. Doesn't matter if it's secular or not secular. Secular humanism would not do anything to solve that problem,

(38:46) Mark. And if it would, tell me what it is. Um, it it's secular humanism. And I must

(38:52) ad I must point out that even though even though schools you know they do

(38:58) have uh uh secular principles they're also a lot of religious people in them and there's also a lot of religious

(39:04) people that are actually doing this. It isn't just hey all of these schools are all run by secular humanists so

(39:11) everything they do no that's complete bull crap that's absolute crap. um that it is these institutions where they at

(39:17) the very top have hidden these priests and that's the problem. I'm not saying that people that people Yeah, you're

(39:24) interrupting again that people haven't institutions but generally they'll be given to the police and we will

(39:31) prosecute and jail them and then the um churches though they actually just move

(39:37) them around so they can they can abuse more children. Um, this is something that, you know, Andrew wants to put up

(39:43) against being against secular humanism. Well, what what about all of the uh um atrocities, crusades? Um, didn't the

(39:50) Can we do one point at a time? Well, I would like to get through the rest of I'd like to get through the rest of this

(39:55) point with the supposed sexual abuse. Well, I I know you're obsessed with this

(40:00) kind of thing with sex and sexuality and stuff. I know you're obsessed with it, but I I'm just obsessed with doing one point

(40:06) at a time. Can we just finish the point, though? We can finish the point. Sure. Okay. Great.

(40:11) I just don't want the entire debate talking about I'm not here to adhere to your preferences, Mark. The thing is I do

(40:18) have to ask you though, what would secular humanism do that would correct

(40:23) the problem of PDF files going where childrens are so that they can molest them? Mark, what what what is your great

(40:28) solution to that? What is it? Yeah. So, secular humanism promotes this philosophy that you do not do harm. you

(40:36) do things in the people's best interests. Okay? And it isn't a a a philosophy like it isn't a religion like

(40:44) Christianity that says, "Hey, at the point of a gun, we'll make you do what we want." That's not what it's for. You don't want to use a gun to stop PDF

(40:51) files. Mark, was that too much force for you?

(40:56) I didn't say that. Oh, I I mean, that's what it sounded like. You sound like you were doing a little bit of PDF there.

(41:02) I don't know what you heard, but I said force people to follow Christianity. How is are all Christians pedophiles? That

(41:08) would be news to me. Well, how does how would that even follow, Mark? Well, I said I said force people to

(41:15) just to be clear. PDF files. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, sorry, James. I I you know, I didn't That's all right. No problem.

(41:20) Um, okay. So, anyway, how are you going to hang on? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you just if you just let me talk. What I

(41:26) said is that that it doesn't force people to follow it like Christianity does. Okay. And then you went on to oh

(41:33) oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh it you know we're solving the problem. How does it solve the problem to be PDF? How does it solve the problem?

(41:39) How does it solve the problem? It promotes a philosophy of treating people well without forcing them and

(41:45) having sexual repression so these priests aren't going out and you know I believe the Orthodox church they're

(41:52) forced to be celibate. Correct. No, we like our priests married Mark.

(41:57) You like your priests married? Uhhuh. Yeah, we do. Well, you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

(42:03) talking about. Again, Mark, that's that's always funny. But here's the thing that's so funny about this. You think that it's sexual oppression that

(42:11) causes people to be PDFs? Does the science back that up, Mark? Um, what about the bishops?

(42:18) What about him? Bishop celibate. What in orthodoxy?

(42:24) Mhm. What does it have to do with anything? You're You said the priest. The priest. Do you know do you know what the

(42:30) distinction is between a priest and a bishop? But Mark, you didn't answer the question.

(42:35) Yeah, you asked me a question. The bishops have a bigger hat. That That's the distinction. Yeah.

(42:40) Okay. But so anyway, Mark, how does secular humanism account or solve the problem of PDF files going where there's

(42:47) children? Mark, how does it do that? I'm sorry. Are you thinking that having

(42:53) a moral system is going to solve a problem rather than laws, legislation? Is that what you're trying to inform?

(42:58) If you're trying to impose it on society because you're telling me it's better for society, I assume it has prescriptions for problems, right?

(43:04) See, this is this is this is a fundamental problem. It doesn't have anycriptions. People who are religious, they think that we're imposing it on

(43:11) society that we're going to push it on society like the Christians do. And that's not what it's for. What it says

(43:17) that if you want to live well, if you want to live a healthy and and satisfactory life, it is one philosophy

(43:24) that you can follow that can help guide you to good outcomes for people. That's

(43:29) it. So, it's not going to make any prescriptions for society. It's not going to make any prescriptions. What are you talking

(43:35) about? That's what I'm asking you. Is it going to make any prescriptions for society? Secular humanist. WS are prescriptions.

(43:42) Yes, I agree with you. So, so secular humanists, if they're in charge and in

(43:47) authority are going to use secular humanism to make, right? Right. Okay. So, if they make, what's their

(43:54) particular ought? Remember I said you guys are really light on particulars. What would you actually do as secular humanists to solve the problem of

(44:01) children going or uh being prey to predators inside of public schools?

(44:06) Mark, what would you actually do about that? Uh yeah. Well, we need to address the root cause here and that is basically um

(44:14) why these people have those urges in the first place and you know treat them for what is obviously a sick sick disease

(44:21) and Christians don't do that right do they Christians I thought Christians took

(44:28) them around the church molest more children

(44:33) I'm going to help you with something here so Christians vote overwhelmingly for what's called chemical castration which 100% % solves the problem of

(44:40) recidivism in PDF files. It has a 90 some like 95% plus success rate in

(44:47) stopping recidivism. It's secularists and uh and leftists especially leftist

(44:52) secularists who are always like, "Oh, it's inhumane. How could you? Oh my god, how's that?" Yes, Christians actually

(44:59) want to do something about that problem, Mark. And it's Christians inside of these denominations, by the way, when it goes public, who crucify these priests

(45:06) just as much as the rest of the public does. So you just pretending that because you have these widespread

(45:12) organizations, they're massive organizations, Mark, just like public schools are. Of course, if you're going

(45:18) to have children there, you're going to have predators there. That's how that works. And guess what? Predators are

(45:23) going to try to cover that [ __ ] up, especially if they're in positions of authority, just like your political elite does in your country. Mark, you're

(45:30) what is it? Prince Andrew. Didn't Prince Andrew go off to a certain island somewhere? Okay. Didn't he go off to a

(45:36) certain island somewhere and then try to cover it up? Mark, this is great. You don't know where I'm from, do you?

(45:42) No, I have no idea. Your your your knowledge of geography is just as good as your hilarious. It's absolutely hilarious.

(45:48) Oh, you think are you going to out philosophize me, Mark? Yeah, probably. I I I would imagine

(45:54) that. I can't wait to see when you start to out philosophize me. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

(45:59) I'm I'm sure wait with baited breath. But where do your morals come from? Why Why would that matter? Why would

(46:06) that matter? We're talking about the effects on society. How where do you look for for your morals?

(46:11) Where are you getting them from? So So here's the thing. We're talking about the effects of Christianity on

(46:17) society. Can you tell me? No. Even if Christians I'm seeding Even if

(46:23) Christians are totally wrong and the whole [ __ ] is made up and out of their brains, it's still better for society than whatever you have.

(46:31) Yeah, Mark, where is your evidence of that? Yeah. So, here's my evidence of this. Yeah. Let's start with the secular nations not

(46:38) being able to reproduce themselves, Mark. And the more secularist a nation gets, the less likely they are to be

(46:43) able to reproduce themselves. Let's start with South Korea. Can you pull up Can you pull Yeah. So

(46:49) can wait. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. How do you have humans flourish if you don't have humans?

(46:55) You you just you can like just because the population isn't exploding doesn't mean people, you know, are not well or

(47:02) happy or living well. What makes you think population

(47:08) tons of humans is actually um somehow people not being well? How did you get

(47:14) there? Mark, do you need to have humans for the humans to be well? Do you really think out of 8 billion humans on this planet

(47:20) that suddenly we're just all going to die out? Is that is that what happens in your fantasy? Mark, you need to look at the UN

(47:26) projections for the last 60 years. They have not hit any of their marks for the projection of population. They're

(47:32) predicting population collapse. Mark, they're predicting population collapse in almost every single Western nation,

(47:39) which can't reproduce itself in most of the Asian nations can't reproduce themselves. They're looking at China

(47:44) having half of the population in only 70 years. Mark, how's secularism helping us

(47:50) here with human flourishing? Can't even reproduce your own nations. Oh, this is hilarious. You think

(47:55) population decline is like civilization collapse. Is that really what you you

(48:01) think so? Yeah. Oh, it's doom and gloom. Oh dear. Oh dear. It's not like there's any other

(48:06) humans on the planet that could possibly possibly be flourishing at all. function

(48:13) of the planet is you mean like the religious ones who keep on populating Mark? Like those ones?

(48:19) Not necessarily. Oh, necessarily. Mark, I'll tell you what. Show me any secularist society

(48:24) which is their populations increasing domestically. Show me any all of the

(48:29) populations which increase are religious. You're right, Mark. There are going to be some humans who continue to

(48:35) populate. The religious ones.

(48:40) Yeah. I I don't I don't It's a non sequator. It's basically Oh, what's the nonsequity here? It's basically a slippery slope argument

(48:47) to say because there is a decline. It's not a slippery slope. This is empirical. Then then then um populations have to

(48:53) bottom out and we're all going to go extinct. I mean, will you listen to this nonsense? Even if even if that is the

(49:00) situation in a doomsday situation where oh society collapses because we can't

(49:07) procreate we can still make people there's IVF there's all kinds of things

(49:12) there's you know we can address these issues not the doom and doom thing I notice

(49:18) what I notice is that you will not answer any of my questions this isn't a god not real debate this is about the

(49:24) effect it all together Should I answer your question? Do you know what seeding the

(49:30) point of it is? Yeah. I just You are a delusional person. Sure. With this fantasy in your

(49:38) doom and gloom. The world is going to collapse into a Tell me because Tell me how I'm wrong, Mark. Tell me how

(49:44) because it's a slippery slope even goes down. We can address a lack of population. We do not need 8 9 10

(49:52) million people on this planet in order to keep a stable population.

(49:57) Okay, Mark, let's let's find out if this is true. You say that this is I'm making a slippery slope argument. Are you aware

(50:04) how the slippery slope fallacy works? Yes. It's when you point out a uh causal link to something and then project it

(50:11) down on a series of unlikely circumstances that you cannot possibly know in order to reach a conclusion that

(50:18) doesn't actually follow. Okay. Would you say it's a slippery slope argument if I say if people don't

(50:24) have sex, they're not going to have kids? What is that? Do Do you think that that's a

(50:30) slippery slope? No. No. Why not? Why not? Yeah.

(50:37) Well, um, aside from just a slight change I would make to that is people

(50:42) that do IVF can have kids without having sex, by the way. So, there is that. Well, no, not people, women. So, I guess

(50:49) I would make a slight caveat to that, too, Mark. But anyway, the point is, um, if people

(50:57) people don't have sex, we're not going to have kids. You agree that that's true, right? Yes. Do you agree that if we don't have

(51:04) kids, we're not going to have humans? If I agree we're not don't have kids,

(51:10) we're not going to have humans. Yes. Okay, great. So then if I point to a

(51:15) country and the country is not having kids, then the human supply is

(51:20) decreasing or increasing, Mark. Yeah. So um yeah, your idea that you No,

(51:27) I'm I'm doing your your argument here. Is people in that country are still having sex and people in that stunt

(51:33) country are still having kids? That's not what I asked you. I asked you is the population increasing in human

(51:38) supply or decreasing in human supply? It's decreasing. It's decreasing. And don't you want I'm

(51:43) I'm sorry, but the whole point of human flourishing, I would assume, is that you

(51:49) want the humans to flourish, right? Isn't that the whole point? When did I say human flourishing in that context?

(51:56) Well, what? So, you just Wait, I'm super confused. Help me out.

(52:03) Help me out, Mark. How do we have human flourishing if there's not humans?

(52:09) Well, hang on a second. I'm having problems with my browser.

(52:15) Yeah, you're having problems. All right. Yeah, I'm having problems with my Oh, there we go. Okay, gotcha. All right. Um

(52:21) so so human flourishing like you're basically saying people will not have kids but the funny thing is this that

(52:28) the people that will actually keep going are the people that do have kids because people are having kids in those countries. So your statement that hey

(52:35) people aren't having kids in those countries is not actually true. will still continue to have kids and then it

(52:41) will reach a stabilizing point because hey the descendants of people will having kids will have kids of their own

(52:48) and just because um you know people the population rate is declining like that

(52:54) means the population growth is declining doesn't mean it's going to have a collapse. You have not you have not

(53:00) linked that in. you have not tied that knot. And the statement that people in these countries aren't having kids is is

(53:07) ridiculous. As there is less people, there will be more opportunities for people to have larger families. It is an

(53:14) eb and flow. So, um you know, eventually it will reach a stabilizing point. We can have

(53:20) immigration. We can we can stabilize this. It's not a problem at all. Nobody thinks it's a problem except for these

(53:27) crazy doomsdayers. Man, that's so true. South Korea has in declared a demographic national

(53:34) emergency due to its extreme low birth rate. Those science denying doomsdayers. The country's fertility rate which

(53:40) measures the average number of children a woman is expected to have is the lowest in the world. The crisis has

(53:46) prompted the government to implement various measures aimed at boosting the birth rate and addressing the broader demographic challenge. Why? Because it's

(53:53) at 0.72 mark which means there's not going to be a South Korea in a 100 years at that rate. Mark, it won't be there.

(54:00) Mathematically, Mark, they they won't exist. Yeah. No, I Yeah. Yeah. No, it Why do

(54:06) you think that Maybe they'll be raptured? Maybe they'll be raptured. Why do you think that these South Koreans Mark, why do you think the South

(54:12) Koreans are such sciencey? The crisis The crisis isn't that they think that the population is suddenly

(54:18) going to vanish into the ether as Andrew is trying to suggest. The problem is an aging population and taking care of

(54:24) people that are older. If you don't have enough population, it's kind of harder to take care of people that are older.

(54:29) Luckily, we have sort of solutions for this automation technology things that Andrew doesn't robots are going to take

(54:34) care of. Explain how he gets his or at all. Why do I need to though? Yeah.

(54:40) Why do you need to? Yeah. Just get them from the same place you do. Me? It's a

(54:45) place you do. Me? Okay. So,

(54:50) you just I Andrew Wilson and the arbiter of all things which are moral on planet

(54:57) Earth. Me personally, Mark, you personally. Me personally. So, what is what is your goal um that

(55:03) you're working towards then? The elimination of all secular humanists.

(55:08) Really? Mhm. Okay. And can you tell me why that's wrong,

(55:14) Mark? Why is that wrong? Yeah. Where do you get your odds from? Because it's it's sort of, you know, it

(55:20) goes against what I want, which is human wellbeing. It goes against what you want. So, what you want goes against what I want. what

(55:27) I want goes against. I'm glad that we were able to clear that up, Mark. So, you philosophical, you philosophical

(55:33) jugger, not you. You would like to get rid of me and I say, "Hey, I want the best for all

(55:39) humans out there." Yeah. So, what makes you right? So, I think more humans will be on my side, but they can't just get rid of me.

(55:46) So, it's consensus, Mark. You don't think society is run by consensus? Well, whether it's run by consensus or

(55:52) not, you think you derive your moral odds from from consensus? No. Oh, well then where do you get them

(55:57) from, Mark? I I get them from an empathy and reciprocity and I get them from deciding

(56:04) that that and feeling that humans are important. And who gets to determine what that is? You.

(56:10) I do. Yeah. Oh, so then you're the ultimate arbiter of morality just like me. So you're basically saying that your

(56:17) morality is trying to eliminate me off the face of the earth. No, because I said my morality is everything

(56:24) that I want. And one of those things making sure your ideology is wiped off the face of the earth. Yeah. You said your goal is to eliminate

(56:31) secular humanists. That's what humanism. Eliminate secular humanism. Yeah. And

(56:37) how will you achieve this? If I say, "Hey, I'm going to change my belief." Here's what I would do. How are you

(56:42) going to do as the unilateral dictator of the world? I would outlaw secular humanism. And if

(56:47) you practiced it, I put you right in [ __ ] jail. Okay. So, you would take away my freedom

(56:53) because I disagree with you. Yeah. Why is that wrong though, Mark? Christian morals, ladies and gentlemen. Why is that wrong though, Mark? Why is

(56:59) that wrong? Why is that wrong? Yeah. Well, how would you like it if I basically said, "Well, I'm just going to

(57:04) throw all Christians in." Wait, don't you guys say this that that atheists just want to, you know, want to destroy

(57:10) Christianity and stuff? Yeah, but Mark, why is it actually wrong except that you're the arbiter of all that is moral?

(57:17) You're the arbiter of all that's moral. You I agree. So if I'm the arbiter of all that's moral, then if I'm going to imprison all secular humanists, that's

(57:24) moral, right? It's moral for you. It's not for me. Oh, so then who's the ultimate arbiter

(57:29) of morality for you? Who said there was ultimate arbiters? Well, there so there's just aer. Who's

(57:35) that? Well, it's interubjective. We kind of talk among ourselves and sort of say,

(57:41) hey, what do you want? What do you want? And most people do want to have and and

(57:47) understand that we live together and have to provide each other with some kind of functioning society. Because if

(57:54) you have a society where you go around throwing in prison just people that you

(57:59) don't like, you will basically have a society that is horrible to live in

(58:05) but functions fine. But is horrible to live in. That functions fine. Why is that wrong though? Except that you don't like it.

(58:11) Function fine. There's a whole bunch of secular societies out there that function fine. They can't even reproduce

(58:16) themselves. Mark Sweden and you know we could put them all on heroin and they

(58:21) would be much happier too. Mark, what what what do you mean? Yeah, I could just like you as the

(58:27) ultimate arbiter of all that is moral. You could just go like inject them with heroin. That would make them happier. Yeah. So, I can tell that you weren't

(58:32) paying attention to my introduction cuz greatest happiness principle is really talking about life satisfaction. And I

(58:38) don't know how you would be weird enough to argue that a person on heroin would have life satisfaction.

(58:44) Who gets to determine what what's life satisfaction? Well, there's a number of metrics as I

(58:50) showed you that we understand. Yeah. Who determined those metrics? Who determined them? What do you mean?

(58:55) Who determined those metrics? Well, the the sciences involved. Well, science science come up with

(59:02) metrics. Psychiatrists. We went through all the introduction. So it's basically people

(59:08) who studied it and you know basically studied it like we study anything and

(59:13) come up with hey what do people need to be happy? What do people need to be healthy? What do people need to function

(59:21) in society? What does society overall need to actually function well?

(59:26) And do you have to make presumptions for that Mark? Do I have to make presumptions

(59:31) that you could measure with science? Some of them. What? What do you mean? I I it's so

(59:36) well like for instance Mark is there can you put a needle in my arm take out my blood and measure my happiness?

(59:45) No. No. Why would you? So how how do you measure? Can a needle Can I put a needle in your

(59:52) arm, take out your blood and measure your cholesterol? Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's a good place to

(59:57) start, right? That's a measure of of healthiness, right? Yeah. But that's not a measure of of well-being. You you're just presuming

(1:00:03) that. You see how that's a supposition? really don't think being health physically healthy is a measure of that's a supposition Mark you're

(1:00:10) supposing that you see how you're supposeding that yeah you're

(1:00:15) think that if somebody is incredibly like ill they are well

(1:00:20) well what what does well mean what does you sound like Jordan Peterson mate

(1:00:26) just well mean what does does mean what does anything means

(1:00:31) up in the air who knows what anything means so like yes well-being is the

(1:00:37) physical and and psychological health of individuals and society um and that's

(1:00:43) basically it so the physical health yes okay so this is obviously not physically

(1:00:48) healthy right correct okay you're going to outlaw it

(1:00:54) uh no not necessarily do you smoke around your kids uh sometimes when I'm outside

(1:01:01) okay so you subject your kids to caragens Yeah. Well, you know, when they're playing in the street, cars subject them

(1:01:07) to way more carcinogens. But okay, Mark. Okay. So, lump lump chemicals on top of that. Yeah, that's that's

(1:01:12) Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure I'm sure, Mark, that when they're outside and I'm smoking a cigarette, their health is at risk. But here's the thing. Why aren't

(1:01:18) you out Why aren't you going to outlaw this? Where does it say in Christianity not to smoke around kids? It

(1:01:24) doesn't Where are you going when are you going to outlaw this? So, where are you getting that from? Getting what from?

(1:01:29) Don't smoke around your kids inside. I didn't say that. You said that, Mark. Can you tell me why you're not going to

(1:01:35) smoke around kids? Should you smoke around your kids inside? And sub I don't give a [ __ ] if people smoke in their house with their kids. I don't

(1:01:41) give a [ __ ] I don't give a [ __ ] Now, Mark, why aren't you going to outlaw

(1:01:46) cigarettes even though they're obviously not conducive to the well-being of people by your own metric? Because I don't believe in taking away

(1:01:52) people's choices if it only affects them. So, it's not just about the choice. They still get the choice whether to, you

(1:01:58) know, if they want to skydive and it's slightly higher, you know, higher risk than just, you know, driving everywhere,

(1:02:03) that's fine. If as long as they're not harming anybody else, that's okay.

(1:02:08) Actually, I think throw them in prison, you know, throw them in prison. That's obviously harming someone else.

(1:02:14) Can I make sure that I got this right? So, there's some things which you would not outlaw that you would give of people

(1:02:19) the freedom to do even though you would consider it harmful. Well, it's only for you. I mean, if you

(1:02:26) want to destroy your own health, I don't care. Got it. And you would make that kind of a un is that like a universal thing that

(1:02:33) that is that a universal you're saying? If you want to harm yourself, as long as you're not harming me, it's okay for you

(1:02:39) to do it. Well, I think there's there's sort of more and less harmful things. Like I

(1:02:44) mean with with cigarettes, some people smoke all their lives and they don't get cancer and they're totally Well, most of them don't. Most of them

(1:02:50) don't. Well, I mean, sure that some of them have problems with fitness, some of

(1:02:56) them have problems with some of them, emphyma, and some of them don't. Right. Yeah. Some of them don't. Now, Mark, I

(1:03:01) got to ask you then. If you had two twin brothers and they were in an incestuous relationship, would you stop that?

(1:03:07) Okay. There's a pivot to something completely. No, we're talking about moral odds. Mark, if there was two twin brothers who

(1:03:13) were in an incestuous rel Why can you demonstrate the harm? Uh, yeah. Because there is a power

(1:03:19) dynamic in families. There's a power dynamic in in non-incestuous relationships too, Mark.

(1:03:25) Sure. Yeah. Like in the workplace. Yeah. Like everywhere. So I don't understand. How can you outlaw just based on a power

(1:03:30) dynamic? There's a power dynamic between me and my wife. You going to outlaw that, too?

(1:03:36) What do you mean? I mean, there's a a lopsided power dynamic between me and my wife. Are you

(1:03:41) going to outlaw us being married, Mark? Well, maybe I I should if you smoke rounded kids. Yeah, but let's assume I

(1:03:49) didn't smoke around my kids. Would you outlaw that, Mark? If one of your kids got lung cancer from

(1:03:55) Yeah. Answer my [ __ ] question. Mark, stop pivoting. Mark, stop. I already did. You didn't answer it, Mark. You didn't

(1:04:00) answer it. Yeah, but there's a power imbalance between me and my wife. Why doesn't that Why does that get to be

(1:04:07) But an incestuous relationship does not get to be. When you're in a previous relationship where there is a power

(1:04:12) dynamic like for instance your boss and you at work there's already a relationship with a power imbalance

(1:04:18) there or between brother and sister. So if I meet a woman who's less problem if I meet a woman who's less financially

(1:04:24) able than me there's already a power dynamic there. No because do you think you have a do

(1:04:29) you hang on do you think you have a previous relationship with every woman? Only the ones you have previous

(1:04:34) relationships with? Yeah. So what you said is completely stupid. Oh, because I said if you have a previous

(1:04:41) relationship and I said if I had a previous relationship power dynamic Yeah.

(1:04:46) Yeah. So if I had a previous relationship with a woman who had way less financial means than me, right? That would put the power

(1:04:53) in my corner, right? So you would outlaw those marriages? That's not what I'm talking about. No,

(1:04:59) I don't understand how is it that you would outlaw an incestuous relationship based on power. You don't think there's

(1:05:05) a difference in relationship between some girl you've dated and your brother? Is that what you're saying?

(1:05:11) No, I'm saying if so, I think you need help. I think you need a lot of help. I'm saying that you need to demonstrate the imbalance and how normal imbalances

(1:05:18) in relationships somehow supersede that or don't supersede that. Explain it to me because it sounds very arbitrary. It

(1:05:25) sounds like you're just going to outlaw because you just don't like it, Mark. Well, it it's just that those like when

(1:05:31) you're in a family, you have a bonded relationship that is different than like

(1:05:39) do you see your your brother as in the same kind of relationship as your wife?

(1:05:44) I guess we need to get you help, Andrew. Do all of the uh posturing isn't

(1:05:49) answering the question. Answer the question. Uh we need to get you help because you see I'm worried about you and your

(1:05:54) brother. I want you to answer the question though, Mark. Um, do we need to send the police? Is this guy actually

(1:06:00) Yeah, call 1800 the 911. I couldn't answer a question during a debate, so I called you. Answer the [ __ ] question,

(1:06:06) Mark. Yeah, that's not out there. I already have. It's been What's the answer? Can you tell me what the answer was? Balance between

(1:06:11) Yeah, I know. But you haven't demonstrated it. A previous relationship that is a familial relationship. It is a power

(1:06:18) dynamic. Every relationship has power. How many people How many people

(1:06:24) do you know that are involved in incestuous relationships are well? Oh, you know what then, Mark?

(1:06:31) Answer the question, Andrew. Answer the question. I don't know any people in incestuous relationships. I would assume all of them are unwell. But the thing is all of

(1:06:38) them are unwell. Why should we think that what's your accounting for it though, Mark? What's your moral stance?

(1:06:45) Well, I'm trying to answer you. My moral stance is I go towards well-being. So if nobody who has ever had an incestuous

(1:06:52) relationship is well and we both know that they're not. Prove it. Prove it. Oh, you think they are?

(1:06:58) Yeah. I want you to give me the proof. Are you [ __ ] sicko? What is wrong with you? Can you prove it, Mark?

(1:07:03) Yes, we study these people. Say, Mark. Oh my god. Do I have to find a paper on

(1:07:09) the process relationships are harmful? You need to show me the moral objection

(1:07:14) to cuz I can find you a paper on how having an a relationship with two HIV people is harmful. You ain't going to

(1:07:20) outlaw that. You only arbitrarily want to necessarily harmful. You only and this is not necessarily

(1:07:26) harmful. What would the how could you demonstrate the harm? Let's say two brothers met each other. They didn't know each other for 30 years

(1:07:32) and then they met each other at work and they became attracted to each other and they started banging Mark.

(1:07:38) Is that is that is that okay for you? Just for your information, I'm going to put in the uh chat here a paper on why

(1:07:47) incest is actually harmful for people. So if my moral stance is that I go towards well-being and it's harmful for

(1:07:53) people that um yeah harmful for your children. Absolutely.

(1:07:59) These people can't have children. They can't have children. They can't have them.

(1:08:05) You're you're changing the subject. No, I'm not the How can you How can you ban that?

(1:08:11) ourselves all you want, but I do not want you harming. They are only harming themselves. You have a right.

(1:08:16) Who are they harming except themselves? Who? Who? What? The incest brothers. Who are they harming except themselves?

(1:08:23) They're harming each other and themselves. Yeah. No, they're Yeah. Only themselves consensually. Same thing as me. And you

(1:08:29) say, "When I do this, it's fine, but when they do that, it's not." Why? Yeah. Yeah. because they are not

(1:08:35) psychologically well. You do realize that we have exceptions for people who are in no state have a psychological

(1:08:41) issue. So they can't there is no listen you can demonstrate just information in

(1:08:48) the chat a a paper on this so you can read it if you want. Um you can you can

(1:08:55) peruse it at your leisure. You can peruse it at your leisure. So Mark, you're still not I want you to

(1:09:01) understand what you just said. You just said that if Andrew Wilson smokes, that's fine because it's only harming him. And if it harms him, that's his

(1:09:08) decision. He's a grown-up. He can make his own choice. When it comes, on the other hand, to two brothers engaging in

(1:09:15) incest, they're only harming themselves. They're grown men and can make their own choice. But you somehow say that you

(1:09:20) would outlaw it because it's harmful for them. Do do you smoke because you're psychologically unwell?

(1:09:27) Uh capable of making your own choice. Yeah. I mean, psychologically unwell, maybe. by your metrics probably maybe maybe we

(1:09:33) should put you away and get you some help if you can't you know if you are have psychological disorders that cause

(1:09:39) you to stop smoking would depression be a psychological order should be locked

(1:09:44) up for Mark what do you mean no no so so when you say psychologically

(1:09:49) unwell that doesn't really tell me much it could just be depression right

(1:09:55) wouldn't that be psychologically unwell I don't understand your point my point is is that it seems again that

(1:10:00) you're taking an arbitrary threshold breaker. You say me smokes cigarette that fine. Andrew damage himself that's

(1:10:08) fine. If he smokes fine if he if he smokes because he wants to. Yes, you're it's fine. You're not going to do any

(1:10:14) moved out, right? Okay. So confused between moral ought

(1:10:19) and legal systems and you have been all debated. Oh because something is immoral doesn't

(1:10:24) mean Oh, you're you're so right. Let's move to morality. Is it immoral for me to smoke a cigarette?

(1:10:30) Yeah. Is it immoral for me to eat a cheeseburger? Is it immoral to eat a cheeseburger? No.

(1:10:36) Is it immoral for me to eat a donut? You might be more morally virtuous if you have a better health than, you know,

(1:10:42) if you're if you're taking care of children, but how come it's immoral to smoke a cigarette but not eat a donut?

(1:10:48) Some things are moral necessities and some things are moral virtues. Some things, you know, if you kill somebody,

(1:10:55) obviously, you know, that's a moral necessity. Oh, I don't know. That doesn't seem that obvious. the um on the other hand

(1:11:00) there's moral virtues like if you give a lot of money to charity well that's a virtue but nobody you know it's not like

(1:11:06) you're immoral if you don't virtuous so we make this

(1:11:12) what do you mean I've been telling you about well-being all this time yeah I know but what actually makes it virtuous

(1:11:17) that you just think it's yeah like it's good for your wellbeing yeah yeah but lots of things it's good for others wellbeing giving to

(1:11:24) charity is good for others wellbeing sure so like but what if I went out and I fried ants with a magnifying glass

(1:11:31) because I thought it was really funny. Right. Is that Is that bad for my wellbeing? Well, I'm a secular humanist, not a

(1:11:37) secular antist. Mhm. Is that bad for my wellbeing though, Mark? Is it bad for your wellbeing? Not by

(1:11:44) itself. No. But, you know, if you do harm animals, smoking a cigarette. I don't know your life. You might be

(1:11:49) going out there harming animals. It may be a a I think it's fun. I shoot I shoot random

(1:11:55) things happen. Yeah. Okay. So maybe we should have you checked out for psychopathy.

(1:12:01) Psychopathy doesn't exist, Mark. Do you feel a sense of psychopathy doesn't exist, Mark?

(1:12:07) Who told you that? Show me Show it to me in any DSM ever.

(1:12:12) Psychopathy. Yeah, it does not exist. It's not an actual diagnosis, dummy.

(1:12:18) Psychopathy doesn't exist. It's not in the DSM anywhere. It is a um

(1:12:23) You just made it the [ __ ] up, Mark. You heard it in Hollywood and so you repeated it because you didn't know.

(1:12:29) Go ahead, Mark. It's a It's a symptom. No, it's not a symptom. There is no

(1:12:34) psych There's no such thing as psychopathy. You made it the [ __ ] up. Yeah, Mark, you made it up.

(1:12:45) You don't think? Oh [ __ ] it just clicked, didn't it? It just clicked, didn't it? Marky,

(1:12:51) what? What are you talking about? So, she So, wait. I'm sorry. You can diagnose people as sociopaths.

(1:12:59) Not me, but other people can. Yes. Can you show me that what that diagnosis is?

(1:13:04) Yeah. So, the actual um umbrella term that is in the DSM is antisocial personality

(1:13:10) because you can't diagnose people as psychopaths. Any of So, it is psychopathy is one of the sub,

(1:13:16) you know, it's not an official term, but it's description. It's not a term at all. You made it up to you made it up. Hey, hey, hey, hey,

(1:13:22) hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You made it up. Constantly made it up. Basically, it's antisocial personality

(1:13:28) disorder, which means what? Are are you joking? No.

(1:13:34) So that you know that antisocial personality disorder is in the DSM. Sure.

(1:13:39) But did I make that one up as well? Didn't say you did. I said what is it? So psychopathy.

(1:13:46) Okay. So it's, you know, a lack of empathy and remorse, manipulation, deceitfulness, egoentricity and

(1:13:52) grandeur. Um, there's a lot of different symptoms to it, but it's basically a lack of being able to empathize and

(1:14:01) understand people and your social peers around you. Okay, got it. So if it's the case, Mark,

(1:14:09) this antisocial umbrella, is it the case that in order for us to make these sort

(1:14:14) of diagnosis about if somebody's having antisocial behavior is because we look at the norms in society and say, "Okay,

(1:14:21) most people don't act like this, so therefore there's probably something wrong with you." Isn't that actually how we go about doing that, Mark, when it's

(1:14:28) all said and done? No. No. We understand neurology. So mirror neurons fire when you you look at

(1:14:35) other people and you see what they're doing. These mirror neurons are what causes empathy. You would be able to

(1:14:41) cure that when you actually see somebody else making a a feeling.

(1:14:46) Neurologist can't isolate manage it. You can you stop interrupting. So when when

(1:14:52) these I can't stop interrupting it. Basically, I do want to just interrupt because I

(1:14:57) think some folks have wondered if you're able to tie this in the weeds type point back to the main

(1:15:05) question of Christianity. I can do that very quickly. So, the reason I asked this question is because

(1:15:10) Mark is giving this uh arbitrary standard. Can I finish what I was saying before?

(1:15:17) He just No, he asked me to tie it in. Who did you ask to tie it in? I frankly either

(1:15:22) of you I think people are just losing foot on how it relates to the big question the title

(1:15:27) it's getting stuck in the weeds but the problem is that Andrew will not talk about where I tell you what let's do one minute

(1:15:33) let's do one minute responses otherwise I'm not interrupting you are no Mark you are too Mark

(1:15:38) it's fine no that is your mo that is your whatever you say yeah whatever you say Mark but

(1:15:44) anyway well then then why not do what whatever I say I won the debate look at

(1:15:50) We'll go with you didn't wear the best wig contest. You were wanting to explain how this

(1:15:55) particular question ties back to the title. Are you sure I have permission for Mark to do that? Mark, is that okay?

(1:16:01) Are you sure, Mark? My grant. Oh, Phil, how would I ever

(1:16:06) of Thank you. your benevolence. So, as I was pointing out, what we've established here so far in this debate is that if I

(1:16:13) say I'm the ultimate arbiter of morality, Mark's defenses, so is he. That's it. That's it. So all we're doing is applying our if if you take God out

(1:16:21) of the equation. Let's just say you take God completely out of the equation. Christians are actually [ __ ] delusional, right? We're just

(1:16:27) delusional. We believe in this God and if this God character and that's where we derive our moral odds from. Even if

(1:16:33) we're wrong, we can't be any more wrong than him. Because the truth of the matter is is that if it all really just

(1:16:39) is coming down to our preference, that's all it's coming down to for Mark 2. It's just his preference. He thinks that his

(1:16:44) preference is best for society. So I said, 'Okay, that's fair. If your preference and my preference is both

(1:16:49) what's best for society, but yours is better because of the outcomes. He said so because he's a utilitarian, right?

(1:16:54) Then how come you can't tell me why I can smoke a cigarette, can't smoke a cigarette or shouldn't smoke a

(1:17:00) cigarette, ought not smoke a cigarette because this is harmful to me. You wouldn't outlaw it, but you would outlaw

(1:17:05) uh samesex incestuous relationships. Why would that be the case? It makes no sense. One minute for Mark. Go ahead, Mark.

(1:17:11) Okay, so um I'm not the ultimate arbor of morality. I simply decide the metaethical goal that I will go towards

(1:17:18) which is human well-being. Apart from that, I don't get to decide what's good for humans and bad for humans. We really

(1:17:23) study it with Are you just going to interrupt still? We have to give Mark a chance. Go ahead, Mark. Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. Nice work. Um, so

(1:17:31) I I don't decide that. We study it with science and then determine what is good for people and what is bad for people. I'm not the ultimate arbiter at in any

(1:17:38) way, shape, or form. And we agree on this in society and it's sort of what our needs are are ubiquitous. I won't

(1:17:44) say they're universal, but most people believe that our needs are ubiquous and antisocial personality disorder is very

(1:17:49) destructive and in the DSM and is terrible for society. Most murderers do have some schizophrenia or antisocial

(1:17:55) personality disorder. Um so um this whole thing about like why I wouldn't outlide smoking. Well, no. I mean, if

(1:18:02) you need some freedom to be able to enjoy what you enjoy, if that's a risk to you, well, you might be happy to take

(1:18:07) on the risk. It doesn't mean I'm going to outlaw it. But if you're doing things to harm others, then yeah, I probably would. And we know the psychological

(1:18:14) harms of incest and having a familial relationship. So that is a problem. But

(1:18:19) you still won't tell me where your morals come from. You're just saying, "Hey, I go to myself," which I know is not the case because that would not make

(1:18:24) you a Christian. True, Andrew. I Yeah, I don't I don't understand. I can argue Christianity being good for

(1:18:30) society and not even be a Christian. Mark, did you know that I could? And so the thing is it's like none of that and

(1:18:36) where I draw my morality from. I was even willing in the best faith to see

(1:18:42) that Christians are delusional. And still the outcomes for society by following Christian ethics are better.

(1:18:47) And then I gave you an example which you still haven't answered to. You still haven't actually answered the question as to what is actually harmful between

(1:18:53) two consenting adults having sex with each other because they're related if they can't have children. You haven't answered that. You just give me this

(1:18:59) arbitrary like, well, because I think I think it causes them harm, but you think

(1:19:06) cigarettes cause harm, but I can smoke. That makes no sense. Also, your argument is circular. Anyway, Mark, I'm not the

(1:19:11) ultimate arbiter of morality. Some scientist somewhere that I imbue with my faith. They're the ultimate arbiters of

(1:19:17) morality. No, not really them. Consensus. No, not really consensus. The scientist. No, not really them.

(1:19:23) Ultimately, it comes down to me and my preferences and my preference for it's just this giant circle of you moving the

(1:19:30) goalpost over and over and over again. You have no accounting for anything that's moral. You're only looking at

(1:19:35) outcomes. Who cares if I'm [ __ ] delusional? Show me how Christian outcomes in society are worse than

(1:19:40) secular outcomes. Show me time Mark.

(1:19:46) Okay, so Christianity like he hasn't given any reasons really why Christianity is good for society besides

(1:19:51) this slippery slope of old. the population suddenly going to vanish out of existence. Um, the whole thing of some scientist somewhere, no, that's a

(1:19:57) mischaracterization. It's not some scientist somewhere. It is a body of knowledge that we built up over multiple

(1:20:03) generations. It is a as constant work to find out what is actually good and what is bad. And that's where Wilson goes,

(1:20:09) well, show me that something like antisocial disorder actually exists. Well, you know, there's people that

(1:20:14) study that and they're in disagreement. I'm sure that you know I I wouldn't imagine that that Wilson's got his PhD

(1:20:21) in psychology anytime soon at all. So um it's not some scientist somewhere. It's

(1:20:26) a consensus. They don't tell us what to do with that information that they produce. They produce all kinds of information. They don't tell us what to

(1:20:32) do. They don't tell us, hey, this is how the universe works and we should go to the moon. That is something we decide on top of that. And so secular humanists

(1:20:39) decide that we want a healthy, happy world. And that's what we decide. Um, Andrew Wilson says, "Well, he doesn't have to be a Christian to argue it." But

(1:20:46) he's not arguing for Christianity. He's just sort of saying, "Hey, I don't understand. I'm going to pretend not to

(1:20:51) understand what you're saying. I want to pretend and mischaracterize everything you're saying. Christianity because

(1:20:56) population, that's it. It's a ridiculous argument." And he hasn't actually given any reason to Christianity.

(1:21:02) Want to make Yeah. So, here's the thing. The argument here is very simple. whether or not Mark

(1:21:09) can demonstrate how secular humanism is actually better for society than

(1:21:14) Christian ethics. It's very simple. Here's what Mark has determined for you. Right? Andrew's delusional because he

(1:21:21) believes in this fictitious God character. Sure, I'll even see that the possibility of that is true. I'll just

(1:21:28) seed it for the purpose of the debate, which I've done multiple times. He keeps on asking me where I get the odd, but without God, just get it from me just

(1:21:34) like he does. He says it's not it doesn't come from him. But that's just moving the goalpost again. Do you see?

(1:21:39) He says, "No, no, no. I move it to the scientists because they're scientists. Therefore, they're imbued with me giving

(1:21:45) them the imbument of them being the arbiters of all of my morality." Right?

(1:21:51) Just like that God character for us, right? He's imbuing them with the authority to give him what he needs to

(1:21:57) make these uh ought claims for society. That's fair. You can even do that. I'm even willing to seed that. So, let's

(1:22:04) look at the effects of both. Well, I give you a great effect. The secularist nations can't reproduce themselves. You

(1:22:09) know what Mark said? We could just immigrate people in and replace the domestic population. Well, brilliant.

(1:22:14) Brilliant. I'm sure Mark that the Japanese would love it if and the South

(1:22:20) Koreans would love it if you would just immigrate in brand new populations so that these 2,000-year-old cultures go

(1:22:26) [ __ ] extinct because uh well, you know, uh it's all about human

(1:22:31) flourishing and this is just a doomsday scenario. doesn't address it. Gave him a state of emergency from South Korea.

(1:22:37) Give him the same state of emergency from Japan. This is, by the way, this the alarm bells have been ringing

(1:22:42) everywhere on this for the last 5 years. Won't address it at all. In fact, Mark even says it's the religious who are

(1:22:49) going to be the ones who who reproduce those and move out those societies. It's what's hilarious.

(1:22:55) Go ahead, Mark. Okay, so um you know, if you want to know why secular humanism better, we can

(1:23:01) just look at the things that um Andrew is promoting here. I mean, you don't have a fear of hell. You don't have religious trauma, which is a big deal.

(1:23:08) People have actually been traumatized by religion and having these things pushed on them. You wouldn't have high control

(1:23:14) religions like, for instance, the the Worldwide Church of God or or these these horrible cults that that actually,

(1:23:20) you know, people literally drink the Kool-Aid. I'm sure Wilson would be right in there. Um these religious fights

(1:23:26) between all of these denominations, you wouldn't have that either. Um so, you know, and he says, "Oh, we believe this

(1:23:31) God character." Wait, I thought you were delusional, Andrew. It suddenly changed. Yep. What happened to bearing false witness? Oh, it's out the door. Doesn't

(1:23:38) care. Yeah. No, it's all good. Um, the Japanese do have problems with overcrowding and housing. So, you know,

(1:23:43) yes, there is a problem. The crisis isn't what you think it is. It's it's caring for the elderly because we don't

(1:23:48) have enough people to do so. It's not actually what you think it is. And the whole idea that this will continue

(1:23:54) forever is just silly. It It's silly. The population is still growing. Um, so

(1:23:59) that's not even a characterization. And I might point out that without Christianity, we don't have this

(1:24:05) doomsday mentality of, oh, the world is gonna gonna end. And we'll do uh let's see, we had Mark

(1:24:12) had the very first word. We'll wrap up with this last one minute from Andrew. Then we're going to jump into the Q&A.

(1:24:17) So folks, if you happen to have questions, we've got a good number of them already, but otherwise submit them via super chat. Those are read first.

(1:24:23) Otherwise, standard chat with tagging modern day debate. Andrew, floor is all yours for one minute. That's so weird. So, oh, you know, this

(1:24:30) a fear of hell. Oh, so you mean that the things that you do in this life actually matter and you'll be held to account for

(1:24:37) them. And people fear that and so they avoid that by doing things that uh would land them in hell. Whereas opposed to

(1:24:44) your system, which is you just go to avoid so nothing you do here actually does matter. And so if you were to be a

(1:24:50) serial killer and kill a bunch of people, who cares? You just go into the void, right? How is that a better

(1:24:56) enforcement for society than hell? It's not. How is it a better enforcement for society to say there's no other worldly

(1:25:02) consequences to what you even do on this planet, Mark? How do you use hell as some type of entailment for bad because

(1:25:09) is operates as a social enforcement mechanism? That's stupid. He also says

(1:25:14) he oh the denominations will fight. They fight that secularist fight non-stop. Secular humanists fight with other

(1:25:21) secularists. Secular humanists fight with themselves constantly, right? They have councils who can't agree on anything. They fight constantly. You

(1:25:28) think that just because you if you were to remove religion tomorrow, you think that these people would just not fight

(1:25:34) with each other about what they thought? Give me a break. Well, that we're going to jump into the Q&A. I want to say folks, thanks so much

(1:25:39) for your questions. We're going to write read through these as fast as possible. Other quick housekeeping. As I mentioned, pinned at the top of the

(1:25:45) chat. David Wood and Daniel Hikatu debate in person on August 3rd in

(1:25:50) Youngstown, Ohio. This is free for the public. I'll be there personally to moderate it. It's at the seek share and

(1:25:57) truth conference linked in the description box as well as at the top of the chat and other stuff coming up very

(1:26:04) relevant. Destiny. If you are in the Los Angeles area, you can debate Destiny on

(1:26:10) our new Outnumbered series with five versus one Tuesday, August 5th. That's in Los

(1:26:16) Angeles. As I had mentioned, shoot an email to modernday debate@gmail.com.

(1:26:21) And shoot an email to modernday debate@gmail.com. In case you want to debate this gentleman at the bottom

(1:26:26) right, Andrew Wilson will be in Chicago August 8th. If you would like to debate him, if you would like to fix his wagon,

(1:26:34) this is your chance in Chicago on August 8th. You can do it in person in our new outnumbered fiveon-one series. Email

(1:26:41) modern day debate@gmail.com. With that, we're going to jump into this next this first question.

(1:26:47) Do you mind if I just point of order? Sorry. Do we get a conclusion just to wrap up to see after the super chats? I think usually

(1:26:53) Oh, that's after super chats. Okay, sure. We can do that. Let's do the super chat and then we'll do that at the end.

(1:26:59) Dwayne, no problem at all. No problem at all. Thanks for your kind words, Dwayne Burke. Appreciate it, brother. And Kaboo

(1:27:05) says, "No, the KKK were Satanists."

(1:27:11) They say that the KKK were Satanist, not Christian. Uh they they had like a manifesto based

(1:27:18) upon God and, you know, the position of, you know, black people in God's plan.

(1:27:24) Like I I don't know where you got that from. Yeah. G Mark, I guess nobody could ever

(1:27:30) adapt religious symbolism for bad things like the Nazis did. Do you think the KKK were um um

(1:27:37) Satanists? I think that they used perverse symbolism to advocate anti-Christian

(1:27:42) beliefs. Yes. Well, do you think they claim to be Christian? Yeah, but that I think that you can also

(1:27:49) make the case you can make the case that anybody can claim that they're anything. Men can claim that they're women, can't they, Mark? Does that make them women?

(1:27:58) Does that make them women? I just stopped listening after Mark, does it does it make a man a woman if he says he is?

(1:28:04) Yeah, I just stopped listening after you said they were Christian. Why won't you answer the question, Mark? Because it's got nothing to do with the

(1:28:09) debate. Yeah, it does. It just shows that you can identify as whatever you want. It doesn't mean that you're that thing. There's specific criteria for these

(1:28:15) things. They're women. Yeah, they are women. Men are the men who declare that they're women are women.

(1:28:21) Right, Mark? Sorry, this one. So, hang on. I just want one more quick followup just real quick. Mark, is Matt

(1:28:28) Ger Hunty gay? Does he does he engage in homosexual? This question was for me. I think this

(1:28:33) question was for me. Um, so Andrew, um, are you doing a no true Christian?

(1:28:38) Is that what you're doing? Oh, you mean a no true Scotsman fallacy? No, I think there's specific criteria for being a Christian.

(1:28:44) You mean that? So, what what is the specific criteria? I think you would have to not being a Christian.

(1:28:50) Yeah. So I think you'd have to start with the fact that many of them did not adopt the Nian Creed and the Nian Creed

(1:28:55) it would be the first category because I just told you there would be specific criteria for the identification of a thing just like there is for a sports

(1:29:01) fan. What's a sports fan Mark? Is that just someone who likes Is that just like someone who likes

(1:29:06) to decide? Why do you get to decide what a Christian is? I thought you weren't a Christian this debate. Well I'm sorry Mark. If that's the case

(1:29:13) then you can't decide what one is either. No I just take whoever says hey I'm a Christian that they're a Christian. Oh,

(1:29:20) okay. So then you just take me at face value when I say I'm a hippopotamus. No.

(1:29:25) Oh, okay. Coming in from do appreciate you. Although I wouldn't be surprised.

(1:29:31) This one is from Bubblegum Gun. Says, "Christians held us in the dark ages for centuries. Communists atheists want to

(1:29:37) drag us back to it. Maybe the truth is a position that rejects both atheism and

(1:29:43) Christianity." You mean that motion? Yeah. Well, I what what would that

(1:29:49) position be? Agnostic. No, agnostic doesn't necessarily reject

(1:29:55) Christianity. It It's uh it basically withholds um

(1:30:03) so it's not that's not rejecting it. It doesn't reject it. Atheism rejects religion. Period. It rejects it. Athe or

(1:30:11) agnosticism does not do that. Well, how do you reject both atheism and

(1:30:17) religion? That's what I that's what I just asked. That's what that's what my question was.

(1:30:22) What would that be? I'm sure there could be a system like that. I just can't think of it off top

(1:30:27) of my head. This one coming in from do appreciate your question made by Jim Bob says,

(1:30:33) "Mark, is child abuse objectively wrong under secularism? And if so, why?"

(1:30:40) Well, secular humanism. Um maybe you didn't have the characters to type it genob. So it's because um you know that

(1:30:47) is obviously not good for the well-being of the child. Absolutely. Like one of the worst things you can do for the

(1:30:53) well-being of the child. So it is objective but only in virtue of well-being being the thing that you're

(1:30:59) after. So you make up the non-objective standard and then you say everything is

(1:31:04) objective in comparison to the non-objective standard. Right. We kind of agree on the standard. Yeah. I think that most people would agree

(1:31:10) that human well-being, their own, their families, their countries is actually important. Disagree.

(1:31:16) But do you see if it's a non-objective standard and then you create an objective standard to the non-objective

(1:31:21) standard, then it would be nonobject, then it would be not objectively true that abusing a child is wrong, right?

(1:31:28) Yes. Yes. Okay. So, abusing a child is not objectively wrong, right?

(1:31:34) Okay. You got it. You show me it's objectively wrong.

(1:31:41) What's that? Mark, can you show me it's objectively wrong? Mark, I would never. Me is the ultimate

(1:31:47) arbiter of morality. Everything I say is what's objectively wrong or right. I think it's objective the question by

(1:31:54) misrepresenting your own position. Interesting. Mark, I'm been representing my whole position the entire time. I have taken

(1:32:00) the role of the delusion. I've accepted. I've seen the light that I'm delusional. But how? Even if I'm delusional, if I

(1:32:07) want all of my policies enforced on society, you never did demonstrate why that would be wrong, Mark. Oh, because people under delusions while

(1:32:14) may be comforting in the short term, it often leads to bad consequences. Like for instance, ignoring that you have to

(1:32:20) actually preserve the planet because you think that your imaginary friend is going to come down and save you. Do you believe secular humanism is true?

(1:32:28) Do you have an imaginary friend? No. Do you believe secular humanism is true? I thought you were delusional. So you

(1:32:33) don't believe in God at all? What are you What are you talking about? I just said even if I accepted that that

(1:32:38) was a delusion, Andrew, are you lying false? So you're telling my question or

(1:32:43) you just lying completely. I just answered your question. I adopted a position for the purposes of a debate. That's how you do logical debate which

(1:32:49) you're now breaking which you're now breaking up multiple times during I literally never broke anything. I

(1:32:56) adopted the position that I'm willing to accept for the position of the debate that I was a delusional Christian just so you could show me how Christianity is

(1:33:02) bad for society. You couldn't. The reason why Wilson adopts this position is because

(1:33:09) defend his own. So unable to defend his own position, he adopts one that he doesn't actually debate about whether or

(1:33:15) not focus off the fact that he can't actually answer any questions about his

(1:33:20) own religion. He just adopts mine. I just want to point that out.

(1:33:27) Hang on, Mark. The opposite. Actually, the it's actually the opposite is true. So, what I said Yeah. So, what I said

(1:33:34) specifically, very specific about this. Okay. For the purpose of the debate, I'm

(1:33:39) willing to rant to you that everything I believe is wrong so that we can see the

(1:33:45) societal effects and you can prove to me that the societal effects of Christianity are bad. Even if I wasn't a

(1:33:52) Christian, you should be able to [ __ ] do that, Mark. Yeah, which I did. When? Where?

(1:33:57) Oh, like all of the atrocities that I brought. Wait, I'm not going over the mountain of evidence I have again,

(1:34:03) bro. Nothing. We'll jump to the next one. But folks, in case you missed that reminder to hit that subscribe button earlier, as well

(1:34:09) as many juicy videos, including the one at the bottom right with Andrew in Chicago in person coming out on Modern

(1:34:15) Day Debate. Hit that subscribe button so you don't miss it. I'm going to hit that subscribers only chat mode in just a sec. so you don't miss out on videos

(1:34:22) like that one. Uh, James, can I say something real quick? Yeah. Imagine being so good faith that you're

(1:34:29) actually willing if your opponent says, "Your position is completely false." to

(1:34:34) literally grant that to them. To literally grant to them, you're right. My position is totally false. Uh, now

(1:34:42) can now to the the meat of the thing we're talking about. Can you show me your social prescriptions being better

(1:34:48) now that I've granted my entire worldview is false? And they still can't [ __ ] do it. And they say that you are

(1:34:54) the one who's being bad. Can you even imagine the cognitive dissonance of a [ __ ] who does that?

(1:35:00) Yes. I I I mean I know that is moronic because the problem is that if you are a

(1:35:06) delusional crazy person putting out there that hey, you should follow this imaginary friend because he's going to

(1:35:11) come and take you away into a fantasy land. It's really bad in the long run for people society because you are going

(1:35:19) to charge towards that doomsday situation like a [ __ ] lemming and then just throw yourself off that cliff

(1:35:26) because you don't care about people. You only care about yourself. You care about

(1:35:32) your delusion. That's all you care about. And in the long run, people with delusions will get themselves into all

(1:35:38) kind of trouble. That's why we have to lock them away. So you taking this position is like saying, "Don't listen

(1:35:44) to me. I'm a crazy guy. I have an imaginary friend. I've got nothing to say. I am absolutely out of my mind."

(1:35:50) Well, I agree with you. I actually agree with you. This is hilarious. Imagine saying, "I have a subjective standard

(1:35:58) that I just believe because I want to and then make objective empirical claims

(1:36:03) against this thing that I made up. And I'm not delusional. You're delusional cuz you believe in something that

(1:36:09) doesn't exist. So does this [ __ ] idiot. He literally made up a standard. This [ __ ] [ __ ] made up a standard

(1:36:15) that he literally admitted is totally made up and then makes impirical claims on his madeup standard and says I'm

(1:36:21) delusional. Why are you calling me names? Why you calling That's the dumbest [ __ ] thing I ever

(1:36:26) heard. Mark, I'm delusional. You do the same thing I'm doing. Why are you calling me names? Do you want to throw some more out there? Hey,

(1:36:33) Oily. Hey, Smoke Stack. Do you want to throw some more names out there? Yeah. Uncle Fester

(1:36:39) going all day. We're going to jump. We're going to jump to the next one. Nice one, Grease Pit. What are you talking about?

(1:36:44) Nice one, Flat Tough. Nice one, Cub. Yeah. Good one, Curly.

(1:36:50) All right. Okay. Now it's kind Now it's kind of getting fun. But wait,

(1:36:56) now it's kind of getting fun. Now suck on that. Suck on that stick, mate. Suck on that stick.

(1:37:01) I suck on this. I We all know what you and Matt Dillah Hunty suck on. Oh, really? Not really.

(1:37:07) Manga Fandan says, "Mark, is it true secular humanists?" They say, "Mark, is it true that secular humanists want us to be cyborgs?"

(1:37:15) Not necessarily. No, no, that's that's people who are um um I can't remember

(1:37:21) the name of that is something different. Um it it's not necessarily that that is a bad thing, but we have not actually

(1:37:28) come to a conclusion over whether that is good or bad. Like I think that a secular humanist would say if that is

(1:37:33) bad for the well-being of humans we absolutely should not do it. If it is good for the well-being of humans then

(1:37:39) maybe we should do it. So this is where you know I I don't know because apparently Wilson is not a Christian

(1:37:45) today. So I don't know where he gets the the things that he says. Apparently he's just deciding today and I might add it's

(1:37:51) not due to any kind of charity that he's decided not to sort of defend Christianity. It was merely just

(1:37:56) I did defend Christianity. Well, wait. I'm sorry, Andrew. Uh, God

(1:38:03) not real. So, you're delusional. Okay, I'll just grant that for you then, and then we'll see if the social effects for

(1:38:08) you are any better. That's bad faith. That's bad faith that you actually grant the very position

(1:38:13) that I'm trying to demonstrate in order to show me the fulliness of a delusional person. I wouldn't listen to

(1:38:18) because Mark, if I'm listening to my imaginary friend, then you're listening to an arbitrary metric you made the [ __ ]

(1:38:24) up. and then empirically make objective against it. I didn't make up human health. Then you just have faith in the people

(1:38:29) who did. Do you think I made up human health? Do you think I made up? I think that you have faith in people who make up standards that they can't

(1:38:36) they and Oh, you don't think human health is a standard? A standard for what though?

(1:38:42) What do you mean a standard for what? It's human health. So here's the dishonesty. Wilson also

(1:38:48) already granted that you can tell how healthy a human is. That it's it's measurable. And now he wants to go, "Oh, we just made up those aren't the

(1:38:55) standards that ether. It's not a thing. I made it up. Just like I made up anti

(1:39:01) antisocial personality disorder. I made it up. Yeah. Show. Ought we follow human

(1:39:06) health? Ought we follow human health? Yeah. Ought we make people healthy as

(1:39:11) possible? Ought we do that? What? Against their will? Just period.

(1:39:17) There's a there's a whole lot in there. You can't just sort of force people ought we do anything ever. Ought we do

(1:39:24) at least something. Yes. Okay. If we ought at least do something,

(1:39:30) whatever your grounding is for that ought is made the [ __ ] up. You're making it up out of thin air.

(1:39:37) No. No. It's literally a human well-being isn't something that's just made up. It is something that

(1:39:43) exists. Me basically subscribing to that is basically saying, "Hey, yeah, I'm

(1:39:50) going to work towards that." It's not just made up. The fact that I select it

(1:39:55) that the fact that I select it is is not, you know, obviously that's my stance. That's my subjective opinion.

(1:40:02) But we've got So you have a fake standard and then you just believe it. See how that works? It's not a fake standard. It's opted for

(1:40:10) the one you've opted for. If I go to the store and choose this coffee cup, I select this coffee cup, but my stance is

(1:40:16) that I I want a good coffee cup and I select this one. Is this coffee cup made up? Only if you say I ought to buy it and

(1:40:22) then give whatever that reason is made. Is the coffee cup made up? Yeah, but I never said the coffee cup wasn't.

(1:40:27) Oh, it is made up. Oh, it doesn't exist. Oh, what a philosopher. Oh, amazing. Amazing. The coffee cup exists in material

(1:40:33) reality. Exactly. Exactly. Then why are you saying human health doesn't exist? I'll tell you what. Steel man, my

(1:40:39) argument steel man my argument. and I'll steal manurs yours. You're basically saying that because the

(1:40:45) I have a stance on what I want to work towards any ought that I ascribe to that

(1:40:51) is is basically made up out of the blue and arbitrary because the original goal

(1:40:58) is made up. That's your steel man. Okay, I'll clarify and then I'll explain

(1:41:05) what what I mean. What my point is is you have no stance independent reason for an ought.

(1:41:11) Do you understand that? No stance independent reason for an ought. Therefore,

(1:41:17) anything which you ought do is based on your stance, which means you made it the

(1:41:22) [ __ ] up, Mark. No, the the reason why is because I select human well-being. I'll give you

(1:41:29) basically it means the next. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. It's just it's just this is a total mischaracterization. I'm not

(1:41:34) saying that it's an objective moral system. I'm saying that because I work towards human well-being. And you

(1:41:40) admitted this yourself. If I chop off somebody's head, it's obviously bad for human well-being. And that isn't stance dependent. That isn't something that I

(1:41:46) go, "Oh, well, I think it is this. I think that human well-being will be increased by, you know, putting cyanide

(1:41:53) in everybody's food." That is not the case. So, you're absolutely wrong. The second you say I ought not chop

(1:42:00) somebody's head off, it's a stance dependent reason, isn't it? It's a stance dependent metaethical um

(1:42:07) framework. So stance dependent reason. And so if if that's the case, you can't give us

(1:42:13) anything other than cuz I don't [ __ ] want you to. So the second you say that

(1:42:19) I'm empirically deriving data from this thing, Mark, you made that [ __ ] thing

(1:42:24) up. We must go to the next one. Uh Mark, if you want to like I told you I'd give you

(1:42:29) the last word. If you want to like a super Yeah. Yeah. Please just put like literally like seconds.

(1:42:35) I didn't make up human well-being. All of these things exist. Human well-being, oppression, um you know, all of these

(1:42:41) things exist in the world. If I want to make my goal to be to build a house, that's not made up either. It's just,

(1:42:46) you know, he wants to characterize it like this because he wants it to be completely arbitrary. And it's not completely arbitrary.

(1:42:51) We we uh do completely arbitrary. completely.

(1:42:56) Word or is Andrew Wilson just going to No, I thought we both got closing statements. We

(1:43:02) Oh, this is your closing statement. Oh, fantastic. I thought that that's what we were getting into was closing statements. No, that was the

(1:43:08) giving him the last word on that question. Question was originally for him. What I want to do is folks, if you

(1:43:14) happen to have a question, you can also, if you put a donation in at the gofundme t pinned at the top of the live chat,

(1:43:20) that's where we'll be using those cameras that we are fundraising for for the upcoming Andrew Wilson in-person

(1:43:26) debate. So, do put your donation in there. No matter what amount you give,

(1:43:32) we will read your question. Just tag me in the live chat. Say, "Hey, James, like I just made a donation to the GoFundMe."

(1:43:37) Uh, we appreciate that because YouTube does not take 40% out of that, which is awesome. And we will read your question

(1:43:44) no matter how long it is or maybe it's like a long number of sentences, but don't go crazy with it. Just let me know

(1:43:51) if you put in a donation at the GoFundMe pinned at the top of the live chat right now as that is a huge priority for us.

(1:43:57) We're 82% of the way. This one coming in from evangelists. As a former real atheist, I would run circles around

(1:44:04) Mark. He's fake. Like a teenager that says, quote, "I don't believe in no God,

(1:44:11) but likes to play with all the toys of a god worldview such as morality and

(1:44:16) logic." Yeah. Morality isn't exclusive to religion. It is something that is the

(1:44:22) code of conduct accepted by all rational people in a society. It isn't something that's exclusive to religion, nor would

(1:44:28) any philosopher say so. Um that the idea that you were a real atheist. Yeah, I've heard that one before. But hey, let's

(1:44:34) just assume you are. Let's just grant that you you were like run rings around me. You didn't even give a a a single

(1:44:40) argument there. Like you didn't actually sort of counter anything that I had to say.

(1:44:45) Hey, uh that that whole uh have to base it on rationality and reason and that's

(1:44:51) where all the odds come from. Are any of those uh independent of your stance, Mark?

(1:44:56) They exist outside of your own personal stance. Any of those? What do you mean? when you ought do

(1:45:02) something. Do you have any stance independent reason why anybody ought to do anything? Are you just going back to the previous

(1:45:07) thing we were on? Like I'm just asking you. I'm just asking you because you just said that. Yeah, cuz we got in the weeds and I was

(1:45:12) told independent still didn't get the time final word and now you're trying to get an extra word on this that was on

(1:45:19) the last super chat. I could talk on this one. Mark, do you have a stance independent reason for any

(1:45:25) a stance independent reason? Um, no. Okay, then it's just made up [ __ ]

(1:45:31) bro. Doesn't mean it's arbitrary. Doesn't mean it's made up. [ __ ] Okay. Well, then I'm sorry. Human health is not made

(1:45:37) up. And the reasons why we can know that whether something is healthy and something is not healthy is not

(1:45:43) arbitrary either. You're just trying to make it seem arbitrary because all of your odds are arbitrary. Explain where

(1:45:49) you get your morality from, where it comes from, and why you follow it. It comes from you. Because God says, "I just want to follow

(1:45:56) my morality." Imaginary friend. Because Mark says you are. Look, and I don't know why I'd

(1:46:01) listen to a delusional person anyway. I don't know why I'd listen to a delusional person who says that they could get an aunt from themselves.

(1:46:07) Let's go to the next one. That's the pinnacle of delusion. You [ __ ] idiot. And it's not just myself. And I know

(1:46:12) this. You just said word, James. Can I have the final word? Because it seems like you just said it's a it's you have no

(1:46:18) stance independent reasons. You're the ultimate arbiter of morality. Mark, you I do want to give in.

(1:46:24) Well, it's not just my stance. The thing is it's intersubjective. It is agreed upon by between a whole bunch of people

(1:46:31) that we want the best for our society for those people. Hey, can you not

(1:46:36) interrupt Andrew? I need you to ask. Could you mute Andrew for a second because I'm no

(1:46:43) what I need here is gentlemen, I do need to be we have a lot of questions to go through. All right. All right. I'll be angry at me if we don't get through some

(1:46:49) of these. And I do you seem very upset, Mark. Oh, you're you're a gem, sir. You're such a gem. Yeah.

(1:46:56) Oppression, hatred. I bet you're regretting that. I got out of bed this morning. No. Both. So Christian. So Christian. I

(1:47:02) love So atheist. So atheist. Okay. So we have to jump into the next one. So

(1:47:09) I do want to if there is a challenge to either one of you, I typically want to give that person the last word because

(1:47:14) otherwise it's like the super chat challenging, you know, guy X and then guy Y jumps on guy X as well. So that's

(1:47:21) why often times these super chats are for Mark or I want to give Mark the last word. And so uh you guys I need you to

(1:47:28) work with me on this because we've got a lot of questions. This one coming in from Jeff Klein says the second a moral

(1:47:33) anti-realist agrees there is at least one thing in existence which remains unchanging. Their entire worldview is

(1:47:40) defeated. Just one. That's the exact same from last week. Marco a chance to

(1:47:46) respond. Yeah, I I don't know what would be unchanging. I don't know what that would

(1:47:51) be. Everything in the universe seems to be in a flux of change. Nothing seems to change at all perhaps. Uh

(1:47:59) James, can you just mute him again? If he won't actually shut the [ __ ] up, could you just mute him? Like seriously, this is getting ridiculous.

(1:48:05) Does math change though? Uh shut up, Andrew. Andrew, shut up. Andrew. Andrew, let's at least like is

(1:48:11) that because it is it is kind of like if if you're speaking over You do know we didn't start with

(1:48:16) calculus, you idiot. You know calculus. So calculus didn't exist. We made it up.

(1:48:22) So it could change, right? So it can change calculus. Calculus can change.

(1:48:28) Well, we can add to it. Sure. But you said calculus change abraction.

(1:48:33) Can 2 + 2= 5? Stop this guy because he will not change. You just asked me a question,

(1:48:38) [ __ ] Can 2 plus 2 equal 5? Mark, my question was, do you know

(1:48:43) can 2 plus you know that we made that up? Can two No, we didn't make it up. Can 2 plus two equal 5?

(1:48:49) Well, is that the same in every universe? There's more than one universe.

(1:48:54) I don't know. Is it? Well, then what do you mean? What can in the universe you know, can 2 plus two ever equal anything but five?

(1:49:01) Everything seems to be in a state of change. There may be some abstractions that we keep the same but without minds

(1:49:07) which die off and get seem to end there there are no constants that we're aware

(1:49:12) of that will be constant from the start of the universe to the end of the universe to anything that may happen to

(1:49:18) be beyond the universe. We don't know. So I don't know that is unchanging

(1:49:24) throughout you know the entire cosmos. Okay gentlemen I'm I just I just want to answer to my question. Yes or no?

(1:49:29) Yeah. Move on. It's not your time to ask questions. Okay. We're going to the next question. Red Fox says, "Mark, you need

(1:49:35) to read David Hume. You can not conflate a descriptive and prescriptive

(1:49:40) statement. Next time, just concede the point." ought from an is.

(1:49:46) I'm not getting an ought from an is. And I'm not conceding like making a prescription based upon a statement of

(1:49:52) fact. It's an if statement. It's if you care about human well-being, then this is what we should do to promote human

(1:49:58) being. It's an ought from an if. I don't prescribe because human being uh human well-being is a thing that you have to

(1:50:05) pay attention to it, you have to follow it. No, that's not what I'm doing. So, it's not a problem under Humes guillotine.

(1:50:11) This is from AJ Anderson says to both Andrew and Mark, is it okay to be white? If not, is it okay to be black?

(1:50:18) Yeah, it's fine to be white. I don't It's fine to be black. Is it fine to be black, Andrew?

(1:50:24) Yeah. There you go. We could We agreed on something. Awesome. And you both agree that's okay to be white.

(1:50:31) Yeah. So Tristan Sartine says, "If you look at a population graph of the world, we didn't

(1:50:37) hit 1 billion until 80 1804. Why do we need to hit replacement levels when for

(1:50:44) most of human history, we haven't been this full?" Excellent question, and I will explain

(1:50:50) it to you. There was a book written by stupid secularists called The Population Bomb.

(1:50:55) Oh, books don't count anymore. That's basically what happens. He doesn't agree with the book, so doesn't matter. Oh, okay.

(1:51:01) Oh, sorry, Andrew. I thought I could just interrupt you whenever you wanted and not let you talk. That's what you've been doing. Is that fair?

(1:51:06) Do you see me sping Is that fair? Do you see me spuring? Is that fair? Do you see about it? Well, I see you. You just don't not

(1:51:13) continuing. What? What? Aren't you trying to say something? Are you trying to say something? What are you trying to say? Have you lost Have you lost it?

(1:51:19) What? Thought I be fair. Yeah, it's good for human wellbeing. Sure. Oh, okay. Then do you do you want to not

(1:51:25) be fair? Do you want to like be unfair and sort of imprison people? Nothing in this one. Let's go to the next one.

(1:51:31) Let's go to the next one. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, I'll answer the question if if No, no, no, no. I don't think so. We go to the next one. See?

(1:51:36) Okay. But just remember that I'm going to hold that same standard on the next one for you, Mark. No, I'm giving you a taste of your own.

(1:51:42) I'll give you a taste medicine back. Do you want to stop interrupting, Andrew? Do you want to stop

(1:51:48) interrupting? So now you want to make a deal. Okay, now So next one. Scabby mix scatterson says

(1:51:53) BIP DB says bring inerson debates back. Thanks for your support. Bluetooth

(1:51:58) speaker says why what even are secular principles and how can you determine it's stealing from the Christian

(1:52:05) worldview? What is the real grounding to the principles?

(1:52:12) Yeah. So there's a lot of different principles like you know sort of alleviating suffering humans we can't let you talk things like

(1:52:20) well let you talk um you know the the uh rights to freedom and the rights to

(1:52:26) satisfaction um and all of the um that we follow are

(1:52:32) based upon that metaethical framework of human well-being psychological wellbeing

(1:52:38) and societal wellbeing which is sort of at least I'm giving a framework for understanding where these come from.

(1:52:44) Thank you. This one coming in from Sunflower says, "Mark, the pass the trash law in New

(1:52:49) Jersey officially quote public law 2018 C5 is designed to protect students from

(1:52:55) educators with a history of child abuse or sexual misconduct passed because it

(1:53:01) was happening so all caps much in public schools."

(1:53:08) Yeah. And there are like public schools are supposed to be secular but that doesn't mean they are all secular

(1:53:13) humanists throughout public schools. Um but at least the institution is actually doing something about it unlike the

(1:53:19) church which just pretends it isn't happening. Says a me a culpa and then basically puts these guys in another

(1:53:25) place so they can do exactly the same thing. The amount of priests actually prosecuted is criminally low compared

(1:53:31) with the amount of accusations. There was a bishop in Australia called George Pel and he had his conviction

(1:53:37) overturned. went back to the Vatican, went back to exactly what he was doing. He was rewarded for his crimes, which is

(1:53:43) just terrible. It's estimated, it's estimated inside of public schools

(1:53:48) that some 90 to 95% of all the cases of sexual misconduct go completely unreported because they're in a position

(1:53:55) of power over children just like those priests are. Anytime you have people who are in positions of authority and

(1:54:02) there's a lot of children around, you're going to find predators who are going to move into those positions of authority. The distinction between me rational

(1:54:08) person. Mark irrational person. He attributes this to religion instead of understanding that it actually has

(1:54:14) nothing to do with religion at all. Has to do with the predation of children. And if people are in positions of power

(1:54:19) to cover up their uh predatorial behavior towards children, they will

(1:54:25) regardless of what institution they're in, secular or religious. And he never

(1:54:31) has disputed this once. Not once. Chris one coming in from do appreciate

(1:54:36) your question. Can I just answer that because that question was for me. I'll just quickly answer it that it's not about whether the individual tries to

(1:54:42) cover it up. It's whether the institution tries to cover it up. And if there is a school or an institution

(1:54:47) which has some kind of sexual predator and they abuse a child and the institution covers it up, that

(1:54:53) institution should be closed, shut down, burnt to the ground, and never ever

(1:54:58) restarted again. No more public schools. Unfortunately, religion gets a big pass for that. The Catholic Church is still

(1:55:03) there. They've been horrendous. The Eastern Orthodox Church is still there. Their bishops have done awful things.

(1:55:09) Um, if the institution covers it up, I agree that that institution should be

(1:55:14) shut down, the entire thing wiped, and we go for something else because they have no moral stance.

(1:55:19) Would you apply that to public schools at public schools that need to be shut down because there's cover public school

(1:55:25) institution that does it? That doesn't mean we shut down every public school. It's like exactly like church. Excuse me.

(1:55:32) Exactly like with the church. Excuse me. Excuse me. Just because the Catholic Church did horrible ped PDF

(1:55:39) file abuse doesn't mean that we should go and shut down the second Baptist

(1:55:44) church over in America. But the Catholic Church should be shut down. The Eastern Orthodox Church only the specific

(1:55:50) church. They have done horrible things young people and shut down. So public schools if that school does

(1:55:57) it, that school if that church does it, they they get shut down. Not the whole Not every Catholic church doofus.

(1:56:04) You don't shut every Catholic. Yes, you did. You said don't go. Yes. You said the Catholic Church should be shut down.

(1:56:11) The church. Yes. The papacy was involved. Oh my god, dude. Give me a break.

(1:56:17) You just got [ __ ] destroyed on that logic. Weird. You're such a weirdo. Mero 409

(1:56:24) says, "Sexual oppression, that's the same logic Germany used to justify sending children to live with PDF files

(1:56:32) during the Kentler experiment because sexual oppression quote caused Nazism."

(1:56:40) Yeah. Okay. So, a Godwin's law and b um you know, like why would you think that

(1:56:46) that is good for human well-being? What makes you think that abusing a child is

(1:56:51) good for their their their physical their mental health? Anything to do with them? I don't know. I It's so weird that

(1:56:59) you're saying so. It's so so strange. Like transitioning them, Mark.

(1:57:05) What do you mean? Like giving them giving them uh puberty blockers when they're kids. Does this got anything to do with

(1:57:11) Yeah, I mean that would be bad for kids and abuse, right? Okay. So there is a prevalence of

(1:57:17) children um with these kind of neurological sustained disorders um and

(1:57:23) ones that just have um trans identity um losing their lives by their own hand.

(1:57:30) How would we fix that? Oh, actually we just discovered that that's not true, didn't we? When the

(1:57:37) when it went in front of the court, what happened was the defense literally said,

(1:57:42) "We actually cannot verify that not giving these affirmations and treatments has led to a single suicide." Not a

(1:57:50) single one, Mark. That you haven't been able to verify a single one that's relational, Mark. Not a single one.

(1:57:56) Do you do you um agree that the the rate of that is higher among the trans

(1:58:02) children? Yeah, but that's not necessary. You deny that. You deny that? Wow. Mark,

(1:58:08) lack of reality. Mark, hang on. Let me respond on this one. James, let me respond. You guys, the truth is Mark, given the

(1:58:15) accounting for why it was truth, sir, have truth. Give me the accounting. You just lied and said that

(1:58:22) never happened. You just said no. You said no. Yeah. So, anyway, back in the 30s, Mark, why weren't all the trans kids killing

(1:58:28) themselves? What do you mean? How come if it's the case that they were more discriminated

(1:58:35) against in the 30s than they are now, less of them were killing themselves? Why is that? Because we didn't know they were trans

(1:58:40) either to So, I guess staying in the closet keeps them alive. Because we them, they couldn't have had

(1:58:47) that problem. Are you a [ __ ] Yeah, so we created the problem and now

(1:58:52) they're killing themselves. Genius, Mark, we didn't create the problem. We just didn't know that they were trans and

(1:58:58) they died. Wait, you realize that you're going to have an x amount of proportion who are always going to be trans of the

(1:59:04) population? There are some absolute how come child suicide rates was so far down

(1:59:09) monsters. I can't think of who some absolute monsters who go out of their way to um victimize and and and and

(1:59:17) oppress and and and treat them badly that makes their mental health filling them up with hormones like you

(1:59:23) do. Who would that be, Wilson? You monster. That would be you. It would be you disfiguring children. You sick [ __ ] You

(1:59:31) disfiguring children. Sick bastard. Absolute delusional. Here we go. Early bird 2248 says,

(1:59:37) "Christianity is just a new version of ancient blood magic. The tribe would place their sins or wrongdoings onto a

(1:59:44) single person or animal and sacrifice it in order to please the gods." I think that's for you, Andrew.

(1:59:53) Okay. This one coming in from Gary Newman says, "Doesn't immigrating people

(1:59:58) concede the point that population decrease is bad?"

(2:00:05) Population decrease is there's some problems with it. It's it's not necessarily bad, especially if there is

(2:00:10) an overpopulated country. Um, like for instance, China was looking like it would be overpop populated and unable to

(2:00:16) sustain themselves, which is why they did the one child policy, which is not a good response to it considering the cultural norms of China. But, you know,

(2:00:23) it's not necessarily a a bad thing. This one from Robin Webster says, "If

(2:00:28) Christianity leads to morality, why hasn't it worked in 2,000 years, Andrew?" Great job, Mark.

(2:00:34) It has. Thanks. This one it's the only it's the only codifi only codified universal form of ethics which

(2:00:41) has worked in fact long term and it still continues. I mean all of the backbone of Mark is dependent on

(2:00:48) Christian ethics being in society. Otherwise what would stop guys like me from just rounding all of them up and

(2:00:54) doing away with them? Like we could we could say that there's a that you could always make the case

(2:01:00) that there's some demographic or group which is problematic causes you issues. If you don't have some universal moral

(2:01:05) aught or some universalized reason why human life is uh is sacrian, why it

(2:01:10) needs to be protected, why you're not allowed to do these horrible things to people, that's stance independent, then

(2:01:17) any justification I make to do any horrible thing, I can just say it's based on my stance like Markx and they just don't understand that. I don't know

(2:01:23) why they don't understand that, but that's the case. Well, Andrew doesn't understand that.

(2:01:29) Well, Andrew doesn't understand if we all agree that human well-being is important that I want to take care of people and you want to take care of

(2:01:34) people and the society and then we we can we can live like that. It doesn't need Christianity and Christianity has

(2:01:41) been delivering this lie for ages. Societies have developed just fine without Christianity. And the idea that

(2:01:46) suddenly we're this moral thing because Christianity has caused it. Oh, get get real. Yeah. No society actually has developed

(2:01:52) well without it. And by the way, on top of that, let's just point this out. Yeah. Let me point this out too. If we all just agreed, Mark, to be Christians,

(2:01:58) then that solves the problem too, right? No, this one problem. Oh, it doesn't. Okay.

(2:02:04) Did it solve the problem when the Catholic Church went in and kicked the eth Orthodox church back in what 105?

(2:02:10) Did it solve the problem with secularist when they instituted communism and killed all the secular

(2:02:17) humanist? Yeah. Move those posts. Yeah. Well done. They say, "Mark, if genetic testing of

(2:02:23) parents identifies potential risk for disabilities in offspring, should breeding be outlawed to outlawed to

(2:02:29) prevent harm?" Uh, no. No. Although, you know, the the parents definitely should be made aware

(2:02:36) of the risk and it may be um certainly encouraged for them not to. But I think

(2:02:42) that sort of bodily autonomy we should give leeway to people having the freedom. Like I pointed out in my

(2:02:47) introduction, there's certain things that we need to be well. One of them is safety and security. One of them is

(2:02:53) certain freedoms to be able to live our lives with our own beliefs. So I wouldn't I wouldn't unless it comes to incest with brothers,

(2:02:59) right, Mark? Then you got to lock them up, right? This one from Shog. I don't see how incest with brothers

(2:03:06) leads to human well-being. Perhaps you could explain that one to Well, I don't I don't see how allowing people to have children who have genetic

(2:03:12) deficiencies which can be spread leads to human well-being either, Mark. This is from Michael. So people like Steven Hawking we should

(2:03:19) just get rid of. Well, for the overarching good, Mark, why can't you make

(2:03:24) So you think we should kill people like Steven Hawking? Is that Did I say Did I think we should kill people or did I say that you can make

(2:03:29) the case for the overarching good that if you eliminated people had like Huntington's disease? I I wouldn't suggest that. I wouldn't

(2:03:35) suggest that. I mean I'm horrified that you do but I wouldn't I didn't but I just what I said was why

(2:03:40) Mark if you can eliminate Huntington's disease by simply not allowing the parents to breed wouldn't you this one

(2:03:45) because there's not just physical benefits in people like Steven Hawking he had a genetic disease but he

(2:03:51) contributed a ton towards society ancestous brothers do the same thing unlike you I don't just look at people

(2:03:57) and go hey you know we we that's the only thing is their body and their their faith and that's their religion

(2:04:04) or their minds and their other. So incestuous people can't give us Incest Brothers couldn't give us any contributions to science.

(2:04:10) I didn't say I'd lock up incest brothers. I said treat them. We would treat them.

(2:04:15) Treat them for what? They don't think they're doing anything wrong. Mark Michael, this one from Michael Kimble

(2:04:22) says, "Mark, Mark, how would you feel if they said, "How would you feel?" They said, "Mark, how Mark, how would

(2:04:29) you feel if you didn't have breakfast this morning?" How would I feel? Hungry?

(2:04:35) Gotcha. Shurog Andi says, "The solution to low birth rates in places like Japan and South Korea would be educating the

(2:04:41) public while having policies to encourage having babies. It's not religion."

(2:04:46) Oh, okay. So, um, educating them to have babies when in fact the most of the

(2:04:53) reason they're not having babies is because women defer their childbearing gears for education. That's brilliant,

(2:04:59) you [ __ ] idiot. This one from Appreciate your Well done. Just swear. Call the audience

(2:05:04) names. That's classy. That guy was stupid. What do you want me to say? Airborne. Airborne. You say stupid [ __ ] I'm going to call

(2:05:10) you stupid. You say stupid [ __ ] I say nothing about nothing. You say the stupidest [ __ ] I've ever

(2:05:16) Tell me one thing I've said which is stupid. Mark airborne. One thing that you've said is stupid. Okay.

(2:05:21) Why don't I just lock up all secular humanists? Why? Why? Why don't I do that? Yeah, that's a that's an internal

(2:05:27) critique, not a position, doofus. It's dumbassery is what it is. Oh, it's dumbassery. Oh, you got me.

(2:05:33) Airborne says, "No one gets you, Wilson." Nobody gets you. Except for thousands upon thousands of

(2:05:39) people watching me right now and the dozen watching you. Does that make you feel good? Does that make you feel? It does.

(2:05:45) Yes. Yeah, it does make you feel good. Yeah. How shallow everyone feels good? Okay. Secular

(2:05:50) humanism has no way to objectively determine what is good or bad, right and wrong. Trying to get Mark to answer a

(2:05:56) question honestly is like trying to pull teeth from a hippopotamus. Uh, yeah. So, at least I answered

(2:06:02) questions. And I did answer them honestly. I I told you what I believe. It's Andrew Wilson that basically says, "Well, no, I'm not going to have my

(2:06:08) stance. I'm not going to be a Christian for the things." Just lies his ass off because, you know, apparently that's a thing you can do in Christianity. God

(2:06:14) lied a Christian apparently. So, be aware that this is your representative in the Christian sphere. Just calling

(2:06:20) people names, lying his ass off, being dodgy, evasive. Wi-Fi gospel says, "Pardon my we have so

(2:06:26) many." By the way, folks, super chat at your own risk. Sure. We we just we have I think one of these guys is going to

(2:06:31) take off before we're able to finish all of them, but I'm going to keep trying to charge along. Wi-Fi Gospel says, "Smoking causes health problems which

(2:06:38) raises the cost of medical care for society. This reduces other people's well-being. In order to be consistent,

(2:06:43) you must be in favor of outlawing it. Mark, why aren't you?" Well, that's the same case as saying,

(2:06:49) "Hey, if you go mountain biking, there's a great chance of being injured." And that's put a cost on the system as well.

(2:06:54) You've got to balance basically people wanting to take risks with people being

(2:07:00) having responsibility to society. Nobody's going to say, "Hey, you're not allowed to do anything because it could

(2:07:06) do this." No, we don't we don't do that. And I I might point out that actually New Zealand is actually doing that. It's

(2:07:12) making smoking illegal for everybody under the age of 18. And it might actually be a good idea as there's no

(2:07:17) real benefit to anybody for smoking. Not to yourself, not to your family, not to the country, not to anybody for smoking.

(2:07:24) It's why I quit. Yeah. But but

(2:07:29) it's just like endless [ __ ] question begging, dude. I don't understand how you how how you

(2:07:35) understand that you're not reconciling the position. He's saying that smoking for humanity is bad, but you don't want

(2:07:42) to outlaw it based on your version of human autonomy. That actually makes sense. I'm willing to grant that that makes sense. What doesn't make sense is

(2:07:49) how you're willing to then say that things like incest that are non-reproductive could possibly be bad

(2:07:55) if it's based around autonomy even if you think it's harmful to the consenting adults like smoking. You've never

(2:08:00) reconciled that Mark. This one from Yeah. Because some of these things have a risk of harm and that does major

(2:08:07) damage to the psyche of the individuals involved and we can study that. I mean, if you want to, you know, be a science denier, I don't care. You be a science

(2:08:14) deny all you want. But that is the standard for what I first of all. I just read your study. No, it's not. I'm going to tell you. No,

(2:08:20) I literally have your study up here. What do you think your study says? Do you think that your study says that if

(2:08:25) two brothers entered into a consensual incestuous relationship that that does them harm? Show me in your study where

(2:08:30) it says that, doofus. I'm literally looking at it. Show me. Show me.

(2:08:37) Uh, you want me to go through it all? Yes. and just any standard for that. Show me

(2:08:42) any standard. Why don't you read it? Why don't you I do I have it in front of me. I can't find anything related to this at all.

(2:08:48) Um the the father daughter incess seems to indicate that Oh, father daughter. Oh, father

(2:08:54) daughter. You lying sack of [ __ ] It's different. Yeah, it's different. You're a lying sack of dog [ __ ]

(2:09:01) Hey, hey, hey. No, I said incest. You are now saying that it's different

(2:09:07) between different family members. Why are you duh?

(2:09:13) What? You asked for proof that incest is I asked for proof that brothers who are

(2:09:19) in a consensualist. You moved that goal post. No, you're moving the goalpost. You sent me some [ __ ] about father and daughter.

(2:09:26) And by the way, tons of studies. It says, it says, it says, and I'll finish

(2:09:32) this because you are being an absolute douchebag. It shows evidence of psychological

(2:09:38) impairment. The incestuous behavior can be positive. Fathers and daughters, a daughter attempt at solving problems.

(2:09:47) So, you've got to make me find something that's spec. What do you Why don't you narrow it to this particular person and

(2:09:53) that particular person? You absolute goof moving fever moving douchebag mad

(2:10:02) I've given you a paper how incest you want to be a science denier you how am I denying science you live back

(2:10:09) in the dark ages you absolut

(2:10:17) [Music] I know that folks I know that it looks

(2:10:23) like these like like, "Oh my gosh, this is so bad." It's just a debate, folks. Relax. Don't don't worry, folks. If

(2:10:29) you're worried, you know, they're they're passionate. This one from even Laura says, "Andrew is cooking an omelette with this egg."

(2:10:37) This one from Listen, Mark has a beautiful a beautiful

(2:10:42) head. And this one from Miro 409 says, "He knew more on psychology." Okay, this

(2:10:52) Kaboo says, "Uh, KKK, we're the devil." I'm going to speed through some of these folks just because I do want to. Robin

(2:10:58) Webster says, "Andrew crashed out like a pickle jar." Um, Batman says,

(2:11:05) uh, got him says Christianity provided orphanages, care for widows, public hospitals,

(2:11:10) charity, and medical aid organizations, as well as, uh, but secular humanism

(2:11:16) provided Marxism with a death toll in the hundreds of millions. Thoughts? Hang on. Uh, real real quick, uh, before

(2:11:22) Mark responds to the super chat. I'm not responding to the super chat either, Mark. on the jar thing. I just want to remind both that super chatter and Mark

(2:11:30) that while it's true I couldn't open an olive jar once live. That's true. You nobody will ever care about you enough

(2:11:37) to care if you fail at opening an olive jar. I just want to point that out. Who me?

(2:11:42) Yeah, both of you. Oh, wow. The gaslighting. How interesting. How manipulative. Wow.

(2:11:48) Okay. Everyone cares about everybody. This one coming in from Wi-Fi. So Christian,

(2:11:54) this one from Barry Joshua Baker says, "Mark, if there's no Do you think nobody cares about me? Do

(2:12:00) you think my wife doesn't care about me?" Is that Nobody will ever care about you enough to worry about whether or not you open

(2:12:05) an olive jar once. I can tell you that. Okay, this coming in from Joshua,

(2:12:11) Mark, if because you're a completely irrelevant personality in the sphere. That's how I know that.

(2:12:17) Cuz cuz you're delusional. Yeah. Gotcha. Joshua Baker says, "Mark, if there's no judgment in the afterlife,

(2:12:22) then there's no difference between Hitler and Mother Teresa in the final analysis." Okay, so this this is a good good point

(2:12:29) and I like your question. So basically the the heaven and hell thing, the you know whether you get a reward or

(2:12:35) punishment, it's not dependent on how you acted in this life. It's dependent on whether you believe and accept God.

(2:12:40) So it isn't actually a moral standard like you can be like Dharma in jail and find God just before you die and

(2:12:46) suddenly you get rewarded. So, it's a really immoral system from Christianity because you can continue to do horrible

(2:12:53) things. And basically, um, you're you're you'll be rewarded at the end of the day. And all Christians know this. They

(2:12:59) know they can do horrible things and still get into heaven. They basically bet on that. The thing is that sort of

(2:13:05) saying, "Hey, well, you'll die anyway." Yeah, but you'll have a really bad life before you die if you do horrible

(2:13:10) things. Yeah, but who cares? It's not good for your wellbeing. It's not good for your psychological wellbeing. It's not, you know, you will be miserable

(2:13:16) like this miserable [ __ ] down here. Um, if you do things then don't say don't talk about James like

(2:13:21) that. That was mean. This one down here. You're at the bottom. You are the bottom. No, you're the bottom.

(2:13:27) You're the bottom on my I'm telling you James at the bottom. You just don't know it. This one from Yeah, but we all know who the miserable

(2:13:33) [ __ ] is, Wilson. Like, we all know who that is. You're the one who seems very upset, not me. I'm not upset. I'm just

(2:13:39) You seem very upset. I'm amazed at your stupidity. Yeah, you should be amazed. I am pretty.

(2:13:44) I am. I am a ghast. In fact, excellent. One second. Okay. Bernaby

(2:13:51) says, "Matt Reed, can you I think they mean Mark.

(2:13:56) Can you grant Andrew's position and say secular humanists don't have ought claims then critique his worldview?"

(2:14:05) Um, no. I I can't. I'm personally happy to say that they don't have objective

(2:14:10) ought claims because it's based upon a subjective thing of where you're going,

(2:14:15) but it doesn't mean you can have no ought claims at all. That's the thing. Like you you you're basically saying,

(2:14:20) "Oh, because it's not objective. It's not an ought claim." No, that's not how morality works and that's not how ought

(2:14:26) claims work. It is simply a code of conduct agreed upon by all rational people. That that's it. It doesn't say

(2:14:31) it has to be objective. It doesn't say anything of the sort. It's just the dodge is that oh well yours is

(2:14:37) subjective. I'd love to know whether Andrews is subjective or objective, but he won't actually talk to me about where his moral system comes from. So there's

(2:14:44) no way to find this out. And this is the dodge. He won't actually comes from. So

(2:14:51) yeah. So um Christianity and its claims of objective, Andrews is just as bad because he's basing it on subjective as

(2:14:58) well. It's just at the end of the day, what Andrew decides to do will will eventuate into a world that you won't

(2:15:04) want to live. Whereas, if we treat people with dignity and respect and care for them, it will turn into a nice nicer

(2:15:11) world. It'll turn into a nice world where you can call men women and and you can give little children home.

(2:15:17) Now, I think the other thing was talking about your perspective, and it's very hard to say because Andrew is

(2:15:22) misrepresenting what he actually believes to say, hey, it's just all subjective as well. Um, just because it was so long. Sorry.

(2:15:29) Anonymous 51939. And both of you are long-winded, so I'm not trying to pick on you, Mark. Um, you say for Mark,

(2:15:37) given that humans are not always rational and can be swayed by emotions and biases, how does secular humanism

(2:15:42) ensure consistent ethical decisionmaking?

(2:15:48) Yeah. Well, it's it's doing documents like um these these uh intentions like the humanist manifesto. And yeah, we're

(2:15:55) going to have disagreements on stuff, but generally we will be working towards the same thing. Um, every human's going

(2:16:00) to have disagreements with other humans. It's not sort of something that is um um

(2:16:06) um unique to secular humanism. As as Wilson said, the churches had disagreements and stuff. The difference

(2:16:12) is that secular humanism doesn't take their word as a an un unchanging

(2:16:17) authority that must be obeyed and that's why they can get along a lot better. That's true. They take their own word as

(2:16:23) an unchanging authority which must be obeyed which is why he doesn't have a stance independent reason for anything

(2:16:28) he believes. It's not unchanging if I find out. Well no if you're the ultimate arbiter being then I can change my stance on

(2:16:35) that then becomes what's moral right. Mhm. Chad says L. James thank you for that.

(2:16:42) Gary Newman says the standard for human health definitely doesn't change right.

(2:16:49) I think they're saying the standard for human health. Yeah, it does change. Yeah, we find out more stuff. But that's better than saying,

(2:16:56) "Hey, what I've got in this book from millennium ago is is the unchanging word and nothing will ever change and it's

(2:17:02) it's forever this thing." No, there's stuff in there. There's stuff in there about breeding striped goats by making

(2:17:09) them look at striped sticks. I mean, can we please move into the current century, please?

(2:17:14) Yeah. I mean, this is what's so funny, though. Mark says that no, there's no unchanging standard in secular humanism

(2:17:22) because he can change his mind. Not realizing he's still saying he's the with no stance independent reason. He's

(2:17:28) still the unchanging standard. Doesn't matter if you can change your mind. You're still the standard of everything

(2:17:33) that is moral. Mark, you're God in this scenario. All you've done is defer

(2:17:38) morality from God to Mark. Mark's God. No, no, it's it's human wellbeing that

(2:17:44) is the standard. this one. Okay, you're wrong. Appreciate this one coming in from Vincent Desashis says, "Mark, the point

(2:17:51) is Andrew is doing an internal critique of your position. You need to explain your contradiction of the non-violence

(2:17:58) principle and your use of force to stop incestuous relationships."

(2:18:04) Yeah. Well, I I did find a you know, there's multiple papers on why incestuous relationships are bad. I can send a few more through that show like

(2:18:11) sibling relationships are bad for psych psychological health as well. There are reasons why we do it and it is it is

(2:18:17) absolutely catastrophic. Um as Wilson admitted there are no people engaged in

(2:18:23) insensuous relationships that are mentally well like it is not something that to a healthy healthy human not from

(2:18:31) your view and this is backed up by the science and I can send another paper through but for some reason we want to split hairs here.

(2:18:36) First of all it was not backed up by the science. This isn't your time sir. This is not your time. I thought you were done. Shut

(2:18:42) up. Shut up. You should call me more often. Why are you lying? Cuz you know, you sound like you were trailing off.

(2:18:47) Wow. You are lying. Wow. Like you did with your paper that you sent me. Okay. Well, let me send you another one.

(2:18:53) Look, I just got a paper on Yeah. Okay. Keep sending it. Keep sending the papers. Unlike most your opponents, I

(2:19:00) actually read scientific papers. I enjoy reading them. And that's how I know you're always lying. You [ __ ] people lie to me

(2:19:06) constantly. Let's get You don't think I read papers? I don't think you read that one since it was about fathers and daughters. I'll

(2:19:12) give you a chance to look at those paper mark. Folks, if you if you haven't yet, hit that like button. We do appreciate it. I just flipped on that subscribers

(2:19:18) only chat mode. You don't want to miss it. As I had said earlier in the debate, these debates coming up bottom right of

(2:19:24) your screen. David Wood and Heiku debate in person in Ohio. And Andrew Wilson

(2:19:30) will be having a second outnumbered series, Andrew Wilson versus Five. That

(2:19:35) will be released on Modern Day Debate soon as well. Hit that subscribe button as we have many debates coming out in

(2:19:41) the future. This one coming in from Petara says, "Truth is, you cannot prove

(2:19:47) God exists, nor can you disprove it. It's even harder to prove the Bible is correct. No proof of the Exodus of 2

(2:19:53) million people from Egypt, nor of their 40-year trip, and much more."

(2:20:02) Okay, fascinating. Kaboo says, "Doing good, Andrew." Jordan Lafrren says, "Mark, isn't it isn't that

(2:20:09) complicated? Why ought we pursue human well-being? Why ought humanity exist?

(2:20:15) Why ought we have society? You're assuming those are goals we ought to pursue, but we have no reason why in all

(2:20:23) caps. Well, yeah, I I sort of went into it in my introduction that we are a social

(2:20:28) animal. We, you know, you put a human by themselves, they don't do particularly well for an extended period of time. We

(2:20:34) are rely on social bonds and there's a lot of evolutionary factors of why that is. um we're not a um sort of a a you

(2:20:43) know solo hunter or anything like that. We are a social species. But why ought

(2:20:48) people care for this? Well, a lot of people agree that they feel better

(2:20:53) living in a productive happy society. Um now that

(2:20:59) that's still a stance. I acknowledge that's still a stance, but it is a commonality that people can agree on and

(2:21:05) then construct societies around. um this isn't difficult unless they decide to disagree about it

(2:21:11) which they have done for I don't know all of human history and they create their own societies with their own

(2:21:16) traditions with their own people groups with their own cultures and they reject things that they don't like which interfere with those people groups

(2:21:22) traditions and cultures and then they end up going to war with each other and killing each other because they don't agree on these arbitrary metrics at all

(2:21:28) and all Mark is giving you is based on Mark's stance dependent reason you should do what [ __ ] Mark says he's

(2:21:33) the unchanging standard of all universal morality and that's why Andrew Wilson rejects that because I'm not [ __ ]

(2:21:40) stupid. Unlike well you are unlike my opponenting my position. That is your position reduced. You just

(2:21:47) don't understand it because you're not smart enough. It was up to me and my stance. That's not what I said. I didn't infer

(2:21:52) anything. I didn't say it was up to you. And when there has been tribal Can I please speak? Can I please speak or

(2:21:57) Mark? Yell louder. Yell louder. Mark, yell out. Are you going to just talk over the top of me? You got no respect. Mark, we're having a discussion. Sorry.

(2:22:04) So the reason why is because yeah you get this tribalism and tribes doing this basically we basically just move into

(2:22:10) bigger and bigger societies. At one point countries didn't exist and then we all worked together and made a productive country. We can work together

(2:22:17) with other countries but Andrew is a nationalist and doesn't like other countries and you know other people's

(2:22:22) that's fine he can have that. Me I would like a world that works productively to

(2:22:28) for the benefit of all and I'm sorry that offends you Andrew. So Mark actually look at this a point of

(2:22:34) agreement. I also would like that world but understanding how different humans

(2:22:40) are from each other with their cultures, traditions, environments, the various things that they want, don't want,

(2:22:45) accept as harm, accept as good. I understand that what you are doing is trying to slingshot us with a confetti

(2:22:51) gun towards just your own preferences, which you would try literally to get rid

(2:22:57) of me if you could if you thought I would become a dictator of the United States and impose my preferences. But

(2:23:03) honestly, Mark, that's actually what you're doing. You're just trying to impose your preferences on everybody

(2:23:09) else by saying you're all [ __ ] wrong and me, Mark, I'm right. The unilateral ruler of all of morality, Mark, is

(2:23:16) correct. I didn't I didn't say that I enforce my will give me a stance independent

(2:23:22) humanism is not enforced. I said it is a philosophy that people can choose to follow if they want a better world. So I

(2:23:28) never said anything about enforcement. It's Andrew that wants to basically put people lock them up if they can't have

(2:23:33) policy without preferences and what he thinks is is correct. Um there are certain things that are so harmful

(2:23:39) towards others that we have to stop them. But we want to help those people um work with us. And the whole point is

(2:23:46) and this is just a [ __ ] dodge. Like seriously, we want to work towards the betterment of all. And you know, Andrew

(2:23:52) is just misrepresenting what we actually believe, which isn't surprising really. Yeah. But here's the thing.

(2:23:58) Can we move on or does Andrew have a Well, you were done talking, dude. Why? I can't even respond.

(2:24:03) Yeah, but you're starting another debate. The question is starting another debate. You want to have the last You're

(2:24:09) not getting it. You're not getting it. You're not going to get it. Got to go to the next one. Sunflower said Mark uh they said you had lied.

(2:24:18) They said the New Jersey public schools were covering for and moving the teachers around to different schools so

(2:24:24) they could stay as teachers probably. I think they're talking about like an old union. Then then then that school and

(2:24:32) all of those schools involved should be shut down, closed up, lit on fire and they should be absolutely cleaned out of

(2:24:38) anybody that was involved in it and and the institutions shut down. That doesn't mean we shut down all education

(2:24:45) everywhere because people haven't done that. But absolutely they should be shut down. So things like the Catholic

(2:24:51) Church, Greek Eastern Orthodox Church, they should be shut down for what they have done. But you see how that makes no sense. He

(2:24:57) says these individual parts which are part of the whole institution [ __ ] up. Therefore, the whole institution shouldn't be shut down, just those

(2:25:03) parts. When he moves over to the Catholic Church or Eastern Orthodoxy, he makes the claim the entirety of the churches should be shut down, not just

(2:25:10) the parts that are [ __ ] up. You can depose a pope. You can uh you can remove, especially in Orthodoxy, corrupt

(2:25:16) bishops. We've done it all throughout our entire the entirety of our history. in corrupt churches. Mark, why would we

(2:25:22) shut the entire Orthodox church down because one Orthodox church did a bad thing under a bad bishop when we have

(2:25:29) the power to remove them, Mark? Just like you would with the school. Can you explain that?

(2:25:34) Well, then there I don't know about removal, but there's certainly been no like the pope wasn't deposed. He wasn't

(2:25:40) removed for the things that Catholicis locked them up at all even though they'd broken the law and they didn't they

(2:25:48) didn't lock up any of the orthodox church. They just sort of said, "Hey, we're going to do better with these

(2:25:54) massive things to the state, not to the church who gets locked up." Mark,

(2:26:01) yeah, you heard what I just said. It's up to the state to lock people up, not the church. Agree or disagree? Just a

(2:26:06) coincidence that they never press charges against these Orthodox priests. Oh, wait. You're saying that the Orthodox Church runs the states that

(2:26:13) they're in? No, I'm saying that they have an undue amount of influence over the state, right? So powerful people who are

(2:26:19) engaged in PDF file activity try to cover up their track. That's crazy, Mark. It's almost like that's exactly

(2:26:25) what I've been saying over and over and over. Well, do you do you support releasing the Epstein files?

(2:26:31) Yes. Yeah, I do, too. That's another point of agreement. Whoever is involved in that, it should be revealed, prosecuted, shut

(2:26:38) down. Absolutely. Next one. Here we go. This next one from Hall Long Nate says, "Under secular

(2:26:43) humanism, is there anything that is universally unacceptable besides religion?" Mark,

(2:26:49) is there any I don't think religion is universally unacceptable? I don't like where do you get that from? I think that

(2:26:56) some religions are better and some are worse. I mean, nobody's going to question that there are religions which generally are good for society. you know

(2:27:02) they don't do much harm and then there is you know religions which cults that

(2:27:07) kill people you know I mean come on there's a mass spectrum of what is good and what is bad so it's not bird 2248

(2:27:13) says arise from goals if we value life survival or flourishing then pursuing well-being in society logically follows

(2:27:20) as the means to those ends uh no that doesn't logically follow

(2:27:26) so just saying just saying a thing logically follows doesn't mean that it does and by the way You can even create

(2:27:32) things which logically follow would have false conclusions. But in this case, it doesn't even logically follow that if

(2:27:38) it's the case. Uh we should logically follows that pursuing a goal gets you to

(2:27:43) the goal. Uh well, no. You can get to a goal without pursuing a goal. You agree,

(2:27:48) right? Do you agree that pursuing a goal will logically get you closer to that goal?

(2:27:54) Not necessarily. If you can get to the goal without pursuing the goal, which you can. So you think it's better to not

(2:28:01) pursue a goal? No, I didn't say better goal. I said logically follows, stupid. Follow what I'm saying. Yes. Do you understand? Logically follows

(2:28:07) that if you pursue a goal, you'll get closer to the goal. You don't pursue the goal. And can you get closer to goals by not

(2:28:14) following goals in some instances? Like when like whenever. Is there any instance

(2:28:19) where you can get closer to a goal you have by not following it? Even by sheer coincidence? That is possible, right?

(2:28:26) It's possible. Then it doesn't logically follow, does it? [ __ ] doesn't. That's what logically following means. Now, if

(2:28:32) you said, if you were to rephrase this and say, now Andrew, doesn't it logically follow that most of

(2:28:38) the time when you try to pursue a goal that you will achieve that goal? Doesn't it logically follow to do if if X then

(2:28:46) Y, then I would say sure. But you didn't say that, did you? That isn't the question. Yeah, I know. says, "Why is that?" It doesn't logically follow.

(2:28:52) It logically follows that if you want to get closer to a goal, you should pursue that.

(2:28:57) Mark, it doesn't logically follow. I just demonstrated it for you, Mark. I'm sorry you don't know logic, but

(2:29:03) that's how logic works. This one from Toby Walker says 72 replacement rate is very simple math.

(2:29:10) Given 10 generations, South Korea would have a population of zero. I know. said, "Is it normal for secular

(2:29:17) humanists to deny math?" Yeah, that that's basically a the slippery slope because you're assuming

(2:29:23) that the population decline is going to continue continue steadily for all that time, which you don't know that and

(2:29:29) nobody knows that. And and the whole thing is that also rules out anything like immigration, anything like um

(2:29:36) other, you know, trying to address the problem. it rules out, you know, you're you're basically saying, hey, if if the

(2:29:42) population keeps declining as it is, if there's no change, if everybody also decides not to have children, then it's

(2:29:48) going to reach zero. There's a lot of ifs there. That's exactly what a slippery slope is. It's basically

(2:29:53) saying, hey, I know the outcomes of all these steps, and I'm going to assume that they are all true. There is no

(2:29:59) reason to think that it's going to drop to zero. Like, actually, there's a lot of reason to think this. And the thing is is that

(2:30:05) while Mark I will grant to Mark he's right in one sense that it is the case

(2:30:11) that if you say um well it's 100% a sure thing but we could use that argument for

(2:30:17) everything. It's not 100% sure that even if my bathtub fell through the floor that it wouldn't turn into a balloon and

(2:30:23) float off for 100% shity. Right? That's unfortunately the way the statistics

(2:30:29) work. But here's the thing. We can map this from the year 1800 when we started

(2:30:34) tracking these things to now and it does this. No reason. Hang on there. Hang on. Mark,

(2:30:40) let me finish. Mark, let me finish. Well, the question was for me. Mark, did I let you finish? Did I let you finish? I guess you did. But let me

(2:30:46) do I get the final word. Let me Yeah, I'll give you the final word, but let me finish. Thank you. It's gone from the 1800s like this. It's

(2:30:53) dropped everywhere like a [ __ ] rock. The only time was during the baby boom.

(2:30:59) that was the only time and there was really small set conditionals and that was only for certain places like the US.

(2:31:06) So yeah, we have great reason to believe that it's not going to reverse. In fact, the governments of these various

(2:31:12) countries have told us with their scientists that Mark loves so much that it's likely not going to reverse. So

(2:31:19) Mark's actually the science denier here, not you chatter. Yeah. So this population it it's

(2:31:25) correlation does not equal causation. And we see this within all sort of um first world countries as the sort of

(2:31:31) rates of raising children actually gets higher. Um there's no reason to think it is actually going to continue forever

(2:31:38) until it hits zero. And I think that we should wait to see what actually happens. And hey, if we need to

(2:31:43) implement some things to encourage people to have more babies, like for instance, offsetting the insane cost of

(2:31:50) living that's there at the moment, that would help a lot because a lot of people choose not to have children because of

(2:31:55) the cost of living. And a aie says, Batu Sai says, "Mark saying human

(2:32:02) well-being is making up human well-being. How do you know the best

(2:32:08) well-being isn't to maximize the well-being of trees over humans?

(2:32:14) Well, if if that was the I believe that, I'd be a secular treeist. And yeah, it's

(2:32:20) it is subjective. The reason why I care about humans is because I'm a human and not a tree.

(2:32:26) This one coming in from Tuch says, "Mark, are you related to Jake? You look like his older brother,

(2:32:32) perhaps maybe a cousin." Who's Jake? I I don't know who Jake is. Vincent says, "Again, get Mark to

(2:32:38) clarify his contradiction on nonviolence principle and his call to stop incest relationships." So, okay, I think they

(2:32:46) want a clarification. So, you'd be like okay with the brothers making uh having

(2:32:52) relations like you wouldn't be ethically okay. You'd at least allow it. You wouldn't

(2:32:58) lock it up. Well, the the problem is that um there's a there's a sort of problems with

(2:33:04) coercion, problems with all kinds of things in this stuff and that's what I'm sort of pointing to in the studies that you get people in these things and

(2:33:11) mentally they are not well. So like a lot of people with mental health concerns if you know they're doing real

(2:33:17) harm, we do have to put them somewhere, but it's not to punish them. It's to try and treat whatever thing that they're

(2:33:23) going through. That's how we address mental health concerns. Not like locking them up in a prison where they're just

(2:33:29) going to get worse treatment and then they're going to do worse things when they get out. We've got to help people, not not, you know,

(2:33:37) Toot says, "Mark, oh, we got that one. Bubblegum gun, was Jesus wrong for making the age of marriage 12?"

(2:33:45) Yes. Is that Do you have a stance independent reason for that?

(2:33:51) Yeah. Well, just based upon well-being, I don't know how marriage at 12 is good

(2:33:56) for the well-being of a child to answer that one. People ought not do do that, right?

(2:34:03) If they care about human well-being, does Jesus care about him? Is that is that is that a stance independent reason that you have for

(2:34:09) that? No. Okay. This one from Marilyn says, "Both of you

(2:34:16) have gatekeepers. Control and manipulation is basic forms of witchcraft." Pretty sure that's a bot.

(2:34:22) Miros 409 says, "So like teacher unions cover up abuse of children." Oh, we

(2:34:28) already covered that. Gabby says, "Mark, I take people for Mark says he takes people for what they say." Andrew says,

(2:34:34) "Okay, I'm a hippopotamus." But then Mark says, "Nuh-uh." Yeah. Well, I kind of take people's

(2:34:40) beliefs for what they say. It's not like sort of statements of fact. It is their beliefs. Um, so if somebody says, "Hey,

(2:34:45) I'm an atheist." I've got no way to check whether they're an atheist or not. If someone says, "Oh, I'm a Christian." I've got no way to check that. It's not

(2:34:52) like God's going to come down and tell me who's a Christian, who's not a Christian. And here's the funny thing. People Christians may go, "Hey, we're

(2:34:58) the real Christians and they're not." And they're saying the same thing from outsiders perspective. There's no way to

(2:35:03) tell. So I have no way to evaluate who's got the correct claim and who doesn't.

(2:35:08) So all I can do is just treat the person that says, "Hey, I'm a Christian." Well, that that is a Christian.

(2:35:13) Mark, I'm a billionaire. Do you believe me?

(2:35:19) No. I don't I don't understand though. You have no way to verify that. Oh, well, there's a lot of evidence to

(2:35:24) the contrary. You look [ __ ] terrible. What's it? Well, I don't understand. Billionaires can't look terrible.

(2:35:29) Yeah. No, it's just your entire set. I don't have the mentality for it. I just don't believe you. Oh, you don't believe me? I thought you

(2:35:35) just said that you believe everybody unless you can falsify the claim, which you can't. That's really weird, Mark. It's almost like you're a [ __ ] idiot.

(2:35:41) That's not what I said. That's not Yes, it is what you said. It's what you said. Yes, it is. Did I say Did I say I can't evaluate

(2:35:48) beliefs? Is you being a billionaire a belief? Yes, that would be a belief right now. It is. Okay.

(2:35:53) Yeah. So then you have to accept it, right? Wow. Okay. So the amount of money you

(2:35:58) have is just a belief. That's Well, from your perspective, wrong with you. So from your perspective, why don't you go out and spend the

(2:36:04) billions that you believe you have? Didn't you just say Didn't you just say you don't believe?

(2:36:10) Oh, no. No. I believe I've got a billion dollars. That's actual. You know, I Because I believe it, it must be. What

(2:36:15) is wrong with you? Seriously? I'm so I'm super curious. What do you have? How do you evaluate?

(2:36:21) How do you assess that someone believes? Yeah. Well, how do you evaluate what someone believes? That's a really good question, right?

(2:36:27) So, like if a guy, for instance, were to tell me that he was a woman, I would literally look at them and I would say,

(2:36:34) "Nah, you see, I have all of these great standards that I can apply to this and

(2:36:40) then I can falsify that stupid ass [ __ ] belief." Not you, though, Mark.

(2:36:45) You're obsessed with this. Um, no, that's just gender, which is the sort of secondary sex presented in the society.

(2:36:51) Um, that's not actually the sexes, which is what you're talking about. So, you know, that's completely different. And,

(2:36:57) you know, you love this topic. You just love it so much. You're obsessed. Proves that you're liars. Proves that

(2:37:02) you're liars. You're liars. You're all [ __ ] liars. You just shut up. You're a liar. You're a liar, man. You're You're an

(2:37:08) absolute liar. You wouldn't even be honest about your own beliefs. Can be men be women. Can be women dishonest. be

(2:37:16) women. Okay, we're going to jump to the next one. Funny Farm says, "I'd ask Mark a question, but he just mischaracterized

(2:37:22) and falsely equivocate in the name of philosophizing." Mark, I'll give you a chance to respond

(2:37:27) to that. Oh, sorry. I actually didn't mean you. Sorry about that. You're now you're

(2:37:32) unmuted. Yeah, apparently, you know, I'm not

(2:37:38) allowed to philosophize. Look, the everything really comes down to philosophy whenever you're talking about thinking about stuff. And you might not

(2:37:45) like the takes that I've got on things, but I certainly do answer honestly as I see them. And like Andrew, you can throw

(2:37:51) insults and go, "Oh, you're a [ __ ] You're an idiot. All this stuff." Yeah, but that is actually what I believe. So,

(2:37:56) you can throw all the insults you want. Look, I'll talk to you in your own language. Throw all the insults that you want. Here's my other cheek. How's that?

(2:38:04) I'll definitely uh to take the other cheek, too. The thing is is it's not an ad. Really, it's not an ad hom if it's true.

(2:38:11) Um, insults in debate are usually always ad homs because they're not just they're trying to categorize somebody and sort

(2:38:17) of it's almost like poisoning the world. I can address your argument character or attack them rather than the attacking

(2:38:23) the great I've arguments are always a logical fallacy. No, they're not always logical

(2:38:29) where you are presenting arguments. Although this would maybe not be categorized as a debate because I don't

(2:38:34) think Wilson's capable of debating which is funny because he runs a debate like teaching school. Then this is the best

(2:38:40) he can do. You should take it cuz you got worked. And here's the thing, dude. You don't even understand what fallacies

(2:38:47) debate. This is You don't even understand what fallacies are. This is Wilson having a tantrum.

(2:38:52) All right, we got to go to the next one. Early bird. Is that Do you have a stance independent reason for that? Early bird 2248 says you

(2:38:58) Yeah, it's objectively true. You're an idiot. It's objectively true now. Oh, that's a statement of fact. That's

(2:39:04) not a that's not a position on moral. I'm not saying you ought to be an idiot. I'd rather you ought not to be idiot.

(2:39:10) But you are an idiot. Oh, it's a state. It's a statement. I hate to do this, but early bird 2248

(2:39:15) says, "You first have to prove the Bible is truly God's word. Otherwise, you're just assuming your morals are divine, and you're stuck with the same

(2:39:21) foundation problem as everyone else." Andrew. Yeah. So, um, why do I need to do that?

(2:39:29) for the effects of the society of Christian or the effects of Christianity on society. Why do I need to do that?

(2:39:36) Can somebody actually explain that to me? Yeah. So, so it's because he's dodging foundations. He doesn't want to talk about foundations

(2:39:41) because is the debate about foundations? Dodging foundations. Is the debate about foundations? Oh, I talked about my foundations. It's

(2:39:48) you can't do the same. It's nice that you did that. Is is the debate about foundations? This one from Qatara says, "God ordered

(2:39:54) the unaliving of babies and toddlers." I think that's for you, Andrew.

(2:40:01) Uh, so do the secular progressives every single day. So I don't understand. They should say God's based.

(2:40:06) Toddlers really? Yeah. Every day. Yeah. Yeah. Toddlers. Really? Are you lying?

(2:40:11) Yeah. Well, if you kill So they un alive toddlers. Yeah. If you kill them if you kill them before they What's a toddler, Andrew? What's a

(2:40:18) toddler, Andrew? You. This one from Made by Jim Bob. So you just lie. Okay. Liar. Yeah.

(2:40:24) This one from Made by Jim Bob. Appreciate your question says Mark if assisted suicide is good to decrease

(2:40:32) suffering for some cases why isn't suic uh unaliving good for TRS folks doesn't

(2:40:41) it decrease suffering

(2:40:47) I asked you to let me try to ask you to unmute again yeah thank you um so the the problem is

(2:40:54) consent like with all the um assisted suicide and things like that. That's all right. Probably suicide. Um you you you

(2:41:01) have consent of that person and they are allowing to happen. That is a totally different story than taking away

(2:41:07) somebody's lie. That's I I don't know why that wouldn't be a distinction. Like

(2:41:12) why having consensual relations with with you know your wife is different than holding a woman down and doing

(2:41:19) horrible. Like I don't even get why that wouldn't be a distinction here. This one from AJ Anderson says, "Mark,

(2:41:26) rabbis happen to uh have their away with children at multiple times higher rates

(2:41:33) than priests. Should Jud Aism be shut down?"

(2:41:39) Well, I don't think that like a religion should be outlawed or anything like that, but I think that if certain temples have done it, that should be

(2:41:46) shut down. Absolutely. The institution should be shut down. um anybody that is doing that. But I also think there's

(2:41:52) another problem which is the circumcision of of children as well. I mean that is literally mutilation of a

(2:41:59) child. Oh yeah. Like you hear about the mutilation of children. By the way, the thing is so funny is now you've changed

(2:42:05) your answer. The Catholic Church should have been completely shut down. Synagogues. No, not so lot them though.

(2:42:11) Well, it depends. Is like do they have a central leader? Yeah. Well, yeah. But wait, I'm sorry.

(2:42:16) Who's a central leader? Central leader. If there's central leadership inside of orthodoxy and Orthodox Judaism and it

(2:42:23) turns out that they essay children at a higher rate than the Catholic Church, they should be shut down, right?

(2:42:28) Well, whoever is is like their church, if they've got a central leader that is committing it, then yes, if they've just

(2:42:34) got like temples that are doing it and that's as high as it goes, then those temples should be shut down.

(2:42:39) But but then why would you apply that to orthodoxy then, dummy? Well, if orthodoxy that church should be

(2:42:46) shut down, not the entire thing. That's not what you said. That's not what you said. No, I said that about the Catholic

(2:42:51) Church, you [ __ ] idiot. I said the Catholic Church where the Pope was involved. Was the Pope involved in

(2:42:57) cover-ups at that point? Is that Pope still there? Well, he died. He wasn't removed.

(2:43:02) So, he's not still there. What's the problem, Mark?

(2:43:08) He wasn't removed. He wasn't But he's not there now. Why would you shut it down now? The Pope. So

(2:43:14) Wilson's solution to abuse is wait for the person to die. No, Mark. Nothing we

(2:43:20) could do. Mark, do you want to do Mark? Do you want to shut them down? Monster down here.

(2:43:26) Would you like to shut them down? Listen to this monster. Would you like to shut the Pope who didn't have anything to do with the

(2:43:32) abuse down? What do you mean? Did I say would you Yeah, because that that's what

(2:43:39) I'm saying. It's the stupidest [ __ ] I ever heard. You want the Catholic Church church shut down because the pope, the

(2:43:45) previous pope who's not there anymore was engaged in this. But the current pope who's not, you still want the

(2:43:50) Catholic Church shut down. Do you realize how [ __ ] stupid that is? How long was that going on for under the

(2:43:56) pope's nose? Okay, bro. Do you want the Catholic Church shut down? Even though this I don't think the entire No, not the

(2:44:03) entire church. But those Now you just contradicted yourself again. You're like a walking contradiction, CQ

(2:44:10) ball. Okay, smoke pit. Say what you like. It's I will.

(2:44:16) Yeah, sure. Sure. Sure. Alcatraz gym. Like, go for it. Samar, that was even good.

(2:44:21) Sam, you're a [ __ ] idiot. Two seconds.

(2:44:27) Cancer sticks. Sam says, "Mark, what do you think of the argument that Christian moral

(2:44:33) undergirling is a useful necessary fiction? I'm an atheist, but I fear

(2:44:38) secular humanism running rampant more than Christianity. Thanks for your super chat, Summer.

(2:44:47) No, it's definitely not a undergirling that's necessary. We see a lot of secular societies, Japan, they have

(2:44:52) fantastic politeness. They're they're a good society. There's certain things about we wouldn't share with them culturally, but they didn't have

(2:44:59) Christianity. Um, you know, uh, uh, um, Ash Wednesday down here wants to sort of

(2:45:05) intimate that, no, Christianity is absolutely necessary and there's good things in Christianity. I will admit

(2:45:11) that, but we don't need it to be good people. Good people are good without Christianity. Don't need it at all.

(2:45:17) Oh, sorry about that, Andrew. Andrew's been on Wednesday wants to go. I just want to make sure. Um, there are

(2:45:24) really good people in that country where you can buy 13-year-old girls panties out of the [ __ ] vending machine,

(2:45:30) right, Mark? What's the age of marriage in some states, Wilson? Is it 13?

(2:45:35) And Christians want to remove that. They want to remove that. No, that the Christians put it there. What are you talking about?

(2:45:41) The Christians did. Yeah. Which state? The evangelical. The evangelical. You

(2:45:46) [ __ ] idiot. The evangelicals put it there. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's crazy. I could have sworn that the state took over marriage, Mark. Not the church.

(2:45:55) This the people that voted for it were evangelicals. Absolutely morons.

(2:46:00) So politicians who can who can unilaterally make policy after they're voted in could vote those policies.

(2:46:06) Okay. You don't know what that word means, do you? Yes. Yes, I do. Politicians can make

(2:46:12) those policies absent the consent of the very people who voted them in. So the

(2:46:17) state made it so that that was the policy, not the church, dummy.

(2:46:22) Yeah, in these Christian states. Congratulations. Oh, so then now they're Christian states,

(2:46:28) aren't they? They're majority Christian. So it's not a separation of church and state then. So this is the lies that are being told.

(2:46:34) Like it is these Christian politicians done, you know, voted for by Christian peoples, but suddenly when they do

(2:46:41) something horrendous like lower the age of marriage, which they're stating is a Christian, one of their Christian

(2:46:46) values, oh, they're not Christians anymore. This is this is the Texas sharpshooter. You count all the things

(2:46:52) that Christianity has done right. And when when somebody does something wrong, oh, they're not Christian anymore. No, it's not with us. That's somebody else.

(2:46:58) That is somebody else. No. No. That's Christians that did that. Absolutely.

(2:47:03) Now, this one coming in from do appreciate it. According to John says, so according to Mark, the Catholic

(2:47:08) Church should be persecuted. Yet, he complained about Christians. Complain about things Christians have done in the

(2:47:14) past. Yes, I've complained about things Christians have done in the past. Yes, I

(2:47:21) think that is a pattern of enforcing their religion upon others and you know holy wars, crusades, witch burnings, all

(2:47:27) of this kind of stuff. Um, none of that happened because they believed in the well-being of people. They believed in

(2:47:33) the divinity of God. Especially things like doctrine of discovery where they basically went to a country and if the

(2:47:39) people there weren't Christian, nobody lived there. That was their estimation. There weren't people unless they were

(2:47:44) Christian. Look, like the United States. Yeah.

(2:47:50) So our founders were a bunch of [ __ ] bigoted pieces of [ __ ] and you you don't like them, right?

(2:47:57) What do you mean? Well, you don't like our founders. I mean, they they didn't want like all those enlightenment people like John

(2:48:03) Lockach who said that you really can't govern without being Christian. He wanted laws where you had to be a

(2:48:09) Christian to even govern. John Lockach was a real piece of [ __ ] wasn't he? No, he had some good ideas. He had some

(2:48:15) bad ideas. I'm not judging like Hitler. Did you say that Hitler had some good ideas? Excuse me, I'm answering. Um, I'm

(2:48:22) judging the doctrine of the church. These guys have had a couple of thousand years and you sort of, oh, we got it

(2:48:27) right morally. That the the Christians have been kicked d screaming and kicking into currently, you know, some sort of

(2:48:34) moral semblance of of acceptability by people all this time. That's why people are leaving the churches in droves.

(2:48:40) Their ideas are horrible and they have been horrible for quite some time. And this is the people, I might add, that

(2:48:46) claim to have a direct line to the moral master of the universe.

(2:48:52) How? Wow. Good news. Okay, two seconds. Andrew

(2:48:57) wants to say something. But first, folks, thanks so much for those of you who have donated to GoFundMe so far. We

(2:49:03) just went up 2% during the stream. So, thank you very much for those donations. That's for our camera lenses, which will

(2:49:09) be used for these upcoming Inerson debates, including the one that you can see, for example. on the bottom right of

(2:49:15) your screen right now. Destiny, which August 5th, if you want to debate him in Los Angeles, shoot me an email at

(2:49:21) moderndaydebate@gmail.com. Or if you're in the Chicago area, you want to debate Andrew on August 8th. As

(2:49:27) you can see at the bottom right of your screen, that's what we're using these lenses for. We are going to bring

(2:49:33) in-person debates back into the spotlight and we're going to make them great again. With that, Andrew, I think

(2:49:38) you had something you wanted to say. Mark's face. I love you guys. Sorry.

(2:49:43) Go ahead. Well, I was just saying access to the ultimate arbiter would just be Mark. So,

(2:49:51) I don't even know what the problem is. It's just Mark is the ultimate arbiter. No stance independent reasons. He's the

(2:49:56) ultimate arbiter. Nice straw man. You got some more. It's not a straw man. It's just that's

(2:50:02) kept saying that I am not the ultimate arbiter because um I don't choose what human well-being is, whether it exists.

(2:50:08) I don't make it up. I just choose that that makes me But you do get to choose it. You do get

(2:50:14) to choose ultimately though which as you think people ought follow. And if they're not following those as they have

(2:50:20) to be immoral, right? Yeah. That's what everybody does.

(2:50:25) Okay, great. Then you're the ultimate arbit. Do you choose to follow God?

(2:50:30) Oh, sure. Absolutely. Then you're the ultimate arbiter. Wow. Wouldn't that be God would be the ultimate arbiter?

(2:50:36) I'm sorry. Could you have to follow him? Well, I'm sorry, but even if I chose to follow him, wouldn't I still be

(2:50:43) conditioning that he's the ultimate orbiter like you're doing with these scientists?

(2:50:49) Then that's still not me. Okay. Oh, I'm sorry. You're predicting yourself. You're So wait, so wait, then it's delusional

(2:50:54) when I do it, not delusional when you do it. Well, I'm pretty sure that scientists and the entire knowledge of human

(2:51:00) history up to this point does exist. That's scientists have the entire knowledge of human history, do they?

(2:51:07) Yeah, pretty much. What do you think we got rid of? Are you an ancient [ __ ] are you talking about,

(2:51:13) bro? Are you an ancient technology guy? What What does it have to do with anything?

(2:51:19) Okay, so what what scientist

(2:51:25) human history? What What access to human knowledge has the church has done in the last 2,000

(2:51:32) years that we can confirm is true? What do you mean? What what contribution

(2:51:38) have churches made to the collection of human knowledge about the world around

(2:51:43) us that we can confirm is true that the churches the people with the direct line

(2:51:48) to the omnisient master of everything how what have they contributed to human knowledge over the last

(2:51:53) that's a great question so I would point out yeah so I would point out that unlike you stupid ass materialists the

(2:52:00) church actually took Aristotle especially the Catholic church took arisatilian thinking and they were able

(2:52:07) to actually show us when you're talking about things which stay in stasis in a state of decay. When the dumbass

(2:52:13) continental philosophers came along and said, "No, no, no. It's all about materialism." The church actually

(2:52:18) allowed us to give an accounting for transcendental categories that you dumb [ __ ] can't give us.

(2:52:24) We'll jump to the next one. Did you hear what I just said? Give us an accounting. We can't confirm that, you [ __ ]

(2:52:30) You can't confirm what? Transcendental. How do you know? The thing that you're talking about, the static thing that

(2:52:36) you're talking about. Where is it? Show it to me. Wait, I'm sorry. Show me empiricism.

(2:52:41) Show me show empiricism. Show me empiricism. My work. My senses. Oh, your census work. Oh, okay. That

(2:52:48) That's empiricism. So, we've contributed empiricism dummy all kinds of medicine.

(2:52:56) The only reason the only reason that Wilson and I can talk right now is by using light provided by science. And he

(2:53:03) goes, "Oh, some transcendental some created by God." And then if that's

(2:53:09) created by God, then suddenly we've contributed to human knowledge. They haven't contributed anything. You can't

(2:53:15) even account for human knowledge. Posters, your your house that you live in, all of that was science, testing,

(2:53:22) making things, engineering. Oh, you contributed wine. We didn't know what a cup was before the

(2:53:28) scientific method came along. This was empiricism. What a [ __ ] Oh, really? So, so is your church going

(2:53:33) to is your church going to contribute to maybe um computer technology or you know you're currently using it to communicate

(2:53:40) with me. Is that something they're going to contribute to? Well, yeah. Actually, the church does contribute to technological progress.

(2:53:47) Yes. Well, you see, you see, if it is the case, for instance, that the church were able to No, no, just tell me what it contributes

(2:53:53) to. Great. So since the church, since the church gives us odds for things like family, reproduction, things like this,

(2:53:59) it actually pinions men into the idea of being involved in higher in higher

(2:54:04) callings and sciences. And here's the thing that's so funny. Here's how my demonstration. Yeah, here's my demonstration.

(2:54:10) What motivates people? What the hell? Most scientists What do you motivate people? What do you motivate people to

(2:54:16) do? Work together and live in a healthy, happy society. Oh, based on your own personal preferences. Brilliant.

(2:54:22) Yeah. Brilliant. Uh-huh. Well, then I'll just do the same thing. Who wants a healthy, happy society? I'll just do the same thing. You know

(2:54:28) what the healthy happy society though? Forgive me, guys. Kevin Blackwell says, "Mark just said that Stephven Hawking

(2:54:35) has given the world non-physical benefits. Does that necessarily mean

(2:54:40) there is more than the physical? And can you use a scientific method to prove that?"

(2:54:47) Well, I I don't think I said non-physical benefits. I think I just said it it had benefited society from

(2:54:52) his knowledge and yeah I mean people have benefit like contributed ideas and

(2:54:58) have benefited but um you know you've got to in some way confirm them and applying a practicality to it is is

(2:55:05) probably a good idea so we can actually implement it in a way that can help us because if you have some sort of

(2:55:10) philosophical concept that you can go oh well I presuppose God therefore everything therefore science it doesn't

(2:55:17) actually help us with anything. This one from one shot. Hang on. Can science confirm philosophy?

(2:55:26) Can science confirm a study? A study? Yeah, philosophy is the study as a study

(2:55:33) like it. Can science confirm philosophy? Can science confirm philosophy? Probably

(2:55:39) not. I don't know what. Then why are you using it? Science is philosophy. Then why are you

(2:55:45) using it? Methodological naturalism. So science is philosophy. Science is philosophy. Then if the

(2:55:52) church gives us philosophy, it's science, isn't it, idiot? Well, it doesn't give us philosophical

(2:55:58) natural. Oh, it doesn't give us philos really Aquinus. Yeah. No, these weren't philosophers that didn't revolutionize

(2:56:04) how philosophy was looked at. Really? Uh, yeah. So, they might have like

(2:56:10) philosophy may have its grounds. A number of Christians have contributed a number of atheists as well. I mean, you

(2:56:16) pointed out Hume um point out and Hume was building off of

(2:56:22) Carl Pa and who were they building off of? You're just pointing out the history of human knowledge as the building of

(2:56:28) previous people and you've pointed out Aristotle who wasn't a Christian.

(2:56:33) This one from Adrius Makivius says, "So the whole UK government must be locked

(2:56:41) because they covered groom gangs. doesn't by Mark's standard giving

(2:56:47) children to PDF files to avoid Nazi

(2:56:52) ism is leading to harm reduction. So is moral.

(2:56:57) I don't know what that meant. Folks, you can always put a donation to the GoFundMe, even if it's just five bucks,

(2:57:03) and then you can put as long of a message as you want if you just tag me because I don't know what you just said. Uh, this one from Jojo Siwa. You guys

(2:57:11) sound like two drunk dads at a baseball game. Scabby says, "Someone please check Mark's search history." Wow.

(2:57:20) According to You can if you want. I've got what Andrew wants to talk. I mean, I'm not the one saying up to me.

(2:57:29) Has nothing to do with Mark. Has nothing to do with Mark. I just wanted to point out that I have many

(2:57:34) critics in the MDD audience and I understand that all of you are [ __ ] stupid. I've never liked the MDD

(2:57:41) audience. I've always thought all of you were [ __ ] stupid. I've always thought that. I'm just saying.

(2:57:46) Oh, I don't know. I think they're biased. I wouldn't say. Okay. No, stupid. They know it, too. Like,

(2:57:52) they'll be the first. I bet you that James' chat right now would be like, "Yeah, there's a lot of [ __ ] stupid people here." I bet you anything.

(2:57:58) To be fair, most of them in chat seem to be on your side, Andrew. But this one from Jojo Siwa says, "You we got that

(2:58:05) one. Elborne Animal says, "Progressives in modern western society try to stand

(2:58:10) in the place of God and make up morality up for themselves and their actions are the cause of the major problems in

(2:58:16) society such as Only Fans, etc." Mark, what are your thoughts? Are you a fan of

(2:58:21) Only Fans? I I don't think I don't think, you know, if you're if you're I don't think Only Fans is a major problem in society. I

(2:58:27) think things like nuclear war and chemical war and biological web, that's a lot more dangerous. AI is a problem

(2:58:32) that we've got to address. um automation, robotics, you know, there's a there's a million problems to address.

(2:58:39) Now, do I think that Only Fans has some problems that it needs to remedy? Absolutely. There should be accountability. There should be a lot

(2:58:44) more oversight of it. But I don't think it's like the huge destruction of society like the church keeps telling

(2:58:50) you it is because um it society will go on fine. I don't see the problem.

(2:58:56) This one from Evangelist says, "I don't believe for a minute Mark is an atheist. None of his beliefs have anything to do

(2:59:02) with atheism. Uh, atheism is a pos is a a a position

(2:59:08) position. It it's just basically whether you believe in a god or you don't believe in

(2:59:13) a god. It's not, you know, when you expect somebody who's an atheist to have other beliefs, they'll be drawn from

(2:59:19) elsewhere because atheists just don't believe that a god exists. I could be a hedenist who thinks goes for my own

(2:59:24) pleasure. I'm not. I could be a nihilist that thinks believes in nothing but I'm not. Right? They're all atheists. I

(2:59:31) can't believe I can't actually believe how Mark just got done telling us all this problem

(2:59:36) that science, the methodology that he loves so much, brought us problems of nuclear war and robots and AI and all

(2:59:44) these problems without ever thinking for a second whether or not we ought. I

(2:59:50) wonder what we could turn to that has thousands of years of studying whether we should or shouldn't do a thing. What

(2:59:57) could we possibly do to temper scientific pursuits? What organizations

(3:00:02) could we appeal to for that, do you think, Mark? Yeah. Well, old man Winter isn't listening because they clearly said

(3:00:08) that, hey, science is best for telling us facts about the world, but it doesn't tell us what we ought to do. And I might

(3:00:13) add that, you know, Wilson wants to point out this whole history of Christianity. It was also Christians

(3:00:18) that actually decided how they ought to implement them as well. Yeah, that's right. But Mark, this just

(3:00:25) you didn't actually answer my question. I'll just ask again. What? What organizations with thousands of years of

(3:00:31) history diving into what people ought to do and ought not to do could we turn to if science starts to give us things

(3:00:38) which could, you know, destroy all of humanity like the nuclear bomb to kind of rein us back in to tell us maybe

(3:00:46) there's some things in science we shouldn't pursue that are stance independent. What could you turn to for

(3:00:52) that, Mark? Well, I wouldn't turn to religion because basically they will have problems with other religions and

(3:00:58) use said things because they think it's important to make their their god correct than to actually um use it in a

(3:01:06) way that helps people. And that's why secular humanism is better because religious people are going to kill an

(3:01:12) entire bunch of people over in the Middle East because my god doesn't like them. I can go well all humans. No,

(3:01:20) you'll just kill them because you don't like their god. Thank you. just kill cuz you don't like this is uh from Austin Cameron says Mark

(3:01:26) is a supremacist who endorses child genital mutilation and enslaving via

(3:01:33) hormone subscription services. He worships arguments of authority by faith. Did we discover math or invent it

(3:01:40) Mark? Okay, so you we invented math for a

(3:01:45) start. um you basically have to um you have to straw man the hell out of me.

(3:01:52) And throwing these accusations doesn't make you look clever. It doesn't make you look cool. It just means that other

(3:01:57) Christians are going to look at you and go, "Hey, you're bearing false witness and you're looking really unconvincing."

(3:02:02) And a lot of people will move away from Christianity because of the example that you're setting. Like there's a reason

(3:02:08) why under 1 Peter 3:15 there is an obligation to do so with kindness and gentleness because this makes people go

(3:02:15) that's horrific and I want you to understand that this is the reason why your churches are failing. Understand

(3:02:21) it. This one coming in from do appreciate it. Crimson King says skid Mark I think

(3:02:29) that they're referencing like good. I like that. That's good. Scabby McGabverson says, James says, "Mark, can

(3:02:36) we kill mentally disabled children in the womb?" Mark says, "Yeah, there's

(3:02:42) enough of us already." My guess is you think that's a straw man. Mark, what are your thoughts? Oh, absolutely. Yeah. No, I didn't say

(3:02:48) that. Um, but you know, I do support that I shouldn't risk a woman's life and

(3:02:54) she has a right to bodily autonomy. Absolutely. But I think that there's a point at which you give her the option

(3:03:00) in the embryionic stage. And if she takes on the responsibility, then she needs to be held to that responsibility.

(3:03:07) Um, but I think before that point, um, you know, there should be an option for her to maintain her bodily autonomy. And

(3:03:14) I'm not I'm not thrilled about that. I just think that is the moral thing to do. If women collectively, since they

(3:03:21) have the rights over abortion and bodily autonomy, if they collectively decide in mass that they want to eliminate fetuses

(3:03:29) because they can scientifically determine if there's traits in those fetuses that they don't like, would you stop them, Mark?

(3:03:35) No. Okay. What do you mean? Fetus or an embryo? Fetus. Well, we should be able to tell from an

(3:03:42) embryo. All we need is like Yeah, but if it was we could only tell from a fetus.

(3:03:48) Um it depends how far along it is and you know I don't see 16 weeks

(3:03:53) well before it's conscious then yeah that's okay. Yeah it's okay. So if they just if they were just eliminating them based on the

(3:04:00) fact they didn't have blue eyes you don't have any problem with that. No okay

(3:04:05) one from one shot says people like Mark actually drive agnostic atheist fence

(3:04:11) sitters over to Christianity. He's too self-absorbed to realize how stupid his

(3:04:16) arguments and worldviews are once they get a proper interrogation by informed Christians. Mark,

(3:04:23) yeah, sure. Then you should be encouraging me, not not insulting me. You should be saying, "Hey, do more." It's really funny the gaslighting that I

(3:04:29) encounter off these people. They sort of say, "Hey, I was I was an atheist and then I became a Christian because of

(3:04:34) you." The funny thing is that the other people that do it are flat-earthers. They go, "Oh, well, I believed in the globe until I heard you." Like, dude,

(3:04:40) seriously, you think gaslighting is going to work? It's weird. Stop being weird, please.

(3:04:46) This one from do appreciate according to John says to say to Andrew, quote, "So

(3:04:51) Christian of you presupposes that in Christianity people are expected to behave well." That goes against your

(3:04:57) thesis though, Mark. Well, I'm simply taking the uh obligation under 1 Peter 3:15 that you

(3:05:04) should always take the opportunity to share your uh the reason for your faith with with other people, but do so in

(3:05:10) gentleness and kindness. Um, I do know a lot of Christians that find the way that

(3:05:15) uh Wilson and his followers handle themselves, they will rail against it as well. I think you may be hated just as

(3:05:21) much by a lot of Christians as atheists to be honest with you, Wilton. And you, I would I would say are just as

(3:05:27) hated by atheists as you are by Christians. Yeah, this one. Who knows? I don't really pay

(3:05:33) attention. Yeah, you are. So, I mean, what kind of crit all the criticisms you give me, you're guilty of the same one. Oh, what

(3:05:40) atheist what atheists hate me. The ones in the chat who said that they're atheists and they [ __ ] hate you. Those ones

(3:05:46) maybe. Easy. Speaking of Oh, yeah. The guy that Yeah, it's great.

(3:05:52) Says for Mark, would it be better if every human believed there was consequences for bad actions during your

(3:05:58) life or if everyone believed your actions on earth don't ultimately matter? Um, you know, there's always

(3:06:04) consequences for what you do. Our our choices will always lead to some kind of consequence in our life. And if you like

(3:06:11) really do things that are bad, you're going to end up with a really shitty life like Wilson. But if you actually

(3:06:16) like want a good life, we're proposing this philosophy to say, hey, how do we actually get to being a good and well

(3:06:23) life? Um, so the the idea that hey, because we've got an afterlife, the you

(3:06:29) know, it has consequences. Well, not necessarily. I could be the most awful person, repent on my deathbed, and get

(3:06:34) into heaven. It's there's nothing against that in the Christian faith. This one coming in from do appreciate

(3:06:40) it. Landon says, "Oh, let me unmute Andrew. I got you." If you've been

(3:06:46) just real quick, I've been I've been trying to mute myself, so I say just real quick. Mark, can you can you explain to the audience how my life is

(3:06:52) shitty? Uh, well, you generally hate a lot of people. You um seem to be yelling. I

(3:06:59) don't hate anybody. You've been yelling, Mark. Not me. Uh, you you have been yelling, Andrew.

(3:07:06) I'm not sure. No, you've been yelling, Mark. Not me. I haven't been yelling at all. Uh, yeah, you have. No, but you've been screaming, Mark.

(3:07:14) No, I've just been yelling to be screaming so loud and interrupting that I have to get what I have to scream

(3:07:20) because in a debate, what generally decent people do is they have an exchange of ideas and let each other

(3:07:25) talk. Yeah. Can you tell me how my life is terrible? You just interrupt people with a loud voice. Yeah. Can you tell me how my life is

(3:07:31) terrible, though, Mark? How's my life terrible? Uh, do you want me to go into it? Do you really want me to go into it? Are you

(3:07:36) sure? Yes. Are you sure? Yes. Um, do how many kids do you have?

(3:07:42) I have five. I have three three stepids and then I have two biological children. Really?

(3:07:50) You I'm sorry. A secular humanist against having stepchildren. No. Well, why would that be horrible then,

(3:07:56) Mark? Well, you you are a hatefilled bigot, Andrew. Well, I don't understand what that has

(3:08:02) to do with me having stepchildren. More. Well, look how mad you are. You're angry people just for simply living their

(3:08:07) life. I'm I'm confused though. How is it that me having children angry? And And can somebody explain how me having

(3:08:14) stepchildren from the secular humanist perspective means that I have a horrible life? Can you explain that to me, Mark?

(3:08:21) Well, it's not having stepchildren. It's basically having um I mean you champion

(3:08:27) this this nuclear family right with this you know you should stay with people notational things like that you should

(3:08:34) be have you know s sort of um a stable relationship where you don't swap partners and you don't have sex before

(3:08:41) marriage and you've done those things so if I was a drug addict I couldn't advocate against against doing drugs

(3:08:47) you say that people have a horrible life to have sex before marriage and all of these horrible things but you've done it

(3:08:52) self while they're doing you mean while they're doing those things. So if I said you're a drug addict and that's going to lead to a terrible life as long as

(3:08:58) you're on drugs and then when you stop doing drugs it'll be a less horrible life. You would agree, right?

(3:09:05) Yeah. Okay. Well then what the [ __ ] is your argument, dummy?

(3:09:11) Well, you're just a horrible person. Oh, you're just a horrible person. My argument is you're smoky man bad.

(3:09:19) Oh, that was fun, Mark. I appreciate that. This guy. Look at him. This one from Wow, dude.

(3:09:25) This one from You You obviously Look at you.

(3:09:30) Oh, wait. Hold on. This one from Red Fox

(3:09:35) says, "Mark, Andrew conceded his entire worldview in this debate. Why are you afraid to concede points? Do you see an

(3:09:41) obligation to listen to his points and reflect on how incoherent your worldview is or at least get better

(3:09:46) counterpoints?" No. No, it's not that. because I did concede points. I did say Christianity's

(3:09:52) done good things for the world. I've said all kind of conceding points that hey, they don't help my side. I

(3:09:57) certainly have done that. The problem is that um basically Andrew wants to go to the foundations of why I believe what I

(3:10:03) believe. Is it objective? Is it thing? But he wants to avoid at all cost saying what his foundations are and just say,

(3:10:09) well, it's just made up as well. It's just a trick. It's just I don't want to go to the foundations of my worldview.

(3:10:15) So, I'm going to make it all up. Lie to you. like the opposition just basically

(3:10:21) um misrepresent my own position and then claim hey I'm doing it for charity. It's not for charity. It's because he can't

(3:10:26) justify his own worldview. And that's why so I mean even if you made the concession of not being able to justify

(3:10:33) the thing and then you still couldn't demonstrate why the thing was bad. That's the most charitable way it could possibly be and negate your worldview at

(3:10:39) the same time. That's what makes it hilarious. I look even if I say I don't have a stance independent reason other

(3:10:44) than me that I'm just you that's what and you have no stance to like okay that

(3:10:51) may get you like you may put forward a dumbass argument as why secular humanism bad but it certainly doesn't project

(3:10:57) Christianity you've made no arguments for Christianity other than you think it's good

(3:11:02) congratulations says let's see if I think I lost this one

(3:11:08) Vincent uh is it Landon says move the goalposts Andrew clarified brothers quote unquote in zest from the very

(3:11:15) beginning. You aren't listening just losing your mind Mark. Could you repeat that?

(3:11:20) They said are you moving the goal or they're saying did Andrew move the goalpost and he said Andrew clarified

(3:11:26) brothers quote unquote in zest from the very beginning. You are not listening

(3:11:32) just losing your mind. I think it was about the incestuous brothers. Yeah, I I pulled up a thing on incest and it does,

(3:11:38) you know, sort of mention incest generally, but there's a ton of papers on this. This is one with a ton of research on it. So, you know, I can I

(3:11:45) can provide more, I can dump more. I did dump more. So, go for it. Trying to find out. And I've provided some evidence

(3:11:51) that incest is harmful for the psychology of people. If you want to provide opposite evidence, where's

(3:11:57) yours? Where's yours? The thing is is like the claimer who says it provides the

(3:12:03) evidence, not the person who asked the claimer. But here's the thing that's so interesting is that Mark lied to you and

(3:12:09) it just took me looking at his study to tell that he lied to you. So what he did is he said, "I have evidence incestuous

(3:12:14) relationships are bad." Okay, I think that that's a fair claim to make. So I pulled it up. Had nothing

(3:12:20) to do with the ancestous relationships. I asked him about had to do with fathers and daughters. And he was trying to make

(3:12:26) the claim the reason they're bad is because of the power dynamic. Well, yeah. Between fathers and daughters, that's going to be a way different power

(3:12:32) dynamic than between two twin brothers. And of course, he knows that. He lied to you because he didn't think I would

(3:12:38) check. And the thing is is like these [ __ ] dummies, they don't think I'll check. Mark, tell us what is the

(3:12:44) scientific method? Can you even tell us that? What is it? Can you even Can you list it? Tell us.

(3:12:49) Yeah, sure. It's a It's a series of methodologies that start with Do you want the steps? I just want the

(3:12:56) steps. What are the steps? Why are you Why do you do this? I just want the steps, bro. Someone's answering you and you

(3:13:01) interrupt them to tell me. Tell me the scientific method. I'm shutting up bad. Tell me this scientific method. So, it's basically um um observation

(3:13:10) questions, um hypothesis, testing.

(3:13:15) I'm going through it. What What are you doing? Well, I mean, I don't know. I It's just interesting asking.

(3:13:20) Oh, you don't know. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You're a [ __ ] idiot. You don't know. Okay. Okay. So the last step you just

(3:13:27) said what? Sorry. What's the last step? Publication peer review and then back to

(3:13:33) questions. And then those aren't necessary to the scientific method, Mark.

(3:13:38) Yeah, they so Okay, stop. Stop. It's a series of methodologies with the same overall

(3:13:45) system. I asked you about the scientific. So I thought you didn't know. Okay, so you're just being really really weird

(3:13:51) right now. So, I'm going to leave you there and really answer why. Um, basically, he just said it himself. He

(3:13:57) asked for evidence of incestuous relationships are bad and I provided it. Then he said, "I lied." He just said

(3:14:03) that. He just said that just then. I asked you about two brothers. That incestuous relationships are bad. That

(3:14:09) is what I provided. That's because you're trying to talk over the top. Um, could we mute him if I can't talk? I

(3:14:16) mean, seriously, what a douchebag. You are the worst. He's just screaming. We're going to go to the That's because

(3:14:21) I want to be heard over your fat [ __ ] face. That was mean, Mark. That hurt my feelings.

(3:14:27) Accurate though. We got this one. Scabby says, "I blame They say I blame the king of Australia,

(3:14:33) Jake, for this absolute intellectual abomination of a redacted Aussie." Oh, you mean Jake um from TV.

(3:14:41) Kevin Blackwell says, "I don't know who that is." Don't worry. The point is Kevin

(3:14:48) Blackwell says Mark said he uses the scientific method to find truth. He also

(3:14:53) said relationships exist. How did he use the scientific method to determine this?

(3:15:01) Um I I don't mean I use the scientific method for things that I do, but I'm not

(3:15:06) deciding everything myself. This is where it's a cooperative effort and you're trying to say, hey, you know, how

(3:15:12) did you do this? Um, we know that the scientific method works because we can do things with it. Like we've used it to

(3:15:18) say for instance, we can talk over the internet and you're seeing this right now because of scientific studies on how

(3:15:24) light works. And we're actually using that light to communicate me to you. You

(3:15:29) might not understand that if you know, you believe that a boat about 2,000 or 6,000 years ago did a did a surfing

(3:15:36) incident on a on a worldwide flood. But, you know, I I don't know how else you're

(3:15:41) supposed to prove that the scientific method works except that we manage to use it to do stuff. If you've got a

(3:15:46) better method, show it. Come forward with it. I think it's great. Well, the better meth method would be

(3:15:52) philosophy because you say that's all science is and so therefore I'm a scientist because I engage in philosophy. Right.

(3:15:57) I didn't say that to all. You literally said that. No, no, you're just straw maning. No, I mean literally that's what you

(3:16:03) said. I took notes. Can I please answer? Can I please answer? Um I said that one branch of

(3:16:08) science is um um philosophical uh uh uh uh methodological naturalism which is

(3:16:15) one branch of science. Doesn't mean that that's what it is. Like the straw mans are incredible. You are so dishonest.

(3:16:22) Get this dishonest Christian morality ladies and gentlemen. Christian morality. Yeah. And we'll just replay it back.

(3:16:29) We'll replay it back later. I don't know what to tell you. Uh uh just just just be be horrible. That's

(3:16:34) I don't know how many times you got to get wrecked on this one from I'm not your guy buddy

(3:16:39) says secularism is doomed to failure as secular women no longer care for the future and simply live in the present

(3:16:45) pursuing immediate gratification over long-term fulfillment. Heck they see babies as parasites. Give you a chance

(3:16:52) to respond Mark. Yeah I have no doubt that some women

(3:16:58) think that way but I wouldn't say the majority of them do. I think this is sort of, you know, incel kind of all

(3:17:03) women are this and that and you're painting with a really generalized brush over everybody. Um, a lot of a lot of

(3:17:10) women have a lot of different opinions. I don't think secular humanists believe that. And I don't know why you're

(3:17:15) suddenly deciding that you're going to speak for women. Oh, I forgot you're you're a Christian inel. Yeah. Sorry, I

(3:17:20) forgot. What? What am I talking about? Of course you got speak for women. Yeah, that's my that's my child in the woman

(3:17:25) though, right? That's her children that are in the woman. Can't they speak of the women for the women that aren't

(3:17:32) having babies? Andrew. Oh, you're a genius. You're you're just a genius. Why would women who aren't having babies

(3:17:37) have abortions? Stupid. The the the women that babies are are you're going to speak for them because it's

(3:17:44) your baby that she's not having. Wait, I don't I don't understand. That's bizarre to me. How How could it be

(3:17:50) possible that women aren't having babies? I've heard it. Are you just saying that women who aren't having babies aren't having them because

(3:17:56) they're aborting them? Is that what you're saying? I said that. Well, then I don't understand. What's your position here, dummy?

(3:18:04) You don't even know, do you? My position if there is no baby. There is no like you're not speaking for the

(3:18:10) women baby. So, they're speaking to women who get pregnant, which would be with their

(3:18:15) baby, doofus. Look, you absolute trollish monster.

(3:18:21) Like seriously, what are you doing? This one from You're pointing out how dumb you are.

(3:18:27) All right, prod five star says, "Mark, stop spuring, bro. Calm down." My guess is you would

(3:18:34) say you're not spuring. This one from early bird two. No, no. I'm just I'm just trying to make myself heard over somebody who has no

(3:18:42) like he doesn't have arguments. He just doesn't want people to hear mine. That's why he won't go to foundations. He won't

(3:18:48) explain anything. He won't do any of that. He just doesn't want you to hear other opinions. And this is high control

(3:18:54) behavior. Don't let them hear anything else. Just yell. Early bird 2248 says, "Like chess, once

(3:19:01) you accept the goal, checkmate, some moves are objectively better. In morality, if we value well-being,

(3:19:07) certain actions are objectively better, too." Andrew,

(3:19:16) what do you want me to unmute you or something? I could have sworn you unmuted yourself before. Do you know how to do that? Even

(3:19:22) though you're not supposed to be able to. He's too dumb. He can't work it out. He's not good with technology. Just Just leave him.

(3:19:27) I think he was earlier, I think. So So hang on. So if James mutes you, can you unmute yourself or are you too dumb?

(3:19:38) Nothing. No, you're just crickets. Crickets, bro.

(3:19:44) Yeah, I'm right. He can move. He didn't mute you. You had to unmute yourself. No, he he he did mute me. He

(3:19:49) had to click the unmute, dummy. You don't know what you're talking about again.

(3:19:55) You got something to say or is he just going to pass that one by? Yeah, he's got nothing to say. You're not even going to address the

(3:20:02) crickets. You're not even answering the question. Oh, wow. He's figured it out. He's figured it out. Don't look genius at work. He's He's thinking he's Wait,

(3:20:10) wait up. Go the brows. You seem very upset, Mark. Calm down. Let him answer. No, I'm not. I think it's I think it's

(3:20:16) horrendous. I thought you just got done saying that I did. That is the most ludicrous thing I've ever heard that you actually run a

(3:20:22) debate school cuz this isn't debate. This is you just being Well, I don't know, Mark. You lost. So,

(3:20:27) I guess you should weirdo. You weirdo. Oh, I lost.

(3:20:32) Is the guy in the debate? Yeah. Yeah. Look, I know when I lose. It just wasn't today. Okay. Wow. Manipulation as well to do this,

(3:20:39) guys. But Vincent says, "Mark, are you going to stop two people with Down syndrome from trying to have a child

(3:20:46) because they might have a kid with it, namely with Down syndrome?"

(3:20:51) Yeah, I I don't think so. Not necessarily. That that child may be absolutely fine. I think it should be not encouraged and they definitely

(3:20:57) should be educated on what their responsibilities would be if they did have that child. But I don't think

(3:21:02) necessarily that's the case. No. This one from Crew C. Bull says, "Mark, if Christians were starting to delete

(3:21:10) themselves after finding out God isn't real, would that be harm? Would you grant Christianity to prevent that harm?

(3:21:18) Would I grant Christianity?" No. I mean I can't change what I'm doing and my beliefs um you know for other people but

(3:21:26) at the same time um if there is harm I would certainly say hey maybe we can you

(3:21:32) know sort of allow you to have Christianity because here's the thing no one's saying that you've got to stop

(3:21:38) being a Christian and if you're unaware there are theistic humanists there's

(3:21:43) people who are Christian that agree hey human well-being is a good thing and we can work together perfectly fine it's

(3:21:49) monsters like Ash Wednesday down here that can't seem to work with anybody and that's reflected in his debates.

(3:22:01) Dr. Evo says, "Mark, I'm hearing an accent. Is that Papa New Guinea?"

(3:22:08) Uh, no. You're close though. Florence N. How close? How close? What do

(3:22:15) you mean how close? How close is he to the Papa New Guinea accent?

(3:22:20) for the accent or the place? The place. Sorry. Well, I'm not sure I can even explain it

(3:22:25) to you because you had the really small rodent. Yeah, he used really small words.

(3:22:31) Yeah. So, south of the hemis like the equator. Wait, are you a flat earther? Let's just assume I am.

(3:22:39) Okay. So, on your pizza shape um down on the side that Australia is, Papa New

(3:22:44) Guinea is to the north of that. And how close are you to that? Oh, thousands of miles.

(3:22:51) Oh, okay. This one from Do appreciate it, Monica. I'm not close. Anyway,

(3:22:57) Mark, if torturing one child ensured human well-being just because would it

(3:23:02) be right if human well-being justifies evil? The standard is broken. True morality protects the innocent, not the

(3:23:09) outcome. Yeah. No, I I don't think that sort of um violating a uh bodily autonomy and

(3:23:17) integrity uh for no reason whatsoever is is ever a good idea. Yeah. I I don't

(3:23:22) envision the situation where torturing a child would make society better. If somehow it could, but I'd love you to

(3:23:28) explain how the chain of that causality goes. I can. Um Okay. What is it? Yeah. So, have you ever heard of a small

(3:23:35) island called Papa New Guinea? Yes. Are you aware of the [ __ ] warriors

(3:23:40) of Papa New Guinea? The what warriors? Yeah, the [ __ ] warriors of Papa New Guinea. So what they do is uh they take

(3:23:48) all the young boys of the tribe and they go load them up in their mouth with their semen. That's what they do.

(3:23:53) They're called the [ __ ] warriors of Papa New Guinea. And the kids, they just absolutely adore this because it's a

(3:23:59) right of passage to manhood. So the thing is is like it seems to keep their society completely together. So tell me,

(3:24:07) would you go in and break that society up even though it seems to be flourishing under those rules?

(3:24:14) Well, I think that it's morally wrong. Yeah, but would you go break the society up? Well, it legally doesn't matter. We're

(3:24:20) talking about morality here, not Yeah. I'm asking you morally, would you? If is there a moral that you should go

(3:24:27) in and break that society up? What do you mean? Like you're you're talking about legalistic stuff. No, it's

(3:24:33) No, I'm talking about morally. Would you give a moral argument? Do you want me to ask those [ __ ] This is This is This is ridiculous.

(3:24:38) Every time I try. You just asked me a question. How can you ask me a question? I was clarifying. I was clarifying. Um

(3:24:45) Yeah. Go ahead. Yeah. I don't think it's right to go in and like imprison and force on other

(3:24:51) cultures your culture. No. Okay. So, you wouldn't go in and stop the com warriors from loading up the

(3:24:56) 10-year-old boys with their semen in their mouth. I wouldn't I wouldn't lock them up, but that doesn't mean we can't explain to them like what the health

(3:25:03) ramifications of what it is that they're doing. Yeah. So, this is the problem with it's either

(3:25:09) do nothing or go in there and shoot all of them. That's the two options. Tried. They tried and they didn't care.

(3:25:16) Well, no. I don't think you can force on people moral obligations. Great. But you know what? Christians

(3:25:21) did. We sent in missionaries and we [ __ ] put a stop to it. Not you. And you abducted native children.

(3:25:29) We didn't abduct anybody. We didn't abduct anybody in Papa New Guinea. We didn't ab

(3:25:36) Guinea with with Canada where you went. What does that have to do with Papa New Guinea? You put them in Christian

(3:25:41) tortured them. What does it have to do with converted them? What does that have to do with Papa New?

(3:25:51) Okay. Florent N says, "Do you have a stance independent for any ought?" No,

(3:25:57) but it doesn't mean it's arbitrary. An actual answer, by the way,

(3:26:10) Mark, I think that they're accusing you of having used this reasoning. Yeah. Yeah. Arbitrary means there's

(3:26:15) nothing that's based upon. It means completely random. Like, I'm not sure if they understand what arbitrary means, but it means completely random. If

(3:26:21) you're determining it on a set of facts or a set of things, it's not arbitrary.

(3:26:26) Like you you need to understand what arbitrary means. It means just on a whim and that's not what we're doing.

(3:26:32) Inspire for truth. Yes, it is. If it is the case that your moral oughts come from no stance

(3:26:38) independent of you, then it is arbitrary. What are you basing on on except yourself? Unless you're just

(3:26:44) saying it's not arbitrary if I base all morals on me. And if that's the case, then all my moral odds are not arbitrary

(3:26:51) as long as they're based on me. Right, Mark? So it's based on random whim. Is that what you're saying?

(3:26:56) If it's based on you and whatever it is that you think and you think that whatever you think is an arbitrary means

(3:27:03) arbitary without system based upon a random whim or it just means without random choice.

(3:27:09) It means without system. So if it is the case then that you're saying that no my

(3:27:15) stance it's not without if you're saying my stances are not arbitrary my stances are also not okay

(3:27:21) well then are your stances arbitrary it's not with it's not just without any system it's without any reason without

(3:27:27) any reason that would be without a system reason is reason there is a system I choose human

(3:27:33) there is a reason why I choose human wellbeing that would be a system I have a I like that would be a system that

(3:27:40) would be a system. Right. Right. Then it's not arbitrary. So then the case is is that any of your stances are not arbitrary. Right.

(3:27:47) They're not arbitrary, but that doesn't mean they're none of mine are arbitrary either.

(3:27:54) None of yours. Well, I don't even know what your stances are based upon because you won't talk about power. I've already

(3:28:00) told you 100 times. My stance is I can't even talk about whether it's arbitrary or not because you keep lying about what

(3:28:07) your I'll tell you my stance again. I am the ultimate arbiter of all of morality.

(3:28:12) All right, I think we're on the next one. Rachel Wilson says, "Imagine a man who looks like AOG, the Defiler from Lord of

(3:28:20) the Rings, saying Andrew doesn't look good." Who's AOG? This one from PT Reed says,

(3:28:26) "Mark's offensive language hurts my Fifi, which is against my secular humanism. Straight to secular humanism

(3:28:33) jail. My preferences, Mark." Yeah. So that doesn't follow. They're

(3:28:38) just words. We don't sort of say, "Hey, if your feelings get hurt, that's it." Especially as um I am sort of throwing

(3:28:46) exactly Wilson's behavior back at him. What are you saying that it's moral for him and not for me? Have you got this

(3:28:53) sort of class system of morality? Is that what you're saying? Maybe it's a might makes right, which I think is

(3:28:58) probably a lot of Christians do believe in. Um but um the idea that that words

(3:29:03) because your feelings have been hurt. Well, I might say, you know, I'm not interested in you. Um, you know, if you

(3:29:09) are keen on me, I'm not interested because you seem horrible. Um, that even if that hurts your feelings, it it

(3:29:15) doesn't mean anything. This one from

(3:29:21) Kevin Blackwell said, "Mark said that philosophy exists. Can Mark use the scientific method to prove that

(3:29:27) philosophy exists? Can it be proven without the scientific method?"

(3:29:32) Well, I think it exists in an abstraction. Um but you know philosophy is simply the study of everything. It's

(3:29:39) like basically analyzing and providing reasons for foundations for everything. So really philosophy is kind of um um

(3:29:48) you know I mean everything is related to philosophy because it's the like sort of we're looking at foundations but it

(3:29:54) doesn't mean that science is just philosophy. No it's a branch just like

(3:29:59) you wouldn't say that deontology is just a just all of philosophy. No, that's not what anybody is saying. Um, it's that,

(3:30:06) hey, this is a branch of philosophy. This one for Andrew. Conspire for truth

(3:30:11) says Andrew just lost credibility because he thinks popularity equates to truth and contradicts himself by

(3:30:17) appealing to consensus based on his popularity.

(3:30:28) Um, you mean you mean I I I said a joke? This one from Andrew.

(3:30:35) Go ahead. I said I said I said I said a literal joke. That was an obvious joke. Is that

(3:30:40) if that's the best you can come up with with a gotcha in this debate after all the times I've [ __ ] wrecked your boy

(3:30:46) over here. Is that your idea of a joke? No one will care about you enough to do this, that,

(3:30:52) and the other. That's your idea of a joke. Yeah, it was pretty funny. A lot of people laughed. This one from Andrew

(3:30:58) Pazinski says, "Question for Andrew. Would you say Christianity gave rise to secularism in the west under the earlier

(3:31:04) Catholic Church rule? If not, what did?" Actually, I I tend to agree. This is a

(3:31:10) this is a pretty good position. Due to remittances and various or not remittances, I'm sorry. Uh due to

(3:31:18) Catholic Church policy, what was going on at the time, indulgences, things like this. Uh I do think that that did give

(3:31:25) rise to Protestantism which then in turn they turned to enlightenment principles

(3:31:30) because they didn't have a normative authority. Same problem that my opponent has. He has no normative authority except him. And so Protestants and by

(3:31:38) the way Protestantism had a lot to do with land grabs and a bunch of other [ __ ] too. It wasn't just the idea of

(3:31:45) separating away from the church due to indulgences. There's a pretty deep rich history there. Um, not a thing that Mark

(3:31:52) would ever really go into because he just, you know, all Christianity is bad because they molest children or some [ __ ] like that. Ignoring what

(3:31:59) secularists do. He doesn't care. He doesn't care the secularist institutions that have the same exact problems. It's

(3:32:05) just that, well, we can shut down the the sections responsible for those problems, but he can't do that in the

(3:32:11) church for some reason. Contradicted himself seven [ __ ] times at least on that. I brought it up multiple times. He

(3:32:17) kept on literally contradicting himself. this going to end or is going forever? I didn't I haven't interrupted you at

(3:32:22) all. I've been letting you literally give all of your answers. Did you just say you haven't interrupted

(3:32:28) me at all? As you've been giving your last few answers, I have not. No. Wow. Wow. Have I? As you've been giving your last

(3:32:34) few answers, have I? No. Well, this is going on a lot. Completely quiet at Bro, I haven't

(3:32:40) interjected a single time at the the last few answers you've given. I haven't even interjected myself. So, the thing

(3:32:46) is is like I'm just pointing this out that my my opponent as he claims Andrew

(3:32:52) doesn't want me to be heard. I think it's [ __ ] hilar like I would never try to get March channel banned or

(3:32:57) anything like that. I think that it's the best idea that you have morons like him out espousing their [ __ ] because

(3:33:03) it makes me look great. I I think it's great. Yeah. So, aside from the insults and

(3:33:09) stuff, just quickly, I never endorsed any of the stuff that he's basically mischaracterizing. I never said I would

(3:33:14) give any secular people a pass. So, he's just outright lying as per usual. And you should note that that he is just

(3:33:19) lying about my position on all of this stuff. And then he's like sort of, you know, poisoning the well by taring me with a bad brush. But that split between

(3:33:26) the Protestants and stuff, you know, and the the east schism was mostly about whether they'd listen to the pope or listen to the patriarchs. And basically

(3:33:33) the the Catholics didn't want to go through the patriarch and the patriarchs just thought the bishop of Rome was just another patriarch. So that was that

(3:33:39) split. The the whole thing about where you get your authority from. Yeah. That's an in it can't be mended. It's

(3:33:45) it's a mess. Christianity is a mess. This one sorry from do appreciate it. Also, thanks for

(3:33:51) those of you who have given to the GoFundMe uh fundraiser so far. That's for our new lenses for recordings of

(3:33:56) Destiny August 5th in Los Angeles in Andrew August 8th in Chicago.

(3:34:03) So, thank you very much Evan Cribs for your donation. Rinonaldo Pella and Joshua Baker. We appreciate that

(3:34:08) support. And this question coming in from Reaper CDL says, "Andrew, can you agree and argue the position that

(3:34:15) society would be better if child support and alimony would be outlawed for women

(3:34:20) who break their homes?"

(3:34:27) Yes. This one from Kevin Blackwell says,

(3:34:32) "Marcus that people can consent. That means consent exists. What part of the scientific method does he use to prove

(3:34:39) that consent exists? Well, consent is just a label that we

(3:34:44) give for people in agreement when you you agree to something. Like I don't know why you want to go to well, how do

(3:34:50) you prove that with the scientific method? We've had that for like centuries and centuries. Like I I don't

(3:34:56) know who would unless somebody is being incredibly disingenuous and incredibly

(3:35:01) um argumentative why they would say, "Hey, no, you know, agreement between people doesn't exist." Well, I I think

(3:35:07) you need serious help if that's the case. Um wow. I Yeah, but Mark, uh you would have to

(3:35:13) agree that agreement between people is not always so obvious. Consent is not

(3:35:19) always so obvious. And sometimes things which are in people's best interest are things they don't consent to. Are you

(3:35:25) trying to say that you don't need consent? In some cases, you don't. No. Really? Really? So, if if say for

(3:35:32) instance um a woman doesn't want to sleep with you, do you need consent? I think in that case you do. But in the

(3:35:37) case that I want to put a person in prison, do I need consent? No. Okay, then shut up, Mark.

(3:35:43) But I never used it in that context. Mark, you literally I literally just said you don't always need consent. You

(3:35:48) said yes. reason why we Yeah, we don't need consent where you are harming other people.

(3:35:54) And I said that again. You actually do. Listen, you don't actually need consent even when it comes

(3:36:00) to harming other people. Where did you come up with that? You don't what? I never said that.

(3:36:07) Let's Let's just make sure that I get this right. Repeat the position. No. Like if you're out there and you

(3:36:13) attack somebody, I don't need your consent to stop you. Yeah. What? But that has nothing to do

(3:36:19) with what I just said. What are you talking about? That has nothing to do with what I just said. What I'm talking What are you talking about?

(3:36:25) Yeah. What I said is that you don't always need consent from people. And you said yes, you do. And then I said, "No, I'll give you an example of that."

(3:36:31) No, I meant in the context of what he was talking about, which is when when somebody has a a some sort of

(3:36:38) psychological problem, they cannot give consent because they're not in their right mind. That's not true either, Mark.

(3:36:45) There's many people with many psychological problems and you wouldn't say that they could or couldn't give consent, right? Yeah.

(3:36:50) So for instance, if I'm depressed, that's a psychological problem. Can I give consent, Mark?

(3:36:56) Yeah, that's okay, Mark. There you go. Yeah. So this is just splitting hairs and basically what I'm saying again at a

(3:37:04) certain point. Well, is it okay for you if you go to somebody intellectually disabled and convince them without, you

(3:37:11) know, and don't have, you know, to sleep with them? Is that okay?

(3:37:17) Uh, intellectually disabled. How? Well, they they uh don't understand the

(3:37:23) consequences of their decisions. Well, that Well, so they're like 40 IQ or something or they have head damage.

(3:37:29) No, but if it is the case that there's a person who has a below average IQ and

(3:37:34) they consent to somebody with a higher IQ to have sex with him, is a person with a higher IQ doing something wrong,

(3:37:40) Mark? Do they understand the consequences of their actions? Well, I mean to the limited degree that

(3:37:45) many people understand the consequences to their actions, I suppose. Sure. Then yeah. So but what I'm saying is at a certain point if people are that

(3:37:53) in a state where they don't understand the consequences of their actions then it is you know you need that is they

(3:37:58) can't give consent we give the ability to consent to it and if they violate somebody else and break you know break

(3:38:05) their rights then yeah they don't get to consent to any of the the things like

(3:38:12) they have to consent to go into jail. What are you talking about? I don't but I don't actually understand this when you say

(3:38:17) you don't understand much. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. When when it comes from you I don't when you say when

(3:38:22) you say Okay. Any last on this point this particular

(3:38:28) Yeah. Yeah. Very just very quickly. The reason I don't understand it is because I can come up and envision like 80,000

(3:38:34) scenarios probably where you would agree that people who can't consent may need

(3:38:40) to be forced to consent, right? Yeah. Yeah. Well, then I I don't even

(3:38:46) understand what you're arguing with me about, Mark. We must go to the next one. His grace

(3:38:51) remains says, "Andrew, when we when he asked, "What is a toddler and you said

(3:38:57) you I died? He was a contradiction machine. No consistency in his argument."

(3:39:03) Okay. Yeah. I I know you guys are going to gonna go off like for Wilson is, you know, brains are currently attacking my

(3:39:09) chat right now. But um you know, the the He didn't actually he didn't actually

(3:39:15) sort of qualify what he actually meant because he knows that people aren't out there killing toddlers. Like nobody's

(3:39:21) out there doing that or else they're going to be arrested and put in jail. But he's such a piece of [ __ ] and a liar that he's willing to say it anyway. You

(3:39:27) know, he'll just lie to you because it when he wins. That's all he cares about. He's not honest. He's not actually

(3:39:32) saying things that are true. He just all he wants to do is win. Yeah. So, so when you mate,

(3:39:38) if you if you take something, you shotgun multiple points, I disagree with one aspect of it, then you equivocate

(3:39:43) and act like I'm disagreeing with all of it. That's the problem with Mark. You've been doing that the whole debate. But I will say this, and this is important. If

(3:39:50) there are actually people who are attacking Mark who are from the Crucible in his chat and harassing him, you will

(3:39:56) be [ __ ] banned. You will be banned. We have a zero harassment policy. We have always had a zero harassment

(3:40:02) policy. Mark did show up to be an interlocator. Whether I hate Mark's guts

(3:40:07) or not, you stay the [ __ ] out of his chat if you're there for harassment. You will be banned. Period.

(3:40:13) The same is true for Andrew's chat, but I I assume there's nobody from my, you know, my chat going over. You don't have a chat, Mark. As I said,

(3:40:20) funny farm says, "The figures responsible for the

(3:40:25) scientific method were deeply religions, Mark, inspired to rectify our fallen

(3:40:32) nature and bring us closer to truth." Well, I think that there is like a history of a lot of different people

(3:40:38) contributing to the scientific method. A lot of people during the enlightenment were actually deis, which isn't Christian, but it isn't atheist either,

(3:40:45) of course. Like, it is a separate thing where you basically go, "Well, hey, there's a god. let's examine what he's done to create this kind of thing. But

(3:40:52) just because the foundations of something is in Christianity, which I might add by sort of killing anybody that disagreed with them, were the only

(3:40:58) people around at the time because they kind of tortured and killed people who disagreed with their beliefs. So, you know, there's that. But, um, people

(3:41:05) like, you know, KL PA who really he is kind of the father of the modern scientific method with or the methods

(3:41:11) kind of thing, the overarching method methodology that we use. So, um, yeah,

(3:41:16) Christians have contributed a lot to science. That doesn't mean they own it or they're responsible for it.

(3:41:21) AJ Anderson says, "Is it okay to be white? If not, is it okay to be black? We covered this. Everybody's agrees is

(3:41:26) okay to be either." King of all pixels says, "Munks and priests have contributed huge to science throughout

(3:41:31) history. The Vatican has one of the best observatories in the world." Mark.

(3:41:37) Sure. Yeah. And I I like what they do. It it doesn't it's not like I'm saying, "Hey, there's nothing Christianity has

(3:41:43) done." Like, they've done a lot of good, but they've done a lot of bad as well. And the whole idea that, hey, because

(3:41:48) they've done some good, that's forgiven them for 2,000 years of, you know, bloodshed and torture and all of the

(3:41:55) horrible stuff that they have done um to everybody. I mean, the Cathars was a

(3:42:00) case of a genocide of people carried out by the Catholic Church.

(3:42:06) This one doesn't matter. This one from Kevin Blackwell says, "Mark, if science can only tell us facts but not ought,

(3:42:12) that means ought exist. What scientific methodology was used to determine that

(3:42:18) oughts exist?" What do you mean by ought exist? If you're talking about abstractions, then

(3:42:23) yeah, like they exist as an abstraction. But, you know, when if you're saying, "Hey, they should be out there in the

(3:42:29) material world somewhere," then I don't know what you're talking about because nobody's saying that. It is a stance,

(3:42:35) not a a Oh, sorry. Go ahead. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cut you off. Well, it's a stance, not a an actual

(3:42:41) thing that that exists like my pen or my coffee cup. On the on the previous super chat, you

(3:42:47) laid at the feet of Christianity anything which was done in the last 2,000 years. Would you be willing to

(3:42:52) take the same line with the Tokugawa Shogunate who killed all of the Buddhists, all of them, put them all to

(3:43:00) the sword in order to secure his reign? Would you put that at the feet of secularist?

(3:43:07) a shogunist who believed that emperawa shogunate who who who believed that emperor was a

(3:43:13) god. He was a shogun. He didn't believe the emperor was god. He didn't give a [ __ ] about the emperor. The the the shogun was the military

(3:43:20) leader for during that time. And he bowed to the emperor who was seen as the

(3:43:25) embodiment of the emperor was only seen literally the emperor was only seen this way by the

(3:43:32) masses never ever by the people who were actually in charge of the country including the damos and including the

(3:43:39) shogunate himself who often often orchestrated the assassination of the

(3:43:44) light of heaven. So the thing is, let me just ask you, when Tokagawa

(3:43:50) took out all of the Buddhists in his name, I mean, he killed them. He put them all to the sword. Every single

(3:43:56) Buddhist temple, he killed them all in order to secure his reign. Is that at the feet of secularists?

(3:44:05) What? What do you mean secularists? Yeah, I mean secularist. Sure. I mean, a much better example is is Russia with

(3:44:10) with Stalin. Yeah, I get I I get that. I'm just asking if it's the case though. See, I'm

(3:44:16) willing to in good faith make these derif der uh what's the right way to say

(3:44:21) this? I'm willing to differentiate between these various ideas that

(3:44:27) secularists could have different ideas amongst secularists because they do. But

(3:44:33) I just need you if you could just in ever in good faith say Christians also could have various ideas when it comes

(3:44:40) to Christianity and we should only associate the horrors of what Xgroup did

(3:44:46) with that specific group rather than uh associate it with the totality of uh

(3:44:53) things that you have in common with another group. I think that that's a way better way that we can reduce these

(3:44:58) things to see uh what group has done worse things. You make this great point.

(3:45:04) You say, Andrew, wait, that wasn't secular humanism in Russia. I would even be willing to concede that point if it

(3:45:10) were the case that you would say, well, when Catholics did bad thing, that doesn't fall at the feet of the Orthodox,

(3:45:17) you know, like why can't we ever make headway that way? So, you would have a point.

(3:45:23) You got you would have a point if the debate was Christianity versus the Shogunate or,

(3:45:28) you know, Shintoism or whatever they had there at the time or secularism. you would have a point. But that is not the case. It's it's Christianity versus

(3:45:34) secular humanism. And it's funny that every time the it's Christianity versus secular

(3:45:42) humanism and the effects on society. Okay. Well, split hairs, but sure. No, no, that's really an important

(3:45:48) detail. Secularism. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Um, you know, we we we Sorry, you just

(3:45:56) interrupted and I get what you're saying that the effects on society. Sure. Sure. Um, but what I'm pointing out is that

(3:46:03) hey, Christians did that thing against the Cathars. They were Christians under

(3:46:08) any definition while they're not Christians anymore. Well, this but this is my problem,

(3:46:14) right? It's like we're talking about the effects on Hang on. Well, I'm trying to answer the question. If you're trying to ask about the effects Christianity has

(3:46:21) on society or the effects secularism or secular ethics or secular humanism has

(3:46:26) on society, then for me to be good faith with you, you want me to isolate only

(3:46:32) what secular humanists do and believe. And I think that that's totally fair. I just wish that ever it would be good

(3:46:38) faith the other way where you would isolate that there could be Christian groups who do do they identify as Christian but

(3:46:46) don't follow the general ethics of the denomination in which I'm advocating for or which other people would advocate

(3:46:53) for. That's my problem here. Well, it's kind of funny because every time you want to sort of say, "Hey,

(3:46:59) we're responsible for science and all of these things and all of the things that came from the Enlightenment thing."

(3:47:05) Well, it's what the the earlier question said, but every time that you want to like sort of tally the Christians,

(3:47:11) they're all Christians. But now that you sort of point out that, hey, these per people were um sort of Christians by any

(3:47:19) means that we can evaluate and um you know, their past they did these horrible things, then suddenly you don't want to

(3:47:25) count them as Christians anymore. Whereas nobody thinks that the Shinto shogun under under, you know, uh uh the

(3:47:32) the the Japanese Shintoism was a secular humanist. Like if you wanted that

(3:47:38) debate, um you would probably have to go with a denomination like secular humanism versus Greek Orthodox or

(3:47:44) something or whatever you think is the representation. I'm not sure because this is this is but this is my whole problem, right? It's

(3:47:50) like within the this idea of the categorization, you seem to kind of make this smuggle where you say, "Wait a

(3:47:57) second, it's not fair for you to put at the feet of secular humanists

(3:48:02) each atrocity which secularists have done." Those weren't secular humanists. And yet, at the same time, you're

(3:48:08) willing to state, "Well, but I believe Christians are anybody who identifies as a Christian." If that's the case then

(3:48:14) Mark then I can take each atrocity and say fine all Christians did this

(3:48:20) atrocity they're universally responsible but then you can't say that all the universal good is not collectively

(3:48:26) shared as well that's the problem more I never said that

(3:48:32) contributed a lot I made that acknowledgement occasions I just want this question think that having an observatory in Rome

(3:48:40) like what they actually call it Lucifer not the observatory That's not what I'm talking about. Just it's an I'm just using as an example

(3:48:47) like just because they've done this awesome thing doesn't wipe out a river of blood.

(3:48:53) I just want this last question answered. Then if that's the case, the totality of Christian, the totality, all of it

(3:49:00) together, every bit of everybody's ever identified as a Christian, do you honestly believe that in society,

(3:49:08) every single human being who's ever identified as being a Christian and all of their actions, has that led to more

(3:49:15) harm than good? Yes or no? I think it's led to more harm. Yeah,

(3:49:21) we must go to the next one. Gavin Freone uh got that one. His grace remains says

(3:49:27) sex workers in our society cause no problems Mark spreading diseases and modeling the worst behavior for young

(3:49:33) ladies. Even some atheists agree this is harmful to a society.

(3:49:39) Yeah, some atheists, but I don't think that's secular humanists. I think that like I said about Only Fans, there

(3:49:44) should be more regulation and protection of these people rather than just, you know, forcing them to the sex workers.

(3:49:51) Um Amsterdam more protection for the sex workers. Yes. Um Amsterdam has a thriving sort of

(3:49:58) industry on it where there is high it's highly regulated and they're kept so does Japan. Um

(3:50:04) for red light districts. I don't know. I don't scab says of course Mark is a fan of Only Fans.

(3:50:13) Next one. Oh no. I don't even use Only Fans. I just don't have a problem with it. That's all.

(3:50:18) Not even a little bit. Not even a little bit. No. No. I don't even know. Um,

(3:50:24) so 18 would you allow your 18-year-old daughter to go on Only Fans? Sure.

(3:50:30) Oh, wow. This one coming in from Red Fox says, "Mark, who are the good guys in

(3:50:35) Star Wars and why?" Uh, the Rebellion

(3:50:41) because authoritarianism and um pure evil, which does not allow people to

(3:50:47) express or be themselves. And when they're slaughtering people, like I don't know how you could view these as the uh the good guys is is incredible.

(3:50:53) The the the empire were definitely the good guys. And I'll debate you on that, Mark, anytime you want. Sure. Sure.

(3:50:59) This one from Guy says, "Question from Mark. How can you make any moral claims? Where do morals come from? Are these

(3:51:05) just your preferences?" No, I'm a metaethical um relativist. So

(3:51:11) basically, it's based upon something that I choose to work towards. Um, so I've explained this like 50 times during

(3:51:18) the debate. I I really don't want to explain it again because I think I'm like beating a dead horse or possibly a

(3:51:23) horse that isn't listening at this point. Gabby says, "Mark definitely kisses his own brother on the mow." This one from

(3:51:33) Lewis says, "Mark, for the record, he does not kiss his own brother." Uh, it

(3:51:38) says Mark condemns gas. His wife would be jealous. I'll tell you that right now. You're right about that.

(3:51:46) Mark condemns gaslighting, then goes on and tries to gaslight Andrew immediately

(3:51:53) after by saying, "Why are you so mad? Your life sucks." It's total projection.

(3:52:00) Mark hates himself and the devil loves that. That was actually really weird when you

(3:52:06) brought up that I had stepids for why my life sucked. Mark, that was very strange. Well, it's just sort of

(3:52:11) pointing out you live in a bubble of hypocrisy on what you What's the hypocrisy?

(3:52:18) Well, it's hypocrisy. It's telling people to do something that you should What am I telling people to do that I'm

(3:52:23) not doing? Okay. Well, I I apologize then. I You know, really, we're just seeing that.

(3:52:28) So, you just made it up, Mark. Yeah. No, I just insulted you. Yeah. Okay. So, just like you've been insulting me

(3:52:34) and making up things about me. Yeah. But here's the thing, Mark. There's two things that I would differentiate. No, no, you

(3:52:40) the first Mark, I would never go after your family, Mark. Ever. That's fair.

(3:52:45) Ever. That's fair. I I don't

(3:52:51) So So maybe maybe them Christian ethics ain't as bad as you think. From

(3:52:56) I don't think I need Christian ethics to to Well, then why did you Why did you

(3:53:01) saying I'm I'm not saying I'm perfectly moral either? Are you saying you're perfectly moral? I'm saying I wouldn't

(3:53:06) have ever gone after your family. Well, I didn't go after your family. Yeah, you did. No, I didn't.

(3:53:13) You literally brought them up as trying to make an example of me being a hypocrite because you thought I was a red pillar, which is your problem that

(3:53:20) you believed that [ __ ] A red pillar. Yeah. You believe that I was some person who was out here saying, "Oh, I'm

(3:53:26) married to a woman with kids, so therefore anybody who's ever married a woman with kids is bad." Or some [ __ ]

(3:53:31) like that. I've never said anything. If you don't want it to get personal, don't get personal. Personal with you is different than me

(3:53:38) going after what you think. I don't give a [ __ ] what I can do them. I didn't do anything.

(3:53:44) Okay, then I'll go after your wife. Go after his wife, chat. Sure. Go for it. You're right. So, why would my wife care

(3:53:52) what you think? And if you're going to give it, why can't you take I was joking, by the way. I'm joking. Would you

(3:53:58) do that? I'm just pointing out, Mark, the difference between me and you. I would never have gone after your family. That's all.

(3:54:03) Well, I didn't go after them. I just Stop lying. Stop lying. You I checked to see whether you wanted to talk about

(3:54:09) your life and you went, "Yep, yep. Bring it on." Don't ask for it if you can't take it, you child.

(3:54:14) Wait a second. You're saying that Don't ask for it if you can't take it. Stop crying, man. You made it personal

(3:54:22) and now you go, "Oh, but that's a step too far." is you called me all kinds of names and stuff. You [ __ ] winging

(3:54:28) child. Go away. I'm done with you. You're a freaking idiot. So to get this right. Seriously, I say

(3:54:33) I try to reach out an olive branch and you're done. That's an olive branch. No, I'm Yeah, I said well I apologize and

(3:54:39) you just go, you know, after you insist. Was it really an apology? Then was it really an apology?

(3:54:44) Yes, it was. How can it be an apology if you're doubling down on it, stupid? Well, I say I apologize and you throw it

(3:54:50) back in my I apologize unless you don't accept it. Well, and you are you going to apologize for

(3:54:56) what you've done today as well? No, you're not going to go after your family because you're a [ __ ] piece of [ __ ]

(3:55:02) You're a piece of [ __ ] You're a piece of [ __ ] You are the most terrible human on the face of the planet. Like

(3:55:08) seriously, go yourself in a room. Save everybody from your disgusting views and

(3:55:15) go and save society from the horribleness that is you, Andrew Wilson,

(3:55:20) because you are the worst person, one of the most heinous people on the face of

(3:55:26) the planet. And not just atheists believe that, Christians believe that as well. You are a disgrace to the entire

(3:55:33) world, to humanity. I'm a horrible guy, Mark, but I never would have gone after your But I never would have gone after your family.

(3:55:39) Oh, yeah. Everything else is fine. Just just lying about me like doing pedophile is fine. Is that is that it? Is that

(3:55:45) what you lie about? Did I lie about you being a pedophile? Yes, you did. Yes, you did. You said

(3:55:51) that I support PDF file. You said that. No, I said I said Mark, you wouldn't want to be getting it to PDF. Apologize.

(3:55:57) You said that today. You said that today. Yes, you did. That's just You're such a liar, man.

(3:56:02) But even if it was the case that I called you that, I still wouldn't have gone after your family, Mark. Hey, I asked you if you wanted to go

(3:56:08) there. You wanted to go there. What? No, Mark. Mark, the thing is don't accept it. Hey, I always

(3:56:13) permission. You gave permission. That's called consent. And consented, so you're

(3:56:19) right, Mark. It's just that if you had said sure, I still wouldn't have. You must go. It makes me a better person than you,

(3:56:25) Mark. You will never be a better person than just about anybody. Scabby says it

(3:56:31) says, "Lord Jake is your daddy, Mark." And Jacob German says, "Mark talks about

(3:56:37) philosophy. You can't even get logical fallacies right. Constant genetic fallacies, equivocation, red herrings,

(3:56:42) and appeals to authority. No, it's not genetic fallacy. If someone says, "Hey, take for granted I'm

(3:56:48) delusional." That's not saying, "Hey, you're delusional." Like, they've granted it. Like, I don't know what genetic fallacy that you're talking.

(3:56:54) That's going to origins of things. That's basically going to origins. So, which I I don't know how you would say I

(3:57:01) did. Rip to say, "Question from Mark. If delusions are dangerous, then why call trans women women?" Sounds like you are

(3:57:07) perfectly willing to distort reality if the outcomes are favorable. Interesting how that works, huh?

(3:57:13) They're not delusional about anything. That's the thing. That's the secret. They're not delusional. And we know this

(3:57:18) through psychological studies. They're not delusional. You don't know things through psychological studies. Delusion is a distorted perception of

(3:57:26) reality. You don't know things through psychological studies. Here's here's the really horrible thing.

(3:57:32) I'm still being interrupted by the most heinous man on the on the planet. But we

(3:57:38) we know that like delusion is a distortion of reality. And so what what

(3:57:43) reality are they delusional about? Yeah, we got to mute him because God,

(3:57:48) he's got no self-control whatsoever. This one coming in from Riptor says,

(3:57:55) "Question from Mark." Let me go to the

(3:58:00) if delusions are dangerous. Oh, we call we got that one. Sorry, we did that one. AJ Anderson says, "Mark, is it okay for

(3:58:07) women to abort brown and black babies or is it wrong to do that?"

(3:58:14) Um, I I don't think it makes any kind of difference. If it's before the cut off point, then they can choose to do it or

(3:58:21) not to do it. Like, I don't ask the reason why.

(3:58:27) So, so if it were the case, Mark, that women collectively decided that they wanted to remove the children from their

(3:58:34) womb because they would turn out to be black and that's the only reason they terminated the fees. I don't ask. I don't ask. It's none of

(3:58:41) my business. Yeah, but if that was the case that they all told my business, but if they all told you that business, are they wrong,

(3:58:46) Mark? It's none of my business. I'm not their reasons. Mark, when I ask the question

(3:58:52) about the question, I don't get to tell women what to do with their

(3:58:58) I know you think you do, but I I don't. That's my belief. Mark, if Yeah, this isn't this isn't Andrew

(3:59:03) question time. It isn't. Why don't you understand how the debate works? I don't

(3:59:08) understand anything about this. If a woman asked you or if a woman No, this is not Andrew question time. Why are we even allowed? If a woman told

(3:59:16) now listen, James, you got to let me ask this question. No, you don't have to let him ask. You have to let me at least ask the

(3:59:21) question. I can interrupt and No, it's not Andrew. You know what? I'll mute the rest of the time if you just let me ask this

(3:59:28) question. What a liar. You will not mute. We've all seen it. Let me Not only will I, I give my word.

(3:59:34) Okay, wait. Hold on. Just let me just ask this one question. Hold on one sec. Just relax. Okay. So, I

(3:59:40) think Mark, to summarize, just said he's like, "No, if a woman uh wants to abort

(3:59:46) her baby because it's black, that's okay with him." And Mark, you're giving the thumbs up,

(3:59:53) Mark. I'm surp Don't give you I'm not I'm not trying to be hard on you. I'm just like, this is you're really biting

(3:59:58) the bullet. Don't you know I just It's It's none of my business. I don't

(4:00:04) do this. I You know, we're talking about stopping them. And hey, I might think it might be immoral, but I don't have the

(4:00:11) right to tell people why they should make the decisions that they should do. That's it.

(4:00:17) So, if women collectively said that they wanted to abort all of their fetuses just because they were black, you would

(4:00:23) support that. Yes or no? I I it would be not the Would I support it? No. I don't I don't like want people

(4:00:30) to have abortions, but I uphold their right to. I wouldn't stop them. Correct. Yeah. So, so it's morally permissible

(4:00:37) that all of those women to to hang on. It's morally permissible, right?

(4:00:42) It's permissible for a woman to do that under any for any reason.

(4:00:47) So, and and can we just just wonder at the the example being given if every

(4:00:54) woman in the world collective like seriously this is nonsense stuff. This is This is Andrew being Well, Andrew

(4:01:02) really. You got it. This one from Scabby. Uh got

(4:01:08) that one. Jojo says, "I like you, Andrew, but you lost the debate." AJ Anderson says, "I don't love you, Mark,

(4:01:14) and you lost the debate." Scabby says, "I think those bright lights."

(4:01:20) Okay. Well, you have to understand that there's often times, and I'm sure even Mark would agree with this, that the

(4:01:25) opposition to the other person will come in and pretend that they're a supporter of the person so that they can make the

(4:01:31) comment, "Oh, I'm a big fan of you, but you lost the debate. I've seen this tactic 100 times." But you know what the

(4:01:38) difference between me and most people is? I actually will follow those accounts. I'll put mods on it to follow

(4:01:44) the account and then I track them back. And it turns out almost every time they're a fan of the other guy, leaving

(4:01:50) a message there that they're a fan of me so that they can say, "Oh, I'm a big fan

(4:01:55) of you, but you lost." Isn't that funny how that works, Mark? I bet you that chatter I bet you we're going to find

(4:02:02) out he's one of your fans, Mark. Well, I don't I certainly wouldn't encourage people to do so. I've had tons

(4:02:08) of people come into my chat and sort of say, "Hey, um, you know, I'm an atheist, but I thought this." And and I don't, as

(4:02:14) I said before, I don't support this kind of gaslighting. Like just be honest about what you think. Seriously.

(4:02:20) This one from Patriot Musk says, "Mark, do secularist secular humanists or

(4:02:25) Christians give more humanitarian aid?" Um, it's interesting because there's a couple of studies that we can we can

(4:02:31) see. And it's kind of the numbers are skewed because um, Christians give to their churches which may or may not be

(4:02:37) humanitarian aid. I don't know how anyone could argue that, you know, the the prosperity gospel churches are

(4:02:42) humanitarian aid unless you consider humanity to be the guy making millions off of it. Um, but it's it I have a

(4:02:50) study that basically says that atheists are actually more generous outside of their inroup. So, they'll give more to

(4:02:55) people that aren't atheists, whereas Christians give more to Christians and

(4:03:01) Christians alone. I would like for you guys to note though that he said, "Well, what if you're giving to a prosperity

(4:03:06) gospel preach," which by the way are the minority. Most church giving doesn't go to prosperity gospel preachers, that's

(4:03:12) insanity. And secondly, the Well, actually, we can we can look this up, right? We know it

(4:03:18) goes to Mormons and the Catholic Church, and we can actually look at the funding, can't we? You literally just said this

(4:03:24) earlier. And so, because of this, I didn't look at the funding. Hang on. Can you Can you let me finish? I didn't interrupt you while you gave

(4:03:29) your answer. Yep. So the thing is that's so funny about this is like you can just look at this and say okay if it is the

(4:03:36) case most churches have a fund which is designed to be given out to charity.

(4:03:42) Literally they have a fund almost all of them do and it doesn't matter the denomination almost all of them do. If

(4:03:47) it is the case that you're giving to the church like he says it's still the case that most of it is going out in

(4:03:53) charitable contributions after the cost of the church and this type of thing. Does he have a point on prosperity

(4:03:59) gospel? Sure. Most Christians are against prosperity gospel. By the way, most church funding is going out to

(4:04:05) charity. That is the case. If Mark could factually show me that is not the case, which you'll never be able to do, I'd

(4:04:11) love to hear it. And most secular progressive charity giving actually doesn't even get to the charity. That's

(4:04:17) what's so funny. Uh yeah, I think you'd have it goes to administrative costs, Mark.

(4:04:22) Yeah, it does. It goes to administrative cost. I think that that sort of the the administrative costs occur in the churches as well.

(4:04:28) Not to the same degree. they do is they basically give to Christians only and ignore everybody else. And that's that's

(4:04:34) the problem. Are more generous. Um it's also the case that Christians have a lot more infrastructure. They have a lot

(4:04:40) more people. They have a lot more than atheists. Entirely unsurprising.

(4:04:45) Well, that's just an adop. That's just like, hey, we've got the most people. That's not adopulum. That's just

(4:04:50) pointing out that these this group of people gives way more to charity than

(4:04:56) this group of people per capita. That's not adopulum. That's per capita.

(4:05:02) Yeah. Yeah, that's probably slightly true. Um but it is also probably true. Yeah. Yeah, that that is true. Well, I'm

(4:05:08) not sure about that in countries. I know that's like that in the US. Um but also

(4:05:13) a lot of atheists and secular humanists believe that the government should be doing a lot of these things that the churches are doing. So they will

(4:05:19) actually support higher taxes and things like that, which will mostly come higher taxes to

(4:05:24) take care of. I didn't interrupt you. Come on. Ask me a question. You just asked me a

(4:05:29) question. The answer is no. Well, I didn't ever get to finish it. I didn't ever get to finish it. The answer is no.

(4:05:35) So, you don't support higher taxes taking. Okay. Okay. We're good.

(4:05:40) So, yeah, you give to charity instead of having higher taxes. Atheists support higher taxes. There you go. So, atheist support taking That's not

(4:05:48) charity. That's forced, dummy. What do you mean it's forced? Uh, if I

(4:05:53) don't want to give it and you force me to, then that's forc.

(4:05:59) That's not charity. That's the opposite of charity. Oh, atheist support higher tax rates. Well, what if I don't want to

(4:06:05) give it? Then we'll force you to. That's force, not charity. It's the opposite of [ __ ] charity.

(4:06:13) Yeah. So what? It's It's the same outcome. That's not charity. Doofus.

(4:06:19) God. Mark, how do you think like this, Mark? This one from

(4:06:26) Otis Driftwood says, "How does it Okay, that's weird. Patriot Musk." We got that

(4:06:32) one, guys. Did I read this question for Mark? How can you make any moral claim? Where do morals come from? Are are these

(4:06:38) just your preferences? Did I read that? It's on the last one. Just because Andrew is speaking over the top of me.

(4:06:44) I'd like to have the last word for once because the man cannot shut his face. I gave you the last word of the last

(4:06:49) three. The last three. I got the last three. What are you talking about? Can we mute him, please? Um, only because you were

(4:06:55) muted, Andrew. Let's face it. No, I muted myself, doofus.

(4:07:01) Ask James. Ask James if I'm lying. Ask James if I'm lying. Cuz seriously, I

(4:07:06) Okay, I need you to answer the question mark, please. Oh, okay. What was What was the question?

(4:07:12) He says, "How can you make any moral claim? Where do morals come from? Are these just your preferences?"

(4:07:17) Yeah, it it's an intersubjective agreed upon standards between people of what we want out of society. And if you don't

(4:07:24) want a healthy society, then go off and make your own collapsing society. That's fine.

(4:07:29) Okay. And just with the last one, I I actually opted for more taxes. It's still a choice. It is still a choice to do. And

(4:07:36) so this thing of, oh, it's not charity. Well, no, not technically, but if we're in favor of paying more to help people,

(4:07:41) what's the freaking difference? No, don't let him answer. Keep on going. He doesn't get the last word. No, [ __ ]

(4:07:47) him. I'm not even going to take the last word. Just ask a question. What's coercion?

(4:07:54) Yeah, I'm I'm not letting him get the last word. Okay. I You would get the last word. Answer the question.

(4:08:00) We're looking at who will be willing to help people and help humanity.

(4:08:06) We're willing to No, shut up, Andrew. I'm not I'm not playing your stupid little game. The fact that we're willing

(4:08:11) to give more, it shows that hey, atheists aren't this able to gun point. You'll give more at gunpoint.

(4:08:19) This one from [ __ ] dumbass. What a stellar Christian.

(4:08:25) I know that. Yeah, you're I mean, Mark, you're stupid. I don't know what to do about that, bro. I know that. I know that sometimes. So,

(4:08:32) remember this. You are so [ __ ] dumb, dude. Seriously, you have you have We're going to give it more charity like

(4:08:39) this. Give me more hedgehog. Dude, you have the the intellect of a brick and

(4:08:45) not a particularly bright brick. You got me, Mark. You got me, Mark. Yeah. Yeah. No, keep drinking your alcohol. Keep getting

(4:08:50) Hey, give me all your money for charity. Give me all your money for charity. I bet it feels makes you feel better.

(4:08:56) Give me all your money for charity. Give me all your money for charity. Drunk. Are you okay? You are drunk,

(4:09:02) obnoxious, upset, yelling, screaming. We must go to the next one. PG. Mark, if

(4:09:08) secular humanism doesn't outlaw religions, couldn't religions flourish and outlive secularists, making

(4:09:14) secularism lesser? By the way, Mark, wouldn't wouldn't you drink? Excuse me. Excuse me. This was to me.

(4:09:21) I don't drink. Oh, you should start. Well, let's go to the question. Really? Why?

(4:09:27) Just No. Well, I mean, because maybe you'd be less insufferable. I don't know. Oh, no. Start telling me how to live my

(4:09:33) life. Go for I I will happily forgive me. I'm sorry you guys, but um

(4:09:40) the question was Mark. If secular humanism doesn't outlaw religions, couldn't religions flourish and outlive

(4:09:47) secularists? Uh no. If if sort of you know secular humanism, the only way to be an atheist

(4:09:53) was to be born. Sure. But that's not the only way. A lot of people deconstruct realize um that hey I can't believe what

(4:10:00) it is that I've been told about these magical floods and these this stuff and they turn to it. So in fact no religion

(4:10:08) is actually growing. It's one of the fastest growing demographics that we have and it's not because oh you guys

(4:10:13) don't have children. No that's not the only way you make a secular humanist. Basically, in order to make a secular

(4:10:19) humanist or even a theistic humanist, all you realize is, hey, it would be best for all of us if we help and, you

(4:10:25) know, support one another and do the best for humans. That's it. Harbar Nar says, "Mark, I'm trying to

(4:10:33) watch Dustin Pierers's last fight night. I think Andrew gave you a TKO in this

(4:10:39) debate. You were great though." Um, yeah. So Andrew's got these tactics

(4:10:44) that he uses which are really dishonest and they're not seen as honest anywhere in debate. Interruptions, calling names,

(4:10:50) behaving like a child. Um, you know, when when you go into a discussion, I do realize he said before, hey, I like

(4:10:56) blood sports. It's like, yeah, but do you realize that you put people off by

(4:11:02) doing this? Like, how are you supposed to think that that Andrew Wilson wants the best for you when he's just been a I

(4:11:08) won't say that. That's a very Australian word, but hey, I won't I won't demonetizing your channel.

(4:11:13) Vincent says, "If morality is malleable, then there's no point using it. The same

(4:11:18) with gender. Men are women, and good can be evil. No objective truth."

(4:11:24) Uh, no. No. Good and evil is relative to the goal that you're trying to get to. So, I say, "Hey, if you're headed towards human well-being, it's good. If

(4:11:30) you're headed away, it's it's evil. It's bad." Or at least if it's intentional, it's bad. It's evil. Um, and that that's

(4:11:36) all. Like, that's the thing. Like I'm not getting into uh this isn't a debate about trans issues. I know that you want

(4:11:42) to get that as a gotcha, but it it really isn't. It's just that you have gender and sex. The den gender is

(4:11:49) different than sex. Sex is different than gender. And you know, I don't know how many times people have to explain

(4:11:55) this to you to to understand it. This one for Andrew from Dale Peterson says,

(4:12:02) "Hey Andrew, if you concede for the purpose of debate, God is a delusion. Are you saying you prefer a useful lie

(4:12:09) over uncertainness in truth?" Good job, Andrew and Mark.

(4:12:16) Um, well, it was it was addressed to me, Mark. But I would not ever in a million

(4:12:22) years because I gave my word that I would not interrupt anymore. Mark, go

(4:12:27) ahead. You can field all the questions from here on out unless you ask me specifically to field this one and then I will.

(4:12:33) But you have to say please, Mark. Please. If it was for you, I I would like you to answer it. Say please.

(4:12:39) I did. I said please. Go ahead. Oh, okay. Well, thank you for saying please, Mark. Uh, so this is a this is a

(4:12:45) really interesting conundrum, right? So within the confines of the internal critique, if it is the case that I

(4:12:51) concede the point that I'm delusional, then Mark actually has to acquies that he also is, uh, both of us would be

(4:12:57) coming from the same foundation. We both literally would just want to see at that point our worldview imposed on the world

(4:13:04) based on our non-stance independent reasons. So So is that delusional? If it

(4:13:10) is, then Mark's [ __ ] delusional. I don't think Mark's delusional. He thinks I'm delusional based on what, though? If

(4:13:17) it's my stance that I believe in a god and this is where I get my moral au that's my stance. What's any more

(4:13:23) delusional about that than Mark saying I get my stance from me. I'm the ultimate arbiter. Right? This is the problem. You

(4:13:30) can grant the entire secularist humanist worldview and they still can't give you better odds for society than

(4:13:36) Christianity. And that's what's so hilarious about doing that. And you can always do it and you will always win.

(4:13:43) And there's nothing they can do about it. There's nothing they can do about it. Because if you don't build your

(4:13:49) house on something that's made out of out of something set like stone, something that's set with a good

(4:13:56) foundation, if it's built on sand, it caves in. You never have to argue it. Who cares about God not real? God not

(4:14:03) real though. Who gives a [ __ ] If if that's the case, then it just comes down to preferences and my own stances. And

(4:14:09) if my stance is to [ __ ] rule, you got nothing. You just got to take it and that's it. Especially if I can rule by

(4:14:15) consensus. You just got to take it. That's that's Mark's entire stance. Okay. I never said you were delusional.

(4:14:22) You granted you were delusional. That was a self-own. Basically, that was you owning yourself. So, um if you said it

(4:14:29) has to be set on stone, has to be set on limestone. Notice he didn't talk about his foundation. He didn't want to address it at all. He ran away from it.

(4:14:35) So, we don't know his foundation. It could be could be utter delusion. I don't think he's delusional. I think he's mistaken. But if he wants to say,

(4:14:41) "Hey, I'm delusional." Well, yeah, you're delusional, but I'm not the one claiming to have a god as some kind of

(4:14:46) moral standard. So, you did say I was delusional, Mark. I I said that you Yeah, you're delusional cuz you granted it. Do you

(4:14:53) understand that when you grant something, you're granting it for the other side? Yeah, but I only granted it because you said I was delusional.

(4:14:59) No, no, no. You can't grant it and then go, "Oh, wait, no. I I'm not going to grant it." You know, if you No, I granted it after you said I was

(4:15:05) delusional. I said you would be delusional. And Mark, I'm going to show you the clips.

(4:15:11) Mark, we've been clipping the whole thing. I promise we'll show you the clips. Wow. Can't wait to do this, but we just

(4:15:16) have to be very concentrated. Mark Marty Kamiho says, "For someone who hates them, Andrew is obsessed with trans

(4:15:21) people." Hate? I'm sorry. I live in a society

(4:15:28) full of people who are trying to create legislation to mutilate children. You think that I should be obsessed with

(4:15:33) something besides that? What should I be obsessed with besides that? What is the thing that you think, Chatter, that I

(4:15:40) should worry about inside of the societal structure in which I live? When you say that it's okay to mutilate

(4:15:46) [ __ ] children, when you say it's okay to give them puberty blockers, when you say it's okay to put them in different leagues other than their own, when you

(4:15:53) say that that's okay, why shouldn't I worry about that? Why should I instead just kick my feet up and say, "Well, K

(4:16:00) Sra, whatever we'll [ __ ] be will be." [ __ ] that and [ __ ] you,

(4:16:05) AJ. No. mutilating children. This is a complete mischaracterization. And we're just basically trying to keep them

(4:16:11) alive, happy, and healthy, which they are after that kind of thing. That guy took this kid.

(4:16:17) I didn't interrupt you. I didn't interrupt you. Andrew Wilson is just a hateful bigot who doesn't like trans

(4:16:23) people. He's against his It's against his Bible. God Bible. God Bible. Doesn't like them. So, he wants to get rid of

(4:16:29) all of them however he can and doesn't care if they're they're ending their own lives at a horrible rate. He doesn't

(4:16:34) care about the children. He came. Sounds like a self-correcting problem, huh? Mark, one shot in. Wow. Real compassion.

(4:16:40) You heard what I said. You heard what I said. You heard what I said.

(4:16:45) You really care about the children, don't you? Yeah. What a I do. If there's

(4:16:50) no more care if they die. Yeah. No, I care about Oh, the trans children are dying because

(4:16:57) they're influenced by crazies like you to become trans in the first place. That is not why they

(4:17:03) Yeah, it is. You [ __ ] sack of [ __ ] Yes, it is. Have you read any studies on it? Have you seen any neurology?

(4:17:10) Send it to me. Sorry to do this, but OneShot A17 says went after his children and is throwing

(4:17:17) a tantrum that he got called on it. This one from Rachel Wilson. Mark thinks

(4:17:22) Andrew raising three children he has no obligation to is an example of being a hypocrite with bad morals. Please explain. So, do I understand right? It

(4:17:30) was just because you thought you thought Andrew is a red pillar who is like against marrying a woman with children.

(4:17:35) Yes, that um so and and here's the thing like um I've put up with a lot through this

(4:17:41) debate and so I don't think I didn't I didn't do anything specific. I didn't really I just asked him how many

(4:17:46) children he has and whether they were all from the same parent. What does that have to do with anything though?

(4:17:51) Can I talk or are you just going to What would that have actually had to do? No, Andrew. Shut the [ __ ] up. I'm talking. Seriously, you have been an

(4:17:57) absolute pig this debate and so shut the [ __ ] up. What would that have had to do with anything though?

(4:18:02) So the whole idea that you know we have a healthy and happy life. There's certain things that don't can you know

(4:18:09) help that. And so the whole idea that he didn't have a happy life he kind of says oh if you're divorced you can't have a happy life. You do these things you

(4:18:16) can't have a happy life. You have multiple baby you know with different fathers you can't have a happy life. But now he wants to change it to oh no he's

(4:18:22) perfectly happy. Congratulations. That's the only point I was making. I wasn't pointing out who his family was. I

(4:18:28) wasn't pointing out their situation. And I asked him about his family. I didn't bring them up. And I also asked

(4:18:34) permission to talk about his life, which he gave. Why give permission? Mark, when have I said any of those

(4:18:41) things? What? Ever? That if you if you um if you get

(4:18:46) divorced, you can't be happy if you have Oh, you you smoke around your kids. I don't know why I would take parents.

(4:18:52) Yeah. When when have I ever said any of the things you just claimed, Mark? Ever.

(4:18:57) Well, I asked whether you had babies from different mothers. Yeah. Why? What would that be relevant to?

(4:19:03) Well, whether you have a happy life and you like Well, how is that relevant to me being happy?

(4:19:09) Well, you don't seem happy. You look really upset. Yeah. How is that relevant to me being happy? Are you upset? Are you Are you in a bad

(4:19:15) place? Do you need to talk about it? Yeah. How is that relevant to me being happy? Are you okay? Are you okay? Mark, can you answer my question?

(4:19:21) All right. I don't like what the [ __ ] are you talking about? I don't. That's your answer. I don't

(4:19:26) Oh, yeah. You seem like such a happy guy. Bunch of bunch of drills. You've been the one screaming.

(4:19:32) You were screaming earlier and you're the one interrupting seconds because you can't actually let anybody speak because

(4:19:37) you are so insecure. Mark, when you answer the questions I ask you. When you are secure, you can let the

(4:19:44) other side talk. And then this guy interrupts every two seconds because he's so [ __ ] afraid of anybody saying,

(4:19:49) "Are you secure, Mark?" Yeah. Then why even talk? And why even talk?

(4:19:55) Yeah, cuz I talking to an audience. Yeah. Oh, well, don't be insecure. He's just let me talk over you. A secure man would

(4:20:01) do that, right, Mark? What do you mean? No. Well, you wouldn't want it. A secure man would have confidence to be

(4:20:06) able to talk. So, you're insane. a secure man. So, should a secure man when

(4:20:12) he asks a question have the actual question he asked answered? Look, Andrew, you are the biggest

(4:20:18) [ __ ] douchebag. So, we got to go to the next one. This one from AJ says, "How does Mark feel about

(4:20:24) a 40-year-old being in a relationship with an 18year-old?"

(4:20:31) Um, I don't really feel anything about it. Um, I think that it's a bit of a age

(4:20:36) gap. I'm not sure it'd be the best for them to maintain a healthy relationship. But um if she's the age of consent and

(4:20:43) can consent and knows what she's doing, like I said, it's not for me to enforce upon others my beliefs. If it is an

(4:20:50) unhealthy relationship, then it's an unhealthy relationship. But that's none of my business. Hio, my answer to that, you spin me right

(4:20:58) round, baby. You should be every which way that you marry that 18-year-old chick as a 4-year-old. You'd be tagging

(4:21:05) her and making babies. Look at that vessel. 18 years old. She could have at least six, seven babies. You should be

(4:21:12) tagging that [ __ ] every day. It'll make you feel young. Tag the [ __ ] out of that 18-year-old bra.

(4:21:17) Can you just keep your Can you just keep your obsessive [ __ ] sexual [ __ ] out of this? Seriously, just calm down. All

(4:21:23) right. What does it have to do with me? Pio says, "Mark says Andrew is the worst human, but Mark would allow his

(4:21:28) 18-year-old daughter to become an Only Fans model. I know who I think is the worst human."

(4:21:34) Yeah, I don't I don't control my daughter like some fundamentalist jackoff that wants to basically lock her

(4:21:41) in her room. Yeah. How How's that working out for you, Christians? How's that How's that going? You winning with that one?

(4:21:46) Airborne Animal says, "Mark is definitely going to have a cry session after this." No, I'm on actually there's an after

(4:21:53) show on Max's channel. So, I'm going to go over to the after show. We can talk about how it was, you know, who who

(4:21:59) actually was trying to engage honestly and who wasn't. Um, yeah. So, there is an after show on Max's, which is uh

(4:22:05) Sherba Mate and um I think we can uh I'll get the link for you, James. If you could pop it in the chat, I'd really

(4:22:12) appreciate it. Gladly. Mike says, "Marine Corps combat vet. Can't tell you how many Marines went in as atheists,

(4:22:19) then during combat found God." Ironic, huh? Can I have a hat, Andrew?

(4:22:25) It actually works the other way around. A lot of also um Christians go in there and see things problem of evil atheists.

(4:22:32) So, it's actually and I must say that atheists are actually growing faster than Christians. So, you know, spay no

(4:22:37) one away. Andrew's listening to what is love in his ear earbud. So God, what is it?

(4:22:45) Gourdzilla says Mark L. Uh they say how many L's can you

(4:22:51) possibly take in one night, Mark? Uh what? Like seriously, that's all

(4:22:57) you've got? Okay, sure. I mean, you're entitled to your opinion. I don't I don't see why I'd tell you what your opinion is, but yeah, go for it.

(4:23:03) Brandon Schmidt says, "Just saying hello to Andrew. Huge fan.

(4:23:09) Reaper CDL says, "If a mother has the right the right to abort or not, then should men be able to sign away

(4:23:14) financial responsibility? Mark stances on mandatory DNA testing at birth?" What

(4:23:20) do you think if uh of that Mark? Uh well, I I think that alimony should

(4:23:26) be paid to the person that bothered the child or the person that fathered the child should pay alimony if it's with the woman. If it's with the man, then

(4:23:32) the woman should pay to the man. believe in sort of an equal equal share of responsibility for a child. I don't have

(4:23:38) a problem with it. Um, if that requires a parental test, then sure. But a lot of men will just go, "Hey, you know, I was

(4:23:44) with her. I was the only one with her. Cool. That's that's my child. I don't see what the problem is." Scabby says, "Mark,

(4:23:50) unless you're dodging alimony and then [ __ ] you, I guess, cuz seriously, what what the hell are you doing?"

(4:23:55) Says, "Mark, you do realize you've interrupted this entire debate. Also, you've called Andrew far more names than

(4:24:01) he's called you. You're delusional. Not true. Absolutely not true. Not true.

(4:24:06) Gabriel Valencia. And I'm not saying I didn't call names, but I only did so once Andrew started. He always starts this then complains

(4:24:13) about where it goes. So sad. So bad. Gabriel says Mark, quote, they say, Mark

(4:24:19) says, quote, "As terrible as Andrew's demeanor has been, I would never go back to atheism based on your arguments. They

(4:24:26) lead to absurd absurdities and atrocities." Well, this is secular humanism. I wasn't

(4:24:32) actually talking about atheism, which is a belief position on whether God exists. So, it's actually not much to do with

(4:24:37) humanism. Um, it's only tangentially related to secular humanism. So, you know, maybe learn what atheism actually

(4:24:44) is would be a good idea. But, you know, if if you're basing what you believe on

(4:24:50) the performance of somebody in a debate, what you doing? You got it. This one from do appreciate

(4:24:57) it. Jacob Vanzant says, "That's an angry Mark." Uh, let's see. Mero 409 says,

(4:25:04) "Mark says, Andrew is a pig." Um, I wouldn't say I wouldn't say angry, just frustrated. Like I I like to be

(4:25:10) able to talk and not have some horrible person interrupt me. Yeah. But I think most people would agree with that. I

(4:25:16) think you would agree with that, right? So, yeah. This one from Dan Vicious says, "Mark is

(4:25:23) disingenuous. can't say it's bad faith when he only believes his own agnostic soypism, claims science, and wants to

(4:25:30) trans the kids. Sicko. Yeah, I I am not a soypist and I don't

(4:25:36) want to trans all the kids. It's just we've got to do something about um you know, the the the problems that they're

(4:25:42) having. And hey, guess what? Christianity ain't working. So, you know, hey, you you can say whatever you

(4:25:48) want. That's fine. Works fine.

(4:25:53) Sharp skills says Mark built his house out of straw and the big bad smoky man

(4:26:00) blew it down with ease. Oh, the big big big Ash Wednesday didn't actually build

(4:26:06) a house at all. He had no foundation. He didn't even present a foundation. He just brushed it away and said, "No, I

(4:26:12) don't have to. It doesn't have a foundation." So, it doesn't have a foundation at all. It's gone. What's amazing is that my foundation is

(4:26:19) your foundation. Thank you, Mark. You don't have a foundation. You never That's right. That's right. Just like

(4:26:25) you, Mark. My foundation is your foundation. So, if I don't have a foundation, Mark,

(4:26:33) this one from Renhawk for Andrew. If the ideal Christian political system is monarchy, how can citizens of a kingdom

(4:26:39) enact political change without resorting to violence? Uh, it's a constitutional monarchy,

(4:26:44) meaning that the um It said this question was for Andrew. Oh, did it? It did.

(4:26:50) Mark, that was very, very You should apologize for that, Mark. That was very rude of you to interrupt like that.

(4:26:56) James, could you repeat the question? Yeah, Mark. Yeah, Mark.

(4:27:02) Just teasing. I like I appreciate both of you guys being here. They say, "For Andrew, if the ideal Christian political system is monarchy, how can citizens of

(4:27:09) a kingdom enact political change without resorting to violence?" Well, that's not the ideal system.

(4:27:17) What is? Well, that's a interesting thing about Christian ethics. Christian

(4:27:22) ethics can exist within any system. If you're asking about appropriation for

(4:27:28) specific problems, I could actually uh cite each system as having some examples

(4:27:33) of being able to at least at the governmental level solve at least some problems. Now, uh could monarchy operate

(4:27:41) and exist in a way that is moral? Yes. You ask what the best system was. What

(4:27:47) you think the best system was? You're not answering. Yeah. Yeah. The best system is Christian ethics. When you're talking about a

(4:27:53) government, the best political system. Yeah. We're talking about that's political systems. That is subjective and arbitrary. I

(4:28:00) don't know that you could point to a single political system and say that it's perfect. We're talking about

(4:28:06) Christian ethics here, though. If you're talking about Christian ethics, I think that if you had a just king under

(4:28:12) Christian ethics, it's just as good as having a just democracy. I do think that democracy has its fair share of problems

(4:28:19) and their major problems in comparison to uh monarchies, but I think monarchies have some problems too. The truth is the

(4:28:27) reflection of the government is always going to reflect the morality of the population. Right now we have an immoral

(4:28:33) population and so we have an immoral government. Secularists move us more towards secularism. And the government

(4:28:39) is exactly the reflection of what you would expect it to be. IMO by your standards.

(4:28:47) It's not good for human flourishing. It hasn't been good for human flourishing at all. Really? We live in the best of times

(4:28:53) over the entire, you know, human history. Yeah. That has to do with technology,

(4:28:58) not your [ __ ] ethics. Prove it. Yeah. Okay, I'll prove it. All the

(4:29:04) things that you would point to right this second for the standard of living for the average human that makes it

(4:29:10) better for us has nothing to do with secularism has to do with technology. Is that true or false?

(4:29:15) You mean like social mobility and freedom and things like that? No. Social mobility and freedom in the 1700s did that include slaves?

(4:29:24) No. No. Yeah. Shut up, dude. Dumb ass. We have a lot more freedom. We have a

(4:29:30) lot more opportunity. We have all of these things. has nothing to do with secularism.

(4:29:35) Oh, nothing to do with secularism. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Oh, yeah. Show me.

(4:29:41) Oh, so um the idea that only people of a certain religion can hold public office.

(4:29:48) That now being changed to hey, anybody can hold public office irrelevant of a religion. That's got nothing to do with

(4:29:54) secularism. Is that what you're talking about? That has not made society better. It has. Yes. Show me how. Oh, it's made it worse for

(4:30:01) the Christians, but it's made it better. So, it's made society worse. He's not a Christian. And most people aren't Christians, so

(4:30:06) it's made society worse, right? No, most people aren't Christians where I live. No. So, okay. But where most people in the

(4:30:13) world aren't Christian, but where I live, they are. And by the way, I bet you where you live they are too. Show me, tell me the country you

(4:30:19) live in, and let's see if most of them identify as being Christian. What's the country called? Australia.

(4:30:25) Oh, Australia. Let's find out. Australia. Uh-huh. uh Christian population.

(4:30:31) Uh-huh. Let's find out, shall we? Let's see. Um

(4:30:38) 52.1%. Now I Can you help me, sir? Is 52%

(4:30:44) more? Is 52% a majority or no? Oh, barely. And what's the no religion?

(4:30:51) So that So then yes. So what's the no religion in Australia? Let's let's look it up. Yeah, let's let's go over it.

(4:31:00) Shall we? Uh, oh, I'm sorry. I was wrong. Christian, 68.0%. 68% in Australia. In Australia, now I'm just

(4:31:07) going to point this out. In Australia, 43.9% of the population identified as Christianity 21 census.

(4:31:14) So, the minority. Yeah. Identify as Christian. Yeah. So, the minority.

(4:31:21) Identified as Christian. Yeah. Yeah. So, no, no, no, no, no. I'm looking at the latest stats. Okay. It's

(4:31:27) 60. It's 68% that I'm seeing. What are you looking at? Tell me what

(4:31:33) you're looking at. I'll go to I don't know what year you are. What year is that from? Uh this is I'm looking at is from 2021.

(4:31:40) I couldn't imagine that it would radically change from four years. Okay. Well, let me share my screen. I want to I want to show you this. This is

(4:31:46) this is awesome. This is absolutely awesome. I love this. I love this. This is wonderful. Give me one sec. I'll

(4:31:53) share that. Have we got it? Yep. Yeah. So, in 2001, Christianity at

(4:31:59) 68%. Oh. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. 43.9%.

(4:32:06) Wait a second. So, wait. I Oh my god. This is crazy. I think you got me, bro.

(4:32:12) So, Australia right now is better than it was when Christians were in the majority, right?

(4:32:19) Yes. Oh, and and what things are better in Australia?

(4:32:24) What do you mean? We we don't have um um so much of an oppressive government. We've got a uh

(4:32:30) You don't have an oppressive government. They took all your [ __ ] guns. They took all your guns, bro.

(4:32:36) Yeah. How is that not oppressive? They didn't take all the guns. They took them all. What can you even

(4:32:42) own? Okay. Can you stop talking about a place that you don't even know where it is on a map? Can I Can I speak about my own

(4:32:49) [ __ ] country or do you think you're an authority on that as well? In actual fact, the majority of the population was

(4:32:55) for for a lot stricter gun control. Now, you can still have a gun. You just need to go through a lot to get one. And you

(4:33:02) know, we have restrictions on what people do. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. And you know how And how many

(4:33:08) massacres has your country had lately as opposed to mine? Uh, well, it depends if we're talking

(4:33:14) about how many people How many school shootings has Australia had in the last 10 years?

(4:33:20) Uh, well, I'm not I'm not sure. Tell me. None. Zero. In the last 10 years, I want to make

(4:33:26) sure that How many has happened in America? How many has happened in America?

(4:33:32) Oh, I mean, tons. Tons. Oh, but it's so much better. Even though you've got to give your kid a

(4:33:38) backpack in order to go to school with Kevlar, you don't have to because somebody might

(4:33:43) Oh, yeah. No. Who cares about the children? You care about the children, but who cares about the children?

(4:33:49) So, do you realize that most shootings of people in the United States do not

(4:33:54) happen with rifles, but with handguns, mostly from minority communities? Do you understand that your chances of

(4:34:01) getting killed by a rifle in the United States are less than your chances of getting beaten to death with hands and

(4:34:06) feet? Hands and feet happens, right? And by the way, can I just point this out? Well, just a second. Can I just for a

(4:34:15) second? How's that freedom? Can I get your say tell me that you were wrong about the

(4:34:20) majority religion in Australia? You are wrong. Can you just acknowledge that now? You do realize that was a trap, right,

(4:34:26) dummy? Well, well done. You played yourself. No, you played yourself. How do you have

(4:34:31) more freedoms? You outlawed all. How do I have more freedoms? Yeah. As you became more secular, how do

(4:34:37) I I don't I don't know why it's about freedoms. It's about the well-being of the people. It's all about authoritarianism

(4:34:44) leading to the greatness of humanity, leading to the flourishing of humanity.

(4:34:49) We can tell you what you can can't own. You can't even own a [ __ ] gun. Okay, you secularist.

(4:34:57) You're wrong. You can't even read a map. And you have no idea. never seen people

(4:35:03) talking about it like you're an authority when people in Australia are happy and chill and and you know they

(4:35:09) don't have to worry about their kids being shot. Yeah. No, you you've got freedom and you have to watch your kids

(4:35:15) get shot. Oh, what a happy day. Happy day. And and this guy doesn't even care. He doesn't give a crap. Well done. Well

(4:35:21) done. So, so I just want to make sure you as a secular humanist support banning the right of your fellow

(4:35:28) countrymen to be able to defend themselves against an authoritarian government.

(4:35:33) What are you talking about? How can your countrymen defend themselves against an authoritarian government if they don't have guns?

(4:35:40) We we just don't we basically stand up to an authoritarian government. You know, you think that the government is

(4:35:47) going to, you know, we don't worry about the government turning into this authoritarian thing that locks us all

(4:35:53) up. Do you think a government can rule without the consent of the population?

(4:35:58) Yes. Because I'm not [ __ ] stupid and I can look at half the world. Yes, absolutely.

(4:36:07) How are you going to stand up to your authoritarian [ __ ] government without guns, sir? How?

(4:36:13) Well, it it's called like um rebellion with what? Bad language.

(4:36:19) There's not there's not no gun. What are you going to go out and do? Shout at them?

(4:36:24) The worst opinion. What do you think the the Australian army is going to turn on its own people, its own brothers and

(4:36:30) sisters and family members? Is that Oh, wow. Okay. Okay. And by the way, can I give you a point

(4:36:36) of reference for that? CO 19 when people were only following orders with the mandates, weren't they?

(4:36:42) including your law enforcement when they were forcing people into their homes. They shut their businesses down using

(4:36:48) the authority of the state. They did everything they could [ __ ] do. They mobilized the entire state against you and you had no recourse. You [ __ ]

(4:36:54) cowards. And we we marched to our [ __ ] government buildings armed to the [ __ ] teeth. And guess what? We

(4:37:01) got those locks. No. Oh yeah. So you took a gun and threatened your government.

(4:37:07) That's exactly what happened in the state of Michigan. Look it up. Wow. Okay. Well, look it up right now.

(4:37:12) They went down with arms to the state building and took it over. It's my time to talk, but since you're

(4:37:18) talking, cuz you didn't know that, cuz you're dumb. For a start, hey, could you shut the [ __ ] up for one second?

(4:37:23) You shut the [ __ ] up, girl. [ __ ] No, you shut the [ __ ] up. Shut the [ __ ] up. Um, for a start, the majority, the

(4:37:30) vast majority of people were in favor of those lockdowns because it helped people. And I might add that you

(4:37:37) actually lost so many lives because of your stubbornness and stupidity while we

(4:37:43) didn't. And so all of those people that lost people, you're like, "Oh, well, I know better because I've got a [ __ ]

(4:37:48) gun and a [ __ ] moron." Well done, you idiot. Tyranny of the Oh, how are you going to stop the

(4:37:54) tyrannical government? I'll just sacrifice these people because I don't give a [ __ ] Well done. You absolutely

(4:38:01) [ __ ] What is the tyranny of the majority? The thing is that after that ended, the lockdown lifted. They're not being

(4:38:07) tyrannical cuz you're an idiot. And you don't understand anything. What is the tyranny of the majority?

(4:38:13) We still have lockdowns. Do we still have lockdowns, Andrew? Do we still have lock? No, we don't. You [ __ ]

(4:38:19) You don't. We don't. No, you [ __ ] idiot. No. Oh, I'm so I'm super confused.

(4:38:24) I'm super Hang on. I'm super confused. [ __ ] [ __ ] You you don't have lockdowns? No.

(4:38:29) So you can go buy whatever gun you want. Oh, that's a lock down. Is that I can go

(4:38:34) lock down from hang out. I can go to the park. I can go wherever I want. But I can't like I can't tell you. Guess what,

(4:38:41) Andrew? I can apply for a permit and I can apply to get a gun

(4:38:46) permit. Oh, you can apply for So you were [ __ ] completely wrong. Oh, you're going to apply for a permit.

(4:38:52) Completely wrong about lockdowns like a dumbass. Like a [ __ ] dumbass. You double your right to a permit.

(4:38:59) Get a gun. So your right to a permit. Your whole country is under lock down

(4:39:05) argument. You idiot, sir. Your whole country is under the lockdown of the state right now. Your right to a

(4:39:10) permit out of your shall not be infringed. That's not our constitution, you [ __ ]

(4:39:16) [ __ ] Yeah, I know. Because you have what's called a tyranny of the majority. What is that? What is the tyranny of the

(4:39:22) majority? I'm sorry, Andrew. Is is there like armed ICE agents out on our streets? No,

(4:39:28) there's not. Is there? Is there school shootings? Is there shootings of people? Is there police killing our citizens

(4:39:34) every single day? No, there's not, Andrew, is there? No, that's your [ __ ] up country with it [ __ ] up healthcare

(4:39:41) and it [ __ ] up rules. And you want to go, "Oh, well, we're the best." Even as your your country moves soldiers into

(4:39:48) states to stop anybody protesting. Well [ __ ] done. When we go out to protest,

(4:39:54) we don't have to take rifles because we're [ __ ] allowed to, you [ __ ] You have no idea what my country is like and

(4:40:01) want to talk authoratively about a place you've never seen, never lived, and don't can't even find on a [ __ ] map.

(4:40:08) You [ __ ] threaten. I can't find Australia on a map. You didn't know where it was.

(4:40:14) I don't even think it exists. But if it did, can you tell me about the Abos?

(4:40:20) it. Hey, that's that's Hey, that's that's like the N word. J, can you tell me about the Tell me about

(4:40:26) the and it's not like the N word. That's a lie. He's lying. They call them abos all

(4:40:32) the time. It absolutely is. That is highly You're a liar. That's progressive

(4:40:38) [ __ ] You're a liar. Tell me about Tell me about those people in your nation who you have your own ICE

(4:40:45) agents go in. It's your own form of it in order to collectivize these people so that they don't sniff [ __ ] gasoline.

(4:40:52) Tell me about it. Tell me about their songs about not sniffing [ __ ] petrol. Please don't sniff petrol. Tell me about

(4:40:59) how great your [ __ ] country is. Okay, that's that's offensive as [ __ ] That is whatever

(4:41:07) about not sniffing. Let me prove it. Yeah, prove it. You absolute racist. You are so racist.

(4:41:13) That's not racist. Okay, that is absolutely racist. It's not racist. They call him that. So racist that we don't absolutely not.

(4:41:22) Look at this. Look, I've shared my screen. Yeah. Aborigy. Aboriginal offensive slang.

(4:41:28) Because of its highly offensive nature, this word is I don't accept that source as being correct. Pull up the Britannica's

(4:41:34) dictionary. Pull up the Bratannica. Pull up the Britannica. Why Bratannica? That's not

(4:41:40) because that's the one that I consider the source. That's correct. pull up. Oh, [ __ ] you. You racist. You absolute

(4:41:47) racist. Yeah. So, tell me

(4:41:53) yourself. Pardon my interruption. Uh, so let's just because YouTube will

(4:41:58) probably ding it. Let's just say uh native people. I don't know. But

(4:42:04) what's the point? So, Andrew, I think you're saying that like there are people that are native peoples that

(4:42:12) Australia is having uh like they're legally stopping them from smelling

(4:42:17) gasoline. What was it? Yeah. So, the point is just to say that

(4:42:22) he's under what's called the tyranny of the majority. The whole point of the Second Amendment of the United States is so that we were never under the tyranny

(4:42:28) of the majority. So that we could defend ourselves against a tyrannical government. The same government that he

(4:42:34) would claim goes to the Abos and literally oppresses them. Literally oppresses them.

(4:42:39) No, no, no, no, no. Now, you you show me the definition in Britannica where it

(4:42:45) says it's totally fine. You show me where it's not insulting or a slang or offensive. Go for it. Well, any word that Bratannica is an

(4:42:52) encyclopedia, not a dictionary. You do realize that, don't you? Encyclopedia. Bratannica.

(4:42:58) Do you realize that most definitions are proprietary? And so you look at the ethmology of the word so that you can come up with the definition.

(4:43:06) [ __ ] racist, man. You racist. Yeah, you have nothing. You have nothing, do you? No, you racist [ __ ] You're a racist

(4:43:12) [ __ ] How to how? Look, I'm not even part of that culture. How could I say something which was racist? I don't even

(4:43:17) understand. I'm not part of the American culture. I still wouldn't throw the nword out there. You racist prick. Because I'm guessing in your country

(4:43:23) that's considered racist. [ __ ] in my country as well. Yeah. Absolut Wow. Okay. if they

(4:43:29) All right, we're not gonna talk about that people group uh at least if we're

(4:43:35) using that word because I do think YouTube will probably ding us. So, we're going to use uh we're going to go to

(4:43:41) these super chats. Cooko says, "You spin me right round, baby. Right, round like a record, baby. Right, round."

(4:43:49) Nick Bron says, "Andrew, I am number one super fan, longtime supporter, and greatest super chatter of all time, but

(4:43:54) you lost this debate." Cookamo says, "The Australia

(4:44:00) the Australia today is not the great Australia that many of us grew up in." I'll give you a chance. I mean, it's

(4:44:06) pretty vague, but if you want to respond, Mark, really in a super fast way. Yeah, I I I'm I'm happy to respond. I

(4:44:12) also think that a lot of the problems with the uh native Australian people are because of Christianity coming in and

(4:44:18) well, slaughtering them, and that's something we've got to live with, something we've got to acknowledge. And um yeah, I think that Australia is going

(4:44:24) actually pretty fine. I mean, you may have issues with the way it's going. I'm not saying it's perfect, but I certainly think that sort of getting rid of guns

(4:44:31) is one of the best things we ever did. And guess what? Like, something like 80 90% of the population actually agree

(4:44:36) with that. It's overwhelming support for it. So, don't tell us how to live our lives. And, you know, [ __ ] off.

(4:44:42) Seriously. Oh, well, they they to be fair, their currency was Australian dollars, but

(4:44:48) Mason Miller. Yeah. Yeah. I got you. I got you, mate. I I'm I'm fine with the way my country's going. You may disagree, but you know,

(4:44:53) I'm I'm totally fine. I think it's great. Mason Miller says, "A question I've had about the birth rate crisis

(4:45:00) uh could make it much worse. If they are counting the elderly that already had

(4:45:06) children, then the birth rate for the current generations would be much worse."

(4:45:11) Um, let me read that one more time because I'm not sure what it meant. A question I've had about the birth rate

(4:45:17) crisis could make it much worse. If they are counting the elderly that already had kids, then the birth rate for the

(4:45:24) current generations would be much worse. It's true. Well, not only that, but you

(4:45:30) got to remember that Mark refuses to acknowledge that this is a cyclical problem. If we have elderly right now

(4:45:38) who are now boomers, the next is going to be Gen X and the next going to be millennials and then it it's an ongoing

(4:45:44) issue. Even if it was the case and I were to grant it that the only reason that this is an issue is because there's not enough young to take care of the

(4:45:50) old, then this would still be a cyclical issue unless you got the birth rate up. I don't know why Dum Dum over here

(4:45:56) doesn't get that. He just thinks, oh, I'm not interested in anything you've got to say. You could Oh my god, you offended me, Andrew.

(4:46:03) Now, I think this again, this is a slippery slope argument. No, you're a piece of racist piece of [ __ ] Shut the

(4:46:08) [ __ ] up. What am I saying? You don't deserve to be like even listened to. You are a disgusting scum and should be

(4:46:15) treated accordingly. You absolute douchebag. Yeah. Why don't you throw the N word out? Why don't you throw the N word out?

(4:46:21) You super Sorry guys. This one from Early Bird 2248 says, "Like chess, once you accept

(4:46:28) the goal checkmate, some moves are objectively better. In morality, if we value well-being, certain actions are

(4:46:35) objectively better, too." I think this is the second or third time I've read it. He He thinks that I didn't read it,

(4:46:40) but go ahead if you want to respond. Yeah. Do you Well, just real quick,

(4:46:46) Mark, do you understand? I have a different culture than you. In my culture, saying that word doesn't mean

(4:46:52) anything. It doesn't mean anything. It's only in your culture that you get offended. I don't give a

(4:46:58) Okay, we got it. You got it. We You You've made your point. But we do for this guy. He's going to have an aneurysm

(4:47:04) because I've read it. This is the fourth time. Uh he says like chess once you accept the goal parenthesis checkmate

(4:47:12) some moves are objectively better in morality if we value well-being certain actions are objectively better too.

(4:47:19) They're not objectively better. This is the thing right you could say that objectively these moves could um end in

(4:47:27) a better result. Better is a different term than that. Better is a different term than result. It's a different term.

(4:47:34) Is it better to win the game or is it better to lose the game? That's what better would get into. Not whether or

(4:47:41) not objectively you would win with X move. That's that's not that has nothing

(4:47:46) to do with better. This one coming in from Rachel Wilson says, "Mark, you gruesome son of a

(4:47:52) bitch." I made that part up. She said, "Mark, you are the one who said Australia has a less I'm sorry, brother.

(4:47:59) I just I'm getting I like you guys." No, I didn't I didn't make that out. But I've said Australia was what now?

(4:48:05) He said, "Mark, you were the one who said that Australia has a less tyrannical government now than they did in the past." LOL. You got cooked, bro.

(4:48:15) Yeah. Do you know like we still have laws where you have to go for you know practice on here and you had to do um

(4:48:20) you know conscription on military and things like that. Vietnam war there was conscription. Yeah. Do we have a way

(4:48:25) less tyrannical government? Yeah. I mean, I don't know what is more tyrannical than taking your population against their will, handing them a gun,

(4:48:31) and then going sending them away to fight in one of America's wars. Yeah, that's great. Well done. Well done.

(4:48:38) This one from uh this one.

(4:48:44) Goat hub said, "James big guns one. Thank you. Bless your heart." Lord Sneak says, "Australian immigration is way

(4:48:50) more strict than the US. In fact, you send people to an offshore prison."

(4:48:56) Mark. Yeah. And I I absolutely am against that. I think that the the uh intention

(4:49:02) the detention centers are absolutely terrible and I have pride to fight against them all. I I can and that is

(4:49:08) for immigration and I don't think it should be done. If you're going to detain people while you check their background, I think you should at least

(4:49:15) do it in your own country and not somewhere else. You know, that is absolutely terrible. I agree. But that's

(4:49:20) the thing. Do you agree with everything your government does? No, you don't. And neither do I. But you know,

(4:49:26) that's why we have guns. Mark, you can't shut the [ __ ] up, can you? You got to interrupt. This is his tactic. He

(4:49:32) just interrupts. So yeah, I don't support some of the Well, he never shut up. That's your tactic, you know. So I have to um

(4:49:38) This one from Shabby MCabby says, "Hey, Mark. America here. Clean my jockstrap."

(4:49:44) Okay, never mind. This one from uh let's see, Mark, I'm I know. I'm sorry,

(4:49:52) brother. I look look I don't hate Americans. I like a lot of Americans. I think they're great. It's just your government has

(4:49:58) done some [ __ ] up [ __ ] Like seriously. And you know this. I meant Yeah, but I mean if we wanted to do

(4:50:03) something about it, Mark, we could. You can't. You can only go in there and be like, "Now, now please don't hurt us with your

(4:50:10) guns." [ __ ] pathetic. [ __ ] pathetic.

(4:50:16) Mark, you can't do [ __ ] That's conducive to human force. You can't even own a gun. Sure we can.

(4:50:22) Oh yeah. If you go through all the If you go through every rigma roll on the planet, you can only then get a single

(4:50:28) shot revol. It's ridiculous. You could never in a million years take on your

(4:50:33) own government. You're a bunch of [ __ ] slaves and surfs. You can't do [ __ ] Mark.

(4:50:39) And you don't know [ __ ] Reunions are very strong here. And when we decide to um stop working, it is usually a like

(4:50:46) all of the population. Do you think you can run? They can force you to work, Mark. They can force you to work, can they?

(4:50:51) Yeah. With guns. Yeah. Yeah. What if we still don't work? Uh well, does that work in North Korea?

(4:50:59) Does it work in North Korea? When they come out with their AK-47s, they say get to [ __ ] work. Do they go no, we're

(4:51:05) No, we're not going to work. No, we say [ __ ] no. Yeah. You don't understand it. Yeah, except you don't say [ __ ] no.

(4:51:12) What you doing? Give them your guns and your rights cuz you're [ __ ] Australians are being renowned for being

(4:51:17) You're a bunch of [ __ ] and you bow your head and you gave it all up, Mark. You're [ __ ] What are you talking

(4:51:23) about? You're a bunch of [ __ ] No. What are you talking about? You gave them all your rights. Let's go to the next question. This one.

(4:51:29) You don't know anything. You're talking out of your ass. What part of you can't own gun? I can own what I want. Are you not understand?

(4:51:36) I can own a gun. Yeah. What kind? What's the best gun you can own? My handgun.

(4:51:42) Yeah. It's going to be a semi-automatic probably. Yeah. Oh. Oh, you can own a semi-automatic

(4:51:48) handgun. I' I've never looked at owning a gun. I don't Yeah. Yeah. You don't even [ __ ] know. You don't even know what you can owning.

(4:51:54) Next one. Christopher Scott. Yeah. I've never looked at owning Sorry to do this. Christopher Scott says, "You don't need armed ICE agents

(4:52:01) cuz you live in an [ __ ] penal colony that no one wants to immigrate to." Um,

(4:52:07) I would guess you disagree, Mark. Well, I I don't know. why immigration rates are actually high. A lot of people

(4:52:13) want to move here. And it's funny, no one wants to go to America at the moment. I wonder why. It's because of [ __ ] like like Andrew Wilson.

(4:52:20) Congratulations. You're the laughing stock of the world. Look at him there. Self-satisfied little

(4:52:25) grin. Okay. Yeah. We don't need guns. Imagine living without that fear. You got to go to the next one.

(4:52:32) Techno zero says Andrew asked him about the unvaxed concentration camps in

(4:52:38) Australia. Noir. What does that mean?

(4:52:43) Uh, that's that's how we say no. We go no. No, mate. No, mate.

(4:52:48) Oh, okay. Yeah, there wasn't any concentration camps there. There wasn't. It's just that hey, if you didn't have a

(4:52:55) vaccination. Yeah. No, there's no no This is some of the crap that they pedled around. We didn't have concentration camps. There

(4:53:01) was lockdowns. Absolutely. I wouldn't lie. Yeah, there was. Um if you basically we had what's called a bone

(4:53:06) head law that if you wanted to be a bone head and put other people at risk then you would be charged you it was against

(4:53:12) the law. Um you would get a vacation. How could you how would you put them at risk?

(4:53:18) By not getting vaccinated. Do we really want to have this conversation? I just want to know how you would put them at risk.

(4:53:23) Well by spreading a disease. So by not being vaccinated. Well you didn't let me finish because

(4:53:29) you're a douchebag. I'm just asking. Yeah. So if you didn't get the vaccination, there would be some public

(4:53:34) events that you couldn't go for, but it wouldn't basically mean that they, you know, they were in concentration camps.

(4:53:40) I mean, what the [ __ ] are you talking about? Like seriously, this is some of the stupidity that we hear from these idiots. Like, oh, it's a concentr. No,

(4:53:46) that's where you gather a group of people like they are doing for the Latino people in America and put them in

(4:53:52) one place under lock and key. You know, when you're in your own home, it's not a concentration camp. Come on now. Uh did

(4:53:59) they did they put anybody who was unvaccinated and did they intern them against their will? Mark

(4:54:05) did they because they were because they were unvaccinated? I I I don't think so. I mean with the

(4:54:12) lockdowns they basically couldn't you know you you had to go only for essentials like food and water and

(4:54:18) things like that. But no. So against their will. Sure. Yeah.

(4:54:23) Yeah. Yeah. So then the government, what you're really advocating for is that the government can impose against your will.

(4:54:29) Being able to force something in your body that you don't want and that you don't even have the ability to fight back. Boy, I love the secular humanism,

(4:54:36) Mark. Let's get more of that. You weren't forced. Yeah. What happens if you violated it?

(4:54:42) You may have restrictions placed upon you. And what if he didn't What if he didn't obey those restrictions?

(4:54:47) You'd be arrested. Then force. That's not force. That's That is force. That's your choice.

(4:54:53) Oh. So, so wait a sec. Okay, Mark, that's fine. I'll surround your house with a bunch of guys and say you can't leave your house, but it's your choice.

(4:55:01) What do you mean surround your house with a bunch of guys? What? If I surround your house with a bunch of guys with guns in

(4:55:06) If I surround your house with a bunch of guys with guns and say you can't leave your house and if you do this will happen and you leave and that house

(4:55:12) dystopian cuckoo land you come from this conspiracy cuckoo land but like surround

(4:55:18) your house like what kind of dystopian future [ __ ] kind of dystopian future is take this or

(4:55:24) else we'll [ __ ] arrest you if you don't comply. Yeah, just well there was a pandemic and now it's over and everyone can go do

(4:55:30) that. That sounds like a [ __ ] dystopian future, Mark. Well, it's not a future because it's over, you [ __ ] idiot.

(4:55:36) Yeah. So, it already h So, the future came and went. Your own dystopia. You couldn't even defend yourself because you're unarmed weaklings.

(4:55:44) No, it's because the majority, the overwhelming majority wanted exactly that to happen, you [ __ ] idiot.

(4:55:49) Tyranny of the majority. If the overwhelming majority wanted slavery there, would that be okay, Mark?

(4:55:55) No. No. Oh, no. Okay. Okay. So, I guess the majority isn't the arbiter of morality,

(4:56:00) is it? Stupid. Let's go to the next question. Mirro 409 says, "Don't." Like I said, it's fine as long as you're

(4:56:06) harming others. If you want to go out and make other people sick and potentially kill them, then you're a [ __ ] monster and you don't get to do

(4:56:13) that. The time of religion is saying, "Hey, you get to do all of those things because, hey, I've got a God." That's

(4:56:19) over. You don't get that anymore. We will base it upon whether it is good for people or bad for people. And you can

(4:56:24) sit in the corner and cry that you don't have your church and your God and your your son and your

(4:56:31) imaginary friend that you can have guns. Forgive me. Airborne Animal says, "Did

(4:56:38) Mark actually argue that the lockdowns actually save lives?" That is not what the science says. Humpty Dumpty had a

(4:56:46) great fall. All his insults and cope couldn't make his arguments coherent again.

(4:56:53) Uh yeah, they did save lives absolutely. We had a very very low death rate per capita in comparison to other countries

(4:56:58) and my c my state which actually blocked off all travel in and out in the state had an incredibly low rate. So and this

(4:57:06) I worry about your platform James because what they're doing is spreading medical misinformation around the place.

(4:57:11) They're basically lying about the medical things and um you know I'd love them to look up how many people died in

(4:57:17) America but you know they can't accept it because they're morons. I think there to be fair they might be referring to

(4:57:23) there was like a study I don't know if it was including Australian cities but there was at least

(4:57:30) one city from like a highly reputable university that I think said that like lockdowns didn't seem to save any lives.

(4:57:38) I think it was in American cities. I don't know if it was only American cities. So, it's I mean YouTube might

(4:57:47) say that we're like breaking the rules, but I remember I can't remember what university, but there was like a highly

(4:57:53) reputable one that said that it didn't save lives, but it might be the case

(4:57:59) that it was only like American cities, so it might not be generalizable to

(4:58:05) Australian ones. John, I don't know. I'm not familiar with this study. But this one from Mason Miller

(4:58:12) says, "To clarify, if the elderly in South Korea had a birth rate of 2.0 and was counted towards the 7, then the real

(4:58:19) birth rate is even more catastrophic. Extrapolate to every country with the

(4:58:25) problem. Why?

(4:58:30) I just I just want to point out he just threatened your platform, James. He just said with all this medical mis I worry

(4:58:35) about your platform, James, with all this medical misinformation." That's a That's a signal. That's a signal to

(4:58:41) report your platform. That's what you're doing. You [ __ ] Yeah, it is. You [ __ ] liar. You [ __ ] lying sack of

(4:58:46) [ __ ] It's exactly what it is. You just signal people to go report James. Don't [ __ ] lie to me, [ __ ]

(4:58:52) No. No. I'm No. Yeah. Hey. No. No. Absolutely. I'm I've said

(4:58:59) this on other atheist channels. So, is that a signal as well? No. What you said on other atheist?

(4:59:04) Oh, it isn't. What you said on other atheist channels was that they were spreading misinformation.

(4:59:10) Did you say on other atheist channels they were spreading misinformation? Yes. So that was a signal then to report

(4:59:16) them. Yes. Worried about You're not worried. You're giving a signal. You're giving a dog whistle.

(4:59:21) You're dog whistling. You're just dog whistling. You're dog whistling to tell your audience to mass report.

(4:59:28) You think we don't know leftist? I didn't want to talk. Yeah, it's a dog whistle. Bringing it up. You asked whistle [ __ ]

(4:59:35) It was a dog whistle to bring it up. No, it wasn't. You asked absolute moronic

(4:59:41) stupid unintelligent. You just as [ __ ] I'm really worried about your platform

(4:59:47) that people will get you for spreading misinformation, but don't do that. My audience tell

(4:59:53) Shut up, bro. We know. We know. We know. Oh, so you're not spreading medical

(4:59:58) misinformation? No. No. So what what have you said that that is true and is medically supported

(5:00:04) that you can't own guns? No, but you said do you think people like I don't

(5:00:12) stupid. You're basically saying people shouldn't be vaccinated. That's never said it. When did I say it? Never.

(5:00:17) You just made it up and then you threatened this guy's channel over nothing. Never even made it clear. I didn't threaten this [ __ ] channel.

(5:00:23) I didn't even want to talk about it. You brought this up. It's your [ __ ] I brought up guns, not the vaccines.

(5:00:30) Don't worry, everything's fine. We're gonna go to the next question. This one coming in from Scabby says, "Holy cow."

(5:00:38) Okay, just make fun of Mark. Uh Gavin Free Nun says, "Once you start calling

(5:00:43) people racist over a word, you've lost. Well, you lost like two hours ago, but

(5:00:49) it was the nail in the coffin." My guess, Mark, is that you would disagree with that, uh, Mark, but you know,

(5:00:58) yeah, I I think that the same reason why why he won't say the n-word. He's just fine if it's not his country. Well, I

(5:01:04) think that's a cop out and a weak flaccid position to have because you're basically saying, "Hey, I can be racist

(5:01:10) to other people on the planet, just not the people in my country." What a flaccid response. It's like how how wake

(5:01:16) and petty. Made by Jim Bob says, "Mark, is it consistent with secular ethics to

(5:01:22) establish a secular nation and not permit Christians to to enter? If yes or

(5:01:28) no, why?" No, because we don't enforce I've said this again and again, we don't enforce

(5:01:34) it on others. Basically, all religions are treated the same. We base what we think is right and wrong on independent

(5:01:40) of religion, not the assertion of authority that these guys have. I know I don't think I would like I don't get to

(5:01:45) choose people's beliefs just literally all based around authority. He wants the authority to take your guns away. He wants the authority for you to

(5:01:52) get vac vaccinated. You are really hung up on this, aren't you? The whole gun thing. Are you triggered or interrupt? What's wrong

(5:01:58) with you? Can I Can I No, it's just you're going you're not even talking about the subject. Yeah, I'm talking about the subject. Oh,

(5:02:04) it's so it's bad when I do it, is it, Andrew? It's bad when I do it, but you can be a racist piece of [ __ ] interrupt

(5:02:09) me constantly, and that's just fine. Anyway, when it comes when it comes to authority, when it comes to authority,

(5:02:14) you love authority. Hypocrite. You love authority. That's hypocrisy. You love authority while you are an

(5:02:19) absolute hypocrite. No, you don't even know what that word means, Mark. Yeah. Yeah. You don't even [ __ ] know anything about the country, you ignorant

(5:02:26) piece of [ __ ] Well, I don't even know where it is. I don't even think it exists. Where is a good idea of social responsibility? We

(5:02:33) have an idea of, hey, we have our freedoms, but we also have a responsibility to care for the rest of the people in our country. something

(5:02:39) that Andrew doesn't understand, will never understand, and is a monster because he just does not want anybody

(5:02:44) else his own church. Oh, it's fine. You interrupt me now, is it? Well, it was I was the one who was

(5:02:51) talking. What do you mean? Wait, you finished, you idiot. What are you talking about? No, I never got even a chance to

(5:02:57) respond. So, the thing is the question was for the question was for me. And so, here's the response. you have

(5:03:03) interrupted me every time the question is on me when you're so very simple. So very simple even if it is the case and

(5:03:10) I'm a hypocrite. Uh who cares? It's my my stance. Independent reason is nothing. I could

(5:03:18) be a hypocrite if I want. And not only that, Mark, here's the thing. You can't say, "I hate authority," while at the

(5:03:24) same time saying, "I love it when the state comes in, takes all our guns, and makes us get vaccines, and does whatever

(5:03:30) the state needs to do to enforce Mark's worldview with [ __ ] guns." [ __ ] you,

(5:03:35) Mark. You're the hypocrite. You're a [ __ ] tyrannical [ __ ] in the guys You're a sheep or a literal wolf in the

(5:03:42) guise of a sheep. Literally, that's Mark. Mark's I hate authority unless

(5:03:47) it's doing what I want. And then if Andrew says, "I love authority." When it's doing what I want, Mark says,

(5:03:52) "That's bad." You know, [ __ ] you, Mark. It's all [ __ ] And what you did here on this channel, that was the most

(5:03:58) [ __ ] When you're like, "James, I'm really worried about your ch." Shut up, Mark. We saw right through that [ __ ]

(5:04:03) Took us 5 seconds. I've seen you progressives do it a hundred times. You just want to get the guy banned. Stop

(5:04:09) lying, Mark. I I don't want James back. Why? I I appear on James' channel all the time.

(5:04:15) Medical misinformation. Yeah, I let you speak, but of course. Can we mute this [ __ ] idiot? Seriously.

(5:04:21) This next question, pseudonym says, "USA, USA, USA." Airborne Animal says, "Insult the US all you want, but we

(5:04:27) never lost a war against a bird." In parentheses, the emu war. Andrew Sheilar

(5:04:33) says, "Can Mark please defend mandatory voting in Australia?"

(5:04:39) Yeah, like I said, people have a social responsibility and one of the responsibilities we have is to contribute to the democracy and that is

(5:04:45) mandatory voting. You can choose not to vote. You'll just cop a fine. You know, it's your obligation to vote. That's just one of the obligations that we

(5:04:51) have. You know, you guys have obligations like you have travel at the speed limit. We have the same. You have obligations to do all kinds of things.

(5:04:57) Voting, I think, is the least you can do to contribute to your country. I think it's the bare bare minimum you can do.

(5:05:03) And I I don't know really anybody that that's against mandatory voting at all.

(5:05:08) This one coming in from do appreciate it. Christopher Scott says, "You guys are [ __ ] You lost a war to emuse.

(5:05:16) Um. Yeah. Yeah. And it's funny because we the the side that lost the war had the guns and the emus didn't. Is that

(5:05:23) hilarious or what? It's because a bunch of animal rights activists liberals stopped them from

(5:05:28) finishing the job. No, no, they ran out of ammo. You don't know what talking about. Oh, they they ran out of ammo.

(5:05:34) Mhm. So they shot so many emus that they were just out of ammo. That's why it stopped. No, no, no, no, no. Their Bren gun. They

(5:05:40) basically You don't know anything about it. I don't know. Tell me tell me all about the emu war. I can't wait to hear it. Yeah, so they took out a machine gun

(5:05:46) trying to cull the emus and the emus were a lot more agile and tougher than they expected. They couldn't actually take out as many as they expected. They

(5:05:52) had some, you know, an incredible amount of rounds, but the emus basically there were so many of them. Um, and other

(5:05:57) other actions were taken because it was not What other actions? What do you mean?

(5:06:03) Was there a bunch of animal rights activists who went [ __ ] ballistic, Mark? What in in in the 50s?

(5:06:09) Yes. In the 50s? No, no. Are you sure? I just wanted that on record.

(5:06:15) What are you talking about? Was there a bunch of crazy animal rights activists? No. No. I just want to make sure.

(5:06:21) No, no. They went with things like building fences and things like that. Actually more cost effective than than

(5:06:27) unloading a whole bunch of animals ammo on animals that weren't actually getting cut. Like seriously, dude. I think

(5:06:34) you're reading too much into this. What the hell is your Wow. What What a crazy weird. It didn't spark a massive debate

(5:06:40) about animal rights and it didn't have a mass it didn't have a massive animal rights activist. That that was the kangaroo

(5:06:47) culling you. No, that was the emu war in 1932 military campaign by Australia to control the emu population's damaging

(5:06:53) crops. Dummy, you don't know your own [ __ ] history. I do. Why did they stop shooting the emus?

(5:07:02) What? Why' they stop shooting the emus? I don't tell me why.

(5:07:07) Okay. No, you know so much about it. You tell me. I don't know. It had nothing It had nothing to do with

(5:07:12) animal rights activist. It had to do with Here we go. Sorry to do this, guys. Red Fox says, "Mark, what if some action

(5:07:18) individually gives you happiness, but in mass systematically harm society? How do

(5:07:23) you ensure your system consistently applies a standard and determines what should we do?"

(5:07:30) Uh, erotica, hookup culture, universal basic

(5:07:36) income, etc. Yeah. So I I I think there has to be a

(5:07:42) balance and like I was saying there's certain things like bodily autonomy, certain things like bodily integrity, certain things that we can't go, okay,

(5:07:49) well that's good for the society on hold. We've got to um you know oppress and and treat people horribly. Um so

(5:07:55) part of the secular humanism maintaining human dignity. So that's sort of something that we don't kind of violate.

(5:08:00) We don't we don't like it's not like don't believe Android. It's not people with guns coming up to round up people

(5:08:06) and stuff. That isn't [ __ ] happening. That's just [ __ ] that he's spewing like a [ __ ] idiot. So, um no, it's

(5:08:11) not stuff like that. It it is just we have to have a balance between what our personal wants are and what

(5:08:17) responsibility to society is. And I think that that's a balance we can certainly find um with a certain

(5:08:23) categorization of, you know, we're not going to deprive people of food because it's good for the society. No, there's

(5:08:29) certain rights that we have that we won't aced to the government. Um, which is essentially where rights come from.

(5:08:35) Okay, we're going to go to the next question. This one, we do appreciate your question as well. Arcade outpost

(5:08:42) says, "Mark, do you know Randbot? He is a way cooler Australian."

(5:08:48) I have no idea who you're talking about. All right. Rachel Wilson says, "Hey, Mark. The country with the country with

(5:08:54) the most people seeking to immigrate to it is the US. Google search it. You soy

(5:09:01) boy. I added the soy boy part. Yeah. Yeah. Fair. Cool. Yeah. Okay. Uh,

(5:09:06) you know, I know that that you know, immigrants aren't being treated particularly well. Is there any legal way to immigrate into the US? Probably

(5:09:12) not. Um, they seem to have closed that down completely. But, um, you know, the the whole idea that we're we're

(5:09:18) oppressed in some way, ridiculous. Like please if you haven't got any idea of

(5:09:23) what's going into a country please. Yeah. Like you didn't when it came to the US and immigration. So the thing is

(5:09:30) so interesting here is like why would all these immigrants want to come into this war torn battle torn country where

(5:09:35) they got to worry about their kids going to school with bulletproof backpacks. It's almost like well they flee

(5:09:42) countries where they took their guns and oppressed them like in Cuba for instance and in all these other [ __ ] places. They literally are fleeing countries

(5:09:48) like Venezuela where they did this as well. They're fleeing nations where they put the lock down on their very ability

(5:09:54) to fight back against an oppressive nation like what's happened in your country, Mark. And under secular

(5:09:59) humanism, your form of humanism, this is fine. It's fine. You You trust people so

(5:10:04) much and they're so inherently moral that you're going to take their [ __ ] guns from them. What a joke. What a

(5:10:10) joke. I think you're scared. I am scared that totalitarians will take

(5:10:16) our guns. Yeah. Yeah. You're a scared little boy. What can I say?

(5:10:22) Yeah. You're so scared you would not even trust your fellow countrymen with a rifle. With a boltaction rifle.

(5:10:27) Do you trust all of your countrymen with a boltaction? Did I say all? But I trust most of them. Yeah. Here we go. This one from Paul Morrison

(5:10:35) says, "Christian Christian charities only give to other Christians, quote unquote." They're quoting you, Mark.

(5:10:41) They say the largest Christian charity is World Vision. That's for disaster relief. They help other religions.

(5:10:48) Yeah. I didn't say only. I said that like in a study we found that atheists gave more per capita to like in a

(5:10:54) percentage proportional wise to out groupoups than Christians do. Okay. So that's what I was saying. I didn't never

(5:11:00) said, oh, all they do is give to Christians and that's the only thing they do. No, I'm aware that there are Christian charities that do good. Look,

(5:11:07) and I wouldn't take that away from them. Absolutely there are. But you know, when you make the claim, hey, Christians do

(5:11:12) more. I want to point out that hey, atheists don't have a more tendency not to take in

(5:11:18) religion into account. Yeah. But here's the thing that's so funny is like who cares if it's the case

(5:11:23) that you're giving to the church in huge demand. The church is dispensing that charity. That's what that fund is for.

(5:11:30) They call it a benevolence fund. Most churches call it a benevolence. People that stole like $4 million from

(5:11:35) their church. Like they were given were they g No secularist charity has ever

(5:11:40) embezzled. Oh no. No. I'm sure. I'm sure I'm sure that would went to the poor. Well, to the to the big Oh, I'm sure that the secularist

(5:11:46) charities which embezzled it went to the poor. Mark, stupid ass criticism. This one from this one from Rachel

(5:11:52) Wilson says, "Mark, democide, or in other words, government killing its own people was the leading cause of death

(5:11:59) worldwide after disease in the 20th century." It's true. 200 262 million deaths. And you'd think

(5:12:06) it's a conspiracy theory. Log off. No, I just know that it's not happening in

(5:12:12) Australia. Like, people aren't being killed in Australia for that cause. Like, this is the thing. You've got to

(5:12:17) understand that just because you're so scared that a government's going to rise up and and take account from you and and

(5:12:24) take all your stuff, doesn't mean that everybody in the world feels that way. That doesn't mean that you have to like

(5:12:29) just because your culture came from Britain which is basically um you know oppressed the people and was really

(5:12:36) authoritarian under the monarchy doesn't mean that every country is under that experience. Right. Like that's not the

(5:12:42) case. Mark, do you think that the Jews in Germany would have done better with or without guns?

(5:12:48) I don't know. You don't know. You don't think that if the Jews in Germany had guns like the

(5:12:53) pockets of resistance, Jewish resistance that fought Germans literally in the forest around Germany and literally

(5:13:00) fought back with firearms. Do you think that the Jews would in Germany would have done better with or without?

(5:13:06) Yeah, but we don't like have [ __ ] Nazis and fascists like like you know these people in our country. We we tell

(5:13:12) them to shut the [ __ ] up, sit down and you are not getting um any kind of influence over our country.

(5:13:19) All the Jews should have done is shake their finger, right? Well, this isn't Germany. You're trying to compare apples and oranges. And I

(5:13:25) don't know, maybe maybe they would have if they had guns, they would have just all been shot instantly. And wouldn't

(5:13:31) that wouldn't that have fueled into the Germans doing worse to them? Like, I

(5:13:38) don't know. There's no counterfactual. You're basically going, "Oh, it would have been fair." No, there are counterfactuals. No Jewish

(5:13:43) resistance. We saw Jewish resistance. We saw Jewish resistance. Do you think they use foul language or guns, Mark?

(5:13:50) Well, probably guns. Yeah, probably guns. This one. We'll go to the next one. Yeah. So, give every [ __ ] [ __ ] like

(5:13:55) you a gun and see how that turns out. I have tons, Mark. Who have I shot with? Who have I shot with them?

(5:14:01) Scabby. Oh, yeah. So, people with guns never shoot anybody, you [ __ ] idiot. Did I say that or did I say me?

(5:14:08) Let's go to Scabby says, "James, if you don't read my comments, I'm going to quit donating to your channel. You used

(5:14:14) to read everything. What happened to you? Come on, my guy. I've read most of yours. Most of them are just insulting

(5:14:21) Mark's appearance. So, basically, this uh I didn't think this one says Dalomar

(5:14:28) says, "Mark is the kind of guy that would call the police over jokes on Facebook. Do you plan on enforcing

(5:14:35) speech codes and speech laws, aka hate speech, Mark?"

(5:14:42) Uh, yeah. Yeah. So, there's some speech absolutely that is designed to instill a hatred in the population of certain

(5:14:48) demographics. And that's why Andrew won't say the n-word. He's very aware that these words exist and that, hey,

(5:14:53) he's a piece of [ __ ] if he uses them. And he did use one. He's a piece of I'm not going to use it because he's on YouTube. If you ask me in a bubble to

(5:15:00) say the n word, I'd say it. I don't give a [ __ ] Really? Yeah. I don't care. I don't think, by

(5:15:05) the way, I don't even think that that offends black people as much as you seem to think it does. Really?

(5:15:10) Yeah. Yeah, if you a black person black person said why won't you say it then if it's

(5:15:15) because I'm not going to nuke my friend's channel because because you are I'm not going to nuke my friend's channel.

(5:15:22) Do you want you won't say it because you know it is a horrible word. Cuz I know it'll nuke my friend's channel. I don't give a [ __ ] about the

(5:15:27) word. That's the That's the only [ __ ] about the word. It's never bothered me. It's never bothered you say it to

(5:15:33) black people. You don't give a depending on context perhaps. What do you mean by context? Like if it was really [ __ ] funny.

(5:15:39) Sure. Oh, just funny for you. No, just like funny in general. Like how

(5:15:44) black comedians say it cuz it's funny. Wow. So racist then? Yeah.

(5:15:50) That's not racism. That's not How's that racism? Saying the N word is not racist.

(5:15:55) Yeah. In all context, it's not racist. I'm sorry. Wow. Wow. I know you mean.

(5:16:02) Hang on. Whoever told you that word and said it to you, are they a racist?

(5:16:10) Uh yeah, this one. I'm trying to remember where I heard the

(5:16:16) word first. I think I heard. So if somebody says if you say what is this word and they say oh that that says

(5:16:23) this and it's it's the hard R. They're a racist, Mark. You're a [ __ ] genius.

(5:16:28) No, no, no. The first time I heard it was from an uncle when I was young, I think. I mean, you're talking about a

(5:16:34) word that's existed and been used in an offensive way for a very long time. Next

(5:16:40) one. Wow. This is racist piece of crap. Racist piece of crap. Leon Gray says as an Australian the a

(5:16:47) and they actually it's in Australian currencies. They're not just saying it. They say as an Australian the oh abos

(5:16:55) have a a terrible drug problem in the communities and they sometimes and they

(5:17:01) say uh uh sometimes I think that because

(5:17:06) they're black they get away with things uh because people don't want to appear

(5:17:11) racist if they call them out on something. So they said you're probably a labor voter Mark.

(5:17:20) Um, actually I voted independent in in my last election. Fun fact, we can vote independent and get independents in.

(5:17:28) This one coming in from average redhead says, "Was it good to force the Australian population to take

(5:17:34) Astrazenica, which was later recalled due to its side effects?"

(5:17:40) Astroenica. Uh, yeah. Good for human wellbeing. Yes. But I don't think it was recalled from here. I don't think that

(5:17:47) was that was here. I think that that was in America. Mark, should we ever buy a one in in

(5:17:54) Australia? Should we ever force people to do what's good for them? Well, you're not forced. You have a

(5:17:59) choice. Consequences to that choice. Well, I'm answering your question the way I feel fit. Um, if you have a choice or that

(5:18:07) like if you have a choice to be late to your job, you don't say how you're forced to be on your job. Is it ever correct to force people?

(5:18:13) The consequences of that may be you you're like, you're fired from your job. Don't talk about

(5:18:18) Is it ever okay to force people to do things that they don't want to do? Is it ever okay?

(5:18:23) Yeah. Um yeah, if they're harming somebody else, sure. Like I said, if you're attacking somebody, which How is owning a gun harming somebody

(5:18:29) else? Um because of the social fallout caused by the amount of guns in society that cause incredible amounts of death and

(5:18:37) and destruction throughout society. That doesn't demonstrate how an individual owning a gun actually harms

(5:18:43) anybody else. Yeah. I'll just point again to we don't have Kevlar backpacks.

(5:18:49) Individuals owning guns means you have to have Kevlar backpacks. Oh, so if you don't harm anybody while

(5:18:55) speeding, does that mean you get to speed? Well, you see the interesting thing here, Mark. No, answer my question. If I can drive

(5:19:03) full full tilt, you know, twice the the the amount of the speed limit and I never actually crash, should everybody

(5:19:10) be allowed to drive? The thing is is you can never know what's behind the corner. If you have a gun in your house and it's unloaded,

(5:19:16) it's never going to hurt anybody. Oh, unless it's stolen. Even Okay, wait a second. So then if

(5:19:23) it's stolen, they break the speed limit, then nobody should have cars.

(5:19:28) No, we we have restrictions on who gets to drive license. Exactly. We have restrictions.

(5:19:34) And you can't say a crime perpetrated against me means gun bad.

(5:19:41) What? Yeah, you heard what I said. Somebody steals my guns. That doesn't mean I did a bad thing. They're doing

(5:19:47) bad things. Just like if they stole my car. I can't tell what's behind every corner. That's why speeding laws are there. I

(5:19:53) can always tell what I'm shooting at. And I can always tell where my guns are. And individually and individually, Mark,

(5:19:59) how does me owning a gun hurt [ __ ] anybody anywhere ever? So what we make

(5:20:04) make sure is that people have their guns locked up and have a certain minimum safety standard so this kind of crap

(5:20:10) doesn't happen isn't stolen or taken away to be used against some freaking fouryear-old or

(5:20:17) something which is happening way too often in your country and the the gun rights people Oh really?

(5:20:23) Yeah. What's happening is in minority communities they use handguns and they kill little kids most of the time. But

(5:20:28) with rifles again, you're more likely to die with your hands and feet. Hands and feet.

(5:20:33) Rifles. Rifles. This one. I didn't say rifles. I said Yeah. So, okay. So, fine. Eliminate uh

(5:20:40) handguns. I get to keep AK-47 though, right, Mark? Wow. Wow.

(5:20:46) Right. Right. This one coming. Not in Australia. Not in Australia.

(5:20:51) Not in Australia. No. You don't trust your people there with guns because the guns are going to get up and hurt people.

(5:20:58) You're insane. You are literally insane. Yeah, whatever. That's not an argument, Mark. It's not an argument. You're insane. No, the guns don't hurt

(5:21:04) people. The people with I hate to do this. OP G O OGPI O GPI

(5:21:11) says Mark is toxic masculinity's mascot. I don't understand. Um I thought they

(5:21:18) would have called you a soy boy, Mark. So, I don't understand this insult. Uh,

(5:21:23) but Chad, no, not that you are a soy boy. Chad McDonald's is from Mark.

(5:21:29) Well, I I think I think the um person calling people pansy and all of this kind of stuff, that's that's really the

(5:21:34) toxic masculinity. I think that just simply being confident in your beliefs is not toxic masculinity.

(5:21:40) Chad McDonald says, "For Mark, do you think it goes in your favor when you get really emotional

(5:21:46) and look like a giant baby having a tantrum?" No, I mean, yeah. And and you know,

(5:21:53) Wilson's getting emotional and calling me stuff as well. Yeah, I'm passionate about what I believe, but so is

(5:21:58) everybody. And Wilson, you know, it's kind of it's it's it's funny that you'll hold me to a standard you won't hold

(5:22:04) your own guys to. So that that's hilarious. But, you know, I I the funny

(5:22:09) thing is my debates are usually very peaceful, very interesting. You know, I

(5:22:14) talk back and forth. Every single debate by this [ __ ] is a dumpster fire. He doesn't know any way else to behave. He

(5:22:21) is a child. He has the mentality of a child. Tantrums scream and just

(5:22:27) almost no debate. Almost every debate I have is cordial. What do you mean? I think I've seen your

(5:22:33) Why are you Why are you lying again? Why are you lying again, bro? You interrupt people every debate.

(5:22:38) Okay. I think a lot of these are just trying to

(5:22:43) they're like trying to needle you, Mark. the And I hope you forgive me for like giggling at some of them because it's

(5:22:49) just like they're trying to like you know like some of these I think are like siblings trying to like you know like

(5:22:54) needle each other to get a rise out of them. But you're you're handling it well. I just I wish if I were you I'd

(5:23:00) just be like I'm not even going to respond to that. It's so stupid. But that's okay. Dan Vicious says very noble

(5:23:06) of Mark not wanting to trans all the kids. Is that social responsibility? He

(5:23:13) should also check out the Let's see.

(5:23:18) Very noble of Mark not wanting to trans all the kids. So Mark, you only want to trans some.

(5:23:24) Uh look, it's less than 1% of the population. It's a tiny amount. They're just blowing it out of proportion because well, they're they're religious

(5:23:30) fundamentalists who can't stand this kind of stuff. So you know what? We we have doctors that tell us

(5:23:37) all about it, but they sort of know better because uh I don't know. But um yeah, no, I I I don't know what that's

(5:23:44) about. Look, um I'm okay. I'm I'm a little frustrated, but yeah, that's their that's their tactic. It is to make

(5:23:49) people frustrated and be absolutely threatenous pieces of [ __ ] in order to get a reaction out of them. If that's

(5:23:54) the way you debate, fine. But, you know, if you're a Christian, this is the guy representing you. Congratulations.

(5:23:59) You don't even you don't even have a standard for why being a Christian is wrong, except you just don't prefer it.

(5:24:06) Who cares? Like, who cares? All all all you've done this entire debate is freak

(5:24:11) out and it's been easy to make you do it. Mark, I've barely even pushed and you just freak the [ __ ] out. You freaked out about the guns. You

(5:24:18) freaked the hell out. You're so like calm down. My democracy

(5:24:23) is going fine. Seriously, I don't care about democracy. I'm just pointing out that um you know for a guy

(5:24:31) for a guy who thinks that human beings are inherently moral, you sure seem to want to restrict them from basically

(5:24:36) every every activity in which they could be dangerous. I didn't say inherently moral.

(5:24:42) From Mike Mark, that was in your opening. Literally in your opening, it's part of the manifesto which you draw. It

(5:24:49) says that human beings are inherently moral and that is why we base everything on rationality. It's inherent. inherent.

(5:24:57) Well, we have inherently empathy and reciprocity. I mean, I don't expect you to understand that morality multiple

(5:25:03) syllable words, but except me. Well, that that forms the foundation of morality. Yeah. So, inherently have the

(5:25:08) tools except me. I don't have that. I'm just an exception to the humanity. Well, I'm kind of Well, I don't know. I suspect you have no empathy for people

(5:25:14) because you don't seem to give a [ __ ] But I must be an exception to humanity, Mark. No, no, that's that's called a psychopath.

(5:25:21) So, so then it's not inherent. So, morality is not inherent to humans then? Well, no. A psychopath is somebody who

(5:25:27) has no firing of the mirror. Okay, so forgive me for doing that. I

(5:25:32) just have to There are so many questions. People are very engaged with this debate. Chad Dan Chad McDonald

(5:25:39) says, "For Mark, do you think it goes in your favor when you get really We" We got that. Dan Vicious says, "Very." We

(5:25:45) got that. Mike 3 says, "I'm not an authoritarian, quote unquote. Can you mute my opponent and forcibly prevent

(5:25:53) them from speaking?" I think they're saying that like Mark, you know,

(5:26:01) Yeah. No, I get what he's saying, but if you're not willing to give the other person an opportunity to speak, I don't see why you should be allowed to speak

(5:26:07) by pure dickishness. Basically, usually a debate, you have a back and forth. You basically let the other side speak. But

(5:26:14) some of the That's it. Right. I No, I like that's why I rolled my eyes

(5:26:20) at the the question cuz it's like well yeah like but if Mark is like feeling like he's not getting to say his say

(5:26:26) correct then obviously he's going to tell someone to mute someone so that he can actually be heard because that's why he was invited.

(5:26:32) Yeah. So if you're doing nothing wrong then fine. I'm not going to insist that we restrict you. If you're doing

(5:26:37) something horribly wrong like Andrew has been all debate then yeah I'm going to insist that some restrictions be taken

(5:26:43) so you let other people have a chance. Like what the hell are you talking about? But what do you do about this, Mark? What do you do if you ask a person

(5:26:50) a question and then they answer the question you didn't ask and so you cut in to say, "No, that's not what I

(5:26:56) asked." And then they freak out and say, "I'm answering the question that you didn't [ __ ] ask." What would you do,

(5:27:02) Mark? That is not something that had been happening. Yeah, that's the whole debate. Mark, what would I do? I would probably let

(5:27:07) them finish and then point out, "Hey, you didn't answer the question. This was the question." So, you just waste time the whole

(5:27:12) debate. Let them filibuster. Okay. Mark Otis Driftwood says, "My AI said this."

(5:27:19) F you bald F Mark. Okay, Dan. Nice argument.

(5:27:26) Very enlightened super chat there. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Dan Vicious's come out. Come on, man.

(5:27:32) Don't skip me. He He was like waiting for his to be read and just dying for it. Rachel Wilson says Mark is

(5:27:39) dreadfully wrong again. Over two million people are projected to legally

(5:27:45) immigrate to the US this year, which is only a slight decline from two and a

(5:27:50) half million in 2022. Like you said, don't talk about it if you don't know.

(5:27:59) Okay. Well, how many people are that going to go into detention camps? like 3,000 a day are they they're trying to

(5:28:04) get which would be which even if we granted it would be basically a statistical

(5:28:09) nothing in comparison to how many are coming in right it would be a statistical nothing

(5:28:17) right Mark what 3,000 a day even if it was 3,000 a day. Yeah.

(5:28:22) But I don't think it's for um the people that are legally coming into the country.

(5:28:27) Oh right. So it's the people aren't supposed to be here. They're getting sent literally to holding to holding

(5:28:34) areas so that they can be shipped out. Oh, what a bunch of ruthless bastards. Why would people Why would people

(5:28:39) legally entering your country through immigration not supposed to be there?

(5:28:44) Explain that for me. They overstay their visas, dumbass. They overstay their visas, dumbass.

(5:28:50) Oh, yeah. Like they cancel their visas on one day and then inter them in the next. Yeah, that's great.

(5:28:55) No, they overstay their visas, dummy. No, they're being arrested at courouses.

(5:29:01) When they go there, they're dismissing the cases and then they're arresting them. No, that's not what's happening at all.

(5:29:08) Most people who are getting who are here illegally are overstaying visas. They overstay them, then they get collected

(5:29:15) and they get sent back. We also have a massive amount of immigrants who come up from south of the border. And those

(5:29:20) [ __ ] people, they're not supposed to be here. They are on no visa. They also get rounded up. They get sent to a minor

(5:29:26) holding center for a few days and then bust back to their country. What do you want them to have? Fivestar rits. You

(5:29:31) want them to have the fivestar rits? Oh yeah. And what about the American citizens that have been sent back as well?

(5:29:36) Yeah. All All what? Six of them. Oh yeah. They don't matter. American citizens. Well, I mean oops. In an admin in an

(5:29:43) administrative manner, stuff like that's going to happen occasionally. Yeah. And so let's send them to a prison farm in El Salvador. Yeah.

(5:29:50) I'm sorry. We should never enforce our borders because sometimes we might get it wrong. Genius argument, Mark.

(5:29:56) This one from Oh, yeah. No, you don't care about, you know, a a literal consecration. Yeah. You don't care about

(5:30:01) millions of people. It's not happening to Christians. You don't give a [ __ ] What do you It's mostly happening to

(5:30:06) Christians. What do you mean? Do you think most of the people who come up from [ __ ] Mexico are atheist, dummy? Or are they Catholic?

(5:30:13) Oh, are you getting all angry? What are you angry? Answer the question, Mark. Um, I think they're probably mostly

(5:30:19) Catholic. Yeah. Then what are you talking about? You only care if they're Christians. Oh, so you don't care if they got a different skin color. They can be Christians just

(5:30:25) as long as they they're not, you know, what does their skin color have to do with it? I don't care if you send white people who aren't supposed to be here

(5:30:31) and overstay their H-1B back to their country. I don't give a [ __ ] To El Salvador to a concentration camp.

(5:30:36) They're not going to concentration camps in El Salvador, dummy. What are you talking about? This We must go to the next one. Uh

(5:30:44) folks, uh mods in the chat, please be mindful uh unless it violates YouTube to

(5:30:51) please don't uh bring the hammer down on anybody in the chat. If it does violate

(5:30:57) YouTube to then give them a warning. Uh I would say let's folks in chat if you

(5:31:04) could refrain from using the word [ __ ] because I don't like this is a brand new word for me. So if if Mark says it is

(5:31:12) Can't believe you just said the that most racist word in the world. Mark, why aren't you coming down on James for

(5:31:17) saying that out loud? If Mark says it's a slant or if it's a slur, then

(5:31:23) is if Mark says it's a slur in Australia, then my guess is YouTube will treat it. Did James just do a racism

(5:31:29) in our context, too. So, yes. Uh, yes. So, you're So, James racist term,

(5:31:34) but James doesn't want to use the term. That's the thing. He doesn't want to use it. You do.

(5:31:40) He's trolling you, Mark. He's just trying to Yeah, I know. I know. So, this one from um the Kitsune said

(5:31:48) study that stated that the shutdowns cause more spread than what they stopped

(5:31:55) co-signed by the WHO, mind you. Okay, let's have a look for it. Um I'm

(5:32:01) not aware of this study. I'm not a doctor or anything. I don't I don't think that's the case. I really don't.

(5:32:07) Let's give a chance to look it up. What I'll do is I I think that even if it was we

(5:32:14) basically did what reasonable people would do to try and alleviate the problem under that circumstance. Um you

(5:32:22) know, find me the study that says, "Hey, if we didn't vaccinate the way we did, there would have been better." Find me that study because this is ridiculous.

(5:32:31) We I do want to remind folks first, if you haven't yet, hit that like button. We're at 646. If we get to 700, Mark

(5:32:40) will be sending bottled bath water from his most recent bath to anybody who

(5:32:46) wants it. You just have to let us know your address. Hate to disappoint you. I'm a shower

(5:32:51) guy. I hate to dis Yeah, look. I can do shower water. I can do shower water. Go on. They thought that you were a fan of Only

(5:32:58) Fans, but you are a creator on Only Fans. They didn't know that. No, only Feet. Only Feet. That's That's

(5:33:05) what I'm into. Yeah, sure. This one from Dalomar says, "Mark, Australia is still under the British monarchy. What are you

(5:33:13) talking about?" Yeah. So, it's a constitutional monarchy just like you have a constitutional

(5:33:19) republic. Um the the monarch doesn't even have any power at all. They basically sign laws. They're they're a

(5:33:25) figurehead. Um they don't have any real power. They're more used for greeting

(5:33:30) outside. like the governor greets outsiders and they're more a symbolic thing just like you know the the uh ar

(5:33:37) you know the royals in England they do have a bit of power but they have none over here whatsoever.

(5:33:43) Okay, we're going to get through this. There's

(5:33:49) Zachary Galp says, "Wait, Mark. If uh JW

(5:33:55) S had guns, they would have been worse off than if they didn't. You mean 6

(5:34:01) million of them un alive? It could have been worse.

(5:34:08) Well, I don't know. There's no counterfactual. And it seems like that Yeah, you could say, "Hey, yeah, yeah,

(5:34:13) they would have fought back." Sure. But um you know, the the the the

(5:34:20) lined up because if they did fight and and don't get me wrong, I don't know. I honestly don't know. Maybe they would

(5:34:27) have, but Germany in World War II and Australia are completely different places. Like this is stupid to sort of

(5:34:34) go, okay, well, um, you know, Australia is not taking one segment of their population and turning the, you know,

(5:34:40) everybody on it. That is not what's happening over there. Um, it's not the same situation and trying to do so is

(5:34:46) just ridiculous. Mark, if you were Jewish and in Germany at that time, would you have preferred

(5:34:52) to have had a gun? I would leave. Yeah. But if you couldn't leave, would you have preferred to have?

(5:34:57) Yeah. So, if a country is putting in a sort of, you know, fascist right-wing extremist nationalist government, I

(5:35:05) would leave instantly. I wouldn't. Yeah. But if you couldn't leave, though, would you prefer that you have a gun?

(5:35:11) Because they don't let you leave like they didn't then. Would you would prefer that you have had a gun?

(5:35:17) Um, I don't know. I'm not sure. I don't think so. Is Is Trump a fascist?

(5:35:25) Um, I don't know. I I don't think so. I mean, I think he's got um there's certain elements of him that are

(5:35:31) totalitarian, authoritarian. So, shouldn't I have guns to protect myself? Has a very fascist has a very specific

(5:35:38) meaning. Okay. With ultraist usually compared with extreme right sort of

(5:35:43) religious beliefs. Um, it is sort of um um authoritarian, but there's a difference between authoritarian and a

(5:35:50) fascist. But if Trump is a totalitarian, shouldn't the people here have guns to protect themselves from him?

(5:35:56) I don't think that's necessarily a good idea. Oh,

(5:36:01) well, this one coming in from Mason Miller says, "Secular humanist. It

(5:36:09) is the epitome of evil to demand that the children of those who have them who

(5:36:14) have them are forced through taxation to take care of the atheists who refuse to

(5:36:20) have children. Couldn't send chats to you on Rumble, Andrew.

(5:36:26) Yeah. So, so this is sort of a lack of social responsibility. Okay. Well, that may work in your thing. We take care of

(5:36:32) one another. We believe in sort of um or a lot of people do and you might differ sure but you know Australia has this

(5:36:38) idea of hey we're all mates you're Australian I'm Australian that other person's Australian we should take care

(5:36:44) of each other we have a really good health care system we have a really good um um you know system of government we

(5:36:51) we you know it's not like we're just suffering over here well I mean that's fantastic that the

(5:36:56) religious get to carry the burden of the unreligious who refuse to have children awesome

(5:37:03) I I don't know what your you know that like non-religious people still do have children

(5:37:09) at a way lesser rate, Mark. So what? Like what? What?

(5:37:16) Oh, so you see it's a burden now of carrying people. Is that it? Well, if it is the case.

(5:37:21) So do you think you should force us to have children then? Do you think you should do that? No.

(5:37:28) Then what the [ __ ] is your problem? Do you think that I should force people to take care of you when you're old, though?

(5:37:33) I think that you should contribute to society like everybody else. So, here's the thing. I Here's the difference between us. I would not force

(5:37:39) you to have children. I just would not also force anybody to care for you when you're [ __ ] old. That's the distinction between us. Mark, you're a

(5:37:45) totalitarian lunatic and I'm not. Yeah. You're just a racist piece of

(5:37:50) crap. That's There's nothing racist about anything I've said. Take care of me. It's just, you know, like a hospital.

(5:37:58) You're you basically are saying, "Hey, so a hospital can deny you care." Uh they you know, if you're violent and

(5:38:05) stuff, they do. Yeah. But if you're not violent, can they deny you care? Well, I don't think that's ethical for

(5:38:10) the hospital. Yeah. Right. So, what ends up happening is that you're going to get subsidized by the people who are having children.

(5:38:15) Take care of your [ __ ] ass at the expense of those children, the taxpayer. That's what's going to happen.

(5:38:20) Oh, it it's funny because like when there's something bad happens, it's like, "Oh, these aren't Christians. These are different Christians. Those

(5:38:25) not are with us. They're not with us." every time you need it to work in your favor, you're like, "Oh, we're all Christians. We're all taking care. We're

(5:38:30) all doing this. We're all doing that." You have the most flip-flop idea of who is a Christian based upon your needs at

(5:38:36) the time. That is absolutely incredible. Like, it's it's absolutely incredible. Well, G Mark, it's amazing to me that at

(5:38:42) the same time you group every single atrocity that's ever happened to all Christians, but then when I use that to my advantage to point out all the good

(5:38:48) things Christians do, you say, "No, they need to be compartmentalized." It's actually your hypocrisy, Mark, not mine.

(5:38:53) I acknowledge that Christians do good things. So you're just lying. No, you just won't acknowledge that

(5:38:58) they're compartmentalized in different liar. I acknowledge that, sir. You are a What does that have to do with the argument that I just made?

(5:39:05) What does it have to do with the argument I just made, Baldi? You are a lying piece of [ __ ] with

(5:39:10) What does that have to do with the argument I just made? You absolute muted looking gerbal bogan.

(5:39:16) What are you doing? You absolute jow flapping uncle fester looking chromo.

(5:39:22) Answer my [ __ ] question. What does it have to do with the thing I just asked you? Despondent piece of a hippo's ass

(5:39:30) flapping on your [ __ ] oily. You almost got the adjectives right. Why don't you go and [ __ ] your cooker,

(5:39:36) you [ __ ] Oh, you cheek fluffy [ __ ] van [ __ ]

(5:39:41) lunatic. Answer my [ __ ] question. I hate to do this you guys. We have to

(5:39:47) go. This reminds me of in the movie Hook when Peter Pan and Rufio get in the the

(5:39:56) argument over dinner and then he calls him a prayerium. We're going to go to the next question. Damar says, "If you

(5:40:04) were going to put speech codes in under hate speech, quote unquote, can we not

(5:40:09) then put in codes to prevent you from saying quote unquote hateful things about Christians?" Mark

(5:40:18) Uh, I'm not sure what hateful things about Christians. I've pointed out Christians have done atrocities, but I'm

(5:40:23) not saying that all Christians are X or Y or using some kind of slur for them.

(5:40:28) If you could point out what slur I've used for Christians, then please do so. Anita Borchon says, "Hey, black guy

(5:40:37) here. I don't care if Andrew says it. After all, he's one of the brothers,

(5:40:42) isn't he, Mark? Tell me why I'm wrong. Yeah. Like, you know, this is the racist

(5:40:48) stuff. This this like I want to talk to the Christians out there. This is the guy representing you.

(5:40:55) Racist, you know, like this is the person who is stepping into to represent Christianity. It's not a wonder why

(5:41:01) people are leaving churches. It's not a wonder. The super chatter put that not

(5:41:06) Yeah. Yeah. And this is this is the Christians in his channel. This is good Christian morals. be racist and say

(5:41:12) horrible things and do all this horrible stuff. Yeah. No, it's it's good Christian morals here. Fantastic.

(5:41:17) But wait, but to be fair, we don't we really actually don't like if it really was a black person. I know. I know. I don't think all

(5:41:23) Christians are like Andrew. That's why Christians don't like him as well because they say he doesn't represent how we behave in public. But I'm just

(5:41:29) saying this is the guy representing you. It's it's insane. But the the super chatter, I don't know

(5:41:37) that they're not actually black. Because if they're black, then it we'd

(5:41:43) be kind of dismissive when we don't know if they are. Yeah. Well, we we consider if we don't

(5:41:48) know, we just, you know, would assume don't use that because we don't know how to judge it. A lot of people who are

(5:41:54) racist go and pretend they are um you know, of a different race in order to be incredibly racist on chat. We all know

(5:42:01) that happens. Anyway, Rachel Wilson says, "Mark is wrong again. Australia is currently

(5:42:07) experiencing record levels of violence in schools. Link to data in chat.

(5:42:13) Oh yeah, it's bullying. That's the whole point. Like, yeah, there's there's sort of physical violence. And I think there

(5:42:18) always has been. There definitely has been. I'm not saying it's perfect, but what I'm saying is that when someone gets bullied or something, they they're

(5:42:26) they're upset and there, you know, that's obviously wrong, but they're not getting shot. So, can you please like

(5:42:31) understand like what are you even talking about? like, oh yeah, because there's there's a bit of bit of violence

(5:42:37) in the school as kids do, then we should be able to carry guns and have our children being shot. Yeah, great

(5:42:43) argument. Fantastic. Well done. Well done. What's causing what's causing the record violence in America?

(5:42:48) No, in Australia. What's causing the record violence in schools right now? Um, right-wing influence um with these

(5:42:54) sort of macho man groups sort of influencing um sort of fighting among

(5:43:00) kids and it's really terrible. It sounds like totalitarianism. Don't you want to be able to protect yourself from that?

(5:43:07) Oh, so you're you're you like kids being beaten up. Is that what you're saying? Wouldn't that be the opposite of what

(5:43:12) I'm saying? So, you think we should give guns to children to defend themselves?

(5:43:18) No. I think that if it is the case that right-wing groups have infiltrated your schools to the point where they're influencing them, to the point where

(5:43:24) they're beating everybody up, don't you think that people ought to have a right to defend themselves as that will spiral

(5:43:30) out, right? Yes. I think people have a right to defend themselves. Sure. But just not with guns.

(5:43:36) Well, are people like what what what the hell are you talking about? These these are people getting into fights like fist

(5:43:42) fights, not taking guns into Yeah. If somebody punches me in the face, I'm going to shoot them. Did you know that?

(5:43:47) Okay. So, if you punch someone in the face and then you shoot them and you miss, why shouldn't they take out a gun

(5:43:52) and shoot you? No, no, no. That's not what I said. I said if somebody Why not? Why can't I shoot you after that point? Why not?

(5:43:59) Because you would be the initiator of the violence, dummy. Oh, well that's an escalation of violence, isn't it?

(5:44:04) Yeah, escalating. No, no, no. It's not an escalation of violence. Just escalate the violence in schools. So, it includes shootings.

(5:44:10) That wouldn't be an escalation. If somebody attacks me and I kill them, it's not escalating violence that's

(5:44:15) ending it. Are you serious?

(5:44:21) Yes, I'm [ __ ] serious. In violence that escalation, you shoot them.

(5:44:26) That's not escalation. Somebody attacks you and you shoot them. That's not escalation. That's deescalation.

(5:44:32) What should the child do when another child in school hits them? Well, in that particular case, if you're

(5:44:37) talking, it depends on the age of the child. 16, 17, 18,

(5:44:44) something like that. Or are we talking about like people who we're talking about school max in

(5:44:49) school? Yeah. Yeah. So, if what about if a 17-year-old's attacking an adult in the school,

(5:44:55) like a woman? Uh, okay. Is she allowed to defend

(5:45:00) herself with a gun? No. No. So, if a man full grown mansized

(5:45:06) 17-year-old is beating up a [ __ ] female teacher, she can't do that. This is the stupidity of anger. I can't

(5:45:12) wait to hear how that's basically saying if a 17-year-old student like in some way um physically attacks a a teacher,

(5:45:21) they have a gun. Hey, shut up. They should have a gun. Pull out the gun and

(5:45:28) shoot the child. Yes, that's right. If you are insane. You are [ __ ] insane.

(5:45:37) We'll go to the next question. This one is

(5:45:43) I don't know what he's saying. He's just carrying on like a like a pork chop. I don't know what he say. Mark is wrong again. Oh, no. That's

(5:45:50) a different We read that. Mike 3 says, "Mark is such a delusional manchild that

(5:45:58) he thinks his government cannot become more oppressive or tyrannical than it

(5:46:04) already is." Quote, "Because it's Australia," unquote. Trust me, bro. This

(5:46:09) time it's different. Yeah, I don't trust you and I don't really listen to anything you say. No,

(5:46:15) I'm not delusional. Andrew is the delusional one. He already conceded it during the debate and I don't see why we should listen to him in any way, shape

(5:46:21) or form. Um, Christopher, yeah, I'm not saying it can't happen. I'm just saying, hey, we work towards that not happening. And, you know, I I'm

(5:46:28) not going to worry about it. I'm not going to let it stress me. I'm not going to, oh, oh, but my government does this. No, we change our government to be the

(5:46:35) government that we want. Not like just sit back, relax, and go, "Oh, well, you do whatever and then we'll we'll do

(5:46:40) something afterwards." You have to work at it. And that's why everybody votes. That's the whole point. Everybody

(5:46:46) contributes that thing to stop things like that. Christopher Scott says,

(5:46:52) "Fine, I'll be toxically masculine instead of whining about someone calling me a name and complaining that is quote

(5:46:59) toxic masculinity." What a I don't know. Well, I mean, it's just

(5:47:06) trying to co-op the idea of toxic masculinity. This idea of, you know, extreme masculinity and this this, oh, I

(5:47:11) don't feel nothing and I don't say nothing. It's just it it's pathetic. It's it's really just insecurity about

(5:47:17) who you are just manifesting as extreme manhood. It it it's quite frankly pretty pathetic in my eyes. So yeah, but you

(5:47:24) know, if you want to try and co-opt it, whatever. You know, that's up to you. Gabby says Mark is the type of guy to

(5:47:31) practice painting his nails with the excuse that maybe his daughter will want to spend time with him between her Only

(5:47:38) Fans videos. I know. I've never painted my nails. I think I had a girlfriend paint my nails once, but no, I don't. I, you know, but

(5:47:46) you know, this is the kind of stupidity you get from morons with no actual

(5:47:51) arguments, and instead they have to try and, you know, pick on you because they're morons.

(5:47:58) Electric Ninja says, "You don't need a gun, a gum until you do." We should probably not use the gun word here.

(5:48:04) YouTube is just um they say until you do, Mark. But you kind of have already said like I'm not

(5:48:10) saying it's impossible that the government would become tyrannical and violent. I just think it's highly

(5:48:16) improbable. Jordan Thomas says Mark, would the world

(5:48:22) be better if all humans tomorrow became true atheists or true Christians?

(5:48:29) I don't know what a true Christian is. That sounds like a no true Scotsman fallacy to me to be honest with you. But

(5:48:34) I don't know what that is and I'm in no position to judge. At the same time, there's some horrible atheists out there. Just because you're an atheist

(5:48:40) doesn't mean I agree with you. Um, you know, there's some horrible people that are atheists, and I don't agree with

(5:48:46) them at anything at all. It's just such a it's kind of a nonsensical question because if they became sort of nihilists

(5:48:52) or or some kind of, you know, um um totalitarian atheists, then no, it

(5:48:57) wouldn't be a better world. Um, but you know, what are true Christians? You're going to have to define that because that is the claim of every single

(5:49:04) Christian in the world. They are the true Christians. So I don't know what what that is.

(5:49:10) When you tell Andrew like, "Wow, you're such a great Christian."

(5:49:15) Like, is that indicative of what you think a true Christian is? No. It's sarcasm. I don't think he's a

(5:49:22) good Christian or like what most Christians would consider to be a good Christian. I think that they would say,

(5:49:28) "Hey, he's belligerent. He's not kind. He's not gentle. He's not Christlike." And that's what I hear a lot. But at the

(5:49:33) same time, he says that is true Christianity. So, you know, who am I to judge? I I don't know what true

(5:49:39) Christianity is because I don't think any of it is true. So, you judge yourself. What is true Christianity? Is it being Christlike or is it being

(5:49:46) obnoxious? That's up to you. I don't find that. Imagine Mark saying, "I'm not a true Christian." And then going on to say how

(5:49:53) great Christians are and that's why I'm not one of them. while at the same time saying that he should be the arbiter of

(5:50:00) what happens in society while saying how great Christians are, especially for

(5:50:06) society if I were to follow what he perceived as being Christian virtues. It's the ultimate irony of the person

(5:50:12) who's been spuring and freaking out the entire night, muting me, saying he's going to take away all your rights, saying that he wants to do all the

(5:50:18) horrible things he accuses me of. He got so offended by a word. Mark, you got so offended by a word, you haven't been

(5:50:26) able to stop freaking out about it for the last 40 minutes. How do you How does that happen? How do you get that freaked out about a [ __ ]

(5:50:32) word? Yeah. 40 minutes. 40 minutes. No. No. I'm more um angry that that a platform can at least let a

(5:50:39) racist piece of [ __ ] on. It's all about deplatforming, James. I knew it. No, no, you're a racist piece of [ __ ]

(5:50:44) I'm not angry at James or his platform. anger at you because you are a racist, a transphobe, a bigot, a disgusting

(5:50:51) character who lives in the toilet of his own existence. You are horrible. But at the same time, I didn't say I didn't say

(5:50:58) that that all Christians were bad or all Christians are this or all Christians are that. And I acknowledge that

(5:51:04) Christians have done good things, which you haven't acknowledged that atheists have done good things because you're going to have a concept. You're a

(5:51:10) heinous idiot that can't acknowledge anything. Um, but here's the thing. I I

(5:51:15) can say, hey, Christians, you know, uh can be good, but that doesn't mean Christianity is good. Like I said,

(5:51:21) there's theistic humanists and we generally agree on almost everything. So if I assu

(5:51:29) that you thought made a Christian good, would I be good? What? Humility, Christ. Yeah. Whatever those things are that you

(5:51:35) believed a Christian should embody, if I embodied those things, would I be good? Necess I don't think you'd necessarily

(5:51:41) be good. I think that you I think who cares who cares if I don't live up to your ideals of Christianity kind and

(5:51:48) gentle and still not be that good for society. I mean who cares if I live up

(5:51:53) to your ideal killers some serial killers have been

(5:51:58) kind and gentle and really quiet people really humble doesn't mean they're good people and I must add serial killers

(5:52:04) also been Christians so you know there's perfect so then me living up to the ideals of Christianity still wouldn't

(5:52:10) make me good. So who gives a [ __ ] Mark? Right. So who cares? Why would I care what your

(5:52:15) standard for what a real Christian is? I still wouldn't be good if even if I lived up to it. Like I said, if you want to live in a

(5:52:21) world with happy and healthy people, then secular humanism works towards that. Like I don't say that you have to

(5:52:27) want that. It's just Yeah. Just take all your guns, force vaccinations on you, lock your [ __ ] ass down, make sure that your kids can

(5:52:33) be mutilated. Yeah. Great [ __ ] society, Mark. I can't wait to live there. Yeah. persecute people, be bigoted, use

(5:52:40) racist language, vilify people. Oh my god, you used a word. You used a word. I wouldn't take I wouldn't take

(5:52:46) guns from black people, though. You were just racist. Would you take guns from black people? Would you take guns from black people?

(5:52:54) I wouldn't do anything. No. Would you enable the state to take guns from black people? Did they forcefully take the guns

(5:53:00) in Australia? Yes. If you didn't comply, if you didn't comply with turning them in, they arrested your ass. Yes. But it

(5:53:06) was mostly a buyback scheme, right? It doesn't matter. They did indeed force you to take them because if you didn't,

(5:53:11) you got arrested guns. I bet you cuddle up. That's not an argument. You're obsessed. I'm obsessed with arguments at night and

(5:53:18) sniff it. I bet you spend more time with your gun than with your with anybody else. I bet you Oh, were you about to say my wife? Were

(5:53:24) you were about to say my wife, weren't you, Mark? You can't help it, can you, Mark? Can you? You can't help it.

(5:53:30) Well, with anybody. I think you absolutely adore guns. That's true. I absolutely do. But the

(5:53:36) thing is is like that's not an argument. Would you take black people or would you take guns away from black people, Mark?

(5:53:41) Yeah. Okay. Okay, good. We got to go. And white people. But I'm racist person.

(5:53:47) Oh, yeah. Because I treat black and white people the same. I'm a racist. You [ __ ] moral. That's right.

(5:53:52) Okay. I hate to do this, but we have to go to the next one. Techno zero says Mark lied. Um Howard Springs facility

(5:54:00) with mobile homes and chainlink fencing and armed guards was a real quote

(5:54:05) unquote quarantine site. Also coercion is force.

(5:54:17) Um have you actually looked at the pictures of that? So that was for only people entering the

(5:54:24) country who needed to do a mandatory thing. It wasn't like grabbing people in the country and forcing them in there.

(5:54:29) It was people flying into the country from places that had high high rates of infection that we put into quarantine

(5:54:37) temporarily until we could be sure they weren't infected. I mean, I don't like you're you're completely

(5:54:42) mischaracterizing what it is. And they weren't kept in there. They're still not in there. It was simply people coming

(5:54:47) into the country, that's all. Oh, but you know, let's let's just let them go out and affect everybody. Yeah, why not?

(5:54:54) That sounds bright and and incredibly smart. This one coming in from Techno uh that

(5:55:02) Kitsune says, "Mark, nobody wants to go to the US except illegals." And then they say, "Also, Mark, why is your

(5:55:08) debate tactic what aboutism?" You probably don't really my debate tactic. Yeah. No, I

(5:55:15) don't agree. And I think that what aboutism has been done by by Andrew on an incredible rate.

(5:55:21) True Seabball. What about the guns? What about the guns? Yeah. Yeah. Says smokeoky man asking logical

(5:55:28) questions. Q-tip head nar nar nar. Okay.

(5:55:34) Zachary Galp says P1. Mark, your answer to my question shows your lack of

(5:55:39) knowledge of history. Same happened in Germany in the 40s. Could happen literally anywhere.

(5:55:48) Okay. Well, I'm not I'm not worried in the slightest. Damar, the only reason why there'd be an

(5:55:55) authoritarian government is that pricks like Wilson got authoritarians into there and started making people worship

(5:56:01) their religion and do exactly what they want. This is the thing. The thing you're afraid of is the very thing that you're promoting.

(5:56:08) You guys and secular secularists are completely incapable of that. Right, Mark? I didn't say that.

(5:56:14) Well, then what are you talking about, Mark? Did I say secularist? Yeah. You just

(5:56:20) said the only thing you need to worry about is if a bunch of crazy religious people authoritarians take over power.

(5:56:26) Secularists are completely capable of doing that, right, Mark? Yeah. And who's turning the government authoritarian in the US at the moment?

(5:56:33) Uh I don't think the government is authoritar more authoritarian right now in the US. You don't think they're violating the

(5:56:39) Constitution? They're locking people away. They're taking citizens off. No, I think they're finally enforcing the Constitution how it was intended to

(5:56:45) be. Yeah. Wow. Wow. Great argument. Yeah. So,

(5:56:50) great argument. Wow. No. No. Go suck up to your felon in chief, you know, the the PDF file that's

(5:56:56) currently like locking citizens up because he thinks they're the wrong color. Yeah. Enjoy that. Yeah. Except that's not happening. Who

(5:57:02) is he locked up cuz they're the wrong color? Um there was that security guard outside that was detained for 4 days and he was

(5:57:09) a Donald Trump locked him up and a veteran who did nothing. Trump locked him up. No, the buck never stops with him. He

(5:57:15) just created the eye squads, armed them, sent them into places without checking ID properly, sent them away to the wrong

(5:57:21) country even though they had a court order not to go. But that isn't his fault. That's nothing to do with him. Right. It must be some other PDF file

(5:57:28) doing that. Right. Right. Wait. So I get this right. Donald Trump unilaterally decided to lock up people

(5:57:35) cuz they're brown. Uh he is the one that directed them to

(5:57:40) do racial profiling. So his Who's being racially profiled? his department of homeland basically said

(5:57:46) that why they can use physical appearance to judge if somebody is an illegal in Oh geez you can you mean to say that if

(5:57:54) it is the case that the majority of the illegals who are here without H-1Bs are

(5:58:00) Hispanic that we couldn't use our eyeballs to make a determination that that would be the demographic to go

(5:58:05) after that's that's bad Mark yeah that's profiling

(5:58:10) yeah what's wrong with that if you know the race that's most that that that's going to be why wouldn't you use racial

(5:58:15) profiling? You would like to be detained for no reason other than you're a white person. Maybe, you know, you you got messy hair,

(5:58:22) you look a bit scruffy, you're a bit of an idiot. Like, let's lock you up until um you know, not give you any rights.

(5:58:27) Just lock you up and then detain you against all of that. That's not what's going on, Mark.

(5:58:34) Oh, really? Yeah. There's reasonable suspicion that various people are illegal immigrants. It's being stopped under suspicion.

(5:58:40) An ex veteran security guard with citizenship is reasonable suspicion.

(5:58:46) Yes, that would you could have reasonable suspicion for that. Of course. What's the reasonable suspicion?

(5:58:51) Well, in this case, they had reasonable suspicion that he was here illegally and so they detained him under that reasonable suspicion.

(5:58:57) No, that isn't a reason. That's just saying there's reason. What is the reasonable suspicion under that particular case? Tell me what

(5:59:02) it was. I don't know off the top of my head. What was it? What's reasonable suspicion? I don't think there was reasonable. And demonstrate it. demonstrate there

(5:59:08) was no reasonable suspicion. I'll believe you. You want me to demonstrate the absence of something? You think you can't do that? It's not

(5:59:15) raining in my house right now. It's not raining in my house right now. I just demonstrated the absence of something. Do you think you can't prove a negative?

(5:59:21) But by the way, I'm not even asking you to prove a negative. Just your claim. I don't think that there was any reasonable suspicion based on

(5:59:30) uh the fact that he was um a security guard in the facility. He was attempting

(5:59:37) to get home and had no other basis for arresting him other than he was there

(5:59:43) and was demonstrate it. Demonstrate that that's George Ratiz 25. Yeah. And that's not

(5:59:48) how the law works. What do you think articulable suspicion means? Well, that you have some reason to

(5:59:53) detain a person based on the fact that you think that they're commit in the commission of some sort of crime.

(6:00:00) Yes. Like being here illegally. Yes. And so if they suspected that he

(6:00:06) was here illegally, that would be reasonable suspicion. He was committing a crime. Why did they suspect he was here

(6:00:11) illegally? I don't I'm asking you on the details of this case, did they give a reason? No.

(6:00:17) Okay. So I'm just going to make sure. Basically, it was George George Ratiz Res who was 25.

(6:00:24) He identified himself as a US citizen. They broke his window, dragged him out of his car, and arrested him.

(6:00:30) Okay, let's see if there was no reasonable suspicion or if you're lying again. We'll go to the next question.

(6:00:36) Okay. Oh. Oh, jeez. All right. Okay. Let's just make sure that we got this

(6:00:41) right. So, I just want to make sure that your official position is that they gave

(6:00:46) no reason at all for this. Right, Mark? What was the reason? No, no. I just want to make sure I got

(6:00:51) your position first. Okay. Well, I mean, they gave no they gave no reasonable

(6:00:57) What is suspicion? What is the suspicion? What is Oh, can you just answer the question? Out, dude. Just just answer the

(6:01:02) question. What's the position then? If you're so correct, you first I just want to make sure that I got you on record saying that they didn't have one.

(6:01:08) They did not have a reason. Correct. Okay. Just want to make sure.

(6:01:13) Okay. Okay. Except that they claimed that they did. They claimed that they had they

(6:01:18) they claimed that they had viable reasonable uh uh reasons to believe that

(6:01:24) he was here illegally based on the connections that he had with illegals who were in his family. And so what they

(6:01:30) did was they did a routine a routine detention. They could not verify his identification and then made a mistake

(6:01:37) which happens all the time including in your own prison system, Mark. Oh wow. No, the government couldn't have

(6:01:43) made that up. What a load of [ __ ] He's Bro, you just said they had none.

(6:01:48) Hang on, hang on. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. He was a security guard working there. What is wrong with

(6:01:55) you? So what? And then he was detained for 3 days without a lawyer, without Oh, he was a fruit picker working

(6:02:01) somewhere. So what? What does that have to do with where he was working? Fruit picker. He was Yeah, but if he was, why would that have to do with anything? What does that have

(6:02:07) to do with anything? He was a security guard somewhere. You can't work here. authoritarian. We just think you can

(6:02:13) grab a citizen off the street with no real articulable suspicion of why you

(6:02:18) suspending too much time on this one. This one

(6:02:24) coming in from Zachary Galp. I got that one.

(6:02:30) He says, "It didn't just happen to the uh JWS.

(6:02:36) The first thing the Turks did was take away the guns from the Armenians. And then a similar thing happened there,

(6:02:43) Mark.

(6:02:48) Yeah, look, I got no reason why I think that is the case. This has been shouted out by right-wing people for ages now,

(6:02:54) ever since we did it, and everything's going fine. So, just look after yourself. If you want to have mass

(6:03:00) shootings and stuff, it's up to you. Leave us to do our thing. Um, I I don't see what the problem is. Why you have

(6:03:06) to, you know, try and control everybody's country. It's it's crazy. Damar said 50 million illegal aliens in

(6:03:13) the US understand the difference between a legal immigrant and an illegal alien.

(6:03:19) Uh, sorry, between a legal immigrant and an illegal alien. We need to be

(6:03:27) deporting 30,000 a day, 365 days a year to make a real dent. And we are just ramping up.

(6:03:34) I think they're saying, "How do you like them apples, Mark?" Yeah. Well, I mean, you're also putting

(6:03:40) um, you know, an insane amount more money. And, hey, that's your choice. That's your country. Don't let me, you

(6:03:46) know, that's up to you what you do with your immigration policy. That that's whatever. It's just, you know,

(6:03:52) okay, like your economy is going downhill because there's no fruit pickers and, you know, it's it's just a

(6:03:59) disaster. I mean, what what can I say? This one from um Shaw XD says, "Question

(6:04:05) for Mark. Where does um your head end in your body begin? Having a hard time

(6:04:11) making it out." Okay. Yeah, I would expect some of Andrew's audience not to understand anatomy

(6:04:17) because they don't understand well anything really. But yeah, it's called a neck. See that?

(6:04:22) Kyle says, "As a person who is half black, Andrew has the pass. You don't

(6:04:28) Mark. Um, yeah. What a troll. Anita says, "Hi, I'm actually black."

(6:04:40) So, I will prove it on my camera. So, again,

(6:04:45) Mark, tell me why I'm wrong. Mark, tell me. Yeah, I'm just going to ignore that

(6:04:51) person. Seriously. Wait, but they might be black. Is this a Toby?

(6:04:56) Yeah, I there's no way to tell because they're just, you know, that's fine. I whatever. But, you know, I mean, if if

(6:05:03) Andrew is allowed to go up and say that to you, well, I mean, they

(6:05:08) some people don't like it. Trev says this um can we say cuck? Is

(6:05:13) that still against is that still bad? I have no idea, mate. um they say is doesn't represent the rest of us here in

(6:05:22) Australia whatsoever. Okay, we know you're not Yeah, that's why I said that's that's

(6:05:28) why I said overwhelming majority and not absolutely everybody. You know that words words actually have meanings.

(6:05:34) Maybe maybe learn a few of them.

(6:05:40) Oh my god, he's still talking. It's It's sad. I'm sorry. It's late, so I'm just like

(6:05:46) laughing uncontrollably. Except if Mark puts a light bulb in his mouth, would it light up?

(6:05:54) You don't look like Uncle Fester. You know what? I have taken a fair amount of voltage in my life, so maybe

(6:06:00) that's true. Who knows? You don't look like Uncle Fester. It's only funny because I like recognized it

(6:06:06) was referring to Uncle Fester. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I got you. I got you. Dan Vicious says, "Without an

(6:06:11) objective I it would be too, if you actually looked like the person, it'd be too mean for me to say it and I wouldn't

(6:06:16) want to say it." So, without an objective moral foundation, Mark leads us to mob rule and the drug company

(6:06:23) government propaganda that has been harming people for years.

(6:06:29) Yeah. Um weird thing is is that we have um you know this is sort of stupid like

(6:06:34) just because um I um you know will will sort of support government on certain

(6:06:40) things doesn't mean I support everything. And I think there's way too much corporate influence on government. So you're just basically strawmanning

(6:06:46) ascribing beliefs to me that I don't have. But interestingly enough because of the Australian system we pay way less

(6:06:51) than you. I think you guys get ripped off. It's absolutely criminal what those pharmaceutical companies are charging

(6:06:58) and and doing um out there. So, I think, you know, it's pretty horrible. Pretty

(6:07:03) horrible. And those top scientists who work for those uh pharmaceutical companies and

(6:07:08) the CEOs, you think they're Christians or secularists? I don't know. I mean, probably most um

(6:07:15) Well, if you could let me finish, probably mostly secularists, but there's probably some Christians in there, too. Sure. Yeah. Damn secularists ripping us off.

(6:07:22) [ __ ] bastards. Well, it's also the CEOs and stuff. I mean that they don't they don't decide,

(6:07:27) you know, the scientists don't decide the prices on the drugs and set up the health care system, right? Yeah. But so they're just party to the

(6:07:33) people who do who are immoral. Well, they're just doing a job. Oh, yeah. So, that's what the Germans

(6:07:39) said, wasn't it? What the hell? What? What? What is wrong with you?

(6:07:44) They were just following orders, right? Oh, so so we should not have any medicine? Is that what you're saying?

(6:07:49) Medicine? What do you mean? I'm asking about participating in an immoral system that you know is immoral.

(6:07:55) Why would secularists do that? The drug companies. Yeah. Why would secularists involve

(6:08:02) themselves in an immoral structure, sir? Because they're probably not secular

(6:08:08) humanists. Oh. And they still have to work for a living and provide for themselves. That's

(6:08:14) probably why. And they may not know that what they're doing is so bad. And it is a systemic thing that no one person has

(6:08:22) control over and I wish were different. But instead of like what should they do just not produce medicine and drugs?

(6:08:30) Well, they should just not focus on alopathic medicine specifically. Yeah.

(6:08:35) Alopathic medicine. Yeah. Do do you know what alopathic means, dummy?

(6:08:41) Just say that little just say just say no. Oh, do you mind like pseudocience

(6:08:46) stuff like like alopathic is pseudocience? Okay. I don't know. I don't know what it is.

(6:08:52) And I know you should just say that next time. I did. What are you talking about? No, you didn't. You said I was uncalled

(6:08:59) for. I couldn't believe I can't believe that you would say such a thing. Yeah. I think that one of the big problems is is

(6:09:05) that there's a hyperfocus on alopathic medicine only. So alopathic medicine key features of alopathic medicine drug

(6:09:12) based approach relies heavily on pharmaceutical drugs to combat disease symptom management.

(6:09:18) So we shouldn't produce drugs but we shouldn't rely on did I say that

(6:09:24) or did I say we shouldn't focus on dummy where do they come from? Uh well, they

(6:09:30) usually come from uh pharmaceutical uh companies who see a profit drive to

(6:09:35) either treat uh cure or in some way incapacitate a disease or give some sort

(6:09:41) of elongity to a person or uh have some sort of effect on a person that they

(6:09:46) desire. So alopathic medicine which a key feature is using a drug based approach.

(6:09:54) We're not going to produce the drugs through any kind of drug company and we're going to do alipathic medicine.

(6:10:01) Yeah. Do you know what a preventative there's there's preventative approaches and preventative approaches approaches

(6:10:07) are not alopathic are they? Uh no.

(6:10:13) Okay. So then when I say we shouldn't just focus on alopathic medicine which is what secularist drove us to. We

(6:10:19) should focus on things like preventative medicine as well. You don't even disagree, do you, dummy?

(6:10:26) Well, I mean, if you really believe that, then you wouldn't be smoking Cioenics, would you? What? Even if I was completely guilty,

(6:10:32) if everything that I preached was true, it wouldn't make me [ __ ] wrong, would it? Well, I I think there's a problem. Like,

(6:10:38) that doesn't mean that we can do Oh my god, this [ __ ] guy. It should we focus on preventive medicine?

(6:10:44) No, no, no. Not all treated with preventative medicine. You're thinking that everything can be treated with

(6:10:51) preventive medicine. How are you going to treat medicine? Listen to this jerk. He won't

(6:10:57) let anybody talk. How are we going to do How are you going to treat bowative medicine? Why don't you answer the

(6:11:02) question, Andrew? Why don't you answer the question, Andrew? Why don't you answer the question? How are you going

(6:11:08) to treat bowel cancer with preventative medicine? Oh, well, that's that's actually a great question. So, uh there's all sorts of

(6:11:14) things which could lead to bowel cancer, like plastic, for instance. So you're going to eliminate plastic

(6:11:20) from the world? No, you wouldn't eliminate it, but you could definitely assist. Oh, so people will still get cancer, will they?

(6:11:25) No. Well, you could greatly reduce Well, they Oh. Oh, so if you do preventative treatment, no one's going to get cancer. Is that

(6:11:31) No, but you could reduce it, right? Oh, so dummy, we're still going to need drugs, you idiot, aren't we? Did I say Did I Did I say

(6:11:37) absolute moral? Did I say we wouldn't need drugs or did I say we should only focus on alopathic

(6:11:42) medicine? That stop companies from making drugs. Can we just prevent it through wishful thinking? and God believes. Yeah.

(6:11:48) Did anybody ever say that? See how that turns out for you, you [ __ ] idiot. Seriously. So, just to get this right, when I say

(6:11:54) Hang on. When I say Yeah, I think we should move on. He's I think I think we move on. I get a chance to respond.

(6:11:59) He's not a doctor. You've already had my say. Let's move on. Let's move on. 5

(6:12:05) hours going on. How about No, you're moving on. [ __ ] you. I'm not moving on. [ __ ] you. No, you won't listen to me. I

(6:12:11) won't listen to you. That's how it works. You I'm not moving on till I get my point in. No. No, you don't. You don't

(6:12:18) have to speak over No matter what happens over me. No matter what happens, we're going to

(6:12:24) go right back to this point. No matter what happens, we're going to go back to this point. You think that you can prevent

(6:12:29) everything? How are you going to do all disease? Yeah. So, anyway, I didn't Yeah. No, Andrew's got the answer. He's

(6:12:35) going to prevent all disease if you ever shut up. Yeah. So, anyway, so the thing is is nobody ever said that

(6:12:41) you had to get rid of alopathic medicine. Who said that? Just the drugs that are used for

(6:12:47) alipathic medicine. Good one. Did anybody ever say that you have to get rid of drugs? Good one, dummy. Did anybody ever say that? Who's going to produce them?

(6:12:53) Did anybody ever say that nobody should produce drugs? Dummy. Dummy. Who's going to produce them?

(6:12:58) Did anybody ever say people shouldn't produce Why won't you answer the question? Pharmaceutical companies. You're going to do it in your backyard.

(6:13:04) Pharmaceutical companies, of course. And how are they going to charge for those? Uh, probably the same way that they

(6:13:11) charge now. Exactly the [ __ ] same way. You absolutely. Oh, wait a second. What a And then they're going to raise

(6:13:18) prices because there's less demand. What a absolute idiot.

(6:13:23) They're going to raise prices so there's less demand. So we should make people more sick so prices go down, you [ __ ] idiot.

(6:13:29) Not only that, Let me just Let's just point this out. How [ __ ] You do know that people try to present

(6:13:34) prevent disease already, don't you? No. preventative preventative disease uh

(6:13:41) uh any type of preventative disease maintenance actually is not alopathic medicine and no doctors are often

(6:13:47) trained by pharmaceutical companies and not for preventative measures in disease control. So the [ __ ] [ __ ] that says we should

(6:13:54) prevent disease sits there sucking on a cigarette. So what a [ __ ] idiot. Like seriously,

(6:13:59) the guy who says you shouldn't do heroin does heroin. So he's wrong, right? I hate to do this. All right, we're

(6:14:05) going to go to the next question. Uh, let's see. We have a number of them here. Um, no more those like little $2

(6:14:14) ones. I'm sorry. I'm just too tired to read those. Uh, Dan Otis Driftwood says, "Catholic here.

(6:14:22) Andrew destroyed. Shave your arms." They want you to shave your arms in some sort

(6:14:29) of ritualistic enactment. Mark Jordan Thomas says, "Would the world be a

(6:14:34) better place if tomorrow every human on earth became a true atheist or true Christian for both?" Okay. Well, we've

(6:14:41) already heard Mark answer it like twice. So, Andrew, what do you have?

(6:14:46) I Well, can you repeat the question? Would the world be a better place tomorrow if if every human on earth

(6:14:54) became a true true atheist or a true Christian? Oh, well, I think the world would be a better place if more people were sick.

(6:15:00) So, drug prices went down, right, Mark? Okay. Zachary Gelpy says, "Mark, you

(6:15:08) don't even know why the increase in volume, increase in violence in your country is happening, which is very

(6:15:15) sad." I'll give you a chance to respond, Mark.

(6:15:25) I just asked you. There you go. Uh, yeah. Yeah, I I do know why it's happening. Yes. And it wasn't

(6:15:31) specifically about violence in general. It was about violence in schools. But thank you for your, you know, incorrection.

(6:15:38) Zachary Galpy also said, "If it has to do with massive influx of Islamists in your country, just like what just

(6:15:45) happened in Melbourne with that stabbing?" Yeah. Imagine if you had a gun.

(6:15:53) This one. That would be Yeah, that would be awesome if you had a gun. What do you mean? Perpetrator had a gun. No, if you, the

(6:15:59) defender, had a gun, that would be great. Technician the

(6:16:05) 12th says, "Mark, if America wasn't an ally and the superpower of the world

(6:16:12) protecting your freedoms, would you be more concerned not having firearms,

(6:16:18) right?" Um, yeah. I mean, if we have less allies, um, but, you know, we still have

(6:16:23) a military. We still have a very effective military. Um, you know, obviously America is is huge, but we're

(6:16:30) also part of the Commonwealth as well, which is, um, England, um, you know,

(6:16:35) Canada, uh, all of the the ex Britritish nations. So, we still have allies around

(6:16:40) the world, even without America. And, you know, big deal. We we've gone to war for you guys before as well.

(6:16:47) As well, you should, peasant. What is uh, treat your allies well. That's that's

(6:16:53) good. See how that turns out for you. It's turned out pretty well so far. You do whatever we say.

(6:16:59) You're kind of our [ __ ] You're kind of our [ __ ] Canada defend you right now. Yeah.

(6:17:05) Goat Hub. Oh, you think so? Interesting. Goat Hub. All right. Good. Goat Hub says, "Thank you so much for getting

(6:17:10) King Neptune on. Good debate." Um, who's King Neptune? I have no idea. This one from Dalomar

(6:17:18) says, "This guy is UN one world citizen propagandized

(6:17:25) beyond hope and should never comment on the illegal alien situation in America."

(6:17:32) Again, he is a euro neoist atheist. Europe and the UK are having so

(6:17:39) much fun with this type. Oh, I I I'm It's It's always hilarious how little Americans know about

(6:17:45) geography that like Australia isn't in Europe, but well done. Good try. It's not Wait, it's not

(6:17:52) Texas. Wait, wait, it's not in Europe. There's the guy that says he's smart.

(6:17:57) Yeah. What the [ __ ] I didn't know that [ __ ] It's not actually in Europe. I didn't even I didn't even think it existed, but

(6:18:03) I at least if I if it existed, I thought it would be in Europe. It's funny cuz some people don't think it exists. that religious guys don't

(6:18:10) think it exists. They just literally don't think that the government made it up to try and you know it's hilarious. They actually believe that. I mean if

(6:18:17) you believe that you really believe that you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] Like I believe that I think I

(6:18:22) think there's no way there's no way to as stupid as as stupid as you are. I

(6:18:28) don't think you're that stupid. There's no way that you there's no way I don't think you are. Wait, what was it that you guys are

(6:18:34) saying you don't believe exists? What was it, Andrew?

(6:18:39) Oh, Australia. It's not a real country. It's fake. Oh, you know what? You can prove me wrong right now.

(6:18:45) Right this second. If you can reach in your back pocket and pull out Australian currency, go ahead and try it.

(6:18:51) Um, no, I can't. I do everything. Yeah, exactly. Cuz you have a fake ass [ __ ] country. That's why.

(6:18:57) Um, here is an Australian coin that I've got for my wallet. Oh, yeah. Anybody can have something

(6:19:02) like that. Why don't you have actual currency, sir? See that? It's got um one of the native

(6:19:08) Australians on it. Whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Show me the currency. Show me the currency.

(6:19:13) It's got native Australian on it with the southern cross and $2. And on the

(6:19:19) back Sure. Mhm. It's got um a picture of Queen Victoria,

(6:19:24) which when it was minted. So that is Australian currency. And this is a representation of the flat

(6:19:29) earth. You can see right here that this was

(6:19:35) made in I don't look I don't believe you because like you know I think you're stupid. I

(6:19:42) don't think you're that stupid. I really I want to give you the benefit of the doubt that you're not a [ __ ] like there's no way Australia atheist. Come

(6:19:47) on. There's no way. We're going to go. No, you're just trolling. You're just trolling. He's totally trolling. Okay. Uh, a

(6:19:54) airborne animal says, "There are many atheists that hate that there is anything that can associate them with

(6:20:00) you, Mark. Andrew is a light in the darkness that you are an active part of

(6:20:06) Mark. May you They're entitled to their opinion. They're entitled to their opinion."

(6:20:11) This one from Texas and their opinion is also correct. Says, "Mark, how would you

(6:20:18) how would you The camera's blurry, by the way, Mark, back up a little bit." Yeah. Yeah. It's because I shoved the

(6:20:24) coin up. It refocused, which you probably Yeah, that's why I say back up and it'll autofocus.

(6:20:29) Literally, just back up and move in a little more. No, no. Back up a little more like this

(6:20:36) and then move in. Yeah, that did not work. Actually, it is working. You just I think you got to back up a little more.

(6:20:42) But okay, I'm not even being a dick. I'm just telling you for autofocus. I'm I'm pretty good with cameras. That's all.

(6:20:48) One sec. Yeah, give me one sec. I'll just have to do this. Andrew is admittedly actually pretty good at um

(6:20:55) tech stuff. I'm better. I'm better. This one from Jelly says, "Mark, you

(6:21:02) cannot take anything. You are so sensitive. You have probably never had one bad experience ever in your life. I

(6:21:09) bet you room kids in VR chat. What does that mean?"

(6:21:16) Well, I mean, if you can take six hours of somebody being a child and insulting you, you go right ahead. I'm not sure that you can. I think that you would

(6:21:22) probably be frustrated as well because that's the intention and that's why these aren't debates. They're uh Wilson

(6:21:28) being a child. They're a child care for Andrew. I would have done a time debate. I've done them before many times.

(6:21:35) It's up to you how you wanted to debate, Mark. Remember how you called me a coward on your stream? Said I wouldn't show up. Bet you wish I would have slept

(6:21:41) in today. No, not really. I think it's wonderful that you've just shown your character. I think it's awesome. You know, you're a

(6:21:48) racist. You're obstinate. You're horrible adjectives, but I still won the debate. Mark,

(6:21:55) keep thinking that. Sure. All of you watch. You wouldn't even defend your position. You're you're terrible. You're

(6:22:00) absolutely terrible. What was my position? That Christianity was better for society. Oh, you had no foundation.

(6:22:06) Why do I need a foundation to prove it's better for society? Why? Why is that a necessity? Dummy.

(6:22:12) You can't justify it's better for society at all. Oh, well then neither can you. I just took your position, Mark. Uh that is a

(6:22:18) two croquet. That is and that's the seen. Yes, it is.

(6:22:23) Oh my god. A two quoqu is what about you? I'm not saying what about you. It's actually translates more accurately and

(6:22:30) you it translates more accurately to and you also.

(6:22:36) So what about you? Same thing. What about you? Literally the same thing. Yeah. Yeah,

(6:22:42) you are when you basically when you do a parody of what I believe and you basically do that, that is called a

(6:22:49) straw man. You weren't representing my beliefs. You were representing some other set of beliefs that weren't mine.

(6:22:54) So you absolutely did nothing except show how foolish you are because you won't even like like support your own

(6:23:01) position. So you basically failed completely. Said, "Hey, I'm delusional. I've got no idea what I'm doing." Straw

(6:23:07) mananded my position and then said, "Well, then it's better for for everything. You're a But Mark, if it is the case that I have

(6:23:15) no stance independent ought, you can't even tell me why any of that's wrong.

(6:23:22) Well, which is better for society? I leave that up to the audience. Would would a society where a delusional

(6:23:27) madman who cuddles his gun at night be better? Or would a society where people take care of each other are better?

(6:23:32) Well, I would think I would think that I'm not asking you. I don't give a [ __ ] what you think. I'm asking the audience

(6:23:38) for them. I'm not allowed to I'm not allowed to say anything back. Well, that's the point of a debate. They decide. I present what how I get to what is

(6:23:44) better. And you are hateful, bigoted, obnoxious, racist, and then you go, "Oh, will it be better if we were all

(6:23:50) You want to take our guns, have a have a have autonomy and authority over everybody's life. Make sure that you

(6:23:55) trans all the kids." Yeah, great. Mark, I don't have autonomy over when come in.

(6:24:01) No straw, man. Well done. Stuff that straw. You straw. Keep on stuffing that straw. Oh, yeah. Now we should have

(6:24:07) speed limits because it's it's totalitarianism. Oh, we shouldn't have guns because you also have speed limits.

(6:24:12) No, no, it's it's all totalitarianism. Yeah, you were wrong on everything. We should be able to get rid of illegal immigrants cuz we also have speed

(6:24:18) limits. Everything about Australia and you still think you know better about what's happening on I do know what's better than you about

(6:24:24) everything, Mark. On about everything. Yeah. Well done. Well done. Well done, mate. Keep saying that.

(6:24:31) I'd be so willing to say everything. Everything. Everything. Yes. Everything. Yeah. So, so what is the protocol for

(6:24:37) Wi-Fi? What does that mean? Oh, I thought you knew better than me.

(6:24:43) I thought you knew better. So, you know networking and and integrated circuit systems connections better than me. Is

(6:24:48) that what you're saying? Probably. Yeah, probably. I do, actually. Okay. So, what is the protocol for Wi-Fi? What does that mean, though?

(6:24:56) You're a [ __ ] idiot. You're an idiot. You're absolutely [ __ ] idiot. That that's a technical question on the next

(6:25:04) subject for Wi-Fi is a technical question. This is from jelly. They say Mark

(6:25:10) Christianity affect you. How does Christianity affect me? Um it

(6:25:16) puts in place a number of Yeah. one sentence. It puts in place a number of laws and restrictions that are

(6:25:23) based upon people's uh um appeal to a divinity. They cannot show and cannot

(6:25:28) prove. This one from as opposed to my feelings which I cannot show and cannot prove.

(6:25:35) This one's from FK Button. They say at least I get agreement from others.

(6:25:40) They say good news is if we had 20 times the moss the moss

(6:25:47) the uh the moss s h o o t i n g s. You

(6:25:53) claim we do only another 1,000 years and we start to get close to the amount

(6:25:59) offed by secularists. I think they probably mean but like Mao and Pa.

(6:26:04) Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. But I mean Mao and and Stalin and stuff I mean most of the people they killed and you know they

(6:26:11) absolutely did horrible things. Don't get me wrong. It's just most of the people was from sheer incompetence and starvation and absolutely terrible

(6:26:18) behavior along with goulash and mass murder. But they're secularists and they're not secular humanists. So unless you've got

(6:26:23) a debate against secularism in general, then you're [ __ ] out of luck. Sorry. Oh, that's fair. Do secular humanists

(6:26:30) derive many of their world views from enlightenment principles?

(6:26:36) Yes. And would you say that enlightenment principles were the same views that like the French Revolution

(6:26:41) were under where they were beheading everybody and that communism also adapted when they were citing um these

(6:26:48) types of principles especially continental philosophy for Marxism things like this? Would you say that

(6:26:54) those were the same influences as secular humanism? They are influenced by same things. But

(6:27:00) would you say that the uh cults that have arised in you know these Jesus cults that kill people as well as your

(6:27:05) own church came from the same origin as well? Well, I I would definitely say that they were influenced by Christianity in some

(6:27:11) way. Yeah. And so you would say the same thing, right? Right.

(6:27:16) But if it's the case then that if we're just talking about influences, then we would have to make denominational

(6:27:21) specific uh allocations for these atrocities the same way that we would with secularists,

(6:27:27) right? No. Then why didn't you do that? Instead, you try to place Christianity at the feet. Like for instance, the

(6:27:33) Inquisitions, the Inquisition, which you know was specifically

(6:27:38) uh Spaniards for the most part and Catholics. You lay that at the feet of all Christianity. Why do you do that

(6:27:44) when you know you're supposed to make it denominational specific by your own logic that you just gave us? Go to the next one.

(6:27:50) No, no, really. Let him answer. If you know we're supposed to make it denominational specific, why do you lay the Inquisition at the feet of all

(6:27:56) Christians like you did here? The title of the debate is specific to secular humanism and not secularism, but

(6:28:02) the title of the debate also says Christianity and not one specific sect or denomination.

(6:28:09) If you wanted a different debate, ask for a different debate topic. You're in this one. So, tough [ __ ]

(6:28:14) So, just to make sure that I got this right, all Christian. Is it Christianity or is it a a denomination of Christianity?

(6:28:20) Christianity. All the Ask me that question. Is it in the title? Is it Christianity or is it a denomination of

(6:28:26) Christianity? Because I can't read it at the moment. Christianity, but you never told me. It's Christianity. Thank you. What is Christianity? What is it? What

(6:28:32) is it? You never told us what it is. Next one. You never told us what it is, doofus

(6:28:38) ever. You never told us what Christianity Thank you. The title is Christianity. What is Christianity? Can you even tell

(6:28:44) us? [ __ ] off. I'm not Yeah, you don't even know. You don't even [ __ ] know, dummy. No. people that follow the teachings of

(6:28:52) Jesus Christ. Secular humanists are anybody who follows anything which is relational to

(6:28:58) uh the ethics of secular humanism as put in their manifesto which would include communist. It would include what

(6:29:05) happened revolution. Oh, do you want me to give you in your secular humanist manifesto almost damn

(6:29:13) near word for word what you can find by Karl Marx? Would that be enough for you to then concede?

(6:29:18) Are you saying close enough? Are you saying that communism in Russia, I presume that you're you're referring

(6:29:24) to, was secular humanist in nature? The difference between you and I.

(6:29:29) Oh, no. I'm willing to whatever whatever me.

(6:29:34) Yes. Yes. It's the same. Yes. By your logic, it's exactly the same. Correct. Yeah. So, this is the lies we get like

(6:29:41) just cornity. He's supposed to defend all of

(6:29:46) Christianity. He wants to shend all of Christianity. There was a great church over here and I

(6:29:51) know I'm a douchebag, but I'm going to be associated with this good church. I'm going to just appeal to them, you know, even though I'm supposed to be defending

(6:29:57) all of Christianity. That is a complete dodge. You know what? I'm actually even still

(6:30:03) willing to grant this and say that society under the Catholic Inquisition is better than [ __ ] anything you have

(6:30:09) given us tonight for why secular humanism was better than that. So instead of my worldview, you would

(6:30:15) rather torture people. Can you just confirm that? Some people maybe you would be willing to torture some people too.

(6:30:22) Your your Christian representative and he would also be willing to torture some people. What do you mean?

(6:30:28) I would be. Yeah. Secular humanist would be. You Well, like if Why would I do that? You know, you said

(6:30:35) I would. Why would I do that? Well, when I said you, it's a euphemism for secular humanist.

(6:30:40) You think secular humanist would torture people? Sure. Like uh terrorist. Yeah. Terrorist. The weed in that pipe.

(6:30:47) Hey, I'll prove it. Terrorist has nuclear launch codes. They're nuke's going to go off in 5 hours. You have him

(6:30:53) in custody. Would you torture him for the codes? No. Torture doesn't work.

(6:30:58) Uh what if you knew that in this case torture would work? Would you torture? Oh, the hypothetical. Let's change

(6:31:04) reality. So the reasons why torture doesn't work. Torture does work in some cases. You can't even deny that.

(6:31:09) No. No. The experts say, "Hey, they will tell you. not say anywhere

(6:31:14) that torture never works. No expert will ever tell you torture doesn't all they'll never tell you

(6:31:20) torture never works. No expert anywhere. And if somebody is fundamentally like that serious about it, are they going to

(6:31:26) tell you? Yes, they could. Yes. And torture does often work. What the experts say is

(6:31:32) this. What they actually say is there are times where you will torture a person where you feel like you're not

(6:31:38) getting the answers as a torturer and so they'll give you false answers. That's true. But that's not to say torture

(6:31:44) never works. You'll never show me a study on planet Earth that torture doesn't work to get confessions out of

(6:31:51) people for information ever. Let's let's compare the scenarios here. Let's compare the scenarios. Wilson

(6:31:57) would torture and and torture people because he doesn't want another person

(6:32:02) like me to have any power in the thing. He said instead of having a torture a terrorist I would torture people.

(6:32:08) I would torture terrorist. You said you would torture people and I said really and you said some people. Yeah. Yeah. Some people gave you the one of

(6:32:15) the what is the example of the some people I gave like a terrorist. You said you wouldn't. I said I would. That's the difference of

(6:32:22) having um my system as being any kind of representative in your country. You would rather torture some people and do

(6:32:30) that. And then when I said I wouldn't torture someone, you basically go, "Yeah, shift." That's literally

(6:32:35) Wow. You're doing more goalpost shifting than FIFA International. This is what I said. This was literally

(6:32:41) my position. Incredible. You said you you were torture. You said, "Would you be willing to torture people?" I said, "Some people."

(6:32:47) And then gave you what example? Yeah. Yeah. And then you're like, "Oh, oh." And you said, "I would never torture

(6:32:52) judges very the very bald and dumb or torture never works cuz I'm bald and

(6:32:58) dumb." That's what your position, your official position is. I'm bald and

(6:33:03) stupid and torture doesn't work ever. Cuz I'm a secular human. It's the

(6:33:08) dumbest [ __ ] I ever heard. Bro, torture does work. Just because you're dumb doesn't mean torture doesn't work.

(6:33:15) So you just torture people instead of having a system of government while you have to make up this ridiculous example

(6:33:21) of them in order to actually get something like

(6:33:27) you are insane. You you are insane. That's a great argument. I'm insane. Yeah.

(6:33:32) You would go, "Oh, I've tortured someone instead of having a system like yours. There was no nuke in there." Then you want to shift the goalpost and say,

(6:33:38) "Well, only if you have a system and there's a person with a nuclear bomb." No, that's not what you said. And you are so dishonest for pretending it is

(6:33:44) what you said. You are an absolute dishonest and you are just leaving the

(6:33:49) coast because you've been caught out saying, "Hey, I would dishonest." What do you think is best for society?

(6:33:55) Somebody will torture people at the top of that or somebody that will never want to torture people. This guy is so

(6:34:03) violent, horrible, people. No, go torture people. I'm sure

(6:34:08) you torture your audience all the time. I mean, I would be watching you. torture them with great entertainment.

(6:34:14) Like yeah, yeah, torture them by racism and bigotry. Yeah. Well done. Racism class

(6:34:21) act. A class act. Let's go to the next question. into societ. You're a disgrace.

(6:34:29) Terrible. I'm awful. This one they say

(6:34:35) rable wobble finally responds to Mark in

(6:34:42) Eat's native language. I think they're making fun of your language. Um

(6:34:50) I don't know if they mean like your Australian accent. Yeah. No, it's just the American

(6:34:56) education system doesn't teach English properly. So, you know, I have to forgive that. I mean, Andrew's been mispronouncing stuff all night, but you

(6:35:02) know, whatever. Dan Vicious says, "Good work tonight, James." Thank you, Dan. Huge you guys,

(6:35:08) folks. Um, the debaters make this happen. They are linked in the description. Even if you disagree with

(6:35:13) them, go and um don't harass them at their channel. But

(6:35:18) no, I'm getting tons of people in from from Andrews. I don't I don't think he's serious in stopping people. I think

(6:35:24) that's a that's a that's a dog whistle, isn't it? It's a dog whistle. It's you saying, "Hey, don't do this." Listen, that's signaling to people to do it.

(6:35:30) This is This is Andrew logic. He's signaling to people to do it. Isn't that right, Andrew? Isn't that right? Yep.

(6:35:35) Okay, good to know. Dog whistle. Andrew Andrew wants to respond, I think. Go ahead. Do you want to respond?

(6:35:41) Yeah. Tell me their names. And if they're in my chat right now, I'll ban them.

(6:35:47) Go ahead. Tell me what they're saying, which is actual harassment. Tell me what they're saying that's actual harassment. I'll

(6:35:52) ban them from my chat right now. Go ahead. I'll get I'll get mods to make a list. How about that? No, I want to know a

(6:35:58) single person right now who's harassing you from my chat. What's their name?

(6:36:04) Um, I will just And what is the thing they're saying that you consider harassment to be?

(6:36:09) It better not be I disagree with you or they think you're dumb. It better be actual [ __ ] harassment.

(6:36:30) Are they making fun of your appearance, Mark? Yeah, I'm I'm going up. I mean, he he

(6:36:36) wants to know it. Uh Mark argues like a woman.

(6:36:41) That's not harassment. It sure is. No, it isn't. You argue like a woman.

(6:36:48) That is not harassment, dude. Give me a [ __ ] break. Mark's a stupid

(6:36:54) [ __ ] Oh, it's harassment. Give me a [ __ ] break. Yeah, I don't go into your chat and do

(6:36:59) that, do I? You don't have a chat to do it with, but even if you did, I would

(6:37:04) Yeah, that makes it right. Consider it harassment monster. You monster. I still I'm just going up now.

(6:37:10) There's been uh there's been tons of it.

(6:37:16) Oh, chatter say mean thing. That's not harassment, dude. That's not what harassment means.

(6:37:23) Would you like me to tell you what harassment is? an extended uh series of unex unwanted

(6:37:30) um interactions that are insulting and demeaning. So why aren't you banning them from your chat?

(6:37:35) Oh, we we are. Okay. Well, then here's the thing. If they harass you past them getting

(6:37:40) banned, like they're contacting you on other platforms, things like that, that would be harassment. I see. I see. Now it's Now it's goal

(6:37:48) shift again. Oh, the goals just moved. How many? No, I don't consider it that harassment. The goals moved. It just moved.

(6:37:54) considerate harassment. No, you didn't add that, did you? No, you just added it. You dishonest [ __ ] You are such a dishonest [ __ ] Dishonest

(6:38:02) [ __ ] on the internet. That would be harassment. Absolute. Everyone's terrible. Crazy ape. Crazy ape. You're

(6:38:10) crazy. Ape. You are the greasiest racist ape in the world. Everyone's crazy, Mark. I know. Someone

(6:38:16) said, this one from Mazul. Fascists were socialists and atheists. COVID vaccine

(6:38:24) was oh COVID serum

(6:38:30) um and in fact we'll just call it the roid serum was not a serum did not

(6:38:39) prevent so red or infections

(6:38:47) give you a chance if you want to respond to that Mark because I want to be fair and give you response even no I passed because if I respond to it,

(6:38:54) I'm I'm I'm signaling and stuff like that. So, you know, Andrew's crazy crazy I'll call it charitably logic that if

(6:39:00) hey, if you say hey, we shouldn't talk about that because this will have seriously what the [ __ ] am I supposed to do? So, wow. Um James, this has been

(6:39:07) going on for ages, mate. Can we wrap it up because I'm really I'm I'm really sort of getting getting burnt out on

(6:39:12) this one. Yes, Dad knows best. Actually put in the last super chat. Actually, there's one last one other after this. Forgive me.

(6:39:19) Said James, stop taking super chats. This is now going on six hours. Mark, you were okay. So, another one came in. Uh, Mari

(6:39:25) said, "Stop being a [ __ ] baby, Mark." So, that's the kind of stuff that you you love your followers doing. Sure.

(6:39:33) Is that an interaction you would approve of, Andrew, or is that something that isn't harassment of them coming into my

(6:39:39) chat and doing that? Is this moral for you? Is that what it is? Moral. Christian

(6:39:45) morals. I don't know, dude. I keep getting muted, so I can't actually respond to

(6:39:50) any of this. But here's the thing. I'll just make this uh abundantly clear. What did the guy say?

(6:39:57) Uh stop being a [ __ ] baby Mark. So why don't you stop doing that?

(6:40:04) How's that harassment? Really? Yeah. Oh, so you're sending your audience over to insult. I didn't send anybody over.

(6:40:09) That's what harassment is. That's not That is not harassment that you're in a live people go over to your

(6:40:15) chat to say things. That's not harassment. We don't know what harassment. Sorry about this. Okay, let's go to the

(6:40:22) next. We've got just like two or three more questions here. Uh, folks, no more questions, please. Dad knows best, says

(6:40:28) James, stop taking chats. Um, Mark, you're arguing with a rhetoric with an

(6:40:33) entourage. Then, Arma Jetics says, "When a soy boy who screams like a a a wimp

(6:40:40) when his finger gets scratched by a mosquito tells you torture doesn't work." I don't even know what the hell

(6:40:47) this is talking about. Uh, this one coming in from

(6:40:53) Why do they want you to shave your arms for them, Mark? This is some sort of sexual ritual. Uh,

(6:41:01) the Jabroni says, "We say we say way worse stuff directly to Andrew on his

(6:41:06) chat." Um, and then that Ketune says, "I'm in Andrew's chat. There's

(6:41:12) definitely harassers, quote unquote." Um, and then I think that might be it.

(6:41:17) Let me just double check. I think we gotten them. But I want to say folks, oh yeah, what's up Mark?

(6:41:25) Yeah. So, I just want to point out they're also coming in and saying the A word, which is like the N word in Australia. So, yeah, this is definitely

(6:41:31) going on. I don't think Andrew is serious at all. I think he's encouraging people to do it because he's a [ __ ] Um, so you know, I I I really think

(6:41:37) that, you know, if he's promoting racist behavior and gaslighting and and dog whistling for this to happen, well,

(6:41:44) maybe there should be some repercussions if you are violating YouTube's terms of service. What do you think, Andrew? Some violations of YouTube terms of service.

(6:41:57) Oh, yeah. Andrew wants to respond. Yeah. Yeah. I'd love to hear him respond. You're right. Go mass report this

(6:42:02) [ __ ] idiot's channel for violating the terms of service if he wants to do it that way. Go [ __ ] go mass report

(6:42:07) this [ __ ] idiot's channel if that's the way he wants to do it. I didn't say that. I didn't say that. Then stop then stop that [ __ ] I don't

(6:42:14) [ __ ] doing it. Listen. It's you. You gaslight people and say

(6:42:21) you want to play you want to play that there needs to be repercussions. Watch the repercussions. [ __ ] Watch. You want

(6:42:27) to [ __ ] play that game or do you want to backtrack and say this is a debate. It got a little lively. That's okay. We

(6:42:34) don't do mass reporting here. We're definitely not gonna [ __ ] go after somebody's channel. Can we both agree

(6:42:39) that that's true? No. I'm I'm basically saying, "Hey, you're dog whistling for this to happen.

(6:42:44) Don't do this. I'm telling you, it's going to end badly for you. Just back off." All right. Just back off. We'll both back off,

(6:42:50) right? Nobody's trying to [ __ ] mass report your channel. Yeah, you guys just at least agree. Can we at

(6:42:56) least agree? Because here's the problem, Mark. When you have a chat as large as mine, I'm just going to be totally straight

(6:43:02) with you. You are going to get [ __ ] Looney Tunes who will do [ __ ] like that. I'm actually trying to back that off.

(6:43:09) Don't Don't push that. There's no reason to. Nobody's allowed to go [ __ ] mass report this guy's channel. Nobody. I'm

(6:43:17) just simply using a rhetorical Hang on. Hang on, Mark. I'm just simply because I'm not doing that [ __ ]

(6:43:22) bro. YouTube doesn't care. Why don't you get this? YouTube doesn't give a [ __ ] YouTube's going to just look at [ __ ]

(6:43:29) their AI is going to pick it up. They'll strike the channel. Just stop with that. We don't That doesn't even need to be

(6:43:34) what happens here. Everybody needs to back off and cool off here. This is a debate. I don't have anything personal

(6:43:41) against this guy. Don't flag his channel, right? Don't do any [ __ ] like that. There's nothing personal here. I

(6:43:48) don't take any of this [ __ ] personally and I never will. Then maybe stop being a [ __ ] Shut up, dude. Shut your [ __ ] ass up.

(6:43:54) I'm trying to save your ass. Shut up. Oh, you're saving me. Yeah. No, I'll take my chances.

(6:43:59) Well, good luck. Good luck, Mark. I tried, Mark. Okay. Okay. Um,

(6:44:05) racist piece of [ __ ] So,

(6:44:12) we'll probably just try to finish these questions. So, Dalomar says, "America

(6:44:19) better than being cocked by a wannabe European um Australian country.

(6:44:26) I know that these seem like uh I don't know. Uh

(6:44:32) oh, Andrew. Sorry, James. This has got to end, man. This is going on what? Eight freaking almost seven hours. Come

(6:44:40) on. This is getting ridiculous. Like, seriously, mate. This has got to end." I'll let you out. So what we'll do is

(6:44:45) folks uh check out just to learn. There is a

(6:44:53) value in hearing people's positions straight from them

(6:44:59) rather than hearing what people say that they say. You can hear it straight from them. So there's a value in going to

(6:45:05) their channel. They are linked in the description box. Uh I do want to say the

(6:45:10) debaters are the lifeblood of the channel. We appreciate them being here. Andrew and Mark, it's been a pleasure to

(6:45:16) have you guys on tonight. It has been truly like one of the most engaged uh

(6:45:21) streams that we've ever had. So, thank you gentlemen for being

(6:45:27) here tonight. Yeah, I appreciate it very much, James.

(6:45:33) It was very kind of you to have me on. Um I'm willing to still stay through every super chat. I don't care. This is

(6:45:38) work. This is what work is. I I the the the incredible amount of

(6:45:45) racism, horrible stuff. I'll just sum up and sort of say this is absolutely atrocious. This wasn't a debate. This

(6:45:51) was a travesty. Um wow. Wow.

(6:45:57) Words hurt, Mark. Words hurt. Secular humanist can't take words.

(6:46:02) We'll let you go, Mark. I know you have to go. Have a good day.

(6:46:08) What we're going to do, folks, is try to get through any last super chats that have come in that weren't read. Is give

(6:46:13) me one second here. Uh, let's see.

(6:46:18) Okay. Let me just reload.

(6:46:35) In terms of upcoming stuff, I'll also share about that in just a minute. Folks, we do have a ton of upcoming

(6:46:41) events, including with Andrew, uh, August 8th. That'll be in Chicago. If

(6:46:47) you would like to debate Andrew, this is your opportunity. We will be in Chicago.

(6:46:52) Very central location, by the way. So, if you're kind of like, "Hey, uh, I live

(6:46:57) on the East Coast or the West Coast." just like, well, this is probably uh not too far of a trip then because

(6:47:06) Chicago's right dab in the middle. B Jabroni uh says uh let's see

(6:47:13) that Katsune says I'm in Andrew's chat. There's definitely harassers. Do you shave your arms, Mark? Uh when a soy boy

(6:47:20) seems like a bit Let's see. America, I think we've gotten it. Oh, we did miss

(6:47:26) this early bird 2448. This is for you, Andrew. I think by most metrics like education, quality of life, life

(6:47:32) expectancy, secular countries are better off than most religious countries, Andrew.

(6:47:40) Oh, are you on mute? Sorry about that. There it is. Okay. What? Yeah. Which

(6:47:47) ones? Like for instance, infant mortality in the United States.

(6:47:53) Infant mortality in the United States is one of the highest in the entirety of the first world.

(6:47:59) You also have problems with mass migration, cultural cohesion. You have all sorts of other issues. Even if it was the case that life expectancy

(6:48:05) slightly went up, it could also be the case that the quality of life goes down.

(6:48:10) The thing that's really interesting here is like I'm willing to adopt the secularist worldview in order to see it

(6:48:17) in order to just stress test what the social ramifications are. the distinction between Christian societies

(6:48:23) and secular societies. I always find secular societies to come up wanting. This guy was so pissed off because he

(6:48:29) wanted to have a foundational debate about um whether or not God is real. Atheists always do this. They don't want

(6:48:36) to talk about the effects of their policies. Like they can't tell the difference between a man and a woman, right? They they never want to talk

(6:48:42) about the effects. I want to actually discuss the effects. If it's really true that secular humanism is better for

(6:48:48) humanity, show us the effects. And they can't because all effects that

(6:48:54) they show is just we're going to take your guns, we're going to take your freedom, we're going to be just as totalitarian as the people who we think

(6:49:00) are totalitarian. It's ridiculous. This one from Red Fox says, "Andrew, how's your back feeling after carrying

(6:49:06) that debate?" Looks like you have a fan. Oh, wait. Well, actually James James carried it.

(6:49:11) So, James was here for many, many hours. Um, that was a very spirited back and

(6:49:16) forth. This guy that I'm debating, you guys have to understand. He's probably never had a serious blood sport debate

(6:49:22) like that before. Um, I'm I'm always in it for the for the long haul. He

(6:49:28) probably doesn't understand. We have internet codes. No snitching, none of that. Like, you don't ever do that.

(6:49:34) Those are the rules. You know what I mean? Because of that, um, he probably

(6:49:39) he he probably came in with a very different expectation. He thought for some reason that I was supposed to sit

(6:49:45) there and just shut up and do whatever he said. Uh that's not ever going to happen. Now, if he had had if he had

(6:49:51) asked for a different institution of rules like uh two-minute back and forth openings, um you know, we at this point

(6:49:59) cross-examination, this point isn't. There are people who have requested that. I've done many of those debates.

(6:50:05) I'm happy to do those, too. But this this [ __ ] guy was like, "This this person's too much of a [ __ ] to debate

(6:50:11) me." It's like, well, here I am. He's not here. Where is he? Oh, he couldn't go the

(6:50:17) duration. Huh? This one from um Yes, this definitely was like a

(6:50:26) Warski live feeling old blood sports true slobber knocker. And

(6:50:38) I like those sometimes, James. I like them sometimes. Sometimes I don't, sometimes I do.

(6:50:43) I don't, frankly, I don't mind them. Um, at some point I'm like, "Okay, guys."

(6:50:50) But at the same time, I uh I don't know. This one from Jake Smith says, "Jakey,

(6:50:56) uh, I'm Australian from the Nurunga people from South Australia, and they

(6:51:01) said, "Abbo is not offensive. It's not the same as the N word. Andrew has Nuranga backing." Okay. I don't know.

(6:51:09) Uh, I haven't like looked into these terms. It's not. No, listen. He's a

(6:51:14) progressive. He He has a progressive Australian mindset. He's always going to say these words are are taboo or banned

(6:51:22) or this or that. They're not banned. And it doesn't have the same um the same

(6:51:28) type of thing that the nword does in the US. It's all [ __ ] It's all nonsense. You can talk to people from

(6:51:34) Australia, they'll tell you the same thing. From

(6:51:39) his view, I'm sure it's it's like it I mean, from his view, I'm sure it's terrible, but that doesn't mean objectively it is.

(6:51:48) It was a lively debate. What I do want to show people is folks,

(6:51:55) I'm going to crop the screen here. Andrew Wilson will be in Chicago uh August 8th.

(6:52:02) I will be there. Sean Samco from Uncensored America will be there. You don't want to miss it.

(6:52:09) If you would like to debate Andrew, this is your opportunity. Highly encourage you. Come check it out. The reason

(6:52:15) James, is there an audience going to be there or no?

(6:52:22) Because if there's an audience, I can probably fill that audience if you if you guys

(6:52:28) would like. I This is why I'm asking the question. Uh I will be there. I will be doing a debate. James called me. He he

(6:52:35) requested it. I'm happy uh to accommodate. I know that there's going to be some skilled debaters that show up. I'm looking forward to the

(6:52:41) engagement. If James is, you know, if he wants to do a live audience, I'm not adverse to that either, James. I think

(6:52:47) we could do something with that if you wanted to. Yes, that uh I'm open to that. So, what

(6:52:53) we can do is we haven't decided on the venue yet. I'm very confident we'll find

(6:52:58) a venue uh on a Tuesday in Chicago.

(6:53:04) It's possible there might be uh like seating for people to watch it. Let's

(6:53:09) see, live, but I'll update you depending on what venues

(6:53:15) I find tomorrow because I'll be looking tomorrow. I know I found a studio that could work. We might be able to find a

(6:53:21) hotel like meeting room that would fit. Uh let me just get back to you on that. So uh definitely Chicago though folks as

(6:53:28) you can see at the bottom right of your screen in Chicago debate Andrew August 8th email modern day debategmail.com

(6:53:36) if you are like well I don't personally like I can't personally do it but maybe

(6:53:42) you have a friend who is maybe like left-leaning progressive atheist whatever it is please let them know

(6:53:49) because this would be awesome. is uh early bird 2448 says, "Are you guys from Eagle River, Wisconsin? I was just at

(6:53:56) Andy's pontoon saloon last week." No way. Are you serious? There's no way you're serious. That's my my uh cousin.

(6:54:02) That's why I'm wearing this t-shirt. That's like bizarre. I can't believe you're in Eagle River because it's tiny.

(6:54:07) But yeah, I grew up in Wisconsin. So, born in Michigan. Uh very cold, very

(6:54:14) cold Friday morning I was born. But the point is, [ __ ] cheese head.

(6:54:19) Yes. big time. Wait, that's racist. That's racist. I'm sorry. I called you a cheese head. It's

(6:54:26) It's over now. I said I said cheese head. But basically, uh, Andrew in his racist

(6:54:32) cheese language will not be allowed at our recording. Uh but folks, if you have

(6:54:39) any friends who are like left-leaning, please do let them know about this and just say, "Hey, modernday

(6:54:44) debategmail.com if you want to go because we are looking to find at least five good debaters." So

(6:54:51) people that have got uh uh basically

(6:54:57) I just have to screenshot this because Tell Parker and Dean to come out to Chicago.

(6:55:04) I can ask um here. Let's just let's just clip it. Parker and Dean, it'll be me versus five

(6:55:11) in a jubilee. Like, so you guys can come in. Let's see what you got. Let's see

(6:55:16) what you got. You guys been ducking, ducking, ducking. I wrecked Parker. Uh I

(6:55:22) wrecked him on um Tucker Carlson, wrecked him other times. Dean, same

(6:55:27) thing. He agreed to multiple debates and then backed out. It's your time to shine. Come on.

(6:55:33) that'd be based as the young people say. Uh but yes, folks, for real, we are excited about this. And then also,

(6:55:40) Debbcon, we are uh let me put that really quick on screen. Uh but yes, folks, if you uh are near

(6:55:48) Eagle River, Wisconsin, go to Andy's Pontoon Saloon. Uh tell him James sent

(6:55:53) you. That's my cousin. He's my boy. Um he'd be pumped to meet you. Let me pull

(6:55:59) this post up. So, basically, Debatecon is going to be

(6:56:05) Saturday, November 15th and Sunday, November 16th in Nashville, Tennessee. We are currently working on getting

(6:56:10) Andrew set up for a debate with Richard Carrier as well as

(6:56:16) uh potentially we're hoping for rationality rules. That's the goal. None neither of those

(6:56:23) have like said yes. In fact, I haven't even pitched it to either yet. So, that's the goal though. We want to get

(6:56:29) big debates. So Richard Carrier has agreed uh to do a debate on a different platform. So the

(6:56:36) thing is is like this debate notwithstanding. I'm always happy if you want you know

(6:56:42) certain rules implemented. I'm fine with that. Right. I'm I'm totally fine with that. But Richard Gary actually agreed

(6:56:49) to do the same debate with this exact topic in fact. So uh I don't see why he

(6:56:55) wouldn't do it on MDD. Happy to accommodate. Would it be this topic that

(6:57:01) was debated tonight? Literally the exact same topic he agreed to. Perfect. Uh but yeah, so that's

(6:57:07) definitely like high probability we can get him to come out for that. Filthy Sanders, thanks for your super chat says Andrew Mark probably Vosch voice

(6:57:33) filled out and uh usually takes like one or two debates always take like a longer a little bit longer than the rest of

(6:57:39) them to confirm. But and I think that's it. Oh wait, let me just show some of

(6:57:44) these other things really quick since we've got um folks do want to let you know.

(6:58:04) in Youngstown, Ohio, August 3rd. Tickets are linked below. They are free. If you were in Ohio or anywhere near, come out

(6:58:11) to Youngstown on Sunday, August 3rd. There going to be two debates. It's going to be huge. Then, uh, folks, if

(6:58:19) you'd be so inclined, we'd love to have you there at the, uh, Outnumbered Destiny edition, uh, Andrew's twin

(6:58:27) brother, Destiny, will be in Los Angeles on August 5th, and we'll be doing an outnumbered recording with him against

(6:58:34) five uh, objectors or participants. So, it'll be a fiveon-one just like you've seen with Andrew. And then, oh yes,

(6:58:40) that's right. I'd mentioned earlier right before the stream started. This coming Friday, Eastern Orthodox versus
