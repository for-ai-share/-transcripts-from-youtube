(0:00) Peter is I don't care about Peter Wright. Can you just give me the proof?
(0:05) Is one of his allies is badgering the witness and has not given proper proper
(0:11) uh proper badgering the witness. This isn't the court of law, dude. Meaning changes over time. Even if you
(0:17) use word with with separate ethmology like Natty does with I don't know how many words that I could list, that
(0:24) doesn't mean that you're referencing the same word because meanings change over time. That's one. And the second thing
(0:30) is I'd actually like to hear the criticisms of Andrew Wilson, not of
(0:35) Peter Wright. That would be great. And I'd like to see actual evidence to back it up instead of speculation.
(0:42) Oo. Wow. Seems like Andrew is already fired up, huh? Woo. Yeah, this should be pretty good.
(0:49) Thank you so much. I appreciate the both of you. A kind reminder to the audience,
(0:54) we are actually not going to go into open panel for this debate. We've got a
(0:59) lot ahead of us. So, we're not going to open up the floodgates of hell. However, we will take time this this afternoon to
(1:06) read and respond to your super chats after we close uh the closing statements. All right, I'm going to kick
(1:14) off. We're going to do a twominut timed sessions uh to kick off with and uh
(1:19) we'll go from there. Nattie, your time starts now. Thank you. So, notice how Andrew did not
(1:26) address a single point that I made um in my opening statement. And that's typical
(1:31) of what he does when he goes in these arguments. And notice also that he claims that everything he says is a
(1:37) joke. Um and then goes right back around and confirms his belief system that I
(1:43) was criticizing in the first place, which we probably we will reveal later on. But I think I will go into for the
(1:50) next uh minute or so into gyocentrism theory itself and why it's important to
(1:56) this discussion and why Andrew actually does believe that the west is gyocentric
(2:02) and dude where did I jump in at? I jumped in like at around the 13 14 minute mark. Like
(2:09) holy cow that's crazy. Andrew's already sick of this woman. Pretty much everything he says about
(2:14) women even when he says he's joking. um is actually rooted in this theory
(2:20) because it's like a presupposition if you're going to take the position that it's women who are the problem. Okay. Um
(2:29) so let's talk about what gynec theory really is. Peter Wright who is pretty
(2:36) much the thinker to Paul Elam the speaker. If anybody knows about men's rights movement which uh Andrew does
(2:43) because he's followed it as well all this time. Um he is the one who comes out and he's like tough laugh ladies you
(2:49) need to pull your gigg girl panties up and be atone for your sins. Uh and but
(2:55) it's actually Peter that was the one who wrote the theory that he uses in his thinking and what he claims is that
(3:01) since the medieval period in Europe um we have been gentric. He says that
(3:08) during chivalry which was a code of conduct of behavior for the nightclass that suddenly this was a conspiracy
(3:14) caused by a group of women who were the ladies of the time who decided to try and make it all about valuing women
(3:20) at the expense of men. Now Andrew says he doesn't have that definition. I'd like to hear what Andrew's definition
(3:27) is. Thank you. Andrew. Yeah. So, uh, notice no criticisms about
(3:34) Andrew, more criticisms about a guy named Peter Wright whose name is not Andrew and how gyocentric theory is or
(3:41) orchestrated and archetyped by Peter Wright and what Peter Wright wants and Peter Wright, Peter Wright, Peter Wright. What she doesn't say is,
(3:48) "Andrew." Instead, she asks me a question. You don't get to come to a debate and ask me what I think. Your job
(3:55) is to come in and show the proof and evidence. Show the evidence that
(4:01) whatever you think I believe gyocentrism is, that's what it is. Show any evidence
(4:06) of this. Your job is to build a case for your stupid [ __ ] crazy worldview. Not for me to answer your dumbass questions
(4:14) to try to build your worldview for you. I didn't address any of your points because you didn't [ __ ] make any
(4:19) points. Here's what you need to do, and this is how you debate. This is why you're part of the never learns your
(4:25) [ __ ] lesson archetype. I'm not here to come in and give you your points for you so that you can then use a bunch of
(4:32) Q&A to try to get to the root of the thing that you think is problematic with me. You can do the Socratic method later
(4:37) in the debate, I suppose. But right now, your job is to actually expound on a case that you make, which ties my view
(4:45) in with this guy by showing actual evidence. And right now, I'm going to show you what's happened. You haven't
(4:51) shown any evidence for any of these claims. Show us the [ __ ] evidence. Never learns Natty. Show us the evidence
(4:57) never learns her lesson. Natty, where's the evidence of any of this? It's nice that you just went on a diet tribe about
(5:02) what you think the ethmology of the word gyocentrism is. What the [ __ ] it got to do with Andrew Wilson? We still don't
(5:08) know. What's it got to do with him? Andrew needs to tell us what his version of gyocentrism is. No, the [ __ ] I don't.
(5:14) You came in with the claim. The claim that Andrew believes X. It's on you. you
(5:19) the claimer to show us that what you're saying is true using evidence. Natty,
(5:27) can you show us any evidence? I like that nickname. Never learns.
(5:33) Natty. That's perfect. You notice that when he was talking though, she like made fun of his smoking. Like that's
(5:40) like always her go-to now. It's always a he smokes and ah he's mean, you know, now ah he can't open the olive jars.
(5:48) But uh it's always shows that they got really nothing when they have to resort to the ah well you smoke and ah you're
(5:54) mean and all these things. N too. Okay. Andrew Rachel Wilson your wife she
(6:02) includes the theory in her book and when we have previous encounter we have numerous witnesses who admit that Rachel
(6:09) has been uh in guidance with Peter Wright who was a a paying member of her
(6:15) Patreon. And we there's actually receipts of her going back and who the hell is Peter Wright
(6:21) forth in conversation with him. She also also uses distinctly the uh theory that
(6:27) I just mentioned and the information regarding the claim that chivalry became about centering women at the expense of
(6:33) men in her book as part of the her conversation and justification for the
(6:38) view that gyocentrism uh exists in the west. Now I am going to
(6:44) claim Andrew that your talking points that you use all the time in regards to how you frame and speak to women are
(6:50) rooted in acceptance of this worldview and and also they always have an issue how
(6:55) again it's like oh he's mean like how he speaks to women like how does he speak to women it's the same thing like with
(7:01) Trump like because Trump like uh criticized Rosie O'Donnell and called her fat look how he speaks about women
(7:08) it's like what like Andrew speaks that way to men too. You got like It's so funny. They're all about equality and
(7:15) all this stuff, but yet when you just speak you're you're a little mean to women. You're a little harsh with women. Oh my god, what a misogynist. Look how
(7:21) he speaks to women. Oh my gosh. Make it make sense. And you keep going on about how you
(7:27) don't know anything about Peter, right? But your wife does and she's admitted that on a space and people have
(7:32) witnessed and heard it. Um, you can keep running away from this all you want or you could actually answer the question
(7:39) and tell us whether you believe the west is gyocentric and how what your definition of that term means to you and
(7:46) where you got it from. Okay. So, I'm going to read a little bit more about how gyocentrism is not uh compatible
(7:53) with orthodox belief. Okay. It's based on an anthropological view that's not
(7:58) rooted in how orthodoxy sees a human. I'm not sure if Andrew has ever thought about that because it seems like he just
(8:05) likes to be a contrarian who stands there smoking cigarettes all day until he gets lung cancer or something. I
(8:11) don't know. I don't want that to happen to him. I would like him to actually, you know, try and live up to the ideals
(8:17) he says that he is uh trying to live by the aesthetic life and all that. Andrew,
(8:23) 10 seconds. All right, I'm done now. You can keep going. I question Andrew. Okay. So, I would
(8:29) like to note that instead of her demonstrating any proof once again of
(8:35) her claims, she wants me to answer her questions so that she can try to prove
(8:40) her claims that she made this accusation. Here's the accusation that she made. Andrew and Rachel X. If Andrew
(8:47) Rachel X, I would suppose that you would have some proof. She says that she can prove that Peter Wright was a member of
(8:54) Rachel's Patreon. Okay, show us the proof. She says that she can prove that
(9:00) Peter Wright was in contact with Rachel over the idea of gyocentrism and that must be true because this was included
(9:06) in her book. Okay, show us the proof. All I'm asking for very simply is for
(9:12) Natty, the accuser, and the person who made the claim to show us the evidence of the claim. Instead, Natty
(9:19) continuously just says that I need to answer questions about some [ __ ] perceived worldview she thinks I have.
(9:24) That's great. I'm glad that she really wants me to answer her questions. But if you have a debate prompt which says
(9:32) this, X Wilson X, right, Rachel this, Andrew this, you should be able to
(9:37) demonstrate these things using proof. What's the proof, Natty? I would really
(9:43) like to know. So again, I can just say this over and over and over. And when we
(9:48) get to the Socratic uh part of the debate, you can ask me what you think that my definition of gyocentrism is. I
(9:55) think it's basically a meme. But the thing is is like ultimately uh can you show us the proof?
(10:01) Yeah, those receipts are also sitting right next to the uh the files that were on Bondie's desk
(10:07) now. Like I'll actually wait. I'm going to hold right now. I won't say a word
(10:12) and neither will Sarah. We'll stop the whole stream while you can pull up the proof and show it to us so we can see
(10:19) it. That's why I wanted to do this on video so that there was no way for anybody to be confused about Natty's
(10:25) proof. She could pull it up via video and show it to us. So, go ahead, Natty. All ears.
(10:34) Yeah. So, anyway, um, Orthodox anthropology says that, um, we are that Adam was
(10:42) first. Okay. And that we are made up of spirit and body and soul. The West,
(10:50) however, tends to view the human. I love Andrew's like looking around. I
(10:56) think it's because she's just moving on. She doesn't answer any of his uh his his his response. She just moves on. So,
(11:03) Andrew's like, "Wait, what the hell?" person and human being as mind and body
(11:10) and uh and soul. Okay. And when you hear Andrew's talking points, when he says
(11:16) things like he doesn't want women to have the right to vote and then tries to claim that it's a joke, but then
(11:23) actually in his debates he does fall on that claim quite routinely. When does Andrew say that he think he
(11:29) he's joking when he says he doesn't want women to vote? I I don't think he's ever claimed it was a joke. um that is one of
(11:35) the indicators that he believes the west is gyocentric because the only reason that viewpoint is out there is if you
(11:42) believe that the west is gyocentric or you have what I call a protestant fundamentalist framing um of how you
(11:49) view gender roles. All right. So how Andrew views gender roles from what I
(11:54) have gathered from Andrew's talking points is he believes in the complimentarian Protestant narrative
(12:01) which focuses on the body over the mind and he focuses his whole time
(12:06) criticizing the egletarian position which I would say focuses on the mind over the body and the the viewpoint that
(12:14) that women shouldn't vote is really rooted in the complimentarian position
(12:20) in fact if Andrew didn't have any adherence to that position then he wouldn't be saying it and if he didn't
(12:26) believe the west was gyocentric he also wouldn't be saying that too he would be formulating his arguments in a different
(12:31) manner but he doesn't do that he just goes out there and says these really like arrogant things to women and
(12:39) because he thinks he can intimidate them and then play do rhetorical devices against them he avoids actually being
(12:45) held accountable which is ironic because he's supposed to be representing the patriarchy you're not the patriarchy
(12:51) Andrew, you're a young man or an adolescent male even.
(12:56) Andrew. Okay. So anyway, um I I would just like to point out that after all this incessant prattling, here's the thing
(13:03) that we didn't get. Isn't it amazing that I told you that I would outline this entire debate strategy, she and
(13:09) never learns Natty still would fall prey to it. I asked her for this thing called
(13:14) proof. And the thing that we didn't actually get from Natty was any proof.
(13:20) So Natty starts by making this claim. Andrew says women shouldn't vote. Where? Proof. Proof. Want the proof, Natty?
(13:28) Where is the proof, Natty? Well, Natty's proof is she made it the [ __ ] up. My actual vote on suffrage is that we
(13:35) should move back uh to the terms where almost nobody could vote. It has nothing to do specifically with women at all.
(13:42) Nothing. Zero. Nothing to do with it. And in fact, if you enforce my system, women would probably be able to vote
(13:48) because it would be stakeholder democracy. Natty makes [ __ ] up in her [ __ ] brain, right? Can't ever
(13:55) demonstrate it because she made it the [ __ ] up. Just like she made all this up with Peter Wright. Now, luckily for you,
(14:02) Natty, while I note that you could not show any proof of your claims of this connection, I did bring the receipts. So
(14:11) now I can show them to you publicly and prove that you're a conspiracy [ __ ]
(14:16) theorist. Wacko. Now, if you'll humor me, I will happily pull all of these receipts up. If you'll yield your next
(14:23) two minutes to me, I'll pull the receipts up and we can go over them, Natty, right now live and we can finally
(14:29) put to rest your [ __ ] insane allegations. Can we do that or not, Natty? Are you actually here for the
(14:34) truth or are you just here to show zero proof of any claims? Or do you actually want to go through the evidence because
(14:41) if you do, I came loaded with receipts today. I give you an option, Natty, if you want
(14:47) to yield over. You don't have to. I think Andrew needs to answer my
(14:53) question and and smoke his [ __ ] a bit stronger. Just put it in your mouth, mate. Come on. You know it's in your
(14:58) hand. It's going to burn out if you keep doing that. You need a little bit more nicotine, bro. Yeah. So
(15:08) oh my goodness, these people, they can't think of actually any good arguments in and against Andrew. So they always got
(15:14) to bring up the smoking. It's the best they got. This is what I think Andrew really should be talking about. This is
(15:20) a really good teaching by Orthodox theologian called Dr. Petisus. He's on X
(15:25) as city is liturgy if anyone wants to follow him. Um and this is taken from his book the ethics of beauty. He talks
(15:32) about how the sexes are have a mutualism between them and it actually reflects
(15:37) how orthodox views the trinity. When uh Andrew and some of the other guys in his
(15:42) circle start going start having a little jerk off about um the monarchal position of the father there sometimes that gets
(15:49) a little bit misrepresented because in orthodoxy all three persons of the trinity are co-equal in status. Okay. So
(15:56) they can't exist without each other clearly because they're at the beginning and they'll be there at the end. But at
(16:01) the same time they have a different role, a different order. Yeah. So um the
(16:06) way that Dr. Batis does this he talks about how we have to be Christlike as men and women. We need to be the
(16:12) prophet, the priest and the king like how Christ was in the New Testament. Good to see you. And he says that women have the primary
(16:18) office of the prophet and men have the primary office of the king and they are to achieve that in a priestly manner.
(16:24) When Andrew starts talking about gender roles and how men and women should be, he uses a fundamentalist Protestant
(16:30) framework that some of his like clergy buddies that are unfortunately engaging
(16:35) in the Protestantism of Orthodoxy online like Father Trenum and Father Moses
(16:40) McFersonson, Andrew actually repeats the talking points in the same framework as
(16:46) they do. Um, uh, Father Moses McFersonson says a rather heretical line where he says that Eve ate the apple
(16:52) because she wanted to dominate her husband in the in the video where he talks about why modern marriage failed
(16:59) and he attributes that to St. Isaac the Syrian. Now, I'm wondering if Andrew Wilson agrees with that because that's
(17:05) backwards theologically. Okay. I mean, uh, if you'd like, I can
(17:10) bring Father McFersonson on this panel right this second and you can say that to his face.
(17:16) Would you like to have the clergy on here so that you can discuss this with him? Go ahead. Bring it on.
(17:21) Okay, I'll I'll reach out to him right this second. Uh, Sarah, over in your DMs, I sent you a couple of messages.
(17:27) Can you start with I get to bring someone else on as well? Can you start? Why? I don't understand. You're making the accusation.
(17:33) Yeah. Why? What is the point? He's offering to bring him on because you made a claim about him. Well, why are
(17:39) you bringing someone on? What is this? What? Can you phone a friend? What is thisation against these people?
(17:46) You're making the accusations. Why? Why do you need You want me to be against two people and we need to make
(17:51) Well, it's You're not against two people. I wouldn't even say a word. But anyway, for a second I need to If you can bring up the evidences, that
(17:58) would be great. Smoke your cigarette, Andrew. I'm going to bear with me. And I'm going to
(18:03) completely eviscerate you right this second using the thing that you refuse to bring to this debate.
(18:09) Proof and evidence of any of your claims, but I'm about to give you proof and evidence of mine. Incontrovertible
(18:17) proof. What? Stand by for just a second. Uh, you caught me a little off guard. I have to
(18:23) be able to pull this up without showing all of my other [ __ ] So, just bear with me a moment. I have to be able to drop.
(18:30) Hold on. You two could just
(18:35) What is he talking about? Proof of what? What is he talking about? Proof of what?
(18:40) What is it? Okay. All right. Let's see here. Can you read this for me?
(18:46) No, I think you should read it. And I think you should do it in uh a natty voice. Go on. Try and be like me.
(18:52) What the hell? This woman is nuts. Not only does she want him to read it, but she wants them to do it in her voice.
(18:58) Man, this woman is wacko. Oh, okay. Well, here, let me um actually, this
(19:03) isn't even the beginning of the series. Let me uh let me pull up the correct beginning one here. Oh, there we go.
(19:09) Okay. [Music]
(19:16) Do you believe that Eve ate the apple because she wanted to Hold on. That's we I'm I am totally okay
(19:21) with enjoying the silent that um that everybody could see. Uh
(19:26) just these are just three DMs and we we'll try to go through them as quickly as we possibly can here guys. So
(19:31) uh that is from Peter Wright and he says, "I just heard some ridiculous spaces where Andrew's detractors were
(19:38) talking [ __ ] and he was answering." Hi Peter, that natty chick came in. that Natty
(19:43) Chick came in and claimed you and I had a Patreon conversation and that it was proof we were in cahoots.
(19:49) We both know that's [ __ ] But more to the point, I can't remember ever talking with you on a Patreon. I never
(19:55) visit Patreon. Do you have any recollection of that? So he wants So this guy actually wants to make sure
(20:02) like, am I crazy? Am I crazy or did this just like never happen? and he says,
(20:08) quote, "Unless my memory is failing, it's completely fabricated. Really can't stand that bitch." Now, uh, he continues
(20:16) from there. So, we'll stop that one and I'll I'll move on to uh evidence here.
(20:23) One second.
(20:29) [Music]
(20:36) Hey, Dean. Who the hell is this? How you doing?
(20:41) Who the hell's Dean? Ah, it's Dean Withers. Haha. Special appearance. Kidding
(20:47) again. I I have no idea who any of these people are. He wants He wants more. He wants more
(20:53) another another claim from another person with proof. Let's see if we can get one. Okay, let's let's enjoy the silence.
(21:00) Oh my gosh, lady. This isn't freaking Who wants to be a millionaire? He could just phone friends. The only reason
(21:06) Andrew is doing it is because you made a claim about this other person and you're basing your whole argument around this whole like this claim. Keep bringing up
(21:14) this Peter Wright person and such. Why the hell you bringing out this Dean person?
(21:19) Pulling up the next uh DM, please. Yeah. Yeah. So, here's the actually this is the the last one that's necessary
(21:25) here. Okay, there it is. And
(21:34) It simply says this. Let me minimize here and I'll move back
(21:39) to the screen. Simply says, "It's funny you should say
(21:45) that." This is Rachel's response because I don't remember having any exchange on
(21:50) your Patreon either. I also went to the space where she claims Dean provided proof of that and I didn't see it
(21:56) anywhere. Dean anywhere. She just lies. She's so obsessive. Also, my book was published
(22:03) in 2021, and I don't think you and I interacted whatsoever until at least a couple of years after that, Natty. So,
(22:11) it's hard for me to understand how you could have mentioned me and told me what
(22:16) to write, lol. So, Natty, this is really [ __ ] weird, Natty. So, what I just gave you was I
(22:24) just gave you Why are you on the phone during a live debate, Natty? Why are you on the phone?
(22:29) Listen, I'm listening. You want me to give some more? Can you respond? Can you respond to the evidences that I
(22:36) You haven't finished, have you? So, can can you respond? Natty, can you respond now to the two evidences that I
(22:42) just What is this chick doing? Uh, Natty, I'm going to ask you very politely to take this a little more
(22:49) seriously. I understand that maybe sometimes when we get pinned in a corner, we don't like what we're
(22:55) hearing, we get a little antsy and we start doing uh awkward things again.
(23:00) Yeah. But anyway, can you actually respond person doing awkward things here? Can you respond to That's great. I love that. And we just
(23:06) we start doing awkward things, you know, just uh it's Sarah's very
(23:12) polite and nice way of saying uh Natty, you're starting to crash out and we need you to stop those th those. So, that was proof from
(23:19) Peter Wright uh that not only are your claims completely uh fictitious on the
(23:24) Patreon, which you've shown no proof for, but that the time sequence for Rachel's book wouldn't have even added
(23:29) up between that and their interactions. Now, I'm willing right now to give you the floor. You can take all the same time I just did to pull up the proof.
(23:37) Can you please show us your evidences to the contrary? Dean, can you speak?
(23:42) Um, well, I don't I I don't quite understand. Uh,
(23:48) okay. Hold on. Uh, lady, I don't even know who you are. Why are you calling this number?
(23:54) Just a second. Stop. Stop. Stop. Can you I'm gonna ask you very kindly. I
(24:00) don't know who that is on your end of the line, but they I don't care. Sarah, let it go.
(24:05) What was given to anybody? No worries, Dean. I'm sorry to do this to you last minute, but um
(24:12) I'm not even Wright who was talking to Andrew. I'm doing a live debate with Andrew right now. I'm being told by he
(24:20) has a a DM a screenshot of a DM with Peter Wright who claims that he's never had a conversation with Rachel Wilson
(24:26) even though Rachel Wilson actually No, that's not what what did the what did the DM actually say, Natty?
(24:32) Andrew, have another drag of your cigarette, bro. Um, so, um, I said he asked me to produce a little bit more of
(24:38) a receipt. So, what I'm doing is asking you to say what you told us in the interview on X and then I'll and then
(24:44) you can get back to doing whatever you're doing. Thank you very much. Well, do remember that Peter Wright is
(24:49) is a as a master gaslighter and of picking out screenshots out of
(24:54) We're just looking for the receipts, dude. Narratives for himself. He's one of the most dishonest slime balls I ever met in
(25:00) the men's movement. Now, I saw him posted on one of her forums. That's what I actually said. It says I'm wrong.
(25:06) That's fine. He's one of the most dishonest, hateful, and slanderous individ,
(25:16) by the way, he slandered multiple times. Um, I I'm not even a Christian anymore,
(25:21) but I was always a liberal one. And he just is I don't care about Peter Wright. Can you
(25:28) just give me the proof? Is one of his allies is badgering the witness and has not given proper proper
(25:35) uh proper badgering the witness. This isn't the court of law, dude. Preparation.
(25:42) I just want the receipts, dude. That's all I'm asking for. Somebody associated with the slander artist and the professional gaslighter
(25:49) that is Peter Wright. I I would walk away, sir. I'm out now. Call me sometime if you want.
(25:55) I don't care about Peter Wright. Just show me the receipts of any of these this. That's all I'm asking for.
(26:00) So Dean Esme by the way is somebody who was a well-known men's rights activist
(26:06) who edited Peter Wright's work and then he said to Peter Wright because he was a Roman Catholic at the time and he said
(26:12) listen Peter your writings about the Theotocos where you tried to claim that women had the archetype of the Virgin
(26:17) Mary the Theocos and men had the archetype of Christ is incorrect and I as much as I want to support your work
(26:24) in the men's rights movement I cannot put my name to this. Then he got slandered by a voice for men and
(26:29) honeybadger radio and other individuals and they all called him a crazy Christian fundamentalist even though he
(26:35) was a Vatican 2 supporting Catholic. He was the one who came to me and said that
(26:41) Rachel was having conversations with Peter Wright on her Patreon and he also
(26:46) came and did an interview with me on X and Rachel has admitted this herself. She's spoken about gyosis theory in her
(26:52) book even some tweets I can put in the chat now. Everything is so gyocentric now that simply being direct or strong
(26:59) language is now considered narcissistic and abusive. People are deeply programmed to never make women uh feel
(27:05) uncomfortable or else they risk total personal destruction. That's one tweet. Let's read another one. Um hang on a
(27:11) minute. Let's get the other one. Uh where's it gone? Oh, according to our
(27:16) gyocentric inverted society, women serving their husband is abuse, but also husband not serving a wife is abuse.
(27:22) Make it make sense. Uh, let me do another one. [Music]
(27:28) This clip has made so many women angry. It's satire, but it proves the red pill folks right when they say that even in
(27:34) Christian circles, everything is so gunnocentric that men are not allowed to have preferences. Only women are. What an uncchristian about preferring company
(27:41) of men. Uh, let's read another one. And I can put all the links in the chat. No problem. Just give me a second.
(27:47) What is this? Um, I keep saying that I don't hate women, but I will say this. I have a disdain for the kind of women in our
(27:53) feminist gyocentric society tends to produce now utterly incapable of self-reflection allergic to criticism.
(27:59) Black holes who need endless validation. Yes, I find those women reprehensible
(28:04) and they should be ad admonished. We should socially shame these traits straight out of women. Oh, that sounds
(28:10) Christian. Anyway, luckily I'm delighted to know many women who are not this way. But the women who are this way are
(28:15) always going to hate me and I'm not going to have any concern for them. Cry. Anyway, uh would you like me to go on or
(28:22) do you disagree with your wife about those views? Because as far as I'm concerned, the talking points you bring up in your debates when you talk about
(28:29) gender roles pretty much are in line with hers. So, okay. So, tell us what your definition
(28:36) theory is. Yes. Still waiting. Okay. I'm going to start back with the timer again now that we've got the proof
(28:43) out of the way. You're welcome. Yeah. So, I I let Natty go through whatever Little Spurfest there was, but
(28:50) I want you to note something here that's very important. What I just brought up was was actual evidence, receipts. I
(28:57) brought up receipts which disproved this narrative from Natty that uh there was some type of um I don't know collusion
(29:04) between Rachel when she wrote her book. Remember Nattie made this claim just mere moments ago that Rachel's book
(29:11) because and by the way there's no gyocentrism chapter I'm aware of in the book but she says apparently that the
(29:17) book mentions this somewhere and is talking and discussing this and that these ideas came from this guy Peter
(29:23) Wright but we just established a timeline where that can't be possible and it was from Peter Wright's own mouth
(29:29) and Rachel's where they both claimed that this never happened. And the only one who claims that it happened is
(29:35) [ __ ] Natty. And the only one who can't show proof is Natty. The only one
(29:40) who can't show proof of any of this collusion is Natty. Same thing when it comes to this uh crazy ass idea that she
(29:49) says that there was some type of Patreon link. Okay, I'm willing to grant that there could have been. Show us the proof. Show
(29:56) us the evidence. Just show us the [ __ ] proof. If not, all you have to do is this. And this is why Never Learns
(30:02) Natty, you'll never get it, right? Never learns Natty right now could completely stomp all over me. All she would have to
(30:09) do is show the proof that that Rachel and Peter Wright are lying by showing
(30:15) some sort of messaging between uh her and Peter Wright, showing that they
(30:20) colluded both on her book or that they ever even had contact on the Patreon or that they knew each other or associated
(30:27) ever. That's all she'd have to show. Why is that so difficult for her to show? And why is it so difficult for her to
(30:33) back down the claim? Why can't she just say, "You know what, Andrew? I was wrong. I was totally wrong." And I made all of
(30:39) that up because I wanted there to be a link that there wasn't. All she has to do is that. Why won't she do it? Asking
(30:45) her to admit she was wrong. Oh, yeah. No, that ain't going to happen. Uh, you know, never learns natty. No
(30:52) accountability natty. It ain't going to happen. Once they they once they double down, then they triple down, quadruple
(30:58) down. They can't just take L's, these people. They just can't take L's.
(31:05) Natty, are you calling Dean Esme a liar? Dean Esme, one of
(31:11) the guy who was on the phone who you've completely ignored where you said I didn't show any. Yes. Would you like to say that somebody's
(31:18) Yes. He's a [ __ ] liar. Show me the proof. And how do you know he's on? Because he has no proof. And I do. You
(31:25) don't have proof because I just showed it. Where's yours? I'm waiting. You haven't shown proof at all, dude.
(31:30) Uh, what were the messages that I just showed? You read out four tweets by Rachel that
(31:35) all talk about her use of gyosis. So, what doesn't mean it means the same thing. Yeah, you do actually agree with her.
(31:41) She quote tweeted. So, what it doesn't mean that that's what Peter Wright means by are the same. All you're doing is deflecting.
(31:47) No, you're deflecting. Show us the proof. You're deflecting. Show us your proof that Rachel's version of
(31:55) like to step in and say whether or not my proof is good enough. Listen, Natty, release the Wilson files,
(32:01) Natty. If you got them, unless they're sitting on your desk waiting to be reviewed, unless there's truck uh a
(32:07) truck full of Wilson files, then release them. Yeah. Okay. Yes. Okay. Here's the proof
(32:14) I'm looking for. Seems to be making yourself the arbiter. Here's the proof I'm looking for. One of one of the interesting things about
(32:20) debate is that we don't have to use proof. If we can pardon just a moment
(32:29) for a moment, pardon me apologize. If you could stop talking for just a
(32:34) moment, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thank you. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. These lefties, man, they
(32:41) don't learn and they're freaking wacko. you know, at least Andrew is sitting, you know, he's showing the receipts and
(32:46) stuff and she's got nothing other than just Dean Esma, whoever that dude is, his word of mouth. It's just his word
(32:53) against Andrew's proof. And um like I said, they just don't know how to take
(32:58) L's. They don't know when to admit they're wrong. They're so uh uh they have this, you know, Smoky Man bad
(33:04) syndrome, you know, uh Andrew derangement syndrome. And uh it it it cl
(33:10) it clouds their uh their brain and their rational thinking. Uh this was actually very entertaining to watch. Uh I'm
(33:18) probably going to watch it on my own the rest of it just because it's it's great seeing this woman get wreck erect. She's
(33:24) an absolute lunatic and these lefties they just don't know how to take the road. They don't know how to admit when they're wrong. But what did you guys
