(4:01) welcome back Desiree back by popular
(4:06) demand uh so you came on the show previously and had a quite an
(4:14) interesting exchange and you had some
(4:19) criticisms of the show and we always like to hear people's specific
() 
(4:25) criticisms and their viewpoints so just wanted to hear out I guess what your CRI isms
(4:31) were it's boring okay so can you scoot into the table a little bit and then just get a
(4:36) little closer to the mic so uh okay so the the show is boring well those weren't the criticisms that you
(4:44) outlined uh previously so
(4:52) well we live in a particular found that was very very
(5:00) dated on basically opinions and thought processes that I had I I literally
(5:05) thought that it was dead like 20 years ago and I was very triggered because I
(5:11) came on the show and it felt like I walked through a portal back to like literally age 13
(5:21) being at like you know Church indoctrination Camp basically
(5:27) and I've spent so long I thought healing myself from that
(5:35) ideology and I guess I came on the show and I was
(5:42) honestly shocked that there was still pockets of society that were
(5:47) perpetuating the ideologies that I discovered you promoting to very young
(5:53) impressionable Minds so gu What ideologies
(6:00) um basically colonialism white supremacy um woman
(6:08) hating just basically the mother wound I could really feel the mother wound
(6:14) unhealed from you guys being I could understand that the show
(6:20) was all about basically you unleashing your mother wound onto any female that
(6:27) had the compens compensatory father wound that would match that so A trauma
(6:34) Bond essentially so I found that the show created an environment
(6:41) whereby females Almost 100% are being invited to
(6:47) ESS I'm sorry we have to pause momentarily what's wrong with the the audio is buffering in and
(6:54) out I just watched one on the stream and it's getting it's like in and out
(7:00) [Music] H this could be related this could be related to the stop and start of the
(7:06) recording that I'm
(7:12) possibly I'm sorry guys we're having audio issues um people are saying it's
(7:18) good I feel like trying to listen to it on a cell phone is not the way to troubleshoot this
(7:25) okay yeah white supremacy yeah what was
(7:30) was anything even race talked about in that entire show well you have to
(7:35) understand when it comes to ancestrial or generational trauma that I was responding to it has nothing to do with
(7:43) the external appearance of things it's an energetics so when I say white supremacy I'm referring to the
() 
(7:50) energetics of there being basically a higher Archy of worthiness given to
(7:56) humanity that's just frankly faulty so I do believe that there is a hierarchy of
(8:03) calling for Humanity meaning we're not all gifted with the same intelligence or
(8:08) obviously not everybody is made to be a thought leader or a scientist or things
(8:14) like that that require a higher level of access to Consciousness but I do believe
(8:20) that we all have an inherent equal worthiness before Creator and I believe
(8:25) that those of us who are leaders are called to lead well the class of people
(8:31) who are not intellectually capable of seeing from a big enough perspective to
(8:36) lead themselves hence why we started out having like a president or a government
(8:42) or things like that hang on let's back up a little bit um do you do you agree
(8:47) that white is a horis is what it's a horis I don't know what that word means it's like a descriptor for a set of
(8:54) traits characteristics that you're looking at that like it's an identifier for that right so I believe that it
(9:00) started out being an identifier s i mean it is right this second like if a cop gets on and he says white male suspect
(9:06) and he's running southbound yes it's a it's it is a facade it's a mask that people we that's just a horis well it's
(9:12) easily changed though yeah that's that's cuz it's a horis so if it's a hortic right so it's so what I'm saying hang on
(9:18) hang on hang on let's back up let's back up so so when you say white supremacist
(9:25) views right energetics entics okay but but hang on what comes to my mind is
(9:32) this horis which is associating people with these characteristics who think they're Superior to people who have the
(9:38) same set of characteristics but they're different they're a different color so the problem is for example we had the black gal on here and I would say that
(9:45) she has she grew up white so essentially you can tell from her wounding and her
(9:50) trauma responding and how she was trying to please you and everything that she was saying you could tell that she was
(9:56) raised even though her skin was black she was raised with the ideology that white man is correct so she took on all
(10:04) the colonialism the judeo-christian um indoctrination and the basically
(10:09) subordination of women in that um there is literally no possible way for you to
(10:15) know based on the few conversations you had with this chick who was sitting here that she's conceding to what's being
(10:22) said not because she disagrees with it but because she has been conditioned to believe that everything that I say is
(10:28) true I'm actually I'm actually a very expert Savant psychological profiler so I'm telling you I can
(10:36) tell okay well okay I am a savant psychological profiler so I'm telling
(10:42) you I can tell that she wasn't okay fine agreed to disagree does I mean does that
(10:47) does that seem like it's a even a reasonable argument to make yeah to me it does because I know my exact training
(10:53) and my expertise and I am telling you I have studied humans enough and their psyche to know what was presenting so
(10:59) the white supremacist stuff that you heard on the program was you just made it up no it wasn't so what so what
() 
(11:06) actually appealed to any type of whiteness being grouped or categorized
(11:11) as being Superior to some other ethnicity or or something like this can you give me a single example of that now
(11:18) I don't want to hear about energetics and the perception of things which we're not talking about I want to hear about
(11:23) things we are talking about okay so you don't actually want to understand me you actually want to misunderstand because
(11:28) because and this is important when we're having a conversation if I use a word and then you use a word but we're using
(11:36) the word completely differently then we're not having a conversation exactly so so let's agree on what white means
(11:41) well we can change the word if white doesn't resonate with you well you said white supremacist so I want to know what you mean by white use colonization no I
(11:47) want to use the word white what do you mean by white I mean an ideology and
(11:53) okay an ideology so you don't mean a skin color no okay so in this ideology
(11:59) it does that require superiority yes okay so it requires superiority so now
(12:05) that we've established that this is an ideology and it requires superiority what makes it white because
(12:14) tons of ideologies require superiority so what way makes it specifically in that white category
(12:20) versus I don't know uh Black Liberation theology or something like this because
(12:26) I see that ideology particularly running through so strongly maybe Hitler
(12:32) started it maybe that was where it started but there is a ideology that's
(12:37) running consistent throughout all the different cultures that either you are white or you need to get white in order
(12:45) to have the highest value in the world right now yeah but again you haven't
(12:51) actually identified what makes it white what makes it white I am using white
(12:57) symbolically I am using as a symbol IDE then why isn't it black
(13:03) why why would it why wouldn't you say black supremacist ideology I didn't make the rules I'm just giving but if I say
(13:09) to you uh this thing that I'm talking about I'm talking about an ideology and
(13:14) that this ideology believes it's Superior to another ideology and therefore other ideologies are inferior
(13:20) to it I can agree with that but I do need to know why this distinct word white is being used there why do you
(13:27) need to know that Andrew well because you made the claim that it's white supremacy you didn't say ideological
(13:33) Supremacy you can pick a different word I did Black Supremacy so you want to replace white with black I mean would
(13:39) that would we be saying the same thing yeah I I believe we would because then this woman was then propagating black
(13:45) Supremacy then if you want to use from your worldview I am talking about the
(13:51) ideology that there could be a best way to human yeah but you could Advocate that
(13:58) there's the best way to human without saying that that necessarily makes one human Superior to
(14:05) another I agree so I agree but I don't believe that we have a population right
(14:11) now that has the intellect to even go that deep into the understanding of what an ideology is but when you use surface
(14:18) level so this is what confuses me when you use loaded language like you understand that politically white supremacy has a completely different has
(14:26) because you and you just said right when when you're talking about people uh word x resonates with people and hits
(14:31) with them differently yeah so if you're using the loaded language of white supremacy why am I not to assume that if you don't actually mean white supremacy
(14:38) that you're saying that for the purposes of just kind of attacking the show rather than using it for the purpose of
(14:43) actually trying to express an idea it feels to me that I'm trying to
(14:49) express my idea but that you have a particular agenda of not understanding what I'm saying and so it's kind of a
(14:56) dead end let's go to the next topic well well you can understand from my perspective if I came over and I was
(15:01) like hey um you know the big the big problem that I have is that um you know
(15:09) you have plants in front of your house I'm not listening to anything you're saying after I push this button so we can move to the next topic because it's
(15:14) a dead end we we did move to a different topic okay you were still talking about it I'm
(15:20) talking about ideologies so the topic now is ideologies how can we even have a conversation if we weren't talking about
(15:26) ideologies well I thought you were still on specifically the word white well no I'm just trying to get your thought
() 
(15:32) pattern down so would it be helpful to you maybe we can back up sure would it be helpful to you um if we defined our
(15:41) our ideologies why we think the way that we think and where it is that we're coming from yes would that be helpful
(15:48) yes I think so okay well let's start with yours and then I'll do mine it would actually be better for you
(15:54) to go first so I know what you're looking for okay so to explain to you my
(16:01) worldview and it's it it's a there's a bit of complication but I'm going to try to get it really condensed so that um so
(16:08) that you can understand where I'm coming from so I'm an Eastern Orthodox Christian Eastern can you explain that
(16:14) yeah I'm about to yep I'm about to explain what that means so there's many types of Christians you would say but
(16:22) there are some kind of universal agreements among what are considered trinitarian Christians okay so this
(16:28) would include so the descript I'm about to give you is going to include uh
(16:36) Protestants it's going to include Protestants it's going to include Catholics right it it's it's going to
(16:43) include Eastern Orthodox just a second Brian where do you want it it's placed do you want it right
(16:50) there yeah let them finish okay but you're very bothered and then that bothers me so I want you to feel comfortable what's the issue you're
(16:56) having it's it's placed it's all fine okay all right we're all good um okay so
(17:02) I'm going to try to give a a kind of encompassing ideology here for uh the the Christian worldview the Christian
(17:09) worldview how I see it and I think that the descriptor that I'm going to give is going to so I have a question for you
(17:15) before I get to the ideology before I can even tell you the ideology are we having before I can tell you my ideology
(17:20) you have a question about it before I've even asked okay what's the question are we
(17:26) having are you trying to promote that your ideology is superior to mine no I'm
(17:32) just trying to explain what it is but then why is it a debate because you can have your belief and I can have
(17:38) my belief and it's apples and oranges I don't see the point so do you want to have a conversation conversation with
() 
(17:44) somebody and you don't even know what the worldview is well I'm saying if it's a debate and
(17:49) we don't share the same worldview what's the point because well that that would be the point World Views
(17:56) so debates are about World Views debates are about not only worldviews but they're about paradigms so I have a
(18:04) paradigm in a way set way that I look at the world so do you right there's no way to avoid this it doesn't matter who you
(18:10) are there's going to be a paradigm in which you view the world so what we can do is we can utilize the Paradigm in the
(18:15) worldview and that'll relay a shitload of information to you immediately about all the things that I would believe
(18:22) across a large spectrum of things right you know what I mean right but then what I'm saying is if I I am let's say I
(18:30) don't know if I am but let's say I'm diabolically opposed to that yeah let's say for example I'm a Satan worshipper
(18:37) and you're a Christian yeah okay and we are trying to debate so I'm just trying
(18:43) to understand what the point of all this is do you think the debate about agreeing with worldviews yeah maybe
(18:48) that's what I thought as a woman because I'm basically groomed to have to agree with the males in leadership otherwise
(18:56) it gets to be a very toxic environment for me if you were a Satanist and you were debating with a Christian you would
(19:01) have different Express worldviews and then you would debate the incoherency or the problems or the non problems with
(19:08) these worldviews they don't always have to be opposing necessarily there could be uh points of a debate okay you're
(19:15) looking for agreement is it like we're and honestly this is not me trying to be difficult I don't live in a man's world
(19:21) I I literally am like basically a stay-at-home mom this is just the world okay I get it but I've been like
(19:27) sheltered I guess you could say so I'm trying to learn
(19:32) honestly I think what you're inviting me to do is kind of invoke my masculine
(19:38) energy and come to the table with you and basically poke holes at your ideology and you poke holes at mine and
(19:45) then we kind of see where in the VIN diagram we might be opposition we could find tons of agreement and not be poking
(19:52) holes in anybody's ideology or we could be looking at Concepts exactly the same way but expressing them differently I
(19:58) don't know any of that until I understand what your worldview is and you understand what mine is you can leave it on the table if you want deser
(20:04) you can just leave it in as a psychologist though I don't know how you would say it's feminine or masculine energy though because you're a
(20:09) psychologist you're the entirety of what you do is understanding worldviews true so I do have that part of me that that's
(20:16) what I'm trying to get at is are you trying to talk to Desiree the the woman
(20:21) who basically goes around and feels what Everything feels like or are you trying
(20:27) to invoke my scientist philosophical so from a philosophical angle if we were to
(20:33) take you Desiree take Gore Gracie donated
(20:39) $100 making the word human a verb changing the subject when you run out of talking points not off to the greatest
(20:47) start BTW when you make everything about race it kind of makes you a racist
(20:54) smile thank you Gracie I appreciate it yeah appreciate it um yes so where we oh
(20:59) yeah yeah so when we're talking about um we're talking about worldviews from from a psychologist
(21:07) angle don't you need to know why people believe the things that they believe well the thing is as I tried to
(21:13) explain to you that I am a really expert psychological profiler so I don't need
(21:18) to have a lot of back and forth with people to understand enough about their
(21:24) ideology to know the program that they're spitting back at me so that's why it's to me to my brain you have to
(21:32) understand it feels like a waste of my time because even though you haven't verbally expressed your ideology I can
(21:38) tell what it is by the way that you try to trigger me so for examp I try to
(21:44) trigger you well
(21:49) um honestly I don't think you want my brain to start unraveling that whole explanation because it could go on for a
(21:56) really long time in like I've just asked you a couple of questions right but in
(22:02) fact I I so I'm not even in debate mode right now I'm just trying to figure out so from the way I think of it if I take
(22:09) your brain I take it out and I put it inside of a computer you're not you anymore you've now become something else
(22:14) you are you with you're all maybe all of those thoughts that you had are there but you're not you right so you the
(22:21) encompassment of what is desire is going to be body mind soul everything right the entirety of you and the ideology
(22:28) which fits you that's what ontologically is Desert it's what makes you you and not her right so if I took your brain
(22:34) and put it in Madison you're still not you you're now you're something else that's not you I would disagree with that because I
(22:42) that's why I need your ideology okay okay so my ideology is that there is a universal Consciousness a universal
(22:49) intelligence we can call that God we can call that astrology we can call that life we can call it whatever is beating
(22:55) your heart you didn't create yourself so whatever it is that you believe created
(23:01) cial donated $100 it seems as though you are the one who has been indoctrinated to believe
(23:07) that you don't have a voice might it be the feminist ideals that make you feel this way desire you are all of your
(23:18) brain thank you killer of seral um so you said you were on universal intelligence when you say
(23:24) Universal intelligence I've actually heard this reference before um ol logically as the ID or sometimes the
(23:31) super ego or sometimes things like this are you referring to those types no no
(23:36) I'm I'm referring to literally the vibrational information that has been passed down from the beginning of time
(23:43) so really SC if you want to go into the science of it it's actually passed down by the spores so if you study um hang
(23:51) before we get into the particulars right I'm just looking for the
(23:57) universals so like just to be honest with you to be honest with you I don't have a
(24:02) basic ideology and contrary to popular belief I wasn't indoctrinated by anything but literally observing things
(24:09) for myself and digging into my own psyche so I can't be put into a box and
(24:16) that's why it gets well I there's no way no matter how you would
(24:21) describe uh you know what you ideologically believe there would be no
(24:27) way perhaps if if I gave you an infinite amount of time to describe it for us to ever get the full scope and picture
(24:32) right that would be impossible but we can get we can get an idea
(24:37) right what's the spores about okay so um the spores you know fungi yeast um
() 
(24:45) bacteria anything that basically is free floating and is creating um what we
(24:51) would call mushrooms you would call it mushrooms or spores in the tiny tiny version okay so they actually carry the
(24:59) um the information of all the Earth and they are free floating in the air so literally there's a there is a Netflix
(25:07) documentary on it right now if you're interested in digging into the science of it but a savant basically his calling
(25:13) his obsessions were spores so watch that documentary and you can go deep into
(25:18) literally this is the scientific explanation of how the Earth or Universal Consciousness is speaking to
(25:25) all of us and the spores um scientist are discovering were actually the first
(25:31) particles that can be documented or shown to probably have
(25:39) have led to life so that's that is a nerdy scientific um explanation these um
(25:47) do these spores do they exist in all
(25:52) environments what do you mean by all environment do they exist in the ocean yes yes do they exist in Aid Desert land
(25:59) yes okay how do they survive in all of the multitud that's what the miracle is of it you should really watch that
(26:05) documentary I really recommend it it's called um Fantastical fungi brilliant brilliant research that they are there
(26:11) any areas of the world where the there aren't the spores no they're everywhere yes and they can withstand even lava yes
(26:18) that's what's the miracle of it yes Watch the documentary it's incredible like nuclear bombs can they well
(26:24) obviously because do they exist in space Chernobyl I don't well this man is not an
(26:31) astronaut so I don't think he has access to what they've discovered in space but only you know the people who know what
(26:38) we've collected from Mars and things like that could tell you that's not public information yet so I don't know
(26:43) okay how how big are the spores I don't I don't know obviously a Spore is very
(26:48) microscopic well it's it's it's all different it starts very microscopic tiny like a cell or an atom but then it
(26:54) can grow all the way oberved they can be observed they're observable what and the smallest is is like uh there are they uh
(27:01) smaller than atoms again this is not my area of expertise I'm giving you the reference of where you could study it
(27:07) yourself if you wanted to go further in it okay yeah and do you do you breathe the the SP yeah you breathe it yeah
(27:12) you're breathing them so when your body system is enough um is pure enough
(27:17) meaning you haven't messed with all your hormones and things with Pharmaceuticals and all of that so like trans people or
(27:24) um it it would depend I don't know I I don't know enough of about the hormone therapies and things that they're giving
(27:30) them I I don't know um enough about that yeah I don't know enough about that they
(27:36) move information yes and so this is why you think that cross-generational information is that's one of the reasons
(27:43) and also vibrationally um trauma especially is being passed down through
(27:48) the generations through those spores no through the mother's womb the wom yeah the wom and then also it's inside the
(27:55) egg and it's inside the why would different cultures be so technologically distinct then if it was a universal
(28:02) because the once that once that baby is born into a culture fungi
(28:09) universals so this is the collective data transfer is through these fungi because you have to understand that the
(28:15) universe and God is very multifaceted so we look at human cultures and we're
(28:21) assuming that every human should be presenting in the same evolutionary tract but that's not true think about
(28:28) the animal kingdom we have all different animals evolving into different levels of species that's going on between
(28:34) humans can you concent can the spores be collected yes can they be concentrated
(28:40) yeah and actually what they're starting to do is find the strands of spores that you mix together that heal like there's
(28:47) like Inda sativa SP that's marijuana I'm talking about I'm talking about fungi
(28:52) spores so more along the lines of of psychedelics magic mushrooms okay what they can do is crop dust right strands
(28:59) of these mixtures of spores and it's literally healing massive issues Have You Seen the Last of Us The Last of Us
(29:06) it's a well it's used to be a video game now it's like an HBO hit series is that
(29:12) with the bunker and it's like a bunker and everybody has to a zombie apocalypse but but the spores once the temperature
(29:19) rises high enough like due to the like the global warming or whatever like the spores can like enter your brain or
(29:25) whatever and like take control of you I've seen it but the spores the spores are already in control of us they're
(29:32) already in control they've always been their award I think it's like Oscar
(29:38) nominated Pablo POS I've never seen it but I'm just telling you watch that documentary because it will explain to
() 
(29:44) you the Deep science of all of this but so you can concentrate the spores like into a concentrate can you like like use
(29:51) it as a drug like shoot it up yeah I mean people do magic mushrooms all the time they're taking plant
(29:58) medicine Journey like is this a drug like could you do it as a drug like would it get you high it depends on what
(30:03) Str of mushroom you're doing do you not know about mushrooms do you not know about psychedelics and psilocybin and all that I I didn't know if it was psych
(30:10) so some um spores have psilocybin and some do not so some would be Psycho
(30:15) reactive and some would not be mhm yeah um I'm I think
(30:22) I've have a pretty thorough understanding of the sport thing now Andrew I didn't mean to interrupt but no
(30:27) worries no I was just um so yeah so anyway so back to uh the idea of ideology or
(30:35) worldview um I don't expect that you'll be able to express the entirety of your worldview over a thousand books or a
(30:42) thousand hours or anything like that um but I do think that humans are pretty capable of condensing the uh kind of
() 
(30:50) cores of their ideas very quickly and that those universals can then quickly
(30:56) even though there's nuan all universals can then quickly be picked up so for instance if somebody says that they're a
(31:01) Libertarian they're relaying with the word libertarian a huge ideology to you
(31:08) uh that you never actually have to dive into because just by that word we know some of the implications of it this
(31:14) problem is Andrew is like I was telling you earlier is what we're having is it's
(31:20) like a giant game of telephone has been going on where we have so
(31:25) propagated political correctness or um submission to social norms that we
(31:33) are losing track of conscious thought of people being born and having their own
(31:39) thoughts about things and so what's happening is we have gone so many generations of basically being abused if
(31:46) I can say that basically being forced by our parents and our culture around us to
(31:52) adhere to a particular thought process otherwise we are literally bullied nearly to death so I you think and you
(32:00) think that's bad right yes okay so so bad thinking things
(32:08) can be bad in and of itself is ideological the force what okay so
(32:13) here's my ideology I guess in a nutshell MH as I'm understanding
(32:20) is at least that thing is really quiet at least at least there's that but anyway go ahead sorry it's that
(32:29) we are no longer letting human beings be
(32:38) born individuals we are indoctrinating them whether we're from one ideology or
(32:46) another it doesn't matter we basically have created an entire world of
(32:52) different Cults where you're born into one and you are basically pigeon hold
(32:58) into either obeying the ideologies or the rules or the social constructs of
(33:05) that Society or you're literally cast out you are cast out and I am one of
(33:10) those ones who have been cast out well now at least I understand I think a little bit about where you're coming from okay so from your angle and your
(33:17) view uh ideologies themselves are entanglements of belief structures which
(33:22) people have not e constructs yeah they have not been accepted and you don't want people to be at the mercy of having
(33:29) to accept them yes because I believe each person being born in and having the
(33:35) freedom to have their own thought process that's the checks and balance system in nature to make sure that not
(33:41) one ideology isn't being unfair to another okay so let's so let's back up
(33:47) then now that at least I understand the core of this can you I'm tribal if that makes is that helps you make sense I
(33:53) identify more with like a Native American or a tribal African culture are
(33:58) are you two no I'm Cherokee and Blackfoot Blackfoot okay yeah like in actuality or identifi do you have
(34:04) membership I don't have membership I don't have enough of the genetics in me to have a well I mean I've honestly
(34:10) never looked into test did you have you Tak I never did the DNA test this is just coming this is coming from you know
(34:15) how your grandmas tell you this is our tribe kind like Elizabeth waren like are you so it's quite it's quite possible
(34:22) I'm not at all I'm just trying to help you understand that I'm not coming from a Christian IDE ology I'm coming from a
(34:28) more tribal ancient type of spirituality more similar to um if if basically using
(34:36) basically being Guided by the astrology with my biological nature system um
(34:44) remaining as pure as possible to the Earth how I was created if we were to order a 23 and me genetic testing would
(34:51) you sub to it yeah actually I I've been wanting to do it but I've been broke so if you want to pay for it sure we'll
(34:58) we'll get it for you so word on the street is I am primarily Native American
(35:03) um Norwegian primarily Native American um that's all I have heard passed down
(35:09) through the family verbiage is I'm German Norwegian and Native American
(35:15) that's all that my family has reported to me now who knows what is really true
(35:21) you know but that is and I can identify with those things I need to let three TT
(35:26) come in I had to UL SE the Pagan donated $100 she's talking about the akashic
(35:33) record pseudo science I think this is in reference to the spores
(35:38) thing I think the spores thing was it a question I record he didn't ask a
(35:44) question was a question he was more of a stat are you aware what the akashic record is two more coming in you would have to remind me exactly what it is
(35:51) it's uh the esoteric idea that there exist all of human knowledge in its
(35:57) entirety in some metaphysical space which can be accessed by all human beings at any time by setting out their
(36:04) conscience and visualizing The Great Library and then they can access what are called the osic
(36:09) records okay I mean I wouldn't put it in those words but I GD One Motorsports
(36:15) donated $100 shockingly I have a degree a real one in Psychology and deser needs some
(36:22) help vibrational information is some new wave bullsh E8
(36:28) yeah I I got mine from UC Irvine mhm and then um I went to grad
() 
(36:35) school too at Cal Baptist in Riverside and I got a degree in um counseling Ministry so I'm actually an ordained
(36:41) counseling Ministry um kilo of cereal donated $100 this is not my area of expertise
(36:50) but goes directly into specifics of how they move through you and how they can be collected have you seen a jar of
(36:56) these Sports before you're positive you sure no I've never seen them I'm just
(37:02) reporting what um the the studies are coming in from the savants which I trust
(37:08) more than researchers who are paid at this point because a savant is somebody who
(37:16) is just genuinely obsessed or passionate about a certain subject they have no
(37:23) nothing political or or monetary to gain by their research so I believe that you
(37:29) really cannot believe everything that you're reading in so-called scientific
(37:35) studies right now it really needs to go further and I believe that citizens
(37:40) citizens who are just genuinely passionate about the subjects need to be factchecking the so-called experts
(37:47) because a lot of of is getting  with if I may at this point
(37:53) really quick going back to your two diplomas here so you have you Irvine you got a degree in psychology and social
(38:00) behavior oh there's another one coming and then um so I was also um I was um I
(38:08) was enlisted in the US Army um back in 2009 I was actually going to be a combat
(38:15) surgeon so I they were trying to FastTrack me to be a combat surgeon because my asbs were so high and I had
(38:22) already received my diploma from UC Irvine so they wanted me to be an officer obviously with my Fab scores and
(38:28) my degree but I actually declined officer status because I did not believe
(38:34) that I don't believe in taking something just because you learned the head knowledge I believe in doing the work to
(38:41) actually gain that respect so I was going to go as a specialist as an E4 um
(38:47) and be a medic start as a medic and then they were going to FasTrack me to be a combat surgeon as soon as I was ready um
(38:54) I actually got pregnant I got pregnant oh go ahead go um this was back in 2009
(39:00) the economy had crashed in 2008 I was a college graduate and all of us were like scrambling around like what are we going
(39:06) to United States Army Future Soldier yes so I never made it because I got pregnant and I actually had to go and
(39:12) get a military discharge before I got shipped off so at that time there was such a wait list to even get in the
(39:18) military that I had to wait four months from when I enlisted to when I was going to get shipped out to um you got you
(39:25) enlisted you were not officer I enlisted I refused to be an officer I was going to first be an E4 specialist and be a
(39:32) combat medic and then I was going to work my way up when I felt that I had deserved the title of officer then I was
(39:39) going to let them bump me up to to combat surgeon can somebody in the chat who has military background educate me
(39:45) if you can go from you said E4 FASTT track to uh combat I would just get
(39:50) bumped up to off starting as an E4 usually you have to have some kind of education yes you don't you would start
(39:56) at E1 if you didn't have a colge degree but then is that a thing that they FastTrack you to combat yeah because
(40:01) they were already they already wanted me to do when it comes to the Army it all depends on the contract yes okay and
(40:07) then so you have UC Irvine and then you have and then California St Baptist went
(40:13) on to to get um certification in a transformational life coaching program
(40:18) with Mary morrisy she's very well known in the brave thinking Institute so this one was actually my most expensive
(40:24) certification this took me two years of extra study 40 ,000 for this um life coaching certification so this taught me
(40:32) metaphysics quantum physics and how to apply it basically into creating anything that you want in life so it was
(40:38) cool because my brain took what I knew of psychology and it took what I knew of
(40:44) Ministry of ministering to people and all of what I knew enough of the world
(40:50) religions it took all that information and basically showed me how long does it
(40:56) take to get a degree in the Arts of counseling Ministry this one was two years this took two years wait can you
(41:02) move that one so the camera can see it no no no that that one from the California Baptist University yeah so
(41:09) this is a four-year degree from UC urbine and I also had a minor in education a two-year yes it's accredit
(41:15) you don't know about Cal Baptist in Riverside it's it's an accredited school yeah look it up so I was one of the first of this pilot program there was
(41:22) only 13 in my class um when we completed this really awesome program great guys
(41:28) down there at Cal Baptist woot woot to um Nathan Lewis shout out was my
(41:33) professor and um Stokes Dr they ordained you as a minister ordination was
(41:38) optional so if we wanted to be ordinate ordained because we were going to go actually um do anything that required
(41:44) ordination we could get that I could still go back and have an official ordination a degree in heresy I mean if
() 
(41:51) you want to call it that well I mean if they're going to or if they're going to ordain female ministers I mean that would be a degree in heresy right that
(41:57) would be heretical heretical to what your ideology well yeah remember I was
(42:02) trying to give you that earlier but you didn't want it so but I wouldn't call it heresy because it's just my worldview
(42:07) heresy means that it goes against so I guess if you want to just agree it goes against your very small-minded Square
(42:13) ideology how do you know if my if my ideology is square and small-minded you didn't even want tell it to because
(42:19) you're so boring I don't want to hear it I heard should I just pattle and cluck like this and absolutely say nothing for over and over and over again Non-Stop
(42:25) and talk about small mushrooms spores and then after we get to the small mushroom spores let's move over really quick into how we can cherry pick the
(42:31) way that different ideologies of the world are all within some type of narrow prism and that way uh you know we can
(42:37) then move into the psychological and ideology Universal intelligence vibrational enf and bad the osic records
(42:43) I mean does that make you feel better if I SP tell how you really feel should I I mean does it make you feel better if I spur we shouldn't use that it's just
() 
(42:51) that you're boring to be honest okay great I I could take over for a little bit yeah go Brian I mean I don't think
(42:56) I'll be any any uh less boring I suppose than Andrew but I did look into you said that
(43:04) there it was a Mary morisy for that program Mory yeah she's a transformational life Co is she affiliated with the new thought
(43:09) organization living Enrichment Center no she runs the brave thing do you know what her middle name is Mary man and
(43:17) morsy that was her maiden name okay man was is her husband Edward
(43:23) I don't know uh Edward right no her husband right now is Joe Dicky her current husband hold on Mary Mary Mory I
(43:31) mean it's possible there's two Mary morsy's that are involved my Mary Mory is down in Orange County and she runs
(43:37) the brave thinking Institute she worked with the dolly llama she has a special on PBS that was she she was working with
(43:44) the dolly Lama for like three different sessions of trying to come up with a plan for world peace with Martin Luther
(43:50) King J family she does a lot with um she worked a lot with Bob Proctor if you know Bob
(43:56) proor that was like her besti he passed away now rest in peace and then she also does a lot of work with Andrew
(44:03) Beckwith and Andrew Beth withth is down in um La he runs a spiritual
() 
(44:10) center okay and that they are more in alignment with my ideology the brave thinking institute
(44:18) bti there's maybe multiple people named Mary morsey who are doing these kind of scams or whatever is it
(44:24) this lady I pull up yeah pull it up please this lady is that her yes that's Mary Marcy okay well I see something for
(44:31) a living Enrichment Center a Wikipedia article that
(44:36) indicates that I don't know if this is the same one but there was a Mary morsy
(44:41) who had one of these centers and it closed in 2004 as a result of a 10 million Financial SC that was her
(44:46) husband her husband was actually embezzling all that money and she actually had nothing to do with it well
(44:53) she she she missed a lot of red flags that he was doing that this and so she shut it down and then she dedicated all
(45:00) these years to repaying back that $10 million so she has repaid that debt and since she paid it off a long time ago
(45:06) and now she got out of running her running her um ministry as a church and
(45:12) she now runs it as a life coaching um program and so you P she was a minister
(45:18) yes what denomination I have no idea no clue she started her own as far as I
(45:24) know yeah well I mean I it seems to indicate here there's a news organization called uh ke it must be
(45:32) when you I just want to I just want to clarify something when he's saying Ministry he's assuming that it's a
(45:37) Christian ideology I'm not talking about Christian Ministry is that where you're getting because I'm feeling some
(45:42) animosity towards you and I'm not understanding why you're being very condescending when I bring up the word
(45:48) ministry well okay you have a degree from a Christian University that doesn't
(45:53) mean I'm a Christian yeah I understand but if a Christian University is going to ordain you for a Ministry they didn't
(45:58) ordain me if that's not what I said I said if a Christian organization is going to ordain you for a Ministry
(46:04) they're going to be ordaining you as a Christian minister but I'm not Mary morsy was not ordained by a Christian
(46:10) organization and nor was I yeah I get it but you could see how I would correlate
(46:15) uh before we were using the word minister in this context Ministry from a Christian context that I could assume
(46:21) that this woman was a Christian minister she was not a Christian minister that's fine if she wasn't but you can when you
(46:27) say Ministry then what does that mean just I tell people somebody who is dedicated to helping people in and they
(46:34) have um they have an accountability that is between them and God so basically
(46:39) they could be satanic ministers yes if if that's their higher power that they are accountable to yes there could be
(46:44) satanic ministers and there is obviously MH yeah well I mean I'm not super interested in this Mary Mory or the
(46:51) program that you were referencing uh does seem to indicate here that as a
(46:57) 2007 there's no more recent reportings but this is on Wikipedia uh news
(47:02) organization reported she only repaid only 74,000 since her plea bargain her
(47:08) plea bargain was struck in 2005 uh in any case I'm not super interested in
(47:13) that but you paid $40,000 for that program well I paid um $115,000 for a
(47:19) year of mentorship with her program so that basically taught me what they call
(47:25) um Brave think skills so basically how to actually bring back critical thought
(47:31) and and um okay how to how to become conscious
(47:36) again of your thoughts she's a she's a life coach right she's a life coach yeah a transformational life coach yeah and
() 
(47:42) you're also a transformational life coach I don't label myself as that no but you are a life coach I don't label
(47:47) myself as that but you said you do life coaching if that's what people need at the time so you do do life coaching
(47:57) what's the point of your question to ask if you do life coaching why are you asking what's your intention to to see
(48:03) if you do life coaching but there's a deeper intention behind that can you explain it yeah I would like to know if
(48:09) you do life coaching why so that I know the answer to the question of if you do live
(48:15) coaching I don't believe that you're being straightforward with your intentions so I'll just say no no you
(48:21) don't do life coaching no okay I don't think that was a gotcha but anyways I do want to move it on uh in your opening
(48:27) statement you mentioned that what you you mentioned there's the colonialism white supremacy we already talked about
() 
(48:33) that you also mentioned the woman hating What specifically did me or Andrew uh
(48:39) say that indicated that we hate women or that we what what was woman hating about
(48:46) the show I didn't feel safe in your presence what does that have okay anything
(48:55) else well I'm I'm almost 40 so I've been a woman for a long time and what I've
(49:01) learned is that when I'm welcome I feel safe and
(49:08) when I'm not I don't okay
(49:13) so is there anything else that me or Andrew said or through our conduct that
(49:19) would indicate that was woman hating I don't think I need to explain
(49:25) why I didn't feel safe uh that's not what I'm asking you I'll even grant that you didn't feel safe that's fine how
(49:32) were we woman hating why don't you tell me well I'd like to ask um do you think
(49:39) that um that people on the TV can jump out of the TV and hurt you grid One Motorsports donated
(49:47) $100 bullsh that is all oh8 get to a church and find God or go to hell
(49:57) yeah do you think people can jump out of a TV screen and do do bad things to you I do because most damage especially done
(50:03) these days is psychological and emotional so so feeling safe from your
(50:08) perspective is not just physical exactly it's emotional safety correct and is it other people's responsibility to make
(50:15) you feel emotionally safe or is it your responsibility I would say it's both
(50:22) okay so it is other people's responsibility to make you feel emotionally safe I say when when there is not full disclosure of
(50:30) the plan of what's going to be done to me psychologically then that is the
(50:36) responsibility of the person who's manipulating me it's really funny that you say that because this actually is
(50:42) just deterring responsibility to the second party right so you're saying yes you guys are more powerful than I am as
(50:49) far as damaging me psychologically because we live in a society that has
(50:54) normalized the manipulation of women and their vulnerability emotionally so I
(51:01) believe that you partook in that same essentially tactic of getting from me
(51:08) what you wanted yeah so so I'm going to just like Grant a couple things right uh
(51:13) thing one I have to go to the bathroom first and then when I come back you can share
()

(53:27) yeah well if you guys were nice I wouldn't need it if if we were nice she
(53:32) wouldn't need we've been nice I think you guys are nice we' been
(53:37) nice pass I would just say exactly what I I I I was just about to tell you
(53:44) exactly what I thought but then you had to pee I did we we're going to I've had a lot of children we we will get in
() 
(53:51) future episodes funnels onto the table for people to so they don't have to so yeah
(53:57) I mean I was just about to to Grant to you uh yeah I don't care about how what
(54:02) I say makes a person emotionally feel if uh the purpose of the discussion is a
(54:09) disagreement how your like your emotional state from there is totally irrelevant to me do you know that that's
(54:16) a a symptom of what
(54:21) psychopathy psychopathy doesn't exist it it does it doesn't it's a lack of
(54:26) empathy for another's feelings okay so you're a psychologist right yes okay do
(54:32) you think that psychopathy is actually a medical psychological condition and that
(54:38) you can identify it in the DSM yes they can now brain scan you and tell if you have psychopy do you have your phone yes
(54:45) okay can you pull up the DSM 5 and show me where it says anything about psychopathy I'm not talking about the
(54:51) dsm5 I'm talking about well then how do you categorize what is a psychological condition you can get a brain scan and your matter would show up differently
(54:57) than somebody without psychopathy that first of all when you're talking about brain scans that's really brand new tech
(55:03) that's the same thing as when people say that you can do a brain scan to determine a gender you really can't because you have human variances in
(55:10) sexuality gender is is determined more by the hormonal makeup matter cannot determine if somebody is a psychopath
(55:16) but even if it could psychopathy in and of itself has not even been demonstrated to be harmful to
(55:22) society psychopathy in and of itself could be a boon to Society for inance instance you may need people who have
(55:28) completely unfeeling dispositions for certain jobs which need
(55:33) doing I agree because we are all tools essentially of the Divine well I mean
(55:40) God you in your ideology you would call it God yeah I would say that we're all we're all definitely
(55:46) in there's where our Vin diagrams are crossing I believe we are all tools but I need to ask it just because I don't
(55:52) care what your emotional state is when we're having a discussion about something we dis agree on I don't
(55:57) understand why that would even indicate psychopathy it's very common for stoic men to not care about the emotional
(56:04) status of a person who refuses toere to it's very common of men to be abusive it doesn't mean it's
(56:09) right yeah but you're now you're conflating two different things so I would agree psychopath Psychopathic
() 
(56:15) individuals are abusive yeah but not all abusive people are psychopaths true
(56:21) that's true some of them are narcissistic yeah but not all abusive people are narcissists some of them are just trauma responding and they over all
(56:28) them are doing that either yeah abuse name name a type of abuse from you is so
(56:33) broad that encompasses everything encompasses emotional the psychological the degradation it's the calculated
(56:41) degradation of another individual without remorse feeling or care it's not
(56:47) a trauma response in other words now what you saw of me in the last show was me trauma responding so I did hurt
(56:54) people's feelings and I said things that were you could say abive you could say
(56:59) abusive but I really was I have very complex traumas mhm I could spend yeah
() 
(57:06) but isn't it a a lot of time telling you but isn't it awful convenient to say when I do it it's excused when you do it
(57:11) it's because you're a psychopath well to be honest with you you're a
(57:18) predator I'm not well you're not a predator no what what makes me predatory
(57:23) and you not predatory I don't go out seeking to hurt people you do who do I
(57:28) go out to seek to hurt me how did I seek to hurt you you are seeking to show the
(57:35) followers that I am basically not worth living not worth speaking not worth
(57:40) breathing not worth having an opinion my opinion well if your opinion is bad then
(57:46) yes that your opinion so look at very condescending try to just toose yourself
(57:51) put yourself in my shoes for a second okay let us assume for a second that I had some knowledge so I was raised by
(57:59) your ti assume for a second well they didn't they didn't raise you right but assume for a second I just diverted to
(58:05) something else okay so anyway back to this real quick I was I was in the middle of talking it's awful abusive of
(58:10) you to cut me off while I'm speaking it I'm speaking I'm just giving you back your own medicine I'm speaking I'm giving you back your own medicine I
(58:16) don't I don't respect you I'm speaking I don't respect you I'm speaking I don't respect your thought process so anyway I
(58:23) literally don't respect your thought proc who cares what you respect who cares what you respect me you why should
(58:28) I care about you if you don't give a  about me I don't give a about you cut we're yes if you don't give a
(58:33) about me I'm going to show you what it feels like to have somebody not give a about you but I'm not going to
(58:38) Gaslight you and pretend like I give a  I'm just going to tell you I don't give a about your there's a difference between I don't give a

(1:07:16) page 71 of your book you say basically all the greats including myself and Jesus with whom you categorize yourself
(1:07:23) with whom I have quite a spicy relationship with now wink wink what did you mean by that because I talk about if
(1:07:31) you actually read my whole book I talk about that one of my reoccurring fantasies can I go there yeah was
(1:07:39) basically something that I had tried to repress my whole time of being a
(1:07:45) Christian was a fantasy of Jesus sitting on the throne and me essentially riding
(1:07:51) him face to face and I was always shaming myself in pushing that fantasy
(1:07:57) away until finally the death of a friend in my arms
(1:08:06) basically me up so bad that everything that I
(1:08:13) thought was true exploded and I finally started allowing
(1:08:19) in every part of me including the dark and the things that I had previous
(1:08:25) iously disowned from myself and shamed I let it come in and what I realized was
(1:08:32) that my sexuality wanted to reintegrate with my spirituality and my spirituality
(1:08:39) at the time because I was coming out of a Christian ideology my spirituality at
(1:08:45) the time was the conceptualization of my creator of my Divinity as being in
(1:08:50) incarnate in Jesus and so what I realized was in allowing that fantasy to
(1:08:55) be alive in my body was that
(1:09:01) I simply wanted Oneness and face to face
(1:09:06) eye to eye contact with the fullness
(1:09:12) of God and so so Jesus Was Your Boyfriend essentially in your head my husband your
(1:09:19) husband yes okay and you wanted to sleep with him yeah yeah

(1:11:27) a thing whereby females are fawning it's called a fawn response where we please
(1:11:34) we please been there been a wife a couple times um so if you think it's worth it
(1:11:42) to have her on we can if you you ask for it not me I'm I'm simply I'm deferring

(1:14:10) has he's you want to come back there's actually before I get back to one thing
(1:14:16) uh in an email you sent me you said you have personas like Eminem Slim Shady Marshall matters it's a it's a thing for
() 
(1:14:23) us genius black ghetto slave Souls inside sexy
(1:14:29) white bodies yeah well you guys weren't that
(1:14:35) interested in hearing about my I was I'm I'm interested are you
(1:14:41) interested about the black ghetto slave Soul inside or what what part of it were
(1:14:46) you interested in well sorry you were you said you guys weren't that interested in in what well so it goes
(1:14:53) back to my talk about white supremacy and trying to explain that it's an energetic matter it's an ideology it's a
(1:14:59) matter of ideology we did want to hear it but then you hit the the the no button well
(1:15:04) because it did not seem that you really wanted to understand it seemed that you wanted to propagate a particular
(1:15:12) ideology and that's exactly what I was trying to talk about but I wasn't was it a sorry sorry go I'd like to explain the
(1:15:20) concept from my worldview so that you understand cable donated
(1:15:27) $100 Madison blink twice slowly if you're in
(1:15:34) [Laughter] danger so imagine from my perspective
(1:15:41) right that I see that there's a world poool and you're in a boat and I everything that goes near this world
(1:15:47) pool gets sucked down okay and I say listen you're in this boat but if you go towards that Whirlpool it's going to
(1:15:53) suck you down and you go no no no listen from my perspective it's not a world poool it's a I don't know zazz
(1:16:01) baz you call it a Zazzle baz and you go and I think I can just sail right through it and I go no stupid it's a
(1:16:07) world poool and you're going to get sucked down into it and you're going to die don't do that and you go nope I'm going to do it anyway and you just go
(1:16:13) out and you get sucked down the world poool right that's how it is with ideologies too so when somebody says to
(1:16:19) me they're like ah it's just my ideology therefore it's just my opinion and so therefore you trying to say anything
(1:16:25) about it isn't correct it's like ah no I think it is I think it's fine to say see that Vortex there that makes no hang on
(1:16:31) hang on I'm almost done almost done okay okay so that little Whirlpool or
(1:16:37) whatever that you're about to go down right just trying to go ah don't do that don't do that okay so you're trying to
(1:16:45) be my daddy no I'm not trying to be your daddy I would do that for a total stranger really
(1:16:52) yeah I'm not really interested in being being protected by you it's not an interest of you it's an interest for me
(1:16:59) whether or not you're a person who says I'm going to pour gasoline on myself and light a match because I want to do this
(1:17:05) cuz I want to be emulated and completely cook myself and I see you going for that match I'll still stop you
() 
(1:17:13) anyway but the damage that you did to me in the last show if I was not such an
(1:17:20) emotionally stable person I would have gone home and killed myself okay so the you know it's really funny um there's a
(1:17:27) lot of prot there's a lot I'm not there to protect you I thought you just said that you you're not listening to what
(1:17:32) I'm saying I'm saying that I'm making a comparison to an ideology and saying to you that I'm not going to keep your
(1:17:38) fragile ideology intact or not destroy the fragile ideology if it's bad because
(1:17:44) that in some way is going to be emotionally painful that's cognitive dissonance that's that's what that is it
(1:17:49) is emotionally painful to shrug off bad ideologies that's true
(1:17:56) that's true it's just like saying okay my leg is broken okay well it healed wrong I got to break it again so it
(1:18:02) heals right it's the same thing and the more you propagate bad ideology the more
(1:18:08) you're going to see your ideology get broken over and over and over and over and over and over and over as the leg
(1:18:13) gets reset time and time and time again you call that emotional grape right I
(1:18:19) call it logic and reason okay I I got a couple questions
(1:18:27) um you said that you I don't want to reuse the word precisely the words you
(1:18:32) precisely used you said that you went home and wanted to harm yourself because
(1:18:38) you because of your experience on the show no I was saying that if I was less
(1:18:45) emotionally stable I could see how I would do that we've had over a thousand
(1:18:50) people on the show they're all fine when you sexually assault men couldn't that the result of that tooo could it
(1:18:56) couldn't it be the the result when you sexually assault men did you feel in danger Yeah well yeah of course yes of
(1:19:03) course any woman who's not my wife who in any way tries to put sections of her body near me like that in a sexually
(1:19:09) provocative way is dangerous as hell yeah oh yeah horribly dangerous I'm just curious had Andrew done something
(1:19:16) similar and he like exposed himself yeah went over and just whipped it out that would have been okay would you I would
(1:19:21) be comfortable with that oh my god do you think most women would I'm not most women right
(1:19:29) but Andrew's not like you Andrew's not like but here's the thing that's not passive aggressive that is you literally
(1:19:35) showing me exactly what you're trying to do when you use psychological tactics and emotional manipulation based off of
(1:19:41) my trauma responses that is passive aggressive that is then you trying to manipulate and hurt me rather than I
(1:19:48) would literally rather you pull down your pants and put your dick in my face then I know what I'm dealing with I did
(1:19:54) not know what I was going to be dealing with in the last show so it felt like it felt like that's what I'm saying it felt
(1:20:00) like a manipulation and an emotional rape because I did not know I thought I was literally coming on a dating podcast
(1:20:07) so I can understand from the perspective of saying that you'd rather see immediate action other than what you would consider to be passive aggressive
(1:20:13) or manipulative just rather see put your cards on the table so other than manipulative tactics
(1:20:22) right when you're saying manipulative tactics you're saying you would much rather see somebody be physically aggressive sure I can understand that
(1:20:29) that at least makes sense to me but isn't it also a form of passive aggressive manipulation to say because I
(1:20:35) have trauma responses to perceive things you don't know anything about me you there was no way for you to ever determine what these trauma responses
(1:20:41) would be um that me just having a normal conversation with you like I would anybody else on this show and have done
(1:20:47) a thousand times isn't that a form of manipulation well you had disclosed to me that you were not affected
(1:20:55) emotionally by anybody so did you same thing you said I'm deeply I'm
(1:21:01) deeply emotionally affected by people no what you said to me was you said listen
(1:21:07) this isn't a big deal right this conversation in this context doesn't matter doesn't matter to me that's what
(1:21:14) you said when but as we're you said this doesn't matter I have no respect for you
(1:21:19) and if I was a less emotional person I would have gone home and off myself I can handle it right
(1:21:25) no I was not saying that I had no emotion I was saying if I had less
() 
(1:21:30) emotional intelligence and tools to process those emotions I could
(1:21:36) understand with this bullying that people experienc which I had not
(1:21:41) honestly experienced anything like this before nothing like it at all yeah I never experienced anything like that
(1:21:47) either I never experienced a woman trying to sexually assault me so now at least I feel like we're on the same
(1:21:52) playing field yeah no it's not the same playing field toally SE assault somebody your perception of guy made argument
(1:21:59) which hurt my feelings therefore he emotionally graped me that's absurd okay that's like not in the same universe
(1:22:06) okay yeah all right yeah on tiered logic right it's not the same you win you want
(1:22:11) me to tell you you win I mean yeah yeah you know what yeah say say Andrew I'm
(1:22:17) trying do is literally get to the point of do you
(1:22:23) want me to get on my knees and submit no I all I want you to do is engage with
(1:22:28) the arguments that's it so that you can  with me no so I can understand your worldview so you can monetize
(1:22:35) with me no so that I can understand your worldview you understand my world viw really that's why you're I ask you a
(1:22:41) question about it I lead to the next to the next to the next and I still don't actually get coherent
(1:22:46) answers maybe that's well thought out on my part oh yeah I stole your
(1:22:51) pen it's well thought so you don't want to tell me what your ideology rude I don't want to tell my brain that
() 
(1:23:00) you give a about understanding me because it's not actually true yeah I
(1:23:05) would listen I would not be here if I didn't give a about other people's worldviews false no it's not false false
(1:23:12) I promise you I will not be here job Andrew what's your credential robotics mechanic a robotics mechanic what's your degrees in I don't have a degree how are
(1:23:20) you a robotics mechanic and you don't have a degree I have an apprenticeship and it's a trade okay so similar to life
(1:23:26) coaching let's say no it's not similar to life coaching let's say it's a trade though yeah it's a it's a real trade so
(1:23:33) life coaching is not a real trade I I don't know do people make a living doing it sure so what is your definition of a
(1:23:42) trade uh so to me a trade apprenticeship would be like an applied skill so so
(1:23:47) life coaching isn't an applied skill no I don't think it's a why would you have why would you have to go to a trade
(1:23:53) school to learn how to do it then if it's not a skill that you have to learn I'm not sure that those are trade schools I'm not sure give me the
(1:24:00) definition of a trade aren't you learning how to a skill to perform a trade that you can monetize yeah but
(1:24:06) they couldn't I mean that would fall under anything though right anything that you can monetize and you have to
(1:24:12) learn how to do it I would call that a trade skill TR okay well I mean if that's your definition I'll ConEd you
(1:24:18) the definition okay so I am so you have no degrees in psychology
(1:24:24) you have no Ministry degrees you've never been to any Ministry School those just appeals to Authority appeals to
(1:24:29) Authority so you so you want me to appeal to your Authority yet you
(1:24:36) literally have what a twoe twoyear training program and how to do robotics
(1:24:43) no what does that have to do with anything let's assume that I you know what the point is you're arguing with me
(1:24:51) Psy spirituality and all of these things that I've literally at least gone to
(1:24:57) trade school what have you done what would that matter let's say I was a sixth grade Dropout and I cleaned
(1:25:03) carpets for a living and was a cummer on the internet whose wife who had an open relationship with my wife let's say that
(1:25:10) was my background in what world would it make me wrong to question the things that you say if you're wrong about them
(1:25:16) regardless of whatever my degrees were in because you are questioning my authority as a
(1:25:23) psychologist when you're not a psychologist why do I need to be the thing to question the
(1:25:30) thing it's like saying you can't question the medication your doctor gives you unless you're a doctor like what questioning is one thing but having
(1:25:37) the condescendence to actually believe that you are right over what I am trained to be right in that's a little
(1:25:45) crossing a line I would say what's the line that you're crossing your tone the tone it's the wrong tone because I'm
(1:25:53) actually am I tone I am actually the authority in everything that you're talking about psychologically and
(1:25:59) spiritually and scholastically so you need to get yourself in
(1:26:05) line and question me as a student of those things because I'm actually the
(1:26:10) teacher you're the student well Mr Bulet donated $100 communicate from the Inquisition
(1:26:18) patriarchy Grand Inquisitor have you received the autographed blue white cup with certificate of authenticity I am
(1:26:25) performing an audit of our inventory not yet thank you Mr Boule but now
(1:26:31) appreciate it Mr I know what that even means that's a it doesn't have anything to do with this it's like a a show
(1:26:37) inside joke but anyway yeah so by this metric right if um if if somebody let's
(1:26:44) say is a boat maker right and they make for you a boat and you say hey it doesn't float and they go don't
() 
(1:26:51) question me I make boats so let me ask you something do you heal people's trauma uh I'm not so sure that you can
(1:26:59) heal anybody's trauma yeah you can you can really then how come you haven't healed your own I literally have well
(1:27:06) then why do you keep on talking about how you're traumatized all the time because trauma is an ongoing thing
(1:27:12) that we continually have to process you just re-traumatized every day yeah and then I have to process it every night
(1:27:18) and that's how I don't continue it on to the next day remember the Bible says don't don't go asleep don't
(1:27:25) R traumatized and then every day you heal yourself of your trauma yes every night before I go to bed every night
(1:27:30) okay so all of your old traumas that you keep appealing to is being problematic right divorces things like this from all
(1:27:38) those the bigger catastrophic traumas take a little bit more time they're more complex they don't take one night but
(1:27:44) for example well how many nights do they take it just depends okay do you want to talk about a specific trauma and how
(1:27:50) long it how long so how do you heal your trauma of your divorce how would you heal that the divorce wasn't the trauma
(1:27:56) what was the trauma being with the man okay how would you heal that it's been
(1:28:01) very hard so healed well it is healed in the sense that do you really want to go
(1:28:08) into it it's really dark well when you say healing no what I want to get into is this idea of healing trauma when you
(1:28:13) say do you heal trauma and I go I'm not sure you can heal trauma you go well you can and I say well do you want to expain
(1:28:20) it's like saying do there's a protocol in my book do you want to talk about how it's done which part of your book here let me just tell me the chapter here
(1:28:26) I'll have to find it Well I need the book to look at the chapter oh here I'll use this one okay okay I created a
(1:28:32) protocol to explain to you how to do it GMD gim donated $100 this is precisely the result of the
(1:28:40) closure of asylums back in the80s we now Embrace this stuff honey you are not
(1:28:46) trained you have been indoctrinated by other crazy people okay so right here on page 57 My
(1:28:54) Method processing severe trauma do you want me to read you the couple Pages it's only two pages it looks like or you
(1:28:59) can just give me a summarization well I'd just rather read it okay okay so my method processing severe
(1:29:07) trauma in my Relentless study of anthropology sociology and the psychology of various individuals I had
(1:29:13) come to realize that it was never the actual events um situations or words
(1:29:19) spoken that traumatize people for the most part rather it was their uncontrolled obsessive mental recalling
(1:29:25) of the situation then the meaning they assigned to it all that really had the
(1:29:31) power to either chronically or just acutely traumatize the person in other words there was a reason some people
(1:29:38) were just deeply shaken and grieved by certain things but then seemed to move on just fine While others seemed to get
(1:29:45) stuck severely traumatized for a lifetime it had nothing to do with how bad quote unquote the traumatic event
(1:29:51) was or not it had to do with how the the person felt and then handled it after the fact that doesn't as I mentioned
(1:29:58) previously I asked the infinite as I mentioned previously I asked the infinite to show me a way to process the
(1:30:05) loss of Steve and how to get rid of the graphic images from that night so that I wouldn't get PTSD post-traumatic stress
(1:30:12) disorder or any other long-term negative effects once I asked the question I started receiving inspired thoughts that
(1:30:19) ended up being the Practical step-by-step solution to this problem I had been trying to help people recover
(1:30:25) from abuse and other traumas for years and never actually believed it was possible up until then I believe the
(1:30:32) best people could do was learn to cope with their traumas so they didn't completely ruin their lives holding on
(1:30:37) to that belief created the reality for me by shutting my Raz off so that's the
(1:30:43) reticular activating system to any contradictory information hence a
(1:30:48) confirmation bias but now my mind was unlocked and I was asking my hire
(1:30:54) infinite self- better questions and believing there had to be a way this is what was downloaded into my mind from
(1:31:00) the infinite okay this is the this is the um method that came through okay
(1:31:05) place a meaning on the event that feels good no matter how far you must reach
(1:31:10) remember how I told you that the meaning we place on events is very powerful and completely within our power I decided I
(1:31:17) would believe that everything had happened exactly as it was supposed to with Steve my unborn baby my marriage
(1:31:25) my kids and my old life that had come to an end I also chose to believe this
(1:31:30) about all the rest of things including my childhood and being born to my parents in the dis in the dysfunctional
(1:31:38) family I would believe it all happened as it was supposed to I would believe that I was an infinite spiritual being
(1:31:45) who had chosen to Incarnate into this human existence because there were things that I wanted to experience that
(1:31:51) would deepen my understanding and love for myself for life and for other
(1:31:57) Souls that my willingness to have these experiences and let them deepen me
(1:32:03) is it just going to be a booking yes I told you that I would be able to share and the sharing would feel really
(1:32:10) good to me she's just not going to stop these beliefs I told you it was only two pages these beliefs felt good and right
(1:32:16) and empowering so I put them in my thought Nursery to give them
(1:32:21) attention and any okay so Desiree I don't know you read
(1:32:27) the section that's pertinent to the conversation no I he wanted to know my process but I got your process your no
() 
(1:32:34) you didn't there's still more yeah we got to move it on your process your process is you ask God in Cope that's
(1:32:40) the process no it's not it's how to Rel INF the infinite is God and then you I
(1:32:45) just told you you have to you have to place a meaning on the event that feels
(1:32:50) good that's called cope it's not called C that's cope that is doing everything you can take
(1:32:58) the event and pretend it's something other than what the event is that is C it's yes it is agree to disagree grab a
(1:33:04) happy image and put it into the thought Nursery now if you read my book you would know what the thought Nursery is
(1:33:10) to dwell on for a few minutes let the better feelings associated with the happy image emerge breathe into these
(1:33:17) better feelings and Savor them I did this as many times a day as necessary so what I would have to do is so the image
(1:33:24) was of my friend dead on the oper on the table basically blue with intubated and everything he died and they made me go
(1:33:31) back and see him dead on the table and his mom wanted me to delay the coroner from taking his body that's the only
(1:33:36) reason I had to see him dead I don't recommend people do that there's no  point but anyway I had to go and
(1:33:42) see this man who died in my arms first and then was tried they tried to resuscitate him obviously and abated him
(1:33:49) he's blue on the table his mom I had to tell Steve's dead well I didn't tell her
(1:33:54) that but I told her I don't know he's unconscious she met me at the hospital
(1:34:00) but on her way there she was begging me to stall the coroner from taking his body because they wanted time for the
(1:34:06) brother to come and be able to see I don't know why people want to traumatize themselves by doing this again I don't
(1:34:12) recommend forcing yourself to see your loved one dead that's not necessarily trauma that's part of the closure
(1:34:18) process okay well for some it is but for a lot of people they get stuck on those images for me I got stuck with him
(1:34:24) blue intubated people have a disconnection between what is life you want to hear how I got over that and
() 
(1:34:30) didn't get we got we got to move to the next point but before we do before I'd like to stay on this point right so
(1:34:37) people have a huge disconnection from what is life and what is death not everybody and by the way
(1:34:45) people used to have to deal with death a lot more they used to have to deal with dead bodies a lot more things like this
(1:34:51) I don't think that it's ingrained to be traumatic necessarily it's something
(1:34:56) that people just don't really have to deal with very much so it becomes not personal it always becomes somebody
(1:35:02) else's dealing with it you're just dealing with a memory but the thing is is that when you say things like take
(1:35:09) this thing that actually happened and put a fun happy spin on it so it's something that you remember fondly
(1:35:14) instead that is an Embrace of delusion so how's that not cope if I can
(1:35:21) have a bit of some like extended so we kind of veered off of this I was
(1:35:27) asking how me or Andrew or the show is woman hating I did not get an adequate
() 
(1:35:39) response because I'm a woman and I've shared a lot with you and it's never
(1:35:45) been met with any sort of understanding or empathy it's only been met with
(1:35:50) hostility and like this weird commitment to
(1:35:56) not understanding me and can I just say the same thing to you sure no empathy no understanding
(1:36:05) sure if that's how you feel so can you I
(1:36:13) mean what's that Aristotle quote about crying okay so crying is one of the ways
(1:36:22) that the body processes the trauma in real time that way we don't hold on to it or is it a way to appeal to emotion
(1:36:29) to try to get people onto your side without actually having a strong Foundation or position for what you're
(1:36:35) actually trying to say and argue that is a way that people who lack genuine
(1:36:41) empathy that is a way that they use appeared emotion to manipulate
(1:36:47) others but my emotion is actually genuine okay well
(1:36:54) I I don't see how that has anything to do with a woman
(1:37:07) hating I'm a Healer as women were gifted
(1:37:18) with special abilities to
(1:37:24) take on I'm just look this is these are words
(1:37:30) that you said GMD Jim donated $100 trust not a woman when she weeps
(1:37:38) for it is her nature to weep when she wants her will Socrates Socrates yeah
(1:37:44) okay well if you if you're not comfortable with me crying I'm going to have to go because some of the things
() 
(1:37:50) we're talking about C that's fine I'm still just trying to understand aside
(1:37:57) from how you felt I don't if there's something you can point I don't think that you are
(1:38:02) trying to understand anything I think that you are trying to
(1:38:08) bring a point across so just just say what your point is that you would like to prove and then I can
(1:38:16) just submit and we can move on I'm I'm not really sure if that's
(1:38:22) what I'm trying to do but earlier in the show you said that me and Andrew are woman hating the show is
(1:38:29) woman hating so I'm asking you to point to something specific I I I I keep doing it and you
(1:38:37) don't want to accept it so I don't see the point and continuing the conversation I told you that I am a
(1:38:43) woman and I didn't feel safe and I don't feel safe in your presence hence woman
(1:38:49) hating because I am a representative of woman well so if I I'm a man and I feel
(1:38:54) uncomfortable in your presence does that mean you're a manher you can say that if that's how you feel does it make it true
(1:39:02) would you agree or disagree with that statement that I am a manher because I feel unsafe in your presence I would
(1:39:08) validate if that's how I made you feel at least but would it make you a manher
(1:39:14) or would you be like no I'm not a man possibly if man if man is taking your
(1:39:21) form then yes male if man is taking your form then yes
(1:39:26) there is hatred there because it's not you as a soul it's you as an ideology
(1:39:32) coming at me and not inviting me to feel safe in your
(1:39:38) presence didn't you just so me and Andrew were sitting here we were sitting
() 
(1:39:43) down we were just talking at moments it was a lively conversation but we were remaining in
(1:39:50) our seats was it Andrew or was it me or
(1:39:55) was it you who got out of their seat came all the way over here got into our
(1:40:01) physical space and I mean Andrew is sitting to my left who was that was that
(1:40:06) us or was it you it was me invoked by you you invited me to I invited you
(1:40:14) to walk over and get into our physical space yes how did I so you're saying we
(1:40:20) consented to that I am saying that you didn't give a about my personal space emotionally so I didn't give a
(1:40:27) about your physical space that doesn't make any sense I gave you a taste of your own medicine and you
(1:40:34) didn't like it so what was the point you were trying to prove give you a taste of your own
(1:40:40) medicine what was the medicine which we were dispensing so you could feel what it feels like to be disrespected the
(1:40:46) medicine you claim we were dispensing disrespect you this conversation while
(1:40:51) we disagree has actually been fairly uh I mean there were times where it got a bit heated but it's otherwise been
(1:40:58) fairly in times where there was sexual assault let's not forget that um I like in any case so when it comes to your
(1:41:05) safety and this being evidence of woman hating yeah we've remained here while
(1:41:11) you might disagree with what we say you got out of your chair walked around the table we didn't know if you were going
(1:41:17) to strike us or what you were going to do you were scared did I scare you
() 
(1:41:23) why are you smiling when you say that that's interesting because I it makes me feel more safe to know that maybe I have
(1:41:30) some sort of power in your presence you do realize women have capacity for
(1:41:36) violence I'm not a fighter you could say I well hold on we don't know that like you could
(1:41:45) have come over here smacked in the face Pagan donated $100 what did you think think coming on
(1:41:51) ATA podcast debate meant a debate is adversarial in nature when you tone
(1:41:57) police it equates to you have nothing to say in the purpose to derail the
(1:42:02) conversation so I mean can I ask you a question so going I guess going back to the we felt you felt unsafe in the
(1:42:09) emotional space so you as retribution you wanted to make us feel unsafe in the
(1:42:15) physical space correct and that's why you got out of your chair walked all the way around here and I mean we didn't
(1:42:21) know if you're were going to try to strike in closer but you ESS pulled up your
(1:42:28) correct your dress and put his your ass right in his
(1:42:34) yes space yes so I wanted you to understand the height of how you guys
(1:42:42) affect me emotionally and spiritually it was like that so do you think other
(1:42:47) forms of let's I mean I would let's I would rather you beat me I would literally rather you punch in the face
(1:42:53) well I'm not interested in doing that so hold on um would you say that even if I don't
(1:43:01) categorize what you did specifically as a violent act

(1:52:55) you'll have a little time we can talk for a little bit um I'm surprised though that it was
(1:53:01) me that I think precipitated The Rage Quit no it wasn't
(1:53:08) well I mean I asked her about the woman hating Andrew was off having a smoke and she started crying when I asked her oh
(1:53:15) about the woman hating and then that's when she I mean look there's stuff that happened before that but I'm surprised
(1:53:23) that that's kind of what uh broke the camel the straw that broke the camel's back
(1:53:29) yeah um so you were you were extremely calm I
(1:53:36) thought we were super calm yeah
(1:53:41) um so whatever well for her it was
(1:53:47) control it was emotional grape yeah she made it very clear that that's crazy
(1:53:53) the the whole thing has to do with control so well did you hear the part about how I said that she felt like
(1:54:00) violence in this scenario in response to our conduct would have been Justified yeah she said that yeah she
(1:54:07) said yeah cuz I mean I said well and she could have gotten away with it that's what she said she would have gotten away
(1:54:12) with it legally she has no understanding of the uh yeah so guys stick around we're going to
(1:54:19) pull up the DMS these are you think it's it's too bad she wasn't here because she could have put it in her own voice the
(1:54:26) DMS we rece we've received from this woman are insane um we do have the footage I know we kind
(1:54:34) of when she tried to attack Andrew in that sort of way we have a
(1:54:41) security camera footage of it just for the stream though we had to like go to our intro screen just cuz we didn't know if she was going to what she was going
(1:54:48) to do so we do have it I don't know i' have to think a little bit about
(1:54:53) posting it but if we did post it we'd put it on my uh Discord um in any case she I can tell
(1:55:00) you a little bit about what the DM say she's been she's all over the place she wants to
(1:55:06) uh thread she's been threatening me with lawsuits because of the emotional toll
(1:55:14) the podcast took on her but she's also simultaneously been flirting with
(1:55:20) me sending you sending me nudes un
(1:55:26) unrequested uh sending me nudes she's been saying she wants to have she wanted
(1:55:31) to like do things to me and Andrew
(1:55:37) sexually very strange very peculiar so so one day she'll be threatening to Sumi

(2:04:19) in the there was like a little exchange I just happen to glance over Brian doing this exchange and I I saw in her text
(2:04:26) message that she said that she shouldn't have to talk to me because I have absolutely no
(2:04:33) education well given that she's come today I'm sure you didn't agree to all
(2:04:39) of those things right how did you get her to come back oh I mean there's I said no to almost all of those yeah and
(2:04:46) then and then we came to a determination which um so

(2:06:36) bro man wild time in the whatever studio today Brian wild time
(2:06:42) today so we should put the camera on Maddie so you guys can see her vacuuming that's probably more entertaining than
(2:06:49) just watching two
(2:06:54) middle-aged just sitting here at the table
(2:07:00) cheers can we put the camera on Madd she's doing a great job
(2:07:07) oh yeah we should play with that maybe I don't know hold
(2:07:13) on jeez it's just like a bunch of happened all at
(2:07:19) once but I think they're getting it under control this chick's going to come back for round two

(2:07:34) can't can't just let it end like that right we got to let it finish

(2:07:52) it's a big [Laughter] [Applause]
(2:07:58) Todo are you [Music] [Laughter]
(2:08:03) [Applause] serious W whatever
(2:08:09) podcast all right let's uh let's uh color commentate this all right there
(2:08:14) she is look at the technique solid you're out of
(2:08:20) frame done keep going just keep going we're we're commentating uh
(2:08:26) ooh a bit of a fail there letting the wire drag a true uh you know look she's a little flustered with the vacuuming
(2:08:33) but she's doing great look at the technique as you can see she's right-handed oh she's double fisting it
(2:08:38) double fisting the vacuum and the broom let's see what she can do great job moving the chair away under the couch to
() 
(2:08:45) the the foot a little caught up on that chair Brian urinated the couch the couch was urinated on who knows what happened
(2:08:51) look look at that great technique f ah you know that chord technique she
(2:08:57) really doesn't have that chord WP Brian I think she needs to do something about that cord
(2:09:05) wrap you know the great thing the great thing though is due to her height she's closer to the ground so she's the
(2:09:11) velocity of the uh vacuum it's really good you know unfortunately this vacuum is not the top of the line for sure I'm
(2:09:17) not saying not one of the top players in the field Brian most certainly one of the top players [Applause]
(2:09:23) but not perfect not perfect technique I've seen better unfortunately
(2:09:30) we can't quite see uh looks like another camera oh there's there's there's
(2:09:35) producer oh okay all right Nick's cutting it off she's she's went over on her her time for the uh I I would give
(2:09:42) that a 7.5 out of 10 I'm going to go with a six I really think you're being a little bit too charitable oh she's back
(2:09:48) at it she's she won't take no for answer she's back at the vacuuming folks look at the technique fantastic well I'm
(2:09:54) going to have to reappraise now that I understand that there's a little bit more determination going on here [Applause]
(2:10:00) Brian I don't think we can we [Applause]
(2:10:07) [Laughter] see well there she
(2:10:13) [Applause] is how you how do you color commentate vacuuming I feel like we did it we did
(2:10:20) pretty good I feel like we did it yeah now Maddie does tend to prefer the back and forth technique I'm more F you know
(2:10:26) I find the the uh notice too the real pros can do can
(2:10:33) do this in such a way where it's just one sweep and done I noticed she did go over certain areas that really cost her
(2:10:38) a lot of time Brian you know it did it did but sometimes the way she was doing it it
(2:10:44) can be a bit more of effective you know just going over one spot over and over again instead of kind of doing you know
(2:10:49) I have vuum also is the so I got go back and you player
(2:10:56) excuse making Brian
(2:11:03) bro yeah yeah can you sweep a bit too Maddie now we're moving into the sweeping uh the sweeping what's the what
(2:11:09) are the terms for the
(2:11:17) sweep uh well I'm going to have to start the sweep technique at a two fantastic not not doing so hot on the
(2:11:24) the uh the last part of the sweep up that's a really bad form usually you angle the broom up with one hand well I
(2:11:31) feel like we got to be positive all right Maddie she um now she absolutely demolished the regional competition when
(2:11:38) she was competing in the sweep Aon and the uh vacuum Pro and uh there's Nick
(2:11:44) there with the uh there he is look at that strong technique double he's got he
(2:11:50) uses the uh two finger on the spray bottle that's really good and we got Maddie over there she's just kind of
(2:11:55) taking a break not really doing anything not really helping you know of course I noticed that Nick is using the patented
(2:12:01) Rachel Wilson technique where he get right down and scrub the entire floor
(2:12:07) surface very it was well done it was great it was great well done yes well done you know look it's her first uh her
(2:12:14) first participation in the uh domestic duties uh competition here in the whatever podcast but I think for her for
(2:12:20) sure showing she really did put on quite a show I think she you know many years to come she'll be uh this is an annual
(2:12:27) event she can only improve from here Brian only improve from here so we do want to uh bow our bow our

(2:18:16) wait wait can we not can we not do that no I I am who I am if if you can't
() 
(2:18:21) handle the crying I can go I understand it's not a guy thing I get it but I have
(2:18:26) spent my whole life studying a very particular part
(2:18:32) of life and it's trauma healing and it's very important to me and I'm not willing
(2:18:37) to let my platform be degraded by somebody who doesn't even have a degree in Psychology or anything he's talking
(2:18:43) about so at least promote yourself as not an expert and me as an expert at
(2:18:49) least in this one field that I actually am an expert in and if I can't be
(2:18:54) respected as the expert in a particular field which I will shrink down to trauma
(2:19:01) healing trauma healing that's what I'm an expert at trauma healing okay if I
(2:19:09) can be respected as an expert an expert mhm in extreme trauma
(2:19:17) healing okay and you're not okay if I can be
(2:19:24) respected as that at least then we might be able to have
(2:19:29) conversations okay can I have you elaborate on what a trauma healer is yes
(2:19:36) I can help people mhm take the most extreme traumas and I know how to help
(2:19:45) them transform it into something good and release it from their
(2:19:51) body in the sense that it no longer causes them suffering
(2:19:56) okay is and I just want to be clear on this so I
(2:20:03) understand the idea of assisting people with what you're calling trouble well
(2:20:08) first let's start with I wasn't looking for this I was looking for an apology that you excerted yourself as any sort
(2:20:15) of expert in the field that I the way that you are using your
(2:20:21) Linguistics mhm is very degrading yeah but that's an
(2:20:27) emotional state right it doesn't matter if it's emotional or not literally people are making their choices based
(2:20:34) off of emotion what you so donated $99 love how goes from crying to normal
(2:20:41) in 025 seconds but claims to be genuine also coming from a professional in
(2:20:48) Psychology you do more harm than good all you learned was
(2:20:53) manipulation um so well let's just why we just you want to just do the apology and then I can get back into my it it
(2:20:59) just goes like this Andrew I'm sorry Desiree you know a lot more in the subject of trauma healing than I do and
(2:21:06) I will submit to that now let's move on to a different subject that's actually entertaining to people because
(2:21:13) we've been having the same conversation like over and over and over again in different ways and I'm done with
(2:21:19) it so let's move on to geopolitics or something else okay we can move on to geopolitics I think Andrew will give you
(2:21:26) the apology there's a bit extra asks there
(2:21:31) I'm not sure he's going to be able to give look I'll give you the apology I'm sorry you feel this
(2:21:39) way that's not an apology what do you mean yes it is didn't repair the damage paladins
(2:21:46) donated $100 the fake tears stopped as fast as they started evil manipulator sociopath
(2:21:54) stay strong men don't quite night overcome your genetic programming okay well I'm sorry that you
(2:22:02) have an inability to have an emotional in emotional control while we have a conversation I'm sorry that you're
(2:22:08) psychotic and a lunatic wait no no no I'm sorry that you're about as wise as
(2:22:14) um you know okay okay so anyway I'm sorry I'm sorry you feel that way so there we go
(2:22:20) I'll get no I'll do okay I I'm sorry desire desire if I'm going to apologize
(2:22:25) you got to look me in the eyes that's fair right if I apologize will you look at me I'm I apologize I'm
(2:22:32) sorry is
(2:22:40) that Pegasus 25 donated $100 being a paid prostitute isn't

(2:22:57) expert oh okay imagine the like hubris of somebody who sexually batters you and
(2:23:02) then demands you apologize to them can you imagine the hubris of a person like that like and I'm the
(2:23:09) psychopath hold on desire hold on hold on hold on no I'll I'll walk out I'll walk I'll walk over there and let you
(2:23:15) guys let me have a little convo Andrew's goingon to take a break Andrew's gonna take a break it's okay me and Desiree
(2:23:21) dese are we are you my Caucasian dese are we
(2:23:28) homies are we homies are you going to protect me I do you want me to smack
(2:23:34) Andrew around a bit is that yes I do he's really inappropriate well he's also
(2:23:39) my Caucasian I can't smack him around but I you can you actually can I'm not
(2:23:44) at Liberty to do that and also you can are you a man I identify as a a man okay
() 
(2:23:51) so your job is literally to protect me I I but I need to protect Andrew too
(2:23:57) why he can't protect himself he clearly can look I can't I literally can't
(2:24:02) Andrew has a very strong handshake if I were to he might don't me I literally cannot I cannot protect myself
(2:24:10) emotionally from this man it would be your responsibility to protect me emotionally if you're not going to do it
(2:24:16) I can't stay I told him to go in to to take a smoke okay so are you going to keep protecting me I yes do you promise
(2:24:25) do I have your word that you will keep protecting me I'll try my best that's
(2:24:32) all I have shared a lot of personal information about myself I think you know what is important to me at this
(2:24:39) point it's not that hard to say will you protect the things that are important to
(2:24:44) me yeah yes but we we need to establish boundaries for everybody so when it came
(2:24:51) to like the topics you didn't want to come up you went immediately and attacked Andrew and the thing is like
(2:24:57) because you're making me because you're not protecting me you need to protect me from the ridiculous things that this man
(2:25:04) is saying to innocent Minds we have a responsibility Brian there are innocent
(2:25:11) Minds watching this we cannot allow this man there's a couple cumers I understand I understand

(2:25:48) concealed man donating literally felt why you guys have to go
(2:25:53) through this again it's obvious that she's mentally unstable it's ironic that
(2:25:59) she calls herself trauma healer while causing the same trauma herself she's
(2:26:04) sick so anyways um can we go back I did want to go back
(2:26:10) in the email you sent me you said you have the personas like Eminem SL Shady Marshall
(2:26:16) matters and you said it's a thing for us like the Persona thing it's a thing for us genius black ghetto slave Souls
(2:26:23) inside sexy white sexy white
(2:26:29) bodies what do you want to know about it I was just like do you identify as
(2:26:36) black I identify as very complex and very misunderstood
() 
(2:26:43) because of my external appearance no I know but like do you identify as a black
(2:26:51) woman no Native American I identify more with a Native American construct yes you
(2:26:59) just cuz in the email you said black ghetto slave Soul yeah inside sexy white
(2:27:04) body well if you want to go into how I was raised I was raised to be a sex slave well that's hold on but I'm more
(2:27:11) focused on the black Brian honest to be honest with you you don't have the depth
(2:27:18) of understanding for me to go into that so let's just skip over that and let's just go to something else I agree I
(2:27:24) think we should move on um in in some emails there was
(2:27:33) uh you for a $200 TTS you wanted to to
(2:27:40) kiss trying I was trying to come up with playful games that we could play to keep
(2:27:45) things more light and connecting because those things create a sense of safety
() 
(2:27:51) for me and as if we are even though we might be you know disagreeing with each other
(2:27:59) and having those are the types of things that help me feel safe with men so it's more of a playful thing like I have no
(2:28:06) problem you know having this energy of of um intellect or competitiveness or
(2:28:13) egos or things like that the back and forth banter but I need to feel like it's a playful thing if I don't feel
(2:28:19) like it's playful then I take it as a malicious attack and again I'm going to repeat it's not so much about protecting
(2:28:27) me it's about protecting my platform that I've worked literally my entire
(2:28:32) life to master a particular very particular

(2:31:08) get into the DMs I guess because they were kind of interesting there's a lot I hope we can get through all of them I'm
(2:31:14) not really interested in discussing our private conversations let's move on to social commentary or other things like
(2:31:19) that well I think the DMS are uh it's personal
(2:31:24) information well I mean you were also threatening me with filing a lawsuit it wasn't a threat it was a a court
(2:31:31) mediated process that I have to take no you said you would go file a class
(2:31:37) action lawsuit against because I have to if this wasn't going to be a restitution show because I'm now in a custody
(2:31:42) situation because of the last show not a party to your but you said you got 100% custody because of it well I had to take
(2:31:49) 100% Cody because after that situation my ex escalated in his yeah but didn't
(2:31:56) that work out well for you no
(2:32:01) because do you want to understand the wild donated $100 Jesus this chick is batshit crazy
(2:32:09) Andrew please call up the Santa Barbara PD and Report the sa charge giant H to
(2:32:15) the University of Irvine okay um but I'm not I'm not going to do
(2:32:22) that if you apologize apologize for what for the sexual battery I'm sorry sorry
(2:32:29) for what that I made you feel sexually battered oh so I I mean if that's the
() 
(2:32:37) apology it's the same apology that you gave me but you said it that that was an unacceptable apology well you reap what
(2:32:44) you seow so I'm not going to give you a well then if we're doing you reap as you seow and you don't want me to move over
(2:32:49) to Christian ethics where I usually don't do eye for an eye and I'm usually a pretty forgiving person just let
(2:32:55) things go right I'm sorry that I put my beautiful ass in your lap yeah I'm
(2:33:03) really sorry that that made you uncomfortable I Chris donated $100 please call CPS and take her
(2:33:10) children away from her they should play this entire podcast to the judge when deciding custody I just left you a
(2:33:17) OnStar review on Amazon for her book everyone do it no that's we're not going
(2:33:23) to we're not going to you're not going to do like that so the thing is that's that's remarkably actually
(2:33:28) unhelpful in always the thing is is I would like to get into you and a social
(2:33:33) theory that I have and I'd like to explain it to you and get your takes because you are the expert have you ever heard of what's called Magic
(2:33:39) Theory no magic Theory goes like this this is considered a highly chauvinistic I suppose Theory I don't
(2:33:47) think it is but essentially if a woman cannot control you through sexuality they move to manipulation if they can't
(2:33:53) control you through manipulation um they move over to empathy so these are mechanisms of
(2:33:59) control for that would be a mechanism of a sociopathic female yes but haven't you
(2:34:06) demonstrated all of those traits today I would say I had to cycle through the
(2:34:11) toxic version of those things and I arrived back on a genuine um presentation of femininity
(2:34:20) but you started I have I have just been simply responding to your toxic masculinity that you've been putting on
(2:34:27) me so I've been trauma responding with toxic femininity yes it's a protective measure so then you were acting in a way
(2:34:34) which you considered to be sociopathic no because I wasn't being manipulative with my emotions but I I will admit to
(2:34:42) um intentional aggression against you yes but my crying and when you touched
(2:34:48) points of me that made me cry I wasn't trying to invoke any sort of empathy in you as clearly you don't have any and
(2:34:54) you've stated that many times and you don't care how I feel didn't say I never St for you that was just me trying to
(2:35:01) literally in real time process my own trauma so I could move forward with the
(2:35:06) conversation well you can agree that um and I would agree with you too that
(2:35:12) empathy is important but you do you would have to agree with me that sometimes people will utilize empathy as
(2:35:19) a weapon true in order to get you to respond a certain way through manipulation So when
(2:35:24) you say well wait a second Andrew respond to me this way right and I'm
(2:35:29) going to present present myself this way which looks very manipulative and then say well wait a second you're not
(2:35:36) responding with empathy so therefore you're you're a sociopath something like this isn't that kind of textbook
(2:35:44) manipulation Andrew it can be whatever
(2:35:52) you whatever you need me to say to move along with the conversation I consent so we can move
(2:35:58) along okay so you're just going to admit then that you've been being extremely
(2:36:03) manipulative this entire time well that's what you want correct well I mean I want you to tell the
(2:36:09) truth that's what I want no you don't yes I do I I don't agree with you well I
(2:36:15) mean so you can read my mind I really you this would have been a
(2:36:21) totally really a really productive conver you should go back and look at all the debates I've done on here oneon-one they've always been super
(2:36:27) respectful and they've been they've really gone places which are good good places to go this one has just literally
() 
(2:36:33) been a a  here why are you still here talking because I still think perhaps I
(2:36:39) can get to some kind of worldview which we can discuss I can still hope that whether we
(2:36:45) will or not but you but but if you're just going to obstruct every time we get somewhere which is productive because
(2:36:51) you might have to take responsibility that's that's no good so
(2:36:57) I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't you're just damned if you don't if you're damned if you refuse to engage
(2:37:08) right poor he donated $100 let's be clear she didn't wi in
(2:37:15) custody of her kids she's holding them hostage from their dad
(2:37:22) okay anyway so yeah that's that's I just you
(2:37:27) know I want to get into the aspects because because you're kind of a master right doesn't it doesn't it even stand a
(2:37:33) reason that if you're a master it's psychology and you are an expert in Psychology that you would also be an
(2:37:38) expert in employing manipulation tactics and psychological tricks in order to get people to empathize with your
(2:37:45) position yes yeah so I mean if that's true there's no reason for me to assume that you haven't been doing that okay
(2:37:53) okay well I I suppose also to Andrew's Point there's been multiple times throughout the conversation where we
(2:37:59) were talking about the white supremacy stuff we were talking about the your accusations of woman hating and instead
() 
(2:38:06) of engaging you would just be like nope not talking about it
(2:38:12) don't want to talk about it so I think that's what he's talking about I'm trying to keep my nervous
(2:38:18) system regulated so I can keep having a conversation without crying okay all right well what's what
(2:38:25) is the um I know that you can't always explain this but what is the the motivation
(2:38:31) behind the crying did is it because you feel bad
(2:38:36) it's because my heart feels broken in certain moments and that's all I know
(2:38:42) how to move forward from that position is to
(2:38:47) release it if I try to hold on on to it it turns into something ugly so crying
(2:38:54) is actually a protective measure to keep me from attacking you in a way that would
(2:39:01) be mean and malicious I would rather just take in the Pain release it and
(2:39:10) then see if I can reather myself to continue the conversation or see if it's
(2:39:15) just done and I just need to leave well I think we can continue the convers ation maybe we can get in a place where
(2:39:22) both of us have some common ground right I have kids just like you do with my kids biological yeah biological how old
(2:39:31) are they um so the uh the youngest is well I don't even want to get into their
(2:39:37) ages and there's reasons why but because I don't I have people who are not good people who will weaponize so you know
(2:39:44) how it feels do all sorts of yeah I've never weaponized your kids against you ever no I'm saying though but that is
(2:39:49) what happened because of the last show and that's why I'm in a tough spot yeah I mean yeah I because my kids got
() 
(2:39:56) weaponized because of the show I can't I'm not responsible for that I'm not saying that you are but I am saying
(2:40:04) that the places that you're leading me are subjecting me and usus my mothering
(2:40:15) to well I'm I'm not things that are very traumatic for my children yeah I'm not going to try to do that that that wasn't
(2:40:22) the example I I see the allowance of comments coming in still about my
(2:40:28) children about CPS about child abuse about me being an abuser and I explicitly asked I get the same comments
(2:40:35) I understand that but I am actually in a active case because of this exact had my
(2:40:43) house swatted four times okay I get it no you don't get it I've had my house swatted four times
(2:40:50) had the police called me multile times all for expressing an opinion just like you we in the same boat if you're going
(2:40:55) to be a public figure you're going to risk offense and if you risk offense sometimes crazy people are going to do
(2:41:01) bad things to you that's not my criticism my criticism is that I did not
(2:41:06) know that that's what I was getting myself into when I came to the last show I did not know that that's what I was
(2:41:12) getting myself into I genuinely didn't I was under the impression that I was coming to a dating podcast just to
(2:41:19) discuss amongst other people like what's going on in the dating world that's
(2:41:25) literally all I thought why would you assume that people would be less likely to be have strong emotional opinions
(2:41:31) about dating than they do anything else guess I guess I was sheltered I just I didn't yeah they people have strong
(2:41:36) emotional opinions about everything from politics to dating to interpersonal relationships they have strong opinions
(2:41:43) about circumcision they have strong opinions about everything and if you're if you don't have right think there's
(2:41:48) always going to be people who disagree with you and are going to try to do bad things I feel I feel as if
(2:41:56) the explicit animosity towards me as a mother and my children was very extreme
(2:42:04) but you're the one you're the ones that allow the comments or not you you remind
(2:42:09) people that there's certain trigger things and things that are so toxic you don't allow it so therefore I know you
(2:42:15) have a censoring process yet you're still letting these comments so there's no censoring process so what
(2:42:22) happens is keywords which would affect the algorithm get censored that's what he's talking about with toxic comments
(2:42:28) so if somebody so you notice how comments are coming through that have particular slurs which are quite vicious
(2:42:33) towards women those get filtered out but saying generalized statements like oh I think this woman is a bad mother um you
(2:42:41) can't really do much about those if you're going to open if you're going to put yourself on the internet at all and put yourself as a public figure you are
(2:42:48) going to risk offending people people and they are going to some sometimes you're going to have Bad actors who will
(2:42:53) do horrible things I I I tend to try my hardest to ignore that myself because
(2:43:00) I've had people do horrible things to me horrible and the thing is is I don't hold uh even even my haters I don't even
(2:43:08) hold them responsible cuz most of my haters aren't so insane that they would take it to that level Jessica Rel loaded
(2:43:14) donated $100 you are responsible for yourself and what happened on the last show take
(2:43:21) accountability for yourself why come back if you felt unsafe did you not
(2:43:26) research the show before you came on the first time I didn't that's correct well hold
(2:43:32) on there Nick could you pull up uh layer six so this is your very first message
(2:43:40) to us requesting to be on the show back May May 30th of
(2:43:48) 2024 uh you're going to have to put this in the corner that's yeah that's fine go

(2:43:59) glasses okay I can't see it MD can you read it yeah a friend referred me to you guys to join your podcast for a very
() 
(2:44:06) interesting episode on how I basically solved all of world problems simply by flipping the script of the patriarchy
(2:44:12) and going back to a system where women do the choosing I'm a salant so social
(2:44:19) scientist only fans model and a good old American made single mom of three trying to get my bills paid out here in a man's
(2:44:26) world I could really use some exposure to bring in money and it's just a super interesting topic that I could go on
(2:44:31) about as it's near and dear to my heart I mean so you reached out to us so
(2:44:39) that's what I thought that I would be discussing you did discuss that but I
(2:44:46) mean the show I thought it would be respect Ed what would be respected My
(2:44:52) Views well we we have a panel of people who will provide pre-show notes some of
(2:44:58) the topics that they request to speak on if it's pertinent to the theme of our
(2:45:04) show we'll bring it up we did bring up quite a bit of some of the things you
(2:45:09) discussed I did you were you under the impression it was going to be a one-on-one interview yeah there's that's
(2:45:14) not possible I didn't know that it was a panel show I mean every single clip I I didn't watch any of the clips I honestly
(2:45:20) didn't know anything about the show and I do take responsibility that's entirely on you I know I understand on the very
(2:45:26) Instagram that you sent that you sent us a DM to requesting to be on the show there are Clips on that Instagram we
(2:45:32) don't post a bunch there are Clips indicating that it's a panel show there's multiple people on the panel I
(2:45:38) take respons can watch full live responsibility I literally we don't hide anything with this show anybody can just
(2:45:44) click the first link hold on you got to stop interrupting anybody can click the first link
(2:45:49) go directly to the YouTube channel at the very top it's going to show the full live streams didn't I didn't do it
(2:45:55) that's on you I know I'm I'm if if I'm going on the show I'm going to do research I get it I'm saying it's on me
(2:46:01) that was my bad right but you you cannot then blame you canot shift the blame on
(2:46:06) us that you felt like you didn't know what you're getting
(2:46:11) into you didn't you didn't see one clip no I didn't not my thing
(2:46:19) well I mean you okay
(2:46:27) um I mean I don't remember the it was a seven or eight hour show I don't
(2:46:33) remember everything that was talked about we talk about various things dating related well she she was able to
(2:46:38) you did bring up the idea of patriarchy the reversal uh how you're living in a man's world you brought up a ton of uh
(2:46:45) very interesting psychological ideas you brought up a lot it just seems to me like every time you were challenged on
(2:46:52) them so what it looks like from my perspective is that I don't mind talking
(2:46:57) about these ideas I think that it's fun to talk about ideas like that but I have noticed this trend and pattern of women
(2:47:03) who if their ideas get challenged they get really upset to the point where they begin to think that they are personally
() 
(2:47:10) being attacked rather than the idea they're espousing and they can't make the delineation between the two the idea
(2:47:16) which I'm saying and the me which one is actually being attacked here I think
(2:47:21) it's fine to attack ideas without personally attacking the person do you
(2:47:27) understand that men and women are not built the same yes okay
(2:47:33) so a lot of the problem is I wasn't even designed to have a debate with you were
(2:47:40) you designed to be in politics no were you designed to be in leadership roles were you designed to vote were you
(2:47:47) designed to pick the government which is going to rule people were you designed for any of that no well then why so then
(2:47:54) women probably shouldn't participate in any of those Avenues well let me clarify I was designed to take a leadership role
(2:48:03) yes I do not believe that Divine Humanity was made to have a government I
(2:48:08) don't believe that American governmental structure is divine I believe that's
(2:48:15) man-made yeah perhaps it is but I I guess kind of the point and core here is
(2:48:22) if you think that men and women are different I agree totally hang on totally agree wom are different hang on
(2:48:27) let me prot women it's not Divine masculinity I get it but let me finish my point and then I'll back to you if it
(2:48:35) is true that you think that women are different than men and I agree that they are private and that women aren't even
(2:48:42) equipped to have their ideas challenged they're not actually even equipped to have their ideas challenged
(2:48:49) why in the world would we ever let them lead a dog down the street no you're you're misinterpreting it we were
(2:48:56) not designed to have a man who does not love and respect us um so for example
(2:49:02) you don't know me from anybody you don't have any emotional connection to me you don't have any depth of understanding of
(2:49:09) who I am as a being so therefore I wasn't made to hold you accountable or
(2:49:15) you weren't made to hold me accountable you don't even know me your own wife should should be holding you accountable and putting you in your place if you
(2:49:21) need that just like my own the men that know me in my life
(2:49:27) that let's just say we have a soul connection those were the only men that
(2:49:33) I was designed to $100 she wasn't designed to admit when
(2:49:38) she is wrong this is her real issue she can't take an l and admit fault and will
(2:49:43) lash out put a one in the chat if you think her children should be taken away
(2:49:50) crazy we don't condone some of the uh messages that are coming through by the way anyway go on thank you for the TTS
(2:50:00) though we're not operating in a world right now that is going by the rules of
(2:50:05) divine Humanity shit's up so I am simply a woman trying
(2:50:14) to survive this yeah I understand that but I I'm I'm also saying that all the
(2:50:20) actions that you take are interconnected with the actions of the rest of humanity
(2:50:26) which do affect my life like it or not yeah it does affect my life true and so if you to say to me like look Andrew
(2:50:33) there there needs to be an interpersonal relationship for correction it's like that's fair but there is an
(2:50:39) interpersonal uh relationship for correction because unfortunately the millions who think
(2:50:44) like you affect me whether I like it or not they still affect my life I have never met anybody who thinks like me
(2:50:52) yeah yeah but the thing is is that they have women have political power women can move political go pul they can are
(2:50:59) they actually feminine embodiment or are they just masculine embodiments their
(2:51:04) feminine embodiments if they believe that having any of their World Views challenged any of their World Views
() 
(2:51:12) challenge is an assault on them because their feelings must be validated instead
(2:51:18) of the IDE idea that is very feminine in nature that is not that seems to be more
(2:51:24) in line with how women think than men think by your own admission so if that's true why are we allowing them to ever
(2:51:30) have a say against men who don't think that way well because there has to be
(2:51:36) this dance between the emotional part of being human and the structural or
(2:51:42) logical part of being human and so men and women were designed to offer this
(2:51:48) with each other okay that's why feminine energy or
(2:51:54) um women that's why we have this magnetism to us that men crave because
(2:52:01) we're so good at channeling the emotions of everything
(2:52:06) that's going on around us and L paladins donated $100 I don't believe that she has an
(2:52:12) active custody case she's under so many multiple layers of manipulation that I believe she would come here and like
(2:52:19) just about it prevent people from reporting
(2:52:25) her look it's not it's it's not a good idea uh even if you thought she was the
(2:52:32) worst person on planet Earth it still wouldn't be a good idea if you take kids
(2:52:37) from anybody's home even if you were able to do it they almost always have horse outcomes even if you left them in
(2:52:43) a home which was abusive they still almost always have worse outcomes not a good idea don't do it and don't push for
(2:52:51) it it's not a good idea it's a bad look for the show in in general anyway anyway go ahead thank you
(2:52:57) for yeah I'm not that's not what I'm at I'm literally just here to discuss the
(2:53:04) things in your head that's it just the things that are inside of your noodle and so that's why I started the
(2:53:11) entirety of our conversation saying look I want to tell you what my worldview is and get yours so that you understand
(2:53:16) what's in here and then I understand what's up there and then from there we can have some kind of conversation about
(2:53:22) those things I agree with you for instance that most people make decisions even men General decisions based on
(2:53:29) emotion let me give you some examples okay I really like trucks that are blue
(2:53:34) I'm not getting the blue truck because the blue gives some type of like extra
() 
(2:53:40) sealant or something it's There's no practical reason I just like that  color is that purely emotional
(2:53:46) yeah will it affect my logical decision- making when I buy a truck would I get some
(2:53:52) feature on you know that that that truck wouldn't have like maybe it's it's lug nuts or not the ones I wanted and I will
(2:53:59) kind of sacrifice that pragmatic thing for this emotional thing yeah right so
(2:54:05) I'm not operating off of pure logic I understand that or pure reason I get that there's emotion to the things that
(2:54:11) men do and the things that women do however you still have to be able to
(2:54:16) make a disassociation between the to when you're making decisions for instance if it was the case that I could
(2:54:22) not get the truck but only almost everything I wanted except it in blue I
(2:54:28) would take that right and so I feel like the distinction here is maybe you
(2:54:35) wouldn't that's correct because I guess I don't care
(2:54:46) about how something looks on paper I care about how it feels emotionally to
(2:54:52) me to live with that decision day in and day out right so if for example we're
(2:54:58) talking about the car situation I've done this before I have picked cars like one car on paper has
(2:55:06) better stats but the color of the other one is so pretty it makes me so happy sure so of course I'm not making a huge
(2:55:14) downgrade like I'm not buying a Lemon versus a certified but if it comes down down to like two certified Vehicles
(2:55:21) that's what I wanted anyway but this one has less miles than that one but the color of this one we do make those
(2:55:26) decisions and to be honest with you as a woman at this point in life that's how I want to live my life
(2:55:33) now because that's what feels good at this point I've lived the duty things I've gotten the degrees I've done all
(2:55:39) the things that I was supposed to do and what I found was that wasn't creating a sense of aliveness in me BBB donated 100
(2:55:49) you proved that you had prior knowledge she was mentally ill and you bring her on anyway nice that sums up the whatever
(2:55:56) podcast Brian you think it's a coincidence your audience and chat is so
(2:56:02) vile yeah so to answer your question BBB basically every woman that I see in
(2:56:07) modernity is mentally ill what makes her different anyway go
(2:56:13) ahead I mean I think I there was a point in my life where I
(2:56:18) operated more with my logical structures and I valued The Logical over the
(2:56:23) emotional sure but like I said especially becoming a mother and dealing with the gray areas before I had my kids
(2:56:31) I thought I had everything figured out I thought it was like a plus b equals c very linear you do these certain things
(2:56:37) you get this certain outcome but what I found in just getting older and having
(2:56:42) perspective different perspective is I started learning I got humbled I guess you could say and and I started learning
(2:56:49) you know what doesn't feel right it doesn't feel
(2:56:55) good and so I started leaning more towards following that internal guidance
(2:57:01) system that gut feeling that that sparkle that Pizzazz that
(2:57:07) that I I started allowing my emotions to thought out is what my therapist would
(2:57:12) say because I always was experiencing myself as very stoic um monotoned um
(2:57:18) they would say with my autism that was the presentation of a monotone like I did not
(2:57:24) have such a dynamic presentation or personality because I was so afraid of
(2:57:31) showing or following my heart following my emotions because I had been
(2:57:38) taught that The Logical mind was more important than the physical experience of the body and and all I have
(2:57:47) discovered is that it's at least equal we should at least be giving equal yeah
(2:57:52) I think well I think we have emotional responses but I guess and and we should we should have emotional response and I
(2:57:58) think that because the body doesn't lie but the Mind does so so the heart does
(2:58:03) too so in the heart only lies if it has so much trauma it's trauma respond the
(2:58:09) heart lies anyway here's here I can prove it to you I can prove to you that the heart lies and I can give you a
(2:58:14) great emotional example okay have you ever been with a man and he's given you
(2:58:20) butterflies to be honest no because I have S I have severe attachment traumas
(2:58:26) okay before the attachment traumas I always had them from the how did you get an attachment trauma before you ever got
(2:58:32) attached be do you not know about my family oh okay well absent this you
(2:58:38) understand most women do report a feeling of butterflies often they want they want
(2:58:44) that particular the the honeymoon effect of the chical reaction but that's your heart lying that's not your heart that
(2:58:51) is literally a chemical reaction in your body that's nothing to do with your heart space your heart space your
(2:58:57) heart's just a chemical reaction in your body no it's actually not the chemical reaction is coming from different
(2:59:02) structures in your body those are all chemicals though so if one's chemical they all chemical no your heart is
(2:59:07) actually an electromagnet it's not chemical it's electromagnetic you're okay in your body skin everything has an
(2:59:14) electromagnetic frequency as well but having a frequency for a thing does not
(2:59:19) mean that the thing which is introducing into your brain these emotions isn't chemical so here's the thing it's
() 
(2:59:25) actually the story that we tell ourselves that is creating the emotional
(2:59:30) response so those women who are letting themselves have that emotional response
(2:59:36) of butterflies that you're calling it that's actually them telling themselves the story that they have found a savior
(2:59:44) this person is going lying it's not their heart it's the story that their
(2:59:49) logical Mind Is Telling their body if it was purely logical right then their heart couldn't lie to their mind it's
(2:59:54) not their heart you're Mis you're misinterpreting what is heart could not you could not make what you're saying is
(3:00:00) actually unreason or irrational you're saying the rational brain is creating irrationality so you studied
(3:00:06) neuropsychology no uh the study of neuroschistosomiasis
(3:00:18) that I'm talking about literally I'm talking about it the philosophy of science is still a grounding foundation
(3:00:23) for scientific principles and so what I'm saying to you is that things still have to be rational even in in science
(3:00:31) they have to be rational that's what the scientific process in the method is is it's a methodology which is a rational
(3:00:37) method to come up to with empirical answers it's not necessarily rational so much as it is repeatable repeatable with
(3:00:44) an equation that's what makes it scienic but even that what you just said is rational but it's it doesn't always make logical
(3:00:50) sense the the outcome of the equation the outcome may not but the process to determine the outcome always
(3:00:58) does it is systematic repeatable linear yes it's rational so that's my whole
(3:01:05) point is like I just I just have so I just don't want the word rational to be taken out of context and spend into
(3:01:12) something well I'm not trying I'm trying I guess I'm tring a lot of the a lot of the physics of how the universe works is
(3:01:18) very mystical it's very like what the  I don't even disagree with that but what I what I was getting at what I'm
(3:01:23) driving here is from my world viw and the reason I was trying to give you mine earlier so that you understood what you
(3:01:29) describe to me as pure evil when you say when you say this and this is how we
(3:01:35) would describe it from my worldview when you say that the rational brain the
(3:01:40) reasonable brain should be rejected in lie of the emotional mind whatever the
(3:01:46) new emotional mind is right and that you focus on that emotional mind because it makes you happy this is the equivalency
() 
(3:01:53) to me of pure Hedonism okay and what that does is it subtracts this big
(3:01:58) element that I do care about I wouldn't care for instance if you went to a desert island and you're like I'm going to be hedonistic and do I
(3:02:05) wouldn't give a flying right my problem comes in when when emotion becomes collectivized especially in
(3:02:12) women and that creates uh some sort of like a power move and then that begins
(3:02:19) to sway Society or move Society in a way which causes significant problems to
(3:02:25) people who do value what is rational reasonable problems uh well I mean let's take uh
(3:02:30) for instance the uh inequality in the courts between men and women uh when it
(3:02:36) comes to custody when it comes to women initiating most divorces and the reasoning that they put behind re uh
(3:02:42) initiating most of the divorces has nothing to do with the fact that they were being abused or that they were
(3:02:48) being cheated on but that they have irreconcilable differences in other words they don't feel those butterflies
(3:02:53) anymore now we have kids who are brought into the equation hangang let me finish let me finish and I'll let you respond I
(3:03:00) promise now we have kids brought in the equation in these relationships and then what ends up happening is Mommy because
(3:03:06) she doesn't feel the butterflies anymore leaves dad for Chuck down the road who gives her the butterflies but now kids
(3:03:13) are we have these groups of kids growing up in a broken home if that was one family no problem when it becomes one
(3:03:20) million families it becomes a big  problem so let me ask you something what did the man do that gave
(3:03:27) her the butterflies in the first place was he an was he may not he may not have done anything necessarily
(3:03:32) Sometimes women know within 2 three minutes that they're extremely attracted to a man and that they desire him
(3:03:39) they're trauma bonded to him yeah you keep saying that but it's pretty loaded it seems like you think kind of think
(3:03:44) everything is trauma the table is trauma mostly it is I think so I think I when
(3:03:50) you say trauma I think you unprocessed emotion from childhood yeah no I'm going
(3:03:55) to disagree with that's really Freud so again who is the expert in Psychology yeah but that doesn't mean you're right
(3:04:01) who is the expert in pych if you had an expertise it wouldn't make you correct but who is the Expert Tech I'm not sure
(3:04:07) that you're an expert because you have a degree I'm not sure you're an expert I would not I would not make the
(3:04:13) claim that you're an expert because you have a degree do you just make the claim that people are experts because because they have degrees I don't think you
(3:04:19) would either that's kind of the world we live in you get a couple degrees in something and you are at least more
(3:04:24) expert than the person who has no education on a subject well hang on saying you have no education on a
(3:04:30) subject that that's not the same as a degree like there's a lot that I
(3:04:37) understand about psychology that I've studied that doesn't mean that I'm an expert all right Andrew but I'm not going to concede you are either okay all
(3:04:44) right well next subject then well hang on an argument from incredulity if yeah right we're not going to come an
(3:04:50) agreement when you're throwing me  I have a degree in Psychology so I'm an expert you do I I'm I'm an
(3:04:57) expert I have a degree in psychology degree I have a degree in Psychology does it make you an expert to have a degree yes or no what makes me an expert
() 
(3:05:04) is the fact that I got The Logical knowledge and then I went out and team can't believe you're enduring this
(3:05:10) unstable woman better than the others what are you afraid of I can't imagine
(3:05:15) what her ex had went through with this manipulative toxic woman there's another one coming through uh concealed man hey
(3:05:22) thank you man appreciate is this the concealed man is that a super popular
(3:05:28) Twitter account or am I thinking of else thank you though for Christin
(3:05:34) donated $100 LOL my sister has a psych degree from UCI and she is a she tells me
(3:05:41) she just memorized random facts and wrote papers for class and is now working at a newba driver take her kids
(3:05:49) away damn uh I just want to know the answer to that question do you believe that a person is an expert just because
(3:05:56) they have a degree no I do not okay well then you you continuously bringing up that you're an expert because you have a
(3:06:02) degree makes no sense because you do not respect my actual knowledge or experience on the subject doesn't sense
(3:06:09) get to French kissing bro open mouth and tongue too I'm dead # get the
(3:06:15) rocks #f free Nick # sleep8 to LP we we summoned you on Tuesday's dating talk uh
(3:06:24) it's been I think it's been a while right since we've seen LP yeah good to see you in the chat man thank you for
(3:06:29) the TTS appreciate it it is a Bitcoin though just letting you know um thank you man appreciate it good to see you in
(3:06:35) the chat man um it was so productive there for a few minutes
(3:06:41) too I do um you mentioned you have a you're going to sick your contacting the
(3:06:47) FBI on
(3:06:57) me are you asking me a question yeah that's a question how is it a question you're reading a
() 
(3:07:05) statement do you want me to put are you at the front of that is that what you're
(3:07:11) asking yeah let's just assume it was a question then okay repeat the question then okay in messages you said that you
(3:07:20) have an FBI contact and they're going to investigate me for terrorism correct um
(3:07:27) do you care to expand on you can just read it I explained everything to you detailed I mean I actually don't have a
(3:07:34) in front of me but Pegasus 25 donated $100 bimbo you're not an expert just
(3:07:41) because you have a couple thousand piece of toilet paper you're indoctrinated to believe the that you you're
(3:07:47) nothing more than a hook yes I don't really have it in front of me now but there were some messages
(3:07:54) that you sent about how you feel like we can talk about that off the show it's very serious
(3:08:02) matter okay but I'm asking you now like how do you come to the conclusion that
(3:08:07) the show is like terrorist it's not activities it's not something that I am
(3:08:13) comfortable with talking on camera what we can talk about it after for sure well
(3:08:18) you're comfortable enough to it was a private conversation it wasn't a public matter well hold on but
(3:08:25) when you're threatening legal action legal action will entail that it becomes a public matter well correct at that
(3:08:32) point correct at that point it will be discussed publicly then it's not at that point well I mean if you're threatening
(3:08:39) legal action I think it's going to be public eventually so why don't you just State
(3:08:46) the claim I don't see what I can't even imagine in what in what way this podcast
(3:08:52) could be deemed like a terrorist threat or organization are you
(3:08:57) saying Maddie's going to do something I detailed I detailed the
(3:09:04) explanation in my extensive messages with you well I don't have a screenshot of it well then you can go back and read
(3:09:10) it later I can't pull it up so we're here now you can just state in your own
(3:09:16) words what your specific my last word
(3:09:21) no next you can't just throw out an accusation and not be prepared to defend
(3:09:28) it I gave you personally personto person as a civil matter the claim very
(3:09:34) detailed if you want to take a minute and find that you're welcome to but I am
(3:09:39) not prepared to discuss that on camera live
(3:09:45) in this context it was a personto person
(3:09:52) conversation I mean it's not really helpful for the sake of the conversation
(3:09:57) but um okay well that's a separate conversation the whole terrorism thing
(3:10:03) uh what about your lawsuit you said you're building a legal case against me that's the lawsuit it's you're
(3:10:10) talking about the same exact thing okay what what claims do you intend to bring
(3:10:17) I just told you that it is detailed in my extensive messaging to you detailed well I'll make sure you send you send
(3:10:24) like walls of text and paragraphs it's in there not my fault you don't read it parse I don't feel inclined to like
(3:10:30) parse through your like incoherent rambling on Instagram why don't you're
(3:10:36) here on the show instead of like making us do this extra work to like go through
() 
(3:10:41) all the messages why don't you just State your actual position it would make it very simple
(3:10:49) I'm not comfortable doing that why are you not comfortable because my tummy feels very
(3:10:57) tense and tight when you ask me that and so
(3:11:14) pass uh well my tummy feels very tense and tight when people threaten frivolous
(3:11:19) and vexatious legal action it wasn't frivolous it absolutely
(3:11:27) is a frivolous okay have you have you consulted with an
(3:11:32) attorney on this why do you
(3:11:41) ask I don't know are you an expert in the law again why do you
(3:11:49) ask well I would imagine if you went to an attorney and said I had a bad time on
(3:11:55) the whatever podcast I want to sue Brian for $100,000 he's going to laugh in your
(3:12:00) face that's why I ask because maybe you're just imagining all these
(3:12:05) scenarios in which you think you can sue me yeah that's why I ask well why don't we
(3:12:13) just leave it at that you can think whatever you want you're going to anyway no matter what I say so what's the point
(3:12:18) of me saying anything I'm going to what whatever you say you're going to think whatever you want to think do you know
(3:12:24) what the purpose of a conversation is well in my day it was so you could gain
(3:12:33) perspective into another person's thought process but in the new generation it's really just so you can
(3:12:40) pick apart somebody's mind and decide you want to
(3:12:46) throw it in the trash so no
(3:12:53) point okay so you're fine with us pulling up the chats then yeah go ahead I have to go to the bathroom anyway take
(3:12:58) your
(3:13:08) time H okay it's interesting even though I feel
(3:13:13) like I'm being more I am I being more polite than Andrew not
(3:13:19) to say you're being whatever but she seems to actually be somewhat able to
(3:13:25) engage with you but every single thing I've brought up totally stonewalls me
(3:13:30) like refuses every single thing I've brought up just refuses to actually have a conversation about
(3:13:37) it I think it's your tone you got to learn how to talk to obstinate women
(3:13:44) Brian uh in any case I don't know you missed it but you just assume three things one they're lying two they're
(3:13:51) manipulating and then three that you can emotionally jar an answer that's the only three thing that's like yeah the
(3:13:57) three-step rule yeah um we have Jeff Bader electrical engineer here in my industry
(3:14:03) having a degree means you are a baby you need Decades of problem solving to be an expert y degrees are virtually
(3:14:10) meaningless thank you Jeff really funny is when you get um somebody who has worked in an engineer and field for a
(3:14:17) long time and then moves over to another field and realizes how little they  know about
() 
(3:14:23) anything it's pretty funny to watch but Engineers know this and Tradesmen know
(3:14:29) this hey Jeff thank you uh uh thank you for the uh message and
(3:14:35) then we did have Christopher Martin here uh someone has a PHD in gas thank you Christopher Mar attack donated

(3:16:25) don't think you have substance abuse issues no you don't do drugs I mean you

(3:16:48) uh okay well I mean if you don't want to discuss that uh you I mean you're welcome to
(3:16:55) read it if you wanted to read it that's up to you well I I could read it but if you don't want to actually like engage
(3:17:02) not on the show It's A Private Matter well it's not a you do realize lawsuits are private matters correct L paladins
(3:17:08) donated $100 Andrew I'd like to push back on the foster kids having worse outcomes the
(3:17:15) kids being removed are already suffering from the worst abuse before the state takes action skewed statistics yeah it's
(3:17:23) not it's not skewed so I remember diving into this um this was a couple years ago
(3:17:28) for a debate that I was prepping for and I actually interviewed somebody who was in um that's what they that's what they
(3:17:35) did they worked for the state and often times uh when foster care their rates of
(3:17:42) being on Al live for instance things like that or being sa are way higher than e even if you left them in an
(3:17:48) abusive home which by the way this has not been established that this home is even abusive so you're going I think
() 
(3:17:55) you're you're going above and beyond um the the heart of this
(3:18:00) conversation is to get into the worldview the ideas not for you to um
(3:18:07) you know to it's not a call to action and it should not be a call to action it should be us talking about the views
(3:18:14) that's the way that I see it
(3:18:21) okay so you don't want to talk about any of this stuff really I mean
(3:18:27) maybe we can come back to the thing that we were trying to get a clear answer on kind of before uh again I would like to
(3:18:35) ask how is the show or how are me and Andrew woman hating
(3:18:47) how was your relationship with your mother early on fine it was good how is
(3:18:53) that relevant well that why asking because it would tell us exactly
(3:18:59) where you're wounding around the feminine would be and then I could give you my mom's wonderful love her same I
(3:19:08) grew up in an intact family my mom absolutely adores me still does even
(3:19:14) when you're mean to she says I'm the handsome in the whole world yeah do you think if somebody is
(3:19:20) mean to a woman it necessarily means that they're doing it because they are a
(3:19:26) woman or can you just be mean to somebody for a wide variety of
(3:19:33) reasons that's correct but what I have observed is that the feminine what is feminine okay
(3:19:43) the the vulnerability the emotionality the the feeling part that we were discussing
(3:19:49) okay everything that is feminine I believe that that's really really heavily under attack right now so
(3:19:56) whether it's coming from a male body to a female or it's coming from a female
(3:20:02) body to a female there is this General ideology again that logic
(3:20:12) and egoic thought constructs

(3:22:20) idea to be honest with you that these online platforms were even I mean I have
(3:22:26) heard in theory what's going on but I had never taken part but I I have to say
(3:22:31) all that to say you guys basically because of everything that was brought
(3:22:40) up saved my children from a really bad situation that I have
(3:22:47) been waiting out for 5 years to the point
(3:22:52) where enough surfaced and my kids got old enough to speak and be
(3:22:59) heard that they got saved from their dad and because
(3:23:08) of his stupidity and him following along
(3:23:17) with the thought process of a lot of these people that are speaking Out Of Tune about what is abuse and all of
(3:23:25) that he shot himself in the
(3:23:30) foot so bad well I mean then you should be shouldn't you be showing them all gratitude and thank you yeah so that's
(3:23:36) what I'm thankful for and that's why I brought it up is I'm thankful that is my biggest so thankful to the whatever
(3:23:42) podcast yes I am actually and that's why I came back despite
(3:23:47) it being a extremely uncomfortable situation for me and I'm doing my best
(3:23:53) yeah I feel like we're making it pretty easy for you honestly and also and I even going to agree with you on
(3:23:58) something else when you say that femininity is under attack right I actually agree I just don't think that
(3:24:04) we agree on what femininity is and so I wanted to ask you this question do you think that promiscuity is part of
(3:24:11) femininity I think that's an aspect of it that's that's the wild like energy and that is a protective measure
(3:24:19) that is primarily feminine because you have to understand that if a male body
(3:24:27) was designed to Serve and Protect that means that there's a lot of
(3:24:33) death right because we're getting to you could say a more physically Humane um
() 
(3:24:41) era in society where most guys are having a life
(3:24:46) expectancy right that's like into the 70s they're seeing their kids be raised and all that that wasn't always the case
(3:24:53) so a woman biologically um had to come in with the
(3:24:58) ability to quickly shift between this guy this guy this guy this guy to
(3:25:03) survive literally I understand that from the purpose of mate selection that women can move from okay I was with a guy for
(3:25:11) a long time met another good guy right I'm with him for a long time I'm not not
(3:25:16) sure that that really resonates with promiscuity though when I'm talking about promiscuity I'm talking about um
(3:25:22) moving between sexual partners fluidly for the purpose of just self-interest in Hedonism it feels good I like it I think
(3:25:29) that's a feminine energy why is that feminine because and not like for
(3:25:37) instance a contrast would be Chastity when I think of of feet of women and I think of qualities that I consider
(3:25:43) feminine when I think of like chased and mind and this and that I put those
(3:25:48) together to kind of make the image in my head of what a woman is I don't think like powerful Panther sex energy that's
(3:25:57) like I think when I you're coming from a Christian ideology yeah well yes but not
(3:26:02) I all not always right I've had shakes in the faith things like this um and
(3:26:08) when I was in my early 20s there was no  angel right um well I'm sorry my
(3:26:14) yeah basically my early 20s so yeah the thing is is like I still have eyes and I still engage with the world and I can I
(3:26:21) tell even by talking with atheists and Men all over the world when they are
(3:26:26) creating an image of a woman they think of kindness nurturing Chastity almost in
(3:26:32) a way Purity well because they're thinking of how they're thinking of their mothers right so so the thing is
(3:26:37) is like um well I don't know if I would say exactly that that but I'm just going
(3:26:43) to kind of Grant it because I think it helps a conversation out but if they are right the most people
(3:26:51) are not going to want to men or women Envision their mother moving fluidly between sexual partners right it's embarrassing well that's why the sex
(3:26:57) falls off and women get bored of the men because you guys are trained to look for
(3:27:02) your mother but actually what keeps your bodies happy sexually is the so
(3:27:08) essentially you all are looking for the Unicorn who can embody the mother and the energy for you inside the
(3:27:16) I'm not sure that uh your wife sexually gratifying you would be
() 
(3:27:27) so my background was I spent 15 years in the church doing a lot of
(3:27:33) counseling what was the uh denomination primarily Southern Baptist okay so so you were a trinitarian I
(3:27:41) don't know what that means you believed in the Triune nature of God you weren't a Unitarian so you believed in the Holy Trinity father good the Trinity yes yes
(3:27:48) correct at the time so the reality
(3:27:56) was almost universally I observed a pattern going
(3:28:01) on in the church now I was part of the Southern Baptist denomination as far as
(3:28:06) educationally and where I actually went to worship but I went to many many different denominations and Ministries I
(3:28:14) traveled cross-culturally to Europe and things like that doing missionary work with the goal
(3:28:22) of what is going on with the women and the marriages because universally almost
(3:28:29) across the board the the census was women were not enjoying sex they were
(3:28:35) doing Duty sex right so I can think of
(3:28:43) literally one maybe two women in all my years of ministry and
(3:28:49) literally serving the women even the pastor's wives everything
(3:28:55) they were not okay sexually then how do you explain this because I've heard this
(3:29:01) argument many many times from various um uh well various women you don't usually
(3:29:07) hear it from um high level male clergy and usually women will say well of course not right they're trying to
(3:29:13) suppress women's sexuality but what we do have is we have some pretty interesting statistics so if you get
(3:29:20) married a virgin if you get married a virgin as a woman and as a man your marriage ends up lasting way longer than
(3:29:29) any other demographic in society it ends up lasting way longer and you know an interesting side effect when asked about
(3:29:36) sexual satisfaction those couples report the highest level of sexual satisfaction now the reason behind this
(3:29:45) right kind of like the the reasoning that people think that this is so is because the women have
(3:29:50) nothing to compare it to and neither do the men so for them the sex is always
(3:29:55) good if that's the only sex you've ever had it's always going to be good what's interesting about that though is there's
(3:30:01) so many women who get upset about that that these women aren't going out and
(3:30:06) experiencing tons of sexual partners even though by them not doing that they report higher sexual satisfaction and
(3:30:13) they stay married longer and are way more well adjusted so wouldn't that be like a good argument to move
(3:30:21) towards um you know Chastity or moving people towards virginity when they're
(3:30:26) getting married wouldn't that be a really good effect of that
(3:30:34) so that's all fine in Dandy if if we could create a world mhm
(3:30:41) whereby we revert back to the Natural life cycle that humans were born with
(3:30:47) meaning humans um hormonally um all of that are ready to
(3:30:54) have sex when they go through puberty so there was a time in history where that
(3:30:59) was happening so the idea of being a virgin when you pick your
(3:31:06) mate and actually being young enough for that to be practical
(3:31:12) right that would be possible if again if we change CH the whole school structure and kids are actually not being
(3:31:19) infantilized and they're actually transitioning from childhood to at least
(3:31:25) young adulthood instead of it taking 25 years if we actually brought back
() 
(3:31:33) Traditions um and initiation practices that many
(3:31:39) cultures have employed throughout the years initiation so for for males it
(3:31:44) would be one thing for females it would be something different but if we were
(3:31:49) advancing these children into sexual maturity to where they could be starting
(3:31:55) their families in their teens like their bodies are designed to do then I think
(3:32:00) we could in theory get back to a place where the and we teach people to be
(3:32:07) their authentic selves and to find Partners who are actually in alignment with the calling they have we're not
(3:32:13) teaching people how to pick wisely why I don't like the idea of women in
(3:32:19) political power and here's why because this was recent that most people married virgins recent clear up to the 50s and
(3:32:27) 60s most marriages were between virgins virgin bride virgin husband now that's
(3:32:32) wild to think about how that could drastically so drastically change until you remember birth control when birth
(3:32:39) control is introduced and the sexual Revolution happens the sexual revolution of women being told by other women to go
(3:32:47) out and be promiscuous and now they have a pill which will stop conception and suddenly this entire
(3:32:54) thing that you're talking about where you're talking about the initiation and you're talking about Society being
(3:33:00) turned on its head and kids being uh you know given the pill and this type of thing in school right women did this and
(3:33:08) so if you want to know actually I would disagree with that I believe that it was made to look like women did it but I
(3:33:15) believe that feminism is just the other side of the patriarchal coin where it is
(3:33:20) designed to separate men and women from each other and we see this going on there's this battle of the sexes wech
(3:33:27) not designed to do that but I agree with you feminism is the patriarchy what I'm talking about the patriarchy is how men
(3:33:34) can very easily for example you employ a lot of these tactics whereby men are
(3:33:42) using em the emotional vulnerability of women to usurp power over them even
(3:33:48) though that woman I hate to break it to you but throughout throughout culture
(3:33:53) throughout society and many different cultures elderly females were the
(3:33:59) highest regarded because right the the the matrons the oracles the grandma okay
(3:34:06) it's like yeah because they had a lot of knowledge a lot of wisdom a lot of Wis strong they were strong men's grandmothers exactly and their mothers
(3:34:12) Etc but the thing is here is like no I think the opposite isly true so I think that what's happened is women have
(3:34:19) utilized the fact that they're vulnerable and Men know that they're vulnerable to use that as a manipulation to achieve power some some you're right
(3:34:26) because otherwise otherwise why is it that when the patriarchy is in charge and everything is within a patriarchal
(3:34:32) structure the societal band seem to be much better and women are marrying far
(3:34:38) more pure and so are the men women are not happy in marriage in general that you I don't know where you're getting
(3:34:43) they're not anymore yeah but what changed feminism and the pill I I'm not
(3:34:49) a proponent of feminism is that what you're thinking well no what I'm telling you is that it seems like you're not a
(3:34:54) proponent of the patriarchy I'm not I'm not a proponent of either one because I think both structures are keeping men
(3:35:00) and women apart I don't think they're the opposite side of the coin I think that patriarchy so it's agree to disagree well I think that patriarchy
(3:35:06) I'm not even sure it's going to be agree to disagree let me let me give give you the view first because I don't think you're even going to disagree if you
(3:35:13) agree to some kind of natural law which it seems like you do LOL paladins donated
(3:35:20) $100 props to Blondie she has been cooking for the past 15 minutes absolute
(3:35:26) truth so when you talk about um patriarchy I don't remember where we're
(3:35:32) at um let's see oh yeah the other side of the coin
(3:35:39) no it can't be it can't actually be the opposite side of the coin if you believe in some type of natural law which it seems like you're alluding to you
(3:35:45) believe that there's some natural order natural Paradigm natural this natural that if that is the case then the
(3:35:51) biggest and strongest are going to have Force Doctrine on their side you're going to have patriarchy no matter what
(3:35:56) there's no way around it that's going to be the in other words the uh status quo
(3:36:06) well actually if the women all just decided that they didn't want to
(3:36:11) participate in the patriarchy anymore it would end in a day no I think the
(3:36:17) opposite is true I think that if men decided collectively that women couldn't do anything that that would end in a day
(3:36:23) and women could do nothing but if women decided that there would be no patriarchy if men wanted there to be one
(3:36:29) they couldn't do anything about it okay can you tell me how that logic has flawed because it's human nature to be
(3:36:36) driven by sex yeah but they could have sex with who with whoever they wanted to
() 
(3:36:43) if they decided to make women second-class citizens right well if the women don't want to have sex with them
(3:36:49) anymore how could they stop it not opening their legs how could they stop that I've stopped it many times don't
(3:36:56) your what I'm saying is that if men have forced Doctrine so take countries like Muslim nations for instance right if
(3:37:03) inside of Nations like this we can see it right this second if men decide this is why I think that men are benevolent
(3:37:10) because we could always do this but don't if men collectively decide that women no longer have rights and are
(3:37:16) second class citizens women don't have recourse to for they can't do anything about that we
(3:37:23) cannot engage with you anymore yeah we can just start our own Society then then how come in these nations where this
(3:37:28) occurs they're engaging with men because the world is still patriarchal we haven't all collectively come together
(3:37:34) to decide we want a new world order is that what you want a new world order yes of course yeah so but the thing is is
(3:37:42) like look um I still don't understand how that would negate that if men
(3:37:47) decided that women have no rights let's say m how women would have them well
(3:37:53) wouldn't they always misunder understanding because if you think about it women didn't have rights for a really
(3:37:58) long time and the whole society decided let's change the whole society didn't
(3:38:04) enough of society men allowed it okay whatever you want to say but I mean led
(3:38:10) men were led to change that I don't see it um
(3:38:16) basically courts did it people didn't really want it women didn't like it men didn't like it neither side liked it
(3:38:23) like for instance feminism the right the right to vote for suffrage let's say
(3:38:28) women voted against their right to vote almost every time they had a choice to vote on it and it was because they
(3:38:36) wanted to be seen as above politics they wanted to be seen as virtuous they wanted to be seen as Authorities on
(3:38:42) issues without being used as political pogs right or political cogs so that's
(3:38:47) why that happened and they they really voted so essentially the courts are the ones who
(3:38:53) push this through against the will of the people I do agree that to be honest with
(3:39:00) you I believe that the people need to start taking their power back I believe that we have all collectively given so
(3:39:05) much of our power over to governmental authorities that have particular agendas
(3:39:11) and at this point the agenda is monetary it's a business the government in the United States the court system the
(3:39:17) police everything it's big business it propagates particular agendas and it
(3:39:22) monetizes off basically Collective trauma responses because a trauma response is very predictable you can
(3:39:29) basically predict with very acute accuracy how a person is going to spend
() 
(3:39:36) their time money life force energy you could say you know you know sex you can do that with the most who's most easily
(3:39:42) propagandized wom women exactly and so why that's why women are being
(3:39:47) victimized yeah so then if it is the case that women are the most victimized by the state they're the most easy to
(3:39:53) predict by the state they You can predict them the best and propagandize them the easiest why do you want them to
(3:40:00) have political power because you I think your misunderstanding I don't want women
(3:40:06) to have have to have political power I don't want politics to be the
(3:40:11) overarching power of the world then why shouldn't then why wouldn't you advocate for women to retract themselves from it
(3:40:17) in a sense I am propagating that I'm propagating not in a sense but in as an overall yeah I am I'm propagating that
(3:40:25) everybody basically go Inward and start dealing with their own before they go out and try to save the world when
(3:40:31) they haven't even dealt with their own racism their own masculine wounds feminine wounds daddy issues mommy
(3:40:38) issues and then they're going out and they're basically propagating the things that they're saying that they hate or
(3:40:44) they don't want because they haven't really reconciled it processed it and
(3:40:50) reached a level of sort of development where they then so then nobody should
(3:40:56) engage in the political process I would love to see politics
(3:41:01) Fade Out yeah but I mean you're going to politics is micro and macro right so
(3:41:07) it's small and big you have politics in your own house correct and what we're doing though is we are focusing so much
(3:41:15) on the macro to the detriment of the micro so I agree I agree there but the
(3:41:20) thing is is that okay so let's look at the micro so if we look at tradition tradition is that's the exercise of of
(3:41:27) experiments that worked right that's why it's traditional these are experiments they worked over and over and over and
(3:41:33) over again that's what tradition is right that's why they're still running with bulls in Spain because
(3:41:39) scientific process because this was something which has worked yeah it's worked worked hang hang on I'm almost
(3:41:46) done almost done it's worked it's worked it's worked as insane as it seems to us it's worked so uh we keep them intact on
(3:41:52) the micro though in the family you know what's really worked really well for the family mom at home Dad working single
(3:42:00) income you can raise the but the thing is think about it Andrew we don't live in the same times our our government
(3:42:07) with the Taxation and stuff is not making it a safe environment right now for one man to even support a family
(3:42:14) it's they're for ing us with tax increases and expensive housing prices and grocery prices you have to have two
(3:42:21) incomes coming in but I would postulate that if women were retracted from the political process tomorrow that 90% of
(3:42:27) those issues would go away within the first year yes so I think that we can agree on this if we created a societal
(3:42:34) structure where women were valued in the home again rather than feeling pressured
(3:42:40) societal pressure to go out and enter the workforce and become tax
(3:42:45) because the the literally the issue of everything all of world problems is stemming from childhood Trauma from from
(3:42:53) children not having a sympathetic mother stemming from that but I'm looking at the solution regardless so even if it
(3:42:59) was if this solution helped you with that which it seems like it would you should still be advocating for that
(3:43:05) solution right but how does being sexually provocative having an only fans
(3:43:10) kind of saying things like this or liberating how in the world does that help move people past this um well for
(3:43:17) me I can't speak to everybody because everybody's sexuality is expressed in a
(3:43:23) certain way based on where they're at for me for example I came from deep deep
(3:43:28) Purity culture on one hand but also my dad being a pedophile and sex Southern
(3:43:34) Baptists aren't Puritans they can drink they can do all kinds of well no but I was in the Purity culture of
(3:43:39) celibacy so on the one hand I had my dad indoctrinating me that I was to be a sex
(3:43:46) worker that was the only way I was going to make it in life he would take me to bars from an early age and um I yeah I
() 
(3:43:54) can't get into that yeah but okay I get it I understand that there was exploitation in your ear but then but
(3:44:01) even then you're not listening know but I am listening I just want to ask a question and then I'm going to listen to
(3:44:06) everything you say as the answer if it is true that there was an exploitation right which is there which
(3:44:12) created this trauma vacuum for you which then is why you became promiscuous later in life I thought that your whole thing was
(3:44:20) dealing with and getting rid of those traumas so you have to understand with these extreme traumas primarily coming
(3:44:25) from a sexual wound from a parent that's the most extreme form of trauma that a human can endure spiritually
(3:44:32) psychologically emotionally okay so the only way to actually heal from that is to what is called reanimate the trauma
(3:44:40) but what you need to do is do it under your terms so that's why I had to get into Kink and BDSM so conscious Kink and
(3:44:48) BDSM meaning um bondage okay so that is actually a very powerful healing
(3:44:54) modality for these most intense extreme sexual traumas which I faced normal um
(3:45:00) you could say tame textbook psychological processes don't touch that
(3:45:06) depth of trauma you literally have to transmute it or you have to essentially
(3:45:12) um you have to take what was so traumatic and painful and unspeakable
(3:45:18) and you have to allow your body to turn it into a point of pleasure
(3:45:24) for you that is literally the only way that I have seen that anybody can
(3:45:29) actually heal from these That's How grooming Works um well literally what do
(3:45:34) you mean well because the the idea here is like you know inside of let's say
(3:45:42) certain churches priests have predilection towards people on The Young end right um but the thing is is that
(3:45:50) they're trying to make the association of this activity being pleasurable for you that's why so many of them end up uh
(3:45:57) you know going after same sex later in life and repeating the pattern is because that they they're kind of making
(3:46:04) the association with the pleasure so so Brian they're repeating the pattern because they're not owning it and then
(3:46:10) taking it into an appropriate context consciously so the way that these but you would be doing the opposite okay so
(3:46:17) hear me out let's use the priest as an example let's use a priest who is actually a
(3:46:24) pedophile and okay um who is abusing younger kids he the only way to heal
(3:46:30) from that depth of depravity we could call it the only way to heal that is that man needs to admit that is now part
(3:46:38) of his sexuality so if this is part of my sexuality How can I juste
() 
(3:46:47) no you're not listening they need to ad they need to admit to themselves the energetics what is it about this little
(3:46:54) boy that turns me on they need to get to what about we got to move off the topic
(3:46:59) but the thing is we have to because I'd love to get into this more though but we do have to move off on it I'm just going
(3:47:05) to say this this last thing I let let you give your last Point too right what you're saying is the opposite you're
(3:47:11) saying that if you make the association of pleasure that is that is definitionally grooming is making the
(3:47:17) association of pleasure to move towards an activity which you would not ordinarily do that's part of the brain
(3:47:24) hang on hang on that's part of the brainwashing technique for that and by the way the social sciences are very
(3:47:30) clear on that and that's why so many people young men especially who've had this happen to them end up doing it
(3:47:36) themselves to other people no the reason they're doing it is because they're never owning that there was part of that
(3:47:42) that they enjoyed no once they admit there was part of it they enjoyed and then they and then they Earth I'm
(3:47:48) telling you literally the process of how to heal this remember you haven't healed it in you I have I you haven't you you
(3:47:55) just got done telling me you're still experiencing the same exact type of trauma but listen I no longer let the
(3:48:02) trauma create a an chronic condition so traumas are going to be coming at us
(3:48:08) constantly okay I have exposed myself to particular being an influence having
(3:48:15) attacks being out there with myself and so obviously I'm going to have these attacks and acute traumas coming at me I
(3:48:22) have learned through my sexuality through Kink conscious Kink BDSM through
(3:48:27) being able to um express my exhibitionism to be seen in that way and
(3:48:34) to be allowed to just be a sexual
(3:48:41) being that is my healing because otherwise I would would go out there the
(3:48:46) the when I still had my rape trauma response hang hang on we're done we're done with this we got to we got to move the combo on I understand that you're
(3:48:52) not trying to use the words maliciously you don't understand how stringent the terms of service are for for these types
(3:48:59) of video streaming services they just don't want this kind of stuff talked about so I have to move it on okay trust
(3:49:06) me I I much prefer to just dive into it but we
(3:49:13) can't uh so I'm hoping we can perhaps find something to actually engage on
(3:49:18) here so I mean you mentioned something in your messages about ethical
(3:49:27) extortion yeah what's your question is that something that you
(3:49:33) engage in give me your definition of extortion it's the of extortion yeah or well you
() 
(3:49:40) use the term ethical extortion but what what does the word extortion my definition matter here well so that
(3:49:47) way I can make sure that I explain it in a way that you understand so that we're we're using the same the same word a
(3:49:52) word you used why don't you tell me your definition okay so extortion is easiest
(3:49:57) way to describe it is a blackmail situation right so you do this or you're
(3:50:03) going to have this consequence now unethical extortion
(3:50:09) is when you have no right to take what it is your black ing that person to get
(3:50:16) right so it's their intellectual property their money their whatever and they're entitled to that and there is
(3:50:22) nothing in the spiritual realm or moral realm or legal realm that would make you entitled to have that so if you do
(3:50:30) anything to take that from them that is unethical extortion but what an ethical
(3:50:36) extortion is is for example if a man comes to my residence
(3:50:43) and breaks in my home and I hold a gun to his head and I
(3:50:49) say get out of my house or I'm going to shoot
(3:50:56) you that's ethical extortion because I am commanding him to do something and if
(3:51:02) he doesn't I am going to hold him accountable to suffering the consequences of that action and that is
(3:51:08) ethical but that wouldn't be extortion but that is what I'm talking about when I'm saying ethical extortion
(3:51:14) it is simply holding people accountable and as a person person to person
(3:51:20) executing judgment on them because it's something that you're so sure is right
(3:51:27) before God you're just willing to do it and if you were in the wrong you're willing to suffer legal consequences
(3:51:34) meaning you're so sure that that person deserves to die you tell you mean in the case of
(3:51:40) your home being broken in well any case like any case where you have been
(3:51:45) wronged do you think that Brian deserves to be un
(3:51:51) alive there were his moments I mean do you think honestly he deserves
(3:51:56) that honestly I can't tell what's in Brian's heart and soul so no I mean what
(3:52:02) do you think do you think he deserves
(3:52:07) it only time will tell yeah but what do you think right now
(3:52:15) from what I can see do I deserve it I mean for sure I
(3:52:21) deserve it right well if we're just talking of what I know of you two up until this point nothing in the future
(3:52:28) nothing in the future I would say you are contributing to
(3:52:36) more Brokenness than healing and thus I would rather you not be here yes okay so
(3:52:42) if that's the case if you have declared much like the burglar to intend to do us
(3:52:49) harm then aren't we engaging in ethical
(3:52:55) ethical um what what was the word you used extortion correct aren't we
(3:53:00) engaging in ethical extortion by basically saying well now you do this or else because you're basically
(3:53:06) threatening to do everything in the world to us in as to and including um
(3:53:13) leading us down a road to being un alived if necessary because you think we're doing more harm than good wouldn't
(3:53:18) Brian then be the one who is conducting ethical extortion if he fought back
(3:53:23) against that he can try cuz eth I mean wouldn't he be here's the thing with
(3:53:28) ethical extortion it literally only works if you're right if you are in the
(3:53:34) right like when somebody declares that they're going to try to do everything they can destroy your life to the point that you un alive yourself don't you
(3:53:39) think that from their perspective they would say uh since you've made that declaration now anything I do back to
(3:53:46) you is Justified again you can try it but if it that's not my question my question isn't whether or not you can
(3:53:53) try it of course you can try anything my question is from the perception of the person you're declaring that to would it
(3:53:59) not then from their perspective be reasonable to say wait if that's what you want to do to me then any defense
(3:54:06) mode I have back you deserve it they would think that I would think that they would aren't you perpetuating and this
(3:54:13) is why Christianity by the way Superior to your worldview aren't you perpetuating the very same value which
(3:54:20) you're accusing the other person of violating yes and it's called eye for an eye you reap what you sow and so I don't
(3:54:27) believe anything would come of unethical extortion towards a person using ethical extortion if I actually wronged you in a
(3:54:35) way that was not compensatory to how you had wronged me shit's not going to go well for me it would go well for you
(3:54:42) then if it's true that you reap what you sow if you utilize eye for an eye against a person they snatch your eye
(3:54:48) then you snatch theirs so then therefore they go and they snatch your this and so you take out this isn't the entire
(3:54:54) purpose of breaking the cycle of you reap what you seow actually meaning this that if somebody attacks you and you're
(3:55:01) forgiving towards that person and walk away from it you are then reaping that
(3:55:06) down the road that people will be forgiving towards you the thing is is each of us as adults
(3:55:13) have the responsib ibility to hold other adults accountable when it what moral standard when it comes to the harm of
(3:55:20) children it's just a god-given responsibility if you don't have it you're not from God then what moral standard are you appealing to what God
(3:55:27) the god that the god that thinks you you should be a sex worker that's not the god I worship the way the god of
(3:55:34) creation uh-huh is a lot bigger than your ideology of it well what is it you
(3:55:41) don't even know what my ideology is or what I think the god of you just told me that God would never
(3:55:47) endorse sex work no what I well yeah that's true he wouldn't but I mean
(3:55:52) that's very clear that he wouldn't how is it very clear because he gives a commandment about coveting and he also
(3:55:57) gives a commandment about adultery what how did Mary get pregnant it was through
(3:56:03) uh Divinity so God her no God didn't her I'm sorry did God
(3:56:09) the Earth to make Adam too basically basically or yes
(3:56:16) over a long evolutionary process yes oh okay so no so the answer is no no the answer is yes no well the answer would
() 
(3:56:23) be no because that's not anything how how is that sex
(3:56:28) something infers penetrating penetrating one one thing that is structural and
(3:56:34) able to penetrate is then penetrating something else yeah you're just using the word penetrating a lot but not
(3:56:40) telling me how this is sex how did have sex with the Earth which led to
(3:56:46) Evolution because the consciousness of God penetrated physical matter so all
(3:56:52) sex is to you is penetration yes oh okay
(3:56:57) so I just had sex brilliant going to go have a
(3:57:03) smoke now okay um now that I've had sex he had he did penetrate that piece of
(3:57:12) paper a bit of a one pump jump but he did he did penetrate the piece of paper
(3:57:19) I do want to come back to so you said eye for an eye and you
(3:57:27) said that you think it would be better if me and Andrew were not around to put it
(3:57:36) lightly um and so you feel that's warranted
(3:57:43) because why well like I said I believe up until this
(3:57:48) point of what I know of you and I know of your platform I believe you are in a
() 
(3:57:53) sense doing more harm than good simple as that and so for this reason you believe
(3:58:00) that me and Andrew should be
(3:58:05) assassinated yeah or just not exist anymore because what's the point of you being here if you're not helping if
(3:58:12) you're not helping heal and you're not contributing any solutions to society
(3:58:17) literally why are you here I don't understand what is your point what makes you judge jury and executioner when it
(3:58:25) comes to determining the value which we provide Society I'm observing god I'm an
(3:58:32) incarnation of God yes I wish Andrew was here um you you are God you could be
(3:58:38) too if you were actually doing what God made you to do
(3:58:44) which is protect and serve women and children my job is not to protect and
(3:58:51) ser is that is your Divine calling and you're not doing it so therefore you're not in alignment with did you learn that
(3:58:58) at St Baptist your what was it the Baptist or what was the no I learned that from life well you said God the
(3:59:07) Christian God which God are we referring to the god of Life the creator of life okay the cosmos and biological matter um
(3:59:16) so you feel that it is warranted then that uh me and Andrew
(3:59:21) are uh deleted because we hurt your feelings no
(3:59:28) it's because I can't see you making any positive contribution to society maybe Andrew is different because at least
(3:59:33) he's I'm assuming financially supporting a woman and child so you can only contribute to society as a man if you're
(3:59:40) financially supporting women you can only contribute to society as a man if you are if you are serving and
(3:59:47) protecting women and children if you are not serving and protecting women and
(3:59:53) children then you are failing at at your calling as a man you're failing at your
(3:59:59) primary basic calling as a man is literally to Serve and Protect women if
(4:00:05) any woman is coming into your presence and you and you are genuinely
(4:00:12) having the mindset and the intention to protect her and serve her a woman feels
(4:00:19) that Brian we feel it so if we don't feel it then therefore you're not
(4:00:25) serving and protecting us and I don't see the point of your existence because if you're not serving and protecting you
(4:00:30) basically turn into a predator that is the most man-hating and mangous thing I've ever heard that if a man is not
(4:00:38) serving women that he is a predator that he is useless
(4:00:44) on its face that is like I said one of the most man-hating mandress things I've ever
(4:00:50) heard on the show again though so because you think or you feel that we've hurt your
(4:00:57) feelings and perhaps the feelings of other people you think that I for an I
(4:01:02) that violence can be done upon me and Andrew on this basis alone it's nothing
(4:01:08) to do with my feelings as an individual it's everything to do with the
(4:01:16) environment of hostility that you are promoting on your platform I believe
(4:01:22) it's very dangerous to society right now especially right now is it these minds are not the minds that we have in this
(4:01:28) generation are not the same as your mind and my mind when we were growing up do you think porn is good or bad for
(4:01:35) society I think that unconscious addictive um fake like acting porn is
(4:01:44) very toxic to society you produce porn I show my genuine authentic
(4:01:50) sexuality so I'm not faking anything I am not um I am
(4:01:56) literally TW twer on your Instagram you twerk on your Instagram how is that authentic and genuine and your I mean
(4:02:03) there's TW as a form of dance yeah there is no there is nothing authentic and
(4:02:09) genuine about the porn that you're producing have you watched my porn no I have not but I'm and I've seen your
(4:02:14) Instagram and it's absolutely degenerate what makes it
(4:02:20) degenerate it's you just look at it and it's just degenerating in your opinion
(4:02:26) okay there's many people that don't share that opinion right but despite your uh despite your uh conduct and
(4:02:34) Grievances and misconduct I don't think you should be unived for it but you seem to think that
(4:02:43) because people hurt your feelings they should be physically violently attacked
(4:02:48) you literally said it I didn't say it was my feelings I said it was because again I'll say it for the third time
(4:02:54) because it's not Landing for you obviously I said it's because I believe as a mother as a social
(4:03:01) scientist as a Healer that what I see you propagating on your platform is
(4:03:08) extremely detrimental to the society that we are currently operating in these kids didn't grow up with the ideologies
(4:03:14) that Andrew did or you did how old are you how is that relevant I need to know your generation so I know what ideology
(4:03:20) you came in with 35 okay 35 and 40 these  kids do not have the brains you
(4:03:26) guys do they can't handle this we have we have women of all ages on the show but you have to understand that
(4:03:32) your primary male audience is probably aged 18 to 25 I studied that no actually
(4:03:39) I mean looking at our YouTube analytics I believe the age range is 25 to 34 the primary male audien is 25 to well let's
(4:03:47) say you have 10% who are in the younger generation who literally the the
(4:03:53) propaganda and the brainwash and the lack of being able to at all handle a
(4:04:01) trigger okay wait I'm triggering the male audience I'm saying these young ones cannot handle this that you
(4:04:09) guys are propagating they handle words they can't handle they can't handle words they don't know how to critically
(4:04:15) think anymore so when you guys promote something and you are guys that they
(4:04:20) look up toast we talk about dating and sometimes it gets about culture war and political stuff but mostly about dating
(4:04:27) and we do we talk like I said culture Brian are you trying to argue or do you want to know why I am telling you I
(4:04:35) wouldn't mind if you disappeared that's what I'm trying to get at it's not something you can argue
(4:04:40) with that is my why I'm telling you I would rather honestly like it's your truth you're a despicable person to be
(4:04:46) honest okay I mean to say that you'd rather somebody even even the there's no
(4:04:52) there's no person who's come on the show and there's plenty of women who have uh
(4:04:57) who have done malicious things on the show uh I don't wish any of them because
(4:05:04) they're they nobody understand let meish when you're a  parent and you have children
(4:05:12) that you are literally watch in day in and day out concealed Man donated $100 you're allowing this psychotic
(4:05:19) degenerate woman to have her way all on you she says she's a mother and yet she wishes death upon you this is the exact
(4:05:27) reason why her child should be taken away 9911 uh thank you concealed man again
(4:05:34) really quick we've had a lot of women on the show some of them have not conducted
(4:05:39) themselves properly I don't wish harm physical any sort of physical harm or death on any of them but because me and
(4:05:46) Andrew hurt your fifes we hurt your feelings I'll say it for the fourth time you're insane it's nothing to do with my
(4:05:53) personal feelings it has everything to do with your I was looking at it from the perspective of a social scientist
(4:06:00) who is literally studying what the is going wrong with these kids because
(4:06:06) it's not okay right now and you think that's no you said he couldn't argue with your truth that is your
(4:06:11) feelings it can't be the truth fine if you want to call it my feelings based in
(4:06:17) the science right now sure based on the statistics I the
(4:06:23) statistics aren't telling science can't give you OTS the STA are saying science
(4:06:29) is psychopaths are getting younger and younger and but it doesn't tell you what you ought to do with that information is
(4:06:36) claims are not ought claims you saying science science backs up my a science can't back up your a a claims are not
(4:06:43) made science scientifically those are just is claims this is why should you be allowed to live what are you contributing this is true this is true
(4:06:49) what are you contributing to I I have contributed to the Next Generation and still am how what are you talking
(4:06:56) because I'm still raising it how are you raising them I have children are they allowed to twerk if they want no of
(4:07:04) course not of course not so you're children have to are your children allowed to get
(4:07:09) mured on their face like you do in your pics my is your child allowed to go suck a dick
(4:07:16) right now or is Mommy going to Pat him on the head and say good job sweetheart listen answer the question I just
(4:07:22) answered your that is genuinely where my children were at and their development
(4:07:28) and they were ready to take on those expressions of their personal sexuality
(4:07:34) I would do everything I could to make sure that they what's the difference between Des
(4:07:40) and a battery at least a battery has a POS side so the answer is yes I'm sorry
(4:07:47) that I won't let my uh my daughter my daughter's twerk I don't believe that
(4:07:53) children were born to be indoctrinated by the belief systems of their parents I believe that every child was born with
(4:08:01) their own thought processes their own um giftings their own callings in life and
(4:08:06) when you have a simple question when you impose made morals based on a certain
(4:08:12) cultural IDE I believe that's child abuse don't you believe all morals are made up I believe
(4:08:18) yes morals are manade but there is a Code of Ethics that we should be born
(4:08:23) which is manade also no ethics are coming from God oh so is okay so your
(4:08:28) ethics come from God correct do you believe that everybody should follow the ethics of this God you believe in I do
(4:08:35) okay so how do you get them to follow those ethics if they're doing the wrong
(4:08:41) thing for your God here's the the thing no the wrong stuff sorts out got to
(4:08:46) answer my question here what is your question so here's what I'm asking you specifically morality is just a human
(4:08:53) construct however the morals which you get from your God are objective and because they're objective everybody
(4:08:59) ought to follow them ought to right everybody should or they're doing
(4:09:04) something wrong right I I honestly I don't understand what you're asking are the when your God
(4:09:12) tells you what is moral this God that you worship well my God is more like here you're the God I'm embodying God
(4:09:20) okay you're embodying God got it so you're God correct okay so if you're God
(4:09:26) then everything you say is what's moral well remember I said I am not
(4:09:32) going with morals I'm going with ethics okay so everything you say is ethical
(4:09:37) yes I believe it is okay and are you going to teach your children that yes that's what I teach them then you're  indoctrinating children
(4:09:44) but here's the thing but here's the thing I always give them multiple ways to look at things that's really weird if
(4:09:51) if your ethical system is correct and it is morally objective and you tell your kids not to follow it then you're
(4:09:58) telling them to be immoral by your own standard okay I think that you have
(4:10:05) gotten to the point where you don't want to understand what I'm saying oh no no no I understand completely in fact I'm going to steal man it for you here's
(4:10:12) what you just said I am God everything which I say is ethical great so is all things moral come from you I think they
(4:10:19) do do you teach your children that system yes great that means that you are teaching your children what are from
(4:10:25) your perspective objective morals but you also allow them to move towards other systems if that is the case then
(4:10:32) you're allowing them to move towards immoral systems false I am not imposing a moral code on to my children but
(4:10:38) shouldn't you be if that is what's is moral no I am I am allowing my children
(4:10:43) to discover the truth of their own being because I believe that the ethics that
(4:10:50) are god-given are embedded in the truth of who we are born being and if you
(4:10:56) with that by since you're God can you give me your Ten Commandments the same Ten Commandments
(4:11:02) that are in the Bible the same that I should have no God above you well no The
(4:11:08) Ten Commandments you want me to make up a in the early modern period from about
(4:11:15) 1,400 to 1775 about 100,000 people were prosecuted for which craft in Europe and
(4:11:22) British America that's because they were conducting abortions um so so over here
(4:11:28) to this though yeah give me your five what are your five Commandments from
(4:11:38) God actually I think I wrote it in here just a sec God can't remember remember her Commandments I have a lot in here
() 
(4:11:46) trust me God is Not omnipotent and omniscient well not when being attacked
(4:11:52) per se God can't handle attacks he can but it's SL
(4:11:59) M God doesn't know he's supposed to talk in the
(4:12:04) mic God's Not Human I you said you're God I'm the I'm an embodiment of God
(4:12:12) meaning this body system little constricted into this yeah God's trying
(4:12:19) to move through me now I still have some restriction yeah because I'm in this
(4:12:26) human form okay so God is an external being God
(4:12:34) is life itself yeah so God is life would that
(4:12:41) make me God only if you are embodying life force
(4:12:47) energy I see you trying to stuff and deny a lot of
(4:12:52) your life force energy and argue with God and argue with God but but if I'm God then shouldn't you shouldn't I be
(4:13:00) able to do that if I want to and is that here's the thing here's the thing everybody has the opportunity to
(4:13:08) embody God that doesn't mean everybody does it and slowly over time I Noti
(4:13:13) around standard I notic by age 35 if you have denied your authentic self that you
(4:13:20) were born to be for up for 33 34 35 years I believe at that point you have
(4:13:27) literally reprogrammed your own brain to follow the morals or the trends or the
(4:13:36) constructs of the time rather than who you were actually born to be which might be a
(4:13:43) donated $100 if your children listened to your ethical worldview and came to the
(4:13:49) conclusion that God says they should follow the way Andrew and Brian live would you also wish your own children no
(4:13:55) longer existed fantastic question does the if your children decided to live the
(4:14:01) same way that me and Brian live by your standard wouldn't you have to wish that they weren't in existence yeah if they
(4:14:06) if they were to your ages 35 and they were still propagating this and I saw no hope that they were going to get it yes
(4:14:12) I would wish them not to be here anymore okay for the high crime of disagreeing
(4:14:19) with Mama no for not creating a healthy
(4:14:25) environment on the earth which is the only reason hum we're the only ones creating it I think that you're stifling
(4:14:30) a healthy environment for any human being on planet Earth personally but okay so I'll just try to think of it off
(4:14:36) the top of my head so essentially I believe that the code of ethics
(4:14:41) basically come down to this okay when we're thinking
(4:14:47) of anything we're going to do okay we need to now assuming the person is not a
(4:14:54) psychopath the psychopaths are those few people born just why would it matter if
(4:15:00) they were Psychopathic because if they're Psychopathic they don't have the emotional structures for this to work it
(4:15:08) doesn't work on them but they still would need to follow the ethical code right you could teach them cognitively how to do it you could I mean you would
(4:15:15) hold them to the standard of this ethical code that's all I'm asking well yes we should and if they weren't able
(4:15:20) to cognitively follow it you should take them out okay so essentially with
(4:15:25) everything you're thinking of doing you want to ask yourself these five questions and if you
(4:15:32) can't say yes to all five of these questions you're not making an ethical Choice okay okay so number one does
(4:15:41) this the idea of doing this or choosing this does it give me a greater sense of
(4:15:48) aliveness do I feel more alive when I think of making that choice right okay
(4:15:54) so that's the first one second one um is there good in this for other
(4:16:02) people so meaning is it basically like a win-win situation it's good for me and
(4:16:08) it's good for other people okay okay number three now and I want to preface
(4:16:13) to say good doesn't necessarily mean that
(4:16:20) somebody else is going to like it okay what's three okay so number three is
(4:16:26) um does it align with my core values okay okay so that vales core values are
(4:16:34) is going to imply that you have gotten to know yourself okay so for example some people are just naturally super
(4:16:40) into like animal rights you know and that's very important to them some people have kids and obviously PSA
(4:16:47) donated $100 this whole podcast should be a course on debate University on how to
(4:16:53) engage with people and keep a conversation going while getting no real answers to your questions appreciate the
(4:16:59) Super Chat what's for okay and then because I mean these
(4:17:05) are real answers what's for I'm trying to remember four
(4:17:11) is do you need help from a higher power to achieve this meaning the higher power
(4:17:19) could be your idea of God but it also could be a teacher a parent you know an elder a therapist just do I need
(4:17:27) basically do I need to expand myself and ask for help to do this okay and what's five and then five would
(4:17:34) be almost done Brian sorry it's hard to come up with that on the spot five would be
(4:17:48) does it require that I grow basically meaning does it take me outside my comfort zone okay required I grow so if
(4:17:56) everything that you do I believe and you get quick at doing this when it becomes embedded in who you are but everything
(4:18:03) you're doing you want to run through those things and you want to you want to say yes to all of it if you can't say
(4:18:08) yes to all of it you need to keep tweaking your plan because there's a better way to do it I just want to let
(4:18:14) you know by your five Commandments Brian is one of the most ethical men I've ever met so well then have nothing to worry
(4:18:21) about start with does this make me more alive uh yeah so every single time Brian
(4:18:27) does this podcast and according to the conversations I've had with him afterwards he definitely is having fun
(4:18:33) he's definitely getting into the spirit of things that's definitely part of this idea of aliveness you've described is
(4:18:38) there's good in this definitely receives hundreds of DMS from Men all over the world saying thank you for this this has
(4:18:44) been great it's been eye opening it's been very helpful to me three does it align with my values most certainly
(4:18:50) aligns with Brian's values his value of trying to do one and two in fact would align with those values uh he says do I
(4:18:58) need help from a higher power very interesting way to phrase it as Brian has been moving towards religiosity
(4:19:04) lately isn't that interesting uh because of this podcast in fact does it require
(4:19:09) that he grows absolutely and you can see from the growth of his channel you can see from the growth of him as a person
(4:19:15) when he first started to write now so according to this Brian the man you want to un Alive by your own Commandments is
(4:19:22) following your ethical system to the letter okay well then he has nothing to worry about but why should he worry
(4:19:28) about something from you when he's following your ethical code well you're telling him he doesn't need to worry so just tell him I'm asking you why he
(4:19:34) should worry if he's following your ethical code how what standard could you hold him immoral if this is your ethical
(4:19:39) Cod because I believe his higher power isn't quite as high as he thinks it is
(4:19:44) but he's following your ethical code right but his higher power isn't the
(4:19:49) correct one oh psss donated $100 and you're notes
(4:19:58) diabolical Hedonism good lesson next yeah I'm going to go get thank you check I'm good no I if you want to keep going
(4:20:05) on that I thought that was fantastic well she's getting up yeah okay lip
(4:20:10) gloss yes I I don't understand um what of the when you say
(4:20:15) higher power what higher power are you referencing that he doesn't follow that you follow I don't I don't get that well I
(4:20:23) suppose we'll wait until she's uh she's back we do have a message here Maddie
(4:20:29) can you read it people have an inability to understand that their sense of right
(4:20:35) is subjective no human on earth has the ability to be all right all knowing that's why we have voting brand Drew
(4:20:41) protect women and children by conserving true masculine values in Modern Health so anyway so Brian he you say he's not
(4:20:49) the embodiment of these values because of three which I'm sorry four do you need help but you didn't frame four as
(4:20:59) uh a specific God in fact you framed for and I took a cliff note here as you could be appealing to X you could be
(4:21:05) appealing to Y you could be appealing to Z you didn't say had to appeal to your specific God it's interesting that you
(4:21:11) changed the answer who now it has to be your specific God when we use your own value judgment and realize that Brian is
(4:21:17) living up to the very ethical standards you demand he lives up to so you posed the question in a little
(4:21:25) bit more of an understandable way before this when before I went when I was going to get my lip gloss you had said well
(4:21:31) then who is that God and I would say the God is the god of
(4:21:37) authenticity so the only reason I'm saying that Andrew has
() 
(4:21:44) basically veered course even if he's following all those things I don't
(4:21:49) believe that this platform and what I see the undertones of it propagating the
(4:21:56) subculture you could say um I don't see the subculture being coming from your
(4:22:02) authentic self so I don't understand this is really weird because all of these things which you have given us are
(4:22:09) a subjective metric and as I went through each one of them you couldn't give me a single disagreement for how
(4:22:14) he's not following everyone on especially when you initially hang on you initially gave us the do you need
(4:22:21) help which is a question as part of the commandment and then if you do you reach out to XYZ you even gave an example of
(4:22:28) something is a higher power not you have you have to essentially if this choice
(4:22:35) that you're going to make if that choice doesn't require that
(4:22:41) you basically tune in to a higher guidance whether
(4:22:47) that higher guidance comes from your own prayer and meditation whether it comes from you take a training course from
(4:22:53) somebody more expert in that area wherever it comes from talking to your grandma about life lessons whatever
(4:22:58) resonates for you but essentially that ensures that you're having the
(4:23:04) accountability to have somebody check you because essentially you're checking
(4:23:09) in with somebody something that you think how could you be held to more of an account than already following each
(4:23:17) one of these Commandments actually allowing your accuser to face you giving
(4:23:22) the accuser a platform in front of thousands in which to face you down and following the ethical system provided by
(4:23:29) the accuser to the letter how in the world can you reconcile that Brian bad guy when he's doing all of the things on
(4:23:36) the when you're talking about accountability for instance being held accountable to the world in a way that you're not daily
(4:23:44) he's being held accountable in a way that I'm not how do you figure because Brian has tens of thousands hundreds of
(4:23:50) thousands of people who tune in to ridicule every aspect of his life every single day across the entire world this
(4:23:57) is not isolated of the United States this is Canada United States Mexico South America um this is all over
() 
(4:24:03) Australia this is I mean there's probably in Antarctica on some station in Antarctica hang on hang
(4:24:09) on in a battleship somewhere who are sitting off the co was watching this  program and holding Brian
(4:24:16) accountable I could can't think of a man held to more of an account on the internet than Brian Atlas who is
(4:24:21) following all of your ethical systems and then when you say the one problem you have is there's no way to hold him
(4:24:27) accountable he's being held accountable by way more people than you are no I didn't say that I was simply saying I
(4:24:34) was explaining the reason behind why that
(4:24:41) number was accountability system and that's why it's part of a code of ethics that's all I was saying I wasn't denying
(4:24:47) and you know what I want to say this I what I want to say is what I like about ethical extortion as I called it is my
(4:24:55) words will fall flat if you don't deserve what I'm saying it wouldn't even
(4:25:01) that's why I can that's convenient I can threaten you because the reason I can threaten you is because
(4:25:07) if I do threaten you and nothing happens well then you just didn't deserve it yes true that's very convenient isn't it
(4:25:13) well you're doing the same thing to me how am I how how have I ever threatened you or said a word about you being un alived or the okay here's the thing your
(4:25:21) tone and the way that you um degrade me and every thought I have I deserve I
(4:25:29) deserve to die because of my tone it essentially is promoting the message to
(4:25:35) anybody who would resonate with that frequency of speaking to somebody it's telling all of them she's a piece of
(4:25:43) she's a piece of don't listen to anything she says she's useless she's
(4:25:48) dumb and by the way anybody who at all reminds you of her also don't listen to
(4:25:54) them yeah I would actually stand behind the idea that you are dumb and crazy and
(4:26:00) that nobody should ever listen to you but I have good justifiable reasons for why I think that which have been
(4:26:07) demonstrated the idea that I'm not following your moral system is laughable I hold myself to a way higher standard
(4:26:13) than what your ethical system is and so does Brian that's what's Wild to me and then it's like okay but what about being
(4:26:20) held to account not only is he held to account by tens and hundreds of thousands of people but he's actually
(4:26:26) allowing you to confront him right now how could you be held more accountable ever and you know who disengaged who
(4:26:33) didn't want to hold Brian Atlas to account you because the second he had an opportunity to engage and the second you
(4:26:40) thought oh wait I might be wrong you shut down you started crying you pouted and you Rage Quit imagine you being the
(4:26:47) person who could finally hold someone to account who fell short of your ethical system and when you get the opportunity
(4:26:52) you just start balling like a baby and rage quit I don't really believe
(4:26:59) that it's necessary for me to W Mountain donated
(4:27:05) $200 I have listened to every episode of whatever followed politics for years
(4:27:11) seen horrifying things in my own life I have never seen or heard such delusional
(4:27:16) horrifying BS in my life I just have to get a protein yeah yeah no
(4:27:23) problem darn that would that was a what what was the question you asked just right before that it was I said how
(4:27:31) is it when you finally have the opportunity to confront the person who you think is so problematic instead of
(4:27:40) actually doing the confrontation you break down and crying and leave because they disagree with why you hate them
(4:27:45) that just that's just nuts to me so there's so it's such a rare
(4:27:51) opportunity that anybody ever gets inside of these spaces ever to confront the people that they have a problem with
(4:27:58) in front of their audience on their Turf and yet when you did it you fell apart
(4:28:03) in 5 seconds if I can just add to that really quick I will uh I frequently will have people who make videos criticizing
(4:28:10) me criticizing the show uh criticizing Andrew they'll voice their criticisms on Twitter they'll make
(4:28:17) YouTube videos about it news articles whatever and I'll actually invite these people on for them to actually face me
(4:28:24) face Andrew and voice their actual criticisms and critiques now when I attempted multiple
(4:28:31) times to explore so you could hold me to account and hold me accountable for the
(4:28:37) ways in which you think I'm conducting myself uh inappropriately or poor
(4:28:43) when I've given you the opportunity every in every instance you've just shut down you hit your
(4:28:49) little no joke button or whatever so I mean I just have to ditto and Echo exactly what Andrew said here I mean he
(4:28:55) raised a well I'm in my counter argument the last thing I'll say on this point wherever you want to move it the reason
(4:29:01) that I believe that you shut down is because it was the first time in a long time you've been held to account for
(4:29:07) something and the second you get held to account well wait a I was here to just go after you about the court case that
(4:29:14) I'm in right now what about it what is that the one that the one that you just won and thank the entire whatever
(4:29:19) podcast even got to court yet we only have done the mitigation which is why had huh are you the plaintiff which
(4:29:25) one's that did you bring the case or did somebody else no that X did what kind of
(4:29:31) case is it the custody case I thought you said that you got full custody I have full custody right now
(4:29:38) because they're not safe with their dad while the investigation is going being held to account there's
(4:29:44) a because here you have a process in which you're being held the the stakes
(4:29:51) right while high are actually kind of low in other words you could have your kids taken away for from your buyer X in
(4:29:58) this instance right and I'm not hoping that this happens but I'm just saying if it did you could always say that had
(4:30:06) nothing to do with me that's because the court system was unjust and unfair it's because of this it's because of that you could make all of those claims
(4:30:12) much harder to make the claim when somebody else just shatters your worldview in 5 seconds and you can't defend
(4:30:18) it there's a difference between me getting emotional because an
(4:30:23) ego construct that I really was invested in maintaining shatters that's totally
(4:30:29) different that is not something that I do on the spot in a situation like this
(4:30:34) what you guys saw was genuinely Brian can read my rantings from last night I wasn't even going to
(4:30:40) come I was literally crying myself to sleep like scared but that's how you
(4:30:46) deal with trauma yeah and so I felt that I had moved enough of it out of me and
(4:30:52) he said Relax it'll be fine don't fret it has been fine well the only person
(4:30:58) who's falling apart here today is obviously well obviously I wasn't strong enough I cried
(4:31:05) because there's a lot of pain points yeah because you were being held to account for the horrible things that
(4:31:11) you've been saying no it was because again I felt
(4:31:18) that your points of attack weren't working and so they made you upset when there was a my platform and who I am is
(4:31:25) being grossly misrepresented you're the one representing it I am being pigeonholed into certain responses so
(4:31:33) you're a victim by you yeah in this situation so you're a victim I'm being victimized so wait a second so when
(4:31:40) invited on so that you could make all of your attacks that's fair but if somebody counter attacks which is what you say we
(4:31:46) should do because that's the way in which um what did you call it benevolent
() 
(4:31:51) extortion is done when somebody declares their intent to destroy you you have every right to hit back so when somebody
(4:31:57) does that after you declared your intent You Fall to Pieces that's just not
(4:32:06) fair what do you do when a motion what do you do
(4:32:12) as a man as a coping strategy perhaps how do you hold it together when you're
(4:32:19) when we hear something we disagree with we don't when something no when something touches your heart so
(4:32:27) deeply the the tears are coming I mean I don't know how do you do it what I do here's what I do more than anything else
(4:32:35) what I do is keep my emotions under control but how I'm going to explain how
(4:32:41) okay I have faith in the true God the the one that actually exists that God
(4:32:47) actually guides my life that God actually guides people's lives and there is a teeology a tilos a purpose I agree
(4:32:56) with you there that people do have men's purpose is not to yield to emotion but
(4:33:01) to control emotion because when we become uh enslaved to our emotion we become dangerous we become the
(4:33:08) people who are unhinged we rip doors off of walls in second we become super strong in seconds when
(4:33:14) you have adrenaline pumping and this type of thing in ways that are highly dangerous to society Society couldn't
(4:33:20) even function if men didn't walk around with an exemplary amount of emotional control and yet what happens
(4:33:27) is women want us to respect you for saying well wait I'm a very emotional
(4:33:32) creature and we're like yeah we know but the expectations I keep it under control my expectation is that you do too at
(4:33:39) least to some degree well the thing is though a woman's emotionality and what men typically call like crazy or
(4:33:46) hysteria or all of this stuff that we're hearing people call me that is actually our protective measure because we're not
(4:33:53) as physically strong as you so literally all we have is basically our acting like a be yeah so you're
(4:34:00) relying on the benevolence of men so what I'm saying is is your testosterone
(4:34:06) hormonally literally changes how emotions affect you versus a woman we literally can't do
(4:34:14) what you do if we do we start with our own hormonal you interesting I
(4:34:19) used to believe something similar to this until I started having children and
(4:34:24) I have adult female children and here's what's interesting I have seen so many
(4:34:30) times that the tears will get turned on in seconds for the purposes of manipulation under the guise of I can't
(4:34:37) control it or help it and then I also have seen instantly women shut this right off if they think that that
(4:34:44) behooves him so while I do think that women struggle with emotional control more than men and I'm willing to grant that I also think that they dive into it
(4:34:51) as a form of control over men trying to play against men's
(4:35:01) benevolentiae in my brain and it's like well but when
(4:35:09) it seems like your task to actually control them you seem to be able to unless it suits you not to that's the
(4:35:15) problem I have okay so your your daughters are the
(4:35:22) ones who gave you this trauma that oh my God it's not trauma no I'm just asking it's
(4:35:27) observation of which so you you mentioned your daughters which other women are you observing this in oh I've
(4:35:34) observed it in thousands of women I've had conversations with all over the world who I've seen utilize uh tears
(4:35:40) specifically for the purpose of manipulation how do you know TR to manate because later they admit it for
(4:35:47) instance I've had women who have made videos um where they've cried inside of videos and things like that who have
(4:35:52) later said look I did use that kind of as a tactic and leaned into it quite a bit this kind of thing it's very obvious
(4:36:00) so where where are you meeting these women do you have a a Channel or something like where a lot of them in
(4:36:05) person right here on the whatever podcast hang I'm trying to answer your question I've met a lot of them here on
(4:36:11) the whatever podcast but I've talked to thousands of them within Discord telegram uh Twitter all over the
(4:36:17) world I've talked to these different women a coach for women or how are you getting access I'm usually involved in
(4:36:22) group conversations where women also so you have a group you got to let me answer I'm usually involved in group
(4:36:29) conversations where do they start from like a church usually they no usually they'll start on a place like Twitter
(4:36:34) maybe there'll be a space I'm trying to answer your question so usually they'll start with two or three people and then
(4:36:41) hundred of people will begin to move into okay try and answer then you can ask then hundreds of people will move
(4:36:48) into these groups and yes sometimes the groups will fracture you'll have five six different people talking uh so yeah
(4:36:54) I have discussions with women all over the world all the time and half for years but I'm I'm not understand they're
(4:36:59) coming to like your Twitter and leaving comments and that's how you're finding them I'm not understand a Twitter Liv space or a Discord Liv space or a
(4:37:07) YouTube Liv space or places like this so you're just leaving a comment on somebody else's video and then no I'm
(4:37:13) voice chatting with them like I am with you right now okay we're talking like we're on the phone like we're on the
(4:37:19) phone I'm sorry I just am not up with the technology or like what people are doing so I'm just trying to put it into
(4:37:24) context think of them like group calls that you start or yes that I start so you start it and then these women where
(4:37:33) are they coming from I just don't understand how they're find all over the Internet because I'm a really popular internet personality so when I host
(4:37:39) faces and things like this inside popular platforms lots of people want to come in and listen to them because like
(4:37:45) you have your own cult following I wouldn't say it's a cult following I have like how we call like C class if
(4:37:51) you're talking about like um from the observation of a cult of personality sure but if you're talking about it from
(4:37:57) the observation of like a religious cult AB no I'm not talking about that I'm just talking about you have a fan base
(4:38:04) of people who enjoy um your thought haters or haters
(4:38:09) okay so I have fans and haters alike and I've and I've talked with both extensively okay and you're saying that
(4:38:15) based on the observations in both my personal life and then external life including in the workplace including in
(4:38:21) many different Avenues I have seen that women very often can have emotional
(4:38:26) control but get a pass for not having emo your like that no was is your wife like that nope your first wife no what
(4:38:34) do you mean my black first ex-wife she was black
() 
(4:38:40) apparently anyway way so the thing is is like no nobody nobody really CL first of
(4:38:46) all um I wouldn't marry my wife if she was like that second of all um no of
(4:38:53) course my mom wasn't like that my dad would have governed her behavior very quickly but it is something that you see very commonly in women do you do you
(4:39:02) want it observation no I know I get it I get it I'm just asking is there part of
(4:39:08) you that is longing my God for that not to be thee would you enjoy a world in which women
(4:39:14) were no longer us yes where women were no longer using emotional yes the world
(4:39:21) world would be better if women would not would would stop doing like what you did earlier and trying to utilize emotions
(4:39:28) try to utilize emotions or not even maybe really having as defens you are now in my presence telling me what my
(4:39:37) motivation was for having an emotional experience now pretty interes how EAS you can turn
(4:39:44) the Waterworks on and how easily you turned them off yeah I'm a woman okay I literally have exctly I have kids so you
(4:39:50) have to understand I have got I have become a master at having my minute manipulation no it's a master at we
(4:39:56) don't have time to have a full breakdown right now honey you got to like just let out enough of the pressure to like hold
(4:40:03) your together and then we got to get back to doing what we were doing honestly it's a it's a mom thing when I
(4:40:08) was younger I would have had a full break break down and like I used to pass out a lot that's how my body or I would
(4:40:14) feel sick to my stomach that's how my body would take me out of the situation for a long period of time okay it's so
(4:40:21) none of that was emotional manipulation the truth no I Pro I'm autistic so then sticking your ass in my face was not
(4:40:28) supposed to be emotional manipulation I was trying to get I was trying to yes I was trying to sh the vibe I wanted us to
(4:40:35) have a funner time so you were trying to do emotional manipulation that time I was that time I was but when I actually cried because that is the time I can
(4:40:42) hold you to account with an example you cannot refuse but that doesn't mean that these other things that you're saying
(4:40:48) they're not great examples of it just because I can't give it such an obvious representation that there's no way for
(4:40:55) you to refute it so you have to admit it doesn't mean that that's not what's been going on well I just want you to know that it
(4:41:03) is my honest truth that the crying part was genuine emotion coming through and
(4:41:09) honestly I I was on the fence about even coming I wasn't sure I could handle it
(4:41:15) and I was having moments where I was like okay I can't handle this I thought I was like stronger than I am well I
(4:41:22) mean that was that the ass thing was me trying to like it's sexually batter me
(4:41:27) no I would just rather have a good time I would rather just us talk about fun topics without it having to be like your
(4:41:34) opinion has to Trump mind yeah yeah but that that wasn't even really how it started the first sets of questions
(4:41:41) weren't even really revolving around debate but just trying to get an understanding of how you think now that
(4:41:46) we understand how you think we got to the point where you're making accusations that and you you said all
(4:41:52) these horrible things you're being held to account for the horrible things you you were saying that's when you started crying that's why I think that it might
(4:41:59) be a tactic for emotional manipulation the second you were being held account to to account for I said all kinds of
(4:42:05) horrible things to you guys which maybe weren't even Justified but just based on my feelings now I'm using I'm going to
(4:42:11) turn on the Water Works right okay so let's just be clear you both believe
(4:42:16) that I am a liar it's just as simple he does it's just as simple as that okay so Andrew believes I'm a liar do you
(4:42:22) believe I'm a liar I don't really see how this is relevant but it's relevant because we can just cut to the chase if
(4:42:28) you both believe I'm a liar then it doesn't matter what I say you're not
(4:42:33) going to respect it you're going to always say that I cried to manipulate you because you believe I'm a liar so
(4:42:40) what what would be the point defending that there's no point it's it's a m it's a it's a null and void issue just move
(4:42:47) on I believe I've caught you in multiple lies and you're a manipulator yes I do believe that but that's only based on my
(4:42:53) experience with you in the last few hours we've been
(4:42:59) here I do have a question a couple things I want to hit on here you said that the justification for why you think
(4:43:06) me and Andrew should cease to exist is because we are propagating certain things certain negative things I
(4:43:14) suppose at least in your from your perspective can you articulate precisely
(4:43:19) what it is we are
() 
(4:43:36) propagating I mean I have shared explicitly with you throughout messages
(4:43:42) so I would like to actually gauge your concern and active listening to the
(4:43:49) extensive explanations and messages I've sent so I would you think I've committed your walls of texts and paragraphs to
(4:43:56) memory why are you why don't you just instead of wasting time instead of saying why Brian you just do the work
(4:44:02) and go through the like literally not the novel of text you've sent me and you
(4:44:08) can outline just give me three things that me and Andrew are propagating and it'll take you maybe 30 seconds to say
(4:44:15) it it's very complex issues hence why I wrote you so much huh I
(4:44:21) mean that I think you're just obfuscating here you're just you can't
(4:44:27) even articulate it this is it's a it's it's a even a fallacious thinking pattern because it's the fallacy of
(4:44:33) irreducible complexity so the way that this is fallacious thinking in of itself is to say I cannot explain this to you
(4:44:40) because it's so complex Lex it it has too many variables cannot be reduced down to um you know these other things
(4:44:46) but every premise every thought everything in existence which I can see starts with some principle some core
(4:44:53) aspect of itself that we can reduce it down to to some degree that we can even understand it so I think I don't know
(4:45:02) I'll exit the combo let you guys talk but it just seems like it's uh it's it's flous thinking well you're welcome to
(4:45:09) stay yeah but I want to have a oh okay all right um so again out for a while I
(4:45:15) do want to um can you try to articulate what we are
(4:45:26) propagating
(4:45:32) hostility okay hostility sure that's one okay what else
(4:45:41) honestly that sums it up hostility we're hostile yeah how do you
(4:45:48) define hostility having the intention of
(4:45:56) creating Discord for the purpose of
(4:46:01) extorting something from that Discord meaning gaining off of the
(4:46:16) atmosphere that you're creating okay so due to the perceived hostility of myself and Andrew and this
(4:46:23) podcast you think that that is enough pretext for us to
(4:46:30) be uh ceasing to exist well if we
(4:46:36) were two generations ago I would say you guys are fine it's no different than MMA
(4:46:42) fighting or all this stuff that guys do who cares but because of the
(4:46:52) particular um propaganda being indoctrinated into the youth right now
(4:46:59) specifically I don't believe they're
(4:47:04) psychologically able to handle what this show is propagating
(4:47:11) at large live conversations among consenting adults who are who have a
(4:47:18) wide variety of World Views and opinions we'll have liberal women we'll have conservative women we'll have moderate
(4:47:25) women on the show sometimes I'm not even involved in the disagreements there'll be a conservative
(4:47:31) girl going after a liberal girl a liberal girl going after conservative girl um I don't see how that is in any
(4:47:38) way damaging what whatsoever uh also if you have some
(4:47:44) objection to this you know I have relatively speaking in the grand
(4:47:49) scheme of things fairly little influence compared to for example the Goliath that
(4:47:56) is you know if you want to talk about uh propaganda the Goliath that is
(4:48:02) institutions like the university system in this country sorry I'm just checking on with
(4:48:07) my kids cuz it's past eight sorry okay so okay why aren't you like you know I have
(4:48:14) a fairly small audience you there's massive systems out there that have hold on there are massive systems out there
(4:48:21) in the United States that have that have power that far exceeds mine that has
(4:48:26) influence that far exceeds mine for example you look at the University system every single University system in
(4:48:32) this country is steeped in feminism feminism has its Clause not just in the University system these are institutions
(4:48:39) systems journalism Media news government corporation hold on feminism has its
(4:48:46) clause in all of these institutions and systems I have a I am independently
(4:48:52) funded by myself and I have some very generous contributors you know who watch the show fan
(4:48:58) funding when compared to if we just look at the University we remove corporations we remove news media government we look
(4:49:06) at the University system they have billion dollar endowments and all of
(4:49:12) them have feminist study programs women studies program gender study program and
(4:49:18) the the enrollment rate there's millions and millions of women and men in these
(4:49:24) University systems that are indoctrinated by these very systems so
(4:49:29) you think because I have a somewhat entertainment focused dating podcast that sometimes gets into feminism
(4:49:37) politics culture War stuff that this is a more I feel like got bigger fish to
(4:49:42) fry you think that this is no you're right this is your Crusade Brian it's
(4:49:47) simply because I personally bumped up against you that's the only reason that and did
(4:49:53) you ask to be on the show did we reach out to you or did you reach out to us I
(4:49:58) did and I have to believe that there was a reason why so that you can what's the reason why won you tell
() 
(4:50:05) me I just think that I was drawn to you because I could
(4:50:10) see your aliveness you could say I could see isn't that one of your uh mhm that's
(4:50:17) one of her commandments so so you interest me is the point you
(4:50:23) interest me and I was interested in giving you the opportunity
(4:50:33) to shift things just a little bit just shift things to a little bit more of a
(4:50:42) a fair discussion where it's not like this energy of you two as being the
(4:50:49) professionals at everything but just like a genuine this is my perspective
(4:50:54) this is your perspective it's not necessarily the perspective of the show but it's just when you when you create
(4:51:00) this hostile environment with all these women you create polls who's the good girl who's the one everybody likes and
(4:51:07) you play on all of their traumas essentially
(4:51:12) you put women into that kind of hysterical emotional place and then you guys you are not affected by that so
(4:51:19) then they're trauma responding they're turning against each other and you two are just and this is why everybody loves
(4:51:28) this and not this and it's just the young minds can't see through that they can't see that there's an agenda behind
(4:51:34) that I would have actually have been happy to have engaged in the beginning
(4:51:39) of this conversation by doing exactly what you're now saying
(4:51:44) to do to have a free flow conversation based on worldview paradigms so that you
(4:51:49) can understand where I was coming from why I think what I think and I can understand where you're coming from and
(4:51:56) why you think what you think and then you could have come up with that idea that you have here of a solution where
(4:52:02) it's not pitting people against each other this and that but try to think of the adversarial nature of just asking
(4:52:08) some of these women basic questions about what it is they believe and how defensive they become there's six of them one of me
(4:52:17) seven of them eight of them one of Brian and so it it seems that we're to always
(4:52:23) have an unfair advantage while everybody around us is to always have some type of advantage over us it's a very bizarre
(4:52:31) Dynamic which is requested uh versus when the tables are turned and it's like
(4:52:37) okay well I'll meet you where you want we can talk about the World Views I'd like for you to actually see why I think
(4:52:42) what I think because I can justify a lot of it it would make a lot of sense you go nah but the thing is again I'll just
(4:52:50) repeat it's because it's not that I'm not interested in your worldview I believed I already had enough of the
(4:52:57) information I didn't believe that you were going to share with me anything about your worldview that I didn't already know you going to have a so then
(4:53:03) how can your criticism of Brian who said you say you're going to be the authority
(4:53:09) on it you're going to say this is why people like this and don't like that right you're giving him a knowledge
(4:53:15) claim you're saying you don't know that though Brian you don't know that these other people don't know these other
(4:53:21) things the very first assumption you make I already know your worldview don't worry about it yeah I guess like I said
(4:53:28) maybe my toxic trait is psychologically profiling people and making judgments
(4:53:34) before I even let them speak because I just noticed over time that people are
(4:53:40) are literally full of so I guess at including including you honestly I just spew it like I see
(4:53:47) it and sometimes it sounds crazy to other people because they don't have my  mental illness going on that I
(4:53:54) do and so wait what mental illness the mental illness of my obsessiveness about
(4:54:02) very particular things so it makes me weird it makes me freak savantism yes so
(4:54:07) the thing is is uh so psychological profile in is interesting in the fact that it's highly ineffective generally
(4:54:14) because it's very difficult to apply over a broad birth even if you're looking for specific things that's why
(4:54:20) you can psychologically profile what a serial killer would be but very
(4:54:26) difficult to apply to find one well I was raised by one so I mean
(4:54:33) maybe but your psychological profiling is not the thing which identifies the
(4:54:39) thing is we can call it autism in me or we can call it just the extreme trauma of having to survive in conditions that
(4:54:48) no child or human was ever designed to survive wild
(4:54:54) donated I'm Sor green monster was in Boston at Fenway Park but nope it snuck into Santa Barbara at the whatever

() 
(4:55:45) ever like change our mind on anything but I mean we've tried to
(4:55:51) uh Christen $100 question for desire in what fashion
(4:55:57) would you want your children to be unived shot drowned run over by a car
(4:56:03) thrown off a cliff surely you have a preference for disagreeing with you this
(4:56:08) is in response to you saying that if your children conducted themselves in the way that if they became us
(4:56:17) sociopaths or Psychopaths and we're creating um harm to society yo Ace thank
(4:56:23) you for the gifted 20 Subs sorry I had the alerts pause there accidentally for a bit go ahead
(4:56:31) sorry uh you said even your own children if they were like me and Andrew you if
(4:56:38) my children presented as psychop PA or sociopaths and got to the level of
(4:56:44) creating more societal harm than could be contained then yes I would not want
(4:56:52) them here anymore I mean and do you think me and Andrew are
(4:56:59) on that level of societal harm I'm still discovering that why
(4:57:07) don't you tell us what you actually think well remember I had said if we were just
(4:57:12) discussing it up until this point but there's still a lot Beyond this point so
(4:57:19) I do have a corner of my mind open to the possibility that you are not as bad
(4:57:25) as I'm thinking and perhaps I'm just really misunderstanding and could be wrong I don't think you're
(4:57:32) going to walk away from this podcast Having learned anything I think you're going to just dig your heels in you're
(4:57:37) going to continue your you know your train of thoughts on these matters uh you're going to continue
(4:57:44) threatening frivolous and Vex vexatious legal action against me and kit actually
(4:57:49) on that topic really quick um would would you in an effort to get uh to be
(4:57:55) vindictive and get revenge on somebody Kristen ated
(4:58:00) $69 she didn't answer the question does she prefer they get shot drowned thrown
(4:58:06) off a cliff light them on fire run them over a car or ET Etc let clip this and
(4:58:11) show this to CPS TTS is 69 your
(4:58:17) answer lethal injection would be the most um
(4:58:22) Humane an UND donated $100 reviewed in the United States on
(4:58:28) August 2nd 2024 warning this book may cause you to lift your dress and sexually assault to man you because you
(4:58:35) feel disrespected by his words 45 people found this help
(4:58:41) uh really quick I guess uh to go back to my question thank for the TTS there and on um so if you
(4:58:48) felt either perceived a real um if if somebody
(4:58:53) uh you feel like you had a grievance against somebody uh do you think it
(4:58:58) would warrant bringing a vexatious lawsuit so I'll just Define
(4:59:04) vexa uh denoting an action or the bringer of an action that is brought without sufficient grounds for winning
(4:59:11) purely to cause annoyance to the defendant no I don't do that I only
(4:59:17) pursue things that I'm very serious about right so what so are your legal threats empty or do you actually intend
(4:59:23) to file the lawsuit against me well I have to see
(4:59:28) if this episode actually makes restitution
() 
(4:59:33) for the custody situation that I'm in because I need I to show the court that
(4:59:39) I was not supporting or in agreement with the way that I was portrayed on the
(4:59:47) last episode so I have to do something one way or the other it's literally just a formality so this show might very well
(4:59:54) clear the air by however it goes okay so that might be fine if that's fine I have
(5:00:01) no reason to pursue anything I just want to be done with it I think I understand you're saying you're saying if you can show the
(5:00:07) court that you're suing because you were you weren't portrayed correctly that the court will then be
(5:00:14) more lenient towards you or in some way see your see your case better but
(5:00:21) literally if that is true then what you're then what you're saying is Brian I will sue you out of the convenience of
(5:00:28) self-interest so that I look better in my personal life for this thing that's going on in my person how is that how
(5:00:34) does that follow no it's because literally the this is the way it works if I nashun
(5:00:41) NAU donated $100 if all of your children came to the conclusion that God wanted them to live
(5:00:47) like Andrew or Brian wouldn't that mean God sides with them over you would you be worthy of uning at that point I'm
(5:00:54) going to pause the TTS temporarily so she can respond go ahead thank you what am I responding yeah so the so the thing
(5:01:01) is is you just laid out that essentially you would sue Brian for the purposes of
(5:01:06) being able to prove to the court that you were portrayed incorrectly so this would be completely self-interest in
(5:01:13) your personal life so you might not think Brian actually deserves it but that you it would actually be in the
(5:01:18) interest of my children not myself yeah but but what about the harm that that would do to Brian who I can't
(5:01:27) I cannot be worried about a grown ass man and the consequences he might have out in the business world I'm only
(5:01:33) responsible for taking care of myself and my children if I need to if I need
(5:01:38) to make a move move that might fall unfavorably on Brian in order to protect me and my children yes I'm going to do
(5:01:45) it and I feel Justified doing that even if it wasn't Justified again I am only responsible
(5:01:53) for my children number one and then obviously myself has to be here to be
(5:01:58) able to take care of the children so so you'll a you'll a person over specifically to for the betterment of
(5:02:05) your children now if the show didn't go the way that it did I would never be in this position in the first place but I
(5:02:12) was portrayed in a certain light how were you portrayed because the show is
(5:02:18) live nothing is cut nothing is edited yeah it's all there to see but and
(5:02:23) that's the thing is the the idea of portrayal in a certain light what if you if if you actually were portrayed in a
(5:02:31) way that you acted so it was you were portrayed fairly but even knowing you were
(5:02:37) portrayed fairly you thought that this would have negative ramifications on your kids if you didn't sue would you
(5:02:43) still Sue say it again even if you thought you were portrayed fairly if the court
(5:02:51) thought that that looked bad right would you still Sue because that would do well
(5:02:57) by your kids even if you thought you were portrayed fairly so it looked bad but you thought
(5:03:04) if I really no no no if I really believed that that was an accurate portrayal of who I am as a person M even
(5:03:10) if the court was like what the is this I would not hold Brian accountable for that the only reason I would stand
(5:03:17) up against it to hold anybody accountable or at least to make a stand that I am at least attempting to hold
(5:03:24) him accountable even if it falls flat okay even if it does but at least I'm showing I don't agree with how they
(5:03:30) portrayed me that's all I'm saying how did we portray you now do you actually want to
(5:03:37) understand because I feel I have explained things so many times and it's just like you don't want to get it let
(5:03:43) me okay let me ask you a couple questions of all the things that you said tonight and on your previous
(5:03:49) appearance on the dating talk show did I instruct you to say anything did I force
(5:03:57) you to say
(5:04:03) anything what's there to think it was
(5:04:12) first of all I am autistic legitimately so so am
(5:04:18) I okay so you know how it goes I saw you get very upset when we thought that
() 
(5:04:24) there was a nip slip and I I could see in you just I'm just trying to have a
(5:04:30) point of connection of I can understand why there would be this kind of really reaction in you because at our autistic
(5:04:36) minds are on a mission we got to get this done right my autistic self my
(5:04:41) autistic self and I'm not blaming you for this but my autistic self was on a
(5:04:47) mission I thought this was a particular situation I was getting into I come here
(5:04:52) and it's not at all that situation I thought so I'm already trying to like switch gears okay this is not going to
(5:04:57) be what I thought and then when that happened just because I do have these
(5:05:04) certain sensitivities okay so I'm already off kilter then that happened and from there I was literally just mama
(5:05:11) bear like trauma responding like basically what the is going on these guys are this is not what we
(5:05:17) thought it was girls like this is a fight they brought us for I'm simply saying that was what
(5:05:25) it was invoked in me and so that wasn't my best self that wasn't who I would
(5:05:31) want to portray myself but I felt because so it's our fault you acted that way
(5:05:39) I believe you took a misstep in not properly
(5:05:45) vetting people who would have like PTSD symptoms autism different neural
(5:05:51) divergences that would make a difference with how they're communica so it's so so just be clear it's our fault you acted
(5:05:59) that way it is your fault for getting
(5:06:05) this deeply into personal topics with women and not vetting them
(5:06:14) psychologically you realize that we have in in a given week we have two shows we
(5:06:19) have typically I mean the panels tend to be between 8 to 10 people two you you want me to do a
(5:06:26) psychological which I'm not just it could just literally a couple questions it could be like do you have a history
(5:06:33) of PTSD for example do you have any mental disorders that are under
(5:06:40) qualified to judge the meur even if they answered yes but I'm just saying at
(5:06:46) least then you would have attempted to there's you do realize hold on hold on
(5:06:52) like Andrew said I wouldn't be qualified to even make that assessment to begin with and then secondly if I borred all
(5:06:59) people who had any no uh any even perceived mental illness then I would just simply you'd probably attack me for
(5:07:06) not uh being inclusive and allowing owing people of different who who have
(5:07:11) diff who are uh not uh neurotypical it would not be inclusive
(5:07:16) to bring to only bring on neurotypical people I just thought it was very interesting how at the beginning of the
(5:07:23) show you made a big deal about like does anybody have the card the Black Card can you say that bro are you
(5:07:30) I first off we never said that Nick does a pre-show thing and he says
(5:07:36) don't say these words and that's a white Woman by the way who just dropped the hard R um so okay hold on let me
(5:07:45) redirect the conversation here um first off disavow her saying
(5:07:51) that to bring it back to you wanting me to do a psychological assessment of people by
(5:07:57) the way Nick does not say that he says don't use these words and he he says was
(5:08:04) talking about what Nick said he that's that's part of the pre-show well I wasn't talking about that I was talking
(5:08:10) that comes we did have a black here remember and then yeah but Nick says
(5:08:15) don't say the nword don't say this don't say that we don't want people saying that sort of stuff on stream anyways
(5:08:22) hold on I got to move it off I got to move it off of that so we have 20 people
(5:08:27) 20 new people every single week moving through the studio and then we get flakes every single show so we get up
(5:08:34) anywhere from we'll get for a given day 5 to 10 flakes there's no practical way
(5:08:40) that I could do a psychological assessment I could literally give you like a five five questions that you
(5:08:46) could ask that would vet them better at least at least something because you guys are getting into digging into their
(5:08:52) psyche their ideology most of women totally fine most of the women who
(5:08:58) come on are not it's so it's just I don't even understand your position I don't even understand your
(5:09:04) argument so you're saying we should have done that with you to have precluded you from coming on is that what you're
(5:09:10) saying yes or at least you would have known to properly say for examp why is it my duty how about it should be your
(5:09:16) duty to say I'm not prepared to have a
(5:09:21) conversation on a podcast that's your duty not mine well the thing is Brian we
(5:09:27) didn't just have a conversation you literally did an act a hostile work
(5:09:32) environment cussing act that literally if you had an HR you would not get away
(5:09:38) with that I am do you know um I think it's King Lou hold on hold on there's a French
(5:09:44) monarch and he said something along the lines of L Sima the state is me I am the
(5:09:51) state I'm the there is no HR department lady I know I'm I'm just saying that
(5:09:58) that was not appropriate behavior your entire conduct before the show which we
(5:10:04) went into on the show was inappropriate behavior you want to talk about professionalism inappropriate behavior
(5:10:10) I'm happy to have a conversation about it on June 16th did you send send to me
(5:10:16) without my consent or permission did you send a nude photograph of yourself to me to the whatever Instagram page yes or no
(5:10:23) did I I don't know I'm a hoe I don't know who I send nudes to on what day a uh what's the
() 
(5:10:30) term for it a uh uh an un did you send on June 16th
(5:10:37) did you send a nude photo to the whatever Instagram page that like uh
(5:10:42) what's it called there's a word for it DM no not a DM it's like a unrequested
(5:10:48) for unsolicited unsolicited you said yes thank you on June 16th did you send an
(5:10:53) unsolicited nude photograph to the whatever Instagram page I don't know did I you did okay so why are you asking me
(5:11:00) if you already know I did you you well because he's wondering if if you had taken the time to have him answer a
(5:11:08) series of psyche V question so that you would know if his emotional state could
(5:11:13) take you sending him a nude picture or not did you take the time to have him
(5:11:18) fill out a psych form before you sent him that new picture I asked him many personal questions about himself yeah
(5:11:25) but did you take the time to ask him if he would have PTSD from having an unsolicited imagine the trauma that
(5:11:31) could be caused from somebody why don't read all the messages leading up to that I probably did ask yeah perhaps some
(5:11:36) horrible things had happened in the past to PTSD the what I was saying up until the
(5:11:44) nude I mean you send literally a novel to me yeah but no I never you didn't ask
(5:11:51) for permission to send it there was no flirting at all Brian would you say that this has caused you some
(5:11:59) PTSD I think it probably has you want the joke answer the true answer uh well
(5:12:05) having having random women send you unsolicited news doesn't seem doesn't seem like um no I'm not it doesn't uh I
(5:12:14) wouldn't say I mean I don't want to uh from people who I have on the show I
(5:12:19) will say this you did get me there cuz I'm big on consent so you know what I'm going to say I kept it I we're even then
(5:12:26) I guess no I wait hold on you're big on consent you're big on consent but you
(5:12:32) walked over here no I know I'm say I got and back put your ass I got you back for any problems I had with you and
(5:12:38) I got you did he he didn't so I'm saying did I consent no you didn't okay so you do ad
(5:12:44) that's what I'm saying we're now even I feel that you just made restitution yeah with me it's actually battering people
(5:12:50) it's like hurting their feelings so you do admit to have just like that you do
(5:12:55) admit to having had sent a uh unsolicited nude to the whatever insam
(5:13:01) page you said that I did I can't I don't have it up to see what around the context but if you're saying that I
(5:13:06) cannot show it you can't can we put it on your only fans I don't know why you find this to
(5:13:12) be a I mean fans would want to see can I have it back to put on my only fans but see you you want to like play this game
(5:13:19) of like well Brian here's how you uh you don't always conduct yourself
(5:13:25) perfectly who are you to talk I said true you got me I already
(5:13:30) said I submitted you're right you guys I have been rude I have been conceited I have been not listening to you you
(5:13:37) wanted it Brian you deserved it right I apparently sent you an unsolicited nude
(5:13:42) which is like a sexual assault I mean it is well and then I put
(5:13:48) my ass in your face again a sexual assault so I'm guilty you're right and I like you guys and I agreed to come
(5:13:55) because it's as hard as it is for me because again I don't get challenged that much and we can call that my female
(5:14:01) privilege my pretty female privilege or whatever the you want to call it
(5:14:07) but I don't often feel stimulated by the males that are out
(5:14:14) here right now and you guys at least stimulated some part of me that wanted to engage again we were boring well you
(5:14:22) it got better maybe it's because I just because was all about you your favorite
(5:14:28) topic it was all about your favorite topic no because you did actually get me
(5:14:34) on a point that I couldn't deny you're right that was not appropriate got I love it I actually enjoy when that does
(5:14:41) happen and I concede you're right
(5:14:46) okay see I like the checks and balances that men and women bring each other I think it's fun I only ever wanted to
(5:14:54) like okay let's talk about like heated stuff and passionate stuff but like as
(5:14:59) friends like just as friends your lady who used you're threatening
(5:15:05) litigation well that think like friends you remember like a couple weeks ago me and Brian were were eating a
() 
(5:15:12) cheeseburger and and I was like could you pass me the ketchup and he was like no bro grab the ketchup yourself and so
(5:15:17) I've been I've been launching lawsuits ever since that were frivolous and vexatious but that's what because
(5:15:22) that's what friends do that's that's listen listen Karen okay I don't have
(5:15:28) the same access to him this is all I had to engage and to say basically I feel
(5:15:35) very violated by this I just want I need some sort of peace about what the
(5:15:40) was that just some sort of after care you could say after care when there's a rupture in psychologists call it a
(5:15:47) rupture a rupture in our relationship Dynamic even as colleagues as whatever
(5:15:53) you did it to get his attention no I did it in order to make a statement for my own kind of
(5:16:02) moving forward moving past it I needed to make a stance of like I did not like
(5:16:09) he needed to know about it yes and he needed to engage with it he didn't have to he didn't really but you kept on
(5:16:15) going till he did to the point where he even sent a nude to him right no I think definitely sound way back then doesn't
(5:16:21) it sound like nudes the nude was so long ago yeah but isn't that attention seeking
(5:16:26) Behavior I send nudes when I'm feeling like you need some attention no it's not
(5:16:33) an attention thing it's it's a way for me to try to show a man I'm not out to get you I'm trying to engage with you in
(5:16:40) and different you want you want me and hold on I'm just interrupting here you want me and Andrew to uh not exist and
(5:16:48) you're also threatening me with frous lawsuits take I will take back the wishing you you say that now but just
(5:16:55) like the previous show when when we uh I think challenged you oh you're just going to go out and talk a bunch of
(5:17:02) you posted like hundreds of stories about the whatever podcast you've been sending novels to the whatever Instagram
(5:17:08) page you're threatening frivolous and vexatious legal action um I mean it's
(5:17:14) just it's just insanity and you say I mean frankly I I my ideal would be that
(5:17:23) this is the end of our uh Association and you go on with your life
(5:17:29) and I go on with mine and you're in the rearview mirror and likewise for you but
(5:17:35) I know you you're going to be hemming and Hauling about this for months to come you're going to be probably trying
(5:17:41) to who knows what you're going to do but um is that what you
(5:17:47) want what do you mean I want you to just move on with your life and stop
(5:17:52) threatening legal action okay and just and remember well and also not take
(5:17:58) legal action the wise woman according to you
(5:18:03) the wise woman once said and this is your opening line of your book this  and she lived happily ever after
(5:18:11) hang on this opening your book a wise woman once said this iot and she lived happily ever after so how
(5:18:18) about you off and go live happily ever after all right I
(5:18:25) will um in any case uh it would be nice
(5:18:31) to attempt to end things on a good note but I don't think in good faith you would actually be able to uh agree that
(5:18:37) this is the end of Association although it's certainly sign a contract write it up I'll sign it why don't you just look
(5:18:44) into this camera right here this is a legally binding statement although you did sign a a the talent the waiver I
(5:18:53) signed the waiver I read it I felt comfortable with it and I brought my no
(5:18:58) button and I had my little fits and I feel that looking into the camera you
(5:19:05) you agree to hold Brian in Atlas And whatever harmless of any claims now or
(5:19:13) in the future that may arise from your appearance on the podcast you disclaim
(5:19:18) any sort of or uh you um I'm not a lawyer here I understand what you're saying uh you relink any and all claim
(5:19:26) non-disclosure agreement basically yes I agree not a non-disclosure but in any case um so you have my hope my hope for
(5:19:35) you to for you would be I mean for the sake of yourself and I mean trying to continue continue to
(5:19:41) pursue the whatever podcast I don't think will be productive for you I I already said I wouldn't I gave you my
(5:19:48) word well you say that now but well didn't you write me up something to sign I'll sign it I didn't write it up I'll
(5:19:54) sign it just look at the camera and say I'm not going to sue whatever I am not going to sue whatever I don't know if that's and I'm not going to bother Brian
(5:20:00) Atlas anymore and I'm not going to bother Brian Alice anymore he doesn't want to and I totally am responsible for
(5:20:06) sexual battery of Andrew Wilson and that's why I'm totally responsible for sexually assaulting the
(5:20:13) Youth of America apparently uh I guess well that's a different crime well
(5:20:19) they're at least 18 right they're at least 18 right uh final question final question do you think me and Andrew a
(5:20:25) misogynist what's a misogynist tell me what the your definition values um
(5:20:30) values men men's priorities primarily over women's most charitable do you
(5:20:36) definition I can give do you no no well then I don't believe you're a misogynist yeah do you Brian do I what value men's
(5:20:44) priorities over women's I don't even think that's the definition I know I'm giving the most charitable one I can well you can give
(5:20:51) it to me raw I mean is there a better definition I'll pass on that one usually it's tailored towards hatred towards
(5:20:56) women so I wouldn't say that I value yeah I wouldn't say that I value the priorities of men over women I just
(5:21:02) think that men generally have priorities which I support more than women's that's a confusing way to State
(5:21:09) it but you're saying no you're not a misogynist yeah okay well then I I'll
(5:21:14) you're you only you know if you're a misogynist yeah I'm a misandrist what's that so I I probably hate men as much as
(5:21:21) you do honestly I really hate most people to be honest it's nothing personal to men I hate a bunch of women
(5:21:27) too so don't take it personally uh do you want to walk back your statements about me and Andrew uh
(5:21:34) because of who we are we should not be alive she yeah I apologized for that I
(5:21:40) said I take it back I hope you this going to be so much
(5:21:45) so expensive the kind of psychological trauma that I've had to endure tonight the PTSD you a book it'll
(5:21:52) help you from this battery it I don't I don't know how I'm going to I wrote the book just to help people survive the

(5:36:35) degenerate okay it's pretty degenerate I guess guilty that is where women I
(5:36:41) will say that we do take Liberties because for the most part any and all
(5:36:49) flirtatious banter is usually received pretty well with a man so I I personally
(5:36:56) use it more of I'm either genuinely like in a I'm in a playful mood and I'm just
(5:37:03) sharing that with the man that's in my aura right then Assuming he's not
(5:37:09) married or anything like that I use it for that or if I'm trying to shift the mood into a more playful space so if you
(5:37:16) want to call that manipulation tactics and evil okay but I don't do it with malice
(5:37:23) of forethought or to do anything other than try to reach a man to have better
(5:37:28) communication with him for the purpose of reconciling like coming back together

(5:37:40) air I really like to clear the air as I go with people no I don't understand though like maybe you can Reon so cuz

(5:37:55) reciprocation of me to a woman who wasn't my wife what the would ever make you think it would be with you I
(5:38:02) wouldn't that's why it was being that's why it was just being I was honestly I

(5:51:56) the subject matter expert dude that was too
(5:52:03) much more intellectual your strategy on this was to come on and make yourself look better to the courts by saying
(5:52:10) you'd kill your kids by lethal injection if you didn't like their life would hold them
(5:52:15) accountable it was so that the court would know I would hold my own children to the same accountability that I would
(5:52:22) hold even myself or anybody else by the way sft it's a bold strategy C let see if it P Des your dress looks like an
(5:52:30) ugly green window Valance Lon Vans L book since you don't understand n z skib

(5:52:50) you should I mean you guys can see some of what goes on on the shows that me and Andrew have to deal with better I asked
(5:52:57) what you guys wanted me to wear and you weren't getting back to me okay you see what happens on the show that me and
(5:53:04) Andrew have to deal with I can tell you that's the tip of the I when it comes to what Andrew deals with what I deal with
(5:53:10) you think what goes on the show stresses us out it's everything that you never hear about that happens behind the
(5:53:16) scenes that the stress new they get the conversations while sometimes can be
(5:53:21) annoying or frustrating un solicited ass hold on hold on it's not even that honestly it's so I think Andrew can
(5:53:26) agree it's he wanted it he wanted it I think you didn't obviously I think
(5:53:33) Andrew would agree on this I would agree on it it's what you see on the show is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to
(5:53:38) like the nonsense that we have to deal with so uh yeah the show is good the
(5:53:45) show I'm cool with the show Show's great the show's good it's everything behind the scenes the lunatics who come after
